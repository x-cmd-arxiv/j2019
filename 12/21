Local parametric fractal features extracted via maximum likelihood\nestimation from five well-known statistical model families are evaluated for\nthe purpose of ultrasound tissue characterization. The fractal dimension\n(self-similarity measure) was used to characterize the spatial distribution of\nscatterers, while the Lacunarity (sparsity measure) was applied to determine\nscatterer number density. Performance was assessed based on 608 cross-sectional\nclinical ultrasound RF images of liver tumors (230 and 378 demonstrating\nrespondent and non-respondent cases, respectively). Crossvalidation via\nleave-one-tumor-out and with different k-folds methodologies using a Bayesian\nclassifier were employed for validation.

However, the reserves provision\nand activation remain an exclusive responsibility of regional operators. This\nlimited spatial coordination and the sequential market structure hinder the\nefficient utilization of flexible generation and transmission, since their\ncapacities have to be ex-ante allocated between energy and reserves. To promote\nreserve exchange, recent work has proposed a preemptive model that defines the\noptimal inter-area transmission capacities for energy and reserves reducing the\nexpected system cost. This decision-support tool, formulated as a stochastic\nbilevel program, respects the current architecture but does not suggest\narea-specific costs that guarantee sufficient incentives for all areas to\naccept the proposed solution. To this end, we formulate a preemptive model in a\nframework that allows the application of coalitional game theory methods to\nobtain a stable benefit allocation, i.e., an outcome immune to coalitional\ndeviations ensuring willingness of all areas to coordinate. We show that\nbenefit allocation mechanisms can be formulated either at the day-ahead or the\nreal-time stages, in order to distribute the expected or the scenario-specific\nbenefits, respectively. For both games, the proposed benefits achieve minimal\nstability violation, while allowing for a tractable computation with limited\nqueries to the bilevel program.

With the Dual Data Feed structure, both the\nhigh-frequency data and the corresponding Beat Tone data are fed into the DNN\nto relieve the burden of feature extraction, thus reducing the network\ncomplexity and the training cost. The second strategy, Progressive Transfer\nLearning, enables us to unbiasedly train the DNN using a single training\ndataset.

The advantage of the proposed approach is\nthat, as opposed to the axial current, the helicity charge current remains\nconserved at finite mass. A computation of thermal expectation values of the\nvector, helicity and axial charge currents, as well as of the fermion\ncondensate and stress-energy tensor is provided. In all cases, analytic\nconstitutive equations are derived for the non-equilibrium transport terms, as\nwell as for the quantum corrections to the equilibrium terms (which are derived\nusing an effective relativistic kinetic theory model for fermions with helicity\nimbalance) in the limit of small masses. In the context of the parameters which\nare relevant to relativistic heavy ion collisions, the expressions derived in\nthe massless limit are shown to remain valid for masses up to the thermal\nenergy, except for the axial charge conductivity in the azimuthal direction,\nwhich presents strong variations with the particle mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 18:01:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 06:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

However, automated segmentation of\nparafoveal OCTA images is still an open problem. In this study, we generate the\nfirst open dataset of retinal parafoveal OCTA images with associated ground\ntruth manual segmentations. Furthermore, we establish a standard for OCTA image\nsegmentation by surveying a broad range of state-of-the-art vessel enhancement\nand binarisation procedures. We provide the most comprehensive comparison of\nthese methods under a unified framework to date. Our results show that, for the\nset of images considered, deep learning architectures (U-Net and CS-Net)\nachieve the best performance. For applications where manually segmented data is\nnot available to retrain these approaches, our findings suggest that optimal\noriented flux is the best handcrafted filter from those considered.\nFurthermore, we report on the importance of preserving network structure in the\nsegmentation to enable deep vascular phenotyping. We introduce new metrics for\nnetwork structure evaluation in segmented angiograms. Our results demonstrate\nthat segmentation methods with equal Dice score perform very differently in\nterms of network structure preservation. Moreover, we compare the error in the\ncomputation of clinically relevant vascular network metrics (e.g. foveal\navascular zone area and vessel density) across segmentation methods.

To test\nthis mechanism further, we model the dust continuum and polarization data of HD\n163296, one of the best observed disks with prominent rings and gaps, using the\nRADMC-3D radiative transfer code. We find that scattering by grains with a\nmaximum size of 90$\\mu$m can simultaneously reproduce the polarization observed\nat 0.87 mm (ALMA Band 7) and the unusually low spectral index of $\\alpha$ ~ 1.5\nbetween 0.87 and 1.25 mm (ALMA Band 6) in the optically thick inner disk as a\nresult of more efficient scattering at a shorter wavelength. The relatively low\nspectral index of $\\alpha$ ~ 2.5 inferred for the optically thin gaps is also\nreproduced by the same (relatively small) grains, as a result of telescope beam\naveraging of the gaps (with an intrinsic $\\alpha$ ~ 4) and their adjacent\noptically thick rings (where $\\alpha$ << 2). In this case, the long-standing\ntension between the grain sizes inferred from polarization and spectral index\ndisappears because the relatively low $\\alpha$ values are illusory and do not\nrequire large mm-sized grains. In addition, the polarization fraction has a\nunique pattern of azimuthal variation: higher along the major axis than the\nminor axis in the gaps but higher along the minor axis than the major axis in\nthe rings.

This allows it\nto hide in traditional tests of gravity. However, the past decade has seen\ngreat experimental progress towards measuring screened forces in the laboratory\nor in space. Screening relies on nonlinearities in the equation of motion,\nwhich significantly complicates the theoretical analysis of such forces. Here,\nwe present a calculation of the symmetron force between a dense plate and\nsphere surrounded by vacuum. This is done via semi-analytical approaches in two\nlimiting cases, based on the size of the sphere: large spheres are analyzed via\nthe proximity force approximation, whilst small spheres are treated as screened\ntest particles. In the intermediate regime we solve the problem numerically.\nOur results allow us to make contact with Casimir force experiments, which\noften employ a plate and sphere configuration for practical reasons, and may\ntherefore be used to constrain symmetrons.

The forecasts compare favorably\nto other leading laboratory tests of gravity, particularly atom interferometry\nand bouncing neutrons. We thus conclude that near-future Casimir experiments\nwill be capable of placing tight new bounds on symmetrons.

For instance, Stealthy Link Flooding Attack (SLFA) is a variant of\nDDoS attacks that strives to block access to a target area by flooding a small\nset of links, and it is shown that it can bypass traditional DDoS defense\nmechanisms. One potential solution to tackle such SLFAs is to apply Moving\nTarget Defense (MTD) techniques in which network settings are dynamically\nchanged to confuse/deceive attackers, thus making it highly expensive to launch\na successful attack. However, since MTD comes with some overhead to the\nnetwork, to find the best strategy (i.e., when and/or to what extent) of\napplying it has been a major challenge. The strategy is significantly\ninfluenced by the attacker's behavior that is often difficult to guess. In this\nwork, we address the challenge of obtaining the optimal MTD strategy that\neffectively mitigates SLFAs while incurs a minimal overhead. We design the\nproblem as a signaling game considering the network defender and the attacker\nas players. A belief function is established throughout the engagement of the\nattacker and the defender during this SLFA campaign, which is utilized to pick\nthe best response/action for each player. We analyze the game model and derive\na defense mechanism based on the equilibria of the game. We evaluate the\ntechnique on a Mininet-based network environment where an attacker is\nperforming SLFAs and a defender applies MTD based on equilibria of the game.\nThe results show that our signaling game-based dynamic defense mechanism can\nprovide a similar level of protection against SLFAs like the extensive MTD\nsolution, however, causing a significantly reduced overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 19:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

Learning\ntrajectories from physiological signals continuously measured during an ICU\nstay requires learning time-series features that are robust and discriminative\nacross diverse patient populations. Patients within different ICU populations\n(referred here as domains) vary by age, conditions and interventions. Thus,\nmortality prediction models using patient data from a particular ICU population\nmay perform suboptimally in other populations because the features used to\ntrain such models have different distributions across the groups. In this\npaper, we explore domain adaptation strategies in order to learn mortality\nprediction models that extract and transfer complex temporal features from\nmultivariate time-series ICU data. Features are extracted in a way that the\nstate of the patient in a certain time depends on the previous state. This\nenables dynamic predictions and creates a mortality risk space that describes\nthe risk of a patient at a particular time. Experiments based on cross-ICU\npopulations reveals that our model outperforms all considered baselines. Gains\nin terms of AUC range from 4% to 8% for early predictions when compared with a\nrecent state-of-the-art representative for ICU mortality prediction. In\nparticular, models for the Cardiac ICU population achieve AUC numbers as high\nas 0.88, showing excellent clinical utility for early mortality prediction.\nFinally, we present an explanation of factors contributing to the possible ICU\noutcomes, so that our models can be used to complement clinical reasoning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 19:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

More\nspecifically, we prove that SGD solutions are connected via a piecewise linear\npath, and the increase in loss along this path vanishes as the number of\nneurons grows large. This result is a consequence of the fact that the\nparameters found by SGD are increasingly dropout stable as the network becomes\nwider.

Here, detailed boundary integral simulations are\nperformed to investigate an idealized model flow flow in SCD, a binary\nsuspension of flexible biconcave discoidal fluid-filled capsules and stiff\ncurved prolate capsules that represent healthy and sickle RBCs, respectively,\nsubjected to pressure-driven flow in a planar slit. The key observation is\nthat, unlike healthy RBCs that concentrate around the center of the channel and\nform an RBC-depleted layer (i.e. cell-free layer) next to the walls, sickle\ncells are largely drained from the bulk of the suspension and aggregate inside\nthe cell-free layer, displaying strong margination. These cells are found to\nundergo a rigid-body-like rolling orbit near the walls. Furthermore, the\nadditional shear stress on the walls induced by the presence of marginated\ncells is computed. Compared to the small fluctuations in wall shear stress for\na suspension of healthy RBCs, large local peaks in wall shear stress are\nobserved for the binary suspensions, due to the proximity of the marginated\nstiff cells to the walls. As endothelial cells are known to mechanotransduce\nphysical forces such as aberrations in shear stress and convert them to\nphysiological processes such as activation of inflammatory signals, these\nresults may aid in understanding mechanisms for endothelial dysfunction\nassociated with SCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 21:06:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 03:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

The typical setting of coherent communication\nschemes is based on a single data stream with multiple transmitters and a\nsingle receiver. This paper studies the case of multiple concurrent data\nstreams, each with multiple transmitters and multiple receivers, in\nself-organizing wireless networks. A distributed optimization solution based on\njoint network formation and beamforming is developed for coherent group\ncommunications in a network of nodes that need to communicate over long\ndistances. This solution significantly improves the power gain for a single\ndata stream and the signal-to-interference-ratio for multiple data streams\ncompared to point-to-point communications. These gains are in turn translated\nto improvements in communication range, power efficiency, reliability, and\nthroughput. In this multi-layer network optimization solution, nodes coordinate\nwith each other in a distributed manner to form transmitter and receiver\ngroups, and communicate with each other coherently over long distances. The\ncoherent beamforming protocol is optimized for given transmitter and receiver\ngroups, whereas the network formation protocol is optimized to determine these\ngroups.

Our\nframework follows a twofold biologically inspired approach. The first step\nconsists of estimating the passage of time from sensor measurements, since\nenvironmental stimuli influence the perception of time. Sensor data is modeled\nas Gaussian processes that represent the second-order statistics of the natural\nenvironment. The estimated elapsed time between two events is computed from the\nmaximum likelihood estimate of the joint distribution of the data collected\nbetween them. Moreover, exactly how time is encoded in the brain remains\nunknown, but there is strong evidence of the involvement of dopaminergic\nneurons in timing mechanisms. Since their phasic activity has a similar\nbehavior to the reward prediction error of temporal-difference learning models,\nthe latter are used to replicate this behavior. The second step of this\napproach consists therefore of applying the agent's estimate of the elapsed\ntime in a reinforcement learning problem, where a feature representation called\nMicrostimuli is used.

Specifically, the speaker embeddings\nlearned from normal speech via the speech synthesis objective are shared with\nthose learned from singing samples via the singing synthesis objective in the\nunified training framework. This makes the learned speaker embedding a\ntransferable representation for both speaking and singing. We evaluate the\nproposed algorithm on singing voice conversion task where the content of\noriginal singing is covered with the timbre of another speaker's voice learned\npurely from their normal speech samples.

These approaches typically use classifiers such as support vector\nmachines, to set the operating envelope by learning the boundary in the\noperational parameter spaces between the manually assigned `large KPI' and\n`small KPI' groups. One challenge to these approaches is that the assignment to\nthese groups is often ad-hoc and hence arbitrary.

Both sides of the LV boundaries exhibit natural elliptical\ncurvatures by having details on various scales, i.e. exhibiting fractal-like\ncharacteristics.

By virtue\nof high-dimensional geometry, we propose a very simple algorithm, called\nSpherical Auto-Encoder (SAE), completely different from existing VAEs to\naddress the issue. SAE is in essence the vanilla autoencoder with spherical\nnormalization on the latent space. We analyze the unique characteristics of\nrandom variables on spheres in high dimensions and argue that random variables\non spheres are agnostic to various prior distributions and data modes when the\ndimension is sufficiently high. Therefore, SAE can harness a high-dimensional\nlatent space to improve the inference precision of latent codes while maintain\nthe property of stochastic sampling from priors.

This paper contemplates two extensions of the Heston\nstochastic volatility model. Out of which, one considers the addition of jumps\nto the stock price process (a stochastic volatility jump diffusion model) and\nanother considers an additional stochastic volatility factor varying at a\ndifferent time scale (a multiscale stochastic volatility model). An empirical\nanalysis is carried out on the market data of options with different strike\nprices and maturities, to compare the pricing performance of these models and\nto capture their implied volatility fit.

However, unlike divergence-free methods, this\nrelaxation leads to a pressure-dependent contribution in the velocity error\nwhich is proportional to the inverse of the viscosity, thus resulting in\nmethods that lack pressure robustness and have difficulties in preserving\nstructures at high Reynolds numbers.

We\nstudy a network of integrate-and-fire neurons with several types of recurrent\nconnections that learns the structure of its time-varying feedforward input by\nattempting to efficiently represent this input with spikes. The efficiency of\nthe representation arises from incorporating the structure of the input into\nthe decoder, which is implicit in the learned synaptic connectivity of the\nnetwork. While in the original work of [Boerlin, Machens, Den\\`eve 2013] and\n[Brendel et al., 2017] the structure learned by the network to make the\nrepresentation efficient was the low-dimensionality of the feedforward input,\nin the present work it is its temporal dynamics. The network achieves the\nefficiency by adjusting its synaptic weights in such a way, that for any neuron\nin the network, the recurrent input cancels the feedforward for most of the\ntime. We show that if the only temporal structure that the input possesses is\nthat it changes slowly on the time scale of neuronal integration, the\ndimensionality of the network dynamics is equal to the dimensionality of the\ninput. However, if the input follows a linear differential equation of the\nfirst order, the efficiency of the representation can be increased by\nincreasing the dimensionality of the network dynamics in comparison to the\ndimensionality of the input. If there is only one type of slow synaptic current\nin the network, the increase is two-fold, while if there are two types of slow\nsynaptic currents that decay with different rates and whose amplitudes can be\nadjusted separately, it is advantageous to make the increase three-fold.

The robust estimation is usually based on solving camera\ngeometry problems from a minimal number of input data measurements, i.e.\nsolving minimal problems in a RANSAC framework. Minimal problems often result\nin complex systems of polynomial equations. Many state-of-the-art efficient\npolynomial solvers to these problems are based on Gr\\\"obner bases and the\naction-matrix method that has been automatized and highly optimized in recent\nyears. In this paper we study an alternative algebraic method for solving\nsystems of polynomial equations, i.e., the sparse resultant-based method and\npropose a novel approach to convert the resultant constraint to an eigenvalue\nproblem. This technique can significantly improve the efficiency and stability\nof existing resultant-based solvers. We applied our new resultant-based method\nto a large variety of computer vision problems and show that for most of the\nconsidered problems, the new method leads to solvers that are the same size as\nthe the best available Gr\\\"obner basis solvers and of similar accuracy. For\nsome problems the new sparse-resultant based method leads to even smaller and\nmore stable solvers than the state-of-the-art Gr\\\"obner basis solvers.

A geometrical image of acoustic\nanisotropy can be an important tool in design of devices based on wave\npropagation in single crystals or combinations of anisotropic materials.

We present the\ngeneralization of these expressions to $n$ entangled distinguishable\nsubsystems, which could become relevant in the future if it becomes possible to\nadd neutron orbital angular momentum to the experimentally-accessible list of\nentangled modes. We view this work as a necessary first step towards a\ntheoretical description of entangled neutron scattering from strongly entangled\nmatter, and we explain why it should be possible to formulate a useful\ngeneralization of the usual Van Hove linear response theory for this case. We\nalso briefly describe some other scientific extensions and applications which\ncan benefit from interferometric measurements using the types of single-neutron\nmultimode entanglement described by this analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Dec 2019 15:49:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

In addition, a Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) was derived from the\nmultistep ME, assuming the continuity of the state variable. The developed\napproach and an FPE based approach (Gardiner 2004) were used to find the mean\nfirst passage time (MFPT) of the transition between the negative and positive\nstable macrostates of dust grain charge when the charging process was bistable.\nThe dust was in a plasma and charged by collecting ions and electrons, and\nemitting secondary electrons. The MFPTs for the transitioning of grain charge\nfrom one macrostate to the other were calculated by the two approaches for a\nrange of grain sizes.

Deepfake is a variant of auto-encoders that use\ndeep learning techniques to identify and exchange images of a person's face in\na picture or film.

METHODS A total of 740 unbound\nMPA (uMPA), 741 total MPA (tMPA) and 734 total MPAG (tMPAG) concentration-time\ndata from 58 Chinese kidney transplant patients were analysed using a nonlinear\nmixed-effect model. The influence of covariates was tested using a stepwise\nprocedure. RESULTS The PK of unbound MPA and MPAG were characterised by a two-\nand one-compartment model with first-order elimination, respectively. Apparent\nclearance of uMPA (CLuMPA/F) was estimated to be 852 L/h with a relative\nstandard error (RSE) of 7.1%. The tMPA and uMPA were connected using a linear\nprotein binding model, in which the protein binding rate constant (kB)\nincreased non-linearly with the serum albumin (ALB) concentration. The\nestimated kB was 53.4 /h (RSE, 2.3%) for patients with ALB of 40 g/L. In\naddition, model-based simulation showed that changes in ALB substantially\naffected tMPA but not uMPA exposure. CONCLUSIONS The established model\nadequately described the population PK characteristics of the uMPA, tMPA, and\nMPAG. The estimated CLuMPA/F and unbound fraction of MPA (FUMPA) in Chinese\nkidney transplant recipients were comparable to those published previously in\nCaucasians.
