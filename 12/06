State of the art\naudio-visual speech separation methods shows that crucial information is the\nmovement of the facial landmarks related to speech production.

In order to overcome this limitation, we propose the use of\nevent-driven cameras and exploit compression, high temporal resolution and low\nlatency, for low cost and low latency motion feature extraction, going towards\nonline embedded audio-visual speech processing. We use the event-driven optical\nflow estimation of the facial landmarks as input to a stacked Bidirectional\nLSTM trained to predict an Ideal Amplitude Mask that is then used to filter the\nnoisy audio, to obtain the audio signal of the target speaker.

However, the presence of a\nground-state electric dipole for these nanoparticles has not yet been\ninvestigated. We therefore used transient electric birefringence (TEB) to probe\nthe electric dipole of 5-monolayer thick zinc-blende CdSe NPL with a\nparallelepipedic shape. We studied a dilute dispersion of isolated NPL coated\nwith branched ligands and we measured, as a function of time, the birefringence\ninduced by DC and AC field pulses. The electro-optic behavior proves the\npresence of a large dipolar moment (> 245 D) oriented along the length of the\nplatelets. We then induced the slow face-to-face stacking of the NPL by adding\noleic acid. In these stacks, the in-plane dipole components of consecutive NPL\ncancel whereas their normal components add. Moreover, interestingly, the excess\npolarizability tensor of the NPL stacks gives rise to an electro-optic\ncontribution opposite to that of the electric dipole. By monitoring the TEB\nsignal of the slowly-growing stacks over up to a year, we extracted the\nevolution of their average length with time and we showed that their\nelectro-optic response can be explained by the presence of a 80 D dipolar\ncomponent parallel to their normal. In spite of the $\\bar{4}$3m space group of\nbulk ZB CdSe, these NPL thus bear an important ground-state dipole whose\nmagnitude per unit volume is twice that found for wurtzite CdSe nanorods. We\ndiscuss the possible origin of this electric dipole, its consequences for the\noptical properties of these nanoparticles, and how it could explain their\nstrong stacking propensity that severely hampers their colloidal stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 16:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-09"}

We have found evidence of\nnon-Kolmogorov dome turbulence from our observations with the imaka wide field\nadaptive optics system; PSFs seem to indicate an excess of high spatial\nfrequencies and turbulence profiles reveal turbulence at negative conjugations.\nThis has motivated the development of a new type of optical turbulence sensor\ncalled AIR-FLOW, Airborne Interferometric Recombiner: Fluctuations of Light at\nOptical Wavelengths. It is a non-redundant mask imaging interferometer that\nsamples the optical turbulence passing through a measurement cell and it\nmeasures the two-dimensional optical Phase Structure Function. This is a useful\ntool to characterise different types of turbulence (e.g. Kolmogorov, diffusive\nturbulence, etc.).

The\ninstrument was tested at the Canada France Hawaii Telescope, at the University\nof Hawaii 2.2-meter telescope (UH88'') and at the Observatoire de la C{\\^o}te\nd'Azur. It is ruggedised and sensitive enough to detect changes with different\ndome vent configurations, as well as slow local variations of the index of\nrefraction in the UH88'' telescope tube. The instrument is portable enough that\nit can be used to locate sources of turbulence inside and around domes, but it\ncan also be used in an operational setting without affecting observations to\ncharacterise the local optical turbulence responsible for dome seeing. Thus, it\ncould be used in real-time observatory control systems to configure vents and\nair handlers to effectively reduce dome seeing.

While thorough study of transport modes has been done for\nstandard three-dimensional Fermi liquids, an equally in-depth analysis for two\ndimensional Fermi liquids is lacking. In applying the Landau kinetic equation\n(LKE) to a two-dimensional Fermi liquid, we obtain unconventional behavior of\nthe zero sound mode $c_0$. As a function of the usual dimensionless parameter\n$s=\\omega/qv_F$, we find two peculiar results: First, for $|s|>1$ we see the\npropagation of an undamped mode for weakly interacting systems. This differs\nfrom the three dimensional case where an undamped mode only propagates for\nrepulsive interactions and the mode experiences Landau damping for any\narbitrary attractive interaction. Second, we find that regardless of\ninteraction strength, a propagating mode is forbidden for $|s|<1$. This is\nprofoundly different from the three-dimensional case where a mode can\npropagate, albeit damped.

In view of the underlying symmetric\nstructure, the involved time-changes and weights remarkably depend only on the\norder of the U-statistic, and have consequently a universal nature.

The type of machine learning that we employ is reservoir computing. We\npresent numerical tests on link inference of a network of interacting dynamical\nnodes. It is seen that dynamical noise can greatly enhance the effectiveness of\nour technique, while observational noise degrades the effectiveness. We believe\nthat the competition between these two opposing types of noise will be the key\nfactor determining the success of causal inference in many of the most\nimportant application situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 16:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

In this study, we propose an experimental BCI to control\nan immersive telepresence system using motor imagery (MI). The system is\nimmersive in the sense that the users can control the movement of a NAO\nhumanoid robot in a first person perspective (1PP), i.e., as if the movement of\nthe robot was his/her own. We analyze functional brain connectivity between 1PP\nand 3PP during the control of our BCI using graph theory properties such as\ndegree, betweenness centrality, and efficiency. Changes in these metrics are\nobtained for the case of the 1PP, as well as for the traditional third person\nperspective (3PP) in which the user can see the movement of the robot as\nfeedback. As proof-of-concept, electroencephalography (EEG) signals were\nrecorded from two subjects while they performed MI to control the movement of\nthe robot. The graph theoretical analysis was applied to the binary directed\nnetworks obtained through the partial directed coherence (PDC). In our\npreliminary assessment we found that the efficiency in the alpha brain rhythm\nis greater in 1PP condition in comparison to the 3PP at the prefrontal cortex.\nAlso, a stronger influence of signals measured at EEG channel C3 (primary motor\ncortex) to other regions was found in 1PP condition. Furthermore, our\npreliminary results seem to indicate that alpha and beta brain rhythms have a\nhigh indegree at prefrontal cortex in 1PP condition, and this could be possibly\nrelated to the experience of sense of agency. Therefore, using the PDC combined\nwith graph theory while controlling a telepresence robot in an immersive system\nmay contribute to understand the organization and behavior of brain networks in\nthese environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 16:58:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-09"}

The RV\nsearch around young stars is a challenge as they are generally faster rotators\nthan older stars of similar spectral types and they exhibit signatures of\nmagnetic activity (spots) or pulsation in their RV time series. Specific\nanalyses are necessary to characterize, and possibly correct for, this\nactivity. Our aim is to search for planets around young nearby stars and to\nestimate the giant planet (GP) occurrence rates for periods up to 1000 days. We\nused the HARPS spectrograph on the 3.6m telescope at La Silla Observatory to\nobserve 89 A-M young (< 600 Myr) stars.

To\naddress this gap in knowledge, we considered a group of 20 healthy subjects\nduring an EEG-based hand motor imagery (MI) task. We studied two\nwell-established FC estimators, i.e. spectral- and imaginary-coherence, and\ninvestigated how they were modulated by the MI task. We characterized the\nresulting FC networks by extracting the strength of connectivity of each EEG\nsensor and compared the discriminant power with respect to standard power\nspectrum features. At the group level, results showed that while\nspectral-coherence based network features were increasing the controlateral\nmotor area, those based on imaginary-coherence were decreasing. We demonstrated\nthat this opposite, but complementary, behavior was respectively determined by\nthe increase in amplitude and phase synchronization between the brain signals.\nAt the individual level, we proved that including these network connectivity\nfeatures in the classification of MI mental states led to an overall\nimprovement in accuracy. Taken together, our results provide fresh insights\ninto the oscillatory mechanisms subserving brain network changes during MI and\noffer new perspectives to improve BCI performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 17:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-06"}

Reorienting problem is\nchallenging because of its non-smoothness and high dimensionality. In this\nwork, we focus on solving reorienting using pivoting, in which we allow the\ngrasped object to rotate between fingers. Pivoting decouples the gripper\nrotation from the object motion, making it possible to reorient an object under\nstrict robot workspace constraints. We provide detailed mechanical analysis to\nthe 3D pivoting motion on a table, which leads to simple geometric conditions\nfor its stability. To solve reorienting problems, we introduce two motion\nprimitives: pivot-on-support and roll-on-support, and provide an efficient\nhierarchical motion planning algorithm with the two motion primitives to solve\nfor the gripper motions that reorient an object between arbitrary poses.

Bayesian neural networks, which learn\ndistributions over the parameters of the network, are theoretically\nwell-motivated by Bayesian principles, but do not perform as well as deep\nensembles in practice, particularly under dataset shift. One possible\nexplanation for this gap between theory and practice is that popular scalable\nvariational Bayesian methods tend to focus on a single mode, whereas deep\nensembles tend to explore diverse modes in function space.

Therefore, these systems do not admit a\nlow-energy Lagrangian description.

One of the most controversial ones is the precise way in which\nshort-distance constraints get saturated by resonance exchange, particularly in\nthe so-called Melnikov-Vainshtein (MV) limit. In this paper we address this and\nrelated issues from a novel perspective, employing a warped five-dimensional\nmodel as a tool to generate a consistent realization of QCD in the large-$N_c$\nlimit. This approach differs from previous ones in that we can work at the\nlevel of an effective action, which guarantees that unitarity is preserved and\nthe chiral anomaly is consistently implemented at the hadronic level. We use\nthe model to evaluate the inclusive contribution of Goldstone modes and\naxial-vector mesons to the HLbL. We find that both anomaly matching and the MV\nconstraint cannot be fulfilled with a finite number of resonances (including\nthe pion) and instead require an infinite number of axial-vector states.

The atmosphere of exoplanets has been studied extensively in recent\nyears, using numerical models to retrieve chemical composition, dynamical\ncirculation or temperature from data. One of the best observational probes in\ntransmission is the sodium doublet, due to its large cross section. However,\nmodelling the shape of the planetary sodium lines has proven to be challenging.\nModels with different assumptions regarding the atmosphere have been employed\nto fit the lines in the literature, yet statistically sound direct comparisons\nof different models are needed to paint a clear picture. Aims. We will compare\ndifferent wind and temperature patterns and provide a tool to distinguish them\ndriven by their best fit for the sodium transmission spectrum of the hot\nJupiter HD 189733b. We parametrise different possible wind patterns already\ntested in literature and introduce the new option of an upwards driven vertical\nwind. Methods. We construct a forward model where the wind speed, wind geometry\nand temperature are injected into the calculation of the transmission spectrum.\nWe embed this forward model in a nested sampling retrieval code to rank the\nmodels via their Bayesian evidence.

We highlight other influences on\nthe width of the doublet and explore strong magnetic fields acting on the lower\natmosphere as one possible origin of the retrieved wind speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 18:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

As a consequence of the critical\nslowing down, its state cannot follow local equilibrium, and its evolution\nbecomes non-adiabatic near the critical point. In the simplest approximation,\nthat stage can be regarded as \"impulse\" where the state of the system remains\nunchanged. It leads to the correct KZM scaling laws. However, such \"freeze-out\"\nmight suggest that the coherence length of the nascent order parameter remains\nunchanged as the critical region is traversed. By contrast, the original\ncausality-based discussion emphasized the role of the {\\it sonic horizon}:\ndomains of the broken symmetry phase can expand with a velocity limited by the\nspeed of the relevant sound. This effect was demonstrated in the quantum Ising\nchain where the dynamical exponent $z=1$ and quasiparticles excited by the\ntransition have a fixed speed of sound. To elucidate the role of the sonic\nhorizon, in this paper we study two systems with $z>1$ where the speed of sound\nis no longer fixed, and the fastest excited quasiparticles set the size of the\nsonic horizon. Their effective speed decays with the increasing transition\ntime. In the extreme case, the dynamical exponent $z$ can diverge such as in\nthe Griffiths region of the random Ising chain where localization of excited\nquasiparticles freezes the growth of the correlation range when the critical\nregion is traversed. Of particular interest is an example with $z<1$ -- the\nlong-range extended Ising chain, where there is no upper limit to the velocity\nof excited quasiparticles with small momenta. Initially, the power-law tail of\nthe correlation function grows adiabatically, but in the non-adiabatic stage it\nlags behind the adiabatic evolution -- in accord with a generalized\nLieb-Robinson bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 18:59:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 19:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-23"}

For an appropriate choice of subsystem symmetry group, we recover known\nfracton phases such as Haah's code, along with new, symmetry-enriched versions\nof these phases, such as non-stabilizer fracton models which are distinct from\nboth the X-cube model and the checkerboard model in the presence of global\ntime-reversal symmetry, as well as a variety of fracton phases enriched by\nspatial symmetries. In $d=2$ dimensions, we find solutions that describe new\nweak and strong SSPT states, such as ones with both line-like subsystem\nsymmetries and global time-reversal symmetry. In $d=1$ dimension, we show that\nany group cohomology solution for a symmetry-protected topological state\nprotected by a global symmetry, along with lattice translational symmetry\nnecessarily satisfies our consistency conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 16:22:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-30"}

Here the impurity parameter, usually a\nfree parameter in cooling simulations, is calculated self-consistently using a\nmicroscopic model for which a unified equation of state has recently been\ndetermined. We follow the evolution of the nuclear distributions of the\nmulti-component Coulomb liquid plasma (MCP) fully self-consistently, adapting a\ngeneral formalism originally developed for the description of supernova cores.\nWe calculate the impurity parameter at the crystallization as determined in the\none-component plasma (OCP) approximation.

The Coulomb coupling parameter at\nmelting is found to be reasonably close to the canonical value of 175, except\nfor specific pressures for which supercooling occurs in the OCP approximation.\nOur MCP treatment leads to non-monotonic variations of the impurity parameter\nwith pressure. Its values can change by several orders of magnitude reaching\nabout 50, suggesting that the crust may be composed of an alternation of pure\n(highly conductive) and impure (highly resistive) layers. The results presented\nhere complement the recent unified equation of state obtained with the same\nmodel.

This paper considers a model in which the\ngood may be offered in two periods; the period in which all consumers most\nvalue the good (period 2), and an earlier period (period 1). Examining the\nprofit-maximizing strategy of the firm under unbounded demand, we find that\neven with no cost of making the product available early, the firm does not\nprofit, and usually loses, by making the product available early.\nInterestingly, the price that maximizes profits induces all arrivals to occur\nearly, or all arrivals to occur late, depending on the parameters. The firm\nwould not set a price which induces consumers to arrive in both periods. In\nparticular, if the firm controls the penalty for arriving early, then it should\nset a high penalty so that no one arrives early. The Nash equilibrium behavior\nof consumers, when deciding if and when to arrive is more complicated than one\nmay suppose, and can generate some unexpected behavior. For example, when there\nis unbounded demand, most potential consumers decide not to arrive at all.\nAdditionally, the arrival rate may decline with the surplus a person gets from\nbuying the good. Surprisingly, we find that an increase in the number of units\nfor sale increases the number of consumers who arrive early. Moreover, we find\nthat the profit-maximizing price increases with the number of units offered for\nsale. This too is unexpected as an increase in supply often results in price\nreduction. In our case, an increase in the number of units on sale also\nincreases demand, and the seller may profit by increasing the price.

Based on these results, we suggest that\nalternative approaches to expected reward maximization have an important role\nto play in training useful autonomous agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 21:13:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 22:15:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

Due to the increasing system scale and complex dependencies inside\nof these networks, system failures can widely spread and cause severe damage.\nWe have experienced massive cascading failures in power grids, such as major\nU.S. western grid failures in 1996 and the great Northeast blackout of 2003.\nTherefore, analyzing cascading failures and defense strategies, in response to\nsystem catastrophic breakdown, is crucial. Although many efforts have been\nperformed to prevent failure propagation throughout systems, optimal system\nrestoration considering system dependency against cascading failures is rarely\nstudied. In this paper, we present a framework to optimize restoration\nstrategies to improve system resiliency regarding cascading failures. The\neffects of restoration strategies are evaluated by system resilience loss\nduring the cascading process. Furthermore, how system dependency influences the\neffects of the system restoration actions against cascading failures are\ninvestigated. By performing a case study on the western U.S. transmission grid,\nwe demonstrate that our framework of system restoration optimization can\nenhance system resiliency by reducing the intensity and extent of cascading\nfailures.

A common tool used to investigate neurocognitive ageing is functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, although fMRI data are often\ninterpreted in terms of neuronal activity, the blood-oxygen-level-dependent\n(BOLD) signal measured by fMRI includes contributions of both vascular and\nneuronal factors, which change differentially with age. While some studies\ninvestigate vascular ageing factors, the results of these studies are not well\nknown within the field of neurocognitive ageing and therefore vascular\nconfounds in neurocognitive fMRI studies are common. In contrast to over 10,000\nBOLD-fMRI papers on ageing, fewer than 20 have applied techniques to correct\nfor vascular effects. However, neurovascular ageing is not only a confound in\nfMRI, but an important feature in its own right, to be assessed alongside\nmeasures of neuronal ageing. We review current approaches to dissociate\nneuronal and vascular components of BOLD-fMRI of regional activity and\nfunctional connectivity. We highlight emerging evidence that vascular\nmechanisms in the brain do not simply control blood flow to support the\nmetabolic needs of neurons, but form complex neurovascular interactions that\ninfluence neuronal function in health and disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 22:03:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 21:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-21"}

Despite\nextensive work and some notable progress, including, for example, the Tango\nTrees (Demaine et al., FOCS 2004), that give the best currently known $O(\\log\n\\log n)$-competitive algorithm, the conjecture remains widely open. One of the\nmain hurdles towards settling the conjecture is that we currently do not have\napproximation algorithms achieving better than an $O(\\log \\log\nn)$-approximation, even in the offline setting. All known non-trivial\nalgorithms for BST's so far rely on comparing the algorithm's cost with the\nso-called Wilber's first bound (WB-1). Therefore, establishing the worst-case\nrelationship between this bound and the optimal solution cost appears crucial\nfor further progress, and it is an interesting open question in its own right.\n  Our contribution is two-fold. First, we show that the gap between the WB-1\nbound and the optimal solution value can be as large as $\\Omega(\\log \\log n/\n\\log \\log \\log n)$; in fact, the gap holds even for several stronger variants\nof the bound. Second, we provide a simple algorithm, that, given an integer\n$D>0$, obtains an $O(D)$-approximation in time $\\exp\\left(O\\left\n(n^{1/2^{\\Omega(D)}}\\log n\\right )\\right )$. In particular, this gives a\nconstant-factor approximation sub-exponential time algorithm. Moreover, we\nobtain a simpler and cleaner efficient $O(\\log \\log n)$-approximation algorithm\nthat can be used in an online setting. Finally, we suggest a new bound, that we\ncall {\\em Guillotine Bound}, that is stronger than WB, while maintaining its\nalgorithm-friendly nature, that we hope will lead to better algorithms. All our\nresults use the geometric interpretation of the problem, leading to cleaner and\nsimpler analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 22:13:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Dec 2019 20:45:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

However, having a population of phantoms that models the variations in\npatient anatomy and, in nuclear medicine, uptake realization is essential for\ncomprehensive validation and training. In this work, we present a novel image\nregistration method for creating highly anatomically detailed anthropomorphic\nphantoms from a single digital phantom. Methods: We propose a\ndeep-learning-based registration algorithm to predict deformation parameters\nfor warping an XCAT phantom to a patient CT scan. This proposed algorithm\noptimizes a novel SSIM-based objective function for a given image pair\nindependently of the training data and thus is truly and fully unsupervised. We\nevaluate the proposed method on a publicly available low-dose CT dataset from\nTCIA. Results: The performance of the proposed model was compared with that of\nseveral state-of-the-art methods, and outperformed them by more than 8%,\nmeasured by the SSIM and less than 30%, by the MSE. Conclusion: A\ndeep-learning-based unsupervised registration method was developed to create\nanthropomorphic phantoms while providing \"gold-standard\" anatomies that can be\nused as the basis for modeling organ properties. Significance: Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The resulting\nanthropomorphic phantom is highly realistic. Combined with realistic\nsimulations of the image formation process, the generated phantoms could serve\nin many applications of medical imaging research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 01:31:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 16:39:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 20:41:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

However, in its straightforward application to\nviscous streaming flows, the equation suffers from severe numerical stiffness\ndue to the wide disparity between the time scales of viscous response,\noscillation period, and slow mean transport, posing a severe challenge for\ndrawing physical insight on mean particle trajectories. In this work, we\ndevelop equations that directly govern the mean transport of particles in\noscillatory viscous flows. The derivation of these equations relies on a\ncombination of three key techniques. In the first, we develop an inertial\nparticle velocity field via a small Stokes number expansion of the particle's\ndeviation from that of the fluid.

Due to these challenges,\ntraditional 3D reconstruction techniques cannot be applied without suitable\nimage pre-processings. One such preprocessing technique is multifocus stacking\nthat combines a set of partially focused images captured from the same viewing\nangle to create a single in-focus image. Traditional multifocus image capture\nuses a camera on a macro rail. Furthermore, the scale and shift are not\nproperly considered by multifocus stacking techniques. As a consequence, the\nresulting in-focus images contain artifacts that violate perspective image\nformation. A 3D reconstruction using such images will fail to produce an\naccurate 3D model of the object.

Unfortunately, there was rarely study of GNN in non-Euclidean\nsettings so far. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we study the GNN with\nattention mechanism in hyperbolic spaces at the first attempt. The research of\nhyperbolic GNN has some unique challenges: since the hyperbolic spaces are not\nvector spaces, the vector operations (e.g., vector addition, subtraction, and\nscalar multiplication) cannot be carried. To tackle this problem, we employ the\ngyrovector spaces, which provide an elegant algebraic formalism for hyperbolic\ngeometry, to transform the features in a graph; and then we propose the\nhyperbolic proximity based attention mechanism to aggregate the features.\nMoreover, as mathematical operations in hyperbolic spaces could be more\ncomplicated than those in Euclidean spaces, we further devise a novel\nacceleration strategy using logarithmic and exponential mappings to improve the\nefficiency of our proposed model.

Most\nof the OH-terminated MXene are metallic, but some of them, e.g. Sc2C(OH)2, are\nsemiconductors and the NFE states are conduction bands. In this paper, to\ninvestigate the NFE states in MXenes, an attractive image-potential well model\nis adopted. Compared the solutions of this model with the DFT calculations, it\nis found that due to the overlap of spatially extensive wave functions of NFE\nstates and their hybridization between the artificial neighboring layers\nimposed by the periodical boundary conditions (PBCs), the DFT results represent\nthe properties of multiple layers, intrinsically. Based on the DFT\ncalculations, it is found that the energy gap widths are affected by the\ninterlayer distances. We address that the energetics of the NFE states can be\nmodulated by the external electric fields and it is possible to convert\nsemiconducting MXenes into metals.

In this paper we claim\nthat these State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) approaches perform reasonably well in\nstructuring information inside a single modality but, despite their impressive\nperformances , they tend to struggle to identify fine-grained inter-modality\nrelationships. Indeed, such relations are frequently assumed to be implicitly\nlearned during training from application-specific losses, mostly cross-entropy\nfor classification. While most recent works provide inductive bias for\ninter-modality relationships via cross attention modules, in this work, we\ndemonstrate (1) that the latter assumption does not hold, i.e. modality\nalignment does not necessarily emerge automatically, and (2) that adding weak\nsupervision for alignment between visual objects and words improves the quality\nof the learned models on tasks requiring reasoning.

The state-of-the-art\nsoftware-only defenses against PeriHammer attacks is to make the exploitable\nhammer rows beyond the attacker's access permission. In this paper, we question\nthe necessity of the above requirement and propose a new class of rowhammer\nattacks, termed as TeleHammer.

In this paper we consider the\nproblem of scheduling a set of tasks subject to precedence constraints on\nhybrid platforms, composed of two types of processing units.

In our view the\ncorrect representations of stored and dissipated energy is essential to the\nrepresentation irreversible material behaviour, and this matching is also used\nfor upscaling. The small scales, here the meso-scale, is assumed to be\ndescribed probabilistically, and so on the macroscale also a probabilistic\nmodel is identified in a Bayesian setting, reflecting the randomness of the\nmeso-scale, the loss of resolution due to upscaling, and the uncertainty\ninvolved in the Bayesian process. In this way multi-scale processes become\nhierarchical systems in which the information is transferred across the scales\nby Bayesian identification on coarser levels. The quantities to be matched on\nthe coarse-scale model are the stored and dissipated energies. In this way\nprobability distributions of macro-scale material parameters are determined,\nand not only in the elastic region, but also for the irreversible and highly\nnonlinear elasto-damage regimes, refelcting the aleatory uncetainty at the\nmeso-scale level. For this purpose high dimensional meso-scale stochastic\nsimulations in a non-intrusive functional approximation forms are mapped to the\nmacro-scale models in an approximative manner by employing a generalised\nversion of the Kalman filter. To reduce the overall computational cost, a model\nreduction of the meso-scale simulation is achieved by combining the\nunsupervised learning techniques based on the Bayesian copula variartional\ninference with the classical functional approximation forms from the field of\nuncertainty quantification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 13:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-09"}

This\npaper presents theoretical foundations to understand the limitations caused by\nignoring the null distribution, and how it can be properly learned from the\n(same) data-set, when possible. We explore this issue in the case where the\nnull distributions are Gaussian with an unknown rescaling parameters (mean and\nvariance) and the alternative distribution is let arbitrary. While an oracle\nprocedure in that case is the Benjamini Hochberg procedure applied with the\ntrue (unknown) null distribution, we pursue the aim of building a procedure\nthat asymptotically mimics the performance of the oracle (AMO in short). Our\nmain result states that an AMO procedure exists if and only if the sparsity\nparameter $k$ (number of false nulls) is of order less than $n/\\log(n)$, where\n$n$ is the total number of tests. Further sparsity boundaries are derived for\ngeneral location models where the shape of the null distribution is not\nnecessarily Gaussian. Given our impossibility results, we also pursue a weaker\nobjective, which is to find a confidence region for the oracle. To this end, we\ndevelop a distribution-dependent confidence region for the null distribution.\nAs practical by-products, this provides a goodness of fit test for the null\ndistribution, as well as a visual method assessing the reliability of empirical\nnull multiple testing methods.

In this framework we cover quantum\nemitters represented by semiconductor quantum dots, colour centres in diamond,\nand defect-/strain-centres in two-dimensional materials. First, we introduce\nthe topic of quantum-light sources and non-classical light generation for\napplications in photonic quantum technologies, motivating the need for the\ndevelopment of scalable device technologies to push the field to real-world\napplications. In the second part, we summarize material systems hosting quantum\nemitters in the solid-state. The third part reviews deterministic fabrication\ntechniques and comparatively discusses their advantages and disadvantages. The\ntechniques are classified in bottom-up approaches, exploiting the\nsite-controlled positioning of the quantum emitters themselves, and top-down\napproaches, allowing for the precise alignment of photonic microstructures to\npre-selected quantum emitters. Special emphasis is put on the progress achieved\nin the development of in-situ techniques, which significantly pushed the\nperformance of quantum-light sources towards applications. Additionally we\ndiscuss hybrid approaches, exploiting pick-and-place techniques or\nwafer-bonding. The fourth part presents state-of-the-art quantum-dot\nquantum-light sources based on the fabrication techniques presented in the\nprevious sections, which feature engineered functionality and enhanced photon\ncollection efficiency. The article closes by highlighting recent applications\nof deterministic solid-state-based quantum-light sources in the fields of\nquantum communication, quantum computing, and quantum metrology, and discussing\nfuture perspectives in the field of solid-state quantum-light sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 14:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-09"}

In order to deal with such a problem,\nFeynman designed a theoretical \"reference amplifier\", thus enabling a\ncharacterization of the distortion by means of a benchmark relationship between\nphase and amplification for each frequency, and providing a standard tool for\ncomparing the operation of real devices. A general theory was elaborated, from\nwhich he was able to deduce the basic features of an amplifier just from its\nresponse to a pulse or to a sine wave of definite frequency. Moreover, in order\nto apply such a theory to practical problems, a couple of remarkable examples\nwere worked out, both for high-frequency cutoff amplifiers and for\nlow-frequency ones. A special consideration deserves a mysteriously exceptional\namplifier with best stability behavior introduced by Feynman, for which\ndifferent physical interpretations are here envisaged.

These resonances are defined as the eigenvalues of the\ngenerator (Kolmogorov operator) of a given stochastic system. By relying on the\ntheory of Markov semigroups, decomposition formulas of correlation functions\nand power spectral densities (PSDs) in terms of RP resonances are then derived.\nThese formulas describe, for a broad class of stochastic differential equations\n(SDEs), how the RP resonances characterize the decay of correlations as well as\nthe signal's oscillatory components manifested by peaks in the PSD.It is then\nshown that a notion reduced RP resonances can be rigorously defined, as soon as\nthe dynamics is partially observed within a reduced state space V . These\nreduced resonances are obtained from the spectral elements of reduced Markov\noperators acting on functions of the state space V , and can be estimated from\nseries. They inform us about the spectral elements of some coarse-grained\nversion of the SDE generator. When the time-lag at which the transitions are\ncollected from partial observations in V , is either sufficiently small or\nlarge, it is shown that the reduced RP resonances approximate the (weak) RP\nresonances of the generator of the conditional expectation in V , i.e. the\noptimal reduced system in V obtained by averaging out the contribution of the\nunobserved variables.

The polydisperse component is subdivided into two\nsub-components and has an average size ten or three times the size of the\nmonodisperse component. We give the set of equations that defines the phase\ndiagram for mixtures with more than two components in a solvent.

This poses challenges in the industry which is undergoing many\nsignificant changes due to new features like connectivity, electrification and\nautomation. Here we focus on automated driving where multiple subsystems, both\nnew and legacy, need to coordinate to realize a safety-critical function. This\npaper introduces a method to support consistent design of an ISO 26262 work\nproduct, the Functional Safety Concept (FSC). The method addresses a need\nwithin the industry for architectural analysis, rationale management and reuse\nof legacy subsystems.

In this work we\nstudy, using coarse-grained Langevin dynamics simulations, the compaction of\npolymers by simple model proteins and a phenomenon known as the\n\"bridging-induced attraction\".

Surrogate models and reduced-order models help to\nestimate aerodynamic fields from a few well-selected simulations. However,\ntheir accuracy dramatically decreases when different physical regimes are\ninvolved. Therefore, a method of local non-intrusive reduced-order models using\nmachine learning, called Local Decomposition Method, has been developed to\nmitigate this issue. This paper introduces several enhancements to this method\nand presents a complex application to an industrial-like three-dimensional\naircraft configuration over a full flight envelope. The enhancements of the\nmethod cover several aspects: choosing the best number of models, estimating\napriori errors, improving the adaptive sampling for parallel issues, and better\nhandling the borders between local models. The application is supported by an\nanalysis of the model behavior, with a focus on the machine learning methods\nand the local properties. The model achieves strong levels of accuracy, in\nparticular with two sub-models: one for the subsonic regime and one for the\ntransonic regime. These results highlight that local models and machine\nlearning represent very promising solutions to deal with surrogate models for\naerodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 14:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

This problem arises from many important\napplications in imaging and signal processing. It is well-known that it is\nimpossible to resolve the sources when they are close enough in practice.\nRayleigh investigated this problem and formulated a resolution limit, the\nso-called Rayleigh limit, for the case of two sources with identical\namplitudes. On the other hand, many numerical experiments demonstrate that a\nstable recovery of the sources is possible even if the sources are separated\nbelow the Rayleigh limit. In this paper, a mathematical theory for the\ndeconvolution problem in one dimension is developed. The theory addresses the\nissue when one can recover the source number exactly from noisy data. The key\nis a new concept \"computational resolution limit\" which is defined to be the\nminimum separation distance between the sources such that exact recovery of the\nsource number is possible.

By applying the constraints for a Schwarzschild black\nhole (BH) and by using the concept of BH effective state, previously introduced\nby one of the authors (CC), the BH quantum gravitational potential, Schrodinger\nequation and the BH energy spectrum are found. Remarkably, such an energy\nspectrum is in agreement (in its absolute value) with the one which was\nconjectured by Bekenstein in 1974 and consistent with other ones in the\nliterature. This approach also permits to find an interesting quantum\nrepresentation of the Schwarzschild BH ground state at the Planck scale.\nMoreover, two fundamental issues about BH quantum physics are addressed by this\nmodel: the area quantization and the singularity resolution. As regards the\nformer, a result similar to the one obtained by Bekenstein, but with a\ndifferent coefficient, has been found. About the latter, it is shown that the\ntraditional classical singularity in the core of the Schwarzschild BH is\nreplaced, in a full quantum treatment, by a two-particle system where the two\ncomponents strongly interact with each other via a quantum gravitational\npotential. The two-particle system seems to be non-singular from the quantum\npoint of view and is analogous to the hydrogen atom because it consists of a\n\"nucleus\" and an \"electron\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 11:17:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 11:34:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 10:20:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 09:29:55 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 14:29:49 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 2 May 2021 10:24:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

So far, only few were shown to be efficient for simple droplets or\nmultiple emulsions production below 5 microns in diameter, which is required to\nprevent microembolism after intravenous injection.

Health issues such as\ncardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases, may have connection with long\nexposure to highly polluted environment. Therefore, accurate air quality\nforecasts are extremely important to those who are vulnerable. To estimate the\nvariation of several air pollution concentrations, previous researchers used\nvarious approaches, such as the Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ)\nor neural networks. Although CMAQ model considers a coverage of the historic\nair pollution data and meteorological variables, extra bias is introduced due\nto additional adjustment. In this paper, a combination of model-based strategy\nand data-driven method namely the physical-temporal collection(PTC) model is\nproposed, aiming to fix the systematic error that traditional models deliver.\nIn the data-driven part, the first components are the temporal pattern and the\nweather pattern to measure important features that contribute to the prediction\nperformance. The less relevant input variables will be removed to eliminate\nnegative weights in network training. Then, we deploy a long-short-term-memory\n(LSTM) to fetch the preliminary results, which will be further corrected by a\nneural network (NN) involving the meteorological index as well as other\npollutants concentrations. The data-set we applied for forecasting is from\nJanuary 1st, 2016 to December 31st, 2016. According to the results, our PTC\nachieves an excellent performance compared with the baseline model (CMAQ\nprediction, GRU, DNN and etc.). This joint model-based data-driven method for\nair quality prediction can be easily deployed on stations without extra\nadjustment, providing results with high-time-resolution information for\nvulnerable members to prevent heavy air pollution ahead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 08:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

The current methods, however,\nhave the following two problems: (1) They can not understand the ambiguous use\nof words in the questions as word usage can strongly depend on the context. As\na result, the accuracies of their answer selections are not good enough. (2)\nThe current methods can only select from among the answers held by QA sites and\ncan not generate new ones. Thus, they can not answer the questions that are\nsomewhat different with those stored in QA sites. Our solution, Neural Answer\nConstruction Model, tackles these problems as it: (1) Incorporates the biases\nof semantics behind questions into word embeddings while also computing them\nregardless of the semantics. As a result, it can extract answers that suit the\ncontexts of words used in the question as well as following the common usage of\nwords across semantics. This improves the accuracy of answer selection. (2)\nUses biLSTM to compute the embeddings of questions as well as those of the\nsentences often used to form answers. It then simultaneously learns the optimum\ncombination of those sentences as well as the closeness between the question\nand those sentences. As a result, our model can construct an answer that\ncorresponds to the situation that underlies the question; it fills the gap\nbetween answer selection and generation and is the first model to move beyond\nthe current simple answer selection model for non-factoid QAs. Evaluations\nusing datasets created for love advice stored in the Japanese QA site, Oshiete\ngoo, indicate that our model achieves 20% higher accuracy in answer creation\nthan the strong baselines. Our model is practical and has already been applied\nto the love advice service in Oshiete goo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 09:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

This methodology avoids confounds\ninherent in conventional measures of predictability, allowing for theoretically\ndeeper accounts of semantic processing. We start from a definition of\nassociations between words based on the significant log likelihood that two\nwords co-occur frequently together in the sentences of a large text corpus.\nDirect associations between stimulus words were controlled, and semantic\nfeature overlap between prime and target words was manipulated by their common\nassociates. The stimuli consisted of sentences of the form pronoun, verb,\narticle, adjective and noun, followed by a series of closed class words, e. g.\n\"She rides the grey elephant on one of her many exploratory voyages\". The\nresults showed that verb-noun overlap reduces single and first fixation\ndurations of the target noun and adjective-noun overlap reduces go-past\ndurations. A dynamic spreading of activation account suggests that associates\nof the prime words take some time to become activated: The verb can act on the\ntarget noun's early eye-movement measures presented three words later, while\nthe adjective is presented immediately prior to the target, which induces\nsentence re-examination after a difficult adjective-noun semantic integration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 09:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}
