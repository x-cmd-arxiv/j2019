We\nfind that the amorphous system is relocated to progressively lower potential\nenergy states during hundreds of cycles, and the energy levels become deeper\nupon approaching critical strain amplitude from below. The decrease in\npotential energy is associated with collective nonaffine rearrangements of\natoms, and their rescaled probability distribution becomes independent of the\ncycle number at sufficiently large time intervals. It is also shown that\nyielding during startup shear deformation occurs at larger values of the stress\novershoot in samples that were cyclically loaded at higher strain amplitudes.\nThese results might be useful for mechanical processing of amorphous alloys in\norder to reduce their energy and increase chemical resistivity and resistance\nto crystallization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 2019 16:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-04"}

In this manuscript,\nwe generalize the PT model as a collection of point particles arranged in a\ncircle of radius $R$. The resulting ``rigid body'' is driven in a composite\nforce field by a moving spring (of stiffness $k$) connected to the center of\nmass of the rigid body in presence of damping. The force field is a product of\nthe familiar sinusoidal function used in the PT model with a parametrically\ncontrolled ($\\lambda$) exponentially varying function that is dependent on the\nvertical coordinates of the particles.

The model describes a compactification of 6-dimensional\nsupergravity with a monopole background on a 2-sphere. In 4 dimensions, there\nare 2 scalar fields, $X$ and $Y $, and the effective potential in the Einstein\nframe is an exponential with respect to $Y$ times a quadratic polynomial in the\nfield $e^{-X}$. When making the volume of the 2-sphere large, namely for large\nvalues of $Y$, there appears a tower of states, which according to the infinite\ndistance swampland conjecture becomes exponentially massless. If the standard\nmodel fields are confined on Neveu-Schwarz 5-branes the 6-dimensional gauge\ncouplings are independent of the string dilaton in the string frame, and upon\ncompactification to 4 dimensions the 4-dimensional gauge couplings depend on\n$X$ (rather than the dilaton $Y$) which is fixed at the minimum of the\npotential. This avoids direct couplings of the dilaton to matter suppressing\nextra forces competing with gravity.

To overcome this limitation, we\nuse a recently proposed approach based on the angular moments of the\nenergy-integrated electron lepton-number distribution. With this method we find\nthe possibility of fast neutrino flavor instability at radii <~20 km, which is\nwell interior to the neutrinosphere. Our results confirm recent observations in\na 2D SN model and in 2D/3D models with fixed matter background, which were\ncomputed with Boltzmann neutrino transport. However, the flavor unstable\nlocations are not isolated points as discussed previously, but thin skins\nsurrounding volumes where electron antineutrinos are more abundant than\nelectron neutrinos. These volumes grow with time and appear first in the\nconvective layer of the proto-neutron star (PNS), where a decreasing electron\nfraction (Ye) and high temperatures favor the occurrence of regions with\nnegative neutrino chemical potential. Since Ye remains higher in the LESA\ndipole direction, where convective lepton-number transport out from the\nnonconvective PNS core slows down the deleptonization, flavor unstable\nconditions become more widespread in the opposite hemisphere. This interesting\nphenomenon deserves further investigation, since its impact on SN modeling and\npossible consequences for SN dynamics and neutrino observations are presently\nunclear.

Recently, deep learning techniques have been\napplied to the challenging task of EMG-based gesture recognition. The adoption\nof these techniques slowly shifts the focus from feature engineering to feature\nlearning. However, the black-box nature of deep learning makes it hard to\nunderstand the type of information learned by the network and how it relates to\nhandcrafted features. Additionally, due to the high variability in EMG\nrecordings between participants, deep features tend to generalize poorly across\nsubjects using standard training methods. Consequently, this work introduces a\nnew multi-domain learning algorithm, named ADANN, which significantly enhances\n(p=0.00004) inter-subject classification accuracy by an average of 19.40%\ncompared to standard training. Using ADANN-generated features, the main\ncontribution of this work is to provide the first topological data analysis of\nEMG-based gesture recognition for the characterisation of the information\nencoded within a deep network, using handcrafted features as landmarks. This\nanalysis reveals that handcrafted features and the learned features (in the\nearlier layers) both try to discriminate between all gestures, but do not\nencode the same information to do so. Furthermore, using convolutional network\nvisualization techniques reveal that learned features tend to ignore the most\nactivated channel during gesture contraction, which is in stark contrast with\nthe prevalence of handcrafted features designed to capture amplitude\ninformation. Overall, this work paves the way for hybrid feature sets by\nproviding a clear guideline of complementary information encoded within learned\nand handcrafted features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 2019 23:11:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 17:37:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-23"}

To\ncircumvent this difficulty, one major school of thought to approach networks\nusing machine learning is via network embeddings.

However, most socially interactive\nrobots do not need to physically interact with their environments in order to\nperform their tasks. When and why should embodied robots be used instead of\nsimpler and cheaper virtual agents? This paper reviews the existing work that\nexplores the role of physical embodiment in socially interactive robots. This\nclass consists of robots that are not only capable of engaging in social\ninteraction with humans, but are using primarily their social capabilities to\nperform their desired functions. Socially interactive robots provide\nentertainment, information, and/or assistance; this last category is typically\nencompassed by socially assistive robotics. In all cases, such robots can\nachieve their primary functions without performing functional physical work. To\ncomprehensively evaluate the existing body of work on embodiment, we first\nreview work from established related fields including psychology, philosophy,\nand sociology. We then systematically review 65 studies evaluating aspects of\nembodiment published from 2003 to 2017 in major peer-reviewed robotics\npublication venues. We examine relevant aspects of the selected studies,\nfocusing on the embodiments compared, tasks evaluated, social roles of robots,\nand measurements. We introduce three taxonomies for the types of robot\nembodiment, robot social roles, and human-robot tasks. These taxonomies are\nused to deconstruct the design and interaction spaces of socially interactive\nrobots and facilitate analysis and discussion of the reviewed studies. We use\nthis newly-defined methodology to critically discuss existing works, revealing\ntopics within embodiment research for social interaction, assistive robotics,\nand service robotics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2019 03:58:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

Moreover, the kinetic pressure ahead of the\nintruder decays exponentially in the co-moving system of the intruder. Its\nscaling gives rise to a characteristic length scale, which is in the order of\nintruder size. This finding is in perfect agreement with the long-scale\ninertial dissipation type that we find in all cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2019 06:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

This is possible thanks to the existence in non algebraically closed\nfields of many normic forms, i.e. homogeneous polynomials with no non-trivial\nzero rational in $k$, and relies on an equiresidual generalisation of Hilbert's\nNullstellensatz and the Jacobson radical in finitely presented $k$-algebras.\nUsual algebraic constructions are naturally worked out using a new type of\n$k$-algebras which correspond to localisations of $k$-algebras by means of\npolynomials over $k$ with no inner zero. The theory leads to a fruitful\ncharacterisation of the sections of sheaves of regular functions over affine\nalgebraic sets, providing a dualisation of the (equiresidual) affine algebraic\nvarieties over $k$ by an equiresidual analogue of reduced algebras of finite\ntype. The true generalisation of reduced algebras are defined using the normic\nforms and encompass all rings of rational functions over affine subvarieties.\nThese \"special\" algebras are interpreted as giving rise to a \"special\" radical,\nan equiresidual version of the classic radical of an ideal, of which we give a\nclean algebraic characterisation. Special extensions are the \"right\" field\nextensions of the ground field in EQAG and provide a connexion with\nmodel-theoretic algebraic geometry, as exemplified with real closed fields and\np-adically closed fields. The special radical is well-behaved with respect to\nlocalisation, and this leads to an equiresidual analogue of the prime spectrum,\nwhich connects affine EQAG with scheme theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2019 07:51:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 10:41:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2022 08:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

The degrees of freedom of the sparse array is enhanced by\nsparse sampling property. In this respect, V-shaped coprime (VCA) and V-shaped\nnested array (VNA) structures are developed.

We\nperform an independent analysis of the publicly available data and investigate\nthe physical implications of this potential association. By carefully studying\nthe following properties of GBM-190816 using Fermi/GBM data, including\nsignal-to-noise ratio, duration, f-parameter, spectral properties, energetic\nproperties, and its compliance with some GRB statistical correlations, we\nconfirm that this event is likely a typical short GRB. Assuming its association\nwith the sub-threshold GW event, the inferred luminosity is\n$1.47_{-1.04}^{+3.40} \\times 10^{49}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Based on the available\ninformation of the sub-threshold GW event, we infer the mass ratio q of the\ncompact binary as $q=2.26_{-1.43}^{+2.75}$ according to the reported range of\nluminosity distance. If the heavier compact object has a mass > 3 solar masses,\nq can be further constrained to $q=2.26_{-0.12}^{+2.75}$.

In the decoupling limit the effective field theory (EFT)\ndescribing perturbations around the stealth Minkowski (or de Sitter) solution\nshows the universal dispersion relation of the form $\\omega^2 = \\alpha\nk^4/M^2$, where $M$ is a mass scale characterizing the background scalar field\nand $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless constant.

For example, free movement of head pose may cause large rotation\ndifference between iris images. And illumination variations may cause irregular\ndistortion of iris texture. To match intra-class iris images with head rotation\nrobustly, the existing solutions usually need a precise alignment operation by\nexhaustive search within a determined range in iris image preprosessing or\nbrute force searching the minimum Hamming distance in iris feature matching. In\nthe wild, iris rotation is of much greater uncertainty than that in constrained\nsituations and exhaustive search within a determined range is impracticable.\nThis paper presents a unified feature-level solution to both alignment free and\ndistortion robust iris recognition in the wild. A new deep learning based\nmethod named Alignment Free Iris Network (AFINet) is proposed, which uses a\ntrainable VLAD (Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors) encoder called\nNetVLAD to decouple the correlations between local representations and their\nspatial positions. And deformable convolution is used to overcome iris texture\ndistortion by dense adaptive sampling. The results of extensive experiments on\nthree public iris image databases and the simulated degradation databases show\nthat AFINet significantly outperforms state-of-art iris recognition methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2019 11:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

Unlike most existing related works, the Nash equilibrium in this\nwork is defined by functions of agent outputs instead of full agent states,\nwhich allows the agents to have more general and heterogeneous dynamics and\nmaintain some privacy of their local states. The concerned network game is\nformulated with agents modeled by uncertain linear systems subject to external\ndisturbances. The cost function of each agent is a linear quadratic function\ndepending on the outputs of its own and its neighbors in the underlying graph.\nThe main challenge stemming from this game formulation is that merely driving\nthe agent outputs to the Nash equilibrium does not guarantee the stability of\nthe agent dynamics. Using local output and the outputs from the neighbors of\neach agent, we aim at designing game strategies that achieve output Nash\nequilibrium seeking and stabilization of the closed-loop dynamics.\nParticularly, when each agents knows how the actions of its neighbors affect\nits cost function, a game strategy is developed for network games with digraph\ntopology. When each agent is also allowed to exchange part of its compensator\nstate, a distributed strategy can be designed for networks with connected\nundirected graphs or connected digraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2019 11:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

The approach\nis based on the concept of optimal parameterizing manifold (PM) that\nsubstitutes the more classical notion of slow manifold or invariant manifold\nwhen breakdown of slaving occurs. An optimal PM provides the manifold that\ndescribes the average motion of the neglected scales as a function of the\nresolved scales and allows, in principle, for determining the best vector field\nof the reduced state space that describes e.g. the dynamics' slow motion. The\nunderlying optimal parameterizations are approximated by dynamically-based\nformulas derived analytically from the original equations. These formulas are\ncontingent upon the determination of only a few (scalar) parameters obtained\nfrom minimization of cost functionals, depending on training dataset collected\nfrom direct numerical simulation. In practice, a training period of length\ncomparable to a characteristic recurrence or decorrelation time of the\ndynamics, is sufficient for the efficient derivation of optimized\nparameterizations. Applications to the closure of low-order models of\nAtmospheric Primitive Equations and Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection are then\ndiscussed.

For a rapidly rotating magnetar central engine, the\ndeposition of the rotation energy into the ejecta launched from the merger\ncould lead to bright radio emission. The brightness of radio emission years\nafter an SGRB would provide an estimation of the kinetic energy of ejecta and\nhence, a possible constraint on the BNS merger product.

Such materials are made of a continuous\nfat phase in which solid particles are dispersed. Phenomena such as yield and\nfracture occur in those materials and depend heavily on the composition of the\nsamples. The crystallization of fat is altered in presence of particle, which\nleads to products with different physical properties. However, because of the\nvery complex aspect of the problem, very few studies have been trying to\ncharacterize the influence of the solid particles on the final product. Small\namplitude oscillatory rheology is often used to characterize the stiffness of\nthe materials. But processed products might not meet the desired shape\nnecessary to perform rheology experiment, which require a very specific product\nshape that might not be easily achievable when it comes to industrial trials.\nOscillatory rheology is therefore not always the best option to measure the\nphysical properties of hard fat mixes. In this paper, we formulate binary mixes\nconsisting of a hard fat matrix in which we added solid inclusions of sodium\nchloride. We create various set of samples with different salt and fat volume\nfraction and let them crystallize for a few weeks. We then perform various\nmicro indentation protocols on the resulting samples. We then elaborate a small\nrheology model that is in accord with the data, and is able to predict the\nsmall deformation of heterogeneous materials indented by various shapes and\nloading protocols. We derive various physical quantities from this model such\nas the storage and loss moduli. We conclude by stating that the complex modulus\nof the binary mix grows with the solid volume fraction, following the classical\nKrieger Dougherty empirical law (similarly to suspensions), to finally diverge\nat a given volume fraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2019 14:44:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

The unit\ncell of such lattices consists of a sub-lattice of the face cubic-centered unit\ncell typically analyzed in the current literature on pentamode materials. The\nstudied systems exhibit only three soft deformation modes in the infinitesimal\nstretch-dominated regime, as opposed to the five zero-energy modes of\nunconfined pentamode lattices. We develop analytical formulae for the vertical\nand bending stiffness properties and study the dependence of such quantities on\nthe main design parameters: the lattice constant, the solid volume fraction,\nthe cross-section area of the rods, and the layer thickness. A noteworthy\nresult is that the effective compression modulus of the analyzed structures is\nequal to two thirds of the Young modulus of the stiffest isotropic elastic\nnetworks currently available in the literature, being accompanied by\nzero-rigidity against infinitesimal shear and twisting mechanisms. The use of\nthe proposed metamaterials as novel seismic-isolation devices and\nimpact-protection equipment is discussed by drawing comparisons with the\nresponse of alternative devices already available or under development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 2019 23:21:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}
