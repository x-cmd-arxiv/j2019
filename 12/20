The first\ninvestigations concerned single photons, squeezed states, twin beams and EPR\nstates, that involve only one or two modes of the electromagnetic field. The\nstudy of the properties of quantum light then evolved in the direction of more\nand more complex and rich situations, involving many modes, either spatial,\ntemporal, frequency, or polarization modes. Actually, each mode of the\nelectromagnetic field can be considered as an individual quantum degree of\nfreedom. It is then possible, using the techniques of nonlinear optics, to\ncouple different modes, and thus to build in a controlled way a quantum network\nin which the nodes are optical modes and that is endowed with a strong\nmultipartite entanglement. In addition, such networks are easily reconfigurable\nand subject only to weak decoherence. They open indeed many promising\nperspectives for optical communications and computation.\n  Because of the linearity of Maxwell equations a linear superposition of two\nmodes is another mode. This means that a \"modal superposition principle\" exists\nhand in hand with the regular quantum state superposition principle. The\npurpose of the present review is to show the interest of considering these two\naspects of multimode quantum light in a global way. Indeed using different sets\nof modes allows to consider the same quantum state under different\nperspectives: a given state can be entangled in one basis, factorized in\nanother. We will show how to produce, characterize and tailor multimode quantum\nlight. Finally we will describe some applications to quantum technologies, such\nas parameter estimation and measurement-based quantum computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 16:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

Such methods are based on\nthe assumption of separability of normal and anomalous classes, and\nsubsequently do not take into account any available samples of anomalies.\nNonetheless, in practical settings, some anomalous samples are often available;\nhowever, usually in amounts far lower than required for a balanced\nclassification task, and the separability assumption might not always hold.\nThis leads to an important task -- incorporating known anomalous samples into\ntraining procedures of anomaly detection models.\n  In this work, we propose a novel model-agnostic training procedure to address\nthis task. We reformulate one-class classification as a binary classification\nproblem with normal data being distinguished from pseudo-anomalous samples. The\npseudo-anomalous samples are drawn from low-density regions of a normalizing\nflow model by feeding tails of the latent distribution into the model.

The\nresulting networks perform all computations in low-precision, without requiring\nhigher-precision BN and nonlinearities, while still being highly accurate. To\nachieve this result, we employ a novel quantization technique that learns to\noptimally quantize the weights and activations of the network during training.\nAdditionally, to enhance training convergence we use a new training technique,\ncalled gradual quantization. We leverage the nonlinear and normalizing behavior\nof our quantization function to effectively remove the higher-precision\nnonlinearities and BN from the network. The resulting convolutional layers are\nfully quantized to low precision, from input to output, ideal for neural\nnetwork accelerators on the edge.

Recently, Deep Learning methods using iterative neural networks\nand cascaded neural networks have been reported to achieve state-of-the-art\nresults with respect to various quantitative quality measures as PSNR, NRMSE\nand SSIM across different imaging modalities. However, the fact that these\napproaches employ the forward and adjoint operators repeatedly in the network\narchitecture requires the network to process the whole images or volumes at\nonce, which for some applications is computationally infeasible. In this work,\nwe follow a different reconstruction strategy by decoupling the regularization\nof the solution from ensuring consistency with the measured data. The\nregularization is given in the form of an image prior obtained by the output of\na previously trained neural network which is used in a Tikhonov regularization\nframework. By doing so, more complex and sophisticated network architectures\ncan be used for the removal of the artefacts or noise than it is usually the\ncase in iterative networks. Due to the large scale of the considered problems\nand the resulting computational complexity of the employed networks, the priors\nare obtained by processing the images or volumes as patches or slices.

In particular, we focus on\noptically-pumped DMs which have been theoretically proposed as a promising\nplatform for observation of a transient excitonic instability.\n  Optical pumping combined with the linear (Dirac) dispersion of the electronic\nspectrum offers a knob for tuning the effective interaction between the\nphotoexcited electrons and holes, and thus provides a way of reducing the\ncritical coupling for excitonic instability. As a result, a transient excitonic\ncondensate could be achieved in a pumped DM while it is not feasible in\nequilibrium. We provide a unifying theoretical framework for describing\ntransient collective states in two- and three-dimensional DMs. We describe\nexperimental signatures of the transient excitonic state and summarize\nnumerical estimates of the magnitude of the effect, namely the size of the\ndynamically-induced excitonic gaps and the values of the critical temperatures\nfor several specific systems.

This new form of the metric\nreveals that the two settings differ only at the level of the gravitomagnetic\nvector potential which, for a rotating cylinder, cannot be eliminated by any\nglobal coordinate transformation.

The classical\ndynamics arising from the quantum dynamics of the angular momentum expectation\nvalues are derived. The presence of PT-symmetry can lead to stable mixed\nregular chaotic behaviour without sinks or sources for subcritical values of\nthe gain-loss parameter. This is an example of what is known in classical\ndynamical systems as reversible dynamical systems. For large values of the\nkicking strength a strange attractor is observed that also persists if\nPT-symmetry is broken. The intensity dynamics of the classical map is found to\nprovide the main structure for the Husimi distributions of the subspaces of the\nquantum system belonging to certain ranges of the imaginary parts of the\nquasienergies. Classical structures are identified in the quantum dynamics.\nFinally, the statistics of the eigenvalues of the quantum system are analysed\nand it is shown that if most of the eigenvalues are complex (which is the case\nalready for fairly small non-Hermiticity parameters) the nearest-neighbour\ndistances of the (unfolded) quasienergies follow a two-dimensional Posisson\ndistribution when the classical dynamics is regular. In the chaotic regime,\nthey are in line with recently identified universal complex level spacing\ndistributions for non-Hermitian systems, with transpose symmetry $A^T= A$. It\nis demonstrated how breaking this symmetry (by introducing an extra term in the\nHamiltonian) recovers the more familiar universality class for non-Hermitian\nsystems given by the complex Ginibre ensemble. Both universality classes\ndisplay cubic level repulsion. The PT-symmetry of the system does not seem to\ninfluence the complex level spacings.

Despite their long history, variants with remarkable\nfunctionalities continue to be discovered. Further advances could exploit\nFourier optics, which specifies the surface pattern that generates a desired\ndiffracted output through its Fourier transform. To shape the optical\nwavefront, the ideal surface profile should contain a precise sum of sinusoidal\nwaves, each with a well-defined amplitude, spatial frequency, and phase.\nHowever, because fabrication techniques typically yield profiles with at most a\nfew depth levels, complex 'wavy' surfaces cannot be obtained, limiting the\nstraightforward mathematical design and implementation of sophisticated\ndiffractive optics.

If this rate is due to a putative interaction with\ngravitons, the black hole at this timescale can be expected to be Planck-sized,\nbut notably without an extensive amount of information packed inside. We\njustify our findings by numerically studying a toy model of stabilizer circuits\nthat can efficiently model black hole evaporation in the presence of\ndecoherence.

Realizing this potential requires automated approaches to optimize\nestimates of stellar properties, such as chemical element abundances, from the\nspectra. The volume and quality of the observations strongly motivate that\nthese approaches should be data-driven. With this in mind, we introduce\nSSSpaNG: a data-driven non-Gaussian Process model of stellar spectra. We\ndemonstrate the capabilities of SSSpaNG using a sample of APOGEE red clump\nstars, whose model parameters we infer via Gibbs sampling. Pooling information\nbetween stars to infer their covariance, we permit clear identification of the\ncorrelations between spectral pixels. Harnessing these correlations, we infer\nthe true spectrum of each star, inpainting missing regions and denoising by a\nfactor of at least 2 for stars with signal-to-noise of ~20. As we marginalize\nover the covariance matrix of the spectra, the effective prior on these true\nspectra is non-Gaussian and sparsifying, favouring typically small but\noccasionally large excursions from the mean. The high-fidelity inferred spectra\nproduced will enable improved elemental abundance measurements for individual\nstars. Our model also allows us to quantify the information gained by observing\nportions of a star's spectrum, and thereby define the most mutually informative\nspectral regions. Using 25 windows centred on elemental absorption lines, we\ndemonstrate that the iron-peak and alpha-process elements are particularly\nmutually informative for these spectra, and that the majority of information\nabout a target window is contained in the 10-or-so most informative windows.\nSuch mutual-information estimates have the potential to inform models of\nnucleosynthetic yields and the design of future observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 19:06:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 09:12:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

Recently, parties on both sides of the 'legal\naisle' are accepting the use of machine learning techniques like text\nclassification to cull massive volumes of data and to identify responsive\ndocuments for use in these matters. While text classification is regularly used\nto reduce the discovery costs in legal matters, it also faces a peculiar\nperception challenge: amongst lawyers, this technology is sometimes looked upon\nas a \"black box\", little information provided for attorneys to understand why\ndocuments are classified as responsive. In recent years, a group of AI and ML\nresearchers have been actively researching Explainable AI, in which actions or\ndecisions are human understandable. In legal document review scenarios, a\ndocument can be identified as responsive, if one or more of its text snippets\nare deemed responsive. In these scenarios, if text classification can be used\nto locate these snippets, then attorneys could easily evaluate the model's\nclassification decision. When deployed with defined and explainable results,\ntext classification can drastically enhance overall quality and speed of the\nreview process by reducing the review time. Moreover, explainable predictive\ncoding provides lawyers with greater confidence in the results of that\nsupervised learning task. This paper describes a framework for explainable text\nclassification as a valuable tool in legal services: for enhancing the quality\nand efficiency of legal document review and for assisting in locating\nresponsive snippets within responsive documents.

However, large-scale edge computing networks can\nsuffer substantially from unpredictable and unreliable computing resources\nwhich can result in high variability of service quality. Thus, it is crucial to\ndesign efficient task scheduling policies that guarantee quality of service and\nthe timeliness of computation queries. In this paper, we study the problem of\ncomputation offloading over unknown edge cloud networks with a sequence of\ntimely computation jobs. Motivated by the MapReduce computation paradigm, we\nassume each computation job can be partitioned to smaller Map functions that\nare processed at the edge, and the Reduce function is computed at the user\nafter the Map results are collected from the edge nodes. We model the service\nquality (success probability of returning result back to the user within\ndeadline) of each edge device as function of context (collection of factors\nthat affect edge devices).

Together with the evidence for broken\ntime-reversal symmetry and a jump in the shear modulus $c_{66}$ at the\nsuperconducting transition temperature, the available experiments point towards\nan even-parity chiral superconductor with $k_z(k_x\\pm ik_y)$-like $E_g$\nsymmetry, which has consistently been dismissed based on the\nquasi-two-dimensional electronic structure of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Here, we show how\nthe orbital degree of freedom can encode the two-component nature of the $E_g$\norder parameter, allowing for a local orbital-antisymmetric spin-triplet state\nthat can be stabilized by on-site Hund's coupling.

In recent years, many vision-based techniques have been\nproposed to detect power lines to facilitate self-driving UAVs and automatic\nobstacle avoidance. However, most of the proposed methods are typically based\non a common three-step approach: (i) edge detection, (ii) the Hough transform,\nand (iii) spurious line elimination based on power line constrains. These\napproaches not only are slow and inaccurate but also require a huge amount of\neffort in post-processing to distinguish between power lines and spurious\nlines. In this paper, we introduce LS-Net, a fast single-shot line-segment\ndetector, and apply it to power line detection. The LS-Net is by design fully\nconvolutional and consists of three modules: (i) a fully convolutional feature\nextractor, (ii) a classifier, and (iii) a line segment regressor. Due to the\nunavailability of large datasets with annotations of power lines, we render\nsynthetic images of power lines using the Physically Based Rendering (PBR)\napproach and propose a series of effective data augmentation techniques to\ngenerate more training data. With a customized version of the VGG-16 network as\nthe backbone, the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art\napproaches. In addition, the LS-Net can detect power lines in near real-time\n(20.4 FPS).

While current verification methods mainly\nfocus on the $\\ell_p$-norm threat model of the input instances, robustness\nverification against semantic adversarial attacks inducing large $\\ell_p$-norm\nperturbations, such as color shifting and lighting adjustment, are beyond their\ncapacity. To bridge this gap, we propose \\textit{Semantify-NN}, a\nmodel-agnostic and generic robustness verification approach against semantic\nperturbations for neural networks. By simply inserting our proposed\n\\textit{semantic perturbation layers} (SP-layers) to the input layer of any\ngiven model, \\textit{Semantify-NN} is model-agnostic, and any $\\ell_p$-norm\nbased verification tools can be used to verify the model robustness against\nsemantic perturbations.

Especially important\nfor the fields of spectroscopy and interferometry is that it enables the\nprospect to couple light into single-mode fibers (SMFs). However, due to their\nsmall size, efficient coupling is very sensitive to the quality of the fiber\nalignment, beam drifts and higher-frequency tip-tilt aberrations caused by\ntelescope mechanics and vibrations. These residual aberrations are not always\nsensed and corrected by the AO system, leading to unacceptable losses. This is\nparticularly severe for the Extremely Large Telescopes, where their huge\nstructure will mean vibrations increase and optimal AO solutions are even more\ndifficult to implement. We have created a focal plane sensor to correct for\nresidual aberrations by surrounding the SMF with six Multi-mode fibers (MMFs).\nOn each of the MMFs sits a printed freeform lens, making up a six-element\nmicro-lens ring to refract the light into these surrounding MMFs and thus\nminimizing light loss in the gap between the fiber cores. This means when the\nbeam is near diffraction limited and centered almost all light couples to the\nSMF. When the beam is misaligned, it couples to the surrounding cores, which\nare read out by a detector and processed by the DARC software driving a\ntip-tilt mirror. Currently we are aiming to detect and correct only tip-tilt\naberrations.

The CKM matrix\nparametrizes the weak charged current interactions of quarks in the Standard\nModel (SM), and a precise determination of its elements has always been one of\nthe most important targets of particle physics. The precise knowledge of the\n$|V_{cb}|$ value plays a pivotal role in testing the flavour sector of the SM\nand in the analyses of the unitarity of the CKM matrix. The SM does not predict\nthe values of the CKM matrix elements, which have to be extracted by\nexperimental data. Given the variety of channels that allow the extraction of\n$|V_{cb}|$, different theoretical and experimental techniques are mustered for\nthe $|V_{cb}|$ determination. The exertion toward precision represents not only\na significant test of our theoretical procedures but a stimulus towards better\ndetection performances. The most precise measurements of $|V_{cb}|$ come from\nsemileptonic decays, that being tree level at the lowest order in the SM are\ngenerally considered unaffected by physics beyond the SM.\n  After summarizing the characteristics of the SM that set the frame for the\ndetermination of $|V_{cb}|$, we discuss inclusive and exclusive semileptonic\n$B$ decays.

The expansion is\nperformed by means of moments around the MBB law, related to derivatives with\nrespect to the dust spectral index.

The comparison with simulations helps us to disentangle\nthe respective contributions from dust and the cosmic infrared background to\nthe high-order moments, but the simulations give an insufficient description of\nthe actual Planck data. Extending our model to cosmic microwave background\nB-mode analyses within a simplified framework, we find that ignoring the dust\nSED distortions, or trying to model them with a single decorrelation parameter,\ncould lead to biases that are larger than the targeted sensitivity for the next\ngeneration of CMB B-mode experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 22:07:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 14:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-12"}

To date, virtually all works\nin the literature have used either shape-based classification using a distance\nmeasure or feature-based classification after finding some suitable features\nfor the domain. It seems to be underappreciated that in many datasets it is the\ncase that some classes are best discriminated with features, while others are\nbest discriminated with shape. Thus, making the shape vs. feature choice will\ncondemn us to poor results, at least for some classes. In this work, we propose\na new model for classifying time series that allows the use of both shape and\nfeature-based measures, when warranted. Our algorithm automatically decides\nwhich approach is best for which class, and at query time chooses which\nclassifier to trust the most.

In this paper, we propose coarse-to-fine neural\narchitecture search (C2FNAS) to automatically search a 3D segmentation network\nfrom scratch without inconsistency on network size or input size.

The coarse-to-fine manner divides the search procedure into two\nconsecutive stages and meanwhile resolves the inconsistency.

In the density map, each person\nis represented by a Gaussian blob, and the final count is obtained from the\nintegration of the whole map. However, it is difficult to accurately predict\nthe density map on dense regions. A major issue is that the density map on\ndense regions usually accumulates density values from a number of nearby\nGaussian blobs, yielding different large density values on a small set of\npixels. This makes the density map present variant patterns with significant\npattern shifts and brings a long-tailed distribution of pixel-wise density\nvalues. We propose a simple and effective Learning to Scale (L2S) module, which\nautomatically scales dense regions into reasonable closeness levels (reflecting\nimage-plane distance between neighboring people). L2S directly normalizes the\ncloseness in different patches such that it dynamically separates the\noverlapped blobs, decomposes the accumulated values in the ground-truth density\nmap, and thus alleviates the pattern shifts and long-tailed distribution of\ndensity values. This helps the model to better learn the density map. We also\nexplore the effectiveness of L2S in localizing people by finding the local\nminima of the quantized distance (w.r.t. person location map). To the best of\nour knowledge, such a localization method is also novel in localization-based\ncrowd counting. We further introduce a customized dynamic cross-entropy loss,\nsignificantly improving the localization-based model optimization.

These states arise from valley\nferromagnetism, and the complete filling of Chern bands. A natural question is\nwhether fractional filling of the same bands would lead to fractional quantum\nHall states, i.e. to fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Here, we argue that\nthe magic angle graphene bands have favorable quantum geometry for realizing\nFCI phases. We show that in the tractable `chiral' limit, the flat bands\nwavefunctions are an analytic function of the crystal momentum. This remarkable\nproperty fixes the quantum metric up to an overall momentum dependent scale\nfactor, the local Berry curvature, whose variation is itself small. Thus the\nthree conditions associated with FCI stability (i) narrow bands (ii) quantum\nmetric satisfying the isotropic ideal droplet condition and (iii) relatively\nuniform Berry curvature are all satisfied. Our work emphasizes continuum real\nspace approaches to FCIs in contrast to earlier works which mostly focused on\ntight binding models. This enables us to construct a Laughlin wavefunction on a\nreal-space torus that is a zero energy ground state of pseudopotential-like\ninteractions.

Code review has been widely used for both\nindustry and open-source projects due to its capacity in early defect\nidentification, project maintenance, and code improvement. With rapid updates\non project developments, code review becomes a non-trivial and labor-intensive\ntask for reviewers. Thus, an automated code review engine can be beneficial and\nuseful for project development in practice. Although there exist prior studies\non automating the code review process by adopting static analysis tools or deep\nlearning techniques, they often require external sources such as partial or\nfull source code for accurate review suggestion. In this paper, we aim at\nautomating the code review process only based on code changes and the\ncorresponding reviews but with better performance. The hinge of accurate code\nreview suggestion is to learn good representations for both code changes and\nreviews. To achieve this with limited source, we design a multi-level embedding\n(i.e., word embedding and character embedding) approach to represent the\nsemantics provided by code changes and reviews. The embeddings are then well\ntrained through a proposed attentional deep learning model, as a whole named\nCORE. We evaluate the effectiveness of CORE on code changes and reviews\ncollected from 19 popular Java projects hosted on Github. Experimental results\nshow that our model CORE can achieve significantly better performance than the\nstate-of-the-art model (DeepMem), with an increase of 131.03% in terms of\nRecall@10 and 150.69% in terms of Mean Reciprocal Rank.

Among these are the cusp-core problem and the\nabundance of small structures of the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. In\nthis paper we show that multi-state solutions of the low energy and weak\ngravitational field limit of field equations, interpreted as galactic halo\ndensity profiles, can provide a possible explanation to the anisotropic\ndistribution of satellite galaxies observed in the Milky Way, M31 and Centaurus\nA, where satellites trajectories seem to concentrate on planes close to the\npoles of the galaxies instead of following homogeneously distributed\ntrajectories. The core hypothesis is that multi-state solutions of the\nequations describing the dynamics of this dark matter candidate, namely, the\nGross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations, with monopolar and dipolar contributions,\ncan possibly explain the anisotropy of satellite trajectories. In order to\nconstruct a proof of concept, we study the trajectories of a number of test\nparticles traveling on top of the gravitational potential due to a multi-state\nhalo with modes (1,0,0)+(2,1,0). The result is that particles accumulate\nasymptotically in time on planes passing close to the poles. Satellite galaxies\nare not test particles but interpreted as such, our results indicate that in\nthe asymptotic time their trajectories do not distribute isotropically, instead\nthey prefer to have orbital poles accumulating near the equatorial plane of the\nmultistate halo.

Consequently, the discriminator is extremely\nvulnerable to adversarial perturbation and the gradient given by the\ndiscriminator contains non-informative adversarial noises, which hinders the\ngenerator from catching the pattern of real samples. Here, we develop\nadversarial symmetric GANs (AS-GANs) that incorporate adversarial training of\nthe discriminator on real samples into vanilla GANs, making adversarial\ntraining symmetrical. The discriminator is therefore more robust and provides\nmore informative gradient with less adversarial noise, thereby stabilizing\ntraining and accelerating convergence. The effectiveness of the AS-GANs is\nverified on image generation on CIFAR-10 , CelebA, and LSUN with varied network\narchitectures.

The problem we explore is to understand how small\nflipping terms can cooperate to flip a large spin to the opposite direction or\na cluster of interacting elementary Ising spins into the time-reversed state.\nThese high order processes will involve at least two channels, a single\nspin-flip channel due to a transverse field and a two-spin flip channel due to\nexchange or due to single-ion anisotropies. In the present paper, we show that\nhigh-order perturbation theory can be formulated and evaluated with the help of\nsimple recurrence relations, leading to a compact theory of tunnelling in\nmacroscopic spins, in one-dimensional clusters, as well as in small\nhigher-dimensional clusters. This is demonstrated explicitly in the case of the\nIsing model with a transverse field and transverse exchange, and in the case of\nmacroscopic spins with uniaxial anisotropy. Our approach provides a transparent\ntheory of level crossings, where the tunneling between time reversed\nconfigurations vanishes as a function of the external field. The crossings\nresult from destructive quantum interferences between competing flipping\nchannels. Our theory consistently predicts N crossings in chains of N Ising\nspins, 2S crossings in single spins of magnitude S, and yields explicit\nanalytical formulae for the level crossings of open chains and macroscopic\nspins. Disorder can be easily implemented in this perturbative formalism.\nLeading disorder effects can be treated analytically for spin rings. At the\nsmallest transverse field crossing, the suppression of tunneling is most robust\nwith respect to disorder.

Under such circumstances, strong duality may break down and the\nprimal and dual might have a nonzero duality gap. Nevertheless, there are\narbitrary small perturbations to the problem data which makes the perturbed\nprimal-dual pair strongly feasible thus zeroing the duality gap. In this paper,\nwe conduct an asymptotic analysis of the optimal value as the perturbation is\ndriven to zero. Specifically, we fix two positive definite matrices (typically\nthe identity matrices), and shift the associated affine spaces of the primal\nand dual slightly in the direction of the two positive definite matrices\npossibly in a different proportion so that the perturbed problems have interior\nfeasible solutions, and analyze the behavior of the optimal value of the\nperturbed problem when the perturbation is reduced to zero keeping the\nproportion. A key feature of our analysis is that no further assumptions such\nas compactness or constraint qualifications are ever made. It will be shown\nthat the optimal value of the perturbed problem converges to a value between\nthe primal and dual optimal values of the original problem. Finally, the\nanalysis leads us to the relatively surprising consequence that the infeasible\ninterior-point algorithms for SDP generates a sequence converging to a number\nbetween the primal and dual optimal values, even in the presence of a nonzero\nduality gap.

Detailed characterizations of exoplanets are moving to the forefront\nof planetary science. Temperature is a key marker for understanding atmospheric\nphysics and chemistry. Aims. We aim to retrieve temperatures of N2-O2 dominated\natmospheres from secondary eclipse spectroscopic observations of the thermal\nemission of Earth-like exoplanets orbiting G-, K-, and M-stars using large\nfuture space telescopes. Methods. Line-by-line radiative transfer was used to\ngenerate synthetic thermal infrared (TIR) observations. Atmospheric temperature\nis approximated by an expansion with base vectors defined by a singular value\ndecomposition of a matrix comprising representative profiles. Nonlinear least\nsquares fitting is used to estimate the expansion coefficients. Results.\nAnalysis of the $4.3 \\rm\\,\\mu m$ and $15 \\rm\\,\\mu m$ CO2 bands in the TIR\npermits inference of temperatures even for low signal-to-noise (S/N) ~5 at\nmedium resolution. Deviations from the true temperature in the upper\ntroposphere and stratosphere are usually a few Kelvin, with larger deviations\nin the upper atmosphere and, less often, in the lower troposphere. Although the\nperformance of the two bands is equivalent in most cases, the longwave TIR is\nmore favorable than the shortwave due to increased star-planet contrast. A high\nspectral resolution, as provided by JWST instruments, is important for\nretaining sensitivity to the upper atmosphere. Furthermore, the selection of an\nappropriate set of base functions is also key. Conclusions. Temperature in the\nmid-atmosphere can be suitably characterized by IR spectroscopy with a\nresolution of at least 1000 (ideally ~2500). Obtaining the necessary S/N could\nbe feasible with future missions, such as the Origins Space Telescope or the\nLarge Interferometer for Exoplanets.

In\ncontrast, software developers release updates to add further features and fix\nflaws in order to increase its security. Consequently, a user of the software\nwants to have the latest secure version running. However, if the software is\nprovided as a service, e.g., as part of the cloud, the user relies on the\nservice provider (SP) to perform such updates. But when asking for the software\nversion, the user has to trust the output of SP or his software. Latter may be\nmalformed, since updating software costs time and money, i.e., in comparison to\nchanging a (false) version string. Now the question rises how a software\nservice's client can provably determine the real software version of the\nrunning service at the SP, also known as Remote Software Identification (RSI).\nWhile existing tools provide an answer, they can be tricked by the service to\noutput any forged string because they rely on the information handed directly\nby the SP. We solve the problem of RSI by introducing Reverse Fingerprinting\n(RFP), a novel challenge-response scheme which employs the evaluation of\ninherit functions of software versions depending on certain inputs. That is,\nRFP does not rely on version number APIs but employs a database consisting of\nfunction inputs and according outputs and combines them with a strategy and a\nrandomness source to provably determine the version number. We also provide a\ntheoretical framework for RSI and RFP, and describe how to create databases and\nstrategies. Additionally, RFP can be securely outsourced to a third party,\ncalled the auditor, to take away the burden of the user while respecting\nliability. We also provide an implementation and API to perform RFP in\npractice, showing that most of the providers have installed the latest\nversions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 10:13:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-23"}

This\nidentification problem for dynamic systems are challenging due to the intrinsic\ndependency of the data. To alleviate this problem, we first formulate this\nidentification problem into a multivariate linear regression problem with\nrow-sub-Gaussian measurement matrix using the more general input designs and\nthe independent repeated sampling schemes. We then propose a nuclear norm\nheuristic method that estimates the parameter matrix of dynamic system from a\nfew input-state data samples. Based on this, we can extend the existing\nresults. In this paper, we consider two scenarios. (i) In the noiseless\nscenario, nuclear-norm minimization is introduced for promoting low-rank. We\ndefine the notion of weak restricted isometry property, which is weaker than\nthe ordinary restricted isometry property, and show it holds with high\nprobability for the row-sub-Gaussian measurement matrix. Thereby, the\nrank-minimization matrix can be exactly recovered from finite number of data\nsamples. (ii) In the noisy scenario, a regularized framework involving nuclear\nnorm penalty is established. We give the notion of operator norm curvature\ncondition for the loss function, and show it holds for row-sub-Gaussian\nmeasurement matrix with high probability. Consequently, when specifying the\nsuitable choice of the regularization parameter, the operator norm error of the\noptimal solution of this program has a sharp bound given a finite amount of\ndata samples. This operator norm error bound is stronger than the ordinary\nFrobenius norm error bound obtained in the existing work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 11:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-23"}

We\ncompute entanglement entropy in a variety of holographic systems, paying\nparticular attention to its long-distance behaviour, characterised by a term\nproportional to surface area. This term is known to decrease along\nLorentz-invariant renormalisation group flows, suggesting that it may count\nmassless degrees of freedom. We find that more general deformations may\nincrease this area term, possibly indicating an enhanced number of\nlong-distance degrees of freedom. We observe a correlation between this\nenhancement and the emergence of new scaling symmetry at long distances. Next,\nwe study the spectrum of collective excitations in a holographic model of a\nnon-Fermi liquid. At high temperatures, the spectrum of collective excitations\nincludes hydrodynamic sound waves. As in similar models, we observe that\nsound-like modes also exist at low temperatures. Such modes are known as\nholographic zero sound. We study the changing properties of holographic zero\nsound and the emergence of hydrodynamic behaviour at high temperatures as we\nvary the parameters of the model.

This makes them an interesting option for\nmajor engineering applications such as motors, generators and magnetic\nbearings. When subjected to transverse alternating fields, superconducting\ntapes face a reduction in the trapped field, and thus it is the goal of this\npaper to understand the influence of all parameters in cross field\ndemagnetization of stacks of tapes. Major parameter dependencies considered for\nthe scope of this paper are ripple field amplitude, frequency, tape width, tape\nthickness (from 1 to 20 $\\mu$m), and number of tapes (up to 20). This article\nalso provides a systemic study of the relaxation time constant $\\tau$, which\ncan be used to estimate the cross-field demagnetization decay for high number\nof cycles. Modeling is based on the Minimum Electro-Magnetic Entropy Production\nmethod, and it is shown that the 2D model gives very accurate results for long\nsamples when compared with 3D model. Analytical formulas for large number of\ncycles have been devised. The results show that when the ripple field amplitude\nis above the penetration field of one tape, the stack always fully\ndemagnetizes, roughly in exponential decay. Increasing the number of tapes only\nincreases the relaxation time. The formulas derived also hold when validated\nagainst numerical results, and can be used for quick approximation of decay\nconstant. They also show that the cause of the decreases of cross-field\ndemagnetization with number of tapes is the increase in the self-inductance of\nthe magnetization currents. The trends and insights obtained for cross field\ndemagnetization for stacks are thus very beneficial for engineers and\nscientists working with superconducting magnet design and applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 13:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

While establishing interdependencies\namong economic agents is crucial for the production of complex products, they\nmay also increase systemic risks due to failure propagation. It is crucial to\nidentify how network connectivity impacts both the emergent production and risk\nof collapse of economic systems. In this paper we propose a model to study the\neffects of network structure on the behavior of economic systems by varying the\ndensity and centralization of connections among agents. The complexity of\nproduction increases with connectivity given the combinatorial explosion of\nparts and products. Emergent systemic risks arise when interconnections\nincrease vulnerabilities. Our results suggest a universal description of\neconomic collapse given in the emergence of tipping points and phase\ntransitions in the relationship between network structure and risk of\nindividual failure. This relationship seems to follow a sigmoidal form in the\ncase of increasingly denser or centralized networks. The model sheds new light\non the relevance of policies for the growth of economic complexity, and\nhighlights the trade-off between increasing the potential production of the\nsystem and its robustness to collapse.

It is believed that the attributes may clarify and enrich the\nknowledge about the actors and give sense to the communities. This belief has\nmotivated the progress in developing community detection methods that use both\nthe structure and the attributes of network (i.e. deal with a node-attributed\ngraph) to yield more informative and qualitative results.\n  During the last decade many such methods based on different ideas have\nappeared.

The zero temperature phase diagrams of systems with competing scalar\norder parameters with quartic and bilinear coupling terms have been previously\nstudied for the cases of a zero temperature bicritical point and of coexisting\norders.

We show that above this critical temperature, the system presents\nscaling behavior consistent with that approaching a quantum critical point.\nBelow the transition the specific heat has a thermally activated contribution\nwith a gap related to the size of the domains of the ordered phases.

It is essential for our understanding of\nmassive star evolution to identify the contribution of binary evolution to the\nformation of double black holes. A promising way to progress is investigating\nthe progenitors of double black hole systems and comparing predictions with\nlocal massive star samples such as the population in 30 Doradus in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC). Methods. To this purpose, we analyse a large grid of\ndetailed binary evolution models at LMC metallicity with initial primary masses\nbetween 10 and 40 Msun, and identify which model systems potentially evolve\ninto a binary consisting of a black hole and a massive main sequence star. We\nthen derive the observable properties of such systems, as well as peculiarities\nof the OB star component. We find that about 3% of the LMC late O and early B\nstars in binaries are expected to possess a black hole companion, when assuming\nstars with a final helium core mass above 6.6 M to form black holes. While the\nvast majority of them may be X-ray quiet, our models suggest that these may be\nidentified in spectroscopic binaries, either by large amplitude radial velocity\nvariations ( > 50 km s ) and simultaneous nitrogen surface enrichment, or\nthrough a moderate radial velocity ( > 10 km/s ) and simultaneously rapid\nrotation of the OB star. The predicted mass ratios are such that main sequence\ncompanions could be excluded in most cases. A comparison to the observed OB+WR\nbinaries in the LMC, Be/X-ray binaries, and known massive BH binaries supports\nour conclusion. We expect spectroscopic observations to be able to test key\nassumptions in our models, with important implications for massive star\nevolution in general, and for the formation of double-black hole mergers in\nparticular.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 14:00:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 14:53:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

The coherent rotation of the magnetic field vector\nobserved in MCs leads to envision MCs as formed by flux ropes (FRs). Among all\nthe methods used to analyze MCs, Lepping's method (Lepping et al, 1990, JGR 95,\n11957) is the broadest used. While this fitting method does not require the\naxial field component to vanish at the MC boundaries, this idea is largely\nspread in publications. Then, we revisit Lepping's method to emphasize its\nhypothesis and the meaning of its output parameters. As originally defined,\nthese parameters imply a fitted FR which could be smaller or larger than the\nstudied MC. We rather provide a re-interpretation of Lepping's results with a\nfitted model limited to the observed MC interval. We find that, typically the\ncrossed FRs are asymmetric with a larger side both in size and magnetic flux\nbefore or after the FR axis. At the boundary of the largest side we find an\naxial magnetic field component distributed around 0 which we justify by the\nphysics of solar eruptions. In contrast, at the boundary of the smaller side\nthe axial field distribution is shifted to positive values, as expected with\nerosion acting during the interplanetary travel. This new analysis of Lepping's\nresults have several implications. First, global quantities, such as magnetic\nfluxes and helicity, need to be revised depending on the aim (estimating global\nproperties of FRs just after the solar launch or at 1 au). Second, the deduced\ntwist profiles in MCs range quasi-continuously from nearly uniform, to\nincreasing away from the FR axis, up to a reversal near the MC boundaries.\nThere is no trace of outsider cases, but a continuum of cases. Finally, the\nimpact parameter of the remaining FR crossed at 1 au is revised. Its\ndistribution is compatible with weakly flatten FR cross-sections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 14:06:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-23"}

We find that the\nstructure growth suppression is a generic feature of power law couplings and it\ncan, for a range of parameter values, be larger than previously found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 14:53:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 09:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

We also introduce both offline and online prediction\nschemes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared to the current\nstate-of-the-art optimization and DL methods, our approach provides higher\nspectral efficiency, lesser computational cost and fewer number of pilot\nsignals, and higher tolerance against the deviations in the received pilot\ndata, corrupted channel matrix, and propagation environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 11:48:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 07:23:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 07:18:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 18:29:22 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 08:15:18 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 11:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

We will show that the structure of the real unit\ninterval naturally arises from a few reasonable assumptions. We do this by\nstudying effect monoids, an abstraction of the algebraic structure of the real\nunit interval: it has an addition $x+y$ which is only defined when $x+y\\leq 1$\nand an involution $x\\mapsto 1-x$ which make it an effect algebra, in\ncombination with an associative (possibly non-commutative) multiplication.\nExamples include the unit intervals of ordered rings and Boolean algebras.\n  We present a structure theory for effect monoids that are $\\omega$-complete,\ni.e. where every increasing sequence has a supremum. We show that any\n$\\omega$-complete effect monoid embeds into the direct sum of a Boolean algebra\nand the unit interval of a commutative unital C$^*$-algebra. This gives us from\nfirst principles a dichotomy between sharp logic, represented by the Boolean\nalgebra part of the effect monoid, and probabilistic logic, represented by the\ncommutative C$^*$-algebra. Some consequences of this characterisation are that\nthe multiplication must always be commutative, and that the unique\n$\\omega$-complete effect monoid without zero divisors and more than 2 elements\nmust be the real unit interval.

Studying the\nobserved circulation in reanalysis data, it is found that when the full field\ndata is used for the k-means cluster analysis instead of the EOFs, the optimal\nnumber of clusters is no longer four but six. The two extra regimes that are\nfound are the opposites of the Atlantic Ridge and Scandinavian Blocking,\nmeaning they have a low-pressure area roughly where the original regimes have a\nhigh-pressure area. This introduces an appealing symmetry in the clustering\nresult. Incorporating a weak persistence constraint in the clustering procedure\nis found to lead to a longer duration of regimes, extending beyond the synoptic\ntimescale, without changing their occurrence rates.

With scant evidence for minor mergers, some connection\nto major mergers is found in isolated environments but not where one would\nexpect, i.e. in clusters. We provide an explanation for these recent results by\nGordon et al (2019) on the relevance of major mergers in low excitation radio\ngalaxies (LERGs) at low redshift.

We provide simple estimates for the fraction of LERGs as a\nfunction of environment that are directly related to these timescales,\nobtaining a probability of about 7% that field LERGs will show merger\nsignatures and 3% for clusters, showing that theory and observation match if\nmajor merger signatures remain visible for a few hundred million years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 15:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

Although\nthese deep learning methods can improve the reconstruction quality compared\nwith iterative methods without requiring complex parameter selection or lengthy\nreconstruction time, the following issues still need to be addressed: 1) all\nthese methods are based on big data and require a large amount of fully sampled\nMRI data, which is always difficult to obtain for cardiac MRI; 2) the effect of\ncoil correlation on reconstruction in deep learning methods for dynamic MR\nimaging has never been studied. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised deep\nlearning method for multi-coil cine MRI via a time-interleaved sampling\nstrategy. Specifically, a time-interleaved acquisition scheme is utilized to\nbuild a set of fully encoded reference data by directly merging the k-space\ndata of adjacent time frames. Then these fully encoded data can be used to\ntrain a parallel network for reconstructing images of each coil separately.\nFinally, the images from each coil are combined via a CNN to implicitly explore\nthe correlations between coils.

In the current study, we develop a method to learn\nan unsupervised few-shot learner via self-supervised training (UFLST), which\ncan effectively generalize to novel but related classes.
