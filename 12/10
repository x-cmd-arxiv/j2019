Second, we consider endpoints $(x,0)$ and $(y,1)$\nbetween which there exist two geodesics intersecting only at times $0$ and $1$.\nWe prove that the set of such $(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2$ also has Hausdorff\ndimension one-half. The proofs require several inputs of independent interest,\nincluding (i) connections to the so-called difference weight profile studied in\narXiv:1904.01717; and (ii) a tail estimate on the number of disjoint geodesics\nstarting and ending in small intervals.

They also showed that any relative-error\nlow-rank approximation algorithm must query $\\Omega(nk/\\epsilon)$ entries of\n$A$, this gap has since remained open. Our main result is to resolve this\nquestion by obtaining an optimal algorithm that queries $O(nk/\\epsilon)$\nentries of $A$ and outputs a relative-error low-rank approximation in\n$O(n(k/\\epsilon)^{\\omega-1})$ time.

To address these\nproblems, we show that the mechanism can be implemented exactly for a rich set\nof values of the privacy parameter $\\varepsilon$ and utility functions with\nlimited practical overhead in running time and minimal code complexity.\n  How do we achieve this result? We employ a simple trick of switching from\nbase $e$ to base $2$, allowing us to perform precise base $2$ arithmetic. A\nshort, precise expression is always available for $\\varepsilon$, and the only\napproximation error we incur is the conversion of the base-2 privacy parameter\nback to base $e$ for reporting purposes.

However, users choose 3X3 patterns\nfrom a small subspace of all possible 389,112 patterns. The two recently\nproposed interfaces, SysPal by Cho et al. and TinPal by the authors,\ndemonstrate that it is possible to influence users 3X3 pattern choices by\nmaking small modifications in the existing interface. While SysPal forces users\nto include one, two or three system-assigned random dots in their pattern,\nTinPal employs a highlighting mechanism to inform users about the set of\nreachable dots from the current selected dot. Both interfaces improved the\nsecurity of 3X3 patterns without affecting usability, but no comparison between\nSysPal and TinPal was presented.\n  To address this gap, we conduct a new user study with 147 participants and\ncollect patterns on three SysPal interfaces, 1-dot, 2-dot and 3-dot. We also\nconsider original and TinPal patterns collected in our previous user study\ninvolving 99 participants. We compare patterns created on five different\ninterfaces, original, TinPal, 1-dot, 2-dot and 3-dot using a range of security\nand usability metrics including pattern length, stroke length, guessability,\nrecall time and login attempts. Our study results show that participants in the\nTinPal group created significantly longer and complex patterns than\nparticipants in the other four groups. Consequently, the guessing resistance of\nTinPal patterns was the highest among all groups. Further, we did not find any\nsignificant difference in memorability of patterns created in the TinPal group\nand the other groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 18:18:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 04:34:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 04:17:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-30"}

As a result, a number of pieces are\ncurrently missing. For instance, the electric network framework allows quantum\nwalks to start from an arbitrary initial state, but it only detects marked\nelements. In recent work by Ambainis et al., this problem was resolved for the\nmore restricted hitting time framework, in which quantum walks must start from\nthe stationary distribution.\n  We present a new quantum walk search framework that unifies and strengthens\nthese frameworks. This leads to a number of new results. For instance, the new\nframework not only detects, but finds marked elements in the electric network\nsetting. The new framework also allows one to interpolate between the hitting\ntime framework, which minimizes the number of walk steps, and the MNRS\nframework, which minimizes the number of times elements are checked for being\nmarked. This allows for a more natural tradeoff between resources. Whereas the\noriginal frameworks only rely on quantum walks and phase estimation, our new\nalgorithm makes use of a technique called quantum fast-forwarding, similar to\nthe recent results by Ambainis et al. As a final result we show how in certain\ncases we can simplify this more involved algorithm to merely applying the\nquantum walk operator some number of times.

Starting point is a general isotropic interacting particle system, as\nused for swarming or follower-leader dynamics. An anisotropy is induced by\nrotation of the force vector resulting from the interaction of two agents. In\nthis way the anisotropy is leading to a smooth evasion behaviour. In fact, the\nproposed model generalizes the standard models, and compensates their drawback\nof not being able to avoid collisions. Moreover, the model allows for formal\npassage to the limit 'number of particles to infinity', leading to a mesoscopic\ndescription in the mean-field sense. Possible applications are autonomous\ntraffic, swarming or pedestrian motion. Here, we focus on the latter, as the\nmodel is validated numerically using two scenarios in pedestrian dynamics. The\nfirst one investigates the pattern formation in a channel, where two groups of\npedestrians are walking in opposite directions. The second experiment considers\na crossing with one group walking from left to right and the other one from\nbottom to top. The well-known pattern of lanes in the channel and travelling\nwaves at the crossing can be reproduced with the help of this anisotropic model\nat both, the microscopic and the mesoscopic level.

First,\nwe assume to know how to compute an exact project onto one of the sets involved\nand the other set is compact such that the conditional gradient (CondG) method\ncan be used for computing efficiently an inexact projection on it. Second, we\nassume that both sets involved are compact such that the CondG method can be\nused for computing efficiently inexact projections on them. We combine\nalternating projection method with CondG method to design a new method, which\ncan be seen as an inexact feasible version of alternate projection method. The\nproposed method generates two different sequences belonging to each involved\nset, which converge to a point in the intersection of them whenever it is not\nempty. If the intersection is empty, then the sequences converge to points in\nthe respective sets whose distance is equal to the distance between the sets in\nconsideration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 18:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

These platforms empower advertisers to target messages to platform\nusers with great precision, including through inferences about those users'\npolitical affiliations. However, prior work has shown that platforms' ad\ndelivery algorithms can selectively deliver ads within these target audiences\nin ways that can lead to demographic skews along race and gender lines, often\nwithout an advertiser's knowledge.\n  In this study, we investigate the impact of Facebook's ad delivery algorithms\non political ads. We run a series of political ads on Facebook and measure how\nFacebook delivers those ads to different groups, depending on an ad's content\n(e.g., the political viewpoint featured) and targeting criteria. We find that\nFacebook's ad delivery algorithms effectively differentiate the price of\nreaching a user based on their inferred political alignment with the advertised\ncontent, inhibiting political campaigns' ability to reach voters with diverse\npolitical views. This effect is most acute when advertisers use small budgets,\nas Facebook's delivery algorithm tends to preferentially deliver to the users\nwho are, according to Facebook's estimation, most relevant.\n  Our findings point to advertising platforms' potential role in political\npolarization and creating informational filter bubbles. Furthermore, some large\nad platforms have recently changed their policies to restrict the targeting\ntools they offer to political campaigns; our findings show that such reforms\nwill be insufficient if the goal is to ensure that political ads are shown to\nusers of diverse political views. Our findings add urgency to calls for more\nmeaningful public transparency into the political advertising ecosystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 18:48:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 18:54:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 18:53:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

Despite the remarkable progress in recent years, the\nprecision of bounding box regression remains unsatisfactory, hence limiting\nperformance in object detection. We observe that precise localization requires\ncareful placement of each side of the bounding box. However, the mainstream\napproach, which focuses on predicting centers and sizes, is not the most\neffective way to accomplish this task, especially when there exists\ndisplacements with large variance between the anchors and the targets. In this\npaper, we propose an alternative approach, named as Side-Aware Boundary\nLocalization (SABL), where each side of the bounding box is respectively\nlocalized with a dedicated network branch. To tackle the difficulty of precise\nlocalization in the presence of displacements with large variance, we further\npropose a two-step localization scheme, which first predicts a range of\nmovement through bucket prediction and then pinpoints the precise position\nwithin the predicted bucket. We test the proposed method on both two-stage and\nsingle-stage detection frameworks. Replacing the standard bounding box\nregression branch with the proposed design leads to significant improvements on\nFaster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and Cascade R-CNN, by 3.0%, 1.7%, and 0.9%,\nrespectively.

The reason of this absence, is that, as the number of qubits is\nincreased, a quantum register inevitably becomes susceptible to an ever\nnarrower bandwidth of frequencies in the reservoir. Furthermore, we show that\nfor superdecoherence to occur in a reservoir with a discrete spectrum, one of\nthe frequencies in the reservoir has to coincide exactly with the frequency the\nquantum register is most susceptible to.

If a gravitational wave\nsource is eclipsed by a star, measuring these perturbations provides a way to\ndirectly measure the distribution of mass throughout the stellar interior. We\ncompute the expected Shapiro time delay, amplification and deflection during an\neclipse, and show how this can be used to infer the mass distribution of the\neclipsing body. We identify continuous gravitational waves from neutron stars\nas the best candidates to detect this effect. When the Sun eclipses a far-away\nsource, depending on the depth of the eclipse the time-delay can change by up\nto $\\sim 0.034$ ms, the gravitational-wave strain amplitude can increase by\n$\\sim 4$%, and the apparent position of the source in the sky can vary by\n$4''$.

Even for the most rapidly\nrotating neutron stars, this time delay only corresponds to a few percent of\nthe phase of the gravitational wave, making it an extremely challenging\nmeasurement. However, if sources of continuous gravitational waves exist just\nbelow the limit of detection of current observatories, next-generation\ninstruments will be able to observe them with enough precision to measure the\nsignal of an eclipsing star.

While the absolute value\nof the SFMS slope depends on the fitting method, the slope is steeper for\nlonger star formation time-scales and lower spatial resolutions regardless of\nthe fitting method employed. We present a toy model that quantitatively\ncaptures the dependence of the simulated galaxies' rSFMS slope on spatial\nresolution and use it to illustrate how this dependence can be used to\nconstrain the characteristic mass of star-forming clumps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 19:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 19:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-06"}

Currently, most\nmandated development-related transportation planning is intended to prepare for\nfrequently occurring and observable disruptions while low probability events\nthat have not yet materialized attract less attention. When road networks are\nnot resilient, these unpredictable events can cause significant delays that may\nnot be proportional to the extent of the disruption. Enhancing resilience can\nhelp in mitigating consequences of disruptions but requires financial\ninvestment that is difficult to justify given that low probability event may\nnot have materialized. This paper highlights economic implications of\nunmitigated random disruptions in urban road systems and makes the case for\ninvestment in transportation network resilience. We utilized a model of urban\ntransportation network performance that quantifies resilience and demonstrated\nits integration with microeconomic transportation planning model REMI\nTranSight. The model was applied to 10 cities in the USA to calculate several\neconomic indicators under baseline scenario where economic impact was assumed\nto be proportional to the magnitude of disruptive events and under a test\nscenario where the magnitude of disruption was used to calculate additional\ndelays in transportation networks and these additional delays were explicitly\nintegrated in REMI model. Results show that GDP losses suffered as a result of\ndisruption may be far more significant in the case scenario and economic output\nis not necessarily back to normal in the year the following disruptive event.\nWe thus conclude that support for investment decisions on network efficiency\nand resilience management should be based on a framework that utilizes\nresilience, quantified in terms that are compatible with standard practice, and\nscenarios to test the implications of topological attributes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 19:17:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

Here, we present a study of magnetic clusters with spin-$S$ moments\ncoupled by Kitaev interactions. We focus on two cluster geometries -- the\nKitaev square and the Kitaev tetrahedron -- that allow us to explicitly\nenumerate all classical ground states. In both cases, the classical ground\nstate space (CGSS) is large and self-intersecting, with non-manifold character.\nThe Kitaev square has a CGSS of four intersecting circles that can be embedded\nin four dimensions. The tetrahedron CGSS consists of eight spheres embedded in\nsix dimensions. In the semi-classical large-$S$ limit, we argue for effective\nlow energy descriptions in terms of a single particle moving on these\nnon-manifold spaces. Remarkably, at low energies, the particle is tied down in\nbound states formed around singularities at self-intersection points. In the\nlanguage of spins, the low energy physics is determined by a distinct set of\nstates that lies well below other eigenstates. These correspond to `Cartesian'\nstates, a special class of classical ground states that are constructed from\ndimer covers of the underlying lattice. They completely determine the low\nenergy physics despite being a small subset of the classical ground state\nspace. This provides an example of order by singularity, where state selection\nbecomes stronger upon approaching the classical limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 19:44:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 04:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

The process of PQ loading in human\nerythrocytes, as well as the effect of PQ loading on the oxidative status of\nerythrocytes, was also studied. At PQ concentrations of 2, 4, 6, and 8 mg/mL\nand an incubation time of 2 h, the ratios of the concentrations of PQ entrapped\nin erythrocytes to that in the incubation medium were 0.515, 0.688, 0.697 and\n0.788, respectively. The maximal decline of erythrocyte reduced glutathione\ncontent was observed at 8 mg/mL of PQ compared with native erythrocytes p <\n0.001. In contrast, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl were significantly\nincreased in cells loaded with PQ (p < 0.001). Furthermore, osmotic fragility\nof PQ carrier erythrocytes was increased in comparison with unloaded cells.\nElectron microscopy revealed spherocyte formation with PQ carrier erythrocytes.\nPQ-loaded cells showed sustained drug release over a 48 h period. Erythrocytes\nwere loaded with PQ successfully, but there were some biochemical as well as\nphysiological changes that resulted from the effect of PQ on the oxidative\nstatus of drug-loaded erythrocytes. These changes may result in favorable\ntargeting of PQ-loaded cells to reticulo-endothelial organs. The relative\nimpact of these changes remains to be explored in ongoing animal studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 20:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-12"}

Empirical\nconstraints come from chemical and isotopic measurements of solar system bodies\nand of Earth itself. Dynamical models have revealed pathways for water delivery\nto Earth during its formation; most are anchored to specific models for\nterrestrial planet formation. Meanwhile, disk chemical models focus on\ndetermining how the isotopic ratios of the building blocks of planets varied as\na function of radial distance and time, defining markers of material\ntransported along those pathways. Carbonaceous chondrite meteorites --\nrepresentative of the outer asteroid belt -- match Earth's water isotopes\n(although mantle plumes have been measured at lower D/H). But how was this\nconnection established -- did Earth's water originate among the asteroids (as\nin the classical model of terrestrial planet formation)? Or, more likely, was\nEarth's water delivered from the same parent population as the hydrated\nasteroids (e.g., external pollution, as in the Grand Tack model)? We argue that\nthe outer asteroid belt -- the boundary between the inner and outer solar\nsystem -- is the next frontier for new discoveries. The outer asteroid belt\ncontains a population of icy bodies with volatile-driven activity seen on\ntwelve main belt comets (MBCs); seven of which exhibit sublimation-driven\nactivity on repeated perihelion passages. Measurements of the isotopic\ncharacteristics of MBCs would provide essential missing links in the chain\nbetween disk models and dynamical models. Finally, we extrapolate to rocky\nexoplanets. Migration is the only mechanism likely to produce very water-rich\nplanets with more than a few percent water by mass (and even with migration,\nsome planets are pure rock). While water loss mechanisms remain to be studied\nin more detail, we expect that water should be delivered to the vast majority\nof rocky exoplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 20:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Even though Telgarsky's work reveals the limitations of shallow\nneural networks, it does not inform us on why these functions are difficult to\nrepresent and in fact he states it as a tantalizing open question to\ncharacterize those functions that cannot be well-approximated by smaller\ndepths.\n  In this work, we point to a new connection between DNNs expressivity and\nSharkovsky's Theorem from dynamical systems, that enables us to characterize\nthe depth-width trade-offs of ReLU networks for representing functions based on\nthe presence of generalized notion of fixed points, called periodic points (a\nfixed point is a point of period 1). Motivated by our observation that the\ntriangle waves used in Telgarsky's work contain points of period 3 - a period\nthat is special in that it implies chaotic behavior based on the celebrated\nresult by Li-Yorke - we proceed to give general lower bounds for the width\nneeded to represent periodic functions as a function of the depth. Technically,\nthe crux of our approach is based on an eigenvalue analysis of the dynamical\nsystem associated with such functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 21:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

By\ncombining a repeatable point detection with a descriptor, parts of an image can\nbe matched with one another, which is useful in applications like estimating\npose from camera input or rectifying images. Recently, precise indoor tracking\nhas started to become important for Augmented and Virtual reality as it is\nnecessary to allow positioning of a headset in 3D space without the need for\nexternal tracking devices. Several modern feature detectors use homographies to\nsimulate different viewpoints, not only to train feature detection and\ndescription, but test them as well. The problem is that, often, views of indoor\nspaces contain high depth disparity. This makes the approximation that a\nhomography applied to an image represents a viewpoint change inaccurate. We\nclaim that in order to train detectors to work well in indoor environments,\nthey must be robust to this type of geometry, and repeatable under true\nviewpoint change instead of homographies. Here we focus on the problem of\ndetecting repeatable feature locations under true viewpoint change. To this\nend, we generate labeled 2D images from a photo-realistic 3D dataset. These\nimages are used for training a neural network based feature detector. We\nfurther present an algorithm for automatically generating labels of repeatable\n2D features, and present a fast, easy to use test algorithm for evaluating a\ndetector in an 3D environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 21:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

This review presents\nelectromagnetic field calculations in waveguides, cavity fields, and photonic\ncrystals.

The ongoing campaign started in May 2018,\nand we report here on $\\sim1.5$ years of observations. The campaign, which\nconsists of 105 observations, has a typical cadence of 3--6 days, and has the\ngoal of determining the long-term X-ray variability of the ULXs. Two of the\nmost variable sources were ULX7 and ULX8, both of which are known to be powered\nby neutron stars that are exceeding their isotropic Eddington luminosities by\nfactors of up to 100. This is further evidence that neutron star powered ULXs\nare the most variable. Our two main results are, first, that ULX7 exhibits a\nperiodic flux modulation with a period of 38 days varying over a magnitude and\na half in flux from peak to trough. Since the orbital period of the system is\nknown to be 2 days, the modulation is super-orbital, which is a near-ubiquitous\nproperty of ULX pulsars.

Next, we conduct a simulation\nexperiment assessing the impact of including unnecessary variables on the\nperformance of the parametric g-computation transport estimator.

We find that addition of variables\nthat are not causes of the outcome but whose distributions differ between the\nsource and target populations can increase the variance and mean squared error\nof the transported estimates. On the other hand, inclusion of variables that\nare causes of the outcome (regardless of whether they modify the causal\ncontrast of interest or differ in distribution between the populations) reduces\nthe variance of the estimates without increasing the bias. Finally, exclusion\nof variables that cause the outcome but do not modify the causal contrast of\ninterest does not increase bias.

A central challenge in imitating human\nvideos is the difference in appearance between the human and robot, which\ntypically requires manual correspondence. We instead take an automated approach\nand perform pixel-level image translation via CycleGAN to convert the human\ndemonstration into a video of a robot, which can then be used to construct a\nreward function for a model-based RL algorithm. The robot then learns the task\none stage at a time, automatically learning how to reset each stage to retry it\nmultiple times without human-provided resets.

Dynamic trajectory planning task is decoupled into\nlateral spatial and longitudinal velocity planning problems. A bunch of\ncandidate trajectory sets are generated and evaluated by an object function\nwhich considers kinematic feasibility, trajectory smoothness, driving comfort\nand collision-checking. Meanwhile, an LQG controller is used to generate\nlongitudinal velocity profile to ensure safety and comfort.

In this work, we aim to build a neural network that\nlearns the noise patterns from the data and predict/regress the model\nparameters from the noisy relative orientations.

Such imbalanced distribution causes a great\nchallenge for learning a deep neural network, which can be boiled down into a\ndilemma: on the one hand, we prefer to increase the exposure of tail class\nsamples to avoid the excessive dominance of head classes in the classifier\ntraining. On the other hand, oversampling tail classes makes the network prone\nto over-fitting, since head class samples are often consequently\nunder-represented. To resolve this dilemma, in this paper, we propose a\nsimple-yet-effective auxiliary learning approach. The key idea is to split a\nnetwork into a classifier part and a feature extractor part, and then employ\ndifferent training strategies for each part. Specifically, to promote the\nawareness of tail-classes, a class-balanced sampling scheme is utilised for\ntraining both the classifier and the feature extractor. For the feature\nextractor, we also introduce an auxiliary training task, which is to train a\nclassifier under the regular random sampling scheme. In this way, the feature\nextractor is jointly trained from both sampling strategies and thus can take\nadvantage of all training data and avoid the over-fitting issue. Apart from\nthis basic auxiliary task, we further explore the benefit of using\nself-supervised learning as the auxiliary task.

Recently, the domain wall -- magnetic tunnel\njunction (DW-MTJ) artificial neuron is demonstrated in modeling to be\ninherently inhibitory.

However, the lateral inhibition mechanism in DW-MTJ neurons has\nnot been studied thoroughly, leading to weak inhibition only in very\nclosely-spaced devices.

Compared with features produced in earlier\nlayers, the deep features are better at expressing semantic and contextual\ninformation. The proposed deep feature learning scheme shifts the focus from\nconcrete features with details to abstract ones with semantic information. It\nconsiders not only individual objects and local contexts but also their\nrelationships by building a multi-scale deep feature learning network (MDFN).\nMDFN efficiently detects the objects by introducing information square and\ncubic inception modules into the high-level layers, which employs\nparameter-sharing to enhance the computational efficiency. MDFN provides a\nmulti-scale object detector by integrating multi-box, multi-scale and\nmulti-level technologies. Although MDFN employs a simple framework with a\nrelatively small base network (VGG-16), it achieves better or competitive\ndetection results than those with a macro hierarchical structure that is either\nvery deep or very wide for stronger ability of feature extraction. The proposed\ntechnique is evaluated extensively on KITTI, PASCAL VOC, and COCO datasets,\nwhich achieves the best results on KITTI and leading performance on PASCAL VOC\nand COCO. This study reveals that deep features provide prominent semantic\ninformation and a variety of contextual contents, which contribute to its\nsuperior performance in detecting small or occluded objects. In addition, the\nMDFN model is computationally efficient, making a good trade-off between the\naccuracy and speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 05:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

The standard approach relies on the kernel trick to perform pairwise\nevaluations of a kernel function, which leads to scalability issues for large\ndatasets due to its linear and superlinear growth with respect to the training\ndata. A popular approach to tackle this problem, known as random Fourier\nfeatures (RFFs), samples from a distribution to obtain the data-independent\nbasis of a higher finite-dimensional feature space, where its dot product\napproximates the kernel function. Recently, deterministic, rather than random\nconstruction has been shown to outperform RFFs, by approximating the kernel in\nthe frequency domain using Gaussian quadrature. In this paper, we view the dot\nproduct of these explicit mappings not as an approximation, but as an\nequivalent positive-definite kernel that induces a new finite-dimensional\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This opens the door to no-trick (NT)\nonline kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) that is scalable and robust. Random\nfeatures are prone to large variances in performance, especially for smaller\ndimensions. Here, we focus on deterministic feature-map construction based on\npolynomial-exact solutions and show their superiority over random\nconstructions. Without loss of generality, we apply this approach to classical\nadaptive filtering algorithms and validate the methodology to show that\ndeterministic features are faster to generate and outperform state-of-the-art\nkernel methods based on random Fourier features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 06:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

This\nstudy aims to develop an analysis system that can automatically locate four\nanatomic landmarks, measure BA and CAG for fracture assessment, identify\nfractured calcaneus, and segment fractured regions.

Here we present a multi-reference\nfirst-principles analysis of the g-tensor and the spin-phonon coupling in a\nseries of four exa-coordinate Vanadium(IV) molecular complexes, where the\ncatecholate ligand donor atom is progressively changed from Oxygen to Sulphur,\nSelenium and Tellurium. A ligand field interpretation of the multi-reference\nelectronic structure theory results made it possible to rationalize the\ncorrelation between the molecular g-shifts and the average spin-phonon coupling\ncoefficients, revealing the role of spin-orbit coupling, chemical bond\ncovalency and energy splitting of d-like orbitals in spin relaxation. Our study\nreveals the simultaneous increase of metal-ligand covalency and electronic\nexcited state energy separation as key elements of an optimal strategy towards\nlong spin-lattice lifetimes in molecular qubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 07:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

One\nof the major reasons behind distracted driving is the use of cell-phones,\naccounting for 14% of fatal crashes. Social media applications have enabled\nusers to stay connected, however, the use of such applications while driving\ncould have serious repercussions -- often leading the user to be distracted\nfrom the road and ending up in an accident. In the context of impression\nmanagement, it has been discovered that individuals often take a risk (such as\nteens smoking cigarettes, indulging in narcotics, and participating in unsafe\nsex) to improve their social standing. Therefore, viewing the phenomena of\nposting distracted driving posts under the lens of self-presentation, it can be\nhypothesized that users often indulge in risk-taking behavior on social media\nto improve their impression among their peers. In this paper, we first try to\nunderstand the severity of such social-media-based distractions by analyzing\nthe content posted on a popular social media site where the user is driving and\nis also simultaneously creating content. To this end, we build a deep learning\nclassifier to identify publicly posted content on social media that involves\nthe user driving.

However, the presence of non-Gaussian\nsignals associated with muscle activity has been reported in recent studies,\nand there is no general model of the distribution of EMG signals that can\nexplain both non-Gaussian and Gaussian distributions within a unified scheme.\nMethods: In this paper, we describe the formulation of a non-Gaussian EMG model\nbased on a scale mixture distribution. In the model, an EMG signal at a certain\ntime follows a Gaussian distribution, and its variance is handled as a random\nvariable that follows an inverse gamma distribution. Accordingly, the\nprobability distribution of EMG signals is assumed to be a mixture of Gaussians\nwith the same mean but different variances. The EMG variance distribution is\nestimated via marginal likelihood maximization. Results: Experiments involving\nnine participants revealed that the proposed model provides a better fit to\nrecorded EMG signals than conventional EMG models.

The core idea is to\nexploit the structure of the subfields for designing a doubly-recursive\nstrategy of reduction: both recursive in the rank of the module and in the\nfield we are working in. Besides, we demonstrate how to leverage the inherent\nsymplectic geometry existing in the tower of fields to provide a significant\nspeed-up of the reduction for rank two modules. The recursive strategy over the\nrank can also be applied to the reduction of Euclidean lattices, and we can\nperform a reduction in asymptotically almost the same time as matrix\nmultiplication. As a byproduct of the design of these fast reductions, we also\ngeneralize to all cyclotomic fields and provide speedups for many previous\nnumber theoretical algorithms. Quantitatively, we show that a module of rank 2\nover a cyclotomic field of degree $n$ can be heuristically reduced within\napproximation factor $2^{\\tilde{O}(n)}$ in time $\\tilde{O}(n^2B)$, where $B$ is\nthe bitlength of the entries.

While these two procedures are the most prominent, they were originally\ndesigned for homogeneous test statistics, that is, when the null distribution\nfunctions of the $p$-values $F_i$, $1\\leq i\\leq m$, are all equal. In many\napplications, however, the data are heterogeneous which leads to heterogeneous\nnull distribution functions. Ignoring this heterogeneity usually induces a\nconservativeness for the aforementioned procedures. In this paper, we develop\nthree new procedures that incorporate the $F_i$'s, while ensuring the FDX\ncontrol. The heterogeneous version of [LR], denoted [HLR], is based on the\narithmetic average of the $F_i$'s, while the heterogeneous version of [GR],\ndenoted [HGR], is based on the geometric average of the $F_i$'s. We also\nintroduce a procedure [PB], that is based on the Poisson-binomial distribution\nand that uniformly improves [HLR] and [HGR], at the price of a higher\ncomputational complexity. Perhaps surprisingly, this shows that, contrary to\nthe known theory of false discovery rate (FDR) control under heterogeneity, the\nway to incorporate the $F_i$'s can be particularly simple in the case of FDX\ncontrol, and does not require any further correction term. The performances of\nthe new proposed procedures are illustrated by real and simulated data in two\nimportant heterogeneous settings: first, when the test statistics are\ncontinuous but the $p$-values are weighted by some known independent weight\nvector, e.g., coming from co-data sets; second, when the test statistics are\ndiscretely distributed, as is the case for data representing frequencies or\ncounts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 10:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

TDOA values are computed with\nrespect to pairs of fixed sensors that are required to be accurately\ntime-synchronized. This constitutes a weakness as all synchronization\ntechniques are vulnerable to delay injections. Attackers are able either to\nspoof the signal or to inject asymmetric delays in the communication channel.\nBy nature, TDOA measurements are highly sensitive to time-synchronization\noffsets between sensors. Our first contribution is to show that timing attacks\ncan severely affect the localization process. With a delay of a few\nmicroseconds injected on one sensor, the resulting estimate might be several\nkilometers away from the true location of the unknown source. We also show that\nresidual analysis does not enable the detection and identification of timing\nattacks. Our second contribution is to propose a two-step TDOA-localization\ntechnique that is robust against timing attacks. It uses a known source to\ndefine a weight for each pair of sensors, reflecting the confidence in their\ntime synchronization. Our solution then uses the weighted least-squares\nestimator with the newly created weights and the TDOA measurements received\nfrom the unknown source. As a result, our method either identifies the network\nas being too corrupt to localize, or gives a corrected estimate of the unknown\nposition along with a confidence metric.

Interference is one of\nthe major causes of service degradation and deficient operational efficiency.\nMoreover, the satellite spectrum is becoming more crowded, as more satellites\nare being launched for different applications. This increases the risk of\ninterference, which causes anomalies in the received signal, and mandates the\nadoption of techniques that can enable the automatic and real-time detection of\nsuch anomalies as a first step towards interference mitigation and suppression.\nIn this paper, we present a Machine Learning (ML)-based approach able to\nguarantee a real-time and automatic detection of both short-term and long-term\ninterference in the spectrum of the received signal at the base station. The\nproposed approach can localize the interference both in time and in frequency\nand is universally applicable across a discrete set of different signal\nspectra.

Seidler and de Wolff recently showed that sums of nonnegative\ncircuit (SONC) polynomials can be used to compute global lower bounds (called\nSONC bounds) for polynomials in this manner in polynomial time, as long as the\npolynomial is bounded from below and its support satisfies a nondegeneracy\nassumption. The quality of the SONC bound depends on the circuits used in the\ncomputation, but finding the set of circuits that yield the best attainable\nSONC bound among the astronomical number of candidate circuits is a non-trivial\ntask that has not been addressed so far. In this paper we propose an efficient\nmethod to compute the optimal SONC lower bound by iteratively identifying the\noptimal circuits to use in the SONC bounding process. The method is based on a\nnew proof of a recent result by Wang which states that (under the same\nnondegeneracy assumption) every SONC polynomial decomposes into SONC\npolynomials on the same support. Our proof, based on convex programming\nduality, removes the nondegeneracy assumption and motivates an algorithm that\ngenerates an optimal set of circuits and computes the corresponding SONC bound\nin a manner that is particularly attractive for sparse polynomials. The method\nis implemented and tested on a large set of sparse polynomial optimization\nproblems with up to 40 unknowns, of degree up to 60, and up to 3000 monomials\nin the support. The results indicate that the method is efficient in practice.\n[abstract truncated for arXiv character limits]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 14:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

However, due\nto the nonvolatile property, NVMs become vulnerable to attacks and require\nsecurity mechanisms, e.g., counter mode encryption and integrity tree, which\nintroduce the security metadata. NVMs promise to recover these security\nmetadata after a system crash, including the counter and integrity tree.\nHowever, unlike merkle tree reconstructed from user data, recovering SGX\nintegrity tree (SIT) has to address the challenges from unique top-down\nhierarchical dependency. Moreover, writing overhead and recovery time are\nimportant metrics for evaluating persistent memory system due to the high costs\nof NVM writes and IT downtime. How to recover the security metadata, i.e.,\ncounter blocks and integrity tree nodes, with low write overhead and short\nrecovery time, becomes much important.\n  To provide a fast recovery scheme with low write overhead, we propose STAR, a\ncost-efficient scheme for recovering counter blocks and SGX integrity tree\nnodes after crashes. For fast recovery and verification, STAR synergizes the\nMAC and correct data, uses bitmap lines in ADR to indicate the location of\nstale node and constructs a cached merkle tree to verify the correctness of the\nrecovery process. Moreover, STAR uses a multi-layer index to speed up the\nrecovery process. STAR also allows different configurations to meet adaptive\nrequirements for write overhead and recovery time. Our evaluation results show\nthat the proposed STAR reduces the number of memory writes by up to 87\\%\ncompared with state-of-the-art work, Anubis, which needs extra 1x memory\nwrites.

These\nnetwork parameters are not easily measured in the network, but may be estimated\nempirically. In this work, we present a new approach of using an ensemble of\nnetwork parameters estimates. The ensembles include a huge number of parameter\npair estimates calculated from simultaneously solving pairs of time instances\nof the governing GIC equation. Each individual estimate is not the true state\nof the system, but a possible state. Taking the ensemble as a whole though\ngives the most probable parameter estimate. The most probable parameter\nestimate for both network parameters, as defined by their respective ensembles,\nis used directly in the modelling of GICs. The ensembles themselves however\nallow for further analysis into the nature of GICs.

Using a range of estimates\nfrom the ensemble, a GIC prediction band is produced. This band corresponds to\nan error estimate for predicted GIC.

This\nis especially useful in regions, such as southern Africa, where there is a\nsparse array of absolute magnetometers available for geomagnetic field\nmeasurements. In terms of geomagnetic field interpolation, the spherical\nelementary current systems (SECS) spatial interpolation scheme has shown to be\nvery successful, and the planar approximation of this method adequate for\nmodelling at mid-latitudes. The SECS interpolation scheme is physics based,\nmaking use of the Biot-Savart law and equivalent ionospheric currents to\ninterpolate measured geomagnetic field data. As with most interpolation\nmethods, more data points result in lower error. Therefore, we adapt the SECS\nmethod to work with variometers. These instruments measure variations in\nmagnetic field and are more abundant in southern Africa. Merging the two\nresulting interpolated datasets, the initial absolute geomagnetic field\ninterpolation can be significantly improved. This improved interpolation scheme\nis not only incredibly useful locally, where a sparse magnetometer array is a\nchallenge, but can also be applied just as effectively in other cases across\nthe globe where there are numerous magnetometers and variometers available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 15:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

In this way, only a single feature is generated between two\nintermediate nodes. The memory for storing intermediate features and the\nresource budget for conducting convolution operations are both reduced\nremarkably. Despite high efficiency, our search strategy can search in a more\nfine-grained way than existing works and increases the capacity for\nrepresenting possible networks.

The network operators become Network Slice Tenants (NSTs).\nThe InP performs the resource allocation based on a vector of weights chosen\nstrategically by each NST. The weights distribute the NST's share of resources\nbetween its subscribers in each cell. We propose a strategy profile in which\nthe NST chooses weights equal to the product of its share by the ratio between\nthe total number of subscribers in the cell and the total number of subscribers\nin the network. We characterize the proposed solution in terms of subscription\nratios and fractions of subscribers, for different cell capacities and user\nsensitivities. The proposed solution provides the exact values for the Nash\nequilibrium if the cells are homogeneous in terms of normalized capacity, which\nis a measure of the total amount of resources available in the cell. Otherwise,\nif the cells are heterogeneous, it provides an accurate approximation. We\nquantify the deviation from the equilibrium and conclude that it is highly\naccurate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 15:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

Pebbles from the protoplanetary disk are\nblocked from flowing into the circumplanetary disk by the positive pressure\ngradient at the outer edge of the planetary gap, so the gas drag assisted\ncapture of planetesimals should be the main contributor to the delivery of\nsolids onto circum-planetary disks. However, a consistent framework for the\nsubsequent accretion of the moons remains to be built. Here we use numerical\nintegrations to show that most planetesimals being captured within a\ncircum-planetary disk are strongly ablated due to the frictional heating they\nexperience, thus supplying the disk with small dust grains, whereas only a\nsmall fraction 'survives' their capture. We then construct a simple model of a\ncircum-planetary disk supplied by ablation, where the flux of solids through\nthe disk is at equilibrium with the ablation supply rate, and investigate the\nformation of moons in such disks. We show that the growth of satellites is\ndriven mainly by accretion of the pebbles that coagulate from the ablated\nmaterial. The pebble-accreting protosatellites rapidly migrate inward and pile\nup in resonant chains at the inner edge of the circum-planetary disk. We\npropose that dynamical instabilities in these resonant chains are at the origin\nof the different architectures of Jupiter's and Saturn's moon systems. The\nassembly of moon systems through pebble accretion can therefore be seen as a\ndown-scaled manifestation of the same process that forms systems of\nsuper-Earths and terrestrial-mass planets around solar-type stars and M-dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 15:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

A promising\nstrand of research inspired from biology is understanding representations at\nthe unit level as it offers a more granular and intuitive interpretation of the\nneural mechanisms. In order to better understand what facilitates increases in\nwidth without decreases in accuracy, we ask: Are there mechanisms at the unit\nlevel by which networks control their effective complexity as their width is\nincreased? If so, how do these depend on the architecture, dataset, and\ntraining parameters? We identify two distinct types of \"frivolous\" units that\nproliferate when the network's width is increased: prunable units which can be\ndropped out of the network without significant change to the output and\nredundant units whose activities can be expressed as a linear combination of\nothers. These units imply complexity constraints as the function the network\nrepresents could be expressed by a network without them. We also identify how\nthe development of these units can be influenced by architecture and a number\nof training factors.

It is based on amplification steps due to an\ninterplay between renewal and differentiation in the successive cell\ncompartments from stem cells to red blood cells. We will study this mechanism\nwith a stochastic point of view to explain unexpected fluctuations on the red\nblood cell numbers, as surprisingly observed by biologists and medical doctors\nin a rest erythropoiesis. We consider three compartments: stem cells,\nprogenitors and red blood cells. The dynamics of each cell type is\ncharacterized by its division rate and by the renewal and differentiation\nprobabilities at each division event. We model the global population dynamics\nby a three-dimensional stochastic decomposable branching process. We show that\nthe amplification mechanism is given by the inverse of the small difference\nbetween the differentiation and renewal probabilities. Introducing a parameter\n$K$ which scales simultaneously the size of the first component, the\ndifferentiation and renewal probabilities and the red blood cell death rate, we\ndescribe the asymptotic behavior of the process for large $K$. We show that\neach compartment has its own size scale and its own time scale. Focussing on\nthe third component, we prove that the red blood cell population size,\nconveniently renormalized (in time and size), is expanded in an usual way\ninducing large fluctuations.

Thermodynamically, the\nadvancing and receding angles are often interpreted as the maximum and minimum\ncontact angles that can be formed by a droplet without losing its stability.\nDespite intensive research on wetting of rough surfaces, the gravitational\neffect on these angles has been overlooked because most studies have considered\ndroplets smaller than the capillary length. In this study, however, by\ncombining theoretical and numerical modeling, we show that the shape of a\ndroplet smaller than the capillary length can be substantially modified by\ngravity under advancing and receding conditions. First, based on the Laplace\npressure equation, we predict the shape of a two-dimensional Cassie-Baxter\ndroplet on a textured surface with gravity at each pinning point. Then the\nstability of the droplet is tested by examining the interference between the\nliquid surface and neighboring pillars as well as analyzing the free energy\nchange upon depinning. Interestingly, it turns out that the apparent contact\nangles under advancing and receding conditions are not affected by gravity,\nwhile the overall shape of a droplet and the position of the pinning point is\naffected by gravity. In addition, the advancing and receding of the droplet\nwith continuously increasing or decreasing volume is analyzed, and it is showed\nthat the gravitational effect plays a key role on the movement of the droplet\ntip. Finally, the theoretical predictions were validated against line-tension\nbased front tracking modeling that seamlessly captures the attachment and\ndetachment between the liquid surface and the solid substrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 23:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-12"}

However, since traffic\ndata are mostly collected by traffic sensors or probe vehicles, sensor failures\nand the lack of probe vehicles will inevitably result in missing values in the\ncollected raw data for some specific links in the traffic network. Although\nmissing values can be imputed, existing data imputation methods normally need\nlong-term historical traffic state data. As for short-term traffic forecasting,\nespecially under edge computing and online prediction scenarios, traffic\nforecasting models with the capability of handling missing values are needed.\nIn this study, we consider the traffic network as a graph and define the\ntransition between network-wide traffic states at consecutive time steps as a\ngraph Markov process. In this way, missing traffic states can be inferred step\nby step and the spatial-temporal relationships among the roadway links can be\nIncorporated. Based on the graph Markov process, we propose a new neural\nnetwork architecture for spatial-temporal data forecasting, i.e. the graph\nMarkov network (GMN). By incorporating the spectral graph convolution\noperation, we also propose a spectral graph Markov network (SGMN). The proposed\nmodels are compared with baseline models and tested on three real-world traffic\nstate datasets with various missing rates. Experimental results show that the\nproposed GMN and SGMN can achieve superior prediction performance in terms of\nboth accuracy and efficiency. Besides, the proposed models' parameters,\nweights, and predicted results are comprehensively analyzed and visualized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 09:42:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-12"}

When datasets are\nunrepresentative, trained models are prone to bias because they are unable to\ngeneralise to real world settings. This is particularly problematic for models\ntrained in specific cultural contexts, which may not represent a wide range of\nraces, and thus fail to generalise. This is a particular challenge for Driver\ndrowsiness detection, where many publicly available datasets are\nunrepresentative as they cover only certain ethnicity groups. Traditional\naugmentation methods are unable to improve a model's performance when tested on\nother groups with different facial attributes, and it is often challenging to\nbuild new, more representative datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nframework that boosts the performance of detection of drowsiness for different\nethnicity groups. Our framework improves Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\ntrained for prediction by using Generative Adversarial networks (GAN) for\ntargeted data augmentation based on a population bias visualisation strategy\nthat groups faces with similar facial attributes and highlights where the model\nis failing. A sampling method selects faces where the model is not performing\nwell, which are used to fine-tune the CNN. Experiments show the efficacy of our\napproach in improving driver drowsiness detection for under represented\nethnicity groups. Here, models trained on publicly available datasets are\ncompared with a model trained using the proposed data augmentation strategy.\nAlthough developed in the context of driver drowsiness detection, the proposed\nframework is not limited to the driver drowsiness detection task, but can be\napplied to other applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 13:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-30"}

However, a FC matrix is neither a natural image which contains\nshape and texture information, nor a vector of independent features, which\nrenders the extracting of efficient features from matrices as a challenging\nproblem. A brain network, also named as connectome, could forma a graph\nstructure naturally, the nodes of which are brain regions and the edges are\ninterregional connectivity. Thus, in this study, we proposed novel graph\nconvolutional networks (GCNs) to extract efficient disease-related features\nfrom FC matrices. Considering the time-dependent nature of brain activity, we\ncomputed dynamic FC matrices with sliding-windows and implemented a graph\nconvolution based LSTM (long short term memory) layer to process dynamic\ngraphs. Moreover, the demographics of patients were also used to guide the\nclassification. However, unlike in conventional methods where personal\ninformation, i.e., gender and age were added as extra inputs, we argue that\nthis kind of approach may not actually improve the classification performance,\nfor such personal information given in dataset was usually balanced\ndistributed. In this paper, we proposed to utilize the demographic information\nas extra outputs and to share parameters among three networks predicting\nsubject status, gender and age, which serve as assistant tasks. We tested the\nperformance of the proposed architecture in ADNI II dataset to classify\nAlzheimer's disease patients from normal controls. The classification accuracy,\nsensitivity and specificity reach 0.90, 0.92 and 0.89 on ADNI II dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 06:43:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}
