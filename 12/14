The first stage is a\ncombination of day-ahead hourly and real-time sub-hourly model, which means the\nday-ahead dispatch result must also satisfy the real-time condition at the same\ntime. The second stage is to verify the feasibility of the day-ahead dispatch\nresult in worst-case condition considering high-level uncertainty in renewable\nenergy dispatch and load consumptions.

The\nbiologically and medically vital process of a cell assuming a functionally\nimportant fate from a range of phenotypic possibilities can be thought of as a\ncell decision. To make these decisions, a cell relies on energy dependent\npathways of signalling and expression. However, energy availability is often\noverlooked as a modulator of cellular decision-making. As cells can vary\ndramatically in energy availability, this limits our knowledge of how this key\nbiological axis affects cell behaviour. Here, we consider the energy dependence\nof a highly generalisable decision-making regulatory network, and show that\nenergy variability changes the sets of decisions a cell can make and the ease\nwith which they can be made. Increasing intracellular energy levels can\nincrease the number of stable phenotypes it can generate, corresponding to\nincreased decision-making capacity. For this decision-making architecture, a\ncell with intracellular energy below a threshold is limited to a singular\nphenotype, potentially forcing the adoption of a specific cell fate. We suggest\nthat common energetic differences between cells may explain some of the\nobserved variability in cellular decision-making, and demonstrate the\nimportance of considering energy levels in several diverse biological\ndecision-making phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 16:34:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-16"}

The\nonly potential cues available in the images were generated by the specific\nlocal combinations of color and luminance contrast. It is shown that response\nprobabilities for subjective depth and subjective size are systematically and\nconsistently determined by local surface colors and their immediate\nbackgrounds. There is a statistically significant correlation between\nsubjective depth and subjective size, and a color specific effect on both\ndependent variables. This effect depends on the polarity of the immediate\nsurround of the reference surface rather than on local center-surround contrast\nintensity. It is suggested that the underlying neural mechanisms selectively\nexploit specific color and background cues to enable intrinsically coherent\nperceptual organization of ambiguous image input.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 17:18:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-16"}

We quantify and model the offset distributions between\nobservationally-motivated centres and the `true' centre of the cluster, which\nis taken to be the most gravitationally bound particle measured in the\nsimulation. We fit the cumulative distribution function of offsets with an\nexponential distribution and a Gamma distribution fit well with most of the\ncentroid definitions. The galaxy-based centres can be seen to be divided into a\nmis-centred group and a well-centred group, with the well-centred group making\nup about $60\\%$ of all the clusters. Gas-based centres are overall less\nscattered than galaxy-based centres. We also find a cluster-mass dependence of\nthe offset distribution of gas-based centres, with generally larger offsets for\nsmaller mass clusters. We then measure cluster density profiles centred at each\nchoice of the centres and fit them with empirical models. Stacked, mis-centred\ndensity profiles fit to the Navarro-Frenk-White dark-matter profile and\nKomatsu-Seljak gas profile show that recovered shape and size parameters can\nsignificantly deviate from the true values. For the galaxy-based centres, this\ncan lead to cluster masses being underestimated by up to $10\\%$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 19:00:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 17:45:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

Precision medicine offers potential to improve patient\noutcomes by leveraging this heterogeneity. Individualized treatment rules\n(ITRs) formalize precision medicine as maps from the patient covariate space\ninto the space of allowable treatments. The optimal ITR is that which maximizes\nthe mean of a clinical outcome in a population of interest. Patient-derived\nxenograft (PDX) studies permit the evaluation of multiple treatments within a\nsingle tumor and thus are ideally suited for estimating optimal ITRs. PDX data\nare characterized by correlated outcomes, a high-dimensional feature space, and\na large number of treatments. Existing methods for estimating optimal ITRs do\nnot take advantage of the unique structure of PDX data or handle the associated\nchallenges well. In this paper, we explore machine learning methods for\nestimating optimal ITRs from PDX data.

While numerous models\nhave been proposed, including the liquid-liquid critical point, the\nsingularity-free scenario, and the stability limit conjecture, a\nmolecular-level understanding remains elusive.The main difficulty in\ndetermining which, if any, of these models is correct is the limited amount of\ndata in the relevant temperature and pressure ranges. For water at ambient\npressures, which is the focus of this work, data is largely missing from 160 -\n232 K due to rapid crystallization. Whether rapid crystallization is just an\nexperimental obstacle, or a fundamental problem signaling the inability of\nwater to thermally equilibrate prior to crystallization is also a major\nunanswered question. Here, we investigate the structural transformations of\ntransiently-heated, supercooled water with nanosecond time resolution using\ninfrared vibrational spectroscopy.

First, water's structure relaxes from its initial configuration to a\n\"steady-state\" configuration prior to the onset of crystallization over a wide\ntemperature range. Second, water's steady-state structure can be reproduced by\na linear combination of two, temperature-independent structures that correspond\nto a \"high-temperature liquid\" and a \"low-temperature liquid.\" Third, the\nobserved structural changes are reversible over the full temperature range.\nTaken together, these results show that supercooled water can equilibrate prior\nto crystallization for temperatures from the homogeneous nucleation temperature\ndown to the glass transition temperature.

We simplify this\ntheory for the case of wall-bounded flows by appealing to the Kuz'min\n(1983)-Oseledets (1989) representation of Navier-Stokes dynamics, in terms of\nthe vortex-momentum density associated to a continuous distribution of\ninfinitesimal vortex rings.

If this DM field couples to the Standard\nModel, its interaction with matter can be thought of as changing the effective\nvalues of fundamental constants.

This work builds on the dynamical selection\nmechanism for vacua based on search optimization proposed recently by the\nauthor and Parrikar. The approach is motivated by the possibility that eternal\ninflation has unfolded for a finite time much shorter than the exponentially\nlong mixing time for the landscape. The proposed accessibility measure assigns\ngreater weight to vacua that are accessed efficiently under time evolution. It\nis the analogue of the closeness centrality index widely used in network\nscience. The proposed measure enjoys a number of desirable properties. It is\nsimultaneously time-reparametrization invariant, independent of initial\nconditions, and oblivious to physical vs comoving weighing of pocket universes.\nImportantly, the proposed measure makes concrete and testable predictions that\nare largely independent of anthropic reasoning. Firstly, it favors vacua\nresiding in regions of the landscape with funnel-like topography, akin to the\nenergy landscape of naturally-occurring proteins. Secondly, it favors regions\nof the landscape that are tuned at dynamical criticality, with vacua having an\naverage lifetime of order the de Sitter Page time. Thus the predicted lifetime\nof our universe is of order its Page time, $\\sim 10^{130}$ years, which is\ncompatible with Standard Model estimates for electroweak metastability.\nRelatedly, the supersymmetry breaking scale should be high, at least $10^{10}$\nGeV. The discovery of beyond-the-Standard Model particles at the Large Hadron\nCollider or future accelerators, including low-scale supersymmetry, would rule\nout the possibility that our vacuum lies in an optimal region of the landscape.\nThe present framework suggests a correspondence between the near-criticality of\nour universe and dynamical critical phenomena on the string landscape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 21:01:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 20:05:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

The representation of the opinions as a graph induces a\ndistance between opinions which we use to measure disagreements.

Normally QHPT states occur only at\nisolated energies; accessing them therefore requires fine-tuning of the\nelectron density or magnetic field.

Spectrum-wide criticality is diagnosed by comparing\nnumerics to universal results for the longitudinal Landauer conductance and\nwave function multifractality at the QHPT.

Our approach has three modeling layers or\ncomponents. In the first layer, we utilize an intrusive projection approach to\nmodel dynamics represented by the largest modes. The second layer consists of\nan LSTM model to account for residuals beyond this truncation. This closure\nlayer refers to the process of including the residual effect of the discarded\nmodes into the dynamics of the largest scales. However, the feasibility of\ngenerating a low rank approximation tails off for higher Kolmogorov $n$-width\nsystems due to the underlying nonlinear processes. The third uplifting layer,\ncalled super-resolution, addresses this limited representation issue by\nexpanding the span into a larger number of modes utilizing the versatility of\nLSTM. Therefore, our model integrates a physics-based projection model with a\nmemory embedded LSTM closure and an LSTM based super-resolution model. In\nseveral applications, we exploit the use of Grassmann manifold to construct\nUROM for unseen conditions.

Over the past decade, several\ncomputer vision-based gait recognition approaches have been proposed in which\nwalking information corresponding to a complete gait cycle has been used to\nconstruct gait features for person identification. These methods compute gait\nfeatures with the inherent assumption that a complete gait cycle is always\navailable. However, in most public places occlusion is an inevitable\noccurrence, and due to this, only a fraction of a gait cycle gets captured by\nthe monitoring camera. Unavailability of complete gait cycle information\ndrastically affects the accuracy of the extracted features, and till date, only\na few occlusion handling strategies to gait recognition have been proposed. But\nnone of these performs reliably and robustly in the presence of a single cycle\nwith incomplete information, and because of this practical application of gait\nrecognition is quite limited. In this work, we develop deep learning-based\nalgorithm to accurately identify the affected frames as well as predict the\nmissing frames to reconstruct a complete gait cycle. While occlusion detection\nhas been carried out by employing a VGG-16 model, the model for frame\nreconstruction is based on Long-Short Term Memory network that has been trained\nto optimize a multi-objective function based on dice coefficient and\ncross-entropy loss. The effectiveness of the proposed occlusion reconstruction\nalgorithm is evaluated by computing the accuracy of the popular Gait Energy\nFeature on the reconstructed sequence.

We measure a secondary eclipse depth of $470^{+130}_{-110}$ ppm\nand detect a strong atmospheric brightness modulation signal with a\nsemi-amplitude of $319\\pm51$ ppm. No significant offset is detected between the\nsubstellar point and the region of maximum brightness on the dayside. There is\nalso no significant nightside flux detected, which is in agreement with the\nnightside effective blackbody temperature of $1090^{+190}_{-250}$ derived from\nthe published $Spitzer$ phase curves for this planet. Placing the eclipse depth\nmeasured in the $TESS$ bandpass alongside the large body of previous values\nfrom the literature, we carry out the first atmospheric retrievals of\nWASP-19b's secondary eclipse spectrum using the SCARLET code.

This is similar to the\ncompeting endogenous RNA (ceRNA) effect wherein the competition to bind to the\nsame pool of miRNA in Eukaryotes leads to miRNA mediated crosstalk resulting in\nsubtle and complex gene regulation with stabilised gene expression. We study an\nsRNA-driven feedforward loop (sFFL) where the top-tier regulator, an sRNA\n(RprA), translationally activates the target protein (RicI) directly and also,\nindirectly, via up-regulation of its transcriptional activator (RpoS/sigma^s).\nWe show that the sRNA-mediated crosstalk between the two mRNA species leads to\nmaximum target protein synthesis for low synthesis rates of RpoS-mRNA. This\nindicates the possibility of an optimal target protein synthesis with efficient\nutilisation of RpoS-mRNA which is typically associated with various other\nstress response activities inside the cell. Since gene expression is inherently\nstochastic due to the probabilistic nature of various molecular interactions\nassociated with it, we next quantify the fluctuations in the target protein\nlevel using generating function-based approach and stochastic simulations. The\ncoefficient of variation that provides a measure of fluctuations in the\nconcentration shows a minimum under conditions that also correspond to optimal\ntarget protein synthesis.

For a given\nposterior, this bound captures the trade off between averaged empirical risk\nand KL-divergence based model complexity term. Our goal is to identify an\noptimal posterior with the least PAC-Bayesian bound. We consider a finite\nclassifier set and 5 distance functions: KL-divergence, its Pinsker's and a\nsixth degree polynomial approximations; linear and squared distances. Linear\ndistance based model results in a convex optimization problem. We obtain closed\nform expression for its optimal posterior. For uniform prior, this posterior\nhas full support with weights negative-exponentially proportional to number of\nmisclassifications. Squared distance and Pinsker's approximation bounds are\npossibly quasi-convex and are observed to have single local minimum. We derive\nfixed point equations (FPEs) using partial KKT system with strict positivity\nconstraints. This obviates the combinatorial search for subset support of the\noptimal posterior. For uniform prior, exponential search on a full-dimensional\nsimplex can be limited to an ordered subset of classifiers with increasing\nempirical risk values. These FPEs converge rapidly to a stationary point, even\nfor a large classifier set when a solver fails. We apply these approaches to\nSVMs generated using a finite set of SVM regularization parameter values on 9\nUCI datasets. These posteriors yield stochastic SVM classifiers with tight\nbounds.

In this work we tackle the\nissue of interfering tasks through a comprehensive analysis of their training,\nderived from looking at the interaction between gradients within their shared\nparameters. Our empirical results show that well-performing models have low\nvariance in the angles between task gradients and that popular regularization\nmethods implicitly reduce this measure. Based on this observation, we propose a\nnovel gradient regularization term that minimizes task interference by\nenforcing near orthogonal gradients. Updating the shared parameters using this\nproperty encourages task specific decoders to optimize different parts of the\nfeature extractor, thus reducing competition. We evaluate our method with\nclassification and regression tasks on the multiDigitMNIST, NYUv2 and SUN RGB-D\ndatasets where we obtain competitive results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2019 13:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

The observed metallicity distribution of the inner-halo stars deviates\nfrom the traditional single-peaked distribution, and exhibits complex\nsubstructures comprising varying contributions from individual stellar\npopulations, sometimes with striking double peaks at low metallicities. The\nsubstructures revealed from our less-biased, comprehensive maps demonstrate the\nclear advantages of this approach, which can be built upon by future mixed-band\nand broad-band photometric surveys, and used as a blueprint for identifying the\nstars of greatest interest for upcoming spectroscopic studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2019 13:49:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 04:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

By studying the populations of\nSB2 in the 30 Doradus region, we found a subset of them that have photometry\nfrom the OGLE project and that display variations in their light curves related\nto orbital motions. The goal of this study is to determine the dynamical masses\nand radii of the 26 binary components to investigate the mass-discrepancy\nproblem and to provide an empirical mass-luminosity relation for the LMC. We\nuse the PHOEBE programme to perform a systematic analysis of the OGLE V and I\nlight curves obtained for 13 binary systems in 30 Dor. We adopt Teff, and\norbital parameters derived previously to obtain the inclinations of the systems\nand the parameters of the individual components. Three systems display eclipses\nin their light curves, while the others only display ellipsoidal variations. We\nclassify two systems as over-contact, five as semi-detached, and four as\ndetached. The two remaining systems have uncertain configurations due to large\nuncertainties on their inclinations. The fact that systems display ellipsoidal\nvariations has a significant impact on the inclination errors. From the\ndynamical masses, luminosities, and radii, we provide LMC-based empirical\nmass-luminosity and mass-radius relations, and we compare them to other\nrelations given for the Galaxy, the LMC, and the SMC. These relations differ\nfor different mass ranges, but do not seem to depend on the metallicity\nregimes. We also compare the dynamical, spectroscopic, and evolutionary masses\nof the stars in our sample. While the dynamical and spectroscopic masses agree\nwith each other, the evolutionary masses are systematically higher, at least\nfor stars in semi-detached systems. This suggests that the mass discrepancy can\nbe partly explained by past or ongoing interactions between the stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2019 14:21:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Depending on\nexternal conditions, different drag mechanisms are activated that govern the\ndynamics of dislocations in their own way. This is revealed by the resultant\nspeed of the dislocation. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework that\ngenerally describes the dynamic drag on dislocations and, as a result, derive a\nphenomenological constitutive equation. Furthermore, given that a low-angle\ngrain boundary (LAGB) can be regarded as an array of dislocations, we extend\nthe model to describe the mobility law of LAGBs as a function of misorientation\nangle.

With perfect\ninput knowledge, we show that Longest Processing Time First (LPT) algorithm is\ntightly 2-approximate. After proving that the problem is strongly NP-hard even\nwhen g=1, we elaborate on improving the 2-approximation ratio for this case. We\ndistinguish the classes of long and short instances satisfying p_j>=m and\np_j<m, respectively, for each job j. We show that LPT is 5/3-approximate for\nthe former and optimal for the latter. Then, we explore scheduling long jobs in\nparallel with short jobs to obtain tightly satisfied packing and bounded job\nstart constraints. For a broad family of instances excluding degenerate\ninstances with many very long jobs, we derive a 1.985-approximation ratio. For\ngeneral instances, we require machine augmentation to obtain better than\n2-approximate schedules.

A number of\nrecent studies have shown subpulse drifting to exhibit very specific physical\ncharacteristics : i) drifting is seen only in conal components of the pulse\nprofile and is absent in central core emission; ii) drifting pulsars are\ndistributed over a narrow range of spin-down energy loss ($\\dot{E}$), where\npulsars with $\\dot{E} < 2\\times$10$^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ show this behaviour,\niii) drifting periodicity ($P_3$) is anti-correlated with $\\dot{E}$, such that\npulsars with lower values of $\\dot{E}$ tend to have longer $P_3$.

For this setup, we focus on analyzing and comparing the\nperformance of two spectrum sharing mechanisms: (i) underlay, where the same\ntime-frequency resources may be accessed by both UAVs and GUEs, resulting in\nmutual interference, and (ii)overlay, where the available resources are divided\ninto orthogonal portions for U2U and GUE communications. We evaluate the\ncoverage probability and rate of both link types and their interplay to\nidentify the best spectrum sharing strategy. We do so through an analytical\nframework that embraces realistic height-dependent channel models, antenna\npatterns, and practical power control mechanisms. For the underlay, we find\nthat although the presence of U2U direct communications may worsen the uplink\nperformance of GUEs, such effect is limited as base stations receive the\npower-constrained UAV signals through their antenna sidelobes. In spite of\nthis, our results lead us to conclude that in urban scenarios with a large\nnumber of UAV pairs, adopting an overlay spectrum sharing seems the most\nsuitable approach for maintaining a minimum guaranteed rate for UAVs and a high\nGUE UL performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 16:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

We have undertaken a similar analysis for 61\nB-type similar targets, towards the young cluster, NGC 346 in the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC). Approximately 65% could have nitrogen enhancements of\nless than 0.3 dex, consistent with them having experienced only small amounts\nof mixing due to their low rotational velocities. However as with the previous\nLMC surveys, an excess of stars with low projected rotational velocities,\nvsini<40 km/s and significant nitrogen enrichments is found. This is estimated\nto be approximately 5% of the total population of apparently single B-type\nstars or 40% of all stars with current rotational velocities of less than 40\nkm/s. For all three surveys, the presence of undetected binaries and other\nuncertainties imply that these percentages might be underestimated and indeed\nit is possible that all single stars with current rotational velocities of less\nthan 40 km/s are nitrogen enriched. Possible explanations incorporate the\neffects of magnetic fields, via either a stellar merger followed by magnetic\nbreaking or the evolution of a single star with a large magnetic field. Both\nmechanisms are compatible with the observed frequency of nitrogen-enriched\nstars in the Magellanic Clouds. Differences in the properties of the\nnitrogen-enriched stars compared with the remainder of the sample would be\nconsistent with the former mechanism.

They exhibit higher\nnitrogen content at their surface and rotate more slowly than their companions.\nBy accreting new material, their companions spin faster and are rejuvenated.\nTheir locations in the N-vsini diagram tend to show that binary products are\ngood candidates to populate the two groups of stars (slowly rotating,\nnitrogen-enriched and rapidly rotating non-enriched) that cannot be reproduced\nthrough single-star population synthesis. This sample is the largest sample of\nbinaries to be studied in such a homogeneous way. The study of these objects\ngives us strong observational constraints to test theoretical binary\nevolutionary tracks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2019 13:36:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

The typical switchback\nrotation angle increased with radial distance. Significant Poynting fluxes\nexisted inside, but not outside, switchbacks and they are related to the\nincreased EXB/B2 flow caused by the magnetic field rotating to become more\nperpendicular to the flow direction. (Outside the switchbacks, the magnetic\nfield and solar wind flow were generally radial.) The solar wind flow inside\nswitchbacks was faster than that outside due to the frozen-in ions moving with\nthe magnetic structure at the Alfven speed. This energy gain results from the\ndivergence of the Poynting flux from outside to inside the switchback, which\nproduces a loss of electromagnetic energy on switchback entry and recovery of\nthat energy on exit, with the lost energy appearing in the plasma flow.\nSwitchbacks contain 0.3-10 Hz waves that may result from currents and the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability that occurs at the switchback boundaries.
