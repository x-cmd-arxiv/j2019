The programmer\nfriendliness, however, can come at the cost of substantial performance\npenalties. This is especially true when indirectly indexing the elements of a\nshared array, for which the induced between-thread data communication can be\nirregular and have a fine-grained pattern. In this paper we study performance\nenhancement strategies specifically targeting such fine-grained irregular\ncommunication in UPC. Starting from explicit thread privatization, continuing\nwith block-wise communication, and arriving at message condensing and\nconsolidation, we obtained considerable performance improvement of UPC programs\nthat originally require fine-grained irregular communication. Besides the\nperformance enhancement strategies, the main contribution of the present paper\nis to propose performance models for the different scenarios, in form of\nquantifiable formulas that hinge on the actual volumes of various data\nmovements plus a small number of easily obtainable hardware characteristic\nparameters. These performance models help to verify the enhancements obtained,\nwhile also providing insightful predictions of similar parallel\nimplementations, not limited to UPC, that also involve between-thread or\nbetween-process irregular communication. As a further validation, we also apply\nour performance modeling methodology and hardware characteristic parameters to\nan existing UPC code for solving a 2D heat equation on a uniform mesh.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Dec 2019 17:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

In the particular scenario of\nkernel machines, context-aware kernel design aims at learning positive\nsemi-definite similarity functions which return high values not only when data\nshare similar contents, but also similar structures (a.k.a contexts). However,\nthe use of context in kernel design has not been fully explored; indeed,\ncontext in these solutions is handcrafted instead of being learned. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel deep network architecture that learns context in\nkernel design.

This natural problem, often referred\nto as influence estimation, boils down to computing the marginal probability\nthat a given node is active at a given time when the process starts from\nspecified initial condition. Among many other applications, this task is\ncrucial for a well-studied problem of influence maximization: finding optimal\nspreaders in a social network that maximize the influence spread by a certain\ntime horizon. Indeed, influence estimation needs to be called multiple times\nfor comparing candidate seed sets. Unfortunately, in many models of interest an\nexact computation of marginals is #P-hard. In practice, influence is often\nestimated using Monte-Carlo sampling methods that require a large number of\nruns for obtaining a high-fidelity prediction, especially at large times.

The method hinges upon the eigenanalysis of missing\nvariables sampled as augmented data; the augmented data approach was introduced\nby Albert's seminal work applying Gibbs sampling to Item Response Theory in\n1992. Similar to maximum likelihood factor analysis, the factor structure in\nthis Bayesian approach depends only on sufficient statistics, which are\ncomputed from the missing latent data. A second feature of the SAEM algorithm\nis the use of the Robbins-Monro procedure for establishing convergence.\nContrary to Expectation Maximization methods where costly integrals must be\ncalculated, this method is well-suited for highly multidimensional data, and an\nannealing method is implemented to prevent convergence to a local maximum\nlikelihood. Multiple calculations of errors applied within this framework of\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo are presented to delineate the uncertainty of\nparameter estimates. Given the nature of EFA (exploratory factor analysis), an\nalgorithm is formalized leveraging the Tracy-Widom distribution for the\nretention of factors extracted from an eigenanalysis of the sufficient\nstatistic of the covariance of the augmented data matrix. Simulation conditions\nof dichotomous and polytomous data, from one to ten dimensions of factor\nloadings, are used to assess statistical accuracy and to gauge computational\ntime of the EFA approach of this IRT-specific implementation of the SAEM\nalgorithm. Finally, three applications of this methodology are also reported\nthat demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for enabling timely analyses\nas well as substantive interpretations when this method is applied to real\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Dec 2019 23:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

Existing methods strive to\norganize the points regularly, e.g. voxelize, pass them through a designed\n2D/3D neural network, and then define object-level anchors that predict offsets\nof 3D bounding boxes using collective evidences from all the points on the\nobjects of interest. Contrary to the state-of-the-art anchor-based methods,\nbased on the very nature of data sparsity, we observe that even points on an\nindividual object part are informative about semantic information of the\nobject. We thus argue in this paper for an approach opposite to existing\nmethods using object-level anchors. Inspired by compositional models, which\nrepresent an object as parts and their spatial relations, we propose to\nrepresent an object as composition of its interior non-empty voxels, termed\nhotspots, and the spatial relations of hotspots. This gives rise to the\nrepresentation of Object as Hotspots (OHS). Based on OHS, we further propose an\nanchor-free detection head with a novel ground truth assignment strategy that\ndeals with inter-object point-sparsity imbalance to prevent the network from\nbiasing towards objects with more points. Experimental results show that our\nproposed method works remarkably well on objects with a small number of points.\nNotably, our approach ranked 1st on KITTI 3D Detection Benchmark for cyclist\nand pedestrian detection, and achieved state-of-the-art performance on NuScenes\n3D Detection Benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 03:02:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 2020 01:11:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 05:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

Recently, there has been a shift from the classical minimum free\nenergy-based methods (MFE) to partition function-based ones that assemble\nstructures using base-pairing probabilities. Two examples of the latter group\nare the popular maximum expected accuracy (MEA) method and the ProbKnot method.\nProbKnot is a fast heuristic that pairs nucleotides that are reciprocally most\nprobable pairing partners, and unlike MEA, can also predict structures with\npseudoknots. However, ProbKnot's full potential has been largely overlooked. In\nparticular, when introduced, it did not have an MEA-like hyperparameter that\ncan balance between positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity. We show\nthat a simple thresholded version of ProbKnot, which we call ThreshKnot, leads\nto more accurate overall predictions by filtering out unlikely pairs whose\nprobabilities fall under a given threshold. We also show that on three\nwidely-used folding engines (RNAstructure, Vienna RNAfold, and CONTRAfold),\nThreshKnot always outperforms the much more involved MEA algorithm in (1) its\nhigher structure prediction accuracy, (2) its capability to predict\npseudoknots, and (3) its faster runtime and easier implementation. This\nsuggests that ThreshKnot should replace MEA as the default partition\nfunction-based structure prediction algorithm.

The key idea of the proposed SSMP\nalgorithm is to sequentially investigate the support of jointly sparse vectors\nto minimize the subspace distance to the residual space. Our performance\nguarantee analysis indicates that SSMP accurately reconstructs any row\n$K$-sparse matrix of rank $r$ in the full row rank scenario if the sampling\nmatrix $\\mathbf{A}$ satisfies $\\text{krank}(\\mathbf{A}) \\ge K+1$, which meets\nthe fundamental minimum requirement on $\\mathbf{A}$ to ensure exact recovery.\nWe also show that SSMP guarantees exact reconstruction in at most $K-r+\\lceil\n\\frac{r}{L} \\rceil$ iterations, provided that $\\mathbf{A}$ satisfies the\nrestricted isometry property (RIP) of order $L(K-r)+r+1$ with\n$$\\delta_{L(K-r)+r+1} < \\max \\left \\{\n\\frac{\\sqrt{r}}{\\sqrt{K+\\frac{r}{4}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{r}{4}}},\n\\frac{\\sqrt{L}}{\\sqrt{K}+1.15 \\sqrt{L}} \\right \\},$$ where $L$ is the number of\nindices chosen in each iteration.

Continual\nsynchronization between sub-models allows for trajectory predictions with\nsuperior accuracy compared to a single model or a classical ensemble of\nindependent models whose decision fusion is based on the majority voting or\naveraging the outcomes.

Their\neffectiveness and efficiency are limited by the sequential and separate\narchitecture. In this paper, we propose a Parallel Point Detection and Matching\n(PPDM) HOI detection framework. In PPDM, an HOI is defined as a point triplet <\nhuman point, interaction point, object point>. Human and object points are the\ncenter of the detection boxes, and the interaction point is the midpoint of the\nhuman and object points. PPDM contains two parallel branches, namely point\ndetection branch and point matching branch. The point detection branch predicts\nthree points. Simultaneously, the point matching branch predicts two\ndisplacements from the interaction point to its corresponding human and object\npoints. The human point and the object point originated from the same\ninteraction point are considered as matched pairs. In our novel parallel\narchitecture, the interaction points implicitly provide context and\nregularization for human and object detection. The isolated detection boxes are\nunlikely to form meaning HOI triplets are suppressed, which increases the\nprecision of HOI detection. Moreover, the matching between human and object\ndetection boxes is only applied around limited numbers of filtered candidate\ninteraction points, which saves much computational cost.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nproblem setting to allow MCLs for each example and two ways for learning with\nMCLs. In the first way, we design two wrappers that decompose MCLs into many\nsingle CLs, so that we could use any method for learning with CLs. However, the\nsupervision information that MCLs hold is conceptually diluted after\ndecomposition. Thus, in the second way, we derive an unbiased risk estimator;\nminimizing it processes each set of MCLs as a whole and possesses an estimation\nerror bound. We further improve the second way into minimizing properly chosen\nupper bounds.

The fundamental difficulty lies in understanding the\nstructure of the observed stochastic process. In this paper, we show that every\nuniformly-positive-definite-in-covariance and sufficiently short-range\ndependent non-stationary and nonlinear time series can be well approximated\nglobally by an auto-regressive process of slowly diverging order. When linear\nprediction with ${\\cal L}^2$ loss is concerned, the latter result facilitates a\nunified globally-optimal short-term forecasting theory for a wide class of\nlocally stationary time series asymptotically. A nonparametric sieve method is\nproposed to globally and adaptively estimate the optimal forecasting\ncoefficient functions and the associated mean squared error of forecast. An\nadaptive stability test is proposed to check whether the optimal forecasting\ncoefficients are time-varying, a frequently-encountered question for\npractitioners and researchers of time series. Furthermore, partial\nauto-correlation functions (PACF) of general non-stationary time series are\nstudied and used as a visual tool to explore the linear dependence structure of\nsuch series. We use extensive numerical simulations and two real data examples\nto illustrate the usefulness of our results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 14:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

In particular, we can completely eliminate the\nambiguity issues if formations are under a specific construction which is\ncalled \\myemph{signed Henneberg construction} in this paper. We then apply the\nrigidity theory to formation shape control and develop a gradient-based control\nsystem that guarantees an exponential convergence close to a desired formation\nby inter-neighbor measurements. Several numerical simulations on formation\nshape control with hybrid distance-angle constraints are provided to validate\nthe theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 15:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

A key question arises due to the possibility of fermion\nprofile discontinuities at the Higgs boundary: how to calculate rigorously the\nfermion mass spectrum and effective four-dimensional (4D) Yukawa couplings? We\nshow that the proper treatment, leading to physically consistent solutions,\ndoes not rely on any Higgs peak regularisation but requires the presence of\ncertain Bilinear Brane Terms (BBT). In particular, no profile jump should\nappear and the Higgs regularisations turn out to suffer from mathematical\ndiscrepancies reflected in two non-commutativities of calculation steps debated\nin the literature. The introduction of BBT can by replaced by vanishing\nconditions for probability currents at the considered flat interval boundaries.\nBoth contribute to the definition of the field geometrical configuration of the\nmodel, even in the free case. The BBT could allow to elaborate an ultra-violet\norigin of the chiral nature of the Standard Model and of its chirality\ndistribution among quarks/leptons. The current conditions are implemented via\nessential boundary conditions to be contrasted with the natural boundary\nconditions derived from the action variation. All these theoretical conclusions\nare confirmed in particular by the converging exact results of the 4D versus 5D\napproaches. The analysis is completed by a description of the appropriate\nenergy cut-off procedure. The new calculation methods presented, implying the\nindependence of excited fermion masses and 4D Yukawa couplings on the\n'wrong-chirality' Yukawa terms, have impacts on phenomenological results like\nthe relaxing of previously obtained strong bounds on Kaluza-Klein masses\ninduced by flavour changing reactions generated through exchanges of the Higgs\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 15:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

Many successful theorem provers employ a portfolio\nof different methods for solving problems. This changes the landscape on which\nwe perform our research: solving problems that can already be solved may not\nimprove the state of the art and a method that can solve a handful of problems\nunsolvable by current methods, but generally performs poorly on most problems,\ncan be very useful.

We propose a\nmovement towards focussing on unique solutions in evaluation and competitions\ni.e. measuring the potential contribution to a portfolio solver. This state of\naffairs is particularly prominent in first-order logic, which is undecidable.\nWhen reasoning in a decidable logic there can be a focus on optimising a\ndecision procedure and measuring average solving times. But in a setting where\nsolutions are difficult to find, average solving times lose meaning, and whilst\nimproving the efficiency of a technique can move potential solutions within\nacceptable time limits, in general, complementary strategies may be more\nsuccessful.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 15:14:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

To address the human\nintelligence limitations in discovering reduced-order models, we propose to\nsupplement human thinking with artificial intelligence. Our three-pronged\nstrategy consists of learning (i) models expressed in analytical form, (ii)\nwhich are evaluated a posteriori, and iii) using exclusively integral\nquantities from the reference solution as prior knowledge. In point (i), we\npursue interpretable models expressed symbolically as opposed to black-box\nneural networks, the latter only being used during learning to efficiently\nparameterize the large search space of possible models. In point (ii), learned\nmodels are dynamically evaluated a posteriori in the computational solver\ninstead of based on a priori information from preprocessed high-fidelity data,\nthereby accounting for the specificity of the solver at hand such as its\nnumerics. Finally in point (iii), the exploration of new models is solely\nguided by predefined integral quantities, e.g., averaged quantities of\nengineering interest in Reynolds-averaged or large-eddy simulations (LES). We\nuse a coupled deep reinforcement learning framework and computational solver to\nconcurrently achieve these objectives.

Thinner films, as predicted and also\nconfirmed by atomistic simulations, exhibited more 4 coordinated alumina sites.\nThese atomistic alterations were expected to change the amorphous thin film\naverage density. The density indeed varied with the alumina layer thickness,\nand the measured effect was even stronger than predicted theoretically. This\neffect is explained in terms of the deposition process, where each newly\ndeposited layer is a new surface layer that remembers its structure, resulting\nin thin films of substantially lower density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 08:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-13"}

The\nligament size is usually considered as the only parameter controlling thermal\nstability and mechanical properties of nanoporous gold. Recently we developed a\nmethod for creating nanoporous single crystal gold particles using eutectic\ndecomposition of Au-Ge, followed by selective etching of Ge. Here, we used this\nnovel method to create nanoporous gold particles with controlled ligament sizes\nby changing the initial sample relative concentrations of gold and germanium.\nWhen investigated from 1 to 4 hour at 250 to 400 degrees C the material was\nthermally stable up to 350 degrees C, which is higher than the thermal\nstability of classical nanoporous gold with similar ligament sizes prepared by\ndealloying. Mechanical properties were examined utilizing nanoindentation of\nnanoporous gold before and after annealing. For smaller ligament sizes,\nhardness increases with annealing temperature up to 300 degrees C and then\nstrongly decreases. For larger ligament sizes, hardness decreases with\nincreasing annealing temperature. Young modulus was unchanged up to 300 degrees\nC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 08:39:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-13"}

Here we describe a complementary way of approaching\nthis problem. Our strategy is based on the observation that two large classes\nof biophysical models of cis-regulatory mechanisms can be expressed as deep\nneural networks in which nodes and weights have explicit physiochemical\ninterpretations. We also demonstrate how such biophysical networks can be\nrapidly inferred, using modern deep learning frameworks, from the data produced\nby certain types of massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs).
