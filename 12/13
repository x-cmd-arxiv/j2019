We study such a lattice action, with O($N_h$)\nglobal symmetry, in an analytic large $N_h$ expansion and by Monte Carlo\nsimulations for $N_h=4$ and find consistent results. We find a confining phase\nwith O($N_h$) symmetry preserved (this describes the Fermi liquid phase in the\ncuprates), and Higgs phases (describing the pseudogap phase of the cuprates)\nwith different patterns of the broken global O($N_h$) symmetry. One of the\nHiggs phases is topologically trivial, implying the absence of any excitations\nwith residual gauge charges. The other Higgs phase has $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\ntopological order, with `vison' excitations carrying a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge\ncharge. We find consistent regimes of stability for the topological Higgs phase\nin both our numerical and analytical analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 18:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

One such\nanalogue, due to Cushen and Hudson, is of particular relevance for quantum\noptics. It implies that the state in any single output arm of an $n$-splitter,\nwhich is fed with $n$ copies of a centred state $\\rho$ with finite second\nmoments, converges to the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments\nas $\\rho$. Here we exploit the phase space formalism to carry out a refined\nanalysis of the rate of convergence in this quantum central limit theorem. For\ninstance, we prove that the convergence takes place at a rate\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{-1/2}\\right)$ in the Hilbert--Schmidt norm whenever the\nthird moments of $\\rho$ are finite. Trace norm or relative entropy bounds can\nbe obtained by leveraging the energy boundedness of the state. Via analytical\nand numerical examples we show that our results are tight in many respects. An\nextension of our proof techniques to the non-i.i.d. setting is used to analyse\na new model of a lossy optical fibre, where a given $m$-mode state enters a\ncascade of $n$ beam splitters of equal transmissivities $\\lambda^{1/n}$ fed\nwith an arbitrary (but fixed) environment state. Assuming that the latter has\nfinite third moments, and ignoring unitaries, we show that the effective\nchannel converges in diamond norm to a simple thermal attenuator, with a rate\n$\\mathcal{O}\\Big(n^{-\\frac{1}{2(m+1)}}\\Big)$.

We find\ndistinct changes in the chemical potential and a rearrangement of the\nlow-energy excitations at each integer filling of the moir\\'e flat bands. These\nspectroscopic features are a direct consequence of Coulomb interactions, which\nsplit the degenerate flat bands into Hubbard sub-bands. We find these\ninteractions, the strength of which we can extract experimentally, to be\nsurprisingly sensitive to the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field, which\nstrongly modifies the spectroscopic transitions. The cascade of transitions we\nreport here characterizes the correlated high-temperature parent phase from\nwhich various insulating and superconducting ground-state phases emerge at low\ntemperatures in MATBG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 17:34:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-12"}

In this work we combine X-ray measurements of the mean black\nhole accretion luminosity as a function of stellar mass and redshift with\nempirical models of galaxy stellar mass growth, integrating over time to\npredict the evolving Mbh-Mstar relation. The implied relation is nearly\nindependent of redshift, indicating that stellar and black hole masses grow, on\naverage, at similar rates.

In this paper, we describe\nthe nature of such a singular response and show how it can be used to define a\nclass of operators acting as non-local order parameters. These operators\ncharacterize the Chern-insulator states in the following way: for a given\nstate, there exists a corresponding operator which has an algebraically\ndecaying two-point function in that particular state, while it decays\nexponentially in all other states. The behaviour of the order parameter is\ndefined only in terms of the electromagnetic response, and not from any\nmicroscopic properties, and we therefore claim to have found a generic order\nparameter for the Chern insulating states. We support this claim by numerically\nevaluating the order parameters for different insulating states. We also show\nhow our construction can be generalized to other states with topological\nelectromagnetic response, and use the states with a quantized magnetoelectric\neffect in three dimensions as an example. Besides providing novel insights into\ntopological states of matter, our construction can be exploited to efficiently\ndiagnose such states numerically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 19:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

Quantum emitters, such as\ncolor centers trapped in solids, are a useful platform for the realization of\nelementary building blocks (qubits) of quantum information systems. In\nparticular, the modular nature of such solid-state devices opens up the\npossibility to connect them into quantum networks and create non-classical\nstates of light shared among many qubits. The function of a quantum network\nrelies on efficient and controllable interactions among individual qubits. In\nthis context, we present a scheme where optically active qubits of differing\nexcitation energies are mutually coupled via a dispersive interaction with a\nshared mode of an optical cavity. This generally off-resonant interaction is\nprohibitive of direct exchange of information among the qubits. However, we\npropose a scheme in which by acoustically modulating the qubit excitation\nenergies it is in fact possible to tune to resonance a pre-selected pair of\nqubits and thus open a communication channel between them.

The considered highly nonlinear fibre structure is composed\nof a real, intentionally developed soft glass-pair with high refractive index\ncontrast at the level of 0.4 in the near infrared. Nonlinear propagation of\npicojoule level femtosecond pulses was studied numerically with the aim to\nidentify the best switching performance in input parameter space of 1400 - 1800\nnm in terms of excitation wavelengths, and of 75 - 150 fs in terms of pulse\nwidth, respectively. For every combination of excitation wavelength and pulse\nwidth, the switching energies together with the optimal fibre length were\ndetermined and their relation to the input and switching parameters is\ndiscussed. The highest switching contrast of 46 dB in the time window of the\nultrashort soliton was predicted at combination of 1500 nm excitation\nwavelength and 75 fs pulse width considering 43 mm fibre length. These results\nrepresent significant improvement both from point of view of switching contrast\nand switching energies, which are only at level of 20 pJ, in comparison to the\npreviously published case of air-glass dual-core photonic crystal fibre.\nMoreover, the simpler fibre design without cladding microstructure together\nwith the all-solid approach holds promise of improved dual-core symmetry and\ntherefore offers high probability of the successful realization of a low power,\ncompact and simple switching device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 19:33:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-16"}

Initial irradiation tests of a spare DT chamber at the\nCERN gamma irradiation facility (GIF++), at large ($\\sim$O(100)) acceleration\nfactor, showed ageing effects resulting in a degradation of the DT cell\nperformance. However, full CMS simulations have shown almost no impact in the\nmuon reconstruction efficiency over the full barrel acceptance and for the full\nintegrated luminosity. A second spare DT chamber was moved inside the GIF++\nbunker in October 2017. The chamber was being irradiated at lower acceleration\nfactors, and only 2 out of the 12 layers of the chamber were switched at\nworking voltage when the radioactive source was active, being the other layers\nin standby. In this way the other non-aged layers are used as reference and as\na precise and unbiased telescope of muon tracks for the efficiency computation\nof the aged layers of the chamber, when set at working voltage for\nmeasurements. An integrated dose equivalent to two times the expected\nintegrated luminosity of the HL-LHC run has been absorbed by this second spare\nDT chamber and the final impact on the muon reconstruction efficiency is under\nstudy. Direct inspection of some extracted aged anode wires presented a melted\nresistive deposition of materials. Investigation on the outgassing of cell\nmaterials and of the gas components used at the GIF++ are underway. Strategies\nto mitigate the ageing effects are also being developed. From the long\nirradiation measurements of the second spare DT chamber, the effects of\nradiation in the performance of the DTs expected during the HL-LHC run will be\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 19:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-16"}

The LG formulation uses the bulk\nmodulus B and its pressure derivative B' as fit parameters deduced directly\nfrom the equation of state, however, the results are not unique and strongly\ndepends on the chosen equation of state (EOS). By introducing a constraint that\nthe bulk moduli parameters B and B' must simultaneously obey the\nLindemann-Gilvarry criterion (LG) and the EOS, consistent bulk moduli are\nderived. The cold pressure Pc and the cold melting curve are obtained by\nintroducing an effective Gr\\\"uneisen parameter ($\\gamma$eff) to the LG\napproximated equation together with the above constraint. It is claimed that\nisochoric condition exists in diamond anvil cells (DAC), thus upon raising the\ntemperature and approaching the melt constant volume is maintained.

Are we simply\nreplacing one complex system (a biological circuit) with another (a deep\nnetwork), without understanding either? Moreover, beyond neural\nrepresentations, are the deep network's computational mechanisms for generating\nneural responses the same as those in the brain? Without a systematic approach\nto extracting and understanding computational mechanisms from deep neural\nnetwork models, it can be difficult both to assess the degree of utility of\ndeep learning approaches in neuroscience, and to extract experimentally\ntestable hypotheses from deep networks. We develop such a systematic approach\nby combining dimensionality reduction and modern attribution methods for\ndetermining the relative importance of interneurons for specific visual\ncomputations.

This reaction sensitively impacts the primordial\nabundances of $^{7}$Be and $^7$Li during big bang nucleosynthesis.

In the fitting of the data, we consistently\nmodel all known sources of uncertainty, including discrepant absolute\nnormalizations of different data sets, and also take the variation of the\nneutron and proton channel radii into account, hence providing less biased\nestimates of the $^7$Be(n,p)$^7$Li thermonuclear rates.

The proposed numerical approach reconstructs a smooth solution in a\nparallelogram that is enclosed by the quadrilateral formed by two adjacent\ntriangle elements. The interface between these two triangles is the diagonal of\nthe enclosed parallelogram. Similar to triangles, the mapping of parallelograms\nfrom a physical domain to a reference domain is an affine mapping, which is\nnecessary for an accurate and efficient implementation of the numerical\nalgorithm.

In this paper,\nwe aim at solving the fashion compatibility problem given specific themes. To\nthis end, we built the first real-world theme-aware fashion dataset comprising\n14K around outfits labeled with 32 themes. In this dataset, there are more than\n40K fashion items labeled with 152 fine-grained categories. We also propose an\nattention model learning fashion compatibility given a specific theme.

Thanks to\nstrong connections between fashion themes and categories, we then build a\ntheme-attention model over the category-specific embedding space. This model\nassociates themes with the pairwise compatibility with attention, and thus\ncompute the outfit-wise compatibility.

The\nthermodynamics of such cyclical non-equilibrium systems are well understood and\nrecent work has focused on the molecular mechanism of secondary active\ntransport. The fact that these transporters change their conformation between\nan inward-facing and outward-facing conformation in a cyclical fashion, called\nthe alternating access model, is broadly recognized as the molecular framework\nin which to describe transporter function. High resolution structures and\ndetailed computer simulations lead to the recognition of common molecular-level\nprinciples between disparate transporter families.

By reducing the pulse duration to 6 fs with only a few\noptical cycles, we also demonstrate that the enhancements are significantly\nreduced beyond what is measurable in the experiment. Comparing these to\nnumerical predictions, which are in quantitative agreement with experimental\nresults, we find that even though the quantum-state distribution can be broad,\nthe enhancements are largely due to efficient population of a select few AC\nStark-shifted resonant states rather than the closing of an ionization channel.\nBecause these resonances are dependent on the frequency and intensity of the\nlaser field, the broad bandwidth of the 6 fs pulses means that the resonance\ncondition is fulfilled across a large range of intensities. This is further\nexaggerated by volume-averaging effects, resulting in excitation of the $5g$\nstate at almost all intensities and reducing the apparent magnitude of the\nenhancements. For 30 fs pulses, volume averaging also broadens the quantum\nstate distribution but the enhancements are still large enough to survive. In\nthis case, selectivity of excitation to a single state is reduced below 25% of\nthe relative population. However, an analysis of TDSE simulations indicates\nthat excitation of up to 60% into a single state is possible if volume\naveraging can be eliminated and the intensity can be precisely controlled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 01:06:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 01:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

While there are studies proposed in terms of the\narchitecture design for UAV swarms, two main challenges still exist: (1)\nScalability, supporting a large scale of vehicles; (2) Versatility, integrating\ndiversified missions. To this end, a multi-layered and distributed architecture\nfor mission oriented miniature fixed-wing UAV swarms is presented in this\npaper. The proposed architecture is built on the concept of modularity. It\ndivides the overall system to five layers: low-level control, high-level\ncontrol, coordination, communication and human interaction layers, and many\nmodules that can be viewed as black boxes with interfaces of inputs and\noutputs. In this way, not only the complexity of developing a large system can\nbe reduced, but also the versatility of supporting diversified missions can be\nensured. Furthermore, the proposed architecture is fully distributed that each\nUAV performs the decision-making procedure autonomously so as to achieve better\nscalability. Moreover, different kinds of aerial platforms can be feasibly\nextended by using the control allocation matrices and the integrated hardware\nbox. A prototype swarm system based on the proposed architecture is built and\nthe proposed architecture is evaluated through field experiments with a scale\nof 21 fixed-wing UAVs. Particularly, to the best of our knowledge, this paper\nis the first work which successfully demonstrates formation flight, target\nrecognition and tracking missions within an integrated architecture for\nfixed-wing UAV swarms through field experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 01:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

In QCD, the ratio\nof these transport coefficients to entropy density, $\\zeta/s$ and $\\eta/s$,\ndepends non-trivially on the plasma's temperature.\n  Purpose: We show that in a 0+1D boost-invariant fluid, a\ntemperature-dependent $\\zeta/s(T)$ or $\\eta/s(T)$ can be described by an\nequivalent effective viscosity $\\left\\langle \\zeta/s\n\\right\\rangle_{\\textrm{eff}}$ or $\\left\\langle \\eta/s\n\\right\\rangle_{\\textrm{eff}}$. We extend the concept of effective viscosity in\nsystems with transverse expansion, and discuss how effective viscosities can be\nused to identify families of $\\zeta/s(T)$ and $\\eta/s(T)$ that lead to similar\nhydrodynamic evolution.\n  Results: In 0+1D, the effective viscosity is expressed as a simple integral\nof $\\zeta/s(T)$ or $\\eta/s(T)$ over temperature, with a weight determined by\nthe speed of sound of the fluid. The result is general for any equation of\nstate with a moderate temperature dependence of the speed of sound, including\nthe QCD equation of state. In 1+1D, a similar definition of effective viscosity\nis obtained in terms of characteristic trajectories in time and transverse\ndirection. This leads to an infinite number of constraints on an infinite\nfunctional space for $\\zeta/s(T)$ and $\\eta/s(T)$.\n  Conclusions: The definition of effective viscosity in a 0+1D system clarifies\nhow infinite families of $\\zeta/s(T)$ and $\\eta/s(T)$ can result in nearly\nidentical hydrodynamic temperature profiles. By extending the study to a\nboost-invariant cylindrical (1+1D) fluid, we identify an approximate but more\ngeneral definition of effective viscosity that highlight the potential and\nlimits of the concept of effective viscosity in fluids with limited symmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 01:47:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 19:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

This agent can recruit high-fitness actors from\nthe population of evolutionary algorithms, which instructs itself to learn from\nexperience replay buffer. At the same time, low-fitness actors in the\nevolutionary population can imitate behavior patterns of the reinforcement\nlearning agent and improve their adaptability. Reinforcement and imitation\nlearners in this framework can be replaced with any off-policy actor-critic\nreinforcement learner or data-driven imitation learner. We evaluate RIM on a\nseries of benchmarks for continuous control tasks in Mujoco. The experimental\nresults show that RIM outperforms prior evolutionary or reinforcement learning\nmethods. The performance of RIM's components is significantly better than\ncomponents of previous evolutionary reinforcement learning algorithm, and the\nrecruitment using soft update enables reinforcement learning agent to learn\nfaster than that using hard update.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 03:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-16"}

Higher-dimensional physical systems exhibit topological\nproperties not shared by their lower dimensional counterparts and, in general,\noffer richer physics. One example is a d-dimensional quantized multipole\ntopological insulator, which supports multipoles of order up to 2^d and a\nhierarchy of gapped boundary modes with topological 0-D corner modes at the\ntop. While multipole topological insulators have been successfully realized in\nelectromagnetic and mechanical 2D systems with quadrupole polarization, and a\n3D octupole topological insulator was recently demonstrated in acoustics, going\nbeyond the three physical dimensions of space is an intriguing and challenging\ntask.

Indeed, this assumption can neither be properly implemented within\nthe standard framework of quantum mechanics.

These propagating\nAndreev modes are essentially charge neutral and therefore they transfer energy\nbut not electric charge. One main result of this work is that when the Dirac\ntheory of graphene is deformed into a tilted Dirac cone, the breaking of charge\nconjugation symmetry of the Dirac equation renders the resulting Andreev modes\nelectrically charged. We calculate an otherwise zero charge conductance arising\nsolely from the tilt parameters $\\vec\\zeta=(\\zeta_x,\\zeta_y)$. The\ndistinguishing feature of such a form of charge transport from the charge\ntransport caused by normal electrons is their dependence on the phase\ndifference $\\phi$ of the two superconductors which can be experimentally\nextracted by employing a flux bias. Another result concerns the enhancement of\nJosephson current in a regime where instead of propagating Andreev modes,\nlocalized Andreev levels are formed. In this regime, we find enhancement by\norders of magnitude of the Josephson current when the tilt parameter is brought\ncloser and closer to $\\zeta=1$ limit. We elucidate that, the enhancement is due\nto a combination of two effects: (i) enhancement of number of transmission\nchannels by flattening of the band upon tilting to $\\zeta\\approx 1$, and (ii) a\nnon-trivial dependence on the angle $\\theta$ of the the tilt vector\n$\\vec\\zeta$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 08:12:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

We address scenarios where\nmalicious node(s) attempt to disrupt, in an uncoordinated or coordinated\nmanner, the localization process of a target node. We propose four techniques\nfor secure localization: weighted least square (WLS), secure weighted least\nsquare (SWLS), and $\\ell_1$-norm based techniques LN-1 and LN-1E, in a network\nthat includes one or more compromised anchor nodes. WLS and SWLS techniques are\nshown to offer significant advantage over existing techniques by assigning\nlarger weights to the anchor nodes that are closer to the target node, and by\ndetecting the malicious nodes and eliminating their measurements from the\nlocalization process. In a coordinated attack, the localization problem can be\nposed as a plane fitting problem where the measurements from non-malicious and\nmalicious anchor nodes lie on two different planes. LN-1E technique estimates\nthese two planes and prevents disruption of the localization process. The\nCramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the position estimate is also derived. The\nproposed techniques are shown to provide better localization accuracy than the\nexisting algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 08:48:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-16"}

To generalize\nclassical phase-field models, we derive the phase-field gradient theory based\non balances of microforces, microtorques, and mass. We focus on materials where\nsecond gradients of the phase field describe long-range interactions. By\nconsidering a nontrivial interaction inside the body, described by a\nboundary-edge microtraction, we characterize the existence of a\nmicrohypertraction field, a central aspect of this theory. On surfaces, we\ndefine the surface microtraction and the surface-couple microtraction emerging\nfrom internal surface interactions.

We numerically study how finite deformation rates\ninfluence ductile and brittle yielding behaviors using model glasses in two and\nthree spatial dimensions. We find that a finite shear rate systematically\nenhances the stress overshoot of poorly-annealed systems, without necessarily\nproducing shear bands. For well-annealed systems, the non-equilibrium\ndiscontinuous yielding transition is smeared out by finite shear rates and it\nis accompanied by the emergence of multiple shear bands that have been also\nreported in metallic glass experiments. We show that the typical size of the\nbands and the distance between them increases algebraically with the inverse\nshear rate. We provide a dynamic scaling argument for the corresponding\nlengthscale, based on the competition between the deformation rate and the\npropagation time of the shear bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 11:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}

The\nseller (i.e., the government) can choose a number of licenses to put up for\nauction, and wishes to maximize the societal welfare: the total economic value\nof the buyers minus the social cost. Motivated by emission license markets\ndeployed in practice, we focus on uniform price auctions with a price floor\nand/or price ceiling. The seller has distributional information about the\nmarket, and their goal is to tune the auction parameters to maximize expected\nwelfare. The target benchmark is the maximum expected welfare achievable by any\nsuch auction under truth-telling behavior. Unfortunately, the uniform price\nauction is not truthful, and strategic behavior can significantly reduce (even\nbelow zero) the welfare of a given auction configuration.\n  We describe a subclass of \"safe-price'\" auctions for which the welfare at any\nBayes-Nash equilibrium will approximate the welfare under truth-telling\nbehavior. We then show that the better of a safe-price auction, or a truthful\nauction that allocates licenses to only a single buyer, will approximate the\ntarget benchmark. In particular, we show how to choose a number of licenses and\na price floor so that the worst-case welfare, at any equilibrium, is a constant\napproximation to the best achievable welfare under truth-telling after\nexcluding the welfare contribution of a single buyer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 11:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-16"}

Based on this\nconcept, this paper considers a hybrid content distribution model in\npeer-to-peer content deliver networks. A user or peer in this network can get\nits content either directly from the content provider (CP), or from a\nneighboring user who has this content stored and is willing to share it. Two\ntypes of users are considered: premium users are the users getting always the\ncontent directly from the CP, and standard user are the users getting the\ncontent from other standard users, when possible, otherwise from the CP.\nFurthermore, standard user share their content to other users if required. This\npaper studies the pricing problem of the CP such that there are enough standard\nusers to distribute the content (using less network resources and reducing\nsignificantly the delay) while maximizing the CP benefits.We address the\nproblem from a game theoretic approach and evaluate when the Nash Equilibrium\ncan be attained. The obtained case have been applied to a real life study using\na BBC iPlayer dataset and an analysis on the CP benefits dependence on\ndifferent parameters. Finally we extend this pricing model when considering\nalso the reduction of load on its content custodian (server) and discuss how\nthe pricing policy is affected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 12:09:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-16"}

The phase\ndifferences obtained using the spectral lines are significantly different from\nthe phase differences in the simulation. The phase coherency between two\natmospheric layers in the gravity wave regime is height dependent and is seen\nto decrease with the travel distance between the observed layers. We conclude\nthat the energy flux of IGWs determined from the phase difference analysis may\nbe overestimated by an order of magnitude.

High order, consistent, and local\n(using compact computational stencils) mesh-free methods are particularly\ndesirable. Here we present a novel framework for generating local high order\ndifference operators for arbitrary node distributions, referred to as the Local\nAnisotropic Basis Function Method (LABFM). Weights are constructed from linear\nsums of anisotropic basis functions (ABFs), chosen to ensure exact reproduction\nof polynomial fields up to a given order. The ABFs are based on a fundamental\nRadial Basis Function (RBF), and the choice of fundamental RBF has small effect\non accuracy, but influences stability. LABFM is able to generate high order\ndifference operators with compact computational stencils (4th order with 25\nnodes, 8th order with 60 nodes in two dimensions). At domain boundaries (with\nincomplete support) LABFM automatically provides one-sided differences of the\nsame order as the internal scheme, up to 4th order. We use the method to solve\nelliptic, parabolic and mixed hyperbolic-parabolic PDEs, showing up to 8th\norder convergence. The inclusion of hyperviscosity is straightforward, and can\neffectively provide stability when solving hyperbolic problems. LABFM is a\npromising new mesh-free method for the numerical solution of PDEs in complex\ngeometries. The method is highly scalable, and for Eulerian schemes, the\ncomputational efficiency is competitive with RBF-FD for a given accuracy. A\nparticularly attractive feature is that in the low order limit, LABFM collapses\nto SPH, and there is potential for Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian schemes with\nnatural adaptivity of resolution and accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 12:36:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 14:43:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 15:05:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

As such, the deep\nhierarchical information cannot be learned, which may result in inaccurate\nrecoveries for complex real data. In this paper, we explore the deep\nmulti-subspace recovery problem by designing a multilayer architecture for\nlatent LRR. Technically, we propose a new Multilayer Collabora-tive Low-Rank\nRepresentation Network model termed DeepLRR to discover deep features and deep\nsubspaces. In each layer (>2), DeepLRR bilinearly reconstructs the data matrix\nby the collabo-rative representation with low-rank coefficients and projection\nmatrices in the previous layer. The bilinear low-rank reconstruc-tion of\nprevious layer is directly fed into the next layer as the input and low-rank\ndictionary for representation learning, and is further decomposed into a deep\nprincipal feature part, a deep salient feature part and a deep sparse error. As\nsuch, the coher-ence issue can be also resolved due to the low-rank dictionary,\nand the robustness against noise can also be enhanced in the feature subspace.\nTo recover the sparse errors in layers accurately, a dynamic growing strategy\nis used, as the noise level will be-come smaller for the increase of layers.\nBesides, a neighborhood reconstruction error is also included to encode the\nlocality of deep salient features by deep coefficients adaptively in each\nlayer.

To this end, we take a two-fold approach that involves a comparative\nanalysis of Halpha velocity fields in 123 local ETGs from the CALIFA integral\nfield spectroscopy survey with 20 simulated galaxies from high-resolution\nhydrodynamic cosmological SPHgal simulations. The latter were re-simulated for\ntwo modeling setups, one with and another without AGN feedback. In order to\nquantify the effects of AGN feedback on gas kinematics we measure three\nparameters that probe deviations from simple regular rotation using the\nkinemetry package. These indicators trace the possible presence of distinct\nkinematic components in Fourier space (k3,5/k1), variations in the radial\nprofile of the kinematic major axis (sigma_PA), and offsets between the stellar\nand gas velocity fields (Delta Phi). These quantities are monitored in the\nsimulations from a redshift 3 to 0.2 to assess the connection between black\nhole accretion history, stellar mass growth and kinematical perturbation of the\nWIM. Observed local massive galaxies show a broad range of irregularities,\nindicating disturbed warm gas motions, irrespective of being classified via\ndiagnostic lines as AGN or not. Simulations of massive galaxies with AGN\nfeedback generally exhibit higher irregularity parameters than without AGN\nfeedback, more consistent with observations. Besides AGN feedback, other\nprocesses like major merger events or infalling gas clouds can lead to elevated\nirregularity parameters, but they are typically of shorter duration. More\nspecifically, k3,5/k1 is most sensitive to AGN feedback, whereas Delta Phi is\nmost strongly affected by gas infall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 13:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

Since small orientation changes can have a strong impact on the EMCD\nmeasurement, it is experimentally non trivial to measure the EMCD signal as a\nfunction of sample orientation. The classical EMCD experimental setup requires\nto tilt the crystal in a 2 beam orientation and to acquire two electron energy\nloss spectra at two conjugate scattering angles. The effect of a mistilt from\nthe perfect 2-beam orientation on the measured EMCD signals has not been\nexplored yet due to different experimental constraints. In order to maintain\nthe exact sample location and orientation for the acquisition of the EMCD\nsignal, we have developed a methodology to simultaneously map the quantitative\nEMCD signals and the local orientation of the crystal. We analyse, both\nexperimentally and with simulations, how the measured magnetic signals evolve\nwith a change in the crystal tilt from the exact 2-beam orientation. Based on\nthis analysis, we establish an accurate relationship between the crystal\norientations and the EMCD signals. Our results demonstrate that a small crystal\ntilt away from the 2-beam orientation can significantly alter the strength and\nthe distribution of the EMCD signals. From an optimisation of the crystal\norientation, we obtain quantitative EMCD measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 13:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-16"}

While an\nEuler-Poincar\\'e formulation of Vlasov-Maxwell-type systems, effectively\nstarting with Low's action and using constrained variations for the Eulerian\ndescription of particle motion, has been known for a while [J.

Recent researches show that\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are very effective to detect steganography\nby learning discriminative features between cover images and their stegos.\nSeveral deep CNN models have been proposed via incorporating domain knowledge\nof image steganography/steganalysis into the design of the network and achieve\nstate of the art performance on standard database.

In DIII-D ITER Similar Shape (ISS) plasmas with n=3 RMPs,\nthe range of q95 for ELM suppression is found to increase with decreasing\nelectron density.

While tools that separate mixed signals into linear\nsources have proven necessary and useful, the underlying equational forms of\nmost natural signals are unknown and nonlinear. Hence, there is a need for a\nframework that is general enough to extract sources without knowledge of their\ngenerating equations, and flexible enough to accommodate nonlinear, even\nchaotic, sources. Here we provide such a framework, where the sources are\nchaotic trajectories from independently evolving dynamical systems. We consider\nthe mixture signal as the sum of two chaotic trajectories, and propose a\nsupervised learning scheme that extracts the chaotic trajectories from their\nmixture. Specifically, we recruit a complex dynamical system as an intermediate\nprocessor that is constantly driven by the mixture. We then obtain the\nseparated chaotic trajectories based on this intermediate system by training\nthe proper output functions. To demonstrate the generalizability of this\nframework \\emph{in silico}, we employ a tank of water as the intermediate\nsystem, and show its success in separating two-part mixtures of various chaotic\ntrajectories. Finally, we relate the underlying mechanism of this method to the\nstate-observer problem.

It is very\nchallenging due to the complicated spatial dependencies between different\nlocations and dynamic temporal dependencies among different time intervals.\nAlthough measurements of both dependencies are employed, existing methods\nsuffer from the following two problems. First, the temporal dependencies are\nmeasured either uniformly or bias against long-term dependencies, which\noverlooks the distinctive impacts of short-term and long-term temporal\ndependencies. Second, the existing methods capture spatial and temporal\ndependencies independently, which wrongly assumes that the correlations between\nthese dependencies are weak and ignores the complicated mutual influences\nbetween them.

At a further\nincrease in the coupling, the spiraling disappears, and the system behavior\npasses to a sort of spatiotemporal chaos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 12:11:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2020 14:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

However,\nthere are major challenges in scaling up the throughput of such networks.\nLightning network and Spider network are alternates that build bidirectional\npayment channels on top of cryptocurrency networks using smart contracts, to\nenable fast transactions that bypass the Blockchain. In this paper, we study\nthe problem of routing transactions in such a payment processing network. We\nfirst propose a Stochastic model to study such a system, as opposed to a fluid\nmodel that is studied in the literature. Each link in such a model is a\ntwo-sided queue, and unlike classical queues, such queues are not stable unless\nthere is an external control. We propose a notion of stability for the payment\nprocessing network consisting of such two-sided queues using the notion of\non-chain rebalancing. We then characterize the capacity region and propose a\nthroughput optimal algorithm that stabilizes the system under any load within\nthe capacity region. The stochastic model enables us to study closed loop\npolicies, which typically have better queuing/delay performance than the open\nloop policies (or static split rules) studied in the literature. We investigate\nthis through simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 19:46:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 21:08:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 18:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-25"}

A promising candidate is the redox-based\nresistive switch repositing the information in form of different resistance\nstates. For reliable programming, the underlying physical parameters need to be\nunderstood. We reveal that the programmable resistance states are linked to\ninternal series resistances and the fundamental nonlinear switching kinetics.\nThe switching kinetics of Ta$_{2}$O$_{5}$-based cells was investigated in a\nwide range over 15 orders of magnitude from 250 ps to 10$^{5}$ s. We found\nstrong evidence for a switching speed of 10 ps which is consistent with analog\nelectronic circuit simulations. On all time scales, multi-bit data storage\ncapabilities were demonstrated.
