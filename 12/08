Despite many advances, existing cluster schedulers force the same\nperformance goal - fairness in most cases - on all jobs. Latency-sensitive jobs\nsuffer, while throughput-sensitive ones thrive. Using prioritization does the\nopposite: it opens up a path for latency-sensitive jobs to dominate. In this\npaper, we tackle the challenges in supporting both short-term performance and\nlong-term fairness simultaneously with high resource utilization by proposing\nBounded Priority Fairness (BoPF). BoPF provides short-term resource guarantees\nto latency-sensitive jobs and maintains long-term fairness for\nthroughput-sensitive jobs. BoPF is the first scheduler that can provide\nlong-term fairness, burst guarantee, and Pareto efficiency in a strategyproof\nmanner for multi-resource scheduling. Deployments and large-scale simulations\nshow that BoPF closely approximates the performance of Strict Priority as well\nas the fairness characteristics of DRF. In deployments, BoPF speeds up\nlatency-sensitive jobs by 5.38 times compared to DRF, while still maintaining\nlong-term fairness. In the meantime, BoPF improves the average completion times\nof throughput-sensitive jobs by up to 3.05 times compared to Strict Priority.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2019 16:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

We use molecular dynamics simulations to\ncharacterize the coarsening kinetics, in bad solvent, for several\nmacromolecular systems with an increasing degree of structural complexity. In\nparticular, we focus on: flexible and semiflexible polymer chains, star\npolymers with 3 and 12 arms, and microgels with both ordered and disordered\nnetworks. Starting from a powerful analogy with critical phenomena, we\nconstruct a density field representation that removes fast fluctuations and\nprovides a consistent characterization of the domain growth. Our results\nindicate that the coarsening kinetics presents a scaling behaviour that is\nindependent of the solvent quality parameter, in analogy to time-temperature\nsuperposition principle. Interestingly, the domain growth in time follows a\npower-law behaviour that is approximately independent of the architecture for\nall the flexible systems; while it is steeper for the semiflexible chains.\nNevertheless, the fractal nature of the dense regions emerging during the\ncollapse exhibits the same scaling behaviour for all the macromolecules. This,\nsuggests that the faster growing length scale in the semiflexible chains\noriginates just from a faster mass diffusion along the chain contour, induced\nby the local stiffness. The decay of the dynamic correlations displays scaling\nbehavior with the growing length scale of the system, which is a characteristic\nsignature in coarsening phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2019 19:44:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

However, in real-life situations (which are often modeled by SGs)\nthe followers (terrorists, thieves, poachers or smugglers) -- as humans in\ngeneral -- may act not in a perfectly rational way, as their decisions may be\naffected by biases of various kinds which bound rationality of their decisions.\nOne of the popular models of bounded rationality (BR) is Anchoring Theory (AT)\nwhich claims that humans have a tendency to flatten probabilities of available\noptions, i.e. they perceive a distribution of these probabilities as being\ncloser to the uniform distribution than it really is. This paper proposes an\nefficient formulation of AT in sequential extensive-form SGs (named ATSG),\nsuitable for Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) solution methods. ATSG is\nimplemented in three MILP/LP-based state-of-the-art methods for solving\nsequential SGs and two recently introduced non-MILP approaches: one relying on\nMonte Carlo sampling (O2UCT) and the other one (EASG) employing Evolutionary\nAlgorithms.

Except for competitive time scalability, an\nadditional asset of non-MILP methods is flexibility of potential BR\nformulations they are able to incorporate.

It can be inferred that the thermodynamic quantities of all\nsuper-entropic black holes obey similar limiting relations to those of their\ncorresponding conventional rotating AdS black holes, and thus can be obtained\nby taking the ultra-spinning limit appropriately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2019 23:28:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 01:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

We have used different shallow\nand deep models for prediction and analyzed the relationships between number of\nhidden layers, accuracy, and computational time. The results suggest that while\ndeep networks perform better than shallow networks in modeling complex\nnon-linear functions, increasing the depth may not always produce desired\nresults.

Evaluation of the thermally induced phenomena\nrequires knowledge of the temperature differences across the oxide tunnel\nbarrier adjacent to the ferromagnetic (FM) leads. However, it is challenging to\naccurately measure thermal properties of an oxide tunnel barrier consisting of\nonly a few atomic layers. In this work, we experimentally interrogate the\ntemperature evolutions in Ru/oxide/FM/seed/MgO (oxide=MgO, MgAl2O4; FM=Co,\nCoFeB; seed=Pt, Ta) structures having perpendicular magnetic anisotropy using\nultrafast thermometry.

Owing to the importance of\nindustrial control systems, and the possibly devastating consequences of being\nattacked, significant endeavors have been attempted to secure industrial\ncontrol systems from cyberattacks.

One key important fusion performance\nparameter is the pedestal density. Understanding the pedestal density formation\nis critical for the development of predictive model of future fusion devices.\nTypically, measurements of the neutrals are obtained using optical emission\nspectroscopy of the Lyman alpha lines, which is a line-integrated measurement.\nThe plasma in tokamaks is characterized by a high density of electrons and ions\nand a relatively low concentration of neutral hydrogen atoms, which could make\ndirect measurement of density seemingly impossible at first.\n  We propose a laser-based method that allows for accurate measurement of both\nthe spatial and absolute magnitude of the neutral D/H with minimal knowledge of\nthe radial profiles of electron temperatures and densities.

We consider\nshot-based video summarization where the summary consists of a subset of the\nvideo shots which can be of various lengths. A straightforward approach to\nmaximize the representativeness of a subset of shots is by minimizing the total\ndistance between shots and their nearest selected shots. We formulate the task\nof video summarization as an optimization problem with a knapsack-like\nconstraint on the total summary duration. Previous studies have proposed greedy\nalgorithms to solve this problem approximately, but no experiments were\npresented to measure the ability of these methods to obtain solutions with low\ntotal distance. Indeed, our experiments on video summarization datasets show\nthat the success of current methods in obtaining results with low total\ndistance still has much room for improvement.

Many previous works get\nimpressive results in the strictly controlled condition with accurate prior\nstatistics and dedicated dynamic model for certain object. But in challenging\nconditions without dedicated dynamic model and precise prior statistics, the\nperformance of these methods significantly declines. To solve the problem, a\ndynamic model called the power-limited steering model (PLS) is proposed to\ndescribe the motion of non-cooperative object. It is a natural combination of\ninstantaneous power and instantaneous angular velocity, which relies on the\nnonlinearity instead of the state switching probability to achieve switching of\nstates. And the renormalization group is introduced to compensate the nonlinear\neffect of perturbation in PLS model.

To remedy the above problems,\nthis paper proposes a Domain-Adaptive Crowd Counting (DACC) framework, which\nconsists of a high-quality image translation and density map reconstruction. To\nbe specific, the former focuses on translating synthetic data to realistic\nimages, which prompts the translation quality by segregating\ndomain-shared/independent features and designing content-aware consistency\nloss. The latter aims at generating pseudo labels on real scenes to improve the\nprediction quality.

It is notable that existing DA methods are\ngenerally designed only for a specific scenario, and may underperform for\nscenarios they are not tailored to. To this end, this paper studies Versatile\nDomain Adaptation (VDA), where one method can handle several different DA\nscenarios without any modification. Towards this goal, a more general inductive\nbias other than the domain alignment should be explored. We delve into a\nmissing piece of existing methods: class confusion, the tendency that a\nclassifier confuses the predictions between the correct and ambiguous classes\nfor target examples, which is common in different DA scenarios. We uncover that\nreducing such pairwise class confusion leads to significant transfer gains.\nWith this insight, we propose a general loss function: Minimum Class Confusion\n(MCC). It can be characterized as (1) a non-adversarial DA method without\nexplicitly deploying domain alignment, enjoying faster convergence speed; (2) a\nversatile approach that can handle four existing scenarios: Closed-Set,\nPartial-Set, Multi-Source, and Multi-Target DA, outperforming the\nstate-of-the-art methods in these scenarios, especially on one of the largest\nand hardest datasets to date (7.3% on DomainNet). Its versatility is further\njustified by two scenarios proposed in this paper: Multi-Source Partial DA and\nMulti-Target Partial DA. In addition, it can also be used as a general\nregularizer that is orthogonal and complementary to a variety of existing DA\nmethods, accelerating convergence and pushing these readily competitive methods\nto stronger ones.

We\naim to handle moderate sized interference graphs which have 100 nodes or less.\nFor such graphs we can get the optimal allocation of colors to the nodes. Such\noptimal coloring is then used to train our Deep Learning network which is based\non several layers of LSTM that output a color for each node of the graph.\nHowever, the current network may allocate the same color to the nodes connected\nby an edge resulting in an invalid coloring of the interference graph.

The\nsolution to this optimization problem is that the cell-integrated error\nindicator should be equi-distributed; a corollary is that one cannot link the\naccuracy in LES to quantities that are not cell-integrated, including the\ncommon belief that LES is accurate whenever 80-90\\% of the energy is resolved.\nThe full method is tested on the wall-resolved LES of turbulent channel flow\nand the flow over a backward-facing step, with final length scale fields (or\nfilter-width fields, or grids) that are close to what is considered \"best\npractice\" in the LES literature. Finally, the derivation of the error indicator\noffers an alternative explanation for the success of the dynamic procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2019 23:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

As a representative legacy bus system, the Controller\nArea Network (CAN) hosts Electronic Control Units (ECUs) that are crucial\nvehicle functioning. In this scenario, malicious actors can exploit CAN\nvulnerabilities, such as the lack of built-in authentication and encryption\nschemes, to launch CAN bus attacks with life-threatening consequences (e.g.,\ndisabling brakes). In this paper, we present TACAN (Transmitter Authentication\nin CAN), which provides secure authentication of ECUs on the legacy CAN bus by\nexploiting the covert channels, without introducing CAN protocol modifications\nor traffic overheads. TACAN turns upside-down the originally malicious concept\nof covert channels and exploits it to build an effective defensive technique\nthat facilitates transmitter authentication via a centralized, trusted Monitor\nNode. TACAN consists of three different covert channels for ECU authentication:\n1) the Inter-Arrival Time (IAT)-based; 2) the Least Significant Bit\n(LSB)-based; and 3) a hybrid covert channel, exploiting the combination of the\nfirst two. In order to validate TACAN, we implement the covert channels on the\nUniversity of Washington (UW) EcoCAR (Chevrolet Camaro 2016) testbed. We\nfurther evaluate the bit error, throughput, and detection performance of TACAN\nthrough extensive experiments using the EcoCAR testbed and a publicly available\ndataset collected from Toyota Camry 2010.
