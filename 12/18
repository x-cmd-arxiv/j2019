As a result, biopolymer nucleation often\ninvolves a two-step mechanism where the monomers first condense to form a\nmetastable intermediate, and this then converts to a stable polymer by\nconformational rearrangement of its constituent monomers. While existing\nmathematical models neglect the dynamics by which intermediates convert to\nstable polymers, experiments and simulations show that these dynamics\nfrequently occur on comparable timescales to condensation of intermediates and\ngrowth of mature polymers, and thus cannot be ignored. Moreover, nucleation\nintermediates are responsible for cell toxicity in pathologies such as\nAlzheimer's, Parkinson's, and prion diseases. Due to the relationship between\nconformation and biological function, the slow conversion dynamics of these\nspecies will strongly affect their toxicity. In this study, we present a\nmodified Oosawa model which explicitly accounts for simultaneous assembly and\nconversion. To describe the conversion dynamics, we propose an experimentally\nmotivated initiation-propagation (IP) mechanism in which the stable phase\narises locally within the intermediate, and then spreads through additional\nconversion events induced by nearest-neighbor interactions, analogous to\none-dimensional Glauber dynamics. Our mathematical analysis shows that the\ncompeting timescales of assembly and conversion result in a nonequilibrium\ncritical point, separating a regime where intermediates are kinetically\nunstable from one where conformationally mixed intermediates can accumulate.\nOur work provides the first general model of two-step biopolymer nucleation,\nwhich can be used to quantitatively predict the concentration and composition\nof biologically crucial intermediates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 16:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

As the name suggested, the\nDG framework allows a discontinuity at the element interfaces, which seems for\nmany researchers a favorable property in case of hyperbolic balance laws. On\nthe contrary, continuous Galerkin method obtained from a straightforward\ndiscretisation of the weak form of the PDEs appear to be unsuitable for\nhyperbolic problems. To remedy this issue, stabilization terms are usually\nadded and various formulations can be found in the literature. There exists\nstill the perception that continuous Galerkin methods are not suited to\nhyperbolic problems, and the reason of this is the continuity of the\napproximation. However, this perception is not true and the stabilization terms\ncan be removed, in general, provided the boundary conditions are suitable. In\nthis paper, we deal with this problem, and present a different approach. We use\nthe boundary conditions to stabilize the scheme following a procedure that are\nfrequently used in the finite difference community. Here, the main idea is to\nimpose the boundary conditions weakly and specific boundary operators are\nconstructed such that they guarantee stability. This approach has already been\nused in the DG framework, but here we apply it with a continuous Galerkin\nscheme. No internal dissipation is needed even if unstructured grids are used.\nFurther, we point out that we do not need exact integration, it suffices if the\nquadrature rule and the norm in the differential operator are the same, such\nthat the summation-by-parts (SBP) property is fulfilled meaning that a discrete\nGauss Th. is valid. This contradicts the perception in the hyperbolic community\nthat stability issues for pure Galerkin scheme exist.

Such label noise puts a fundamental limit to the\nperformance attainable by regression models. We address this challenge by\nderiving a theoretical upper bound for the coefficient of determination (R2)\nfor regression models. This theoretical upper bound depends only on the noise\nassociated with the response variable in a dataset as well as its variance. The\nupper bound estimate was validated via Monte Carlo simulations and then used as\na tool to bootstrap performance of regression models trained on biological\ndatasets, including protein sequence data, transcriptomic data, and genomic\ndata.

Looking at these challenges through the lens of causality allows\ndecisions about data collection, annotation procedures, and learning strategies\nto be made (and scrutinized) more transparently. We discuss how causal\nrelationships between images and annotations can not only have profound effects\non the performance of predictive models, but may even dictate which learning\nstrategies should be considered in the first place. For example, we conclude\nthat semi-supervision may be unsuitable for image segmentation---one of the\npossibly surprising insights from our causal analysis, which is illustrated\nwith representative real-world examples of computer-aided diagnosis (skin\nlesion classification in dermatology) and radiotherapy (automated contouring of\ntumours).

Standard\ndepth-of-anesthesia tracking does not readily capture inter-individual\ndifferences in response to anesthetics, especially those due to age, and does\nnot aim to predict a relationship between a control input (infused anesthetic\ndose) and system state (commonly, a function of electroencephalography (EEG)\nsignal). In this work, we developed a control-ready patient model for\nclosed-loop propofol-induced anesthesia using data recorded during a clinical\nstudy of EEG during general anesthesia in ten healthy volunteers. We used\nprincipal component analysis to identify the low-dimensional state-space in\nwhich EEG signal evolves during anesthesia delivery. We parameterized the\nresponse of the EEG signal to changes in propofol target-site concentration\nusing logistic models. We note that inter-individual differences in anesthetic\nsensitivity may be captured by varying a constant cofactor of the predicted\neffect-site concentration. We linked the EEG dose-response with the control\ninput using a pharmacokinetic model. Finally, we present a simple nonlinear\nmodel predictive control in silico demonstration of how such a closed-loop\nsystem would work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 17:24:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

In the inner corona, their estimated\nspeed was very low of about 200-360 km/s. The respective interplanetary\ntransients apparently propagated between two high-speed solar wind streams\noriginated from a two-component coronal hole and therefore their expansion was\nlimited. The resulting ejecta arrived at the Earth only on 25 August and\nbrought an unexpectedly strong field of Bt ~ 18.2 nT with a predominantly\nnegative Bz component of almost the same strength. The geospace storm also\nmanifested itself in the form of a peculiar Forbush decrease (FD). Its\nmagnitude was about 1.5%, which is rather small for the observed G3-class GMS.\nThe main unusual feature of the event is that large positive bursts with an\nenhancement up to 3% above the pre-event level were recorded on the FD\nbackground. We argue that these bursts were mainly caused by an unusually large\nand changeable cosmic ray anisotropy combined with lowering of the geomagnetic\ncutoff rigidity in the perturbed Earth's magnetosphere under conditions of the\ncycle minimum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 17:37:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

The introductory part\nprovides an outline of the theoretical framework of QCD collinear factorization\nand the used statistical methods and relates the work presented here to other\nsimilar contemporary analyses. As a result, a new set of nPDFs, EPPS16, is\npresented, including for the first time electroweak-boson and dijet production\ndata from CERN-LHC proton-lead collisions and allowing a full flavour\nseparation in the fit. The flavour separation is constrained with Drell-Yan\ndilepton-production data from fixed target pion-nucleus experiments and\nneutrino-nucleus deep-inelastic scattering data, which are shown to give\nevidence for the similarity of the u and d valence-quark nuclear modifications.\nFor studying the gluon degrees of freedom, collider data are essential and in\nthe EPPS16 analysis new constraints are derived from the dijet production at\nthe LHC. Possible further constraints for the gluons are investigated in terms\nof the LHC data on nuclear modification ratios of dijet and D-meson production.\nUsing a non-quadratically improved Hessian reweighting method, these\nmeasurements are found to put stringent constraints on the gluon modifications\nin the lead nucleus, reaching smaller values of the nucleon momentum fraction\nthan previously accessible.

One common measure of precision is the unconditional\nmean square error. Unconditional mean square error has been a primary motivator\nfor optimal designs; commonly, defined as the design that maximizes a concave\nfunction of the expected Fisher information. The inverse of expected Fisher\ninformation is asymptotically equal to the mean square error of the maximum\nlikelihood estimate. There is a substantial amount of existing literature that\nargues the mean square error conditioned on an appropriate ancillary statistic\nbetter represents the precision of the maximum likelihood estimate. Despite\nevidence in favor of conditioning, limited effort has been made to find designs\nthat are optimal with respect to conditional mean square error. The inverse of\nobserved Fisher information is a higher order approximation of the conditional\nmean square error than the inverse of expected Fisher information [Efron and\nHinkley (1978)]. In light of this, a more relevant objective is to find designs\nthat optimize observed Fisher information. Unlike expected Fisher information,\nobserved Fisher information depends on the observed data and cannot be used to\ndesign an experiment completely in advance of data collection. In a sequential\nexperiment the observed Fisher information from past observations is available\nto inform the design of the next observation. In this work an adaptive design\nthat incorporates observed Fisher information is proposed for linear regression\nmodels.

In application to function approximation problems, the\napproximation accuracy using different basis functions and under different\nregularity assumptions is established by using the subsampled Poincar\\'e\ninequality. We observe that the error bound blows up as the subsampled\nlengthscale approaches zero, due to the fact that the underlying function is\nnot regular enough to have well-defined pointwise values.

There exists a previously overlooked contribution to\nthe shear viscosity from the interacting part of the stress tensor which\naccounts for the momentum flow induced by interactions. This contribution,\nwhich we dub drag viscosity, is caused by the frictional drag force due to\nlong-range interactions. It is therefore linked to Coulomb drag which also\noriginates from the interaction induced drag force.

Beyond its theoretical value, this work may also have significant\nimpact in the field of time-varying metamaterials, especially in the study of\nradiation from subwavelength meta-atoms, scatterers and emitters that are\ntemporally modulated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 19:58:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Embedding learning\naims at learning discriminative representations of data such that similar\nexamples are pulled closer, while pushing away dissimilar ones. Despite their\nexemplary performances, supervised embedding learning approaches require huge\nnumber of annotations for training. This restricts their applicability for\nlarge datasets in new applications where obtaining labels require extensive\nmanual efforts and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose to learn an\nembedding in a completely unsupervised manner without using any class labels.\nUsing a graph-based clustering approach to obtain pseudo-labels, we form\ntriplet-based constraints following a metric learning paradigm. Our novel\nembedding learning approach uses a probabilistic notion, that intuitively\nminimizes the chances of each triplet violating a geometric constraint. Due to\nnature of the search space, we learn the parameters of our approach using\nRiemannian geometry. Our proposed approach performs competitive to\nstate-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 21:14:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-19"}

The proposed training of a\nhigh-resolution VAE model begins with the training of a low-resolution core\nmodel, which can be successfully trained on imbalanced data set. In subsequent\ntraining steps, new convolutional, upsampling, deconvolutional, and\ndownsampling layers are iteratively attached to the model. In each iteration,\nthe additional layers are trained based on the intermediate pretrained model -\na result of previous training iterations. Thus, the resolution of the model is\nprogressively increased up to the required resolution level. In this paper, the\nprogressive VAE training is exploited for learning a latent representation with\nimbalanced, highly sparse data sets and, consequently, generating routes in a\nconstrained 2D space. Routing problems (e.g., vehicle routing problem,\ntravelling salesman problem, and arc routing) are of special significance in\nmany modern applications (e.g., route planning, network maintenance, developing\nhigh-performance nanoelectronic systems, and others) and typically associated\nwith sparse imbalanced data.

The proposed\napproach exhibits a significant training speedup as compared with\nstate-of-the-art existing VAE training methods, while generating expected image\noutputs from unseen input data. Furthermore, the final progressive VAE models\nexhibit much more precise output representation, than the Generative\nAdversarial Network (GAN) models trained with comparable training time. The\nproposed method is expected to be applicable to a wide range of applications,\nincluding but not limited image impainting, sentence interpolation, and\nsemi-supervised learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 21:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-19"}

While these objects are often the end product of the\ncore-collapse (CC) explosion of massive stars, they could also be the outcome\nof the merging of two massive white dwarfs. In the merger scenario the ejected\nmaterial interacts with a constant-density circumbinary medium and creates\nsupersonic shocks. We found that when a radio pulse passes through these shocks\nthe dispersion measure (DM) increases with time during the free expansion\nphase. The rotation measure (RM) displays a similar trend if the power-law\nindex, $n$, of the outer part of the ejecta is $>6$. For $n = 6$ the RM remains\nconstant during this phase. Later, when the ejecta move into the Sedov-Taylor\nphase while the DM still increases, however, with a different rate, the RM\nreduces.

Otherwise if $\\mathcal R_0>1,$ it is unstable\nand the system has a unique positive endemic equilibrium. In the special case\nof constant vector to host inoculum size, we show the positive equilibrium is\nlocally asymptotically stable and the disease is weakly uniformly persistent.\nFurthermore numerical results suggest that within-vector-viral kinetics and\ndynamic inoculum size may play a substantial role in epidemics. Finally, we\naddress how the model can be utilized to better predict the success of control\nstrategies such as vaccination and drug treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 23:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-19"}

One of the driven applications for geo-social\ngroup search is organizing an impromptu activity. This is because the social\ncohesiveness of a found geo-social group ensures a good communication\natmosphere and the spatial closeness of the geo-social group reduces the\npreparation time for the activity. Most existing works treat geo-social group\nsearch as a problem that finds a group satisfying a single social constraint\nwhile optimizing the spatial proximity. However, when an impromptu activity has\nadditional demands on attendees, e.g., the activity requires that the attendees\nhave certain set of skills, the existing works cannot find an effective\ngeo-social group efficiently. In this paper, we study how to find a group that\nis most proximate to a query location while satisfying multiple constraints.\nSpecifically, the multiple constraints on which we focus include social\nconstraint, size constraint and keyword constraint. We propose a novel search\nframework which first effectively narrows down the search space with\ntheoretical guarantees and then efficiently finds the optimum result.

The model balances the fixed cost of making an\nadjustment, which is assumed independent of the magnitude of the adjustments,\nwith the cost of running the process off-target, which is assumed quadratic. It\nis also assumed that two controllable factors are available to compensate for\nthe deviations from target of two responses in the presence of a bivariate\nIMA(1,1) disturbance. The optimal policy has the form of a \"dead band\", in\nwhich adjustments are justified only when the predicted process responses\nexceed some boundary in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This boundary indicates when the\nresponses are predicted to be far enough from their targets that an additional\nadjustment or intervention in the process is justified.

A crucial aspect for the\ndetermination of the mass of the unseen black hole is the precise nature of its\nvisible companion, the B-type star LS V+22 25. Because stars of different mass\ncan exhibit B-type spectra during the course of their evolution, it is\nessential to obtain a comprehensive picture of the star to unravel its nature\nand, thus, its mass. To this end, we study the spectral energy distribution of\nLS V+22 25 and perform a quantitative spectroscopic analysis that includes the\ndetermination of chemical abundances for He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar,\nand Fe. Our analysis clearly shows that LS V+22 25 is not an ordinary main\nsequence B-type star. The derived abundance pattern exhibits heavy imprints of\nthe CNO bi-cycle of hydrogen burning, that is, He and N are strongly enriched\nat the expense of C and O. Moreover, the elements Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, and Fe are\nsystematically underabundant when compared to normal main-sequence B-type\nstars. We suggest that LS V+22 25 is a stripped helium star and discuss two\npossible formation scenarios. Combining our photometric and spectroscopic\nresults with the Gaia parallax, we infer a stellar mass of\n$1.1\\pm0.5\\,M_\\odot$. Based on the binary system's mass function, this yields a\nminimum mass of $2-3\\,M_\\odot$ for the compact companion, which implies that it\nmay not necessarily be a black hole but a massive neutron- or main sequence\nstar. The star LS V+22 25 has become famous for possibly having a very massive\nblack hole companion. However, a closer look reveals that the star itself is a\nvery intriguing object. Further investigations are necessary for complete\ncharacterization of this object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 01:58:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 14:10:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-13"}

Simulations have revealed that\nextensive tidal-stripping may pare a galaxy back to its tightly-bound, compact\nnuclear star cluster. It has therefore been proposed that the two-component\nnature of UCD galaxies may reflect the original nuclear star cluster surrounded\nby the paltry remnants of its host galaxy. A simple quantitative test of this\ntheory is devised and applied here. If the mass of the central black hole in\nUCD galaxies, relative to the mass of the UCD galaxies' inner stellar\ncomponent, i.e. the suspected nuclear star cluster, matches with the (black\nhole mass)-(nuclear star cluster mass) relation observed in other galaxies,\nthen it would provide quantitative support for the stripped galaxy scenario.\nSuch consistency is found for four of the five UCD galaxies reported to have a\nmassive black hole. The (black hole mass)-(nuclear star cluster mass) relation\nis then used to predict the central black hole mass in two additional UCD\ngalaxies, and to reveal that NGC 205 and possibly NGC 404 (which only has an\nupper limit to its black hole mass) also follow this scaling relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 02:34:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

The experiment\nshows that P-CapsNets achieve better performance than CapsNets with varied\nrouting procedures by using significantly fewer parameters on MNIST\\&CIFAR10.\nThe high efficiency of P-CapsNets is even comparable to some deep compressing\nmodels. For example, we achieve more than 99\\% percent accuracy on MNIST by\nusing only 3888 parameters. We visualize the capsules as well as the\ncorresponding correlation matrix to show a possible way of initializing\nCapsNets in the future. We also explore the adversarial robustness of\nP-CapsNets compared to CNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 03:45:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-19"}

Empirical\nstudies of the vegetation cover in some areas such as drylands and semiarid\nregions have revealed the existence of vegetation patches of broadly diverse\nsizes. In particular, the probability distribution of patch sizes can be fitted\nby a power law, i.e. vegetation patches are approximately scale free up to some\nmaximum size. Different explanatory mechanisms, such as plant-plant\ninteractions and plant-water feedback loops have been proposed to rationalize\nthe emergence of such scale-free patterns, yet a full understanding has not\nbeen reached. Using a simple model for vegetation dynamics, we show that\nenvironmental temporal variability -- a well-recognized feature of semiarid\nenvironments -- promotes in a robust way (i.e. for a wide range of parameter\nvalues) the emergence of vegetation patches with broadly distributed cluster\nsizes. Furthermore, this result is related to a percolation phenomenon that\noccurs in an intermittent or fluctuating way. The model also reveals that the\npower-law exponents fitting the tails of the probability distributions depend\non the overall vegetation-cover density, in agreement with empirical\nobservations. This supports the idea that environmental variability plays a key\nrole in the formation of scale-free vegetation patterns. From a practical\nviewpoint, this may be of importance to predict the effects that changes in\nenvironmental conditions may have in real ecosystems.

Such platforms\ncan exacerbate biases that drivers may have over certain types of requests. We\nconsider the case of peak hours when the demand for rides is more than the\nsupply of drivers. Drivers are well aware of their advantage during the peak\nhours and can choose to be selective about which rides to accept. Moreover, if\nin such a scenario, the assignment of requests to drivers (by the platform) is\nmade only to maximize profit and/or minimize wait time for riders, requests of\na certain type (e.g. from a non-popular pickup location, or to a non-popular\ndrop-off location) might never be assigned to a driver.

Recent\nadvances benefit from the meta-learning process where episodic tasks are formed\nto train a model that can adapt to class change. However, these task sare\nindependent to each other and existing works mainly rely on limited samples of\nindividual support set in a single meta task. This strategy leads to severe\nmeta shift issues across multiple tasks, meaning the learned prototypes or\nclass descriptors are not stable as each task only involves their own support\nset. To avoid this problem, we propose a concise Semantic RegularizationNetwork\nto learn a common semantic space under the framework of meta-learning. In this\nspace, all class descriptors can be regularized by the learned semantic basis,\nwhich can effectively solve the meta shift problem. The key is to train a class\nencoder and decoder structure that can encode the sample embedding features\ninto the semantic domain with trained semantic basis, and generate a more\nstable and general class descriptor from the decoder. We evaluate our work by\nextensive comparisons with previous methods on three benchmark datasets\n(MiniImageNet, TieredImageNet, and CUB).

Single-prong decay modes $\\tau^\\pm \\to\n\\pi^\\pm \\nu, \\tau^\\pm \\to \\pi^\\pm \\pi^0 \\nu, \\tau^\\pm \\to \\pi^\\pm \\pi^0 \\pi^0\n\\nu$ can be correctly identified in around 60-90% of cases, with sample\npurities in the range 50-90%, depending on decay mode. The sensitivity to tau\npolarisation was estimated in the four beam polarisation datasets envisaged for\nthe $4\\ ab^{-1}$ of data forseen for ILC-500. Statistical precisions on the\npolarisation in the different datasets are predicted to be between 0.5 and 2%.\nWhile some small performance differences between the two detector models are\nseen, they have very similar final sensitivity to the polarisation measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 06:09:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 08:14:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

We point out that a reduced density matrix in\nholographic CFTs possesses a sharp wedge structure such that inside the wedge\nwe can distinguish two local excitations, while outside we cannot. We can\ndetermine this wedge, which we call a CFT wedge, by computing a\ndistinguishability measure. We find that CFT wedges defined by the fidelity or\nBures distance as a distinguishability measure, coincide perfectly with shadows\nof entanglement wedges in AdS/CFT. We confirm this agreement between CFT wedges\nand entanglement wedges for two dimensional holographic CFTs where the\nsubsystem is chosen to be an interval or double intervals, as well as higher\ndimensional CFTs with a round ball subsystem. On the other hand if we consider\na free scalar CFT, we find that there are no sharp CFT wedges. This shows that\nsharp entanglement wedges emerge only for holographic CFTs owing to the large N\nfactorization.

This route-choice behavior is important in determining traffic\nmanagement, evacuation efficiency and building design. Here, we use field\nobservations and a virtual experiment to study the route choice behavior of\npedestrians around obstacles delimiting exit routes and examine the influence\nof three factors, namely the local distance to route starting points and the\npedestrian density and walking speeds along routes. Crucially, both field study\nand virtual experiment consider the same scenario which allows us to directly\nassess the validity of testing pedestrian behavior in virtual environments. We\nfind that in both data sets the proportion of people who choose a closer exit\nroute increases as the difference in distance between exit route starting\npoints increases. Pedestrians' choices in our data also depend on pedestrian\ndensity along routes, with people preferring less used routes. Our results thus\nconfirm previously established route choice mechanisms and we can predict over\n74% of choices based on these factors. The qualitative agreement in results\nbetween the field study and the virtual experiment suggests that in simple\nroute-choice scenarios, such as the one we investigate here, virtual\nexperiments can be a valid experimental technique for studying pedestrian\nbehavior.

To deal with such discrepancy, conditioned response\ngeneration has been introduced where the generation process is factorized into\naction decision and language generation via explicit action representations. To\nobtain action representations, recent studies learn latent actions in an\nunsupervised manner based on the utterance lexical similarity. Such an action\nlearning approach is prone to diversities of language surfaces, which may\nimpinge task completion and language quality. To address this issue, we propose\nmulti-stage adaptive latent action learning (MALA) that learns semantic latent\nactions by distinguishing the effects of utterances on dialogue progress. We\nmodel the utterance effect using the transition of dialogue states caused by\nthe utterance and develop a semantic similarity measurement that estimates\nwhether utterances have similar effects. For learning semantic actions on\ndomains without dialogue states, MsALA extends the semantic similarity\nmeasurement across domains progressively, i.e., from aligning shared actions to\nlearning domain-specific actions. Experiments using multi-domain datasets, SMD\nand MultiWOZ, show that our proposed model achieves consistent improvements\nover the baselines models in terms of both task completion and language\nquality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 08:14:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 13:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

We present an algorithmic pipeline that bases\npattern matching on constraint checking. The key intuition is that each vertex\nor edge participating in a match has to meet a set of constrains implicitly\nspecified by the search template. The pipeline we propose, generates these\nconstraints and iterates over them to eliminate all the vertices and edges that\ndo not participate in any match, and reduces the background graph to a subgraph\nwhich is the union of all matches. Additional analysis can be performed on this\nannotated, reduced graph, such as full match enumeration.

It typically involves finding the steady\nstate, linearizing around it to obtain the Jacobian, and then solving for its\neigenvalues and eigenvectors. When the flow is modelled with Reynolds-averaged\nNavier--Stokes equations with a large boundary-layer-resolving mesh, the\nresulting eigenvalue problem can be of very high dimensions, and is thus\ncomputationally very challenging. To reduce the computational cost, a\nsimplified approach is proposed to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, by\nexploiting the cyclic symmetric nature of annular fluid domain for typical\ncompressors. It is shown that via a rotational transformation, the Jacobian can\nbe reduced to a block circulant matrix, whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors then\ncan be computed using only one sector of the entire domain. This simplified\napproach significantly lowers the memory overhead and the CPU time of the\neigenvalue analysis without compromising on the accuracy. The proposed method\nis applied to the eigenvalue analysis of an annular compressor cascade with 22\nrepeated sectors and it is shown the spectrum of the whole annulus can be\nobtained by using the information of 1 sector only, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 09:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-19"}

Although there\nare several methods to construct mesoscopic and macroscopic dynamic equations,\nsuch as the Onsager's method, their validity is not fully clear. In this work,\nwe theoretically analyze the dissipation in a mesoscopic Langevin equation in\ndetail, from the view point of stochastic energetics.

The machine learning models are trained on {\\emph ab initio} calculations\nfor excited electronic states, using the methylenimmonium cation\n(CH$_2$NH$_2^+$) as a model system. For the prediction of excited-state\nproperties, multiple outputs are desirable, which is straightforward with\nneural networks but less explored with kernel ridge regression. We overcome\nthis challenge for kernel ridge regression in the case of energy predictions by\nencoding the electronic states explicitly in the inputs, in addition to the\nmolecular representation. We adopt this strategy also for our neural networks\nfor comparison. Such a state encoding enables not only kernel ridge regression\nwith multiple outputs but leads also to more accurate machine learning models\nfor state-specific properties. An important goal for excited-state machine\nlearning models is their use in dynamics simulations, which needs not only\nstate-specific information but also couplings, i.e., properties involving pairs\nof states. Accordingly, we investigate the performance of different models for\nsuch coupling elements. Furthermore, we explore how combining all properties in\na single neural network affects the accuracy.

To disentangle these possibilities, we conduct\nhydrodynamical simulations of either purely diffusing or streaming CR electrons\nand compare the resulting brightness distributions to the observed synchrotron\nprofiles of the radio harps. We find compelling evidence that CR streaming is\nthe dominant propagation mode for GeV CRs in one of the radio harps.\nObservations at higher angular resolution should detect more radio harps and\nmay help to disentangle projection effects of the possibly three-dimensional\nflux-tube structure of the other radio harps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 10:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

In this\nthesis, we investigate the role of submodularity in provable non-convex\noptimization and validation of algorithms. A profound understanding which\nclasses of functions can be tractably optimized remains a central challenge for\nnon-convex optimization. By advancing the notion of submodularity to continuous\ndomains (termed \"continuous submodularity\"), we characterize a class of\ngenerally non-convex and non-concave functions -- continuous submodular\nfunctions, and derive algorithms for approximately maximizing them with strong\napproximation guarantees. Meanwhile, continuous submodularity captures a wide\nspectrum of applications, ranging from revenue maximization with general\nmarketing strategies, MAP inference for DPPs to mean field inference for\nprobabilistic log-submodular models, which renders it as a valuable domain\nknowledge in optimizing this class of objectives. Validation of algorithms is\nan information-theoretic framework to investigate the robustness of algorithms\nto fluctuations in the input/observations and their generalization ability. We\ninvestigate various algorithms for one of the paradigmatic unconstrained\nsubmodular maximization problem: MaxCut. Due to submodularity of the MaxCut\nobjective, we are able to present efficient approaches to calculate the\nalgorithmic information content of MaxCut algorithms. The results provide\ninsights into the robustness of different algorithmic techniques for MaxCut.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 10:13:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-19"}

In recent years, compressive sensing\napproaches have shown impressive results in signal processing by reducing the\nsampling bandwidth.

The evolution of a Keplerian disk is modeled using the Pringle\nequation, which describes the time variations of the surface density under the\naction of turbulent viscosity. The distributions of the density and temperature\nin the polar directions are computed simultaneously in the approximation that\nthe disk is hydrostatically stable. The computations of the vertical structure\nof the disk take into account heating by stellar radiation, interstellar\nradiation, and viscous heating. The main factor governing evolution of the disk\nin this model is the dependence of the viscosity coefficient on the radius of\nthe disk. The computations of this coefficient take into account the background\nviscosity providing the continuous accretion of the gas and the convective\nviscosity, which depends on the parameters of the convection at a given radius.\nThe results of computations of the global evolution and morphology of the disk\nobtained in this approach are presented. It is shown that, in the adopted\nmodel, the accretion has burst-like character: after the inner part of the disk\n( R < 3 AU) is filled with matter, this material is relatively fast discharged\nonto the star, after which the process is repeated. Our results may be useful\nfor explaining the activity of young FU Ori and EX Lup objects.

This behaviour is\noften assumed to be generic, and is widely referred to when interpreting\nexperimental results.

A pure quantum state collapsing to a black hole will\nhence eventually re-emerge as a state with strictly positive entropy, which\nconstitutes the famous black hole information paradox. Expanding on a remark by\nHawking we posit that BH entropy is a thermodynamic entropy, which must be\ndistinguished from information-theoretic entropy. The paradox can then be\nexplained by information return in Hawking radiation. The novel perspective\nadvanced here is that if BH entropy counts the number of accessible physical\nstates in a quantum black hole, then the paradox can be seen as an instance of\nthe fundamental problem of statistical mechanics. We suggest a specific analogy\nto the increase of the entropy in a solvation process. We further show that the\nhuge phase volume (${\\cal N}$), which must be made available to the universe in\na gravitational collapse, cannot originate from the entanglement between\nordinary matter and/or radiation inside and outside the black hole.

The cancellation system will use optimally filtered data\nfrom a seismometer array to produce an estimate of the Newtonian-noise\ngenerated by the seismic field, and to subtract this estimate from the\ngravitational-wave channel of the detector. By using an array of 38 seismic\nsensors, we show that, despite the influence of the complexity of Virgo's\ninfrastructure on the correlation across the array, Wiener filtering can still\nbe very efficient in reconstructing the seismic field around the test-mass\nlocation. Taking into account the division of the building's foundations into\nseparate concrete slabs, and the different properties of the seismic field\nacross them, we conclude that the arrays to be used for the Newtonian-noise\ncancellation at Virgo will require a relatively large number of seismometers\nper test mass, i.e. significantly more than 10.

Motivated by these\nobservations, we propose a new deep generative model-based approach, which\ntrains a shared network twice with different targets and utilizes a single\nnetwork during the testing phase, so that we can effectively save inference\ntime. Specifically, the targets of two training steps are structure\nreconstruction and texture generation respectively.

Then, inspired by the classical bilateral\nfilter [30], we propose the Bilateral Attention layer (BA-layer) to optimize\nfilled feature map, which synthesizes feature patches at each position by\ncomputing weighted sums of the surrounding feature patches, these weights are\nderived by considering both distance and value relationships between feature\npatches, thus making the visually plausible inpainting results.

Elemental abundances are of prime importance to help us reconstruct\nthe origin and evolution of stars and galaxies in our Universe. Sulfur\nabundances have not been as heavily studied as other elements, so some details\nregarding its behaviour are still unclear. Aims. We aim to investigate [S/Fe]\nratios in stars of the solar neighbourhood in order to analyse the chemical\nevolution of sulfur and probe for possible differences in abundances of planet\nhost and non-planet host stars. Methods. We use the code MOOG to perform\nspectral synthesis and derive v*sin(i) values and [S/Fe] ratios for 719 FGK\nstars with high-resolution (R~115000) and high-quality spectra from the\nHARPS-GTO program. We find the best fit and corresponding parameter values by\nperforming chi-square minimisation of the deviation between synthetic profiles\nand observational spectra. Results. Our results reveal that sulfur behaves as a\ntypical alpha-element, with low abundances in young thin disk stars and high\nabundances in old thick disk stars, following what was expected from our\nunderstanding of the Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). Nevertheless, further\nstudies into the abundances of sulfur in very metal-poor stars are required as\nour sample only derived sulfur abundances to stars with metallicity as low as\n[Fe/H]=-1.13 dex. High-alpha metal rich stars are more enhanced in sulfur\ncompared to their thin disk counterparts at the same metallicity. We compare\nour results to GCE models from other authors in the [S/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plane.\nThe [S/Fe]-age relationship is a good proxy for time, just like it is the case\nwith other alpha-elements. We report no differences in the abundances of sulfur\nbetween stars with and without planetary companions in the metallicity range\n[Fe/H] >= -0.3 dex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 15:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

Later, the first author applies this to the particular case\nof coverings of $\\mathbb{P}^2$ reducing the problem to a combination of global\nand local conditions on projective curves.\n  In this paper we extend the above results in three directions: first, the\ntheory is extended to surfaces with quotient singularities, second the\nramification locus can be partially resolved and need not be reduced, and\nfinally global and local conditions are given to describe the irregularity of\ncyclic branched coverings of the weighted projective plane.\n  The techniques required for these results are conceptually different and\nprovide simpler proofs for the classical results. For instance, the local\ncontribution comes from certain modules that have the flavor of\nquasi-adjunction and multiplier ideals on singular surfaces.\n  As an application, a Zariski pair of curves on a singular surface is\ndescribed. In particular, we prove the existence of two cuspidal curves of\ndegree 12 in the weighted projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^2_{(1,1,3)}$ with the\nsame singularities but non-homeomorphic embeddings.

Outflowing air slowly subsides as radiative cooling to\nspace balances adiabatic warming, a process that does not consume any work.\nHowever, we show here that the lateral spread of the outflow is limited by the\nenvironmental deformation radius, which at high latitudes can be rather small.\nIn such cases, the outflowing air is radially constrained, which limits how far\ndownward it can subside via radiative cooling alone. Some literature has\ninvoked the possibility of `mechanical subsidence' or `forced descent' in the\nstorm outflow region in the presence of high inertial stability, which would be\na thermally indirect circulation. Mechanical subsidence in the subsiding branch\nof a tropical cyclone has not before been observed or characterized. A series\nof axisymmetric tropical cyclone simulations at different latitudes and domain\nsizes is conducted to study the impact of environmental inertial stability on\nstorm dynamics. In higher latitude storms in large axisymmetric domains, the\noutflow acts as a wavemaker to excite an inertial wave at the environmental\ninertial (Coriolis) frequency. This inertial wave periodically ventilates the\ncore of a high-latitude storm with its own low entropy exhaust air. The wave\nresponse is in contrast to the presumed forced descent model, and we\nhypothesize that this is because inertial stability provides less resistance\nthan buoyant stability, even in highly inertially stable environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 15:51:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

However, the reliable measurement of the low\npolarization signal from astronomical sources requires a good control of\nspurious instrumental polarization induced by the various components of the\noptical system and the detector. Aims: We perform a detailed multi-wavelength\ncalibration study of the FORS2 instrument at the VLT operating in imaging\npolarimetric mode (IPOL) to characterize the spatial instrumental polarization\nthat may affect the study of extended sources. Methods: We use imaging\npolarimetry of a) high signal-to-noise blank fields BVRI observations during\nfull-moon, when the polarization is expected to be constant across the\nfield-of-view and deviations originate from the instrument and b) a crowded\nstar cluster in broad-band RI and narrow-band H{\\alpha} filters, where\nindividual polarization values of each star across the field can be measured.\nResults: We find an instrumental polarization pattern that increases radially\noutwards from the optical axis of the instrument reaching up to 1.4% at the\nedges, depending on the filter.

In the same period, Wald\n(1939, 1945) initiated his own seminal development of statistical decision\ntheory. Haavelmo favorably cited Wald, but econometrics did not embrace\nstatistical decision theory. Instead, it focused on study of identification,\nestimation, and statistical inference. This paper proposes statistical decision\ntheory as a framework for evaluation of the performance of models in decision\nmaking. I particularly consider the common practice of as-if optimization:\nspecification of a model, point estimation of its parameters, and use of the\npoint estimate to make a decision that would be optimal if the estimate were\naccurate. A central theme is that one should evaluate as-if optimization or any\nother model-based decision rule by its performance across the state space,\nlisting all states of nature that one believes feasible, not across the model\nspace. I apply the theme to prediction and treatment choice.

Locally,\nwhistlers can be excited by two sources of free energy associated with\nanisotropic electrons, i.e., temperature anisotropies and beaming populations\ncarrying the heat flux. However, these two sources of free energy and the\nresulting instabilities are usually studied independently preventing a\nrealistic interpretation of their interplay. This paper presents the results of\na parametric quasilinear study of the whistler instability cumulatively driven\nby two counter-drifting electron populations and their anisotropic\ntemperatures. By comparison to individual regimes dominated either by beaming\npopulation or by temperature anisotropy, in a transitory regime the instability\nbecomes highly conditioned by the effects of both these two sources of free\nenergy. Cumulative effects stimulate the instability and enhance the resulting\nfluctuations, which interact with electrons and stimulate their diffusion in\nvelocity space, leading to a faster and deeper relaxation of the beaming\nvelocity associated with a core heating in perpendicular direction and a\nthermalization of the beaming electrons. In particular, the relaxation of\ntemperature anisotropy to quasi-stable states below the thresholds conditions\npredicted by linear theory may explain the observations showing the\naccumulation of these states near the isotropy and equipartition of energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 17:36:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

The key concept concerningthe quality control of the RFM is\nupdating the RFM according to the newly measured data.

With the\nrecent successes of machine learning techniques such as deep learning, more and\nmore IDS are now using machine learning algorithms to detect attacks faster.\nHowever, these systems lack robustness when facing previously unseen types of\nattacks. With the increasing number of new attacks, especially against Internet\nof Things devices, having a robust IDS able to spot unusual and new attacks\nbecomes necessary.\n  This work explores the possibility of leveraging generative adversarial\nmodels to improve the robustness of machine learning based IDS.

Using Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GAN) and metaheuristics, SIGMA %Our method consists in\ngenerates adversarial examples, iteratively, and uses it to retrain a machine\nlearning-based IDS, until a convergence of the detection rate (i.e. until the\ndetection system is not improving anymore). A round of improvement consists of\na generative phase, in which we use GANs and metaheuristics to generate\ninstances ; an evaluation phase in which we calculate the detection rate of\nthose newly generated attacks ; and a training phase, in which we train the IDS\nwith those attacks. We have evaluated the SIGMA method for four standard\nmachine learning classification algorithms acting as IDS, with a combination of\nGAN and a hybrid local-search and genetic algorithm, to generate new datasets\nof attacks. Our results show that SIGMA can successfully generate adversarial\nattacks against different machine learning based IDS.

In node\nclassification problem, the input is a graph in which the edges represent the\nassociation between pairs of nodes, multi-dimensional feature vectors are\nassociated with the nodes, and some of the nodes in the graph have known\nlabels. The objective is to predict the labels of the nodes that are not\nlabeled, using the nodes features, in conjunction with graph topology. While\nGCNs have been successfully applied to this problem, the caveats that they\ninherit from traditional deep learning models pose significant challenges to\nbroad utilization of GCNs in node classification. One such caveat is that\ntraining a GCN requires a large number of labeled training instances, which is\noften not the case in realistic settings. To remedy this requirement,\nstate-of-the-art methods leverage network diffusion-based approaches to\npropagate labels across the network before training GCNs. However, these\napproaches ignore the tendency of the network diffusion methods in biasing\nproximity with centrality, resulting in the propagation of labels to the nodes\nthat are well-connected in the graph. To address this problem, here we present\nan alternate approach to extrapolating node labels in GCNs in the following\nthree steps: (i) clustering of the network to identify communities, (ii) use of\nnetwork diffusion algorithms to quantify the proximity of each node to the\ncommunities, thereby obtaining a low-dimensional topological profile for each\nnode, (iii) comparing these topological profiles to identify nodes that are\nmost similar to the labeled nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 14:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-23"}

Alternatively, cooperative perception incorporates\ninformation from spatially diverse sensors distributed around the environment\nas a way to mitigate these limitations. This article proposes two schemes for\ncooperative 3D object detection using single modality sensors. The early fusion\nscheme combines point clouds from multiple spatially diverse sensing points of\nview before detection. In contrast, the late fusion scheme fuses the\nindependently detected bounding boxes from multiple spatially diverse sensors.\nWe evaluate the performance of both schemes, and their hybrid combination,\nusing a synthetic cooperative dataset created in two complex driving scenarios,\na T-junction and a roundabout.

This work makes an attempt to predict the driver\nattention in driving accident scenarios (DADA). However, challenges tread on\nthe heels of that because of the dynamic traffic scene, intricate and\nimbalanced accident categories. In this work, we design a semantic context\ninduced attentive fusion network (SCAFNet). We first segment the RGB video\nframes into the images with different semantic regions (i.e., semantic images),\nwhere each region denotes one kind of semantic categories of the scene (e.g.,\nroad, trees, etc.), and learn the spatio-temporal features of RGB frames and\nsemantic images in two parallel paths simultaneously. Then, the learned\nfeatures are fused by an attentive fusion network to find the semantic-induced\nscene variation in driver attention prediction. The contributions are three\nfolds. 1) With the semantic images, we introduce their semantic context\nfeatures and verified the manifest promotion effect for helping the driver\nattention prediction, where the semantic context features are modeled by a\ngraph convolution network (GCN) on semantic images; 2) We fuse the semantic\ncontext features of semantic images and the features of RGB frames in an\nattentive strategy, and the fused details are transferred over frames by a\nconvolutional LSTM module to obtain the attention map of each video frame with\nthe consideration of historical scene variation in driving situations; 3) The\nsuperiority of the proposed method is evaluated on our previously collected\ndataset (named as DADA-2000) and two other challenging datasets with\nstate-of-the-art methods.

We show that the threshold of noise intensity decreases with the\nincreasing of the frequency exponent of power law noise in the parameter space.\nNumerical simulations, such as phase diagram and time history, are employed to\nverify the results acquired by the stochastic Melnikov method.

We compare the properties of cascades in Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi\nnetworks and an exemplary moisture recycling network of the Amazon rainforest.\nWithin these networks, decisive small-scale motifs are the feed forward loop,\nthe secondary feed forward loop, the zero loop and the neighboring loop.\n  Of all motifs, the feed forward loop motif stands out in tipping cascades\nsince it decreases the critical coupling strength necessary to initiate a\ncascade more than the other motifs. We find that for this motif, the reduction\nof critical coupling strength is 11% less than the critical coupling of a pair\nof tipping elements. For highly connected networks, our analysis reveals that\ncoupled feed forward loops coincide with a strong 90% decrease of the critical\ncoupling strength.\n  For the highly clustered moisture recycling network in the Amazon, we observe\nregions of very high motif occurrence for each of the four investigated motifs\nsuggesting that these regions are more vulnerable. The occurrence of motifs is\nfound to be one order of magnitude higher than in a random Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi\nnetwork.\n  This emphasizes the importance of local interaction structures for the\nemergence of global cascades and the stability of the network as a whole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 14:33:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 18:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

The water and oil flow are modeled by an extended version of\nDarcy's law and the substrate is transported by diffusion and convection in the\nwater phase. Initially there is biofilm on the pore walls. The biofilm consumes\nsubstrate for production of biomass and modifies the pore space which changes\nthe rock permeability. The model includes detachment of biomass due to water\nflux and death of bacteria, and is implemented in MRST. We discuss the\ncapability of the numerical simulator to capture results from laboratory\nexperiments. We perform a novel sensitivity analysis based on sparse-grid\ninterpolation and multi-wavelet expansion to identify the critical model\nparameters.

Due to the unique rules, a campaign succeeds in\ntrading only when it collects adequate funds in a given time. To prevent\ncreators and backers from wasting time and efforts on failing campaigns,\ndynamically estimating the success probability of a campaign is very important.\nHowever, existing crowdfunding systems neither have the mechanism of dynamic\npredictive tracking, nor provide the real-time campaign status for creators and\nbackers on the platform. To address these issues, we develop a novel system,\nwhich contains a dynamic data-driven approach to tracking the success\nprobability and status. We demonstrate the following scenarios using our\nsystem. First, users can utilize our system to analyze the emotion of\nincremental reviews so as to understand backers' perspectives of the campaign\nin time. Meanwhile, our system visualizes the statistic number of positive and\nnegative reviews. On this basis, our system can dynamically track the success\nprobability of each campaign.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 15:12:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

Traditionally, the quantum defect in the core\nis taken to be the main source of heating in an active optical fiber. However,\ncontributions from the parasitic absorption of the signal and the pump may also\nplay an important role, especially for low quantum defect or radiation-balanced\nlasers and amplifiers. The contributions to the heating in both the core and\nthe inner-cladding are considered and analyzed in general terms in this paper.\nIn particular, it is shown that if the maximum tolerable surface temperature of\nthe fiber relative to the ambient is taken to be 300 degrees Celsius to avoid\ndamaging the fiber's outer polymer cladding, the core temperature rises only in\nthe range of 0-5 degrees Celsius relative to the inner-cladding for an\nair-cooled fiber. However, for a water-cooled fiber, the core temperature can\nbe higher than the inner-cladding by as much as 50 degrees Celsius, potentially\nchanging a single-mode core to multimode due to the thermo-optic effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 02:13:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 22:21:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 17:09:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}
