Dense arrays of\nqubits benefit from, and may require, access via the third dimension to\nalleviate interconnect crowding. Through-silicon vias (TSVs) represent a\npromising approach to three-dimensional (3D) integration in superconducting\nqubit arrays -- provided they are compact enough to support densely-packed\nqubit systems without compromising qubit performance or low-loss signal and\ncontrol routing. In this work, we demonstrate the integration of\nsuperconducting, high-aspect ratio TSVs -- 10 $\\mu$m wide by 20 $\\mu$m long by\n200 $\\mu$m deep -- with superconducting qubits. We utilize TSVs for baseband\ncontrol and high-fidelity microwave readout of qubits using a two-chip,\nbump-bonded architecture. We also validate the fabrication of qubits directly\nupon the surface of a TSV-integrated chip. These key 3D integration milestones\npave the way for the control and readout of high-density superconducting qubit\narrays using superconducting TSVs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 16:00:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2019 18:09:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 14:07:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

This paper puts forward this\nproblem, referred to as NAS in the wild, which explores the possibility of\nfinding the optimal architecture in a proxy dataset and then deploying it to\nmostly unseen scenarios.\n  We instantiate this setting using a currently popular algorithm named\ndifferentiable architecture search (DARTS), which often suffers unsatisfying\nperformance while being transferred across different tasks.

A\nsimple model of monopole pairing excitations in superfluid nuclei on the basis\nof the semiclassical time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov theory in the limit\nof small amplitudes is considered. Using the anomalous density response\nfunction, the monopole pairing mode in the energy region of double pairing gap\nand the variation of the pairing gap associated with this mode are found. The\nratio of the spectroscopic factor for the excitation of monopole pairing\nvibrations in the (p,t) reaction in even superfluid nuclei to the spectroscopic\nfactor for the transfer of two neutrons to the ground state of the daughter\nnucleus (the relative spectroscopic factor) is estimated. For this, it is\nassumed that the relative spectroscopic factor is proportional to the pairing\ngap variation associated with the monopole pairing vibrations in agreement with\nthe corresponding quantum expression. Numerical estimate of the relative\nspectroscopic factors for superfluid nuclei of the rare-earth and actinide\nregions shows that the spectroscopic factor for the two-neutron transfer,\nleading to the excitation of the monopole pairing vibrations, does not exceed\nseveral percent of the spectroscopic factor for the transfer of two neutrons to\nthe ground state.

They were discovered by their\nextremely strong [OIII]4959+5007 emission lines, which produce a clearly\ndetectable excess brightness in the i bandpass, compared with surrounding\nfilters. We therefore used the HST/COS spectrograph to observe two of the newly\ndiscovered i-band excess galaxies around their Lyman limits. One has strongly\ndetected continuum below its Lyman limit, corresponding to a relative escape\nfraction of ionizing photons of 20+/-2%. The other, which is less compact in UV\nimaging, has a 2-sigma upper limit to its Lyman escape fraction of <5%. Before\nthe UV spectroscopy, the existing data could not distinguish these two\ngalaxies. Although a sample of two is hardly sufficient for statistical\nanalysis, it shows the possibility that some fraction of these strong [OIII]\nemitters as a class have ionizing photons escaping.

Moreover, the absorption\ncoefficient for perpendicular polarization in the visible region is\nsignificantly increased in comparison with the monolayer antimonene. High\nstructural stability, electronic and mechanical robustness against electric\nfield and strain, along with polarization-dependent optical properties of this\nHS, promise for its applications in beam splitters and nano-scale mirrors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 17:10:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2020 16:30:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

In this light, we\ninvestigate network embeddings, i.e., the representation of network nodes as\nlow-dimensional vectors. We consider a typical social network scenario with\nnodes representing users and edges relationships between them. We assume that a\nnetwork embedding of the nodes has been trained. After that, a user demands the\nremoval of his data, requiring the full deletion of the corresponding network\ninformation, in particular the corresponding node and incident edges. In that\nsetting, we analyze whether after the removal of the node from the network and\nthe deletion of the vector representation of the respective node in the\nembedding significant information about the link structure of the removed node\nis still encoded in the embedding vectors of the remaining nodes. This would\nrequire a (potentially computationally expensive) retraining of the embedding.\nFor that purpose, we deploy an attack that leverages information from the\nremaining network and embedding to recover information about the neighbors of\nthe removed node. The attack is based on (i) measuring distance changes in\nnetwork embeddings and (ii) a machine learning classifier that is trained on\nnetworks that are constructed by removing additional nodes. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that substantial information about the edges of a removed node/user\ncan be retrieved across many different datasets. This implies that to fully\nprotect the privacy of users, node deletion requires complete retraining - or\nat least a significant modification - of original network embeddings. Our\nresults suggest that deleting the corresponding vector representation from\nnetwork embeddings alone is not sufficient from a privacy perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 17:10:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

In this paper, we present a unified\nframework for developing global rational approximants of\n$E_{\\alpha,\\beta}(-x)$, $x>0$, with $\\{ (\\alpha,\\beta): 0 < \\alpha \\leq 1,\n\\beta \\geq \\alpha, (\\alpha,\\beta) \\ne (1,1) \\}$. This framework is based on the\nseries definition and the asymptotic expansion at infinity. In particular, we\ndevelop three types of fourth-order global rational approximations and discuss\nhow they could be used to approximate the inverse function. Unlike existing\napproximations which are either limited to MLF of one parameter or of low\naccuracy for the two-parametric MLF, our rational approximants are of fourth\norder accuracy and have low percentage error globally. For efficient\nutilization, we study the partial fraction decomposition and use them to\napproximate the two-parametric MLF with a matrix argument which arise in the\nsolutions of fractional evolution differential and integral equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 17:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

It is, in part, caused by the\npresence of highly r-process enriched stars, classified as r-II stars\n([Eu/Fe]>+1). In parallel, halo stars show that the ratio of a light r-process\nelement (Y) to Eu is tightly correlated with [Eu/Fe], giving the lowest [Y/Eu]\nratio that levels off at r-II stars. On the other hand, recent hydrodynamical\nsimulations of coalescing double neutron stars (cNSNSs) have suggested that\nr-process sites may be separated into two classes providing different\nelectron-fraction distributions: tidally-driven dynamical ejecta and (dynamical\nor postmerger) non-tidal ejecta.

This anisotropy drives a viscous stress parallel to the\nfield that inhibits the plasma's ability to stretch magnetic-field lines. I\ndemonstrate through the use of kinetic simulations that in high-$\\beta$\nplasmas, kinetic ion-Larmor scale instabilities sever the adiabatic link\nbetween the thermal and magnetic pressures, reducing this viscous stress and\nthereby allowing the dynamo to operate. Two distinct regimes of the fluctuation\ndynamo in a magnetized plasma are identified: one in which these instabilities\nefficiently regulate the pressure anisotropy and one in which this regulation\nis imperfect. I elucidate the role of these kinetic instabilities on the plasma\nviscosity and determine how the fields and flows self-organize to allow the\ndynamo to operate in the face of parallel viscous stresses. In the case of\nefficient pressure-anisotropy regulation, the plasma dynamo closely resembles\nits more traditional Pm ~ 1 MHD counterpart. When the regulation is imperfect,\nthe dynamo exhibits characteristics remarkably similar to those found in the\nsaturated state of the MHD dynamo. A novel set of microphysical closures for\nfluid simulations that bridges these two regimes are constructed, exhibiting\nexplosive magnetic-field growth caused by a field-strength-dependent viscosity.\nThe dynamos in both collisionless and weakly collisional plasmas are then\nclosely compared to each other, revealing substantial differences in how\nsub-parallel viscous motions behave. The former (collisionless) scenario\nexperiences a cascade of stretching motions to sub-Larmor scales that lead to\nincreasingly fast dynamo as the magnetic Reynolds number is increased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 19:24:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-25"}

Decades of developments of numerical simulation of visco-elastic\nwave equations in seismology are mainly based on constant Q model, leading to\nnumerous different forms of time-domain visco-elastic wave equations. Based on\nrheological models, Emmerich and Korn (1987) adopted the Generalized Maxwell\nbody (GMB) to implement visco-elastic wave equations in time domain. Carcione,\nKosloff, and Kosloff (1988a) incorporated the Generalized Zener body (GZB) into\nthe time-domain visco-elastic wave equation.

Mainardi (2010) first mentioned that the constant Q model\nis based on a fractional Scott-Blair model. The stress-strain relationship of\nthe Scott-Blair model is between a spring and a dashpot. Therefore, we review\nthe various visco-elastic wave equations in the text of seismology.

In this paper, we propose an Ensemble-based\nFraud Detection (EnsemFDet) method to scale up fraud detection in bipartite\ngraphs by decomposing the original problem into subproblems on small-sized\nsubgraphs. By oversampling the graph and solving the subproblems, the ensemble\napproach further votes suspicious nodes without sacrificing the prediction\naccuracy. Extensive experiments have been done on real transaction data from\nJD.com, which is one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness, practicability, and scalability of\nEnsemFDet. More specifically, EnsemFDet is up to 100x faster than the\nstate-of-the-art methods due to its parallelism with all aspects of data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 21:19:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 03:44:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 06:29:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 00:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-09"}

Three\nlevels of neural networks are used, with the goal of predicting the future\nstate of a system of interest in a parametric setting. A convolutional\nautoencoder is used as the top level to encode the high dimensional input data\nalong spatial dimensions into a sequence of latent variables. A temporal\nconvolutional autoencoder (TCAE) serves as the second level, which further\nencodes the output sequence from the first level along the temporal dimension,\nand outputs a set of latent variables that encapsulate the spatio-temporal\nevolution of the dynamics. The use of dilated temporal convolutions grows the\nreceptive field exponentially with network depth, allowing for efficient\nprocessing of long temporal sequences typical of scientific computations. A\nfully-connected network is used as the third level to learn the mapping between\nthese latent variables and the global parameters from training data, and\npredict them for new parameters. For future state predictions, the second level\nuses a temporal convolutional network to predict subsequent steps of the output\nsequence from the top level. Latent variables at the bottom-most level are\ndecoded to obtain the dynamics in physical space at new global parameters\nand/or at a future time.

To illustrate this, we describe two biologically\ninspired methods for decoding R and R', referred to as sigma and sigma-chi\ndecoding, respectively.

The popularity of the approach stems from its\nflexibility to effectively operate in networks with diverse characteristics\nwithout requiring special customization. Nonetheless, its drawback is the\ntendency to produce a high number of replicas that consume limited resources\nsuch as energy and storage. To tackle the problem we make the observation that\nnetwork nodes can be grouped, based on their utility values, into clusters that\nportray different delivery capabilities. We exploit this finding to transform\nthe basic forwarding strategy, which is to move a packet using nodes of\nincreasing utility, and actually forward it through clusters of increasing\ndelivery capability. The new strategy works in synergy with the basic dynamic\nreplication algorithms and is fully configurable, in the sense that it can be\nused with virtually any utility function. We also extend our approach to work\nwith two utility functions at the same time, a feature that is especially\nefficient in mobile networks that exhibit social characteristics. By conducting\nexperiments in a wide set of real-life networks, we empirically show that our\nmethod is robust in reducing the overall number of replicas in networks with\ndiverse connectivity characteristics without at the same time hindering\ndelivery efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 23:46:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 13:43:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

While these topological states\nat a surface, i.e., a topological insulator-air/vacuum interface, have been\nstudied intensely, topological states at a solid-solid interface have been less\nexplored. Here we combine experiment and theory to study such \\textit{embedded}\ntopological states (ETSs) in heterostructures of GeTe (normal insulator) and\nSb$_2$Te$_3$ (topological insulator). We analyse their dependence on the\ninterface and their confinement characteristics.

We then use first-principles to independently calculate the\nband offset and also parametrise the band structure within a four-band\ncontinuum model.

While most of the existing methods for adversarial attack and defense\nwork on the 2D image domain, a few recent attempts have been made to extend\nthem to 3D point cloud data. However, adversarial results obtained by these\nmethods typically contain point outliers, which are both noticeable and easy to\ndefend against using the simple techniques of outlier removal. Motivated by the\ndifferent mechanisms by which humans perceive 2D images and 3D shapes, in this\npaper we propose the new design of \\emph{geometry-aware objectives}, whose\nsolutions favor (the discrete versions of) the desired surface properties of\nsmoothness and fairness. To generate adversarial point clouds, we use a\ntargeted attack misclassification loss that supports continuous pursuit of\nincreasingly malicious signals. Regularizing the targeted attack loss with our\nproposed geometry-aware objectives results in our proposed method,\nGeometry-Aware Adversarial Attack ($GeoA^3$). The results of $GeoA^3$ tend to\nbe more harmful, arguably harder to defend against, and of the key adversarial\ncharacterization of being imperceptible to humans. While the main focus of this\npaper is to learn to generate adversarial point clouds, we also present a\nsimple but effective algorithm termed $Geo_{+}A^3$-IterNormPro, with Iterative\nNormal Projection (IterNorPro) that solves a new objective function\n$Geo_{+}A^3$, towards surface-level adversarial attacks via generation of\nadversarial point clouds. We quantitatively evaluate our methods on both\nsynthetic and physical objects in terms of attack success rate and geometric\nregularity.

Because image\nannotations are cheaper and quicker to generate, weak supervision is more\npractical than full supervision for training segmentation algorithms. These\nmethods have been predominantly developed to solve the background separation\nand partial segmentation problems presented by natural scene images and it is\nunclear whether they can be simply transferred to other domains with different\ncharacteristics, such as histopathology and satellite images, and still perform\nwell. This paper evaluates state-of-the-art weakly-supervised semantic\nsegmentation methods on natural scene, histopathology, and satellite image\ndatasets and analyzes how to determine which method is most suitable for a\ngiven dataset. Our experiments indicate that histopathology and satellite\nimages present a different set of problems for weakly-supervised semantic\nsegmentation than natural scene images, such as ambiguous boundaries and class\nco-occurrence. Methods perform well for datasets they were developed on, but\ntend to perform poorly on other datasets. We present some practical techniques\nfor these methods on unseen datasets and argue that more work is needed for a\ngeneralizable approach to weakly-supervised semantic segmentation.

Recently, human-designed data augmentation has\nbeen gradually replaced by automatically learned augmentation policy. Through\nfinding the best policy in well-designed search space of data augmentation,\nAutoAugment can significantly improve validation accuracy on image\nclassification tasks. However, this approach is not computationally practical\nfor large-scale problems. In this paper, we develop an adversarial method to\narrive at a computationally-affordable solution called Adversarial AutoAugment,\nwhich can simultaneously optimize target related object and augmentation policy\nsearch loss. The augmentation policy network attempts to increase the training\nloss of a target network through generating adversarial augmentation policies,\nwhile the target network can learn more robust features from harder examples to\nimprove the generalization. In contrast to prior work, we reuse the computation\nin target network training for policy evaluation, and dispense with the\nretraining of the target network.

The first, which we call stochastic\nfairness, is classical, and assumes an environment which operates\nprobabilistically using possibly unknown probabilities. The second, which is\nlanguage-theoretic, assumes that if an action is taken from a given state\ninfinitely often then all its possible outcomes should appear infinitely often\n(we call this state-action fairness). While the two notions coincide for\nstandard reachability goals, they diverge for temporally extended goals. This\nimportant difference has been overlooked in the planning literature, and we\nargue has led to confusion in a number of published algorithms which use\nreductions that were stated for state-action fairness, for which they are\nincorrect, while being correct for stochastic fairness. We remedy this and\nprovide an optimal sound and complete algorithm for solving state-action fair\nplanning for LTL/LTLf goals, as well as a correct proof of the lower bound of\nthe goal-complexity (our proof is general enough that it provides new proofs\nalso for the no-fairness and stochastic-fairness cases).

However,\nsuch reconciliation between node burstiness and link burstiness cannot be\nexplained if the interaction processes on different links are independent of\neach other. This is because the activity of a node is the superposition of the\ninteraction processes on the links incident to the node and the superposition\nof independent bursty point processes is not bursty in general.

This hinders the application of RSVM to large-scale problems. Safe\nsample screening that allows for the exclusion of training samples prior to or\nearly in the training process is an effective method to greatly reduce\ncomputational time. However, existing safe sample screening algorithms are\nlimited to convex optimization problems while RSVM is a non-convex problem.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of safe sample\nscreening to a non-convex optimization problem. More importantly, we provide\nthe security guarantee to our sample screening rules to RSVM.

Existing techniques have focused on exploiting either the static\nnature of sketches with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or the temporal\nsequential property with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In this work, we\npropose a new representation of sketches as multiple sparsely connected graphs.\nWe design a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN), the Multi-Graph Transformer\n(MGT), for learning representations of sketches from multiple graphs which\nsimultaneously capture global and local geometric stroke structures, as well as\ntemporal information. We report extensive numerical experiments on a sketch\nrecognition task to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.\nParticularly, MGT applied on 414k sketches from Google QuickDraw: (i) achieves\nsmall recognition gap to the CNN-based performance upper bound (72.80% vs.\n74.22%), and (ii) outperforms all RNN-based models by a significant margin.

First,\neach class in the image is modelled as a specific nonlinear manifold and the\ngeodesic distance is used to measure the correlation between the samples. Then,\nbased on the hierarchical clustering, the manifold structure of the data can be\ncaptured and each nonlinear data manifold can be divided into several\nsub-classes. Finally, considering the distribution of each sub-class and the\ncorrelation between different subclasses, the DMEM is constructed to preserve\nthe estimated geodesic distances on the data manifold between the learned low\ndimensional features of different samples.

More precisely, given any initial map along which the Dirac\noperator has nontrivial minimal kernel, we first prove the short time existence\nof the heat flow for $\\alpha$-Dirac-harmonic maps. The obstacle to the global\nexistence is the singular time when the kernel of the Dirac operator no longer\nstays minimal along the flow. In this case, the kernel may not be continuous\neven if the map is smooth with respect to time. To overcome this issue, we use\nthe analyticity of the target manifold to obtain the density of the maps along\nwhich the Dirac operator has minimal kernel in the homotopy class of the given\ninitial map. Then, when we arrive at the singular time, this density allows us\nto pick another map which has lower energy to restart the flow. Thus, we get a\nflow which may not be continuous at a set of isolated points. Furthermore, with\nthe help of small energy regularity and blow-up analysis, we finally get the\nexistence of nontrivial $\\alpha$-Dirac-harmonic maps ($\\alpha\\geq1$) from\nclosed surfaces.

The transport coefficients parameterising\nthe vector charge density and axial current are calculated both analytically\n(in the weak magnetic field limit) and also numerically (for general values of\nthe magnetic field). We find the generation of vector charge receives both\nnon-anomalous and anomalous contributions, with the non-anomalous contribution\ndominating in the limit of strong magnetic field and the anomalous contribution\nsensitive to both chiral anomaly and gravitational anomaly.

The\ncorresponding chiral vortical conductivity is found to be suppressed by the\nmagnetic field.

Despite its advantages, this approach has\nmany known privacy and security weaknesses and performance overhead, in\naddition to being limited only to models with homogeneous architectures. Shared\nparameters leak a significant amount of information about the local (and\nsupposedly private) datasets. Besides, federated learning is severely\nvulnerable to poisoning attacks, where some participants can adversarially\ninfluence the aggregate parameters. Large models, with high dimensional\nparameter vectors, are in particular highly susceptible to privacy and security\nattacks: curse of dimensionality in federated learning. We argue that sharing\nparameters is the most naive way of information exchange in collaborative\nlearning, as they open all the internal state of the model to inference\nattacks, and maximize the model's malleability by stealthy poisoning attacks.\nWe propose Cronus, a robust collaborative machine learning framework. The\nsimple yet effective idea behind designing Cronus is to control, unify, and\nsignificantly reduce the dimensions of the exchanged information between\nparties, through robust knowledge transfer between their black-box local\nmodels. We evaluate all existing federated learning algorithms against\npoisoning attacks, and we show that Cronus is the only secure method, due to\nits tight robustness guarantee. Treating local models as black-box, reduces the\ninformation leakage through models, and enables us using existing\nprivacy-preserving algorithms that mitigate the risk of information leakage\nthrough the model's output (predictions). Cronus also has a significantly lower\nsample complexity, compared to federated learning, which does not bind its\nsecurity to the number of participants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2019 10:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-25"}

We illustrate our approach along an\noptimization of the well-known iterative Fibonacci program, which, typically,\nis considered to lack any optimization potential. The point here is that our\ntechnique supports loop unrolling as a first class optimization technique and\nis tailored to optimally aggregate large program fragments, especially those\nresulting from multiple loop unrollings.

We provide experimental evidence that the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal\nstructural phase transition in a single layer of 20-nm-sized 3D MAPbBr3\nnanocrystals is spread out within the 70 - 140 K range. This structural phase\ninstability range arises because, unlike in single-crystal MAPbX3, free\nrotations of MA ions in the corresponding nanocrystals are no longer restricted\nby a long-range MA dipole order. The resulting configurational entropy loss can\nbe even enhanced by the interfacial electric field arising due to charge\nseparation at the MAPbBr3/ZnO heterointerface, extending the\northorhombic-to-tetragonal structural phase instability range from 70 to 230 K.\nWe conclude that the weak sensitivity of conventional one-photon-excited PL\nspectroscopy to the structural phase transitions in 3D MAPbX3 nanocrystals\nresults from the structural phase instability providing negligible distortions\nof PbX6 octahedra.

Experiments both with and without clouds are examined.

In\ncontrast, the global-mean surface temperature simulation in the M-star case is\nhighly divergent (20-30 K). Moreover, even differences in the simulated surface\ntemperature when clouds are turned off are significant. These differences are\ncaused by differences in cloud simulation and/or radiative transfer, as well as\ncomplex interactions between atmospheric dynamics and these two processes. For\nexample we find that an increase in atmospheric absorption of shortwave\nradiation can lead to higher relative humidity at high altitudes globally and,\ntherefore, a significant decrease in planetary radiation emitted to space.

On paper, the large excess of base\nstation (BS) antennas promises unprecedented spectral efficiency gains.\nUnfortunately, during the initial phase of industrial testing, a practical\nchallenge arose which threatens to undermine the actual deployment of massive\nMIMO: user mobility-induced channel Doppler. In fact, testing teams reported\nthat in moderate-mobility scenarios, e.g., 30 km/h of user equipment (UE)\nspeed, the performance drops up to 50% compared to the low-mobility scenario, a\nproblem rooted in the acute sensitivity of massive MIMO to this channel\nDoppler, and not foreseen by many theoretical papers on the subject. In order\nto deal with this \"curse of mobility\", we propose a novel form of channel\nprediction method, named Prony-based angular-delay domain (PAD) prediction,\nwhich is built on exploiting the specific angle-delay-Doppler structure of the\nmultipath. In particular, our method relies on the high angular-delay\nresolution which arises in the context of 5G. Our theoretical analysis shows\nthat when the number of base station antennas and the bandwidth are large, the\nprediction error of our PAD algorithm converges to zero for any UE velocity\nlevel, provided that only two accurate enough previous channel samples are\navailable. Moreover, when the channel samples are inaccurate, we propose to\ncombine the PAD algorithm with a denoising method for channel estimation phase\nbased on the subspace structure and the long-term statistics of the channel\nobservations.

This approach is known as moving target defense (MTD). However,\ndespite of the deployment of MTD, it is still possible for the attacker to\nlaunch stealthy FDI attacks generated with former branch susceptances. In this\npaper, we prove that, an MTD has the capability to thwart all FDI attacks\nconstructed with former branch susceptances only if (i) the number of branches\n$l$ in the power system is not less than twice that of the system states $n$\n(i.e., $l \\geq 2n$, where $n + 1$ is the number of buses); (ii) the\nsusceptances of more than $n$ branches, which cover all buses, are perturbed.\nMoreover, we prove that the state variable of a bus that is only connected by a\nsingle branch (no matter it is perturbed or not) can always be modified by the\nattacker.

Its principle is based on mapping\ndistance to frequency, and to simultaneously measure the Doppler shift of\nreflected light using frequency chirped signals, similar to Sonar or Radar.\nYet, despite these advantages, coherent ranging exhibits lower acquisition\nspeed and requires precisely chirped and highly-coherent laser sources,\nhindering their widespread use and impeding Parallelization, compared to modern\ntime-of-flight (TOF) ranging that use arrays of individual lasers. Here we\ndemonstrate a novel massively parallel coherent LIDAR scheme using a photonic\nchip-based microcomb. By fast chirping the pump laser in the soliton existence\nrange of a microcomb with amplitudes up to several GHz and sweep rate up to 10\nMHz, the soliton pulse stream acquires a rapid change in the underlying carrier\nwaveform, while retaining its pulse-to-pulse repetition rate. As a result, the\nchirp from a single narrow-linewidth pump laser is simultaneously transferred\nto all spectral comb teeth of the soliton at once, and allows for true\nparallelism in FMCW LIDAR. We demonstrate this approach by generating 30\ndistinct channels, demonstrating both parallel distance and velocity\nmeasurements at an equivalent rate of 3 Mpixel/s, with potential to improve\nsampling rates beyond 150 Mpixel/s and increase the image refresh rate of FMCW\nLIDAR up to two orders of magnitude without deterioration of eye safety.

While radiative cooling of interstellar grains is a well-known\nprocess, little detail is known about the cooling of grains with an icy mantle\nthat contains volatile adsorbed molecules. Aims. We explore basic details for\nthe cooling process of an icy grain with properties relevant to dark\ninterstellar clouds. Methods. Grain cooling was described with a numerical code\nconsidering a grain with an icy mantle that is structured in monolayers and\ncontaining several volatile species in proportions consistent with interstellar\nice. Evaporation was treated as first-order decay. Diffusion and subsequent\nthermal desorption of bulk-ice species was included. Temperature decrease from\ninitial temperatures of 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, and 20K was studied,\nand we also followed the composition of ice and evaporated matter. Results. We\nfind that grain cooling occurs by partially successive and partially\noverlapping evaporation of different species. The most volatile molecules (N2)\nfirst evaporate at the greatest rate and are most rapidly depleted from the\nouter ice monolayers. The most important coolant is CO, but evaporation of more\nrefractory species, such as CH4 and even CO2, is possible when the former\nvolatiles are not available. Cooling of high-temperature grains takes longer\nbecause volatile molecules are depleted faster and the grain has to switch to\nslow radiative cooling at a higher temperature. For grain temperatures above\n40K, most of the thermal energy is carried away by evaporation. Evaporation of\nthe nonpolar volatile species induces a complete change of the ice surface, as\nthe refractory polar molecules (H2O) are left behind. Conclusions. The\neffectiveness of thermal desorption from heated icy grains (e.g., the yield of\ncosmic-ray-induced desorption) is primarily controlled by the thermal energy\ncontent of the grain and the number and availability of volatile molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2019 14:24:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 16:29:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

The initial exploration of the parameter space can be a\nforbiddingly expensive task. A different approach is proposed here that does\nnot require any parameter sampling or exploration of the parameter space.\nInstead, we represent the system response in terms of four subsystems that are\nnonparametric. One may apply any one of a number of standard (nonparametric)\nmodel reduction strategies to reduce the subsystems independently, and then\nconjoin these reduced models with the underlying parameterized representation\nto obtain an overall parameterized response. Our approach has elements in\ncommon with the parameter mapping approach of Baur et al. [8], but offers\ngreater flexibility and potentially greater control over accuracy. In\nparticular, a data-driven variation of our approach is described that exercises\nthis flexibility through the use of limited frequency-sampling of the\nunderlying nonparametric models. The parametric structure of our system\nrepresentation allows for a priori guarantees of system stability the resulting\nparametric reduced models, uniformly across all parameter values.

It is well known, due to chiral symmetry breaking, there are at least\ntwo very different QCD vacua. At T=0 and in the true vacuum, the scalar and\npseudoscalar, or the vector and axial vector are not degenerate, and in the\nchiral limit, the pseudoscalar ground states are Goldstone bosons. At T=0 the\nchiral invariant vacuum is an unstable vacuum, decaying through an infinite\nnumber of scalar and pseudoscalar tachyons. Moreover QCD vacuum replicas, an\ninfinite tower of excited vacuum solutions, which energy density lies between\nthe true vacuum and the chiral invariant vacuum, have been predicted in the\nCoulomb gauge, due to the non-linearity of the mass gap equation with a\nconfining interaction. It remained to show whether the QCD replicas are\nmetastable or unstable. In this paper the spectrum of quark-antiquark systems,\nis studied in the true vacuum and in the first excited QCD replicas. The mass\ngap equation for the vacua and the Salpeter-RPA equation for the mesons are\nsolved for a simple chiral invariant and confining quark model approximating\nQCD in the Coulomb gauge.

Students suffer from difficulties in\nderiving, justifying, or interpreting the identities, misconceptions about\npartial derivatives, and a lack of in-depth understanding of the meanings of\nidentities. We propose a novel diagrammatic method for the calculus of\ndifferentials and partial derivatives called the \"sunray diagram\" that resolves\nthe difficulties above. The sunray diagram technique relates a partial\nderivative with \"arrow sliding,\" which enables an aesthetic and intuitive\nmanipulation of partial derivative expressions in the form of successive arrow\nslidings. Furthermore, the sunray diagram is more than an ad hoc or abstract\nmachinery but is based on the symplectic structure of thermodynamics; the\nsunray diagram admits a direct physical interpretation on the P-V (or T-S)\nplane. We elaborate on such physical semantics of the sunray diagram by taking\nMaxwell's approach to the geometry of thermodynamic structures--reinterpreted\nin terms of differential geometry--as a reference point. We anticipate that our\ndiscussion introduces the geometry of thermodynamics to learners and enriches\nthe graphical pedagogy in physics education.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2019 14:31:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 14:00:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2020 11:25:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 20:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

Finally, the category-relevant losses in both scenarios\nare reformulated using filtered soft labels, while the category-irrelevant MMD\nloss in CSDA is reformulated as a form like class-wise MMD using newly-designed\nimportance filtered soft labels.

We find that charge injection in metallic\n1T'-WTe2/1T'-MoTe2 junctions is nearly ideal as electrode Bloch states remain\ndelocalized through the channel. Mixtures of 1T' selenides and tellurides\ndepart from this scenario due to the momentum mismatch between states in the\nlead and channel.

They have also been\nsuccessfully used in Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender systems to\npredict missing ratings. Unfortunately, like all black box machine learning\nmodels, they are unable to explain their outputs. Hence, while predictions from\nan Autoencoder-based recommender system might be accurate, it might not be\nclear to the user why a recommendation was generated. In this work, we design\nan explainable recommendation system using an Autoencoder model whose\npredictions can be explained using the neighborhood based explanation style.\nOur preliminary work can be considered to be the first step towards an\nexplainable deep learning architecture based on Autoencoders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 23:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-14"}

The objective\nis to achieve a solution in which the ultimate beneficiaries are the prosumers,\ni.e., a prosumer-centric solution. To do so, a coalition formation game is\ndesigned, which enables a prosumer to compare its benefit of participating in\nthe peer-to-peer trading with and without using its battery and thus, allows\nthe prosumer to form suitable social coalition groups with other similar\nprosumers in the network for conducting peer-to-peer trading. The properties of\nthe formed coalitions are studied, and it is shown that 1) the coalition\nstructure that stems from the social cooperation between participating\nprosumers at each time slot is both stable and optimal, and 2) the outcomes of\nthe proposed peer- to-peer trading scheme is prosumer-centric. Case studies are\nconducted based on real household energy usage and solar generation data to\nhighlight how the proposed scheme can benefit prosumers through exhibiting\nprosumer-centric properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2019 12:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-24"}
