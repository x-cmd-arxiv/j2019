The DOT path-conservative scheme is a robust upwind method based on a\ncomplete Riemann solver, but it has the drawback of requiring expensive\nnumerical computations. Indeed, to compute the non-linear time evolution in\neach time step, the DOT scheme requires numerical computation of the flux\nmatrix eigenstructure (the totality of eigenvalues and eigenvectors) several\ntimes at each cell edge. In this work, an analytical and compact formulation of\nthe eigenstructure for the de Saint Venant-Exner (dSVE) model is introduced and\ntested in terms of numerical efficiency and stability. Using the original DOT\nand PRICE-C (a very efficient FORCE-type method) as reference methods, we\npresent a convergence analysis (error against CPU time) to study the\nperformance of the DOT method with our new analytical implementation of\neigenstructure calculations (A-DOT). In particular, the numerical performance\nof the three methods is tested in three test cases: a movable bed Riemann\nproblem with an analytical solution; a problem with smooth analytical solution;\na test in which the water flow is characterised by subcritical and\nsupercritical regions. For a given target error, the A-DOT method is always the\nmost efficient choice.

Conventional 2D convolutions are\nunsuitable for this task because they fail to capture local object and its\nscale information, which are vital for 3D object detection. To better represent\n3D structure, prior arts typically transform depth maps estimated from 2D\nimages into a pseudo-LiDAR representation, and then apply existing 3D\npoint-cloud based object detectors. However, their results depend heavily on\nthe accuracy of the estimated depth maps, resulting in suboptimal performance.\nIn this work, instead of using pseudo-LiDAR representation, we improve the\nfundamental 2D fully convolutions by proposing a new local convolutional\nnetwork (LCN), termed Depth-guided Dynamic-Depthwise-Dilated LCN (D$^4$LCN),\nwhere the filters and their receptive fields can be automatically learned from\nimage-based depth maps, making different pixels of different images have\ndifferent filters. D$^4$LCN overcomes the limitation of conventional 2D\nconvolutions and narrows the gap between image representation and 3D point\ncloud representation. Extensive experiments show that D$^4$LCN outperforms\nexisting works by large margins. For example, the relative improvement of\nD$^4$LCN against the state-of-the-art on KITTI is 9.1\\% in the moderate\nsetting.

Existing approaches are designed\nto investigate accidents in lane-based traffic. However, such approaches are\nnot suitable in a lane-less mixed-traffic environment where vehicles often ply\nvery close to each other. Hence, we propose an approach called Siamese\nInteraction Long Short-Term Memory network (SILSTM) to detect collision prone\nvehicle behavior. The SILSTM network learns the interaction trajectory of a\nvehicle that describes the interactions of a vehicle with its neighbors at an\nintersection. Among the hundreds of interactions for every vehicle, there maybe\nonly some interactions which may be unsafe and hence, a temporal attention\nlayer is used in the SILSTM network. Furthermore, the comparison of interaction\ntrajectories requires labeling the trajectories as either unsafe or safe, but\nsuch a distinction is highly subjective, especially in lane-less traffic.\nHence, in this work, we compute the characteristics of interaction trajectories\ninvolved in accidents using the collision energy model. The interaction\ntrajectories that match accident characteristics are labeled as unsafe while\nthe rest are considered safe. Finally, there is no existing dataset that allows\nus to monitor a particular intersection for a long duration. Therefore, we\nintroduce the SkyEye dataset that contains 1 hour of continuous aerial footage\nfrom each of the 4 chosen intersections in the city of Ahmedabad in India.

They tend to be small in size\nand core-dominated, but the origin of their properties and the evolution of\ntheir radio plasma are not well constrained. Interestingly, there is mounting\nevidence that low-power radio sources can significantly impact their\nsurrounding gaseous medium and, therefore, may be more relevant for galaxy\nevolution than previously thought. In this paper, we present low radio\nfrequency observations obtained with LOFAR at 147 MHz of the radio source\nhosted by NGC 3998. This is a rare example of a low-power source which is\nextremely core-dominated, but which has two large-scale lobes of low surface\nbrightness. We combine the new 147 MHz image with available 1400 MHz data to\nderive the spectral index over the source. Despite the low surface brightness,\nreminiscent of remnant structures, the lobes show an optically thin synchrotron\nspectral index (~ 0.6). We interpret this as being due to rapid decollimation\nof the jets close to the core, to high turbulence of the plasma flow, and\nentrainment of thermal gas. This could be the result of intermittent activity\nof the central AGN, or, more likely, temporary disruption of the jet due to the\ninteraction of the jet with the rich circumnuclear ISM. Both would result in\nsputtering energy injection from the core which would keep the lobes fed,\nalbeit at a low rate. We discuss these results in connection with the\nproperties of low-power radio sources in general. Our findings show that\namorphous, low surface brightness lobes should not be interpreted, by default,\nas remnant structures. Large, deep surveys (in particular the LOFAR 150 MHz\nLoTSS and the recently started 1400 MHz Apertif survey) will identify a growing\nnumber of objects similar to NGC 3998 where these ideas can be further tested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 16:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

We examined TiO2 and SnO2 IOs\nin a range of common solvents to solve the conflict between Bragg-Snell theory,\noptical and physical measurements by a comprehensive angle-resolved light\ntransmission study coupled to microscopy examination of the IO structure.\nTuning the position of the photonic bandgap and index contrast by solvent\ninfiltration of each inverse opal requires a modification to the Bragg-Snell\ntheory and the photonic crystal unit cell definition. We also demonstrate\nexperimentally and theroetically that low fill factors are caused by less desne\nmaterial infilling all interstitial vancancies in the opal template to form an\nIO. By also including an optical interference condition for inverse opals with\nan effective refractive index greater than its substrate, and an alternative\ninternal refraction angle in the substrate, angle-resolved transmission spectra\nfor inverse opals are now consistent with physical measurements. This work now\nallows an accurate correlation between the true response of an IO to the index\ncontrast with a solvent, how an IO is infilled, and the directionality and\nbandwidth of the photonic bandgap. As control in functional photonic materials\nbecomes more prevalent outside of optics and photonics, such as biosensing and\nenergy storage, for example, a comprehensive and consistent correlation between\nphotonic crystals structures and their primary optical signatures is a\nfundamental requirement for application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 16:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Here we use a neural\nnetwork-based architecture for symbolic regression called the Equation Learner\n(EQL) network and integrate it with other deep learning architectures such that\nthe whole system can be trained end-to-end through backpropagation. To\ndemonstrate the power of such systems, we study their performance on several\nsubstantially different tasks. First, we show that the neural network can\nperform symbolic regression and learn the form of several functions. Next, we\npresent an MNIST arithmetic task where a separate part of the neural network\nextracts the digits. Finally, we demonstrate prediction of dynamical systems\nwhere an unknown parameter is extracted through an encoder. We find that the\nEQL-based architecture can extrapolate quite well outside of the training data\nset compared to a standard neural network-based architecture, paving the way\nfor deep learning to be applied in scientific exploration and discovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 17:07:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 18:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

In this paper, we employ bandgap engineering to\nsynthesize hydrogenated amorphous Si nanoparticles (a-Si:H NPs) offering ideal\nfeatures for functional nanophotonics.

One important\nadvantage of our M&U pruning criterion is that it is scale-invariant, a\nphenomenon that the magnitude-based pruning criterion suffers from. In\naddition, we present a ``pseudo bootstrap'' scheme, which can efficiently\nestimate the uncertainty of the weights by using their update information\nduring training. Our experimental evaluation, which is based on various neural\nnetwork architectures and datasets, shows that our new criterion leads to more\ncompressed models compared to models that are solely based on magnitude-based\npruning criteria, with, at the same time, less loss in predictive power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 17:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

In\nstandard x-space approach to MPI, the image is reconstructed by gridding the\nspeed-compensated nanoparticle signal to the instantaneous position of the\nfield free point (FFP). However, due to safety limits on the drive field, the\nfield-of-view (FOV) needs to be covered by multiple relatively small partial\nfield-of-views (pFOVs). The image of the entire FOV is then pieced together\nfrom individually processed pFOVs. These processing steps can be sensitive to\nnon-ideal signal conditions such as harmonic interference, noise, and\nrelaxation effects. In this work, we propose a robust x-space reconstruction\ntechnique, Partial FOV Center Imaging (PCI), with substantially simplified pFOV\nprocessing. PCI first forms a raw image of the entire FOV by mapping MPI signal\ndirectly to pFOV center locations. The corresponding MPI image is then obtained\nby deconvolving this raw image by a fully known, compact kernel, which solely\ndepends on the pFOV size. We analyze the performance of the proposed\nreconstruction via extensive simulations, as well as imaging experiments on our\nin-house FFP MPI scanner. The results show that PCI offers a trade-off between\nnoise robustness and interference robustness, outperforming standard x-space\nreconstruction in terms of both robustness against non-ideal signal conditions\nand image quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 17:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

This paper continues the study\noriginated by Efimov, Adamyan and Spokoiny (2019) where a novel approach to\nadaptive nonparametric clustering called Adaptive Weights Clustering (AWC) was\noffered. The method allows analyzing high-dimensional data with an unknown\nnumber of unbalanced clusters of arbitrary shape under very weak modeling\nassumptions. The procedure demonstrates a state-of-the-art performance and is\nvery efficient even for large data dimension D.

This paper makes a significant step in\nunderstanding the remarkable performance of the AWC procedure, particularly in\nhigh dimension. The approach is based on combining the ideas of adaptive\nclustering and manifold learning. The manifold hypothesis means that high\ndimensional data can be well approximated by a d-dimensional manifold for small\nd helping to overcome the curse of dimensionality problem and to get sharp\nbounds on the cluster separation which only depend on the intrinsic dimension\nd.

However, traditional fault-injection attacks require physical\npresence, and hence, were often considered out of scope in many real-world\nadversary settings.\n  In this paper we show this assumption may no longer be justified. We present\nV0LTpwn, a novel hardware-oriented but software-controlled attack that affects\nthe integrity of computation in virtually any execution mode on modern x86\nprocessors. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first attack on\nx86 integrity from software. The key idea behind our attack is to undervolt a\nphysical core to force non-recoverable hardware faults.

In contrast to recently presented\nside-channel attacks that leverage vulnerable speculative execution, V0LTpwn is\nnot limited to information disclosure, but allows adversaries to affect\nexecution, and hence, effectively breaks the integrity goals of modern x86\nplatforms.

In dimension five or greater, we construct examples of antipodally\nsymmetric dynamically convex contact forms which are not strongly dynamically\nconvex, and thus not contactomorphic to convex ones via a contactomorphism\ncommuting with the antipodal map. Finally, we relax this condition on the\ncontactomorphism furnishing a condition that has non-empty $C^1$-interior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 18:45:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 20:14:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-09"}

As a formalizer, computing shapes how social problems are explicitly\ndefined --- changing how those problems, and possible responses to them, are\nunderstood. Computing serves as rebuttal when it illuminates the boundaries of\nwhat is possible through technical means. And computing acts as synecdoche when\nit makes long-standing social problems newly salient in the public eye.

Recent studies\nhave shown, however, that the standardized brightness of SN Ia is correlated\nwith host morphology, host mass, and local star formation rate (SFR),\nsuggesting a possible correlation with stellar population property. To\nunderstand the origin of these correlations, we have continued our\nspectroscopic observations to cover most of the reported nearby early-type host\ngalaxies.

As such, this is the most direct and stringent test ever made for the\nluminosity evolution of SN Ia.

Gamma\nrays are thought to result from the formation of collimated jets, but the\ndetails of this process continue to elude us. One fundamental observable is the\nemission profile of the jet as a function of viewing angle. We present two\nmethods to measure the effective angular width, $\\theta_B$, of short gamma-ray\nburst (sGRB) jets using gravitational wave and gamma-ray data, assuming all\nsGRBs have the same angular dependence for their luminosities. The first is a\ncounting experiment, where we combine the known detection thresholds of the\nLIGO/Virgo and Fermi Gamma Ray Burst Monitor detectors to infer parameters of\nsystems that are detected in gravitational waves. This method requires minimal\nknowledge about each event, beyond whether or not they were detected in\ngamma-rays. The second method uses additional information from the\ngravitational-wave and electromagnetic data to estimate parameters of the\nsource, and thereby improve constraints on jet properties. Applying our methods\nto GW170817, we find only weak constraints on the sGRB luminosity profile, with\nstatistical uncertainty dominating differences between models. We also analyze\nsimulated events from future observing runs, and find that with 5 and 100 BNS\ndetections, the counting method constrains the relative uncertainty in\n$\\theta_B$ to within 51% and 12%, respectively. Incorporating\ngravitational-wave parameter estimation would further tighten these constraints\nto 43% and 9.6%. In the limit of many detections, incorporating parameter\nestimation achieves only marginal improvements; we conclude that the majority\nof the information about jet structure comes from the relative sensitivities of\ngravitational-wave and gamma-ray detectors as encoded in simple counting\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-10"}

Using 9\nstate-of-the-art stellar evolution codes, we defined a set of input physics and\nphysical constants for our calculations and calibrated the convective\nefficiency to a specific point on the main sequence. We produced evolutionary\ntracks and stellar structure models at fixed radius along the red-giant branch\nfor masses of 1.0 M$_\\odot$, 1.5 M$_\\odot$, 2.0 M$_\\odot$, and 2.5 M$_\\odot$,\nand compared the predicted stellar properties.

The predicted ages show variations\nof 2-5% (increasing with stellar mass) which we track down to differences in\nthe numerical implementation of energy generation.

Therefore, when moment\nformation is weakened, such as in the single-band Hubbard model on a square\nlattice with the on-site repulsion being randomly switched off on a fraction\n$x$ of sites, magnetic order is suppressed beyond some critical $x_c$, which\nwas found to lie below the classical percolation threshold,\n$x_c^\\text{(perc,sq)}$. Here we study dilute magnetism in flat band systems,\nnamely in the Hubbard model on a `Lieb' lattice.

We track their evolution individually from the early,\npre-reionization era, through reionization, and beyond until $z=0$. Before\nreionization, low mass halos accrete cool cosmic web gas at a very rapid rate,\noften reaching the highest gas mass they will ever have. But when reionization\noccurs, we see that almost all halos lose significant quantities of their gas\ncontent, although some respond less quickly than others. We find that the\nresponse rate is influenced by halo mass first, and secondarily by their\ninternal gas density at the epoch of reionization. Reionization also fully\nionises the cosmic web gas by z$\\sim$6. As a result, the lowest mass halos\n(M$\\sim$10$^6~h^{-1}$M$_\\odot$ at $z=6$) can never again re-accrete gas from\nthe cosmic web, and by $z\\sim5$ have lost all their internal gas to ionisation,\nresulting in a halt in star formation at this epoch. However, more massive\nhalos can recover from their gas mass loss, and re-accrete ionised cosmic web\ngas. We find the efficiency of this re-accretion is a function of halo mass\nfirst, followed by local surrounding gas density. Halos that are closer to the\ncosmic web structure can accrete denser gas more rapidly. We find that our\nlower mass halos have a sweet spot for rapid, dense gas accretion at distances\nof roughly 1-5 virial radii from the most massive halos in our sample\n($>$10$^8~h^{-1}$M$_\\odot$), as these tend to be embedded deeply within the\ncosmic web.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 19:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

A giant\nimpact is believed to be responsible for the formation of Earth's Moon, but the\nspecific impact parameters are under debate. Because the canonical Moon-forming\nimpact is the most intensely studied scenario, it is often considered the\narchetypal giant impact. However, a wide range of impacts with different\noutcomes are possible. Here we examine the total energy budgets of giant\nimpacts that form Earth-mass bodies and find that they differ substantially\nacross the wide range of possible Moon-forming events. We show that\ngravitational potential energy exchange is important, and we determine the\nregime in which potential energy has a significant effect on the collision\noutcome. Energy is deposited heterogeneously within the colliding planets,\nincreasing their internal energies, and portions of each body attain sufficient\nentropy for vaporization. After gravitational re-equilibration, post-impact\nbodies are strongly thermally stratified, with varying amounts of vaporized and\nsupercritical mantle. The canonical Moon-forming impact is a relatively low\nenergy event and should not be considered the archetype of accretionary giant\nimpacts that form Earth-mass planets. After a giant impact, bodies are\nsignificantly inflated in size compared to condensed planets of the same mass,\nand there are substantial differences in the magnitudes of their potential,\nkinetic and internal energy components. As a result, the conditions for\nmetal-silicate equilibration and the subsequent evolution of the planet may\nvary widely between different impact scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 19:18:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

The fusion of Majorana modes at a junction between two nanowires results\nin a $4\\pi$-periodic Josephson effect. We elucidate how the $4\\pi$-periodicity\narises across the topological phase transition in a highly-transparent short\nnanowire junction. Owing to a high transmission coefficient, Majorana zero\nmodes coming from different wires are strongly coupled, with an energy scale\nset by the proximity-induced, field-independent pairing potential. At the same\ntime, the topological spectral gap---defined by competition between\nsuperconducting correlations and Zeeman splitting---becomes narrow in the\nvicinity of the transition point. The resulting hybridization of the fused\nMajorana states with the spectral continuum strongly affects the electron\ndensity of states at the junction and its Josephson energy. We study the\nmanifestations of this hybridization in the energy spectrum and phase\ndependence of the Josephson current.

Traditionally this process has largely been done\nby hand. This approach is not possible with today's large data volumes which\nrequire automated imaging pipelines. This paper describes an automated masking\nalgorithm that operates within CLEAN called AUTO-MULTITHRESH. This algorithm\nwas developed and validated using a set of ~1000 ALMA images chosen to span a\nrange of intrinsic morphology and data characteristics. It takes a top-down\napproach to producing masks: it uses the residual images to identify\nsignificant peaks and then expands the mask to include emission associated with\nthese peaks down to lower signal-to-noise noise. The AUTO-MULTITHRESH algorithm\nhas been implemented in CASA and has been used in production as part of the\nALMA Imaging Pipeline starting with Cycle 5. It has been shown to be able to\nmask a wide range of emission ranging from simple point sources to complex\nextended emission with minimal tuning of the parameters based on the point\nspread function of the data.

Although rsfMRI scans are typically collected\nwhile individuals are instructed to focus their eyes on a fixated cross,\nobjective and verified experimental measures to quantify degree of vigilance\nare not readily available. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the modality\nextensively used for estimating vigilance, especially during eyes-closed\nresting state. However, pupil size measured using an eye-tracker device could\nprovide an indirect index of vigilance. Methods: Three 12-min resting scans\n(eyes open, fixating on the cross) were collected from 10 healthy control\nparticipants. We simultaneously collected EEG, fMRI, physiological, and\neye-tracker data and investigated the correlation between EEG features, pupil\nsize, and heart rate. Furthermore, we used pupil size and EEG features as\nregressors to find their correlations with blood-oxygen-level-dependent fMRI\nmeasures. Results: EEG frontal and occipital beta power (FOBP) correlates with\npupil size changes, an indirect index for locus coeruleus activity implicated\nin vigilance regulation (r = 0.306, p < 0.001). Moreover, FOBP also correlated\nwith heart rate (r = 0.255, p < 0.001), as well as several brain regions in the\nanticorrelated network, including the bilateral insula and inferior parietal\nlobule. Discussion: In this study, we investigated whether simultaneous\nEEG-fMRI combined with eye-tracker measurements can be used to determine EEG\nsignal feature associated with vigilance measures during eyes-open rsfMRI. Our\nresults support the conclusion that FOBP is an objective measure of vigilance\nin healthy human subjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 20:52:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Jun 2021 03:45:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

One of the highlight goals of this\nprogramme is to prepare for the redshift drift measurement. Using the EAGLE\ncosmological hydrodynamic simulations, we estimate the peculiar acceleration of\ngas in galaxies and in the Lya forest. We find that star-forming 'cold neutral\ngas' exhibits large peculiar acceleration due to the high local density of\nbaryons near star-forming regions. We conclude that absorption by cold neutral\ngas is unlikely to yield a detection of the cosmological redshift drift. On the\nother hand, we find that the peculiar accelerations of Lya forest absorbers are\nmore than an order of magnitude below the expected cosmological signal. We also\nhighlight that the numerous low H I column density systems display lower\npeculiar acceleration.

For suitable combinations of absorption lines, the\ncosmological signal can be more than doubled, while the affect of the observer\npeculiar acceleration is mitigated.

Traditionally, estimation of the\ndistribution ratio requires on-policy data, which has caused previous work to\neither be exorbitantly data-inefficient or alter the original objective in a\nmanner that can drastically change its optimum. In this work, we show how the\noriginal distribution ratio estimation objective may be transformed in a\nprincipled manner to yield a completely off-policy objective. In addition to\nthe data-efficiency that this provides, we are able to show that this objective\nalso renders the use of a separate RL optimization unnecessary.Rather, an\nimitation policy may be learned directly from this objective without the use of\nexplicit rewards. We call the resulting algorithm ValueDICE and evaluate it on\na suite of popular imitation learning benchmarks, finding that it can achieve\nstate-of-the-art sample efficiency and performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 22:31:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-12"}

OPF\nproblems that use the nonlinear AC power flow equations to accurately model the\nnetwork physics have inherent challenges associated with non-convexity. To\naddress these challenges, recent research has applied various convex relaxation\napproaches to OPF problems. The QC relaxation is a promising approach that\nconvexifies the trigonometric and product terms in the OPF problem by enclosing\nthese terms in convex envelopes. The accuracy of the QC relaxation strongly\ndepends on the tightness of these envelopes. This paper presents two\nimprovements to these envelopes. The first improvement leverages a polar\nrepresentation of the branch admittances in addition to the rectangular\nrepresentation used previously. The second improvement is based on a coordinate\ntransformation via a complex per unit base power normalization that rotates the\npower flow equations. The trigonometric envelopes resulting from this rotation\ncan be tighter than the corresponding envelopes in previous QC relaxation\nformulations.

Cancer heterogeneity is observed at multiple biological levels.\nTo improve our understanding of these differences and their relevance in\nmedicine, approaches to link organ- and tissue-level information from\ndiagnostic images and cellular-level information from genomics are needed.\nHowever, these \"radiogenomic\" studies often use linear, shallow models, depend\non feature selection, or consider one gene at a time to map images to genes.\nMoreover, no study has systematically attempted to understand the molecular\nbasis of imaging traits based on the interpretation of what the neural network\nhas learned. These current studies are thus limited in their ability to\nunderstand the transcriptomic drivers of imaging traits, which could provide\nadditional context for determining clinical traits, such as prognosis.\n  Results. We present an approach based on neural networks that takes\nhigh-dimensional gene expressions as input and performs nonlinear mapping to an\nimaging trait. To interpret the models, we propose gene masking and gene\nsaliency to extract learned relationships from radiogenomic neural networks. In\nglioblastoma patients, our models outperform comparable classifiers (>0.10 AUC)\nand our interpretation methods were validated using a similar model to identify\nknown relationships between genes and molecular subtypes. We found that imaging\ntraits had specific transcription patterns, e.g., edema and genes related to\ncellular invasion, and 15 radiogenomic associations were predictive of\nsurvival. We demonstrate that neural networks can model transcriptomic\nheterogeneity to reflect differences in imaging and can be used to derive\nradiogenomic associations with clinical value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 01:11:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

Given two arbitrary tensor-product quantum states (TPQS)\n$\\rho_{\\pm} = \\rho_{\\pm}^{(1)} \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes \\rho_{\\pm}^{(N)}$,\ndetermining the joint $N$-system measurement to optimally distinguish between\nthe two states is a hard problem. Thus, there is great interest in identifying\nlocal measurement schemes that are optimal or close-to-optimal. In this work,\nwe focus on distinguishing between two general TPQS. We begin by generalizing\nprevious work by Acin et al. (Phys. Rev. A 71, 032338) to show that a locally\ngreedy (LG) scheme using Bayesian updating can optimally distinguish between\ntwo states that can be written as tensor products of arbitrary pure states.\nThen, we show that even in the limit of large $N$ the same algorithm cannot\ndistinguish tensor products of mixed states with vanishing error probability.\nThis poor asymptotic behavior occurs because the Helstrom measurement becomes\ntrivial for sufficiently biased priors. Based on this, we introduce a modified\nlocally greedy (MLG) scheme with strictly better performance.\n  In the second part of this work, we compare these simple local schemes with a\ngeneral dynamic programming (DP) approach that finds the optimal series of\nlocal measurements to distinguish the two states. When the subsystems are\nnon-identical, we demonstrate that the ordering of the systems affects\nperformance and we extend the DP technique to determine the optimal ordering\nadaptively. Finally, in contrast to the binary optimal collective measurement,\nwe show that adaptive protocols on sufficiently large (e.g., qutrit) subsystems\nmust contain non-binary measurements to be optimal.

With the exception of a few footnotes, this paper\nassumes only a high school mathematical and scientific background, so that it\nmay be accessible to academics in all fields, decision-makers in industry,\ngovernment, and philanthropy, and anyone who is interested in systems and\nsociety.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 02:36:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 05:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

In this paper, we derive the\nupper and lower bounds of the gradient of solutions to the conductivity problem\nwhere two perfectly conducting inclusions are located very close to each other.\nTo be specific, we extend the known results of Bao-Li-Yin (ARMA 2009) in two\nfolds: First, we weaken the smoothness of the inclusions from C^{2,\\alpha} to\nC^{1,\\alpha}. To obtain an pointwise upper bound of the gradient, we follow an\niteration technique developed by Bao-Li-Li (ARMA 2015), who mainly deal with\nthe system of linear elasticity. However, when the inclusions are of C^{1,\n\\alpha}, we can not use W^{2,p} estimates for elliptic equations any more. In\norder to overcome this new difficulty, we take advantage of De Giorgi-Nash\nestimates and Campanato's approach to apply an adapted version of the iteration\ntechnique with respect to the energy. A lower bound in the shortest line\nbetween two inclusions is also obtained to show the optimality of the blow-up\nrate. Second, when two inclusions are only convex but not strictly convex, we\nprove that blow-up does not occur any more. Moreover, the establishment of the\nrelationship between the blow-up rate of the gradient and the order of the\nconvexity of the inclusions reveals the mechanism of such concentration\nphenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 03:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-12"}

However, the difficulty of estimating the normalized\ndiscounted weighting of states, or the stationary state distribution, is quite\nwell-known. Additionally, the large sample complexity of policy gradient\nmethods is often attributed to insufficient exploration, and to remedy this, it\nis often assumed that the restart distribution provides sufficient exploration\nin these algorithms. In this work, we propose exploration in policy gradient\nmethods based on maximizing entropy of the discounted future state\ndistribution. The key contribution of our work includes providing a practically\nfeasible algorithm to estimate the normalized discounted weighting of states,\ni.e, the \\textit{discounted future state distribution}. We propose that\nexploration can be achieved by entropy regularization with the discounted state\ndistribution in policy gradients, where a metric for maximal coverage of the\nstate space can be based on the entropy of the induced state distribution. The\nproposed approach can be considered as a three time-scale algorithm and under\nsome mild technical conditions, we prove its convergence to a locally optimal\npolicy.

However, because of the\ndifficulty involved in obtaining accurate annotations due to the extremely low\nvisibility and commonly occurring occlusions of the puck, the problem is very\nchallenging. The problem becomes even more challenging in broadcast videos with\nchanging camera angles. We introduce a novel methodology for determining puck\nlocation from approximate puck location annotations in broadcast video. Our\nmethod uniquely leverages the existing puck location information that is\npublicly available in existing hockey event data and uses the corresponding\none-second broadcast video clips as input to the network. The rationale behind\nusing video as input instead of static images is that with video, the temporal\ninformation can be utilized to handle puck occlusions. The network outputs a\nheatmap representing the probability of the puck location using a 3D CNN based\narchitecture. The network is able to regress the puck location from broadcast\nhockey video clips with varying camera angles. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe capability of the method, achieving 47.07% AUC on the test dataset. The\nnetwork is also able to estimate the puck location in defensive/offensive zones\nwith an accuracy of greater than 80%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 03:52:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 20:01:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 03:42:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-19"}

Finding a\nuniversal scaling law of turbulence statistics of TBLs over a wide range of\nadverse pressure gradients (APG) remains unresolved.

The\ncharacteristic length scale, which is termed the `shear thickness',\n$\\delta^\\ast$, is defined as the location which corresponds to the end of an\nactively sheared region in a turbulent shear flow, where the nondimensional\nshear rate normalised by the kinetic energy and the dissipation rate is\napproximately constant. Next, we show a universal scaling using a mixed\nvelocity, termed the `friction-pressure velocity', $u^\\ast$, which is based on\ntotal shear stress. It is revealed that the velocity fluctuations and the\nReynolds stresses in TBLs over a wide range of APGs agree well with those in\nTBLs with zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG). The present scaling is used to scale\nthe kinetic energy balance in TBLs, and compare them to other shear flows.\nFurthermore, a scaling for small-scale properties, i.e. vorticities, using\n$\\delta^\\ast$ and $u^\\ast$ is also obtained assuming the local equilibrium in\nthe inertial range. The present scaling for wall-bounded shear flows, including\nTBLs over a wide range of pressure gradients, implies that the underlying\ninstantaneous turbulence structures have common features under a proper scaling\nand is key to the development and application of turbulent models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 07:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-12"}

We observe two crucial phenomena: 1) the detection accuracy of the\nhard objects, e.g., Pedestrians, is unsatisfactory, 2) when adding additional\nnoise points, the performance of existing approaches decreases rapidly. To\nalleviate these problems, a novel TANet is introduced in this paper, which\nmainly contains a Triple Attention (TA) module, and a Coarse-to-Fine Regression\n(CFR) module. By considering the channel-wise, point-wise and voxel-wise\nattention jointly, the TA module enhances the crucial information of the target\nwhile suppresses the unstable cloud points. Besides, the novel stacked TA\nfurther exploits the multi-level feature attention. In addition, the CFR module\nboosts the accuracy of localization without excessive computation cost.\nExperimental results on the validation set of KITTI dataset demonstrate that,\nin the challenging noisy cases, i.e., adding additional random noisy points\naround each object,the presented approach goes far beyond state-of-the-art\napproaches. Furthermore, for the 3D object detection task of the KITTI\nbenchmark, our approach ranks the first place on Pedestrian class, by using the\npoint clouds as the only input. The running speed is around 29 frames per\nsecond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 08:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-12"}

However, these systems require an excessive amount of\nlabeled data to be adequately trained. Gathering a correctly annotated dataset\nis not always feasible due to several factors, such as the expensiveness of the\nlabeling process or difficulty of correctly classifying data, even for the\nexperts. Because of these practical challenges, label noise is a common problem\nin real-world datasets, and numerous methods to train deep neural networks with\nlabel noise are proposed in the literature. Although deep neural networks are\nknown to be relatively robust to label noise, their tendency to overfit data\nmakes them vulnerable to memorizing even random noise. Therefore, it is crucial\nto consider the existence of label noise and develop counter algorithms to fade\naway its adverse effects to train deep neural networks efficiently. Even though\nan extensive survey of machine learning techniques under label noise exists,\nthe literature lacks a comprehensive survey of methodologies centered\nexplicitly around deep learning in the presence of noisy labels. This paper\naims to present these algorithms while categorizing them into one of the two\nsubgroups: noise model based and noise model free methods. Algorithms in the\nfirst group aim to estimate the noise structure and use this information to\navoid the adverse effects of noisy labels.

Although the new generation of radial-velocity (RV) instruments such\nas ESPRESSO are expected to reach the long-term precision required to find\nother earths, the RV measurements are contaminated by some signal from stellar\nactivity. This makes these detections hard. Aims. On real observations, we here\ndemonstrate for the first time the effect of stellar activity on the RV of\nindividual spectral lines. Recent studies have shown that this is probably the\nkey for mitigating this perturbing signal. Results. We estimate that at least\n89% of the lines that appear in the spectrum of alpha Cen B for which we\nmeasure a reliable RV are correlated with the stellar activity signal. This can\nbe interpreted as those lines being sensitive to the inhibition of the\nconvective blueshift observed in active regions. Because the velocity of the\nconvective blueshift increases with physical depth inside the stellar\natmosphere, we find that the effect induced by stellar activity on the RV of\nindividual spectral lines is inversely proportional to the line depth. The\nstellar activity signal can be mitigated down to 0.8-0.9 m/s, either by\nselecting lines that are less sensitive to activity or by using the difference\nbetween the RV of the spectral lines that are formed at different depths in the\nstellar atmosphere as an activity proxy. Conclusions. This paper shows for the\nfirst time that based on real observations of solar-type stars, it is possible\nto measure the RV effect of stellar activity on the RV of individual spectral\nlines.

It provides a powerful probe of the\nstrong field regime of General Relativity, and opens fruitful avenues for the\nexploration of new gravitational physics. The latter can be captured via\nmodified theories of gravity, which modify the Einstein-Hilbert action of\nGeneral Relativity and/or some of its principles. These theories typically\nchange the stellar structure equations, thus having a large impact on the\nastrophysical properties of the corresponding stars and opening a new window to\nconstrain these theories with present and future observations. For relativistic\n(neutron) stars, the uncertainty on the equation of state of matter at\nsupranuclear densities intertwines with the new parameters of the modified\ngravity side, providing new phenomenology for the predictions of stellar\nstructure models, such as mass-radius relations, maximum masses, or moment of\ninertia. For non-relativistic stars (white, brown and red dwarfs), the\nweakening/strengthening of the gravitational force inside astrophysical bodies\nmay induce changes on the star's mass, radius or luminosity, having an impact,\nfor instance, in the Chandrasekhar's limit for white dwarfs, or in the minimum\nmass for stable hydrogen burning in brown dwarfs. This work aims to provide a\nbroad overview of the main such results achieved in the recent literature, by\ncombining the results and constraints obtained from the analysis of\nrelativistic and non-relativistic stars in different scenarios. Moreover, we\nwill build a bridge between the efforts of the community working on different\ntheories, formulations, types of stars, theoretical modellings, and\nobservational aspects, highlighting some of the most promising opportunities in\nthe field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 09:41:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 12:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

We simulated\na series of hyperbolic encounters between proto-Mercury and proto-Venus, which\nmay occur in the chaotic early solar system. Tidal disruption of proto-Mercury\nalways removes part of its silicate mantle while its iron core remains intact.\nWe find, in favourable cases, four close encounters with fast spinning\nprojectiles (resulting from previous encounters) can lead to present-day\nMercury iron fraction. More encounters are needed when the spin and orbital\nangular momentum are not always aligned.

The\nsystem of the shallow water equations is enriched, using the width as a\nspace-dependent variable, together with the depth and the unit discharge, which\nconversely depend on both space and time. Such a formulation allows a\nquasi-analytical treatment of the system, whose solution is similar to that of\nthe classic Stoker solution when the downstream/upstream depth ratio is\nsufficiently large, except that a further stationary contact wave exists at the\ndam position. When the downstream/upstream depth ratio is small, the solution\nis richer than the Stoker solution because the critical state occurs at the dam\nposition and the solution itself becomes resonant at the same position, where\ntwo eigenvalues are null and the strict hyperbolicity of the system is lost.\nThe limits that identify the flow regime for channel contraction and channel\nexpansion are discussed after showing that the nondimensional parameters\ngoverning the problem are the downstream/upstream width ratio and the\ndownstream/upstream initial depth ratio.

The size of all three CNN specifications is the same,\nabout 150 lines of code. Our mini framework is 150 lines of highly reusable\nhardware-agnostic code that does not depend on external libraries. The compiler\nfor a host array language automatically generates parallel code for a chosen\narchitecture. The key to such a balance between performance and portability\nlies in the design of the array language; in particular, the ability to express\nrank-polymorphic operations concisely, yet being able to do optimisations\nacross them. This design builds on very few assumptions, and it is readily\ntransferable to other contexts offering a clean approach to high-performance\nmachine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 11:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

We investigate the effect of such an isothermal regime on the\ninteraction (where both the shock and filament are isothermal), and we examine\nhow the nature of the interaction changes when the orientation of the filament,\nthe shock Mach number, and the filament density contrast are varied. We find\nthat only sideways-oriented filaments with a density contrast of $10^2$ form a\nthree-rolled structure, dissimilar to the results of a previous study.\nMoreover, the angle of orientation of the filament plays a large role in the\nevolution of the filament morphology: the greater the angle of orientation, the\nlonger and less turbulent the wake. Turbulent stripping of filament material\nleading to fragmentation of the core occurs in most filaments; however,\nfilaments orientated at an angle of $85^{\\circ}$ to the shock front do not\nfragment and are longer-lived. In addition, values of the drag time are\ninfluenced by the filament length, with longer filaments being accelerated\nfaster than shorter ones. Furthermore, filaments in an isothermal regime\nexhibit faster acceleration than those struck by an adiabatic shock. Finally,\nwe find that the drag and mixing times of the filament increase as the angle of\norientation of the filament is increased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 11:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

The final goal is to identify the best combination of the\nthree accelerating factors for which i) the bed responds linearly to\nhydrodynamic changes; ii) a consistent decrease of the computational cost is\nobtained. The sought combination is obtained by studying the behaviour of an\napproximate solution of the three eigenvalues associated with the flux matrix\nof the accelerated system.

Spectrum characterization involves the identification of vacant bands\nalong with center frequency and parameters (energy, modulation, etc.) of\noccupied bands. Such characterization at Nyquist sampling is area and\npower-hungry due to the need for high-speed digitization. Though sub-Nyquist\nsampling (SNS) offers an excellent alternative when the spectrum is sparse, it\nsuffers from poor performance at low signal to noise ratio (SNR) and demands\ncareful design and integration of digital reconstruction, tunable channelizer\nand characterization algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel\ndeep-learning framework via a single unified pipeline to accomplish two tasks:\n1)~Reconstruct the signal directly from sub-Nyquist samples, and 2)~Wideband\nspectrum characterization.

An essential criterion for FS image quality control is that all the\nessential anatomical structures in the section should appear full and\nremarkable with a clear boundary. Therefore, our scheme aims to identify those\nessential anatomical structures to judge whether an FS image is the standard\nimage, which is achieved by three convolutional neural networks. The Feature\nExtraction Network aims to extract deep level features of FS images. Based on\nthe extracted features, the Class Prediction Network determines whether the\nstructure meets the standard and Region Proposal Network identifies its\nposition. The scheme has been applied to three types of fetal sections, which\nare the head, abdominal, and heart.

Previous works\nare restricted in modulating image with a single coefficient. However, real\nimages always contain multiple types of degradation, which cannot be well\ndetermined by one coefficient. To make a step forward, this paper presents a\nnew problem setup, called multi-dimension (MD) modulation, which aims at\nmodulating output effects across multiple degradation types and levels.\nCompared with the previous single-dimension (SD) modulation, the MD is setup to\nhandle multiple degradations adaptively and relief unbalanced learning problem\nin different degradations. We also propose a deep architecture - CResMD with\nnewly introduced controllable residual connections for multi-dimension\nmodulation. Specifically, we add a controlling variable on the conventional\nresidual connection to allow a weighted summation of input and residual. The\nvalues of these weights are generated by another condition network. We further\npropose a new data sampling strategy based on beta distribution to balance\ndifferent degradation types and levels. With corrupted image and degradation\ninformation as inputs, the network can output the corresponding restored image.\nBy tweaking the condition vector, users can control the output effects in MD\nspace at test time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CResMD\nachieve excellent performance on both SD and MD modulation tasks.

One plausible explanation is that\na wave is present in the bursting ocean, the rotating frame frequency of which\nis the offset. The frequency of the wave should decrease (in the rotating\nframe) as the burst cools hence explaining the drift. A strong candidate is a\nbuoyant $r$-mode. To date, models that calculated the frequency of this mode\ntaking into account the radial structure neglected relativistic effects and\npredicted rotating frame frequencies of $\\sim$ 4 Hz and frequency drifts of > 5\nHz; too large to be consistent with observations. We present a calculation that\nincludes frame-dragging and gravitational redshift that reduces the rotating\nframe frequency by up to 30 % and frequency drift by up to 20 %. Updating\nprevious models for the ocean cooling in the aftermath of the burst to a model\nmore representative of detailed calculations of thermonuclear X-ray bursts\nreduces the frequency of the mode still further.

The incompressible\nfluid is modeled with an artificial compressibility approach in order to avoid\nsolving elliptical problems. No-slip and in/outflow boundary conditions are\nimposed using volume penalization. The governing equations are discretized on a\nlocally uniform Cartesian grid with centered finite differences, and integrated\nin time with a Runge--Kutta scheme, both of 4th order. The domain is\npartitioned into cubic blocks with equidistant grids with different resolution\nand, for each block, biorthogonal interpolating wavelets are used as refinement\nindicators and prediction operators. Thresholding the wavelet coefficients\nallows to generate dynamically evolving grids, and an adaption strategy tracks\nthe solution in both space and scale. Blocks are distributed among MPI\nprocesses and the global topology of the grid is encoded using a tree-like data\nstructure.

Among them, FPN is one of the\nrepresentative works that build a feature pyramid by multi-scale features\nsummation. However, the design defects behind prevent the multi-scale features\nfrom being fully exploited. In this paper, we begin by first analyzing the\ndesign defects of feature pyramid in FPN, and then introduce a new feature\npyramid architecture named AugFPN to address these problems. Specifically,\nAugFPN consists of three components: Consistent Supervision, Residual Feature\nAugmentation, and Soft RoI Selection. AugFPN narrows the semantic gaps between\nfeatures of different scales before feature fusion through Consistent\nSupervision. In feature fusion, ratio-invariant context information is\nextracted by Residual Feature Augmentation to reduce the information loss of\nfeature map at the highest pyramid level. Finally, Soft RoI Selection is\nemployed to learn a better RoI feature adaptively after feature fusion. By\nreplacing FPN with AugFPN in Faster R-CNN, our models achieve 2.3 and 1.6\npoints higher Average Precision (AP) when using ResNet50 and MobileNet-v2 as\nbackbone respectively. Furthermore, AugFPN improves RetinaNet by 1.6 points AP\nand FCOS by 0.9 points AP when using ResNet50 as backbone.

It has been\ndeveloped as a tool to solve (typically graph) problems in systems where the\ninput is distributed over many machines with limited space. Recent work has\nfocused on the regime in which machines have sublinear (in $n$, the number of\nnodes in the input graph) memory, with randomized algorithms presented for\nfundamental graph problems of Maximal Matching and Maximal Independent Set.\nHowever, there have been no prior corresponding \\emph{deterministic}\nalgorithms.\n  A major challenge underlying the sublinear space setting is that the local\nspace of each machine might be too small to store all the edges incident to a\nsingle node. This poses a considerable obstacle compared to the classical\nmodels in which each node is assumed to know and have easy access to its\nincident edges. To overcome this barrier we introduce a new \\emph{graph\nsparsification technique} that \\emph{deterministically} computes a low-degree\nsubgraph with additional desired properties.

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel self-supervised method that leverages multiple imaging modalities. We\nintroduce the multimodal puzzle task, which facilitates rich representation\nlearning from multiple image modalities. The learned representations allow for\nsubsequent fine-tuning on different downstream tasks. To achieve that, we learn\na modality-agnostic feature embedding by confusing image modalities at the\ndata-level. Together with the Sinkhorn operator, with which we formulate the\npuzzle solving optimization as permutation matrix inference instead of\nclassification, they allow for efficient solving of multimodal puzzles with\nvarying levels of complexity. In addition, we also propose to utilize\ncross-modal generation techniques for multimodal data augmentation used for\ntraining self-supervised tasks. In other words, we exploit synthetic images for\nself-supervised pretraining, instead of downstream tasks directly, in order to\ncircumvent quality issues associated with synthetic images, while improving\ndata-efficiency and representations quality. Our experimental results, which\nassess the gains in downstream performance and data-efficiency, show that\nsolving our multimodal puzzles yields better semantic representations, compared\nto treating each modality independently.

We consider API calls of\nPE files as their distinguishing features where the feature vector is a binary\nvector representing the presence-absence of API calls. In our method, we first\ncreate a dataset of benign samples by querying the target classifier. We next\nconstruct a code table of frequent patterns for the compression of this dataset\nusing the MDL principle. We finally generate an adversarial example\ncorresponding to a malware sample by selecting and adding a pattern from the\nbenign code table to the malware sample. The selected pattern is the one that\nminimizes the length of the compressed adversarial example given the code\ntable. This modification preserves the functionalities of the original malware\nsample as all original API calls are kept, and only some new API calls are\nadded. Considering a neural network, we show that the evasion rate is 78.24\npercent for adversarial examples compared to 8.16 percent for original malware\nsamples.

This principle constrains physical theories\nto allow for our existence, yet the principle does not apply to the existence\nof technology. Cosmological natural selection has been proposed as an\nalternative to anthropic reasoning. Within this framework, fine-tuning results\nfrom selection of universes capable of prolific reproduction.

The idea of dictionary learning\nis well known; it is a synthesis formulation where a basis is learnt along with\nthe coefficients so as to generate or synthesize the data.

The concept of kernel dictionary learning has been\nintroduced in the recent past, where the dictionary is represented as a linear\ncombination of non-linear version of the data. Its success has been showcased\nin feature extraction. In this work we propose to kernelize transform learning\non line similar to kernel dictionary learning. An efficient solution for kernel\ntransform learning has been proposed especially for problems where the number\nof samples is much larger than the dimensionality of the input samples making\nthe kernel matrix very high dimensional. Kernel transform learning has been\ncompared with other representation learning tools like autoencoder, restricted\nBoltzmann machine as well as with dictionary learning (and its kernelized\nversion).

The\nlatest of the expectations, automation of the dynamic driving task however, is\npoised to bring about some of the largest changes seen so far. In one fell\nswoop, not only does required functionality for automated driving drastically\nincrease the system complexity, it also removes the fall-back of the human\ndriver who is usually relied upon to handle unanticipated failures after the\nfact. The need to architect thus requires a greater rigour than ever before, to\nmaintain the level of safety that has been associated with the automotive\nindustry. The work that is part of this thesis has been conducted, in close\ncollaboration with our industrial partner Scania CV AB, within the Vinnova FFI\nfunded project ARCHER. This thesis aims to provide a methodology for\narchitecting during the concept phase of development, using industrial\npractices and principles including those from safety standards such as ISO\n26262. The main contributions of the thesis are in two areas. The first area\ni.e. Part A contributes, (i) an analysis of the challenges of architecting\nautomated driving, and serves as a motivation for the approach taken in the\nrest of this thesis, i.e. Part B where the contributions include, (ii) a\ndefinition of a viewpoint for functional safety according to the definitions of\nISO 42010, (iii) a method to systematically extract information from legacy\ncomponents and (iv) a process to use legacy information and architect in the\npresence of uncertainty to provide a work product, the Preliminary\nArchitectural Assumptions (PAA), as required by ISO 26262. The contributions of\nPart B together comprise a methodology to architect the PAA. <read full\nabstract in pdf>\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 17:53:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-09"}

This paper utilized text mining to\ndisclose hidden topics and explore their weight across three variables:\nharasser gender, institution type, and victim's field of study.

Fourteen percent of the topics were in the gender harassment theme, in\nwhich insulting, sexist, or degrading comments or behavior was directed towards\nwomen. Five percent of the topics involved sexual coercion (a benefit is\noffered in exchange for sexual favors), 5% involved sex discrimination, and 7%\nof the topics discussed retaliation against the victim for reporting the\nharassment, or for simply not complying with the harasser.
