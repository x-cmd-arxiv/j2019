The basic approach applies broadly in\nthat (unlike most of the literature) it works for a wide range of auction\nformats and allows for asymmetric bidders. Though our approach is not\nrestrictive, we focus our analysis on first--price, sealed--bid auctions with\nindependent private valuations. We highlight two nonparametric estimation\nstrategies, one based on a least squares criterion and the other on a maximum\nlikelihood criterion. We also provide the first direct estimator of the\nstrategy function. We establish several theoretical properties of our methods\nto guide empirical analysis and inference. In addition to providing the\nasymptotic distributions of our estimators, we identify ways in which\nmethodological choices should be tailored to the objects of their interest. For\nobjects like the bidders' ex ante surplus and the seller's counterfactual\nexpected revenue with an additional symmetric bidder, we show that our\ninput--parameter--free estimators achieve the semiparametric efficiency bound.\nFor objects like the bidders' inverse strategy function, we provide an easily\nimplementable boundary--corrected kernel smoothing and transformation method in\norder to ensure the squared error is integrable over the entire support of the\nvaluations. An extensive simulation study illustrates our analytical results\nand demonstrates the respective advantages of our least--squares and maximum\nlikelihood estimators in finite samples. Compared to estimation strategies\nbased on kernel density estimation, the simulations indicate that the smoothed\nversions of our estimators enjoy a large degree of robustness to the choice of\nan input parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 16:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

The latter are characterized by\ndifferent numbers of mergers, mergers mass ratios and gas fractions, and\ntiming. Depending on the sequence and nature of these mergers that follow the\nfirst phase of the in-situ star formation, these accretion histories may lead\nto ETGs that have low or high mass halos, and that rotate fast or slow. Since\nthe stellar halos maintain the fossil records of the events that led to their\nformation, a discontinuity may be in place between the inner regions of ETGs\nand their outer halos, because the time required for the halos stars to\nexchange their energies and momenta is very long compared with the age of these\nsystems. Exquisite deep photometry and extended spectroscopy for significant\nsamples of ETGs are then used to quantify the occurrence and significance of\nsuch a transition in the galaxies structural and kinematical parameters. Once\nthis transition radius is measured, its dependency with the effective radius of\nthe galaxies light distribution and total stellar masses can be investigated.\nSuch correlations can then be compared with the predictions of accreted, i.e.\nex-situ vs. in-situ components from cosmological simulations to validate such\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 17:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

However, many statistical\nlearning models applied to language impose a sampling scale while extracting\nstatistical structure. For instance, Word2Vec constructs a vector embedding\nthat maximizes the prediction between a target word and the context words that\nappear nearby in the corpus. The size of the context is chosen by the user and\ndefines a strong scale; relationships over much larger temporal scales would be\ninvisible to the algorithm. This paper examines the family of Word2Vec\nembeddings generated while systematically manipulating the sampling scale used\nto define the context around each word. The primary result is that different\nlinguistic relationships are preferentially encoded at different scales.\nDifferent scales emphasize different syntactic and semantic relations between\nwords.Moreover, the neighborhoods of a given word in the embeddings change\nsignificantly depending on the scale. These results suggest that any individual\nscale can only identify a subset of the meaningful relationships a word might\nhave, and point toward the importance of developing scale-free models of\nsemantic meaning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 17:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

The underlying techniques work also\nfor tracing space curve in higher-dimensional space. Since the topology of a\ncurve near a singular point of it is not numerically stable, we trace only the\ncurve outside neighborhoods of singular points and replace each neighborhood\nsimply by a point, which produces a polygonal approximation that is\n$\\epsilon$-close to the curve. Such an approximation is more stable for\ndefining the numerical connectedness of the complement of the projection of the\ncurve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which is important for applications such as solving\nbi-parametric polynomial systems. The algorithm starts by computing three types\nof key points of the curve, namely the intersection of the curve with small\nspheres centered at singular points, regular critical points of every connected\ncomponents of the curve, as well as intersection points of the curve with the\ngiven bounding box.

Replacing communication channels by maximally\nentangled states is a promising idea for the quantum-secured Internet (QI).\nWhile it is an important idea for large distances secure communication, for the\ncase of the mentioned class of servers pure entanglement based solution is not\nonly unnecessary but also opens a threat.

They transform the evolution operator into a form\nimplementable on a quantum device, while incurring an error---the Trotter\nerror. The Trotter error can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the\nTrotter number. However, this increases the length of the quantum circuits\nrequired, which may be impractical. It is therefore desirable to find methods\nof reducing the Trotter error through alternate means. The Trotter error is\ndependent on the order in which individual term unitaries are applied. Due to\nthe factorial growth in the number of possible orderings with respect to the\nnumber of terms, finding an optimal strategy for ordering Trotter sequences is\ndifficult. In this paper, we propose three ordering strategies, and assess\ntheir impact on the Trotter error incurred. Initially, we exhaustively examine\nthe possible orderings for molecular hydrogen in a STO-3G basis. We demonstrate\nhow the optimal ordering scheme depends on the compatibility graph of the\nHamiltonian, and show how it varies with increasing bond length. We then use 44\nmolecular Hamiltonians to evaluate two strategies based on coloring their\nincompatibility graphs, while considering the properties of the obtained\ncolorings. We find that the Trotter error for most systems involving heavy\natoms, using a reference magnitude ordering, is less than 1 kcal/mol. Relative\nto this, the difference between ordering schemes can be substantial, being\napproximately on the order of millihartrees. The coloring-based ordering\nschemes are reasonably promising, however further work is required. Finally, we\nconsider ordering strategies based on the norm of the Trotter error operator,\nincluding an iterative method for generating the new error operator terms added\nupon insertion of a term into an ordered Hamiltonian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 18:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

This is a well-known\nmechanism in developing flexible distributions, by embedding the cumulative\ndistribution function (cdf) of a baseline distribution within the beta\ndistribution that acts as a generator. Univariate beta-generated distributions\noffer many fruitful and tractable properties and have applications in\nhydrology, biology and environmental sciences amongst other fields. In the\nunivariate cases, this extension works well, however, for multivariate cases,\nthe beta distribution generator delivers complex expressions. In this document,\nthe proposed extension from the univariate to the multivariate domain addresses\nthe need of flexible multivariate distributions that can model a wide range of\nmultivariate data. This new family of multivariate distributions, whose\nmarginals are beta-generated distributed, is constructed with the function\nH(x_{1},...,x_{p})=F(G_{1}(x_{1}),G_{2}(x_{2}),...,G_{p}(x_{p})), where\n$G_{i}(x_{i})$ are the cdfs of the gamma (baseline) distribution and F(.) as\nthe cdf of the Dirichlet distribution.

The proposed Dirichlet-generated distributions\ncan be applied to compositional data. The parameters of the model are estimated\nby using the maximum likelihood method. The effectiveness and prominence of the\nproposed family are illustrated by analyzing simulated as well as two real\ndatasets.

Here we probe a key prediction of\nquantum criticality, namely power law dependence of the associated nematic\nsusceptibility as a function of composition and temperature approaching the\ncompositionally-tuned putative quantum critical point. To probe the 'bare'\nquantum critical point requires suppression of the superconducting state, which\nwe achieve by using large magnetic fields, up to 45 T, while performing\nelastoresistivity measurements to follow the nematic susceptibility. We\nperformed these measurements for the prototypical electron-doped pnictide,\nBa(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$, over a dense comb of dopings. We find that\nclose to the putative quantum critical point, the nematic susceptibility\nappears to obey power law behavior over almost a decade of variation in\ncomposition, consistent with basic notions of nematic quantum criticality.\nParadoxically, however, we also find that the temperature dependence for\ncompositions close to the critical value cannot be described by a single power\nlaw. This is surprising as power law scaling in both doping and temperature is\nexpected close to a quantum critical point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 18:40:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 03:04:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-24"}

The most striking among these is the Mass\nDiscrepancy-Acceleration Relation (MDAR), which encodes both a tight baryonic\nTully-Fisher relation (BTFR) and the observed diversity of galaxy rotation\ncurves through the central surface density relation (CSDR). Building on our\nearlier work, we propose here that the MDAR is the result of interactions\nbetween baryons and 'Baryon-Interacting Dark Matter' (BIDM), which heat up the\ndark matter. Following a bottom-up, hydrodynamical approach, we find that the\nMDAR follows if: $i)$ the BIDM equation of state approximates that of an ideal\ngas; $ii)$ the BIDM relaxation time is order the Jeans time; $iii)$ the heating\nrate is inversely proportional to the BIDM density. Remarkably, under these\nassumptions the set of hydrodynamical equations together with Poisson's\nequation enjoy an anisotropic scaling symmetry. In the BIDM-dominated regime,\nthis gives rise to an enhanced symmetry which fully captures the\nlow-acceleration limit of the MDAR. We then show that, assuming a cored\npseudo-isothermal profile at equilibrium, this set of equations gives rise to\nparameters reproducing the MDAR. Specifically, in the flat part of the rotation\ncurve the asymptotic rotational velocity matches the parametric dependence of\nthe BTFR. Moreover, in the central region of high-surface brightness galaxies,\nthe profile reproduces the CSDR. Finally, by studying the time-dependent\napproach to equilibrium, we derive a global combination of the BTFR and CSDR,\nwhich matches the expectations in low surface-brightness galaxies. The form of\nthe heating rate also makes model-independent predictions for various\ncosmological observables. We argue that our scenario satisfies existing\nobservational constraints, and, intriguingly, offers a possible explanation to\nthe EDGES anomaly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 19:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 20:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

Recent methods have shown how to efficiently estimate\nHamiltonians in principle, but they are poorly conditioned and can only\ncharacterize the system up to a scalar factor, making them difficult to use in\npractice. In this work we present a Bayesian methodology, called Bayesian\nHamiltonian Learning (BHL), that addresses both of these issues by making use\nof any or all, of the following: well-characterised experimental control of\nHamiltonian couplings, the preparation of multiple states, and the availability\nof any prior information for the Hamiltonian. Importantly, BHL can be used\nonline as an adaptive measurement protocol, updating estimates and their\ncorresponding uncertainties as experimental data become available. In addition,\nwe show that multiple input states and control fields enable BHL to reconstruct\nHamiltonians that are neither generic nor spatially local. We demonstrate the\nscalability and accuracy of our method with numerical simulations on up to 100\nqubits. These practical results are complemented by several theoretical\ncontributions.

Secondly, we introduce specific inversion blocks, that use the\nexplicit physical forward operator, to map the acquired measurements to the\nimage reconstruction. We also introduce registration blocks based deep nets to\npredict the registration parameters and warp transformation accurately and\nefficiently. We demonstrate, through extensive numerical and visual\nexperiments, that our framework outperforms significantly classic\nreconstruction schemes and other bi-task method; this in terms of both image\nquality and computational time. Finally, we show generalisation capabilities of\nour approach by demonstrating their performance on fast Magnetic Resonance\nImaging (MRI), sparse view computed tomography (CT) and low dose CT with\nmeasurements much below the Nyquist limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 19:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

Such spontaneous flows do not result in any net pumping for a\nuniform channel but greatly modify the distribution of transport of the\nchemical solute. The instability is predicted to occur for a solute P\\'eclet\nnumber above a critical value and for a band of finite perturbation\nwavenumbers.

In non-Hermitian\ngeneralizations of topological systems, however, this fundamental\ncorrespondence has recently been found to be qualitatively altered, largely\nowing to the sensitivity of non-Hermitian eigenspectra to changing the boundary\nconditions. In this work, we report on two contributions towards\ncomprehensively explaining this remarkable behavior unique to non-Hermitian\nsystems with theory. First, we analytically solve paradigmatic non-Hermitian\ntopological models for their zero-energy modes in the presence of generalized\nboundary conditions interpolating between open and periodic boundary\nconditions, thus explicitly following the breakdown of the conventional BBC.\nSecond, addressing the aforementioned spectral fragility of non-Hermitian\nmatrices, we investigate as to what extent the modified non-Hermitian BBC\nrepresents a robust and generically observable phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 20:25:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 08:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

We\nobtain the statistical population properties of sdB+NS binaries and provide\nsome guidance for observational efforts.

If one instead\ndraws more than one card at a time before reinserting, then the resulting\noperator is an example of a family of symmetrized shuffling operators studied\nby Victor Reiner, Franco Saliola and Volkmar Welker.\n  This thesis describes a way to obtain the eigenvalues of these operators. We\nbuild on the work of Anton Dieker and Franco Saliola, who computed the\neigenvalues of the random-to-random shuffle. Here, we compute the eigenvalues\nfor all the operators of the family. We proceed with the help of the\nrepresentation theory of the symmetric group. We decompose the vector space on\nwhich the shuffles act into simple modules for the symmetric group. These\nmodules correspond to standard Young tableaux, and the algorithm to compute the\neigenvalues is combinatorial because it computes the eigenvalues directly from\nthe standard Young tableaux.\n  As a corollary of our main result, we solve several conjectures of Reiner,\nSaliola and Welker, including showing that the eigenvalues are all nonnegative\nintegers. Furthermore, the techniques used here allow us to give a new proof of\ntheir result that these symmetrized shuffling operators commute.

A total of 29 W I\nspectral lines are observed from the two experiments using survey spectrometers\nbetween 200-400 nm with level identifications provided based on a structure\ncalculation for many of the excited states that produce strong emission lines.\nOf the 29 observed lines, 20 have not previously been reported in fusion\nrelevant plasmas, including an intense line at 265.65 nm which could be\nimportant for benchmarking the frequently exploited line at 400.88 nm. Nearly\nall of the observed spectral lines decay down to one of the six lowest energy\nlevels for neutral W, which are likely to be long-lived metastable states.

Manipulating the dynamics is especially interesting within the\ncontext of photo-magnonics. In typical $3d$ transition metal ferromagnets like\nCoFeB, the lifetime of light-induced magnetization dynamics is restricted to\nabout 1 ns, which e.g. strongly limits the opportunities to exploit the wave\nnature in a magnonic crystal filtering device. Here, we investigate the\npotential of spin-currents to increase the spin wave lifetime in a functional\nbilayer system, consisting of a heavy metal (8 nm of $\\beta$-Tantalum\n(Platinum)) and 5 nm CoFeB. Due to the spin Hall effect, the heavy metal layer\ngenerates a transverse spin current when a lateral charge current passes\nthrough the strip. Using time-resolved all-optical pump-probe spectroscopy, we\ninvestigate how this spin current affects the magnetization dynamics in the\nadjacent CoFeB layer. We observed a linear spin current manipulation of the\neffective Gilbert damping parameter for the Kittel mode from which we were able\nto determine the system's spin Hall angles. Furthermore, we measured a strong\ninfluence of the spin current on a high-frequency mode. We interpret this mode\nan an exchange dominated higher order spin-wave resonance.

Adversarial attack is a method that\ncauses the intended misclassfication by adding imperceptible perturbations to\nlegitimate inputs. Researchers have developed numerous types of adversarial\nattack methods. However, from the perspective of practical deployment, these\nmethods suffer from several drawbacks such as long attack generating time, high\nmemory cost, insufficient robustness and low transferability. We propose a\nContent-aware Adversarial Attack Generator (CAG) to achieve real-time,\nlow-cost, enhanced-robustness and high-transferability adversarial attack.\nFirst, as a type of generative model-based attack, CAG shows significant\nspeedup (at least 500 times) in generating adversarial examples compared to the\nstate-of-the-art attacks such as PGD and C\\&W. CAG only needs a single\ngenerative model to perform targeted attack to any targeted class. Because CAG\nencodes the label information into a trainable embedding layer, it differs from\nprior generative model-based adversarial attacks that use $n$ different copies\nof generative models for $n$ different targeted classes. As a result, CAG\nsignificantly reduces the required memory cost for generating adversarial\nexamples. CAG can generate adversarial perturbations that focus on the critical\nareas of input by integrating the class activation maps information in the\ntraining process, and hence improve the robustness of CAG attack against the\nstate-of-art adversarial defenses. In addition, CAG exhibits high\ntransferability across different DNN classifier models in black-box attack\nscenario by introducing random dropout in the process of generating\nperturbations. Extensive experiments on different datasets and DNN models have\nverified the real-time, low-cost, enhanced-robustness, and high-transferability\nbenefits of CAG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 22:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

Yet, solving large-scale inverse problems\nlike tomographic reconstruction remains challenging for DL. These problems\ninvolve non-local and space-variant integral transforms between the input and\noutput domains, for which no efficient neural network models have been found. A\nprior attempt to solve such problems with supervised learning relied on a\nbrute-force fully connected network and applied it to reconstruction for a\n$128^4$ system matrix size. This cannot practically scale to realistic data\nsizes such as $512^4$ and $512^6$ for three-dimensional data sets. Here we\npresent a novel framework to solve such problems with deep learning by casting\nthe original problem as a continuum of intermediate representations between the\ninput and output data. The original problem is broken down into a sequence of\nsimpler transformations that can be well mapped onto an efficient hierarchical\nnetwork architecture, with exponentially fewer parameters than a generic\nnetwork would need. We applied the approach to computed tomography (CT) image\nreconstruction for a $512^4$ system matrix size. To our knowledge, this enabled\nthe first data-driven DL solver for full-size CT reconstruction without relying\non the structure of direct (analytical) or iterative (numerical) inversion\ntechniques. The proposed approach is applicable to other imaging problems such\nas emission and magnetic resonance reconstruction.

Additional resource allocation at the network level, such\nas AV-exclusive lanes, can further foster the usage of AVs rendering this mode\nof travel more attractive than legacy vehicles (LV). However, it is necessary\nto find the crucial locations in the network where providing these dedicated\nlanes would reap the maximum benefits. In this study, we propose an integrated\nmixed-integer programming framework for optimal AV-exclusive lane design on\nfreeway networks which accounts for commuters' demand split among AVs and LVs\nvia a logit model incorporating class-based utilities. We incorporate the link\ntransmission model (LTM) as the underlying traffic flow model due to its\ncomputational efficiency for system optimum dynamic traffic assignment. The LTM\nis modified to integrate two vehicle classes namely, LVs and AVs with a\nlane-based approach. The presence of binary variables to represent lane design\nand the logit model for endogenous demand estimation results in a nonconvex\nmixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) formulation.

As a result, they have been\nwidely adopted across a variety of applications, ranging from challenging\ninverse problems like image completion, to problems such as anomaly detection\nand adversarial defense. A recurring theme in many of these applications is the\nnotion of projecting an image observation onto the manifold that is inferred by\nthe generator. In this context, Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) has been the\nmost popular approach, which essentially optimizes for a latent vector that\nminimizes the discrepancy between a generated image and the given observation.\nHowever, PGD is a brittle optimization technique that fails to identify the\nright projection (or latent vector) when the observation is corrupted, or\nperturbed even by a small amount. Such corruptions are common in the real\nworld, for example images in the wild come with unknown crops, rotations,\nmissing pixels, or other kinds of non-linear distributional shifts which break\ncurrent encoding methods, rendering downstream applications unusable. To\naddress this, we propose corruption mimicking -- a new robust projection\ntechnique, that utilizes a surrogate network to approximate the unknown\ncorruption directly at test time, without the need for additional supervision\nor data augmentation. The proposed method is significantly more robust than PGD\nand other competing methods under a wide variety of corruptions, thereby\nenabling a more effective use of GANs in real-world applications.

We show\nthat such algorithms are possible via Generative Teaching Networks (GTNs), a\ngeneral approach that is, in theory, applicable to supervised, unsupervised,\nand reinforcement learning, although our experiments only focus on the\nsupervised case. GTNs are deep neural networks that generate data and/or\ntraining environments that a learner (e.g. a freshly initialized neural\nnetwork) trains on for a few SGD steps before being tested on a target task. We\nthen differentiate through the entire learning process via meta-gradients to\nupdate the GTN parameters to improve performance on the target task. GTNs have\nthe beneficial property that they can theoretically generate any type of data\nor training environment, making their potential impact large.

Experiments with anionic,\ncationic and nonionic surfactants with different head groups and chain lengths\nare performed in a wide concentration range, from 0.001 mM to 100 mM. The\nelectrolyte concentration is also varied from 0 up to 100 mM. For all\nsurfactants studied, three regions in the dependence of the foamability, VA, on\nthe logarithm of surfactant concentration, lgCS, are observed. In Region 1, VA\nis very low and depends weakly on CS. In Region 2, VA increases steeply with\nCS. In Region 3, VA reaches a plateau. A key new element in our interpretation\nof the foaming data is that we use the surface tension measurements to\ndetermine the dependence of the main surface properties (surfactant adsorption,\nsurface coverage and surface elasticity) on the surface age of the bubbles. In\nthis way we interpret the results from the foaming tests by considering the\nproperties of the dynamic adsorption layers, formed during foaming. The data\nfor the nonionic and ionic surfactants merge around two master curves when\nplotted as a function of the surface coverage, the surface mobility factor, or\nthe Gibbs elasticity of the dynamic adsorption layers. This difference between\nthe ionic and nonionic surfactants is explained with the important contribution\nof the electrostatic repulsion between the foam film surfaces for the ionic\nsurfactants which stabilizes the dynamic foam films even at moderate surface\ncoverage and at relatively high ionic strength. In contrast, the films formed\nfrom solutions of nonionic surfactants are stabilized via steric repulsion\nwhich becomes sufficiently high to prevent bubble coalescence only at rather\nhigh surface coverage (> 90 %) which corresponds to related high Gibbs\nelasticity (> 150 mN/m) and low surface mobility of the dynamic adsorption\nlayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 08:34:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

Although anyons\nare predicted to be realized in certain fractional quantum Hall systems, they\nhave not yet been unambiguously detected in experiment. Here we introduce a\nsimple quantum impurity model, where bosonic or fermionic impurities turn into\nanyons as a consequence of their interaction with the surrounding many-particle\nbath. A cloud of phonons dresses each impurity in such a way that it\neffectively attaches fluxes/vortices to it and thereby converts it into an\nAbelian anyon. The corresponding quantum impurity model, first, provides a new\napproach to the numerical solution of the many-anyon problem, along with a new\nconcrete perspective of anyons as emergent quasiparticles built from composite\nbosons or fermions. More importantly, the model paves the way towards realizing\nanyons using impurities in crystal lattices as well as ultracold gases. In\nparticular, we consider two heavy electrons interacting with a two-dimensional\nlattice crystal in a magnetic field, and show that when the impurity-bath\nsystem is rotated at the cyclotron frequency, impurities behave as anyons as a\nconsequence of the angular momentum exchange between the impurities and the\nbath. A possible experimental realization is proposed by identifying the\nstatistics parameter in terms of the mean square distance of the impurities and\nthe magnetization of the impurity-bath system, both of which are accessible to\nexperiment. Another proposed application are impurities immersed in a\ntwo-dimensional weakly interacting Bose gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 09:28:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 18:23:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-29"}

Most existing computer vision\napproaches are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although the\nCNN-based approaches can achieve high detection accuracy, their high energy\nconsumption is a severe drawback. To resolve this problem, novel energy\nefficient approaches should be explored. Spiking neural network (SNN) is a\npromising candidate because it has orders-of-magnitude lower energy consumption\nthan CNN. Unfortunately, the studying of SNN has been limited in small networks\nonly. The application of SNN for large 3D object detection networks has remain\nlargely open. In this paper, we integrate spiking convolutional neural network\n(SCNN) with temporal coding into the YOLOv2 architecture for real-time object\ndetection. To take the advantage of spiking signals, we develop a novel data\npreprocessing layer that translates 3D point-cloud data into spike time data.\nWe propose an analog circuit to implement the non-leaky integrate and fire\nneuron used in our SCNN, from which the energy consumption of each spike is\nestimated. Moreover, we present a method to calculate the network sparsity and\nthe energy consumption of the overall network. Extensive experiments have been\nconducted based on the KITTI dataset, which show that the proposed network can\nreach competitive detection accuracy as existing approaches, yet with much\nlower average energy consumption.

Recent advances in CQA answer selection focus on\nenhancing the performance by incorporating the community information,\nparticularly the expertise (previous answers) and authority (position in the\nsocial network) of an answerer. However, existing approaches for incorporating\nsuch information are limited in (a) only considering either the expertise or\nthe authority, but not both; (b) ignoring the domain knowledge to differentiate\ntopics of previous answers; and (c) simply using the authority information to\nadjust the similarity score, instead of fully utilizing it in the process of\nmeasuring the similarity between segments of the question and the answer. We\npropose the Knowledge-enhanced Attentive Answer Selection (KAAS) model, which\nenhances the performance through (a) considering both the expertise and the\nauthority of the answerer; (b) utilizing the human-labeled tags, the taxonomy\nof the tags, and the votes as the domain knowledge to infer the expertise of\nthe answer; (c) using matrix decomposition of the social network (formed by\nfollowing-relationship) to infer the authority of the answerer and\nincorporating such information in the process of evaluating the similarity\nbetween segments. Besides, for vertical community, we incorporate an external\nknowledge graph to capture more professional information for vertical CQA\nsystems. Then we adopt the attention mechanism to integrate the analysis of the\ntext of questions and answers and the aforementioned community information.\nExperiments with both vertical and general CQA sites demonstrate the superior\nperformance of the proposed KAAS model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 10:33:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

However,\nefficient scaling of HHG towards x-ray energies has been hampered by\nionization-induced plasma generation impeding the coherent buildup of\nhigh-harmonic radiation. Recently, it has been shown that these limitations can\nbe overcome in the so-called 'overdriven regime' where ionization loss and\nplasma dispersion strongly modify the driving laser pulse over small distances,\nalbeit without demonstrating IAPs. Here, we report on experiments comparing the\ngeneration of IAPs in argon and neon at 80 eV via attosecond streaking\nmeasurements. Contrasting our experimental results with numerical simulations,\nwe conclude that IAPs in argon are generated through ionization-induced\ntransient phase-matching gating effective over distances on the order of 100\n$\\mu$m. We show that the decay of the intensity and blue-shift due to plasma\ndefocussing are crucial for allowing phase-matching close to the XUV cutoff at\nhigh plasma densities.

In spite of the efficiency\nof tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI; Imatinib), other strategies are explored to\neliminate CML leukemia stem cells, such as calcium pathways. Results: In this\nwork, we showed that Store-Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE) and thrombin induced\ncalcium influx were decreased in Bcr-Abl expressing 32d cells (32d-p210). The\n32d-p210 cells showed modified Orai1/STIM1 ratio and reduced TRPC1 expression\nthat could explain SOCE reduction. Decrease in SOCE and thrombin induced\ncalcium entry was associated to reduced Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells\n(NFAT) nucleus translocation in 32d-p210 cells. We demonstrated that SOCE\nblockers enhanced cell mobility of 32d-p210 cells and reduced the proliferation\nrate in both 32d cell lines.

However, the usage of Flying Multi-hop Networks (FMNs) in\nsuch scenarios brings up significant challenges concerning network routing, in\norder to permanently provide the Quality of Service expected by the users. The\nproblem is exacerbated in crowded events, where the FMN may be formed by many\nUAVs to address the traffic demand, causing inter-flow interference within the\nFMN. Typically, estimating inter-flow interference is not straightforward and\nrequires the exchange of probe packets, thus increasing network overhead. The\nmain contribution of this paper is an inter-flow interference-aware routing\nmetric, named I2R, designed for centralized routing in FMNs with controllable\ntopology. I2R does not require any control packets and enables the\nconfiguration of paths with minimal Euclidean distance formed by UAVs with the\nlowest number of neighbors in carrier-sense range, thus minimizing inter-flow\ninterference in the FMN. Simulation results show the I2R superior performance,\nwith significant gains in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay, when\ncompared with state of the art routing metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 11:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

In particular, we\nshow that three distinct macroscopic collective behaviors can be observed: i)\nthe coarsening of aggregates with no orientational order, ii) the emergence of\nstatic, elongated nematic bands, and iii) the formation of moving, locally\npolar structures, which we call worms. The derived hydrodynamic equations\nindicate that active particles interacting via position-based interactions\nbelong to a distinct class of active systems fundamentally different from other\nactive systems, including velocity-alignment-based flocking systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 12:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

Their\noscillatory counterparts, geodesic acoustic modes (GAMs), appear due to the\naction of the magnetic field curvature. The GAMs can be driven unstable by an\nanisotropic energetic particle (EP) population leading to the formation of\nglobal radial structures, called EGAMs. The EGAMs can redistribute EP energy to\nthe bulk plasma through collisionless wave-particle interaction. In such a way,\nthe EGAMs might contribute to the plasma heating. Thus, investigation of EGAM\nproperties, especially in the velocity space, is necessary for precise\nunderstanding of the transport phenomena in tokamak plasmas.\n  In this work, the nonlinear dynamics of EGAMs without considering the mode\ninteraction with the turbulence is investigated with the help of a\nMode-Particle-Resonance (MPR) diagnostic implemented in the global gyrokinetic\nparticle-in-cell code ORB5.

The analysis is based on\nresults obtained in [Verschaeve et al. (2018)] showing the inviscid character\nof the growth mechanism of these waves. In particular, it is shown that the\nformulation of this growth mechanism naturally reduces to the eigenvalue\nproblem for the energy bound formulated by [Davis and von Kerczek (1973)]. This\neigenvalue equation thus allows for a broader interpretation. It provides the\ndiscrete growth rates for the base flow in question. In addition to this\neigenvalue problem, a corresponding eigenvalue problem for the phase speed of\nthe perturbations can be extracted from the equations found in [Verschaeve et\nal. (2018)]. These two eigenvalue equations relate to the Hermitian and\nskew-Hermitian part, respectively, of the nonmodal equations, cf. [Schmid\n(2007)]. In contrast to traditional Orr-Sommerfeld modal analysis, the above\neigenvalue equations define an orthogonal set of eigenfunctions allowing to\ndecompose the perturbation into base perturbations. As a result of this\ndecomposition, it can be shown that the evolution of two-dimensional\nperturbations is governed by two mechanisms: A first one, responsible for\nextracting and returning energy from and to the base flow, in addition to\nviscous dissipation and, a second one, responsible for dispersing energy among\nthe different base perturbations constituting the perturbation. As a general\nresult, we show that the stability of a flow is not only determined by the\ngrowth rates of the base perturbations, but it is also closely related to its\nability to disperse energy away from the base perturbations with positive\ngrowth.

Recently, promising results have\nbeen reported by methods relying on convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)\npretrained on large-scale image datasets. However, these methods have\ndifficulties in synthesizing image textures with non-local structures and\nextending to dynamic or sound textures. In this paper, we present a conditional\ngenerative ConvNet (cgCNN) model which combines deep statistics and the\nprobabilistic framework of generative ConvNet (gCNN) model. Given a texture\nexemplar, the cgCNN model defines a conditional distribution using deep\nstatistics of a ConvNet, and synthesize new textures by sampling from the\nconditional distribution. In contrast to previous deep texture models, the\nproposed cgCNN dose not rely on pre-trained ConvNets but learns the weights of\nConvNets for each input exemplar instead. As a result, the cgCNN model can\nsynthesize high quality dynamic, sound and image textures in a unified manner.\nWe also explore the theoretical connections between our model and other texture\nmodels. Further investigations show that the cgCNN model can be easily\ngeneralized to texture expansion and inpainting.

Recent observational analysis has\nrevealed the so-called decay-less small-amplitude oscillations, with a\nmulti-harmonic structure being detected. Several models have been proposed to\nexplain them. In particular, decay-less oscillations have been described in\nterms of standing kink waves driven with continuous monoperiodic motions of\nloop footpoints, in terms of a simple oscillator model of forced oscillations\ndue to harmonic external force, and as a self-oscillatory process due to the\ninteraction of a loop with quasi-steady flows.

In contrast, this paper goes beyond the average AoI to improve\nURLLC in a vehicular communication network by characterizing and controlling\nthe AoI tail distribution. In particular, the transmission power minimization\nproblem is studied under stringent URLLC constraints in terms of probabilistic\nAoI for both deterministic and Markovian traffic arrivals. Accordingly, an\nefficient novel mapping between AoI and queue-related distributions is\nproposed. Subsequently, extreme value theory (EVT) and Lyapunov optimization\ntechniques are adopted to formulate and solve the problem considering both long\nand short packets transmissions. Simulation results show over a two-fold\nimprovement, in shortening the AoI distribution tail, versus a baseline that\nmodels the maximum queue length distribution, in addition to a tradeoff between\narrival rate and AoI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 12:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

In particular, two conductance\nplateaus of $G=2e^2/h$ appear in the vicinity of the electron energy $E=\\pm\n\\gamma$. When the scattering region is partially covered by homogeneous\nadsorbates ($0<n_i<1$), the transmission gap still survives around the Dirac\npoint even at low $n_i$, and its width is firstly increased by $n_i$ and then\ndeclined by further increasing $n_i$; whereas the conductance decreases with\n$n_i$ in the regime of low $n_i$ and increases with $n_i$ in the regime of high\n$n_i$. While in the presence of disordered adsorbates whose on-site energies\nare random variables characterized by the disorder degree, the transmission gap\ndisappears at low $n_i$ and reappears at relatively high $n_i$.

At low energy the system shows regular behavior that\nproduces a deformation-induced rotation with a constant averaged angular\nvelocity. As the energy is increased this behavior makes way to a chaotic\nregime with rotational behavior statistically resembling L\\'evy walks and\nrandom walks. At high enough energies, where the rest lengths become\nnegligible, the chaotic signature vanishes and the system returns to\nregularity, with a single dominant frequency. The transition to and from chaos,\nas well as the anomalous power law statistics measured for the angular\ndisplacement of the harmonic three mass system are largely governed by the\nstructure of regular solutions of this mixed Hamiltonian system. Thus a deeper\nunderstating of the system's irregular behavior requires mapping out its\nregular solutions.\n  In this work we provide a comprehensive analysis of the system's regular\nregimes of motion, using perturbative methods to derive analytical expressions\nof the system as almost-integrable in its low- and high-energy extremes.

In\nthe low-energy regime, the Birkhoff normal form method is utilized to\ncircumvent the low-order 1:1 resonance of the system, and the conditions for\nKolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory are shown to hold. The integrable approximations\nprovide the back-bone structure around which the behavior of the full\nnon-linear system is organized, and provide a pathway to understanding the\norigin of the power-law statistics measured in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 13:04:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

Since the number of coefficients of the\ncascaded channel among the base station (BS), the RIS and the user equipments\n(UEs) is the product of the number of BS antennas, the number of RIS elements,\nand the number of UEs, the pilot overhead can be prohibitively high. In this\npaper, we propose a two-timescale channel estimation framework to exploit the\nproperty that the BS-RIS channel is high-dimensional but quasi-static, while\nthe RIS-UE channel is mobile but low-dimensional. Specifically, to estimate the\nquasi-static BS-RIS channel, we propose a dual-link pilot transmission scheme,\nwhere the BS transmits downlink pilots and receives uplink pilots reflected by\nthe RIS. Then, we propose a coordinate descent-based algorithm to recover the\nBS-RIS channel. Since the quasi-static BS-RIS channel is estimated less\nfrequently than the mobile channel be, the average pilot overhead can be\nreduced from a long-term perspective. Although the mobile RIS-UE channel has to\nbe frequently estimated in a small timescale, the associated pilot overhead is\nlow thanks to its low dimension.

As part of an ongoing effort to\nuncover and control systematic uncertainties, we investigate three potential\nsources: 1- stellar kinematics, 2- line-of-sight effects, and 3- the deflector\nmass model. To meet this goal in a quantitative way, we reproduced the\nH0LiCOW/SHARP/STRIDES (hereafter TDCOSMO) procedures on a set of real and\nsimulated data, and we find the following. First, stellar kinematics cannot be\na dominant source of error or bias since we find that a systematic change of\n10% of measured velocity dispersion leads to only a 0.7% shift on $H_0$ from\nthe seven lenses analyzed by TDCOSMO. Second, we find no bias to arise from\nincorrect estimation of the line-of-sight effects. Third, we show that\nelliptical composite (stars + dark matter halo), power-law, and cored power-law\nmass profiles have the flexibility to yield a broad range in $H_0$ values.\nHowever, the TDCOSMO procedures that model the data with both composite and\npower-law mass profiles are informative. If the models agree, as we observe in\nreal systems owing to the \"bulge-halo\" conspiracy, $H_0$ is recovered precisely\nand accurately by both models. If the two models disagree, as in the case of\nsome pathological models illustrated here, the TDCOSMO procedure either\ndiscriminates between them through the goodness of fit, or it accounts for the\ndiscrepancy in the final error bars provided by the analysis. This conclusion\nis consistent with a reanalysis of six of the TDCOSMO (real) lenses: the\ncomposite model yields $74.0^{+1.7}_{-1.8}$ $km.s^{-1}.Mpc^{-1}$, while the\npower-law model yields $H_0=74.2^{+1.6}_{-1.6}$ $km.s^{-1}.Mpc^{-1}$.

Such spaces provide a general and natural\nsetting in order to understand what kind of anisotropic smoothness can be\ndescribed using hyperbolic wavelets (in the literature also sometimes called\ntensor-product wavelets), a wavelet class which hitherto has been mainly used\nto characterize spaces of dominating mixed smoothness.\n  A centerpiece of our present work are characterizations of these new spaces\nbased on the hyperbolic wavelet transform. Hereby we treat both, the standard\napproach using wavelet systems equipped with sufficient smoothness, decay, and\nvanishing moments, but also the very simple and basic hyperbolic Haar system.\n  The second major question we pursue is the relationship between the novel\nhyperbolic spaces and the classical anisotropic Besov-Lizorkin-Triebel scales.\nAs our results show, in general, both approaches to resolve an anisotropy do\nnot coincide. However, in the Sobolev range this is the case, providing a link\nto apply the newly obtained hyperbolic wavelet characterizations to the\nclassical setting.

A plausible\nexplanation is that most discovered planets are located on close-in orbits,\nwhich would make their moons prone to tidal evolution and orbital detachment.\nIn recent models of tidally-driven migration of exomoons, evolving planets\nmight prevent what was considered their most plausible fate (i.e. colliding\nagainst their host planet), favouring scenarios where moons are pushed away and\nreach what we define as the \"satellite tidal orbital parking\" distance\n($a_\\mathrm{stop}$), which is often within the critical limit for unstable\norbits and depends mainly on the system's initial conditions: mass-ratio,\nsemi-major axes, and rotational rates.

Moreover, any detection, confirmation, and\nfull characterisation would require both the short cadence capabilities of TESS\nand high photometric sensitivity of ground-based observatories.

In particular, we focus\non a goal-oriented approach that substantially improves the accuracy of reduced\nmodels by learning the error between the forward model and the ROM outputs.\nOnce an ML-enhanced ROM is constructed it can accelerate the performance of\nsolving many-query problems in parametrized forward and inverse problems.\nNumerical results for inverse problems governed by elliptic PDEs and\nparametrized neutron transport equations will be presented to support our\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 13:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-20"}

This gap mainly stems from two\nfactors: 1) The absence of a controller, making the data collected dissimilar\nto actual control. 2) The difficulty of including the four main dynamic factors\n(gesture intensity, limb position, electrode shift, and transient changes in\nthe signal), as including their permutations drastically increases the amount\nof data to be recorded.

Consequently, this\npaper proposes a new type of dataset to serve as an intermediate between\noffline and online datasets, by recording the data using a real-time\nexperimental protocol. The protocol, performed in virtual reality, includes the\nfour main dynamic factors and uses an EMG-independent controller to guide\nmovements. This EMG-independent feedback ensures that the user is in-the-loop\nduring recording, while enabling the resulting dynamic dataset to be used as an\nEMG-based benchmark.

In the area\nof machine learning and data science, a tree-like model as that of decision\ntree is considered as one of the most popular classification techniques, which\ncan be used to build a data-driven predictive model. The traditional decision\ntree model typically creates a number of leaf nodes as decision nodes that\nrepresent context-specific rigid decisions, and consequently may cause\noverfitting problem in behavior modeling. However, in many practical scenarios\nwithin the context-aware environment, the generalized outcomes could play an\nimportant role to effectively capture user behavior. In this paper, we propose\na behavioral decision tree, \"BehavDT\" context-aware model that takes into\naccount user behavior-oriented generalization according to individual\npreference level. The BehavDT model outputs not only the generalized decisions\nbut also the context-specific decisions in relevant exceptional cases. The\neffectiveness of our BehavDT model is studied by conducting experiments on\nindividual user real smartphone datasets. Our experimental results show that\nthe proposed BehavDT context-aware model is more effective when compared with\nthe traditional machine learning approaches, in predicting user diverse\nbehaviors considering multi-dimensional contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 08:58:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-06"}

Meantime, the SbGa\nantisite defects can effectively decrease the energy barrier of substitution\nprocess, from 0.85 eV to 0.53 eV. The diffusion of V atom in GaSb lattice is\nthrough meta-stable interstitial sites with an energy barrier of 0.6 eV. At a\nlow V concentration x = 0.0625, V atoms prefer a homogeneous distribution and\nan antiferromagnetic coupling among them. However, starting from x = 0.5, the\nmagnetic coupling among V atoms changes to be ferromagnetic, due to enhanced\nsuperexchange interaction between eg and t2g states of neighbouring V atoms.
