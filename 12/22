(2018) can be calibrated on the basis of\nreference auditory brainstem responses. Additionally, the filter design used in\ntwo of the model stages, cochlear nucleus (CN) and inferior colliculus (IC), is\ndescribed in detail. These descriptions are valid for a new release of the\nVerhulst et al. model, version 1.2, as well as for previous versions of the\nmodel (version 1.1 or earlier). The differences between the model versions are\nexplicitly mentioned and simulations to basic auditory stimuli are shown for\nmodel versions 1.1 and 1.2. In short, version 1.2 of the model includes a new\nimplementation of the CN and IC stages (Stages 5 and 6). All previous model\nstages (Stages 1-4: outer and middle ear, transmission-line cochlear filter\nbank, inner hair cell model, and auditory nerve model) remained unchanged. In\nthe new release (model version 1.2), in addition to the updated CN and IC\nstages, we employed a different calibration procedure to match human reference\nABR amplitudes of waves I, III, and V more faithfully. This release note shows\nthe implications of these model adjustments on the simulations presented in the\noriginal 2018 model paper. For this purpose, results from two model versions\nare reported: (1) New model release (version 1.2), labelled as model v1.2; and\n(2) Previous model release as used by Verhulst et al., labelled as model v1.1.\nThe main difference between IC model stages relates to the degree of IC\ninhibition that was applied, with more inhibition in v1.2 than implemented in\nv1.1. The time domain simulations presented in this document show that this\nchange in inhibition strength does not drastically change the results presented\nin the original paper. However, v1.2 more correctly captures the\nphysiologically derived CN and IC inhibition/excitation strengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Dec 2019 22:44:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

The extended Lagrangian contains an additional field variable that\nis forced to follow the wave function of the quantum state through a rapidly\noscillating extended harmonic oscillator. By considering the adiabatic limit\nfor large frequencies of the harmonic oscillator, we can derive the two\nequations of motions, a Schr\\\"odinger-type equation for the quantum state and a\nwave equation for the extended field variable. The equations are coupled in a\nnonlinear way, but each equation individually is linear with respect to the\nvariable that it defines.

However, how to effectively integrate an\nexternal language model into such recognizer is still a challenging problem.\nThe main challenge faced when training a language model is to deal with the\nlanguage model corpus which is usually different to the one used for training\nthe handwritten word recognition system. Thus, the bias between both word\ncorpora leads to incorrectness on the transcriptions, providing similar or even\nworse performances on the recognition task. In this work, we introduce\nCandidate Fusion, a novel way to integrate an external language model to a\nsequence-to-sequence architecture. Moreover, it provides suggestions from an\nexternal language knowledge, as a new input to the sequence-to-sequence\nrecognizer. Hence, Candidate Fusion provides two improvements. On the one hand,\nthe sequence-to-sequence recognizer has the flexibility not only to combine the\ninformation from itself and the language model, but also to choose the\nimportance of the information provided by the language model. On the other\nhand, the external language model has the ability to adapt itself to the\ntraining corpus and even learn the most commonly errors produced from the\nrecognizer. Finally, by conducting comprehensive experiments, the Candidate\nFusion proves to outperform the state-of-the-art language models for\nhandwritten word recognition tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Dec 2019 18:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

The proof follows from an unexpected journey through an array\nof topics: the closed form optimal decoder for Gaussian VAEs, a proof that the\ndecoder is always smooth, a proof that the ELBO at its stationary points is\nequal to the exact log evidence, and the posterior variance is merely part of a\nstochastic estimator of the decoder Hessian. The penalty incurred from using a\nconstant posterior variance is small under mild conditions, and otherwise\ndiscourages large variations in the decoder Hessian. From here we derive a\nsimplified formulation of the ELBO as an expectation over a batch, which we\ncall the Batch Information Lower Bound (BILBO). Despite the use of Gaussians,\nour analysis is broadly applicable -- it extends to any likelihood function\nthat induces a Riemannian metric.

Using the split Hamiltonian FE framework (Bauer, Behrens and Cotter,\n2019), we result in structure-preserving discretizations that are split into\ntopological prognostic and metric-dependent closure equations. This splitting\nalso accounts for the schemes' properties: the Poisson bracket is responsible\nfor conserving energy (Hamiltonian) as well as mass, potential vorticity and\nenstrophy (Casimirs), independently from the realizations of the metric closure\nequations. The latter, in turn, determine accuracy, stability, convergence and\ndiscrete dispersion properties. We exploit this splitting to introduce\nstructure-preserving approximations of the mass matrices in the metric\nequations avoiding to solve linear systems.

We\ninvestigated AGN fraction in one of the largest samples of X-ray selected\nclusters from the ROSAT and their immediate surrounding field regions below z <\n0.5.

The lower AGN fractions in clusters were measured,\nafter dividing the clusters into five redshift intervals between 0.0 and 0.5,\nin each redshift interval, and we found an increase in the fraction for both\ncluster and field galaxies with redshift below z < 0.5, which clearly indicates\nan environment and redshift dependence.

Their potential\nfor optoelectronics stems from the possibility to tailor the spectral response\nover a broad range by exploiting interlayer transitions between different\ncompounds with an appropriate band-edge alignment. For the interlayer\ntransitions to be radiative, however, a serious challenge comes from details of\nthe materials --such as lattice mismatch or even a small misalignment of the\nconstituent layers-- that can drastically suppress the electron-photon\ncoupling. The problem was evidenced in recent studies of heterostructures of\nmonolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, whose band edges are located at the\nK-point of reciprocal space. Here we demonstrate experimentally that the\nsolution to the interlayer coupling problem is to engineer type-II interfaces\nby assembling atomically thin crystals that have the bottom of the conduction\nband and the top of the valence band at the $\\Gamma$-point, thus avoiding any\nmomentum mismatch. We find that this type of vdW interfaces exhibits radiative\noptical transition irrespective of lattice constant, rotational/translational\nalignment of the two layers, or whether the constituent materials are direct or\nindirect gap semiconductors.

The system has two\nmajor constituent modules: a fully automatic and robust peg free segmentation\nand pose normalisation module, and a recognition module. In the first module,\nthe hand is segmented from its background using a thresholding technique based\non Otsu`s method combined with a skin colour detector. A set of fully automatic\nalgorithms are then proposed to segment the palm and fingers. In these\nalgorithms, the skeleton and the contour of the hand and fingers are estimated\nand used to determine the global pose of the hand and the pose of each\nindividual finger. Finally the palm and fingers are cropped, pose corrected and\nnormalised. In the recognition module, various shape and texture based features\nare extracted and used for matching purposes. The modified Hausdorff distance,\nthe Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA)\nalgorithms are used for shape and texture features of the fingers. For the\npalmprints, we use the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), directional line\nfeatures and ICA.

Though raised great concerns, such adversarial\nattacks can be leveraged to estimate the robustness of NLP models. Compared\nwith the adversarial example generation in continuous data domain (e.g.,\nimage), generating adversarial text that preserves the original meaning is\nchallenging since the text space is discrete and non-differentiable. To handle\nthese challenges, we propose a target-controllable adversarial attack framework\nT3, which is applicable to a range of NLP tasks. In particular, we propose a\ntree-based autoencoder to embed the discrete text data into a continuous\nrepresentation space, upon which we optimize the adversarial perturbation. A\nnovel tree-based decoder is then applied to regularize the syntactic\ncorrectness of the generated text and manipulate it on either sentence\n(T3(Sent)) or word (T3(Word)) level.

Extensive experimental\nresults and human studies show that T3 generated adversarial texts can\nsuccessfully manipulate the NLP models to output the targeted incorrect answer\nwithout misleading the human.

The source region first appeared as a bipole, which subsequently\nexperienced a rapid emergence followed by a long-term decay. Correspondingly,\nthe coronal structure initially appeared as arc-like loops, then gradually\nsheared and transformed into continuously sigmoidal loops, mainly owing to flux\ncancellation near the polarity inversion line. The temperature of J-shaped and\nsigmoidal loops is estimated to be about $2.0\\times10^{6}$ K, greater than that\nof the background coronal hole. Using the flux-rope insertion method, we\nfurther reconstruct the nonlinear force-free fields that well reproduces the\ntransformation of the potential field into a sigmoidal field. The fact that the\nsheared and sigmoidal loops are mainly concentrated at around the high-Q region\nimplies that the reconnection most likely takes place there to form the\nsigmoidal field and heat the plasma.

However, since the HR facial image\nreconstruction using CNN is conventionally aimed to increase the PSNR and SSIM\nmetrics, the reconstructed HR image might not be realistic even with high\nscores. An adversarial framework is proposed in this study to reconstruct the\nHR facial image by simultaneously generating an HR image with and without blur.\nFirst, the spatial resolution of the LR facial image is increased by eight\ntimes using a five-layer CNN. Then, the encoder extracts the features of the\nup-scaled image. These features are finally sent to two branches (decoders) to\ngenerate an HR facial image with and without blur. In addition, local and\nglobal discriminators are combined to focus on the reconstruction of HR facial\nstructures. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm generates a\nrealistic HR facial image. Furthermore, the proposed method can generate a\nvariety of different facial images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 12:03:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

In attempting to solve the fluctuation\nequations that are automatically written in terms of gauge-invariant\ncombinations of these components, the equations are taken to break up into\nseparate SVT sectors, the decomposition theorem. Here, without needing to\nspecify a gauge, we solve the fluctuation equations exactly for some standard\ncosmologies, to show that in general the various gauge-invariant combinations\nonly separate at a higher-derivative level. To achieve separation at the level\nof the fluctuation equations themselves one has to assume boundary conditions\nfor the higher-derivative equations. While asymptotic conditions suffice for\nfluctuations around a dS background or a $k=0$ RW background, for fluctuations\naround a $k\\neq 0$ RW background one additionally has to require that the\nfluctuations be well-behaved at the origin. We show that in certain cases the\ngauge-invariant combinations themselves involve both scalars and vectors. For\nsuch cases there is no decomposition theorem for the individual SVT components\nthemselves, but for the gauge-invariant combinations there still can be. Given\nthe lack of manifest covariance in defining a basis with respect to\n3-dimensional rotations, we introduce an alternate SVT basis whose components\nare defined according to how they transform under 4-dimensional general\ncoordinate transformations. With this basis the fluctuation equations greatly\nsimplify, and while one can again break them up into separate gauge-invariant\nsectors at the higher-derivative level, in general we find that even with\nboundary conditions we do not obtain a decomposition theorem in which the\nfluctuations separate at the level of the fluctuation equations themselves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 13:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

The focus of this work is to propose a\nhybrid opportunistic energy efficient routing design for large scale, low power\nand lossy WSN. This design avoids periodic 'hello' beacons for NM, limits\nconstant overhearing and increase in packet header length. There are two modes\nof operation i) opportunistic ii) unicast mode. The sender node adopts\nopportunistic forwarding for its initial data packet transmission and instead\nof pre-computing the FCS, it is dynamically computed in a completely\ndistributed manner. The nodes part of FCS based on cross layered multi-metrics\nand fuzzy decision logic determines its priority level to compute Dynamic\nHolding Delay (DHD) for effective timer coordination. The differentiated back\noff implementation along with DHD enables the higher priority candidate that\nhad received data packet to forward the packet first and facilitates others to\ncancel its timer upon overhearing. The sender node switches to unicast mode for\nsuccessive transmissions to achieve energy efficiency till link-level\ntransmission error occur. Opportunistic mode is used as the first and last\nresort to increase the transmission reliability.

Data-driven techniques\nprovide a systematic route to constructing this landscape, without the need for\nextensive a priori intuition into the relevant driving forces. In particular,\nautoencoders are powerful tools for dimensionality reduction, as they naturally\nforce an information bottleneck and, thereby, a low-dimensional embedding of\nthe essential features. While variational autoencoders ensure continuity of the\nembedding by assuming a unimodal Gaussian prior, this is at odds with the\nmulti-basin free-energy landscapes that typically arise from the identification\nof meaningful collective variables. In this work, we incorporate this physical\nintuition into the prior by employing a Gaussian mixture variational\nautoencoder (GMVAE), which encourages the separation of metastable states\nwithin the embedding. The GMVAE performs dimensionality reduction and\nclustering within a single unified framework, and is capable of identifying the\ninherent dimensionality of the input data, in terms of the number of Gaussians\nrequired to categorize the data. We illustrate our approach on two toy models,\nalanine dipeptide, and a challenging disordered peptide ensemble, demonstrating\nthe enhanced clustering effect of the GMVAE prior compared to standard VAEs.\nThe resulting embeddings appear to be promising representations for\nconstructing Markov state models, highlighting the transferability of the\ndimensionality reduction from static equilibrium properties to dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 15:30:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-30"}

Existing algorithms (based on dynamic programming) suffer\nfrom a major limitation: their runtimes scale cubically with the RNA length,\nand this slowness limits their use in genome-wide applications.\n  Results: We present a novel alternative $O(n^3)$-time dynamic programming\nalgorithm for RNA folding that is amenable to heuristics that make it run in\n$O(n)$ time and $O(n)$ space, while producing a high-quality approximation to\nthe optimal solution. Inspired by incremental parsing for context-free grammars\nin computational linguistics, our alternative dynamic programming algorithm\nscans the sequence in a left-to-right (5'-to-3') direction rather than in a\nbottom-up fashion, which allows us to employ the effective beam pruning\nheuristic. Our work, though inexact, is the first RNA folding algorithm to\nachieve linear runtime (and linear space) without imposing constraints on the\noutput structure. Surprisingly, our approximate search results in even higher\noverall accuracy on a diverse database of sequences with known structures. More\ninterestingly, it leads to significantly more accurate predictions on the\nlongest sequence families in that database (16S and 23S Ribosomal RNAs), as\nwell as improved accuracies for long-range base pairs (500+ nucleotides apart),\nboth of which are well known to be challenging for the current models.\n  Availability: Our source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/LinearFold/LinearFold, and our webserver is at\nhttp://linearfold.org (sequence limit: 100,000nt).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 00:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-14"}
