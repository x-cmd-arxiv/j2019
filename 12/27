In this study, we observe that apart from the need for robust node\nclassification strategy and higher order boundary formulations, the direction\nin which the reconstruction procedures are performed plays an important role in\nhandling sharp edges. Taking this into account we present a versatile interface\ntracking procedure based on ray tracing algorithm and a novel three step\nsolution reconstruction procedure that computes pseudo-normals in the regions\nwhere the normal is not well-defined and reconstructs the flow field along\nthose directions. We demonstrate that this procedure enables solver to\nefficiently handle and accurately represent sharp-edged regions.

These modes can be parameterized effectively in terms of Q-Hermite\northogonal polynomials, the main contribution being the scale fluctuations for\nwhich we give a simple estimate.

The\ndefinition of atomic set is very broad; popular examples include the standard\nbasis, low-rank matrices, overcomplete dictionaries, permutation matrices,\northogonal matrices, etc. The model of sparse atomic optimization therefore\nincludes problems coming from many fields, including statistics, signal\nprocessing, machine learning, computer vision and so on. Specifically, we\nconsider the problem of maximizing a restricted strongly convex (or concave),\nsmooth function restricted to a sparse linear combination of atoms. We extend\nrecent work that establish linear convergence rates of greedy algorithms on\nrestricted strongly concave, smooth functions on sparse vectors to the realm of\ngeneral atomic sets, where the convergence rate involves a novel quantity: the\n\"sparse atomic condition number\". This leads to the strongest known\nmultiplicative approximation guarantees for various flavors of greedy\nalgorithms for sparse atomic optimization; in particular, we show that in many\nsettings of interest the greedy algorithm can attain strong approximation\nguarantees while maintaining sparsity.

In this\nwork, we propose to extract curve skeletons, from unorganized point clouds, by\ndecomposing the object into its parts, identifying part skeletons and then\nlinking these part skeletons together to obtain the complete skeleton. We\nbelieve it is the most natural way to extract skeletons in the sense that this\nwould be the way a human would approach the problem. Our parts are generalized\ncylinders (GCs). Since, the axis of a GC is an integral part of its definition,\nthe parts have natural skeletal representations. We use translational symmetry,\nthe fundamental property of GCs, to extract parts from point clouds. We\ndemonstrate how this method can handle a large variety of shapes.

Emerging Clouds rely on the tenants to provide the resource\nspecification for their database workloads. However, they tend to over-estimate\nthe resource requirement of their databases, resulting in the unnecessarily\nhigh cost and low Cloud utilization. A methodology that automatically suggests\nthe \"just-enough\" resource specification that fulfills the performance\nrequirement of every database workload is profitable. To this end, we propose\nURSA, a capacity planning and workload scheduling system for dbPaaS Clouds.\nUSRA is comprised by an online capacity planner, a performance interference\nestimator, and a contention-aware scheduling engine. The capacity planner\nidentifies the most cost-efficient resource specification for a database\nworkload to achieve the required performance online. The interference estimator\nquantifies the pressure on the shared resource and the sensitivity to the\nshared resource contention of each database workload. The scheduling engine\nschedules the workloads across Cloud nodes carefully to eliminate unfair\nperformance interference between the co-located workloads. Our real system\nexperimental results show that URSA reduces 27.5% of CPU usage and 53.4% of\nmemory usage for database workloads while satisfying their performance\nrequirements. Meanwhile, URSA reduces the performance unfairness between the\nco-located workloads by 42.8% compared with the Kubernetes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 02:39:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-30"}

Determination of each cellular state, along with the\nratio of each cell type, as well as the developmental course during cell\ndifferentiation are highly regulated processes that are robust to noise and\nenvironmental perturbations throughout development. Waddington metaphorically\ndepicted this robustness as the epigenetic landscape in which the robustness of\neach cellular state is represented by each valley in the landscape. This\nrobustness is now conceptualized as an approach toward an attractor in a\ngene-expression dynamical system. However, there is still an incomplete\nunderstanding of the origin of landscape change, which is accompanied by\nbranching of valleys that corresponds to the differentiation process. Recent\nprogress in developmental biology has unveiled the molecular processes involved\nin epigenetic modification, which will be a key to understanding the nature of\nslow landscape change. Nevertheless, the contribution of the interplay between\ngene expression and epigenetic modification to robust landscape changes, known\nas homeorhesis, remains elusive. Here, we introduce a theoretical model that\ncombines epigenetic modification with gene expression dynamics driven by a\nregulatory network. In this model, epigenetic modification changes the\nfeasibility of expression, i.e., the threshold for expression dynamics, and a\nslow positive-feedback process from expression to the threshold level is\nintroduced. Under such epigenetic feedback, several fixed-point attractors with\ndistinct expression patterns are generated hierarchically shaping the\nepigenetic landscape with successive branching of valleys. This theory provides\na quantitative framework for explaining homeorhesis in development as\npostulated by Waddington, based on dynamical-system theory with slow feedback\nreinforcement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 05:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

The underlying assumption is that those tasks\ncould be modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Here, we investigate the\nfeasibility of this assumption by exploring its consequences for two\nfundamental tasks in quantum programming: state preparation and gate\ncompilation. By forming discrete MDPs, focusing exclusively on the single-qubit\ncase (both with and without noise), we solve for the optimal policy exactly\nthrough policy iteration. We find optimal paths that correspond to the shortest\npossible sequence of gates to prepare a state, or compile a gate, up to some\ntarget accuracy.

Accordingly, the model can explore the long-range dependency of\nfeatures from the top layers. However, a potential limitation of the network is\nthat the discriminative features from the bottom layers (which can model the\nshort-range dependency) are smoothed out in the final representation. This\nlimitation is especially evident in the acoustic event classification (AEC)\ntask, where both short- and long-duration events are involved in an audio clip\nand needed to be classified. In this paper, we propose a cross-scale attention\n(CSA) model, which explicitly integrates features from different scales to form\nthe final representation.

This property can be used to quantify precisely the\neffect of interfacial dilatational elasticity on the various rheological\nproperties of bulk emulsions. Experiments We measured the interfacial\ndilatational elasticity of adsorption layers from four saponins (Quillaja,\nEscin, Berry, Tea) adsorbed on hexadecane-water and sunflower oil-water\ninterfaces. In parallel, the rheological properties under steady and\noscillatory shear deformations were measured for bulk emulsions, stabilized by\nthe same saponins (oil volume fraction between 75 and 85 %). Findings Quillaja\nsaponin and Berry saponin formed solid adsorption layers (shells) on the\nSFO-water interface. As a consequence, the respective emulsions contained\nnon-spherical drops. For the other systems, the interfacial elasticities varied\nbetween 2 mN/m and 500 mN/m.

The recurrent neural networks (RNNs), e.g., long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) model, are able to capture the long-term temporal\ndependencies, but come with the issues of the high latency and the complexity\nof training.To address these issues, the temporal convolutional network (TCN)\nwas proposed to replace the RNNs in various sequence modeling tasks. In this\npaper we propose a novel TCN model that employs multi-branch structure, called\nmulti-branch TCN (MB-TCN), for monaural speech enhancement.The MB-TCN exploits\nsplit-transform-aggregate design, which is expected to obtain strong\nrepresentational power at a low computational complexity.Inspired by the TCN,\nthe MB-TCN model incorporates one dimensional causal dilated CNN and residual\nlearning to expand receptive fields for capturing long-term temporal contextual\ninformation.Our extensive experimental investigation suggests that the MB-TCNs\noutperform the residual long short-term memory networks (ResLSTMs), temporal\nconvolutional networks (TCNs), and the CNN networks that employ dense\naggregations in terms of speech intelligibility and quality, while providing\nsuperior parameter efficiency.

The primary purpose of static TDMA-scheduling\nalgorithms is to improve the channel utilization by generating a schedule of\nshorter length. But, they usually take a longer time to schedule, and hence,\nare not suitable for WSNs, in which the network topology changes dynamically.\nOn the other hand, dynamic TDMA-scheduling algorithms generate a schedule\nquickly, but they are not efficient in terms of generated schedule length. In\nthis paper, we propose a new approach to TDMA scheduling for WSNs, that bridges\nthe gap between the above two extreme types of TDMA-scheduling techniques, by\nproviding the flexibility to trade-off between the schedule length and the time\nrequired to generate the schedule (scheduling time).

In the first phase, we generate a TDMA schedule\nquickly, which need not have to be very efficient in terms of schedule length.\nIn the second phase, we iteratively reduce the schedule length in a manner,\nsuch that the process of schedule length reduction can be terminated after the\nexecution of an arbitrary number of iterations, and still be left with a valid\nschedule. This step provides the capability to trade-off between schedule\nlength and scheduling time. We have used Castalia network simulator to evaluate\nthe performance of proposed TDMA-scheduling scheme. The simulation result\ntogether with theoretical analysis shows that in addition to the advantage of\ntrading-off the schedule length with scheduling time, the proposed TDMA\nscheduling approach achieves better performance than existing algorithms in\nterms of schedule length and scheduling time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 09:38:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-30"}

First, for the viability\nof the rule it plays a crucial role that these two equations together uniquely\ndefine the time evolution of $\\psi$; we point out here how the Hille-Yosida\ntheorem implies that the time evolution is well defined and given by a\ncontraction semigroup. Second, we show that the collapse required for the\n$N$-particle version of the problem is well defined. Finally, we also prove\nanalogous results for the Dirac equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 10:53:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 11:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-01"}

Results confirm that\nthe Efficient Coding Hypothesis holds for current color vision models, and\nidentify the psychophysical mechanisms critically responsible for gains in\ninformation transference: opponent channels and their nonlinear nature are more\nimportant than chromatic adaptation at the retina.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 13:41:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 21:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-13"}

This work intends to take a further\nstep in this direction by building compliance classifiers with CPAP therapy at\nthree different moments of the patient follow-up (i.e. before the therapy\nstarts and at months 1 and 3 after the baseline). Results of the clinical trial\nconfirmed that month 3 was the time-point with the most accurate classifier\nreaching an f1-score of 87% and 84% in cross-validation and test.

At\nbaseline, where no information about patients' CPAP use was given yet, the best\nclassifier achieved 73% and 76% of f1-score in cross-validation and test set\nrespectively. Subsequent analyses carried out with the best classifiers of each\ntime point revealed that certain baseline factors (i.e. headaches,\npsychological symptoms, arterial hypertension and EuroQol visual analogue\nscale) were closely related to the prediction of compliance independently of\nthe time-point. In addition, among the variables taken only during the\nfollow-up of the patients, Epworth and the average nighttime hours were the\nmost important to predict compliance with CPAP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 14:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-30"}

These\ninequalities have been exploited in more general environments, many of which\nadmit primal-dual approximation algorithms.\n  Inspired by problems from power and transport systems, we introduce a new\ngeneral setting in which items can be taken fractionally to cover a given\ndemand. The cost incurred by an item is given by an arbitrary non-decreasing\nfunction of the chosen fraction. We generalize the knapsack-cover inequalities\nto this setting an use them to obtain a $(2+\\varepsilon)$-approximate\nprimal-dual algorithm. Our procedure has a natural interpretation as a\nbucket-filling algorithm, which effectively balances the difficulties given by\nhaving different slopes in the cost functions: when some superior portion of an\nitem presents a low slope, it helps to increase the priority with which the\ninferior portions may be taken.

In addition,\nit does not need data to be exported to third parties, preserving privacy.\nDespite these benefits, a main limit of existing approaches is the centralized\noptimization which relies on a server for aggregation and fusion of local\nparameters; this has the drawback of a single point of failure and scaling\nissues for increasing network size. The paper proposes a fully distributed (or\nserver-less) learning approach: the proposed FL algorithms leverage the\ncooperation of devices that perform data operations inside the network by\niterating local computations and mutual interactions via consensus-based\nmethods. The approach lays the groundwork for integration of FL within 5G and\nbeyond networks characterized by decentralized connectivity and computing, with\nintelligence distributed over the end-devices. The proposed methodology is\nverified by experimental datasets collected inside an industrial IoT\nenvironment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 15:16:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

We have also conducted a set of\nnumerical experiments to uncover implications of various operational practices\nof LC Waikiki on its system's performance and important managerial insights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 05:57:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}

We use discrete retinal neuron blocks based on a\ncollation of single-compartment models and morphologically realistic\nformulations, and successfully achieve a biologically real-time simulator. This\nis done by optimizing the numerical methods employed to solve the system of\nover 270 nonlinear ordinary differential equations and parameters. Our\nsimulator includes some of the most recent advances in compartmental modeling\nto include five intrinsic ion currents of each cell whilst ensuring real-time\nperformance, in attaining the ion-current and membrane responses of the\nphotoreceptor rod and cone cells, the bipolar and amacrine cells, their\nlaterally connected electrical and chemical synapses, and the output ganglion\ncell. It exhibits dynamical retinal behavior such as spike-frequency\nadaptation, rebound activation, fast-spiking, and subthreshold responsivity.\nLight stimuli incident at the photoreceptor rod and cone cells is modulated\nthrough the system of differential equations, enabling the user to probe the\nneuronal response at any point in the network. This is in contrast to many\nother retina encoding schemes which prefer to `black-box' the preceding stages\nto the spike train output. Our simulator is made available open source, with\nthe hope that it will benefit neuroscientists and machine learning\npractitioners in better understanding the retina sub-circuitries, how retina\ncells optimize the representation of visual information, and in generating\nlarge datasets of biologically accurate graded and spiking responses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2019 20:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-16"}

A FRPN consists of a recursive layer, which,\ngiven a fixed input, iteratively computes an equilibrium state. The unfolding\nrealized with this kind of iterative mechanism allows to simulate a deep neural\nnetwork with any number of layers. The extension of the FRPN to CNN results in\nan architecture, which we call convolutional-FRPN (C-FRPN), where the\nconvolutional layers are recursive. The method is evaluated on several image\nclassification benchmarks. It is shown that the C-FRPN consistently outperforms\nstandard CNNs having the same number of parameters. The gap in performance is\nparticularly large for small networks, showing that the C-FRPN is a very\npowerful architecture, since it allows to obtain equivalent performance with\nfewer parameters when compared with deep CNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 12:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-17"}

Although deep learning has been widely used in the\nvision tasks of visible light images recently, it is rarely used in infrared\nsmall target detection due to the difficulty in learning small target features.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel lightweight convolutional neural network\nTBC-Net for infrared small target detection. The TBCNet consists of a target\nextraction module (TEM) and a semantic constraint module (SCM), which are used\nto extract small targets from infrared images and to classify the extracted\ntarget images during the training, respectively. Meanwhile, we propose a joint\nloss function and a training method. The SCM imposes a semantic constraint on\nTEM by combining the high-level classification task and solve the problem of\nthe difficulty to learn features caused by class imbalance problem. During the\ntraining, the targets are extracted from the input image and then be classified\nby SCM. During the inference, only the TEM is used to detect the small targets.\nWe also propose a data synthesis method to generate training data. The\nexperimental results show that compared with the traditional methods, TBC-Net\ncan better reduce the false alarm caused by complicated background, the\nproposed network structure and joint loss have a significant improvement on\nsmall target feature learning. Besides, TBC-Net can achieve real-time detection\non the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier development board, which is suitable for\napplications such as field research with drones equipped with infrared sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 05:25:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-17"}

G\\\"odel's numbering technique is universal for enumerable\nstructures and shows strong limits of the language technology. Computability\ntheory is a particular example: programs can be numbered and all sorts of\nlimits can be studied from there. Computability is also at the heart of science\nsince any experimental validation of a theory supposes that theoretical results\nhave been computed, then checked against concrete experiments. It implies that\nlimitations on what is computable ultimately are also limits of what we\nunderstand as \"scientific theory\", and more generally to all the transmissible\nknowledge. We argue that it is fruitful to look a epistemology from a\ncomputability perspective.
