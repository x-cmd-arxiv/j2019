Thus we demonstrate that scattering plays a double role\nin determining the optical transmission spectra -- increasing the total optical\ndepth of the medium and adding the diffused radiation due to scattering to the\ntransmitted stellar radiation. The resulting effects yield into an increase in\nthe transmitted flux and hence reduction in the transmission depth. For a\ncloudless planetary atmosphere, Rayleigh scattering albedo alters the\ntransmission depth up to about 0.6 micron but the change in the transmission\ndepth due to forward scattering by cloud or haze is significant throughout the\noptical and near-infrared regions.

Since an unknown number and\nnature of fault types can arise during deployment, data-driven fault\ndiagnostics in this scenario is an open-set learning problem. Most of the\nalgorithms for open-set diagnostics are one-class classification and\nunsupervised algorithms that do not leverage all the available labeled and\nunlabeled data in the learning algorithm. As a result, their fault detection\nand segmentation performance (i.e., identifying and separating faults of\ndifferent types) are sub-optimal. With this work, we propose training a\nvariational autoencoder (VAE) with labeled and unlabeled samples while inducing\nimplicit supervision on the latent representation of the healthy conditions.\nThis, together with a modified sampling process of VAE, creates a compact and\ninformative latent representation that allows good detection and segmentation\nof unseen fault types using existing one-class and clustering algorithms. We\nrefer to the proposed methodology as \"knowledge induced variational autoencoder\nwith adaptive sampling\" (KIL-AdaVAE). The fault detection and segmentation\ncapabilities of the proposed methodology are demonstrated in a new simulated\ncase study using the Advanced Geared Turbofan 30000 (AGTF30) dynamical model\nunder real flight conditions. In an extensive comparison, we demonstrate that\nthe proposed method outperforms other learning strategies (supervised learning,\nsupervised learning with embedding and semi-supervised learning) and deep\nlearning algorithms, yielding significant performance improvements on fault\ndetection and fault segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Dec 2019 18:40:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 19:23:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01"}

This wave nonlinearly deforms during its propagation\nin the ocean, what results in a steep wave front formation.

Via social media\nplatforms, fake news travel at unprecedented speeds, reach global audiences and\nput users and communities at great risk. Therefore, it is extremely important\nto detect fake news as early as possible. Recently, deep learning based\napproaches have shown improved performance in fake news detection. However, the\ntraining of such models requires a large amount of labeled data, but manual\nannotation is time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, due to the dynamic nature\nof news, annotated samples may become outdated quickly and cannot represent the\nnews articles on newly emerged events. Therefore, how to obtain fresh and\nhigh-quality labeled samples is the major challenge in employing deep learning\nmodels for fake news detection. In order to tackle this challenge, we propose a\nreinforced weakly-supervised fake news detection framework, i.e., WeFEND, which\ncan leverage users' reports as weak supervision to enlarge the amount of\ntraining data for fake news detection. The proposed framework consists of three\nmain components: the annotator, the reinforced selector and the fake news\ndetector. The annotator can automatically assign weak labels for unlabeled news\nbased on users' reports. The reinforced selector using reinforcement learning\ntechniques chooses high-quality samples from the weakly labeled data and\nfilters out those low-quality ones that may degrade the detector's prediction\nperformance. The fake news detector aims to identify fake news based on the\nnews content. We tested the proposed framework on a large collection of news\narticles published via WeChat official accounts and associated user reports.\nExtensive experiments on this dataset show that the proposed WeFEND model\nachieves the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Dec 2019 21:20:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2020 03:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

To overcome the hurdle of comparing methods with\ndifferent search spaces, we propose using a method's relative improvement over\nthe randomly sampled average architecture, which effectively removes advantages\narising from expertly engineered search spaces or training protocols.\nSurprisingly, we find that many NAS techniques struggle to significantly beat\nthe average architecture baseline.

The NSW is a well-established notion of fairness and efficiency,\ndefined as the weighted geometric mean of agents' valuations. For special cases\nof the problem with symmetric agents and additive(-like) valuation functions,\napproximation algorithms have been designed using approaches customized for\nthese specific settings, and they fail to extend to more general settings.\nHence, no approximation algorithm with factor independent of m is known either\nfor asymmetric agents with additive valuations or for symmetric agents beyond\nadditive(-like) valuations.\n  In this paper, we extend our understanding of the NSW problem to far more\ngeneral settings. Our main contribution is two approximation algorithms for\nasymmetric agents with additive and submodular valuations respectively. Both\nalgorithms are simple to understand and involve non-trivial modifications of a\ngreedy repeated matchings approach. Allocations of high valued items are done\nseparately by un-matching certain items and re-matching them, by processes that\nare different in both algorithms. We show that these approaches achieve\napproximation factors of O(n) and O(n log n) for additive and submodular case\nrespectively, which is independent of the number of items. For additive\nvaluations, our algorithm outputs an allocation that also achieves the fairness\nproperty of envy-free up to one item (EF1).\n  Furthermore, we show that the NSW problem under submodular valuations is\nstrictly harder than all currently known settings with an e/(e-1) factor of the\nhardness of approximation, even for constantly many agents. For this case, we\nprovide a different approximation algorithm that achieves a factor of e/(e-1),\nhence resolving it completely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Dec 2019 23:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

The two cases are the turbulent\nmixing of a jet in a co-flow at small Atwood number $A$, and the\nRayleigh-Taylor mixing in a tilted rocket rig at medium $A$. Uncertainty\nestimates are made for simulations using the BHR-1 turbulence model and\ncompared to reference data.

However, its hadronic\neigensolutions conform to a representation of superconformal algebra. and\nprovide a unified Regge spectroscopy of meson, baryon, and tetraquarks with a\nuniversal Regge slope. The pion $q \\bar q$ eigenstate is composite but yet has\nzero mass for $m_q=0.$ Light-Front Holography also predicts the form of the\nnonperturbative QCD running coupling in agreement with the effective charge\ndetermined from measurements of the Bjorken sum rule. One also obtains viable\npredictions for hadron dynamics such as spacelike and timelike hadronic form\nfactors, structure functions, distribution amplitudes, and transverse momentum\ndistributions. The combined approach of light-front holography and\nsuperconformal algebra also provides insight into the origin of the QCD mass\nscale and color confinement. A key tool is the dAFF principle which shows how a\nmass scale can appear in the Hamiltonian and the equations of motion while\nretaining the conformal symmetry of the action. When one applies the dAFF\nprocedure to chiral QCD, a mass scale $\\kappa$ appears which determines the\nhadron masses in the absence of the Higgs coupling. The result is an extended\nconformal symmetry which has a conformally invariant action even though an\nunderlying mass scale appears in the Hamiltonian. Although conformal symmetry\nis strongly broken by the heavy quark mass, the supersymmetric mechanism, which\ntransforms mesons to baryons (and baryons to tetraquarks), still holds and\ngives remarkable mass degeneracies across the spectrum of light, heavy-light\nand double-heavy hadrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Dec 2019 04:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In revisiting the role of gold, our\nstudy proposes new insights into the literature. First, our empirical design\nrelaxes the assumption of homogeneous investors in favour of agents with\ndifferent horizons. Second, we develop a new measure of correlation based on\nthe fractal approach, called the q-detrending moving average cross-correlation\ncoefficient. This allows us to measure the dependence for calm and extreme\nmovements. The proposed measure is both time-varying and time-scale varying,\ntaking into account the complex pattern of commodities and financial time\nseries (chaotic, non-stationary, etc.). Using intraday data from May 2017 to\nMarch 2019, including 35608 observations for each variable, our results are as\nfollows. First, we show a negative and significant average and tail dependence\nfor all time scales between gold and USD exchange rates that is consistent with\nthe gold's role as an effective hedge and safe-haven asset. Second, this study\nputs out average independence and positive and significant tail independence\nbetween gold and oil indicating that gold can be used by investors as a weak\nhedge but cannot be used as an effective safe-haven asset under exceptional\nmarket circumstances for all time scales.

Besides inference, low-bit training with\nquantized gradients can further bring more considerable acceleration, since the\nbackward process is often computation-intensive. Unfortunately, the\ninappropriate quantization of backward propagation usually makes the training\nunstable and even crash. There lacks a successful unified low-bit training\nframework that can support diverse networks on various tasks. In this paper, we\ngive an attempt to build a unified 8-bit (INT8) training framework for common\nconvolutional neural networks from the aspects of both accuracy and speed.\nFirst, we empirically find the four distinctive characteristics of gradients,\nwhich provide us insightful clues for gradient quantization.

Here we use microbending tests on notched\ncantilever beams FIB-milled from NiAl single crystals with an aluminized as\nwell as an oxidation-induced composition gradient to determine the influence of\nthe Al concentration on the mechanical properties. The fracture toughness is\nmaximal for the stoichiometric composition.

The differences in fracture toughness could\nfurthermore not be explained solely based on the different hardening\ncontributions of Ni-antisites in the Ni-rich and structural vacancies in the\nAl-rich crystals. Atomistic fracture simulations show that crack propagation in\nNiAl takes place by the nucleation and migration of kinks on the crack front.\nThe low fracture toughness of Al-rich NiAl can thus be understood by the dual\neffect of structural vacancies as strong obstacles to dislocation motion and as\nsource of crack front kinks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Dec 2019 08:39:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

In this paper,\nwe propose a variational inference method for imitation learning of a control\npolicy represented by parametrized hierarchical procedures (PHP), a\nprogram-like structure in which procedures can invoke sub-procedures to perform\nsub-tasks. Our method discovers the hierarchical structure in a dataset of\nobservation-action traces of teacher demonstrations, by learning an approximate\nposterior distribution over the latent sequence of procedure calls and\nterminations.

We identify and demonstrate a novel benefit of\nvariational inference in the context of hierarchical imitation learning: in\ndecomposing the policy into simpler procedures, inference can leverage acausal\ninformation that is unused by other methods.

In this paper, we show how\nmagnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices can be used to support QNN training. We\nintroduce a novel hardware synapse circuit that uses the MTJ stochastic\nbehavior to support the quantize update. The proposed circuit enables\nprocessing near memory (PNM) of QNN training, which subsequently reduces data\nmovement. We simulated MTJ-based stochastic training of a TNN over the MNIST,\nSVHN, and CIFAR10 datasets and achieved an accuracy of 98.61%, 93.99% and\n82.71%, respectively (less than 1% degradation compared to the GXNOR\nalgorithm). We evaluated the synapse array performance potential and showed\nthat the proposed synapse circuit can train ternary networks in situ, with\n18.3TOPs/W for feedforward and 3TOPs/W for weight update.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Dec 2019 11:36:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 May 2022 07:16:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-31"}

The\nGottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code is a promising approach towards fault-tolerant\nquantum computing, encoding logical qubits into grid states of harmonic\noscillators. However, for the code to be fault tolerant, the quality of the\ngrid states has to be extremely high. Approximate grid states have recently\nbeen realized experimentally, but their quality is still insufficient for fault\ntolerance. Current implementable protocols for generating grid states rely on\nmeasurements of ancillary qubits combined with either postselection or feed\nforward.

Network\nquantization addresses this problem effectively by leveraging low-bit\nrepresentation and arithmetic that could be conducted on dedicated embedded\nsystems. In the previous works, the parameter bitwidth is set homogeneously and\nthere is a trade-off between superior performance and aggressive compression.\nActually the stacked network layers, which are generally regarded as\nhierarchical feature extractors, contribute diversely to the overall\nperformance. For a well-trained neural network, the feature distributions of\ndifferent categories differentiate gradually as the network propagates forward.\nHence the capability requirement on the subsequent feature extractors is\nreduced. It indicates that the neurons in posterior layers could be assigned\nwith lower bitwidth for quantized neural networks. Based on this observation, a\nsimple but effective mixed-precision quantized neural network with\nprogressively ecreasing bitwidth is proposed to improve the trade-off between\naccuracy and compression. Extensive experiments on typical network\narchitectures and benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method could\nachieve better or comparable results while reducing the memory space for\nquantized parameters by more than 30\\% in comparison with the homogeneous\ncounterparts. In addition, the results also demonstrate that the\nhigher-precision bottom layers could boost the 1-bit network performance\nappreciably due to a better preservation of the original image information\nwhile the lower-precision posterior layers contribute to the regularization of\n$k-$bit networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Dec 2019 14:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

This paper focuses on the large scale capacitated arc\nrouting problem. Traditional solution optimization approaches usually fail\nbecause of their poor scalability. The divide-and-conquer strategy has achieved\ngreat success in solving large scale optimization problems by decomposing the\noriginal large problem into smaller sub-problems and solving them separately.\nFor arc routing, a commonly used divide-and-conquer strategy is to divide the\ntasks into subsets, and then solve the sub-problems induced by the task subsets\nseparately. However, the success of a divide-and-conquer strategy relies on a\nproper task division, which is non-trivial due to the complex interactions\nbetween the tasks. This paper proposes a novel problem decomposition operator,\nnamed the route cutting off operator, which considers the interactions between\nthe tasks in a sophisticated way. To examine the effectiveness of the route\ncutting off operator, we integrate it with two state-of-the-art\ndivide-and-conquer algorithms, and compared with the original counterparts on a\nwide range of benchmark instances. The results show that the route cutting off\noperator can improve the effectiveness of the decomposition, and lead to\nsignificantly better results especially when the problem size is very large and\nthe time budget is very tight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Dec 2019 14:52:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 10:30:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

The accuracy of\nthe prediction varies based on the factors, such as the stochastic nature of\nthe vehicle arrival rates, time of the day, weather and driver characteristics.\nIn addition, accurate prediction for multilane, undersaturated and saturated\ntraffic scenarios is challenging. Thus, the objective of this study is to\ndevelop queue length prediction models for signalized intersections that can be\nleveraged by ASCS using four variations of Grey systems: (i) the first order\nsingle variable Grey model (GM(1,1)); (ii) GM(1,1) with Fourier error\ncorrections; (iii) the Grey Verhulst model (GVM), and (iv) GVM with Fourier\nerror corrections.

The findings corroborate\nwith our proposed model of ACC formation via spinodal decomposition and provide\na more realistic representation of how biology can direct mineralization\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Dec 2019 14:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-20"}

Reflectance is the main considered parameter for performance\nanalysis. A theoretical framework based on Fresnel's equations is presented and\nby measuring reflectance versus angle of incidence, sensitivity is calculated\nfrom the displacement of SPR angle using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)\ntechnique. Our numerical analysis shows that using the proposed approach, about\n4.2 times enhanced sensitivity can be achieved compared to the basic\nKretschmann configuration. Notably, the structure provides an enhancement for\nboth angular and wavelength interrogations. Furthermore, simulations have been\nrepeated for various ligate-ligand pairs and consistent enhancement has been\nobserved which proves the robustness of the structure.
