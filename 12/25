Previous\nbiological studies have also proven that giant panda sounds are correlated with\nmating results and reproduction. This paper makes the first attempt to devise\nan automatic method for predicting mating success of giant pandas based on\ntheir vocal sounds. Given an audio sequence of mating giant pandas recorded\nduring breeding encounters, we first crop out the segments with vocal sound of\ngiant pandas, and normalize its magnitude, and length. We then extract acoustic\nfeatures from the audio segment and feed the features into a deep neural\nnetwork, which classifies the mating into success or failure. The proposed deep\nneural network employs convolution layers followed by bidirection gated\nrecurrent units to extract vocal features, and applies attention mechanism to\nforce the network to focus on most relevant features. Evaluation experiments on\na data set collected during the past nine years obtain promising results,\nproving the potential of audio-based automatic mating success prediction\nmethods in assisting giant panda reproduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2019 16:08:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 09:42:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 06:30:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-04"}

The distribution model is\nderived based on recent \\textit{ab initio} calculations, carried out using\npotential energy surfaces developed using accurate computational quantum\nchemistry techniques for the purpose of studying air chemistry at high\ntemperatures. Immediately behind a strong shock wave, the vibrational energy\ndistribution is non-Boltzmann. Specifically, as the gas internal energy rapidly\nexcites to a high temperature, overpopulation of the high-energy tail (relative\nto a corresponding Boltzmann distribution) is observed in \\textit{ab initio}\nsimulations. As the gas excites further and begins to dissociate, a depletion\nof the high-energy tail is observed, during a time-invariant quasi-steady state\n(QSS). Since the probability of dissociation is exponentially related to the\nvibrational energy of the dissociating molecule, the overall dissociation rate\nis sensitive to the populations of these high vibrational energy states. The\nnon-Boltzmann effects captured by the new model either enhance or reduce the\ndissociation rate relative to that obtained assuming a Boltzmann distribution.\nThis article proposes a simple model that is demonstrated to reproduce these\nnon-Boltzmann effects quantitatively when compared to \\textit{ab initio}\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2019 16:31:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

We\nbegin with an elastic, extensible chain which is stretched out by the flow, up\nto inertial-range scales. This filamentary object, which is known to\npreferentially sample the circular coherent vortices of two-dimensional (2D)\nturbulence, is shown here to also preferentially sample the intense, tubular,\nvortex filaments of 3D turbulence. In the 2D case, the chain collapses into a\ntracer inside vortices. In 3D, on the contrary, the chain is extended even in\nvortical regions, which suggests that it follows axially-stretched tubular\nvortices by aligning with their axes. This physical picture is confirmed by\nexamining the relative sampling behaviour of the individual beads, and by\nadditional studies on an inextensible chain with adjustable bending-stiffness.\nA highly-flexible, inextensible chain also shows preferential sampling in 3D,\nprovided it is longer than the dissipation scale, but not much longer than the\nvortex tubes. This is true also for 2D turbulence, where a long inextensible\nchain can occupy vortices by coiling into them. When the chain is made\ninflexible, however, coiling is prevented and the extent of preferential\nsampling in 2D is considerably reduced. In 3D, on the contrary, bending\nstiffness has no effect, because the chain does not need to coil in order to\nthread a vortex tube and align with its axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2019 16:34:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 11:24:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-26"}

Whereas nonlinear (or shock-capturing)\nstabilization leads to improved accuracy compared to linear schemes, it also\nnegatively hinders nonlinear convergence, increasing computational cost. We\ncompare linear and nonlinear schemes in terms of the required computational\ntime versus accuracy for several steady benchmark problems. Numerical results\nindicate that, in general, nonlinear schemes can be cost-effective for\nsufficiently refined meshes. Besides, it is also observed that it is better to\nrefine further around shocks rather than use sharper shock capturing terms,\nwhich usually yield stiffer nonlinear problems. In addition, a new refinement\ncriterion has been proposed. The proposed criterion is based on the graph\nLaplacian used in the definition of the stabilization method. Numerical results\nshow that this shock detector performs better than the well-known Kelly\nestimator for problems with shocks or discontinuities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2019 16:01:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 10:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

At the\nheart of this compact compression scheme lies a VC-dimension type argument on\nplanar graphs.

Due to safety concerns, most existing studies prohibit lane\nchange since this may cause lateral collisions when coordination is not\nappropriately performed. However, in many traffic scenarios (e.g., work zones),\nvehicles must change lanes. To solve this problem, we categorize the potential\ncollision into two kinds and thus establish a bi-level planning problem. The\nright-of-way of vehicles for the critical conflict zone is considered in the\nupper-level, and the right-of-way of vehicles during lane changes is then\nresolved in the lower-level. The solutions of the upper-level problem are\nrepresented in tree space, and a near-optimal solution is searched for by\ncombining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with some heuristic rules within a\nvery short planning time. The proposed strategy is suitable for not only the\nshortest delay objective but also other objectives (e.g., energy-saving and\npassenger comfort).

To\ndevelop further insight, we revisit some of the key studies using a triple\ndecomposition of the velocity-gradient tensor. The additive triple\ndecomposition formally segregates the contributions of normal-strain-rate\n($N_{ij}$), pure-shear ($H_{ij}$) and rigid-body-rotation-rate ($R_{ij}$). The\ndecomposition not only highlights the key role of shear, but it also provides a\nmore accurate account of the influence of normal-strain and pure rotation on\nimportant small-scale features. First, the local streamline topology and\ngeometry are described in terms of the three constituent tensors in\nvelocity-gradient invariants' space. Using DNS data sets of forced isotropic\nturbulence, the velocity-gradient and pressure field fluctuations are examined\nat different Reynolds numbers. At all Reynolds numbers, shear contributes the\nmost and rigid-body-rotation the least toward the velocity-gradient magnitude\n($A^2$). Especially, shear contribution is dominant in regions of intermittency\n(high values of $A^2$). It is also shown that the high-degree of enstrophy\nintermittency reported in literature is due to the shear contribution toward\nvorticity rather than that of rigid-body-rotation. The study also provides an\nexplanation for the absence of intermittency of the pressure-Laplacian, despite\nthe strong intermittency of enstrophy and dissipation fields. Overall, it is\ndemonstrated that triple decomposition offers unique and deeper understanding\nof velocity-gradient behavior in turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2019 19:45:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

In this work, we provide a\ntheoretical analysis of the expressiveness of fully-connected, feedforward DNNs\nwith 1-Lipschitz activation functions. In particular, we characterize the\nexpressiveness of a DNN by its Lipchitz constant. By leveraging random matrix\ntheory, we show that, given sufficiently large and randomly distributed\nweights, the expected upper and lower bounds of the Lipschitz constant of a DNN\nand hence their expressiveness increase exponentially with depth and\npolynomially with width, which gives rise to the benefit of the depth of DNN\narchitectures for efficient function approximation. This observation is\nconsistent with established results based on alternative expressiveness\nmeasures of DNNs. In contrast to most of the existing work, our analysis based\non the Lipschitz properties of DNNs is applicable to a wider range of\nactivation nonlinearities and potentially allows us to make sensible\ncomparisons between the complexity of a DNN and the function to be approximated\nby the DNN.

Designing new glasses requires a priori knowledge of how the\ncomposition of a glass dictates its properties such as stiffness, density, or\nprocessability. Thus, accelerated design of glasses for targeted applications\nremain impeded due to the lack of universal composition-property models.\nHerein, using deep learning, we present a methodology for the rational design\nof oxide glasses.

It is known that, even for linear\nsemi-negative problems, many explicit Runge--Kutta (RK) methods fail to\npreserve this property. In this paper, we enforce strong stability by modifying\nthe method with superviscosity, which is a numerical technique commonly used in\nspectral methods. We propose two approaches, the modified method and the\nfiltering method for stabilization. The modified method is achieved by\nmodifying the semi-negative operator with a high order superviscosity term; the\nfiltering method is to post-process the solution by solving a diffusive or\ndispersive problem with small superviscosity. For linear problems, most\nexplicit RK methods can be stabilized with either approach without accuracy\ndegeneration. Furthermore, we prove a sharp bound (up to an equal sign) on\ndiffusive superviscosity for ensuring strong stability. The bound we derived\nfor general dispersive-diffusive superviscosity is also verified to be sharp\nnumerically. For nonlinear problems, a filtering method is investigated for\nstabilization. Numerical examples with linear non-normal ordinary differential\nequation systems and for discontinuous Galerkin approximation of conservation\nlaws are performed to validate our analysis and to test the performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Dec 2019 05:31:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-30"}

In this\narticle, we put forward the substantial challenges in cyber resilience in a few\nrepresentative application domains and outline foundational solutions to\naddress these challenges. These solutions fall into two broad themes:\nresilience-by-design and resilience-by-reaction. We use examples of autonomous\nsystems as the application drivers motivating cyber resilience. We focus on\nsome autonomous systems in the near horizon (autonomous ground and aerial\nvehicles) and also a little more distant (autonomous rescue and relief).\n  For resilience-by-design, we focus on design methods in software that are\nneeded for our cyber systems to be resilient. In contrast, for\nresilience-by-reaction, we discuss how to make systems resilient by responding,\nreconfiguring, or recovering at runtime when failures happen. We also discuss\nthe notion of adaptive execution to improve resilience, execution transparently\nand adaptively among available execution platforms (mobile/embedded, edge, and\ncloud). For each of the two themes, we survey the current state, and the\ndesired state and ways to get there.

We first place our approach in its\nhistorical context and describe the manner in which it synthesizes concepts\nfrom quantum chemistry, biology of polymer conformations, matrix mathematics,\nand percolation theory. We then explicitly provide the method for constructing\nthe protein structure network in terms of non-covalently interacting amino acid\nside chains and show how a mine of information can be obtained from the graph\nspectra of these networks. Employing suitable mathematical approaches, such as\nthe use of a weighted, Laplacian matrix to generate the spectra, enables us to\ndevelop rigorous methods for network comparison and to identify crucial nodes\nresponsible for the network integrity through a perturbation approach. Our\nscoring methods have several applications in structural biology that are\nelusive to conventional methods of analyses. Here, we discuss the instances of:\n(a) Protein structure comparison that include the details of side chain\nconnectivity, (b) The contribution to node clustering as a function of bound\nligand, explaining the global effect of local changes in phenomena such as\nallostery and (c) The identification of crucial amino acids for structural\nintegrity, derived purely from the spectra of the graph. We demonstrate how our\nmethod enables us to obtain valuable information on key proteins involved in\ncellular functions and diseases such as GPCR and HIV protease, and discuss the\nbiological implications. We then briefly describe how concepts from percolation\ntheory further augment our analyses. In our concluding perspective for future\ndevelopments, we suggest a further unifying approach to protein structure\nanalyses and a judicious choice of questions to employ our methods for larger,\nmore complex networks, such as metabolic and disease networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Dec 2019 06:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-30"}

While in\nsituations where two domains are asymmetric in complexity, i.e., the amount of\ninformation between two domains is different, these approaches pose problems of\npoor generation quality, mapping ambiguity, and model sensitivity. To address\nthese issues, we propose Asymmetric GAN (AsymGAN) to adapt the asymmetric\ndomains by introducing an auxiliary variable (aux) to learn the extra\ninformation for transferring from the information-poor domain to the\ninformation-rich domain, which improves the performance of state-of-the-art\napproaches in the following ways. First, aux better balances the information\nbetween two domains which benefits the quality of generation. Second, the\nimbalance of information commonly leads to mapping ambiguity, where we are able\nto model one-to-many mappings by tuning aux, and furthermore, our aux is\ncontrollable. Third, the training of Cycle GAN can easily make the generator\npair sensitive to small disturbances and variations while our model decouples\nthe ill-conditioned relevance of generators by injecting aux during training.\nWe verify the effectiveness of our proposed method both qualitatively and\nquantitatively on asymmetric situation, label-photo task, on Cityscapes and\nHelen datasets, and show many applications of asymmetric image translations.

Nonetheless, channel estimation and low-cost beamforming turn\nout to be two main obstacles to realizing this combination, due to the\npassivity of IRS for sending/receiving pilot signals and the large-scale use of\nexpensive RF chains in massive MIMO.

Each agent is represented by a spin having a\nnumber of discrete states $q$ or continuous states, describing the tendency of\nthe agent for buying or selling. The market ambiance is represented by a\nparameter $T$ which plays the role of the temperature in physics. We show that\nthere is a critical value of $T$, say $T_c$, where strong fluctuations between\nindividual states lead to a disordered situation in which there is no majority:\nthe numbers of sellers and buyers are equal, namely the market clearing.

Thus, the traditional utility mining framework is inadequate for\nobtaining up-to-date insights about real world data. In this paper, we address\nthis issue by introducing a novel framework, named utility-driven mining of\nRecent/trend high-Utility Patterns (RUP) in temporal databases for intelligent\nsystems, based on user-specified minimum recency and minimum utility\nthresholds. The utility-driven RUP algorithm is based on novel global and\nconditional downward closure properties, and a recency-utility tree. Moreover,\nit adopts a vertical compact recency-utility list structure to store the\ninformation required by the mining process. The developed RUP algorithm\nrecursively discovers recent HUPs. It is also fast and consumes a small amount\nof memory due to its pattern discovery approach that does not generate\ncandidates. Two improved versions of the algorithm with additional pruning\nstrategies are also designed to speed up the discovery of patterns by reducing\nthe search space.

For one type of cosmic horizon, associated with universes\nthat keep expanding forever, there is a simple intuitive picture of where the\ncosmic horizon is located, in terms of the relative speed between a distant\ngalaxy and our own approaching the speed of light: Where the light-speed limit\nis reached, light signals from that distant galaxy will not be able to catch up\nwith our own galaxy; that galaxy and more distant galaxies are behind the\ncosmic horizon. Applied to the usual recession speeds of galaxies, that simple\npicture turns out to be wrong. But there is another relevant concept of speed,\nderived from the relativistic relative velocity of galaxies, which in turn is\ndefined via the parallel transport of four-velocities. This article shows how,\nusing this concept of relative velocity, key elements of the intuitive picture\nare valid, and can be used in a simplified explanation for cosmic horizons.\nWhen phrased as a statement about relative radial velocities, the notion of\nlight not being able to catch up with our own galaxy is consistent with the\ncalculations, and the cosmic event horizon is indeed the limit where the\nrelative radial velocity of distant Hubble-flow galaxies reaches the speed of\nlight.

By introducing the metal substrate, the perfect electric\nconductor (PEC) surface effect can be formed to not only enhance the electric\nfield in silicon, but also improve the near-field distribution. Meanwhile, in\nconsideration of the periodic nanostructure, the silicon nanodisk, acting as a\nhigh-refractive-index dielectric grating, can generate a propagating surface\nplasmon resonance (PSPR) on the metal surface. By flexibly manipulating the\narray period, PSPR can effectively couple with EDR, which produces further\nenhancement and novel properties for EDR. On account of the dual enhancements\nfrom these two effects, it is demonstrated that the total THG conversion\nefficiency of the proposed nanostructure is raised by more than eight orders of\nmagnitude as compared with that of the all-dielectric nanostructure. In\naddition, the influence of silicon Kerr effect on the coupling and THG is\ninvestigated as well, manifesting an unprecedent THG efficiency around 10^-2\nwith input internsity 2 GW/cm^2.

Especially in neuroscience, PSTPM\nis widely used for deep-tissue imaging in the brain. However, due to sequential\nscanning, PSTPM is slow. Temporal focusing microscopy (TFM), on the other hand,\nfocuses femtosecond pulsed laser light temporally, while keeping wide-field\nillumination, and is consequently much faster. However, due to the use of a\ncamera detector, TFM suffers from the scattering of emission photons. As a\nresult, TFM produces images of poor spatial resolution and signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR), burying fluorescent signals from small structures such as\ndendritic spines. In this work, we present a data-driven deep learning approach\nto improve resolution and SNR of TFM images. Using a 3D convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) we build a map from TFM to PSTPM modalities, to enable fast TFM\nimaging while maintaining high-resolution through scattering media. We\ndemonstrate this approach for in vivo imaging of dendritic spines on pyramidal\nneurons in the mouse visual cortex.

For example, we can reliably tell\nwhich objects occlude others, what an object is made of and its rough shape,\nregions that are illuminated or in shadow, and so on. It is interesting how\nlittle is known about our ability to make these determinations; as such, we are\nstill not able to robustly \"teach\" computers to make the same high-level\nobservations as people. This document presents algorithms for understanding\nintrinsic scene properties from single images. The goal of these inverse\nrendering techniques is to estimate the configurations of scene elements\n(geometry, materials, luminaires, camera parameters, etc) using only\ninformation visible in an image. Such algorithms have applications in robotics\nand computer graphics. One such application is in physically grounded image\nediting: photo editing made easier by leveraging knowledge of the physical\nspace. These applications allow sophisticated editing operations to be\nperformed in a matter of seconds, enabling seamless addition, removal, or\nrelocation of objects in images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Dec 2019 04:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

Operating at high frame\nrates, SPAD imagers typically generate large volumes of noisy and largely\nredundant spatio-temporal data. This results in communication bottlenecks and\nunnecessary data processing. In this work, we propose a set of neuromorphic\nprocessing solutions to this problem. By processing the SPAD generated\nspatio-temporal patterns locally and in an event-based manner, the proposed\nmethods reduce the size of output data transmitted from the sensor by orders of\nmagnitude while increasing the utility of the output data in the context of\nchallenging recognition tasks. To demonstrate these results, the first large\nscale complex SPAD imaging dataset is presented involving high-speed\nview-invariant recognition of airplanes with background clutter. The\nframe-based SPAD imaging dataset is converted via several alternative methods\ninto event-based data streams and processed using a range of feature extractor\nnetworks and pooling methods. The results of the event-based processing methods\nare compared to processing the original frame-based dataset via frame-based but\notherwise identical architectures. The results show the event-based methods are\nsuperior to the frame-based approach both in terms of classification accuracy\nand output data-rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Dec 2019 11:57:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}
