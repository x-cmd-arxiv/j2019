Various constructions of monotones appear in many\ndifferent concrete resource theories. How general are these constructions? What\nare the necessary conditions on a resource theory for a given construction to\nbe applicable? To answer these questions, we introduce a broad scheme for\nconstructing monotones. It involves finding an order-preserving map from the\npreorder of resources of interest to a distinct preorder for which nontrivial\nmonotones are previously known or can be more easily constructed; these\nmonotones are then pulled back through the map. In one of the two main classes\nwe study, the preorder of resources is mapped to a preorder of sets of\nresources, where the order relation is set inclusion, such that monotones can\nbe defined via maximizing or minimizing the value of a function within these\nsets. In the other class, the preorder of resources is mapped to a preorder of\ntuples of resources, and one pulls back monotones that measure the amount of\ndistinguishability of the different elements of the tuple (hence its\ninformation content). Monotones based on contractions arise naturally in the\nlatter class, and, more surprisingly, so do weight and robustness measures. In\naddition to capturing many standard monotone constructions, our scheme also\nsuggests significant generalizations of these. In order to properly capture the\nbreadth of applicability of our results, we present them within a novel\nabstract framework for resource theories in which the notion of composition is\nindependent of the types of the resources involved (i.e., whether they are\nstates, channels, combs, etc.).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Dec 2019 18:38:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 10:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

RoAR training is based on the biophysical\nmodel and does not require ground-truth R2* maps. Since RoAR utilizes signal\ninformation not just from individual voxels but also accounts for spatial\npatterns of the signals in the images, it reduces the sensitivity of R2* maps\nto the noise in the data.

In the instability analysis we take into account the detailed\ndownstream evolution of the basic flow behind the body base. The study confirms\nthe existence of a finite region of absolute instability for the first\nazimuthal number in the near field of the wake. Such instability is believed to\ntrigger the large scale helical vortex shedding downstream of the recirculating\nzone. Inhibition of vortex shedding is examined by blowing a given flow rate of\nfluid through the base of the slender body. The extent of the locally absolute\nregion of the flow is calculated as a function of the bleed coefficient,\n$C_b=q_b/(\\pi R^2u_\\infty)$, where $q_b$ is the bleed flow rate, $R$ is the\nradius of the base and $u_\\infty$ is the incident free-stream velocity.

In addition, we report\nexperimental results of flow visualizations and hot-wire measurements for\nincreasing values of the bleed coefficient. When a sufficient amount of base\nbleed is applied, flow visualizations indicate that vortex shedding is\nsuppressed and that the mean flow becomes axisymmetric.

However, finding generally applicable and\ncomputationally feasible methods for robust Bayesian inference under\nmisspecification has proven to be a difficult challenge. An intriguing,\neasy-to-use, and widely applicable approach is to use bagging on the Bayesian\nposterior (\"BayesBag\"); that is, to use the average of posterior distributions\nconditioned on bootstrapped datasets. In this paper, we develop the asymptotic\ntheory of BayesBag, propose a model-data mismatch index for model criticism\nusing BayesBag, and empirically validate our theory and methodology on\nsynthetic and real-world data in linear regression, sparse logistic regression,\nand a hierarchical mixed effects model. We find that in the presence of\nsignificant misspecification, BayesBag yields more reproducible inferences and\nhas better predictive accuracy than the standard Bayesian posterior; on the\nother hand, when the model is correctly specified, BayesBag produces superior\nor equally good results. Overall, our results demonstrate that BayesBag\ncombines the attractive modeling features of standard Bayesian inference with\nthe distributional robustness properties of frequentist methods, providing\nbenefits over both Bayes alone and the bootstrap alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Dec 2019 20:29:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 May 2020 20:11:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 00:48:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-31"}

In\nthat regime, the liquid surface is populated by small disorganised deformations\nelongated in the wind direction, referred to as wrinkles. These wrinkles are\nthe superposition of incoherent wakes generated by the pressure fluctuations\ntraveling in the turbulent boundary layer in the air. In this work, we account\nfor the effect of a weak sheared current in the liquid, either longitudinal or\ntransverse, by introducing a modified Doppler-shifted dispersion relation to\nlowest order in viscosity and current in the spectral theory previously derived\nby Perrard et al (2019). This theory describes the simplified one-way problem\nof surface deformations excited by a prescribed turbulent forcing, thereby\nneglecting the retroaction of waves on turbulence in the air. The forcing is\ntaken from a set of direct numerical simulations of a turbulent channel flow.\nWe determine the wrinkle properties (size and amplitude) as a function of the\nliquid viscosity and current properties (surface velocity, thickness and\norientation). We find significant modifications of the wrinkle geometry by the\ncurrents: the wrinkles are tilted for a transverse current, and show finer\nscales for a longitudinal current. However, their characteristic size is weakly\naffected, and their amplitude remains independent of the current. We discuss\nthe implications of these results on the onset of regular waves at larger wind\nvelocity. In this work, we introduce a spectral interpolation method to\nevaluate the surface deformation fields, based on a refined meshing close to\nthe dispersion relation of the waves. This method, which can be extended to any\ndispersive system excited by a random forcing, strongly reduces the\ndiscretization effects at a low computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Dec 2019 23:23:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2020 14:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

The large-scale pattern of distribution of genes on the\nchromosomes in the known animal genomes is not well characterized. We\nhypothesized that individual genes will be distributed on chromosomes in a\nmathematically ordered manner across the animal kingdom. Results. Twenty-one\nanimal genomes reported in the NCBI database were examined. Numerically, there\nwas a trend towards increasing overall gene content with increasing size of the\ngenome as reflected by the chromosomal complement. Gene frequency on individual\nchromosomes in each animal genome was analyzed and demonstrated uniformity of\nproportions within each animal with respect to both average gene frequency on\nindividual chromosomes and gene distribution across the unique genomes.\nFurther, average gene distribution across animal species followed a\nrelationship whereby it was, approximately, inversely proportional to the\nsquare root of the number of chromosomes in the unique animal genomes,\nconsistent with the notion that there is an ordered increase in gene dispersion\nas the complexity of the genome increased. To further corroborate these\nfindings a derived measure, termed gene spacing on chromosomes correlated with\ngene frequency and gene distribution. Conclusion. As animal species have\nevolved, the distribution of their genes on individual chromosomes and within\ntheir genomes, when viewed on a large scale is not random, but follows a\nmathematically ordered process, such that as the complexity of the organism\nincreases, the genes become less densely distributed on the chromosomes and\nmore dispersed across the genome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 01:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

Due to the instantaneity and imperceptibility characteristics of\nintraday stock jumps, relevant studies on their predictability remain limited.\nThis paper proposes a data-driven approach to predict intraday stock jumps\nusing the information embedded in liquidity measures and technical indicators.\nSpecifically, a trading day is divided into a series of 5-minute intervals, and\nat the end of each interval, the candidate attributes defined by liquidity\nmeasures and technical indicators are input into machine learning algorithms to\npredict the arrival of a stock jump as well as its direction in the following\n5-minute interval. Empirical study is conducted on the level-2 high-frequency\ndata of 1271 stocks in the Shenzhen Stock Exchange of China to validate our\napproach. The result provides initial evidence of the predictability of jump\narrivals and jump directions using level-2 stock data as well as the\neffectiveness of using a combination of liquidity measures and technical\nindicators in this prediction. We also reveal the superiority of using random\nforest compared to other machine learning algorithms in building prediction\nmodels.

It is generally agreed that solar wind plasma velocity and magnetic\nfield fluctuations observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during the first\nencounter are mostly highly Alfv\\'enic. However, quantitative measures of\nAlfv\\'enicity are needed to understand how the characterization of these\nfluctuations compares with standard measures from prior missions in the inner\nand outer heliosphere, in fast wind and slow wind, and at high and low\nlatitudes. To investigate this issue, we employ several measures to quantify\nthe extent of Alfv\\'enicity -- the Alfv\\'en ratio $r_A$, {normalized} cross\nhelicity $\\sigma_c$, {normalized} residual energy $\\sigma_r$, and the cosine of\nangle between velocity and magnetic fluctuations $\\cos\\theta_{vb}$. We show\nthat despite the overall impression that the Alfv\\'enicity is large in the\nsolar wind sampled by PSP during the first encounter, during some intervals the\ncross helicity starts decreasing at very large scales. These length-scales\n(often $> 1000 d_i$) are well inside inertial range, and therefore, the\nsuppression of cross helicity at these scales cannot be attributed to kinetic\nphysics. This drop at large scales could potentially be explained by\nlarge-scale shears present in the inner heliosphere sampled by PSP. In some\ncases, despite the cross helicity being constant down to the noise floor, the\nresidual energy decreases with scale in the inertial range. These results\nsuggest that it is important to consider all these measures to quantify\nAlfv\\'enicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 03:59:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

To characterize the\nperformance of timely status update, we adopt a recent concept, Age of\nInformation (AoI), as the performance metric. We aim to minimize the long-term\naverage AoI under the limited average transmission power at the source, by\nformulating a constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) problem.

After the introduction of\nthe deep Q-network, deep RL has been achieving great success. However, the\napplications of deep reinforcement learning (RL) for image processing are still\nlimited. Therefore, we extend deep RL to pixelRL for various image processing\napplications. In pixelRL, each pixel has an agent, and the agent changes the\npixel value by taking an action. We also propose an effective learning method\nfor pixelRL that significantly improves the performance by considering not only\nthe future states of the own pixel but also those of the neighbor pixels. The\nproposed method can be applied to some image processing tasks that require\npixel-wise manipulations, where deep RL has never been applied.

Here we draw upon\nrecent advances in natural language processing to provide a finer-grained\ncharacterization of the dynamics of this learning process. We release an open\ncorpus (>15,000 utterances) of extended dyadic interactions in a classic\nrepeated reference game task where pairs of participants had to coordinate on\nhow to refer to initially difficult-to-describe tangram stimuli. We find that\ndifferent pairs discover a wide variety of idiosyncratic but efficient and\nstable solutions to the problem of reference. Furthermore, these conventions\nare shaped by the communicative context: words that are more discriminative in\nthe initial context (i.e. that are used for one target more than others) are\nmore likely to persist through the final repetition. Finally, we find\nsystematic structure in how a speaker's referring expressions become more\nefficient over time: syntactic units drop out in clusters following positive\nfeedback from the listener, eventually leaving short labels containing\nopen-class parts of speech. These findings provide a higher resolution look at\nthe quantitative dynamics of ad hoc convention formation and support further\ndevelopment of computational models of learning in communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 05:25:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 00:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

This leads to the cross-domain few-shot learning problem, where\nthere is a large shift between base and novel class domains. While\ninvestigations of the cross-domain few-shot scenario exist, these works are\nlimited to natural images that still contain a high degree of visual\nsimilarity. No work yet exists that examines few-shot learning across different\nimaging methods seen in real world scenarios, such as aerial and medical\nimaging. In this paper, we propose the Broader Study of Cross-Domain Few-Shot\nLearning (BSCD-FSL) benchmark, consisting of image data from a diverse\nassortment of image acquisition methods. This includes natural images, such as\ncrop disease images, but additionally those that present with an increasing\ndissimilarity to natural images, such as satellite images, dermatology images,\nand radiology images. Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark are\nperformed to evaluate state-of-art meta-learning approaches, transfer learning\napproaches, and newer methods for cross-domain few-shot learning. The results\ndemonstrate that state-of-art meta-learning methods are surprisingly\noutperformed by earlier meta-learning approaches, and all meta-learning methods\nunderperform in relation to simple fine-tuning by 12.8% average accuracy.\nPerformance gains previously observed with methods specialized for cross-domain\nfew-shot learning vanish in this more challenging benchmark. Finally, accuracy\nof all methods tend to correlate with dataset similarity to natural images,\nverifying the value of the benchmark to better represent the diversity of data\nseen in practice and guiding future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 05:29:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 07:30:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 21:33:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

However, there are\nseveral concerns for the transmission/distribution system operators (TSO/DSO)\nwith the frequent dispatching of the distribution-connected fast-responding\nstorage systems. Unfortunately, the existing decoupled models for transmission\nand distribution (T&D) simulations are unable to capture the complex\ninteractions between the two systems especially concerning frequency regulation\nproblems due to rapidly varying distribution-connected distributed energy\nresources (DERs). In this paper, an iteratively coupled T&D hybrid\nco-simulation framework is developed to facilitate the planning studies for the\nsystem operators to help integrate distribution-connected BESS in providing\nfrequency regulation services in response to highly variable DERs such as\nphotovoltaic generation (PVs). Specifically, the proposed framework helps\nevaluate: (1) the effects of distribution-connected DERs/PVs on the response of\nthe system's automatic generation control (AGC) response, and (2) highlights\nthe use of BESS in providing frequency regulation services using integrated T&D\nmodel. The proposed framework is demonstrated using the IEEE 9-bus transmission\nsystem model (operating in dynamics mode) coupled with multiple EPRI Ckt-24\ndistribution system models (operating in quasi-static mode). It is shown that\nthe proposed co-simulation framework helps better visualize the system AGC\nresponse and frequency regulation especially in the presence of high-levels of\nDER generation variability requiring frequent dispatch of BESS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 05:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

It occurs in fluvial environments (i.e., driven by a stream of liquid)\nand in aeolian environments (i.e., wind-blown) and plays a key role in shaping\nsedimentary landscapes of planetary bodies. NST is a highly fluctuating\nphysical process because of turbulence, surface inhomogeneities, and variations\nof grain size and shape and packing geometry. Furthermore, the energy of\ntransported grains varies strongly due to variations of their flow exposure\nduration since their entrainment from the bed. In spite of such variability, we\nhere propose a deterministic model that represents the entire grain motion,\nincluding grains that roll and/or slide along the bed, by a periodic saltation\nmotion with rebound laws that describe an average rebound of a grain after\ncolliding with the bed.

Following the recent observations\nsuggesting that some IW And stars seem to have tilted disks, we have\ninvestigated how the thermal-viscous instability works in tilted accretion\ndisks in dwarf novae and whether it could reproduce the essential features of\nthe light curves in IW And stars. By adopting various simplifying assumptions\nfor tilted disks, we have performed time-dependent one-dimensional numerical\nsimulations of a viscous disk by taking into account various mass supply\npatterns to the disk; that is, the gas stream from the secondary star flows not\nonly to the outer edge of the disk but also to the inner portions of the disk.\nWe find that tilted disks can achieve a new kind of accretion cycle, in which\nthe inner disk almost always stays in the hot state while the outer disk\nrepeats outbursts, thereby reproducing alternating mid-brightness interval\nsometimes with dips and brightening, which are quite reminiscent of the most\ncharacteristic observational light variations of IW And stars. Further, we have\nfound that our simulations produce diverse light variations, depending on\ndifferent mass supply patterns even without time variations in mass transfer\nrates.

To solve this problem,in this paper, we\npropose the pairwise-based MADM algorithm.In the PMADM, only two nodes\nutilities are calculated and compared each time. The PMADM algorithm is much\nmore accurate than the traditional MADM algorithm.

The optimal transmission\nnetwork topology could be very different for different system conditions.\nTransmission network topology control (TNTC) can provide the operator with an\nadditional option to manage network congestion, reduce losses, relieve\nviolation, and achieve cost saving. This paper examines the benefits of TNTC in\nreducing post-contingency overloads that are identified by real-time\ncontingency analysis (RTCA). The procedure of RTCA with TNTC is presented and\ntwo algorithms are proposed to determine the candidate switching solutions.\nBoth algorithms use available system data: sensitivity factors or shifting\nfactors. The proposed two TNTC approaches are based on the transmission\nswitching distribution factor (TSDF) and flow transfer distribution factor\n(FTDF) respectively. FTDF based TNTC approach is an enhanced version of TSDF\nbased TNTC approach by considering network flow distribution.

Several\nfirst-principles studies have been performed in order to investigate the defect\nchemistry of this material. The reported values are, however, scattered over a\nwide range. In this manuscript we perform a comparative study employing\ndifferent approaches based on semilocal, DFT+$U$ and screened hybrid\nfunctionals in order to investigate the dependence of defect properties, such\nas formation energies and charge transition levels, on the employed\ncomputational method. While the defects in anatase, like in most\ntransition-metal oxides, generally induce the localization of electrons or\nholes on atomic sites, we notice that, provided an alignment of the valence\nbands has been performed, the calculated defect formation energies and\ntransition levels using semi-local functionals are in a fair agreement with\nthose obtained using hybrid functionals.

The accelerated bunch had the same parameters, except for the\ncharge, which was equal to 0.3 nC.

However, such a dependency provides valuable clues to\npredict the user's future behavior. For example, a user might buy electronic\naccessories after he/she buy an electronic product.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel seq2seq translation architecture to\nhighlight the importance of sequential dependency in contexts for sequential\nrecommendation. Specifically, we first construct a collateral context sequence\nin addition to the main interaction sequence. We then generalize recent\nadvancements in translation model from sequences of words in two languages to\nsequences of items and contexts in recommender systems. Taking the category\ninformation as an item's context, we develop a basic coupled and an extended\ntripled seq2seq translation models to encode the category-item and\nitem-category-item relations between the item and context sequences.

MUOD detects and classifies outliers by computing for each curve, three\nindices, all based on the concept of linear regression and correlation, which\nmeasure outlyingness in terms of shape, magnitude and amplitude, relative to\nthe other curves in the data. 'Semifast-MUOD', the first method, uses a sample\nof the observations in computing the indices, while 'Fast-MUOD', the second\nmethod, uses the point-wise or $L_1$ median in computing the indices. The\nclassical boxplot is used to separate the indices of the outliers from those of\nthe typical observations.

Among these properties,\nthe vulnerability of the communities (VoCs) is particularly important. In the\nconventional research, only parts of structural features of the community\nrather than multiple aspects are considered in the evaluating model. However,\nin reality, the impact on the VoC is multifaceted, not only its own structure\nproperty, but also the influence of other communities. In order to better model\nthe influence between communities, so as to evaluate the VoCs in the social\nnetwork, a gravity-based community vulnerability evaluation model is proposed\nin this paper. In this proposed model, three different aspects of the factor\nare considered, i.e. the number of edges inside the community, the number of\nedges connected neighboring communities, and the gravity index (GI) of each\ncommunity, which correspond to the interior information, small scale\ninteraction relationship, and large scale interaction relationship of\ncommunities. By means of the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and log-sigmoid\ntransition (LST) function, the abstract distance (AD) between each pair of\ncommunities can be calculated to construct the community network (CN). With the\nusage of gravity model, the GI of each community which describes the large\nscale interaction relationship can be obtained. Eventually, the community\nvulnerability degree and order can be calculated by this proposed model, and\nthe sensitivity of weighting parameters is analyzed by Sobol' indices. In\nparticular, this proposed method can degenerate to the classical method with\nthe setting of weighting parameters. The effectiveness and reasonability of\nthis proposed model are demonstrated by several real world complex networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 11:15:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

Assuming that macroscopic size-splittings are rare, we describe the\nscaling limits of multi-type Markov Branching trees in terms of multi-type\nself-similar fragmentation trees. We observe three different regimes according\nto whether the probability of type change of a size-biased child is\nproportional to the probability of macroscopic splitting (the critical regime,\nin which we get in the limit multi-type fragmentation trees with indeed several\ntypes), smaller than the probability of macroscopic splitting (the solo regime,\nin which the limit trees are monotype as we never see a type change), or larger\nthan the probability of macroscopic splitting (the mixing regime, in which the\ntypes mix and we get monotype fragmentation trees).\n  This framework allows us to unify models which may a priori seem quite\ndifferent, a strength which we illustrate with two notable applications.

We suggest that the eruption was the\nresult of accretion of a proto-planet of a few Earth masses. The proto-planet\nwas shredded by tidal forces before it was accreted onto the YSO, releasing\ngravitational energy that powered the outburst for $\\approx 800$ days, and\nended in a $\\approx 55$ days decline phase. When the accretion material started\ndepleting the accretion rate lowered and the eruption light curve declined for\nalmost two months. Then it exhausted completely, creating a sharp break in the\nlight curve. Another possibility is that the mass was a result of an\ninstability in the proto-planetary disk that lead to a large episode of\naccretion from an inner viscous disk. We find that the variation of the\ntemperature of the outburst is consistent with the surface temperature expected\nfrom a depleted viscous accretion disk. The 2014-2017 outburst of ASASSN-13db\nmay be the least energetic ILOT to have been discovered to date, with an energy\nbudget of only $\\approx 10^{42}$ erg.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 11:50:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

In this paper, we propose a joint\nchromatic and polarimetric demosaicing model to address this challenging\nproblem. Instead of mechanically demosaicing for the multi-channel polarized\ncolor image, we further present a sparse representation-based optimization\nstrategy that utilizes chromatic information and polarimetric information to\njointly optimize the model.

Four variants of D-detectability have been defined: strong (periodic)\nD-detectability and weak (periodic) D-detectability.

According to standard type II\ntheory, planets migrate at the same rate as the gas in the disc, as they are\ncoupled to the disc viscous evolution; however, recent studies questioned this\nparadigm, suggesting that planets migrate faster than the disc material. We\nstudy the problem through 2D long-time simulations of systems consistent with\ntype II regime, using the hydrodynamical grid code FARGO3D. Even though our\nsimulations confirm the presence of an initial phase characterised by fast\nmigration, they also reveal that the migration velocity slows down and\neventually reaches the theoretical prediction if we allow the system to evolve\nfor enough time. We find the same tendency to evolve towards the theoretical\npredictions at later times when we analyse the mass flow through the gap and\nthe torques acting on the planet. This transient is related to the initial\nconditions of our (and previous) simulations, and is due to the fact that the\nshape of the gap has to adjust to a new profile, once the planet is set into\nmotion. Secondly, we test whether the type II theory expectation that giant\nplanet migration is driven by viscosity is consistent with our simulation by\ncomparing simulations with the same viscosity and different disc mass (or\nviceversa). We find a good agreement with the theory, since when the discs are\ncharacterised by the same viscosity, the migration properties are the same.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 12:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

We must therefore ensure that our analyses remain accurate\nin this new era. Accordingly, previously ignored systematic effects must be\naddressed. In this work, we evaluate the impact of the reduced shear\napproximation and magnification bias, on the information obtained from the\nangular power spectrum. To first-order, the statistics of reduced shear, a\ncombination of shear and convergence, are taken to be equal to those of shear.\nHowever, this approximation can induce a bias in the cosmological parameters\nthat can no longer be neglected. A separate bias arises from the statistics of\nshear being altered by the preferential selection of galaxies and the dilution\nof their surface densities, in high-magnification regions. The corrections for\nthese systematic effects take similar forms, allowing them to be treated\ntogether. We calculated the impact of neglecting these effects on the\ncosmological parameters that would be determined from Euclid, using cosmic\nshear tomography. To do so, we employed the Fisher matrix formalism, and\nincluded the impact of the super-sample covariance. We also demonstrate how the\nreduced shear correction can be calculated using a lognormal field forward\nmodelling approach. These effects cause significant biases in Omega_m, sigma_8,\nn_s, Omega_DE, w_0, and w_a of -0.53 sigma, 0.43 sigma, -0.34 sigma, 1.36\nsigma, -0.68 sigma, and 1.21 sigma, respectively. We then show that these\nlensing biases interact with another systematic: the intrinsic alignment of\ngalaxies. Accordingly, we develop the formalism for an intrinsic\nalignment-enhanced lensing bias correction. Applying this to Euclid, we find\nthat the additional terms introduced by this correction are sub-dominant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 12:48:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 17:40:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 13:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

Exploiting again the maximal gauge condition on the boundary, this\ncontribution to the flux integrals can then be absorbed by a careful trace\ninequality in the interior energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 13:24:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

Although chimera morphology and properties have been\ninvestigated in a number of models, the mechanism responsible for their\nformation is still not well understood. To shed light in the chimera producing\nmechanism, in the present study we introduce an oscillatory model with variable\nfrequency governed by a 3rd order equation. In this model single oscillators\nare constructed as bistable and depending on the initial conditions their\nfrequency may result in one of the two stable fixed points, $\\omega _l$ and\n$\\omega _h $ (two-level synchronization). Numerical simulations demonstrate\nthat these oscillators organize in domains with alternating frequencies, when\nthey are nonlocally coupled in networks. In each domain the oscillators\nsynchronize, sequential domains follow different modes of synchronization and\nthe border elements between two consecutive domains form the asynchronous\ndomains. We investigate the influence of the frequency coupling constant and of\nthe coupling range on the chimera morphology and we show that the chimera\nmultiplicity decreases as the coupling range increases. The frequency spectrum\nis calculated in the coherent and incoherent domains of this model. In the\ncoherent domains single frequencies ($\\omega _l$ or $\\omega _h$) are observed,\nwhile in the incoherent domains both $\\omega _l$ and $\\omega _h$ as well as\ntheir superpositions appear.

The first one consists of centralized\nalgorithms, where all processes send their events to a specific decision-making\nprocess, which keeps track of all the events to evaluate the specified\nproperty. The second approach consists of distributed algorithms, where\nprocesses check the specified property collaboratively. Centralized algorithms\nare simple, but usually involve sending a large number of messages to the\ndecision-making process. They also suffer from the problem of single point of\nfailure, as well as high traffic loads towards one process. Distributed\nalgorithms, on the other hand, are usually more complicated, but once\nimplemented, offer more efficiency. In this paper, we focus on a class of\nasynchronous distributed systems, where each process can change its own local\nstate at any arbitrary time and completely independent of others, while all\nprocesses share a global clock. We propose a sound and complete algorithm for\ndecentralized runtime verification of LTL properties in these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 13:54:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 11:09:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2020 15:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

Under BODE methods,\nsequential design of experiments (SDOE) accomplishes this task by selecting an\noptimal sequence of experiments while using data-driven probabilistic surrogate\nmodels instead of the expensive black-box function. Probabilistic predictions\nfrom the surrogate model are used to define an information acquisition function\n(IAF) which quantifies the marginal value contributed or the expected\ninformation gained by a hypothetical experiment. The next experiment is\nselected by maximizing the IAF. A generally applicable IAF is the expected\ninformation gain (EIG) about a QoI as captured by the expectation of the\nKullback-Leibler divergence between the predictive distribution of the QoI\nafter doing a hypothetical experiment and the current predictive distribution\nabout the same QoI. We model the underlying information source as a\nfully-Bayesian, non-stationary Gaussian process (FBNSGP), and derive an\napproximation of the information gain of a hypothetical experiment about an\narbitrary QoI conditional on the hyper-parameters The EIG about the same QoI is\nestimated by sample averages to integrate over the posterior of the\nhyper-parameters and the potential experimental outcomes. We demonstrate the\nperformance of our method in four numerical examples and a practical\nengineering problem of steel wire manufacturing. The method is compared to two\nclassic SDOE methods: random sampling and uncertainty sampling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 13:55:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

These theoretical properties allow us to take\nadvantage of the alternating direction method of multipliers. In addition, the\n$L_{0/1}$-support vector operator is introduced as a filter to prevent outliers\nfrom being support vectors during the training process. Hence, the method is\nexpected to be relatively robust. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate\nthat our proposed method generates better performance in terms of much shorter\ncomputational time with much fewer number of support vectors when against with\nsome other leading methods in areas of SVM. When the data size gets bigger, its\nadvantage becomes more evident.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 14:42:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 13:36:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 03:30:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 14:30:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

A state-of-the-art method has been recently using word\nmodeling algorithms in combination with community detection mechanisms to\nachieve better results in a more effective way. We analyse results of this\napproach and discuss the two major challenges that this approach still faces.\nAlthough the topics that have resulted from the recent algorithm are good in\ngeneral, they are very noisy due to many topics that are very unimportant\nbecause of their size, words, or ambiguity. Additionally, the number of words\ndefining each topic is too large, making it difficult to analyse them in their\nunsorted state. In this paper, we propose approaches to tackle these challenges\nby adding topic filtering and network analysis metrics to define the importance\nof a topic. We test different combinations of these metrics to see which\ncombination yields the best results. Furthermore, we add word filtering and\nranking to each topic to identify the words with the highest novelty\nautomatically. We evaluate our enhancement methods in two ways: human\nqualitative evaluation and automatic quantitative evaluation. Moreover, we\ncreated two case studies to test the quality of the clusters and words. In the\nquantitative evaluation, we use the pairwise mutual information score to test\nthe coherency of topics. The quantitative evaluation also includes an analysis\nof execution times for each part of the program. The results of the\nexperimental evaluations show that the two evaluation methods agree on the\npositive feasibility of the algorithm. We then show possible extensions in the\nform of usability and future improvements to the algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 14:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

Neural networks are usually\ntrained to reduce the overall number of errors, attaching identical loss to\nerrors of all kinds. However, this is not necessarily aligned with human\nintuition. For instance, an overlooked pedestrian seems more severe than an\nincorrectly detected one. One possible remedy is to deploy different decision\nrules by introducing class priors which assigns larger weight to\nunderrepresented classes. While reducing the false-negatives of the\nunderrepresented class, at the same time this leads to a considerable increase\nof false-positive indications. In this work, we combine decision rules with\nmethods for false-positive detection. We therefore fuse false-negative\ndetection with uncertainty based false-positive meta classification.

In each period,\nthe retailer's available cash restricts the maximum quantity that can be\nordered. There exists a fixed ordering cost for the retailer when purchasing.\nWe partially characterize the optimal ordering policy by showing it has an $\\bf\ns-C$ structure: for each period, when initial inventory is above the $\\bf$s\nthreshold, no product should be ordered no matter how much initial cash it has;\nwhen initial inventory is not large enough to be a $\\bf s$ threshold, it is\nalso better to not order when initial cash is below the threshold $C$. The\nvalues of $C$ may be state-dependent and related to each period's initial\ninventory. A heuristic policy $(s, C(x), S)$ is proposed: when initial\ninventory $x$ is less than $s$ and initial cash is greater than $C(x)$, order a\nquantity that brings inventory as close to $S$ as possible; otherwise, do not\norder. We first determine the values of the controlling parameters $s$, $C(x)$\nand $S$ based on the results of stochastic dynamic programming and test their\nperformance via an extensive computational study.

It then follows from the infinite distance conjecture that\nthere must be a tower of states in the infinite entropy limit, and that\nignoring these towers on the horizon of the black hole would invalidate the\neffective theory when the entropy becomes large. We call this the black hole\nentropy distance conjecture. We then study two candidates for the tower of\nstates. The first are the Kaluza-Klein modes of the internal geometry of\nextremal ${\\cal N}=2$ black holes in string theory, whose masses on the horizon\nare fixed by the ${\\cal N}=2$ attractor formalism, and given in terms of the\nblack hole charges similarly to the entropy.

In fact, existing game semantics of LL\nemploys concurrency, which is rather exotic to game semantics of ILL, IL or CL.\nAlso, linear negation in LL is never true in (game semantics of) ILL, IL or CL.\nIn search for the truly linear refinement of CL, we carve out (a sequent\ncalculus of) linear logic negative ($LL^-$) from (the two-sided sequent\ncalculus of) LL, and introducing a new distribution axiom $! ?

The power\ngrid is modeled as a stochastic dynamical system where first-principles\nelectromechanical dynamics are excited by small Gaussian disturbances in demand\nand generation around a specified operating point. In this context, a single\nline failure is interpreted in a large deviation context as a first escape\nevent across a surface in phase space defined by line security constraints. The\nresulting system of stochastic differential equations admits a transverse\ndecomposition of the drift, which leads to considerable simplification in\nevaluating the quasipotential (rate function) and, consequently, computation of\nexit rates. Tractable expressions for the rate of transmission line failure in\na restricted network are derived from large deviation theory arguments and\nvalidated against numerical simulations. Extensions to realistic settings are\nconsidered, and individual line failure models are aggregated into a Markov\nmodel of cascading failure inspired by chemical kinetics. Cascades are\ngenerated by traversing a graph composed of weighted edges representing\ntransitions to degraded network topologies. Numerical results indicate that the\nMarkov model can produce cascades with qualitative power-law properties similar\nto those observed in empirical cascades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 04:25:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

In order to test\npossible departures from General Relativity, it is essential to analyse, in a\nmodified gravity setting, how GWs propagate through a perturbed cosmological\nspace-time. Working within the framework of geometrical optics, we develop\ntools to address this topic for a broad class of scalar-tensor theories,\nincluding scenarios with non-minimal, derivative couplings between scalar and\ntensor modes. We determine the corresponding evolution equations for the GW\namplitude and polarization tensor. The former satisfies a generalised evolution\nequation that includes possible effects due to a variation of the effective\nPlanck scale; the latter can fail to be parallely transported along GW\ngeodesics unless certain conditions are satisfied. We apply our general\nformulas to specific scalar-tensor theories with unit tensor speed, and then\nfocus on GW propagation on a perturbed space-time. We determine corrections to\nstandard formulas for the GW luminosity distance and for the evolution of the\npolarization tensor, which depend both on modified gravity and on the effects\nof cosmological perturbations. Our results can constitute a starting point to\ndisentangle among degeneracies from different sectors that can influence GW\npropagation through cosmological space-times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 15:38:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 18:08:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 10:10:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

Previous work shows that such a stiff equation of state is\npossible if the ground state has nucleons as its constituents. We find this to\nbe so in a chiral soliton ( skyrmion ) model for a composite nucleon which has\nbound state quarks. The strong binding of the quarks in this composite nucleon\nis plausibly the origin of the nucleon-nucleon hard core. In this model we find\na new state of superdense matter at high density which is a 'topological'cubic\ncrystal of overlapping composite nucleons that are solitons with relativistic\nquark bound states. The quarks are frozen in a filled band of a unique state,\nwhich not an eigenstate of spin or isospin but an eigenstate of spin plus\nisospin, $ \\vec S + \\vec I = 0$.

For\nreducing the transmission delay and duplicate transmission in opportunistic\nrouting, the candidate forwarding set optimization technology is proposed. This\ntechnology is crucial to opportunistic routing. The prior arts have limitations\non improving the routing performances. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the\nconcept of the network-based approach to address the disadvantages of prior\narts. In the network-based approach, the nodes in the candidate forwarding set\nare divided into different fully connected relay networks. For the forwarding\nnodes in CFS, more than one relay network can be constructed and only one relay\nnetwork can be chosen as the final relay network. So, first, we propose the\nfully connected relay network judgment algorithm to judge whether the chosen\nnetwork is fully connected or not. Next, the properties of these networks are\ninvestigated. In this algorithm, the relay network selection takes the packet\ndelivery probability between the sender and the relay networks, the\ntransmission delay, and the forwarding priorities of nodes in relay networks\ninto account to choose the most effective relay network. The nodes in this\nrelay network will be chosen as final forwarding nodes. By these, the\ntransmission delay and duplicate transmission are reduced while the efficiency\nof opportunistic routing is kept. Based on these innovations, the proposed\nalgorithm can improve network performances greater than that of ExOR and SOAR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 09:22:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

One way to harness this near-field\nenergy is to scatter it to the far field. Another way is to bring absorbers\nclose to thermal emitters, and the advent of a full class of novel photonic\ndevices exploiting thermal photons in the near field has been predicted in the\nlast two decades. However, efficient heat-to-electricity conversion of\nnear-field thermal photons, i.e. the seminal building block, could not be\nachieved experimentally until now. Here, by approaching a micron-sized infrared\nphotovoltaic cell at nanometric distances from a hot surface, we demonstrate\nconversion efficiency up to 14% leading to unprecedented electrical power\ndensity output (7500 W.m-2), orders of magnitude larger than all previous\nattempts. This proof of principle is achieved by using hot graphite microsphere\nemitters (~800 K) and indium antimonide cells, whose low bandgap energy matches\nthe emitter infrared spectrum and which are specially designed for the near\nfield. These results pave the way for efficient photoelectric detectors\nconverting thermal photons directly in the near field.

The well-known algebraic characterization\nof essential matrices, i.e. necessary and sufficient conditions under which an\narbitrary matrix (of rank two) becomes essential, consists of a unique matrix\nequation of degree three. Based on this equation, a number of efficient\nalgorithmic solutions to different relative pose estimation problems have been\nproposed.

We consider the most challenging regime of exact observations and\nprovide two new methodologies for inference in this case: the minimal extended\nstate space algorithm (MESA) and the nearly minimal extended state space\nalgorithm (nMESA). By extending the Markov chain Monte Carlo state space, both\nMESA and nMESA use the exponentiation of finite rate matrices to perform exact\nBayesian inference on the Markov jump process even though its state space is\ncountably infinite. Numerical experiments show improvements over particle MCMC\nof between a factor of three and several orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 15:58:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 16:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

One of the most important is Ethernet\nbased C-RAN, in support of which many products such as optical Ethernet\nswitches have recently appeared on the market. This paper presents the\nperformance analysis of such switches with respect to Packet Loss Ratio (PLR),\nLatency and Packet Delay Variation (PDV). We employed the Simula based on\nDiscrete Event Modelling on Simula (DEMOS), a context class for discrete event\nsimulation to simulate a cut-through optical Ethernet switch under two types of\ntraffics: High priority (HP) traffic and Low priority (LP) traffic. In this\nway, the paper evaluates the optical Ethernet switch performance\nquantitatively. The results obtained from the simulator showed that the high\nquality of service was reflected on HP traffic and the low quality of service\nin LP traffic. Hence, HP traffic can be used for transporting Radio over\nEthernet (RoE) traffic while LP traffic can used for transporting time\ninsensitive application. It is also found that HP traffic experiences a PDV\nequals to the duration of maximum sized LP traffic in Optical Ethernet switch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 07:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-23"}

Gaming is a popular\nactivity on mobile devices and the explosive growth in the number of games\ncoupled with their growing size contributes to the storage crunch. Even where\nstorage is plentiful, it takes a long time to download and install a heavy app\nbefore it can be launched. This paper presents AppStreamer, a novel technique\nfor reducing the storage requirements or startup delay of mobile games, and\nheavy mobile apps in general. AppStreamer is based on the intuition that most\napps do not need the entirety of its files (images, audio and video clips,\netc.) at any one time. AppStreamer can, therefore, keep only a small part of\nthe files on the device, akin to a \"cache\", and download the remainder from a\ncloud storage server or a nearby edge server when it predicts that the app will\nneed them in the near future. AppStreamer continuously predicts file blocks for\nthe near future as the user uses the app, and fetches them from the storage\nserver before the user sees a stall due to missing resources. We implement\nAppStreamer at the Android file system layer. This ensures that the apps\nrequire no source code or modification, and the approach generalizes across\napps. We evaluate AppStreamer using two popular games: Dead Effect 2, a 3D\nfirst-person shooter, and Fire Emblem Heroes, a 2D turn-based strategy\nrole-playing game. Through a user study, 75% and 87% of the users respectively\nfind that AppStreamer provides the same quality of user experience as the\nbaseline where all files are stored on the device. AppStreamer cuts down the\nstorage requirement by 87% for Dead Effect 2 and 86% for Fire Emblem Heroes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 08:42:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-23"}

The later generates heterogeneous surface charge\nat channel walls depending on the applied gate potential i.e. applying low gate\npotential enables effective modulation of surface charge with the same polarity\nof the intrinsic charge at channel walls, while moderate gate potential causes\ncharge inversion in diverging sections of the channel and generates reverse\nflow and thus results in fluid flow circulation. The potential application of\nflow circulation for trapping and rejection of particles is also demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 15:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}
