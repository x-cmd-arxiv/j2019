Consequently, high-speed actuation and locking of microcombs have\nbeen attained only with off-chip bulk modulators. Here, we present high-speed\nmicrocomb actuation using integrated components. By monolithically integrating\npiezoelectric AlN actuators on ultralow-loss Si3N4 photonic circuits, we\ndemonstrate voltage-controlled soliton tuning, modulation and stabilization.\nThe integrated AlN actuators feature bi-directional tuning with high linearity\nand low hysteresis, operate with 300 nW power and exhibit flat actuation\nresponse up to megahertz frequency, significantly exceeding bulk piezo tuning\nbandwidth. We use this novel capability to demonstrate a microcomb engine for\nparallel FMCW LiDAR, via synchronously tuning the laser and microresonator. By\napplying a triangular sweep at the modulation rate matching the frequency\nspacing of HBAR modes, we exploit the resonant build-up of bulk acoustic energy\nto significantly lower the required driving to a CMOS voltage of only 7 Volts.\nOur approach endows soliton microcombs with integrated,\nultralow-power-consumption, and fast actuation, significantly expanding the\nrepertoire of technological applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 16:00:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 11:17:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

They are defined by real or complex integrals regulated\nwith polynomials with exponents, and are meromorphic functions of the\nexponents, sharing various properties of string amplitudes. As $\\alpha' \\to 0$,\nthey reduce to the usual canonical form of a polytope given by the Minkowski\nsum of the Newton polytopes of the regulating polynomials, or equivalently the\nvolume of the dual of this polytope, naturally determined by tropical\nfunctions. At finite $\\alpha'$, they have simple poles corresponding to the\nfacets of the polytope, with the residue on the pole given by the stringy\ncanonical form of the facet. There is the remarkable connection between the\n$\\alpha' \\to 0$ limit of tree-level string amplitudes, and scattering equations\nthat appear when studying the $\\alpha' \\to \\infty$ limit. We show that there is\na simple conceptual understanding of this phenomenon for any stringy canonical\nform: the saddle-point equations provide a diffeomorphism from the integration\ndomain to the interior of the polytope, and thus the canonical form can be\nobtained as a pushforward via summing over saddle points. When the stringy\ncanonical form is applied to the ABHY associahedron in kinematic space, it\nproduces the usual Koba-Nielsen string integral, giving a direct path from\nparticle to string amplitudes without an a priori reference to the string\nworldsheet. We also discuss a number of other examples, including stringy\ncanonical forms for finite-type cluster algebras (with type A for string\namplitudes), and other natural integrals over the positive Grassmannian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 16:36:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 10:54:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 01:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-05"}

We derive analytical\nexpressions for the variational equations governing the spin and orbital\nevolution, which are expressed as high-order elliptical expansions in the\nsemimajor axis ratio but retain closed form in terms of the binary and\nplanetary eccentricities. These are found to reproduce the results of the\nnumerical simulations with arbitrary eccentricities very well, as well as\nreducing to our previous results in the low-eccentric case. Our model is then\napplied to the well-characterised Kepler circumbinary systems by analysing the\ntidal timescales and unveiling the tidal flow around each different system. In\nall cases we find that the spins reach stationary values much faster than the\ncharacteristic timescale of the orbital evolution, indicating that all Kepler\ncircumbinary planets are expected to be in a sub-synchronous state. On the\nother hand, all systems are located in a tidal flow leading to outward\nmigration; thus the proximity of the planets to the orbital instability limit\nmay have been even greater in the past. Additionally, Kepler systems may have\nsuffered a significant tidally induced eccentricity damping, which may be\nrelated to their proximity to the capture eccentricity.

In this work, we propose the Interleaved\nComposite Quantization (ICQ) which achieves fast similarity search without\nusing shorter codes. In ICQ, a small subset of the code is used to approximate\nthe distances, with complete codes being used only when necessary. Our method\neffectively reduces both code length and quantization error.

We prove that a fundamental\nclass of distributed control problems - commonly referred to as Quadratically\nInvariant (QI) problems - as well as others possess this property. To the best\nof our knowledge, our result is the first sample-complexity bound guarantee on\nlearning globally optimal distributed output-feedback control policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 18:11:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 10:22:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 30 May 2020 13:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

For such quantitative measurements, either the oscillation\nfrequency or the oscillation amplitude and the phase of a vibrating cantilever\nare recorded as a function of the tip-sample separation.

Especially problematic is the\nentanglement between this incompleteness and the true cosmological signal,\narising from the fact that the proportion of successful observations is\ntypically lower in regions with higher density of galaxies. The result is a\nfictitious suppression of the galaxy clustering that, if not properly\ncorrected, can impact severely on cosmological-parameter inference. Recent\ndevelopments in the field have shown that an unbiased estimate of the 2-point\ncorrelation function in the presence of missing observations can be obtained by\nweighting each pair by its inverse probability of being targeted.

However, the EUV dissociation of hydrogen molecules can\nalso theoretically drive atmospheric evaporation on low-mass planets. For\ntemperate planets such as the early Earth, impact erosion is expected to\ndominate in the traditional planetesimal accretion model, but it would be\ngreatly reduced in pebble accretion scenarios, allowing other mass loss\nprocesses to be major contributors. We apply the same prescription for\nphotoionization to this photodissociation mechanism and compare it to an\nanalysis of other possible sources of mass loss in pebble accretion scenarios.\nWe find that there is not a clear path to evaporating the primordial atmosphere\naccreted by an early Earth analog in a pebble accretion scenario. Impact\nerosion could remove ~2,300 bars of hydrogen if 1% of the planet's mass is\naccreted as planetesimals, while the combined photoevaporation processes could\nevaporate ~750 bars of hydrogen. Photodissociation is likely a subdominant, but\nsignificant component of mass loss. Similar results apply to super-Earths and\nmini-Neptunes. This mechanism could also preferentially remove hydrogen from a\nplanet's primordial atmosphere, thereby leaving a larger abundance of\nprimordial water compared to standard dry formation models.

This holds in particular in the regime of two spatial dimensions,\nwhose experimental exploration is currently pursued with strong efforts in\nquantum simulators. In this work we present a versatile and efficient machine\nlearning inspired approach based on a recently introduced artificial neural\nnetwork encoding of quantum many-body wave functions. We identify and resolve\nsome key challenges for the simulation of time evolution, which previously\nimposed significant limitations on the accurate description of large systems\nand long-time dynamics. As a concrete example, we study the dynamics of the\nparadigmatic two-dimensional transverse field Ising model, as recently also\nrealized experimentally in systems of Rydberg atoms. Calculating the\nnonequilibrium real-time evolution across a broad range of parameters, we, for\ninstance, observe collapse and revival oscillations of ferromagnetic order and\ndemonstrate that the reached time scales are comparable to or exceed the\ncapabilities of state-of-the-art tensor network methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 19:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 20:53:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 22:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

The BH-disk configuration is a solution of the Einstein field\nequations within the Weyl class. The disk is sourced by a distributional\nenergy-momentum tensor and it is located at the equatorial plane. It can be\ninterpreted as two streams of counter-rotating particles, yielding a total\nvanishing angular momentum. The phenomenology of the composed system depends on\ntwo parameters: the fraction of the total mass in the disk, $m$, and the\nlocation of the inner edge of the disk, $a$. We start by determining the\nsub-region of the space of parameters wherein the solution is physical, by\nrequiring the velocity of the disk particles to be sub-luminal and real. Then,\nwe study the null geodesic flow by performing backwards ray-tracing under two\nscenarios. In the first scenario the composed system is illuminated by the disk\nand in the second scenario the composed system is illuminated by a far-away\ncelestial sphere. Both cases show that, as $m$ grows, the shadow becomes more\nprolate. Additionally, the first scenario makes clear that as $m$ grows, for\nfixed $a$, the geometrically thin disk appears optically enlarged, i.e.,\nthicker, when observed from the equatorial plane. This is to due to light rays\nthat are bent towards the disk, when backwards ray traced. In the second\nscenario, these light rays can cross the disk (which is assumed to be\ntransparent) and may oscillate up to a few times before reaching the far away\ncelestial sphere. Consequently, an almost equatorial observer sees different\npatches of the sky near the equatorial plane, as a chaotic \"mirage\".

Regions of space with a large CC are short lived and are\ndynamically driven to crunch soon after the end of inflation. Conversely,\nregions with a small CC are metastable and long lived and are the only ones to\nsurvive until late times. While the mechanism assumes many domains with\ndifferent CC values, it does not result in eternal inflation nor does it\nrequire a long period of inflation to populate them. We present a concrete\ndynamical model, based on a super-cooled first order phase transition in a\nhidden conformal sector, that may successfully implement such a crunching\nmechanism. We find that the mechanism can only solve the CC problem up to the\nweak scale, above which new physics, such as supersymmetry, is needed to solve\nthe CC problem all the way to the UV cutoff scale. The absence of experimental\nevidence for such new physics already implies a mild little hierarchy problem\nfor the CC. Curiously, in this approach the weak scale arises as the geometric\nmean of the temperature in our universe today and the Planck scale, hinting on\na new \"CC miracle\", motivating new physics at the weak scale independent of\nelectroweak physics. We further predict the presence of new relativistic\ndegrees of freedom in the CFT that should be visible in the next round of CMB\nexperiments.

In this paper we present a pilot study of 21 S0\ngalaxies in extreme environments (field and cluster), and compare their\nspatially-resolved kinematics and global stellar populations. Our aim is to\nidentify whether there are different mechanisms that form S0s in different\nenvironments. Our results show that the kinematics of S0 galaxies in field and\ncluster are, indeed, different. Lenticulars in the cluster are more\nrotationally supported, suggesting that they are formed through processes that\ninvolve the rapid consumption or removal of gas (e.g. starvation, ram pressure\nstripping). In contrast, S0s in the field are more pressure supported,\nsuggesting that minor mergers served mostly to shape their kinematic\nproperties. These results are independent of total mass, luminosity, or\ndisk-to-bulge ratio. On the other hand, the mass-weighted age, metallicity, and\nstar formation time-scale of the galaxies correlate more with mass than with\nenvironment, in agreement with known relations from previous work such as the\none between mass and metallicity. Overall, our results re-enforce the idea that\nthere are multiple mechanisms that produce S0s, and that both mass $and$\nenvironment play key roles. A larger sample is highly desirable to confirm or\nrefute the results and the interpretation of this pilot study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 19:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

The\nmanagement of such ground sensor communication together with a team of flying\nUAVs constitutes an interesting data muling problem which still deserves to be\naddressed and investigated.

However, locally semantic change,\nsuch as scene composition, relative position between objects, spectral\nvariability caused by illumination, atmospheric effects, and material mixture,\nhas been less frequently investigated in modeling spatial information. As a\nconsequence, identifying the same materials from spatially different scenes or\npositions can be difficult. In this paper, we propose a solution to address\nthis issue by locally extracting invariant features from hyperspectral imagery\n(HSI) in both spatial and frequency domains, using a method called invariant\nattribute profiles (IAPs). IAPs extract the spatial invariant features by\nexploiting isotropic filter banks or convolutional kernels on HSI and spatial\naggregation techniques (e.g., superpixel segmentation) in the Cartesian\ncoordinate system. Furthermore, they model invariant behaviors (e.g., shift,\nrotation) by the means of a continuous histogram of oriented gradients\nconstructed in a Fourier polar coordinate. This yields a combinatorial\nrepresentation of spatial-frequency invariant features with application to HSI\nclassification. Extensive experiments conducted on three promising\nhyperspectral datasets (Houston2013 and Houston2018) demonstrate the\nsuperiority and effectiveness of the proposed IAP method in comparison with\nseveral state-of-the-art profile-related techniques.

Learning\nin a mixture model consists of finding the most likely cluster assignment for\neach data-point, as well as finding the parameters of the clusters themselves.\nIn many mixture models, this is difficult with current learning methods, where\nthe most common approach is to employ monotone learning algorithms e.g. the\nconventional expectation-maximisation algorithm. While effective, the success\nof any monotone algorithm is crucially dependant on good parameter\ninitialisation, where a common choice is $K$-means initialisation, commonly\nemployed for Gaussian mixture models.\n  For other types of mixture models, the path to good initialisation parameters\nis often unclear and may require a problem-specific solution. To this end, we\npropose a general heuristic learning algorithm that utilises Boltzmann\nexploration to assign each observation to a specific base distribution within\nthe mixture model, which we call Boltzmann exploration expectation-maximisation\n(BEEM).

The\nmaterial's polymer network retains a memory of its shape history, so its\ncurrent and future shapes depend strikingly on its past shapes. Although VSR's\nmemory fades gradually and it has a permanent (cured-in) shape to which it will\neventually return when left alone, VSR can be taught new shapes and retain them\nfor significant lengths of time.\n  To examine VSR's ability to learn, remember, and recover shapes, this work\nfocuses on a simple experiment. A VSR that has relaxed into its permanent shape\nis suddenly compressed to about 80% of its original height. After a specific\nperiod of compression, the VSR is released and allowed to return to its\npermanent shape. Having learned a new shape during the compression period,\nhowever, the VSR is reluctant to return and takes seconds, minutes, or hours to\ndo so, depending on how long it was compressed.\n  In addition to observing these behaviors experimentally in VSR, we show that\nthose behaviors are well-described by the Fractional Zener model. That model\ninvolves time derivatives of non-integer order and those generalized time\nderivatives have memory. Both VSR and the Fractional Zener model describing it\nare acutely aware of the past.\n  The model's mathematical machinery make it possible to design VSR behaviors\nbased on physical parameters, although some of the model's relationships are\nnot yet known in closed form. VSR's existence as a practical material means\nthat devices can be designed and produced that use a memory of past shapes to\ndo things that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to make.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 21:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-20"}

The inclusion of gauge three-forms delivers a dynamical way to\ngenerate flux-induced superpotentials. Instead, gauge two-forms, dual\ndescriptions of axions, may be eventually gauged by three-forms to generate a\nsuperpotential coupling between the different chiral multiplet sectors of the\ntheory. The mutual constraints among the background fluxes, such as tadpole\ncancellations, are imposed by gauge four-forms. A hierarchy of objects, to\nwhich the gauge forms couple, is then introduced: four-dimensional BPS-strings,\nmembranes and 3-branes enlarge the Landscape, allowing the background fluxes to\nconsistently change transversing different spacetime regions. The Freed-Witten\nanomaly cancellations and the changing of tadpole cancellation conditions due\nto background sources are neatly expressed by BPS-junctions of membranes ending\non strings and 3-branes ending on membranes.

In another step of this approach, the renormalization scheme\ndependence of QCD observables, characterized by Stevenson, is required to be\nexamined. In this regard, two choices of renormalization scheme would be\nexposed. In one of them, the QCD observable is expressed in terms of two powers\nof running coupling constant. In the other one, the perturbative series\nexpansion is written as an infinite series in terms of the two-loop running\ncoupling represented by the Lambert $W$-function.

In contrast to\nadversarial alignment, we propose to explicitly train a domain-invariant\nclassifier by generating and defensing against pointwise feature space\nadversarial perturbations. Specifically, we firstly perturb the intermediate\nfeature maps with several attack objectives (i.e., discriminator and\nclassifier) on each individual position for both domains, and then the\nclassifier is trained to be invariant to the perturbations. By perturbing each\nposition individually, our model treats each location evenly regardless of the\ncategory or object size and thus circumvents the aforementioned issue.\nMoreover, the domain gap in feature space is reduced by extrapolating source\nand target perturbed features towards each other with attack on the domain\ndiscriminator.

Such settings are frequently encountered in neural\nnetwork design, hyper-parameter optimization, and many simulation-based\nreal-world optimization tasks, in which evaluations are costly and time sparse.\nIt seems intuitive that well-distributed samples should be more meaningful in\none-shot decision making settings than uniform or grid-based samples, since\nthey show a better coverage of the decision space. In practice, quasi-random\ndesigns such as Latin Hypercube Samples and low-discrepancy point sets form\nindeed the state of the art, as confirmed by a number of recent studies and\ncompetitions. In this work we take a closer look into the correlation between\nthe distribution of the quasi-random designs and their performance in one-shot\ndecision making tasks, with the goal to investigate whether the assumed\ncorrelation between uniform distribution and performance can be confirmed. We\nstudy three different decision tasks: classic one-shot optimization (only the\nbest sample matters), one-shot optimization with surrogates (allowing to use\nsurrogate models for selecting a design that need not necessarily be one of the\nevaluated samples), and one-shot regression (i.e., function approximation, with\nminimization of mean squared error as objective). Our results confirm an\nadvantage of low-discrepancy designs for all three settings. The overall\ncorrelation, however, is rather weak. We complement our study by evolving\nproblem-specific samples that show significantly better performance for the\nregression task than the standard approaches based on low-discrepancy\nsequences, giving strong indication that significant performance gains over\nstate-of-the-art one-shot sampling techniques are possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 00:20:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 10:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-23"}

The aim of the International GCM\nWorkshop series is to bring together researchers interested in all aspects of\ncomputation models based on graphs and graph transformation. It promotes the\ncross-fertilizing exchange of ideas and experiences among senior and young\nresearchers from the different communities interested in the foundations,\napplications, and implementations of graph computation models and related\nareas.\n  These post-proceedings contain four selected papers from GCM2019 proceedings\nand an invited presentation that gives an account of the very successful panel\ndiscussion dedicated to the Analysis of Graph Transformation Systems, which\ntook place during the workshop and was animated by Reiko Heckel, Leen Lambers\nand Maryam Ghaffari Saadat.\n  All submissions were subject to careful refereeing.

No successful strategies have been proposed for the\ncontrol of mesoscale storms. Here we show that a strategic use of consumer air\nconditioners, which can typically remove about 1kg of moisture from the air per\nhour when run in dehumidification mode, and which are installed in large\nnumbers in big cities, can modulate a storm downstream. We numerically\nreproduced a storm training that affected the Hiroshima metropolis in Japan in\n2014, and conducted experiments to test the sensitivity of the storm to the\ninitial moisture field near the surface. We propose an empirically-derived\nformula for a control efficiency parameter, which can be used to estimate the\nimpact of moisture removal on the rainfall accumulation. It reveals that\nremoval of half a kiloton of moisture, which could be achieved within half an\nhour in a city with a population of one million since more than one air\nconditioner is installed per capita in Japan, could lead to a significant\nreduction of the total rainfall accumulation over a 100 km2 area of heavy rain\nduring the storm event. Conversely, our results indicate that some summertime\nstorms occurring inside or near a metropolis could be strengthened by the\nexcess moisture discharged from large numbers of air conditioners used for\ncooling rooms. We anticipate our results, which reveal that human activity can\nhave a significant impact on storms, will be a starting point for considering\nthe coupling of weather and the economy, and will contribute to the development\nof a sustainable society.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 02:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-20"}

The loss of the relative phase information,\ntermed decoherence, arises from the interactions between a quantum system and\nits environment. Decoherence is perhaps the biggest obstacle on the path to\nreliable quantum computing. Here we show that decoherence occurs even in an\nisolated molecule although not all phase information is lost via a theoretical\nstudy of a central electron spin qubit interacting with nearby nuclear spins in\nprototypical magnetic molecules. The residual coherence, which is\nmolecule-dependent, provides a microscopic rationalization for the nuclear spin\ndiffusion barrier proposed to explain experiments. The contribution of nearby\nmolecules to the decoherence has a non-trivial dependence on separation,\npeaking at intermediate distances. Molecules that are far away only affect the\nlong-time behavior. Because the residual coherence is simple to calculate and\ncorrelates well with the coherence time, it can be used as a descriptor for\ncoherence in magnetic molecules. This work will help establish design\nprinciples for enhancing coherence in molecular spin qubits and serve to\nmotivate further theoretical work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 02:39:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-20"}

MaaS systems tend to involve service systems\nwith fleets of vehicles; as a result, the available service capacity depends on\nthe choices of other travelers in different parts of the system. We model this\nwith a new concept of \"congestible capacity\"; that is, link capacities are a\nfunction of flow instead of link costs. This dependency is also non-separable;\nthe capacity in one link can depend on flows from multiple links. An\noffline-online estimation method is introduced to capture the structural\neffects that flows have on capacities and the resulting impacts on route choice\nutilities. The method is first applied to obtain unique congestible capacity\nshadow prices in a multimodal network to verify the capability to capture\ncongestion effects on capacities. The capacities are shown to vary and impact\nthe utility of a route. The method is validated using real system data from\nCiti Bike in New York City. The results show that the model can fit to the data\nquite well and performs better than a baseline modeling approach that ignores\ncongestible capacity effects. By relating the route choice to congestible\ncapacities using a random utility model, modelers can monitor and quantify the\nimpacts to traveler consumer surplus in real time. Applications of the model\nand online method include monitoring capacity effects on consumer surplus,\nusing the model to direct incentives programs for rebalancing and other revenue\nmanagement strategies, and to guide resource allocation to mitigate consumer\nsurplus impacts due to disruptions from incidents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 03:31:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Jul 2021 02:23:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

In this paper, we show that\nproperly modeling scale-invariance into neural networks can bring significant\nbenefits to image restoration performance. Inspired from spatial-wise\nconvolution for shift-invariance, \"scale-wise convolution\" is proposed to\nconvolve across multiple scales for scale-invariance. In our scale-wise\nconvolutional network (SCN), we first map the input image to the feature space\nand then build a feature pyramid representation via bi-linear down-scaling\nprogressively.

While the idea of extending multigrid methods to\nsaddle point systems can already be found, e.g., in the context of Stokes and\nOseen equations in literature, the main contributions of this work are (i) the\ndevelopment and open-source implementation of an interface aggregation strategy\nspecifically suited for generating Lagrange multiplier aggregates that are\nrequired for coupling structural equilibrium equations with contact constraints\nand (ii) a review of saddle point smoothers in the context of constrained\ninterface problems. The new interface aggregation strategy perfectly fits into\nan aggregation-based multigrid framework and can easily be combined with\nsegregated transfer operators, which allow to preserve the saddle point\nstructure on the coarse levels. Further analysis provides insight into saddle\npoint smoothers applied to contact problems, while numerical experiments\nillustrate the robustness of the new method. We have implemented the proposed\nalgorithm within the MueLu package of the open-source Trilinos project.\nNumerical examples demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in complex\ndynamic contact problems as well as its scalability up to 23.9 million unknowns\non 480 MPI ranks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 08:15:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 16:03:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 10:57:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 09:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

What's worse, the degradation of previously learned skills becomes\nmore severe as the task sequence increases, known as the long-term catastrophic\nforgetting. It is due to two facts: first, as the model learns more tasks, the\nintersection of the low-error parameter subspace satisfying for these tasks\nbecomes smaller or even does not exist; second, when the model learns a new\ntask, the cumulative error keeps increasing as the model tries to protect the\nparameter configuration of previous tasks from interference. Inspired by the\nmemory consolidation mechanism in mammalian brains with synaptic plasticity, we\npropose a confrontation mechanism in which Adversarial Neural Pruning and\nsynaptic Consolidation (ANPyC) is used to overcome the long-term catastrophic\nforgetting issue. The neural pruning acts as long-term depression to prune\ntask-irrelevant parameters, while the novel synaptic consolidation acts as\nlong-term potentiation to strengthen task-relevant parameters. During the\ntraining, this confrontation achieves a balance in that only crucial parameters\nremain, and non-significant parameters are freed to learn subsequent tasks.\nANPyC avoids forgetting important information and makes the model efficient to\nlearn a large number of tasks. Specifically, the neural pruning iteratively\nrelaxes the current task's parameter conditions to expand the common parameter\nsubspace of the task; the synaptic consolidation strategy, which consists of a\nstructure-aware parameter-importance measurement and an element-wise parameter\nupdating strategy, decreases the cumulative error when learning new tasks.

Due to supplementary non-classical damping of the TMDs, the system\nidentification of MDoF+TMD systems disposes a challenge, in particular, in case\nof sudden events. This identification methods may be helpful for structural\nhealth monitoring of MDoF structures controlled by TMDs. A new adaptation\nformulation of the unscented Kalman filter allows the identification method to\ntrack abrupt stiffness changes. The paper, firstly, describes the theoretical\nbackground of the proposed system identification method and afterwards presents\nthree parametric studies regarding the performance of the method. The first\nstudy shows the augmented state identification by the presented system\nidentification method applied on a MDoF+TMD system. In this study, the abrupt\nstiffness changes of the system are successfully detected and localized under\nearthquake, impulse and white noise excitations. The second study investigates\nthe effects of the state covariance and its relevance for the system\nidentification of MDoF+TMD systems. The results of this study show the\nnecessity of an adaptive definition of the state covariance as applied in the\nproposed method. The third study investigates the effects of modeling on the\nperformance of the identification method. Mathematical models with\ndiscretization of different orders of convergence and system noise levels are\nstudied. The results show that, in particular, MDoF+TMD systems require higher\norder mathematical models for an accurate identification of abrupt changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 09:56:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2019 10:16:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 17:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

A powerful causal inference framework\nis required to tackle these challenges, which plague most data analysis to\nvarying degrees.

Eight lensed quasars are doubly imaged with source redshifts\nbetween 0.99 and 2.90, one is triply imaged by a group (DESJ0345-2545,\n$z=1.68$), and one is quadruply imaged (quad: DESJ0053-2012, $z=3.8$). Singular\nisothermal ellipsoid models for the doubles, based on high-resolution imaging\nfrom SAMI on SOAR or NIRC2 on Keck, give total magnifications between 3.2 and\n5.6, and Einstein radii between 0.49 and 1.97 arcseconds.

By measuring the reduced ${\\chi}^2$ associated with fitting all\nepochs to the same magnitude, we find a simple cut on the less variable\ncomponent that retains all confirmed lensed quasars, while removing 94 per cent\nof contaminant systems with stellar components.

Yet the function of FliI6-FliJ complex - homologous\nto the F1 ATPase motor - within the flagellar export apparatus remains unclear.\nWe use a simple two-state model adapted from studies of linear molecular motors\nto identify key features of this motor. The two states are the 'locked' ground\nstate where the FliJ coiled coil filament experiences fluctuations in an\nasymmetric torsional potential, and a 'free' excited state in which FliJ\nundergoes rotational diffusion. Michaelis-Menten kinetics was used to treat\ntransitions between these two states, and obtain the average angular velocity\nof the FliJ filament within the FliI6 stator: ~9.0 rps. The motor was then\nstudied under external counter torque conditions in order to ascertain its\nmaximal power output: Pmax ~42 kBT/s, and the stall torque: ~3 kBT/rad. Two\nmodes of action within the flagellar export apparatus are proposed, in which\nthe motor performs useful work either by continuously 'grinding' through the\nresistive environment, or by exerting equal and opposite stall force on it. In\nboth cases, the resistance is provided by flagellin subunits entering the\nflagellar export channel prior to their unfolding. We therefore propose that\nthe function of the FliI6-FliJ complex is to lower the energy barrier and\ntherefore assist in unfolding of the flagellar proteins before feeding them\ninto the transport channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 12:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

Up to now, the Maxwell equations in nanostructured\nmaterials with spatial dispersion have been solved by the introduction of the\nso-called Additional Boundary Conditions. In this paper, we derive an approach\nwhere non-local effects are studied in a precise and uniquely defined way, thus\nallowing the treatment of all solid-solid interfaces (metals, semiconductors or\ninsulators), as well as solid-vacuum interfaces in the same framework. The\ntheory is based on the derivation of a potential energy for an ensemble of\nelectrons in a given potential, where the deformation of the ensemble is\ntreated as in a solid, including both shear and compressional deformations,\ninstead of a fluid described only by a bulk compressibility like in the\nhydrodynamical approach. The derived classical equation of motion for the\nensemble describes the deformation vector and the corresponding polarization\nvector as an elastodynamic field, including viscous forces, from which a\ngeneralized non-local constitutive equation for the dielectric constant is\nderived. Boundary conditions are identical to that of elastodynamics and they\nemerge in a natural way, without any physical hypothesis outside the current\ndescription, as it is commonly required in other non-local approaches. This\ndescription does not require the discontinuity of any component of the\nelectric, magnetic or polarization fields and, consequently, no bounded\ncurrents or charges are present at the interface, which is a more suitable\ndescription from the microscopic point of view. It is shown that the method\nconverges to the local boundary conditions in the low spatial dispersion limit\nfor insulators and conductors, quantified by means of a parameter defined as\nthe \"characteristic length\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 12:48:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 14:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

Besides adjusting for\nspurious correlation induced from the shared history, the task also requires\nsufficient flexibility and computational efficiency to incorporate multiple\ncontinuous and discrete traits as data size increases. To accomplish this, we\njointly model mixed-type traits by assuming latent parameters for binary\noutcome dimensions at the tips of an unknown tree informed by molecular\nsequences. This gives rise to a phylogenetic multivariate probit model. With\nlarge sample sizes, posterior computation under this model is problematic, as\nit requires repeated sampling from a high-dimensional truncated normal\ndistribution. Current best practices employ multiple-try rejection sampling\nthat suffers from slow-mixing and a computational cost that scales\nquadratically in sample size. We develop a new inference approach that exploits\n1) the bouncy particle sampler (BPS) based on piecewise deterministic Markov\nprocesses to simultaneously sample all truncated normal dimensions, and 2)\nnovel dynamic programming that reduces the cost of likelihood and gradient\nevaluations for BPS to linear in sample size. In an application with 535 HIV\nviruses and 24 traits that necessitates sampling from a 12,840-dimensional\ntruncated normal, our method makes it possible to estimate the across-trait\ncorrelation and detect factors that affect the pathogen's capacity to cause\ndisease.

In this paper, we generalize these results by\ndeveloping a systematic study for the cooperation dynamics in fluctuating\nenvironments under the consideration of structured, heterogeneous populations\nwith individual entities subjected to general behavioral rules. Considering\ncomplex network topologies, and a behavioral rule based on generalized\nreciprocity, we perform a detailed analysis of the effect of the underlying\ninteraction structure on the evolutionary stability of cooperation. We find\nthat, in the presence of environmental fluctuations, the cooperation dynamics\ncan lead to the creation of multiple network components, each with distinct\nevolutionary properties.

Non-intrusive\nmethods allow the usage of a given deterministic solver in a black-box manner,\nwhile being embarrassingly parallel.

Moreover, intrusive methods are expected to reach\na given accuracy with a smaller number of unknowns compared to non-intrusive\ntechniques. This effect is amplified in settings with high dimensional\nuncertainty. A downside of intrusive methods is however the need to guarantee\nhyperbolicity of the resulting moment system. In contrast to\nstochastic-Galerkin (SG), the Intrusive Polynomial Moment (IPM) method is able\nto maintain hyperbolicity at the cost of solving an optimization problem in\nevery spatial cell and every time step.

One common\nalternative, in this study denoted as pseudo-3D, is to use a stack of adjacent\nslices as input and produce a prediction for at least the central slice. This\napproach gives the network the possibility to capture 3D spatial information,\nwith only a minor additional computational cost. In this study, we\nsystematically evaluate the segmentation performance and computational costs of\nthis pseudo-3D approach as a function of the number of input slices, and\ncompare the results to conventional end-to-end 2D and 3D CNNs. The standard\npseudo-3D method regards the neighboring slices as multiple input image\nchannels. We additionally evaluate a simple approach where the input stack is a\nvolumetric input that is repeatably convolved in 3D to obtain a 2D feature map.\nThis 2D map is in turn fed into a standard 2D network. We conducted experiments\nusing two different CNN backbone architectures and on five diverse data sets\ncovering different anatomical regions, imaging modalities, and segmentation\ntasks. We found that while both pseudo-3D methods can process a large number of\nslices at once and still be computationally much more efficient than fully 3D\nCNNs, a significant improvement over a regular 2D CNN was only observed for one\nof the five data sets. An analysis of the structural properties of the\nsegmentation masks revealed no relations to the segmentation performance with\nrespect to the number of input slices. The conclusion is therefore that in the\ngeneral case, multi-slice inputs appear to not significantly improve\nsegmentation results over using 2D or 3D CNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 15:26:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 19:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

For a swarm of UAVs, a safe operation can not be guaranteed without\npreventing the UAVs from colliding with one another and with static and\ndynamically appearing, moving obstacles in the flying zone. In this paper, we\npresent an online, collision-free path generation and navigation system for\nswarms of UAVs. The proposed system uses geographical locations of the UAVs and\nof the successfully detected, static and moving obstacles to predict and avoid:\n(1) UAV-to-UAV collisions, (2) UAV-to-static-obstacle collisions, and (3)\nUAV-to-moving-obstacle collisions.

This approach can be used in any fully\nthree dimensional numerical simulation of the dynamics of a system of many\ndeformable bodies. In particular, it allows large eccentricities, large mutual\ninclinations, and it is not limited to quasi-periodic perturbations. It can\ntake into account an extended class of perturbations, such as chaotic motions,\ntransient events, and resonant librations.\n  The results are presented by means of a concrete application: the analysis of\nthe libration of Enceladus. This is done by means of both analytic formulas in\nthe frequency domain and direct numerical simulations. We do not a priori\nassume that Enceladus has a triaxial shape, the eventual triaxiality is a\nconsequence of the satellite motion and its rheology. As a result we obtain an\nanalytic formula for the amplitude of libration that incorporates a new\ncorrection due to the rheology.\n  Our results provide an estimation of the amplitude of libration of the core\nof Enceladus as 0.6% of that of the shell.

With photoacoustic data simulated in a coupled elastic-acoustic\ndomain, we conduct inversions in a purely acoustic domain.

We utilize the Bayesian approximation error approach to\ncompensate for the modelling errors arising from approximating a coupled\nelastic-acoustic domain with a purely fluid domain.

Typical\noperationalizations of Granger causality make a strong assumption that every\ntime point of the effect time series is influenced by a combination of other\ntime series with a fixed time delay. However, the assumption of the fixed time\ndelay does not hold in many applications, such as collective behavior,\nfinancial markets, and many natural phenomena. To address this issue, we\ndevelop variable-lag Granger causality, a generalization of Granger causality\nthat relaxes the assumption of the fixed time delay and allows causes to\ninfluence effects with arbitrary time delays.

In this case, non-targeted\nattack is the last chance to disable AI systems. Thus, in this paper, we\npropose a new attack mechanism which performs the non-targeted attack when the\ntargeted attack fails. Besides, we aim to generate a single adversarial sample\nfor different deployed models of the same task, e.g. image classification\nmodels. Hence, for this practical application, we focus on attacking ensemble\nmodels by dividing them into two groups: easy-to-attack and robust models.

There\nare two distinct possible instability triggers. The first is an instability\nthat is triggered by the planets themselves, with no appreciable influence from\nthe planetesimal disk. Of those, the median instability time is $\\sim4$Myr.\nAmong self-stable systems -- where the planets are locked in a resonant chain\nthat remains stable in the absence of a planetesimal's disk-- our\nself-consistently sculpted planetesimal disks nonetheless trigger a giant\nplanet instability with a median instability time of 37-62 Myr for a reasonable\nrange of migration histories of Jupiter. The simulations that give the latest\ninstability times are those that invoked long-range inward migration of Jupiter\nfrom 15 AU or beyond; however these simulations over-excited the inclinations\nof Kuiper belt objects and are inconsistent with the present-day Solar System.\nWe conclude on dynamical grounds that the giant planet instability is likely to\nhave occurred early in Solar System history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 12:33:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-25"}

To meet these pressing needs, especially in urban\nresearch, we provide open access to a valuable benchmark dataset named \"So2Sat\nLCZ42,\" which consists of local climate zone (LCZ) labels of about half a\nmillion Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image patches in 42 urban agglomerations\n(plus 10 additional smaller areas) across the globe. This dataset was labeled\nby 15 domain experts following a carefully designed labeling work flow and\nevaluation process over a period of six months. As rarely done in other labeled\nremote sensing dataset, we conducted rigorous quality assessment by domain\nexperts. The dataset achieved an overall confidence of 85%. We believe this LCZ\ndataset is a first step towards an unbiased globallydistributed dataset for\nurban growth monitoring using machine learning methods, because LCZ provide a\nrather objective measure other than many other semantic land use and land cover\nclassifications. It provides measures of the morphology, compactness, and\nheight of urban areas, which are less dependent on human and culture.

A forward and a\nreverse shock and a contact discontinuity are self-consistently reproduced. The\nspatial width of the contact discontinuity increases as the angle between the\ndiscontinuity normal and ambient magnetic field decreases. The inner structure\nof the discontinuity shows different profiles between magnetic field and plasma\ndensity, or pressure, which is caused by a non-MHD effect of the local plasma.\nThe region between the two shocks is turbulent. The fluctuations in the\nrelatively dense plasma are compressible and propagating away from the contact\ndiscontinuity, although the fluctuations in the relatively tenuous plasma\ncontain both compressible and incompressible components. The source of the\ncompressible fluctuations in the relatively dense plasma is in the relatively\ntenuous plasma. Only compressible fast mode fluctuations generated in the\nrelatively tenuous plasma are transmitted through the contact discontinuity and\npropagate in the relatively dense plasma. These fast mode fluctuations are\nsteepened when passing the contact discontinuity. This wave steepening and\nprobably other effects may cause the broadening of the wave spectrum in the\nvery local interstellar medium plasma. The results are discussed in the context\nof the heliospheric boundary region or heliopause.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 00:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

In this he was strongly influenced by William\nThomson (Lord Kelvin), who was so impressed by Helmholtz's proof of the\nconservation of circulation (\"Wirbelbewegung\") in fluid vortices that he\ndeveloped an entire theory of atoms as knotted vortices in the ether fluid.\nSkyrme liked mechanical models, as did Kelvin, and he grew up fascinated by the\ningenuity of Kelvin's machine for predicting tides, an example of which stood\nin his grandfather's house. This seems to have been connected to his strong\npreference for bosonic fields, which have a classical limit, over fermionic\nfields which do not. I then sketch the progress of Skyrme's ideas in the series\nof six papers in the years 1958-62, which passed largely unnoticed at the time.\nI emphasize his remarkable intuition that the kink solution of the classical\nSine-Gordon equation would be a fermion when quantized, and the novelty of his\nidentification of the Skyrmion winding number with baryon number in the\nthree-dimensional case.
