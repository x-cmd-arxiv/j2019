These spikes are a significant issue for the\ndevelopment of magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)-based memory and molecular\nspintronics devices, microelectronics, and micro-electro-mechanical systems\nbecause they influence the properties of the other films deposited on the top.\nOur molecular spintronics devices that utilize MTJ as the testbed are almost\nshort-lived and encountered high background current that masked the effect of\nmolecular transport channels placed along the sides of MTJs. Therefore, tapered\nthin film edges are critically needed in devices. Here, we report a very\ncost-efficient and fast way of creating an optimum photoresist profile for the\nproduction of spike-free patterned films. This approach is based on performing\na soaking in the photoresist developer after baking and before the UV exposure.\nHowever, the success of this method depends on multiple factors accounted for\nduring photolithography - photoresist thickness (spin speed), baking\ntemperature, soaking time and exposure time. Our recent experiments\nsystematically studied the effect of these factors by following the L9\nexperimental scheme of the Taguchi Design of the experiment (TDOE). We\ndiscovered that baking temperature was the most influential parameter; presoak\ntime and photoresist thickness were two other influential factors; exposure\ntime was the least effective factor. We also found that 4000 rpm, 100 C soft\nbaking, 60 s soaking, and 15 s UV exposure yielded the best results. Finally,\nthe paper also discusses the interdependence of selected factors, and the\nimpact of the individual levels of each factor. This study is expected to\nbenefit MEMS and micro/nanoelectronics device researchers because it attempts\nat finding a cheaper and faster alternative to creating an optimum photoresist\nprofile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2019 16:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

In\nparticular, an observer on a planet orbiting at distance $r=100$ Schwarzschild\nradii from a maximally rotating Kerr SMBH with mass $M_\\bullet = 1\\times\n10^8\\,M_\\odot$ in a plane slightly outside the equator of the latter, would see\nthe gravitationally lensed accretion disk the same size as the Sun as seen from\nthe Earth. Moreover, the accretion rate might be imagined to be set in such a\nway that the apparent disk's temperature would be identical to that of the\nsolar surface. We demonstrate that the post-Newtonian (pN) de Sitter and\nLense--Thirring precessions of the spin axis of such a world would rapidly\nchange, among other things, its tilt, $\\varepsilon$, to its orbital plane by\ntens to hundreds of degrees over a time span of, say, just $\\Delta t\n=400\\,\\mathrm{yr}$, strongly depending on the obliquity $\\eta_\\bullet$ of the\nSMBH's spin to the orbital plane. Thus, such relativistic features would have\nper se a relevant impact on the long-term habitability of the considered\nplanet. Other scenarios are examined as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2019 16:45:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 15:32:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 18:36:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 12:53:20 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 13:47:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

However, current state-of-the-art approaches lack the ability to\nproduce satisfactory high-resolution and accurate subject-specific images. In\nthis work, we present a deep learning framework, namely 4D-Degenerative\nAdversarial NeuroImage Net (4D-DANI-Net), to generate high-resolution,\nlongitudinal MRI scans that mimic subject-specific neurodegeneration in ageing\nand dementia. 4D-DANI-Net is a modular framework based on adversarial training\nand a set of novel spatiotemporal, biologically-informed constraints. To ensure\nefficient training and overcome memory limitations affecting such\nhigh-dimensional problems, we rely on three key technological advances: i) a\nnew 3D training consistency mechanism called Profile Weight Functions (PWFs),\nii) a 3D super-resolution module and iii) a transfer learning strategy to\nfine-tune the system for a given individual. To evaluate our approach, we\ntrained the framework on 9852 T1-weighted MRI scans from 876 participants in\nthe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset and held out a separate\ntest set of 1283 MRI scans from 170 participants for quantitative and\nqualitative assessment of the personalised time series of synthetic images.

Estimating the\ntemperature rise of anisotropic layered structures under surface heating is\ncritically important to make sure that the temperature rise is not too high to\nalias the signals in these experiments. However, a simple formula to estimate\nthe temperature rise in three-dimensional (3D) anisotropic layered systems\nheated by a non-circular laser beam is not available yet, which is the main\nproblem we aim to solve in this work. We first re-derived general formalisms of\nthe temperature rise of a multilayered structure based on the previous\nliterature work by solving the 3D anisotropic heat diffusion equation in the\nfrequency domain.

We study the optimization landscape associated with the empirical\nand the population squared risk of the problem. Under the assumption the\nplanted weights are full-rank we obtain the following results. First, we\nestablish that the landscape of the empirical risk admits an \"energy barrier\"\nseparating rank-deficient $W$ from $W^*$: if $W$ is rank deficient, then its\nrisk is bounded away from zero by an amount we quantify. We then couple this\nresult by showing that, assuming number $N$ of samples grows at least like a\npolynomial function of $d$, all full-rank approximate stationary points of the\nempirical risk are nearly global optimum. These two results allow us to prove\nthat gradient descent, when initialized below the energy barrier, approximately\nminimizes the empirical risk and recovers the planted weights in\npolynomial-time. Next, we show that initializing below this barrier is in fact\neasily achieved when the weights are randomly generated under relatively weak\nassumptions. We show that provided the network is sufficiently\noverparametrized, initializing with an appropriate multiple of the identity\nsuffices to obtain a risk below the energy barrier. At a technical level, the\nlast result is a consequence of the semicircle law for the Wishart ensemble and\ncould be of independent interest.

By focusing on systems that contain planets\nthat straddle the radius-valley, one can estimate the minimum-masses of planets\nabove the radius-valley (and thus are assumed to have retained a voluminous\nhydrogen/helium envelope). This minimum-mass is estimated by assuming that the\nplanet below the radius-valley entirely lost its initial hydrogen/helium\nenvelope, then calculating how massive any planet above the valley needs to be\nto retain its envelope. We apply this method to 104 planets above the radius\ngap in 73 systems for which precise enough radii measurements are available. We\nfind excellent agreement with the photoevaporation model. Only two planets\n(Kepler - 100c & 142c) appear to be inconsistent, suggesting they had a\ndifferent formation history or followed a different evolutionary pathway to the\nbulk of the population. Our method can be used to identify TESS systems that\nwarrant radial-velocity follow-up to further test the photoevaporation model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2019 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In 1979, Parisi and\nSourlas proposed an interesting and powerful conjecture about the infrared\nfixed points with random field type of disorder: such fixed points should\npossess an unusual supersymmetry, by which they reduce in two less spatial\ndimensions to usual non-supersymmetric non-disordered fixed points. This\nconjecture however is known to fail in some simple cases, but there is no\nconsensus on why this happens. In this paper we give new non-perturbative\narguments for dimensional reduction. We recast the problem in the language of\nConformal Field Theory (CFT). We then exhibit a map of operators and\ncorrelation functions from Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetric CFT in $d$ dimensions\nto a $(d-2)$-dimensional ordinary CFT. The reduced theory is local, i.e. it has\na local conserved stress tensor operator. As required by reduction, we show a\nperfect match between superconformal blocks and the usual conformal blocks in\ntwo dimensions lower. This also leads to a new relation between conformal\nblocks across dimensions.

Then, we turn to the analysis of our method and we show, using\nrecent results from the Markov chain literature, that its error can be\nexplicitly bounded with constants which depend polynomially in the dimension\neven in the non-convex setting. This includes the case where the constraints\nare defined via a differentiable neural network. Finally, we present an\nextensive experimental study of the model, including a comparison with\nstate-of-the-art methods and an extension to style transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2019 21:36:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-05"}

Membuster is\nqualitatively different from prior on-chip attacks to enclaves and is more\ndifficult to thwart.\n  We highlight several challenges for Membuster.

A\npopular risk measure is the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), which is commonly\nestimated by averaging observations that occur beyond a quantile at a given\nconfidence level. When this confidence level is very high, this estimation\nmethod can exhibit high variance due to the limited number of samples above the\ncorresponding quantile. To mitigate this problem, extreme value theory can be\nused to derive an estimator for the CVaR that uses extrapolation beyond\navailable samples. This estimator requires the selection of a threshold\nparameter to work well, which is a difficult challenge that has been widely\nstudied in the extreme value theory literature. In this paper, we present an\nestimation procedure for the CVaR that combines extreme value theory and a\nrecently introduced method of automated threshold selection by\n\\cite{bader2018automated}. Under appropriate conditions, we estimate the tail\nrisk using a generalized Pareto distribution. We compare empirically this\nestimation procedure with the commonly used method of sample averaging, and\nshow an improvement in performance for some distributions. We finally show how\nthe estimation procedure can be used in reinforcement learning by applying our\nmethod to the multi-arm bandit problem where the goal is to avoid catastrophic\nrisk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2019 22:19:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 18:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

It is however not until recently that\nthe LDR-HDR transition is recognized as a fundamental change between two DR\nmechanisms. Although the onset of DR, which initiates the LDR stage, is\nexplainable by a general argument of polymers suppressing vortices, the\noccurrence of HDR where flow statistics are qualitatively different and DR\neffects are observed across a much broader range of wall regions remains\nunexplained. Recent development of the vortex axis tracking by iterative\npropagation algorithm allows the detection and extraction of vortex axis-lines\nwith various orientations and curvatures. This new tool is used in this study\nto analyze the vortex conformation and dynamics across the LDR-HDR transition.\nPolymer effects are shown to concentrate on vortices that are partially or\ncompletely attached to the wall. At LDR, this effect is an across-the-board\nweakening of vortices which lowers their intensity without shifting their\ndistribution patterns. At HDR, polymers start to suppress the lift-up of\nstreamwise vortices in the buffer layer and prevent their downstream heads from\nrising into the log-law layer and forming hairpins and other curved vortices.\nThis interrupts the turbulent momentum transfer between the buffer and log-law\nlayers, which offers a clear pathway for explaining the distinct mean flow\nprofiles at HDR. The study depicts the first clear physical picture regarding\nthe changing vortex dynamics between LDR and HDR, which is based on direct\nevidence from objective statistical analysis of vortex conformation and\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2019 22:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-31"}

While\ncontrolling and probing the dynamics of DWs in AFMs remains challenging, the\nfast motion of DWs with velocities around 1500 m/s has been demonstrated in\nmetallic FIMs. The velocity of DWs in metallic FIMs is, however, suppressed by\nthe magnetic damping of conduction electrons, which motivates us to explore how\nfast DWs can move in insulating FIMs where the conduction electron is absent.\nIn this work, through synthesizing compensated FIM insulator Gd3Fe5O12 thin\nfilms with a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, we demonstrate that the\nspin-orbit torque (SOT) induced motion of DWs along the Gd3Fe5O12/Pt racetrack\ncan approach 6000 m/s.

However, because of the end-to-end training,\nan AED model is usually trained with speech-text paired data. It is challenging\nto incorporate external text-only data into AED models. Another issue of the\nAED model is that it does not use the right context of a text token while\npredicting the token. To alleviate the above two issues, we propose a unified\nmethod called LST (Learn Spelling from Teachers) to integrate knowledge into an\nAED model from the external text-only data and leverage the whole context in a\nsentence. The method is divided into two stages. First, in the representation\nstage, a language model is trained on the text. It can be seen as that the\nknowledge in the text is compressed into the LM. Then, at the transferring\nstage, the knowledge is transferred to the AED model via teacher-student\nlearning. To further use the whole context of the text sentence, we propose an\nLM called causal cloze completer (COR), which estimates the probability of a\ntoken, given both the left context and the right context of it. Therefore, with\nLST training, the AED model can leverage the whole context in the sentence.\nDifferent from fusion based methods, which use LM during decoding, the proposed\nmethod does not increase any extra complexity at the inference stage.

We argue that the two tendencies are comparable in strength,\nyet the one towards pairing is stronger, and the ground state is a\nsuperconductor.

Designing incentive-compatible incentive mechanisms is\nnotoriously challenging, however. As a result, most public blockchains today\nuse incentive mechanisms whose security properties are poorly understood and\nlargely untested. In this work, we propose SquirRL, a framework for using deep\nreinforcement learning to analyze attacks on blockchain incentive mechanisms.\nWe demonstrate SquirRL's power by first recovering known attacks: (1) the\noptimal selfish mining attack in Bitcoin [52], and (2) the Nash equilibrium in\nblock withholding attacks [16]. We also use SquirRL to obtain several novel\nempirical results. First, we discover a counterintuitive flaw in the widely\nused rushing adversary model when applied to multi-agent Markov games with\nincomplete information. Second, we demonstrate that the optimal selfish mining\nstrategy identified in [52] is actually not a Nash equilibrium in the\nmulti-agent selfish mining setting. In fact, our results suggest (but do not\nprove) that when more than two competing agents engage in selfish mining, there\nis no profitable Nash equilibrium. This is consistent with the lack of observed\nselfish mining in the wild. Third, we find a novel attack on a simplified\nversion of Ethereum's finalization mechanism, Casper the Friendly Finality\nGadget (FFG) that allows a strategic agent to amplify her rewards by up to 30%.\nNotably, [10] show that honest voting is a Nash equilibrium in Casper FFG: our\nattack shows that when Casper FFG is composed with selfish mining, this is no\nlonger the case.

We find that one of the spin-split energy bands\nin the interface has an upper bound, resulting in an enhancement of the\nEdelstein and inverse Edelstein effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 05:40:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Prior works\non IRS mainly rely on the instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI),\nwhich, however, is practically difficult to obtain for IRS-associated links due\nto its passive operation and large number of elements. To overcome this\ndifficulty, we propose in this paper a new two-timescale (TTS) transmission\nprotocol to maximize the achievable average sum-rate for an IRS-aided multiuser\nsystem under the general correlated Rician channel model. Specifically, the\npassive IRS phase-shifts are first optimized based on the statistical CSI\n(S-CSI) of all links, which varies much slowly as compared to their I-CSI,\nwhile the transmit beamforming/precoding vectors at the access point (AP) are\nthen designed to cater to the I-CSI of the users' effective channels with the\noptimized IRS phase-shifts, thus significantly reducing the channel training\noverhead and passive beamforming complexity over the existing schemes based on\nthe I-CSI of all channels. For the single-user case, a novel penalty dual\ndecomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is proposed, where the IRS phase-shifts are\nupdated in parallel to reduce the computational time. For the multiuser case,\nwe propose a general TTS optimization algorithm by constructing a quadratic\nsurrogate of the objective function, which cannot be explicitly expressed in\nclosed-form.

The downstream development of the basic flow and its stability\nare addressed with an approximate formulation that takes advantage of the jet\nslenderness. The base flow is seen to depend on two parameters, namely a Stokes\nnumber, $G=Re/Fr$, and a Weber number, $We=\\rho\\,Q^2/(\\pi^2\\,\\sigma\\,a^3)$,\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the surface tension coefficient, while its linear stability\ndepends also on the Reynolds number. When non-parallel terms are retained in\nthe local stability problem, the analysis predicts a critical value of the\nWeber number, $We_c(G,Re)$, below which a pocket of local absolute instability\nexists within the near field of the jet. The function $We_c(Re)$ is computed\nfor the buoyancy-free jet, showing marked differences with the results\npreviously obtained with uniform velocity profiles. It is seen that, in\naccounting for gravity effects, it is more convenient to express the parametric\ndependence of the critical Weber number with use made of the Morton and Bond\nnumbers, $Mo=\\nu^4 \\rho^3 g/\\sigma^3$ and $Bo=\\rho g a^2/\\sigma$, as\nreplacements for $G$ and $Re$. This alternative formulation is advantageous to\ndescribe jets of a given liquid for a known value of $g$, in that the resulting\nMorton number becomes constant, thereby leaving $Bo$ as the only relevant\nparameter.

On a\nsubgalactic scale, we report a stronger correlation between $A_{V,star}$ and\n$A_{V,gas}$ for more active HII regions. The local $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ is\nfound to have moderate nonlinear correlations with three tracers of diffuse\nionized gas (DIG), as well as indicators of gas-phase metallicity and\nionization. The DIG regions tend to have larger $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ compared\nto classic HII regions excited by young OB stars.

Mainstream process\nmining tools are designed for intra-organizational settings, insofar as they\nassume that an event log is available for processing as a whole.

The proposal leverages an existing platform for secure\nmulti-party computation, namely Sharemind.

However,\nvarious countries have now introduced data privacy regulations that make it\nmandatory to anonymize any data before releasing it. This makes it difficult to\nlook for patterns as the existing mining techniques may not be directly\napplicable over anonymized data. User locations in an activity-trajectory\ndataset are anonymized to regions of different shapes and sizes making them\nuncomparable; therefore, it is unclear how to define suitable patterns over\nthose regions.

Such\nshocks can result in electron acceleration and subsequent radio emission in the\nform of a type II radio burst. However, the early-phase evolution of shock\nproperties and its relationship to type II burst evolution is still subject to\ninvestigation. Here we study the evolution of a CME-driven shock by comparing\nthree commonly used methods of calculating the Alfv\\'en Mach number ($M_A$),\nnamely: shock geometry, a comparison of CME speed to a model of the coronal\nAlfv\\'en speed, and the type II band-splitting method. We applied the three\nmethods to the 2017 September 2 event, focusing on the shock wave observed in\nextreme ultraviolet (EUV) by the Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI) on board\nGOES-16, in white-light by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph\n(LASCO) on board SOHO, and the type II radio burst observed by the Irish Low\nFrequency Array (I-LOFAR). We show that the three different methods of\nestimating shock $M_A$ yield consistent results and provide a means of relating\nshock property evolution to the type II emission duration. The type II radio\nemission emerged from near the nose of the CME when $M_A$ was in the range\n1.4-2.4 at a heliocentric distance of $\\sim$1.6 $R_\\odot$. The emission ceased\nwhen the CME nose reached $\\sim$2.4 $R_\\odot$, despite an increasing Alfv\\'en\nMach number (up to 4). We suggest the radio emission cessation is due to the\nlack of quasi-perpendicular geometry at this altitude, which inhibits efficient\nelectron acceleration and subsequent radio emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 09:35:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 10:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

In particular, we\nestimate an initial hand pose from a parametric hand model as a prior of hand\nstructure, which regularizes the inference of the structural deformation in the\nprior pose for accurate graph representation learning via residual graph\nconvolution. To optimize the hand structure further, we propose two\nbone-constrained loss functions, which characterize the morphable structure of\nhand poses explicitly. Also, we introduce an adversarial learning framework\nconditioned on the input image with a multi-source discriminator, which imposes\nthe structural constraints onto the distribution of generated 3D hand poses for\nanthropomorphically valid hand poses.

An inner structure of an object is assumed\nto follow the laws of Manhattan World i.e. the majority of line segments are\naligned with two orthogonal directions of the object. For that purpose we\nintroduce the method that estimates the position of two vanishing points\ncorresponding to the main object directions. It is based on an original\noptimization function of segments that estimates a vanishing point position.\nFor calculation of the rectification homography with two vanishing points we\npropose a new method based on estimation of the camera rotation so that the\ncamera axis is perpendicular to the object plane. The proposed method can be\napplied for rectification of various objects such as documents or building\nfacades. Also since the camera rotation is estimated the method can be employed\nfor estimation of object orientation (for example, during a surgery with\nradiograph of osteosynthesis implants). The method was evaluated on the\nMIDV-500 dataset containing projectively distorted images of documents with\ncomplex background. According to the experimental results an accuracy of the\nproposed method is better or equal to the-state-of-the-art if the background\noccupies no more than half of the image.

Indeed, we\ndefine two resource aware type systems, named U and E, for a lambda-calculus\nequipped with pairs for both patterns and terms. Our typing systems borrow some\nbasic ideas from [BKRDR15], which characterises (head) normalisation in a\nqualitative way, in the sense that typability and normalisation coincide. But\nin contrast to [BKRDR15], our (static) systems also provides quantitative\ninformation about the dynamics of the calculus. Indeed, system U provides upper\nbounds for the length of normalisation sequences plus the size of their\ncorresponding normal forms, while system E, which can be seen as a refinement\nof system U, produces exact bounds for each of them. This is achieved by means\nof a non-idempotent intersection type system equipped with different technical\ntools. First of all, we use product types to type pairs, instead of the\ndisjoint unions in [BKRDR15], thus avoiding an overlap between \"being a pair\"\nand \"being duplicable\", resulting in an essential tool to reason about\nquantitativity. Secondly, typing sequents in system E are decorated with tuples\nof integers, which provide quantitative information about normalisation\nsequences, notably time (c.f. length) and space (c.f. size). Another key tool\nof system E is that the type system distinguishes between consuming\n(contributing to time) and persistent (contributing to space) constructors.\nMoreover, the time resource information is remarkably refined, because it\ndiscriminates between different kinds of reduction steps performed during\nevaluation, so that beta reduction, substitution and matching steps are counted\nseparately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 11:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-05"}

Here we report\nresults of near-infrared, high-resolution spectroscopic observations of\nCassiopeia A where we detected the pristine circumstellar material of the\nsupernova progenitor. Our observations revealed a strong emission line of iron\n(Fe) from a circumstellar clump that has not yet been processed by the\nsupernova shock wave. A comprehensive analysis of the observed spectra,\ntogether with an HST image, indicates that the majority of Fe in this\nunprocessed circumstellar material is in the gas phase, not depleted onto dust\ngrains as in the general interstellar medium. This result is consistent with a\ntheoretical model of dust condensation in material that is heavily enriched\nwith CNO-cycle products, supporting the idea that the clump originated near the\nHe core of the progenitor. It has been recently found that Type IIb supernovae\ncan result from the explosion of a blue supergiant with a thin hydrogen\nenvelope, and our results support such a scenario for Cassiopeia A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 12:20:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

In most\nexisting deep metric learning techniques, the embedding of an instance is given\nby a feature vector produced by a deep neural network and Euclidean distance or\ncosine similarity defines distances between these vectors. In this paper, we\nstudy deep distributional embeddings of sequences, where the embedding of a\nsequence is given by the distribution of learned deep features across the\nsequence. This has the advantage of capturing statistical information about the\ndistribution of patterns within the sequence in the embedding. When embeddings\nare distributions rather than vectors, measuring distances between embeddings\ninvolves comparing their respective distributions. We propose a distance metric\nbased on Wasserstein distances between the distributions and a corresponding\nloss function for metric learning, which leads to a novel end-to-end trainable\nembedding model. We empirically observe that distributional embeddings\noutperform standard vector embeddings and that training with the proposed\nWasserstein metric outperforms training with other distance functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 12:43:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-05"}

However, the\ninteraction of intense X-ray beams with matter can also induce changes in the\nstructure and dynamics of materials. A reversible and non-destructive beam\ninduced dynamics has recently been observed in X-ray photon correlation\nspectroscopy experiments in some oxide glasses at sufficiently low absorbed\ndoses, and is here investigated in a (Li$_2$O)$_{0.5}$(B$_2$O$_3$)$_{0.5}$\nglass. The characteristic time of this induced dynamics is inversely\nproportional to the intensity of the X-ray beam, with a coefficient that\ndepends on the chemical composition and local structure of the probed glass,\nmaking it a potentially new tool to investigate fundamental properties of a\nlarge class of disordered systems. While the exact mechanisms behind this\nphenomenon are yet to be elucidated, we report here on the measurement of the\nexchanged wave-vector (and thus length-scale) dependence of the characteristic\ntime of this induced dynamics, and show that it follows the same power-law\nobserved in vitreous silica. This supports the idea that a unique explanation\nfor this effect in different oxide glasses should be looked for.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 13:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-05"}

Based on the presence\nor absence of a direct link between BD and receiver, two protocols, namely\ntransmit-backscatter (TB) protocol and transmit-backscatter-relay (TBR)\nprotocol, are proposed to utilize the UAV to assist the BD. In particular, we\nformulate the system throughput maximization problems for the two protocols by\njointly optimizing the time allocation, reflection coefficient and UAV\ntrajectory. Different static/dynamic circuit power consumption models for the\ntwo protocols are analyzed. The resulting optimization problems are shown to be\nnon-convex, which are challenging to solve. We first consider the dynamic\ncircuit power consumption model, and decompose the original problems into three\nsub-problems, namely time allocation optimization with fixed UAV trajectory and\nreflection coefficient, reflection coefficient optimization with fixed UAV\ntrajectory and time allocation, and UAV trajectory optimization with fixed\nreflection coefficient and time allocation. Then, an efficient iterative\nalgorithm is proposed for both protocols by leveraging the block coordinate\ndescent method and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. In\naddition, for the static circuit power consumption model, we obtain the optimal\ntime allocation with a given reflection coefficient and UAV trajectory and the\noptimal reflection coefficient with low computational complexity by using the\nLagrangian dual method.

We consider a\nscenario in which each hospital has its own genomic dataset and the goal of a\nphysician (or researcher) is to search for a patient similar to a given one\n(based on a genomic makeup) among all the hospitals in the system. To enable\nthis search, we let each hospital encrypt its dataset with its own key and\noutsource the storage of its dataset to a public cloud. The physician can get\nauthorization from multiple hospitals and send a query to the cloud, which\nefficiently performs the search across authorized hospitals using a\nprivacy-preserving index structure. We propose a hierarchical index structure\nto index each hospital's dataset with low memory requirements. Furthermore, we\ndevelop a novel privacy-preserving index merging mechanism that generates a\ncommon search index from individual indices of each hospital to significantly\nimprove the search efficiency. We also consider the storage of medical\ninformation associated with genomic data of a patient (e.g., diagnosis and\ntreatment). We allow access to this information via a fine-grained access\ncontrol policy that we develop through the combination of standard symmetric\nencryption and ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption.

Dynamic loop self-scheduling (DLS) techniques are used to parallelize\nand to balance the load during the execution of such applications. Load\nimbalance arises from variations in the loop iteration (or tasks) execution\ntimes, caused by problem, algorithmic, or systemic characteristics. The\nvariations in systemic characteristics are referred to as perturbations, and\ncan be caused by other applications or processes that share the same resources,\nor a temporary system fault or malfunction. Therefore, the selection of the\nmost efficient DLS technique is critical to achieve the best application\nperformance. The following question motivates this work: Given an application,\nan HPC system, and their characteristics and interplay, which DLS technique\nwill achieve improved performance under unpredictable perturbations? Existing\nstudies focus on variations in the delivered computational speed only as the\nsource of perturbations in the system. However, perturbations in available\nnetwork bandwidth or latency are inevitable on production HPC systems. A\nSimulator-assisted scheduling (SimAS) is introduced as a new\ncontrol-theoretic-inspired approach to dynamically select DLS techniques that\nimprove the performance of applications executing on heterogeneous HPC systems\nunder perturbations. The present work examines the performance of seven\napplications on a heterogeneous system under all the above system\nperturbations. SimAS is evaluated as a proof of concept using native and\nsimulative experiments. The performance results confirm the original hypothesis\nthat no single DLS technique can deliver the absolute best performance in all\nscenarios, whereas the SimAS-based DLS selection resulted in improved\napplication performance in most experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 15:17:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-05"}

By applying helioseismic ring-diagram analysis and granulation\ntracking to SDO/HMI observations, we compute maps of the radial vorticity of\nflows in the upper solar convection zone (down to depths of more than $16$ Mm).\nWe use a Fourier transform in longitude to separate the different azimuthal\norders m in the range $3 \\le m \\le 15$.

We then\nstudy the horizontal and radial dependences of the radial vorticity\neigenfunctions. The horizontal eigenfunctions are complex. As observed\npreviously, the real part peaks at the equator and switches sign near $\\pm\n30^\\circ$, thus the eigenfunctions show significant non-sectoral contributions.\nThe imaginary part is smaller than the real part.

The\namplitude of the radial eigenfunctions decreases by about $10\\%$ from the\nsurface down to $8$ Mm (the region where ring-diagram analysis is most\nreliable, as seen by comparing with the rotation rate measured by global-mode\nseismology). The radial dependence of the radial vorticity eigenfunctions\ndeduced from ring-diagram analysis is consistent with a power-law down to $8$\nMm and is unreliable at larger depths. However, the observations provide only\nweak constraints on the power-law exponents.

We show\nthat this convolution product is well defined for a large class of Volterra\npaths, and we provide an analogue of the extension theorem from the theory of\nrough paths (which guarantees in particular the existence of a Volterra\nsignature). Moreover the concept of convolution product is essential in the\nconstruction of Volterra controlled paths, which is the natural class of\nprocesses to be integrated with respect to the driving noise in our situation.\nThis leads to a rough integral given as a functional of the Volterra signature\nand the Volterra controlled paths, combined through the convolution product.\nThe rough integral is then used in the construction of solutions to Volterra\nequations driven by H\\\"older noises with singular kernels.

The mechanisms behind mark spreading and maintenance are not yet\nfully understood, and current models often assume a long-range infection-like\nprocess for the dynamics of marks, due to the polymeric nature of the chromatin\nfibre which allows looping between distant sites. While these existing models\ntypically consider antagonising marks, here we propose a qualitatively\ndifferent scenario which analyses the spreading of a single mark. We define a\n1D stochastic model in which mark spreading/infection occurs as a long-range\nprocess whereas mark erasure/recovery is a local process, with an enhanced rate\nat boundaries of infected domains. In the limiting case where our model\nexhibits absorbing states, we find a first-order-like transition separating the\nmarked/infected phase from the unmarked/recovered phase. This suggests that our\nmodel, in this limit, belongs to the long-range compact directed percolation\nuniversality class. The abrupt nature of the transition is retained in a more\nbiophysically realistic situation when a basal infection/recovery rate is\nintroduced (thereby removing absorbing states). Close to the transition there\nis a range of bistability where both the marked/infected and unmarked/recovered\nstates are metastable and long lived, which provides a possible avenue for\ncontrolling fate decisions in cells. Increasing the basal infection/recovery\nrate, we find a second transition between a coherent (marked or unmarked)\nphase, and a mixed, or random, one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 13:45:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 12:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

Given the typical resolutions of these historical\nsatellite data, we observe that there is inherent variation in the visibility\nof different road types. Based on this observation, we propose two deep\nlearning frameworks that extend state-of-the-art deep learning methods by\nformalizing road detection as an ordinal classification task. In contrast to\nrelated schemes, one of the two models also resorts to satellite time series\ndata that are potentially affected by missing data and cloud occlusion. Taking\nthese time series data into account eliminates the need to manually curate\ndatasets of high-quality image tiles, substantially simplifying the application\nof such models on a global scale. We evaluate our approaches on a dataset that\nis based on Sentinel~2 satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap vector data. Our\nresults indicate that the proposed models can successfully identify large and\nmedium-sized roads. We also discuss opportunities and challenges related to the\ndetection of roads and other infrastructure on a global scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 15:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-12"}

Whereas in\nmachine learning, \"sparsity\" is related to a penalty term that leads to some\nconnecting weights becoming small or zero, in biological brains, sparsity is\noften created when high spiking thresholds prevent neuronal activity. Here we\nintroduce sparsity into a reservoir computing network via neuron-specific\nlearnable thresholds of activity, allowing neurons with low thresholds to\ncontribute to decision-making but suppressing information from neurons with\nhigh thresholds. This approach, which we term \"SpaRCe\", optimises the sparsity\nlevel of the reservoir without affecting the reservoir dynamics. The read-out\nweights and the thresholds are learned by an on-line gradient rule that\nminimises an error function on the outputs of the network. Threshold learning\noccurs by the balance of two opposing forces: reducing inter-neuronal\ncorrelations in the reservoir by deactivating redundant neurons, while\nincreasing the activity of neurons participating in correct decisions. We test\nSpaRCe on classification problems and find that threshold learning improves\nperformance compared to standard reservoir computing. SpaRCe alleviates the\nproblem of catastrophic forgetting, a problem most evident in standard echo\nstate networks and recurrent neural networks in general, due to increasing the\nnumber of task-specialised neurons that are included in the network decisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 15:05:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 17:51:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 16:25:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 2021 05:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-19"}
