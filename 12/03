Frequency microcombs, aided by their high-quality resonances\nand inherent third-order nonlinear susceptibility, have demonstrated remarkable\nimpact in frequency metrology and synthesis. However, microcombs are often with\nlimited spectral bandwidth bounded by the intrinsic second-order chromatic\ndispersion and the consequently low intensities at the spectral edges. To\nenhance the applications of frequency combs, a spectrally-broad comb generation\nscheme is often desired. Here we report coherent satellite clusters in\nmulti-spectral regenerative frequency microcombs with enhanced intensities at\nthe octave points and engineered frequency span. Beyond the conventional\nbandwidth of parametric oscillation, the regenerative satellites are\nfacilitated by higher-order dispersion control allowing for\nmulti-phase-matching in the microcavities. The frequency span of the\nmulti-spectral regenerative satellites is deterministically controlled from 57\nTHz to 126 THz by pumping at C- and L- bands. We demonstrate that the\nregenerative satellite preserves the coherence with the central comb through\nthe nonlinear parametric process. We further show the mirrored appearance of\nthe satellite transition dynamics including each comb state that are\nsimultaneously observed at the central comb. These multi-spectral regenerative\nsatellites extend the scope of parametric-based frequency combs and provide a\nunique platform with wide applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 16:06:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

Equivalently, a Galois\nextension with Galois group $\\Gamma$ has no Hopf-Galois structures of type $G$.\n  Our method relies on the alternate brace operation $\\circ$ on $G$, which we\nuse mainly indirectly, that is, in terms of the functions $\\gamma : G \\to\n\\Aut(G)$ defined by $g \\mapsto (x \\mapsto (x \\circ g) \\cdot g^{-1})$. These\nfunctions are in one-to-one correspondence with the regular subgroups of the\nholomorph of $G$, and are characterised by the functional equation\n$\\gamma(g^{\\gamma(h)} \\cdot h) = \\gamma(g) \\gamma(h)$, for $g, h \\in G$. We\ndevelop methods to deal with these functions, with the aim of making their\nenumeration easier, and more conceptual.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 16:27:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 15:51:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 17:27:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 13:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-04"}

As\npart of this framework, we investigate multiple learning approaches for the\nagent with different levels of complexity. The simplest model-confusion-based\nmethod lets the agent ask questions based on its confusion, relying on the\npredefined confidence threshold of a next action prediction model. To build on\nthis confusion-based method, the agent is expected to demonstrate more\nsophisticated reasoning such that it discovers the timing and locations to\ninteract with a human.

The beam domain is first\ndivided into $S$ narrow sectors such that each sector contains $D$ DFT beams.\nThen, so-called deterministic equivalents are computed for the\namplitude-projection of the optimal MMSE vectors into each sector in asymptotic\nregime where $N$ , $K$ and $D$ grow large with a non-trivial ratio $N/K = C$\nand $N/D = S$. Given the approximations for the sector-specific values, the\nstructure and dimension of each UE specific OBF vector are optimized based on\nthe statistical channel properties and the amount of overlap among users in\nangular domain. The numerical analysis shows that the attained SINR values\nclosely follow the optimal MMSE receiver while the computational burden is\ngreatly reduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 16:48:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

Theories typically define such states\nusing gauge fields and deconfined quasiparticle excitations that emerge from a\nsimple rule governing the local ground state of a frustrated magnet. For\nexample, the '2-in-2-out' ice rule for dipole moments on a tetrahedron can lead\nto a quantum spin ice in rare-earth pyrochlores - a state described by a\nlattice gauge theory of quantum electrodynamics$^{2-4}$. However, f-electron\nions often carry multipole degrees of freedom of higher rank than dipoles,\nleading to intriguing behaviours and 'hidden' orders$^{5-6}$. Here we show that\nthe correlated ground state of a Ce$^{3+}$-based pyrochlore, Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$,\nis a quantum liquid of magnetic octupoles. Our neutron scattering results are\nconsistent with the formation of a fluid-like state of matter, but the\nintensity distribution is weighted to larger scattering vectors, which\nindicates that the correlated degrees of freedom have a more complex\nmagnetization density than that typical of magnetic dipoles in a spin liquid.\nThe temperature evolution of the bulk properties in the correlated regime below\n1 Kelvin is well reproduced using a model of dipole-octupole doublets on a\npyrochlore lattice$^{7-8}$. The nature and strength of the octupole-octupole\ncouplings, together with the existence of a continuum of excitations attributed\nto spinons, provides further evidence for a quantum ice of octupoles governed\nby a '2-plus-2-minus' rule. Our work identifies Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ as a unique\nexample of a material where frustrated multipoles form a 'hidden' topological\norder, thus generalizing observations on quantum spin liquids to multipolar\nphases that can support novel types of emergent fields and excitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 16:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-27"}

In this paper, we perform a\ncomprehensive error resilience analysis of DNNs subjected to hardware faults\n(e.g., permanent faults) in the weight memory. The outcome of this analysis is\nleveraged to propose a novel error mitigation technique which squashes the\nhigh-intensity faulty activation values to alleviate their impact. We achieve\nthis by replacing the unbounded activation functions with their clipped\nversions. We also present a method to systematically define the clipping values\nof the activation functions that result in increased resilience of the networks\nagainst faults. We evaluate our technique on the AlexNet and the VGG-16 DNNs\ntrained for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The experimental results show that our\nmitigation technique significantly improves the resilience of the DNNs to\nfaults.

We\nshow that the fastest growing modes of an ideal magnetofluid are\nthree-dimensional provided the shear rate, $S$, is near the two-dimensional\nonset value, $S_c$. For a Keplerian shear, three-dimensional modes are unstable\nabove $S\\approx0.10S_c$, and dominate the two-dimensional modes until\n$S\\approx2.05S_{c}$.

High resolution models perform well, but\ntrain slowly. Low resolution models train faster, but they are inaccurate.\nInspired by multigrid methods in numerical optimization, we propose to use\nvariable mini-batch shapes with different spatial-temporal resolutions that are\nvaried according to a schedule.

However, there are still open questions\nconcerning the rise of the magnetized plasma through the atmosphere, mainly in\nthe chromosphere, where the plasma departs from local thermodynamic equilibrium\n(LTE) and is partially ionized. We aim to investigate the impact of the\nnonequilibrium (NEQ) ionization and recombination and molecule formation of\nhydrogen, as well as ambipolar diffusion, on the dynamics and thermodynamics of\nthe flux emergence process. Using the Bifrost code, we performed 2.5D numerical\nexperiments of magnetic flux emergence from the convection zone up to the\ncorona. The experiments include the NEQ ionization and recombination of atomic\nhydrogen, the NEQ formation and dissociation of H2 molecules, and the ambipolar\ndiffusion term of the Generalized Ohm's Law. Our experiments show that the LTE\nassumption substantially underestimates the ionization fraction in most of the\nemerged region, leading to an artificial increase in the ambipolar diffusion\nand, therefore, in the heating and temperatures as compared to those found when\ntaking the NEQ effects on the hydrogen ion population into account. We see that\nLTE also overestimates the number density of H2 molecules within the emerged\nregion, thus mistakenly magnifying the exothermic contribution of the H2\nmolecule formation to the thermal energy during the flux emergence process. We\nfind that the ambipolar diffusion does not significantly affect the amount of\ntotal unsigned emerged magnetic flux, but it is important in the shocks that\ncross the emerged region, heating the plasma on characteristic times ranging\nfrom 0.1 to 100 s.

This choice\nstreamlines many calculations, especially in the case of null hypersurfaces\nwith arbitrary coordinates, where we show that the spin-1 momentum coincides\nwith the rotational 1-form of isolated horizons.

Surface charges can also be constructed using a\ncohomological prescription: in this case we find that the exact 3-form mismatch\nplays no role, and tetrad and metric charges are equal.

The dependence\nof the X-ray emission on the square of the gas density leads to a predominant\nrole of cool cores in the detection of GCs. The contribution of cool cores to\nthe X-ray luminosity does not scale with GC mass and cosmology and therefore\naffects the use of X-ray GCs in producing cosmological constraints. One of the\nmain science goals of the eROSITA mission is to constrain cosmology with a wide\nX-ray survey. We propose an eROSITA GC detection scheme that avoids the use of\nX-ray GC centers in detection. We calculate theoretical expectations and\ncharacterize the performance of this scheme by simulations. Performing\nrealistic simulations of point sources (PSs) in survey mode we search for\nspatial scales where the extended signal is uncontaminated by the PS flux. We\nderive a combination of scales and thresholds, which result in a clean extended\nsource catalog. We design the output of the GC detection which enables\ncalibrating the core-excised luminosity using external mass measurements. We\nprovide a way to incorporate the results of this calibration in the production\nof final core-excised luminosity. Similarly to other GC detection pipelines, we\nsample the flux - core radius detection space of our method and find many\nsimilarities with the pipeline used in the 400d survey. Both detection methods\nrequire large statistics on compact GCs, in order to reduce the contamination\nfrom PSs. The benefit of our pipeline consists in the sensitivity to the outer\nGC shapes, which are characterized by large core sizes with little GC to GC\nvariation at a fixed total mass. GC detection through cluster outskirts\nimproves the GC characterization using eROSITA survey data and is expected to\nyield well characterized GC catalogs having simple selection functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 19:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 11:29:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

Rather than working with\nthe probability distribution itself, it can instead be convenient to work with\nthe entropies of the observed variables. In the Bell causal structure with two\ninputs and outputs per party, a technique that uses entropic inequalities is\nknown that can always identify non-classical correlations.

This paper primarily focuses on the\nMars year 24 pre-solstice \"A\" storm that starts with many episodes of\nfrontal/flushing dust storms from the northern hemisphere and attains its\nmaximum global mean opacity after dust expansion in the southern hemisphere.\nDuring the development of this storm, the dominant eddies in terms of eddy\nkinetic energy progress from the $1<P\\leq8$ sol eddies in the northern mid/high\nlatitudes to the $P\\leq1$ sol eddies (dominated by thermal tides) in the\nsouthern mid latitudes, and the $8<P\\leq60$ sol eddies show a prominent peak\nwith the increased global-mean dust opacity.

This total and strong version of the Roman domination\nnumber (for graphs) is introduced in this research, and the study of its\nmathematical properties is therefore initiated. For instance, we establish\nupper bounds for such parameter, and relate it with several parameters related\nto vertex domination in graphs, from which we remark the standard domination\nnumber, the total version of the standard domination number and the (strong)\nRoman domination number. In addition, among other results, we show that for any\ntree $T$ of order $n(T)\\ge 3$, with maximum degree $\\Delta(T)$ and $s(T)$\nsupport vertices, $\\gamma_{StR}^t(T)\\ge \\left\\lceil\n\\frac{n(T)+s(T)}{\\Delta(T)}\\right\\rceil+1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 21:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

Then, for a given stabilizing state-feedback of the delay-free\ntruncated model, an LMI-based sufficient condition on the maximum amplitude of\nthe state-delay is employed to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop\nstate-delayed truncated model. Second, we assess the exponential stability of\nthe resulting closed-loop infinite-dimensional system under the assumption that\nthe number of modes of the original infinite-dimensional system captured by the\ntruncated model has been selected large enough. Finally, we consider in our\ncontrol design the possible presence of a distributed perturbation, as well as\nadditive boundary perturbations in the control inputs. In this case, we derive\nfor the closed-loop system an exponential input-to-state estimate with fading\nmemory of the distributed and boundary disturbances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 23:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

In this paper, we propose a new paradigm that estimates uncertainty\nin the model's internal hidden space instead of the model's output space.

Herein we\nreport active analog tuning of the phase of visible light reflected by a\nbismuth-based metamaterial, enabled by a reversible solid-liquid transition.\nThis metamaterial, fabricated by a lithography-free approach, consists of\ntwo-dimensional assemblies of polydisperse plasmonic bismuth nanostructures\nembedded in a refractory and transparent aluminum oxide matrix. Analog tuning\nof the phase is achieved by controlled heating of the metamaterial to melt a\nfraction of the nanostructures. A maximum tuning of 320 deg (1.8pi) is observed\nupon complete melting of the nanostructures at 230 degrees Celsius. This tuning\nis reversible by cooling to 25 degrees Celsius. In addition, it presents a wide\nhysteretic character due to liquid bismuth undercooling. This enables the phase\nachieved by this analog approach to remain stable over a broad temperature\nrange upon cooling and until re-solidification occurs around 100 degrees\nCelsius.

The interaction implies communication between two dyadic agents and, if\nthe type of interaction is physical, the communication is represented by the\nset of forces exchanged during the interaction. Within this context, the role\nof quantifying these forces becomes of pivotal importance for understanding the\ninteraction mechanisms. At the current scientific stage, classical robots are\nbuilt to act for humans, but the scientific demand is going towards the\ndirection of robots that will have to collaborate with humans. This will be\npossible by providing the robots with sufficient pieces of information of the\nagent they are interacting with (i.e., kinematic and dynamic model of the\nhuman). In a modern age where humans need the help of robots, apparently in an\nopposite trend, this thesis attempts to answer the following questions: Do\nrobots need humans? Should robots know their human partners? A tentative answer\nis provided here in the form of a novel framework for the simultaneous human\nwhole-body motion tracking and dynamics estimation, in a real-time scenario.\nThe framework encompasses a set of body-mounted sensors and a probabilistic\nalgorithm able of estimating physical quantities that in humans are not\ndirectly measurable (i.e., torques and internal forces). This thesis is mainly\nfocussed on the paramount role in retrieving the human dynamics estimation but\nstraightforwardly it leaves the door open to the next development step: passing\nthe human dynamics feedback to the robot controllers. This step will enable the\nrobot with the capability to observe and understand the human partner by\ngenerating an enhanced (intentional) interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2019 00:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

Building on the properties of that construction, this paper proves\nthat a general linear prototype graph of order m can be extended using a single\nnew colour to produce a new cyclic graph of order $3m - 1$ which is\ntriangle-free in the new colour, and has the same clique-number as the\nprototype in every other colour.

The\nresulting graphs are linear, as before, and under certain specific conditions\nset out here, they can be cyclic.\n  The mechanism of the new construction requires that the first prototype\ncontains a triangle-free `template' in one colour, with defined properties.\nThis paper shows that in the compound graph, clique numbers in the colours of\nthe first prototype may exceed those of the prototype.

How do values influence what the discipline focuses on and the way it\ndevelops?

This is ideally done using longitudinal\nmeasurements of the mediator, as these capture the mediator process more\nfinely. However, longitudinal measurements pose challenges for mediation\nanalysis. This is because the mediators and outcomes measured at a given\ntime-point can act as confounders for the association between mediators and\noutcomes at a later time-point; these confounders are themselves affected by\nthe prior exposure and outcome. Such post-treatment confounding cannot be dealt\nwith using standard methods (e.g. generalized estimating equations).

Unfortunately, meaningful regions can be difficult to\nestimate, especially since we often have few examples of individuals that\nbelong to a given category. To address this issue, we rely on the fact that\ndifferent categories are often highly interdependent. In particular, categories\noften have conceptual neighbors, which are disjoint from but closely related to\nthe given category (e.g.\\ fruit and vegetable). Our hypothesis is that more\naccurate category representations can be learned by relying on the assumption\nthat the regions representing such conceptual neighbors should be adjacent in\nthe embedding space.

To reduce both intra-\nand cross-modality discrepancies, we propose a Hierarchical Cross-Modality\nDisentanglement (Hi-CMD) method, which automatically disentangles\nID-discriminative factors and ID-excluded factors from visible-thermal images.\nWe only use ID-discriminative factors for robust cross-modality matching\nwithout ID-excluded factors such as pose or illumination.

Investigators have for long attempted to\nestimate landslide hazard to determine where, when, and how destructive\nlandslides are expected to be in an area. This information is useful to design\nlandslide mitigation strategies, and to reduce landslide risk and societal and\neconomic losses. In the geomorphology literature, most attempts at predicting\nthe occurrence of populations of landslides rely on the observation that\nlandslides are the result of multiple interacting, conditioning and triggering\nfactors. Here, we propose a novel Bayesian modelling framework for the\nprediction of space-time landslide occurrences of the slide type caused by\nweather triggers. We consider log-Gaussian cox processes, assuming that\nindividual landslides stem from a point process described by an unknown\nintensity function.

Identifying craters is a challenging task due to their enormous\ndifference in size, large variations in shape and vast presence. Furthermore,\nestimating the age of craters is extraordinarily difficult due to their complex\nand different morphologies.

From an\ninitial small number of available craters, we progressively identify craters\nand estimate their age from Chang'E data by transfer learning (TL) using deep\nneural networks. For comprehensive identification of multi-scale craters, a\ntwo-stage craters detection approach is developed.

In the time domain, the eclipse events are fast and\nweak. This would make their signal difficult to find and recognize in the phase\nlight curve, even for small inclinations when eclipses happen frequently.\nHowever, due to the quasiperiodic nature of the phenomenon, the Fourier\ntransform of the direct reflection signal consists of a double sum of sharp\npeaks. These peaks can be resolved for large close binaries and sufficiently\nlong observation times with a star coronagraph. Eclipses modulate the phase\ncurve, having an orbital period $2\\pi/\\omega$, with a contribution from the\nrelative motion in the binary plane of a period $2\\pi/\\Omega$. This leads to a\nspectral structure with basis frequencies $\\omega$ and $\\Omega$. We aim to\ncharacterize these spectra. We studied the regime of short eclipses that occur\nwhen the planet radii are small compared to the planet separation. We derived\nformulas for the peak amplitudes applicable to homogeneous (Lambertian) planet\nbinaries in circular orbit with small inclination. The effects of an eclipse\nand of double reflection appear as first- and second-order contributions (in\nplanet radius over separation) in the reflection signal respectively. Small\npeaks appear as observable side bands in the spectrum. Identical structures\naround $m\\Omega$ are characteristic of short-duration eclipses. Deceasing side\nbands could indicate double reflection between companions. Fourier analysis of\nthe light curve of non-transiting planets can be used to find planets and their\nmoons. Difficulties in interpreting the structures arise for small planet\nseparation and when there are several moons in mean-motion resonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2019 11:01:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In these settings, we devise a novel depth refinement\nframework that aims at recovering the underlying piece-wise planarity of the\ninverse depth map. We formulate this task as an optimization problem involving\na data fidelity term that minimizes the distance to the input inverse depth\nmap, as well as a regularization that enforces a piece-wise planar solution. As\nfor the regularization term, we model the inverse depth map as a weighted graph\nbetween pixels. The proposed regularization is designed to estimate a plane\nautomatically at each pixel, without any need for an a priori estimation of the\nscene planes, and at the same time it encourages similar pixels to be assigned\nto the same plane. The resulting optimization problem is efficiently solved\nwith ADAM algorithm.

In storage rings, where\nultrarelativistic particles are agglomerated in dense bunches, the measurement\nof their phase-space distribution (PSD) is of paramount importance: at any time\nthe PSD not only determines the complete space-time evolution but also provides\nfundamental performance characteristics for storage ring operation. Here, we\ndemonstrate a non-destructive tomographic imaging technique for the 2D\nlongitudinal PSD of ultrarelativistic electron bunches. For this purpose, we\nutilize a unique setup, which streams turn-by-turn near-field measurements of\nbunch profiles at MHz repetition rates. To demonstrate the feasibility of our\nmethod, we induce a non-equilibrium state and show, that the PSD\nmicrostructuring as well as the PSD dynamics can be observed in great detail\nwith an unprecedented resolution. Our approach offers a pathway to control\nultrashort bunches and supports, as one example, the development of compact\naccelerators with low energy footprints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2019 11:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

In a nanowire axial heterostructure featuring a sharp\ninterface, strain is set by the materials lattice mismatch and the nanowire\nradius. Here, we show that introducing a graded interface in nanowire\nheterostructures offers an additional parameter to control strain. For a given\ninterface length and lattice mismatch, we first derive theoretically the\nmaximum nanowire radius below which coherent growth is possible.

Although recent\nadvances in deep learning have achieved remarkable accuracy in settled scenes,\ni.e., source domain, few works can generalize well on the unseen target domain.\nOne popular solution is assigning unlabeled target images with pseudo labels by\nclustering, and then retraining the model. However, clustering methods tend to\nintroduce noisy labels and discard low confidence samples as outliers, which\nmay hinder the retraining process and thus limit the generalization ability.

This procedure\nencourages that the selected training samples can be both clean and\nmiscellaneous, and that the two models can promote each other iteratively.\nExtensive experiments show that the proposed framework can consistently benefit\nmost clustering-based methods, and boost the state-of-the-art adaptation\naccuracy.

The cones of matrices of bounded factor width\ngive a hierarchy of inner approximations to the PSD cone.

When the forcing pressure amplitude is larger than a certain\ncritical value, the bubble formation process is effectively driven by the\nselected frequency, leading to the formation of nearly monodisperse bubbles\nwhose volume is reduced by increasing the forcing frequency. We reveal the\nexistence of two different breakup modes, M1 and M2, under effective forcing\nconditions. The bubble formation in mode M1 resembles the natural bubbling\nprocess, featuring an initial radial expansion of an air ligament attached to\nthe injector, whose initial length is smaller than the wavelength of a small\ninterfacial perturbation induced by the oscillating air flow rate. The\nexpansion stage is followed by a ligament collapse stage, which begins with the\nformation of an incipient neck that propagates downstream while collapsing\nradially inwards, leading to the pinch-off of a new bubble. These two stages\ntake place faster than in the unforced case as a consequence of the the air\nflow modulation induced by the forcing system. The breakup mode M2 takes place\nwith an intact ligament longer than one disturbance wavelength, whereby the\ninterface already presents a local necking region at pinch-off, and leads to\nthe formation of bubbles from the tip of an elongated air filament without an\nexpansion stage. Scaling laws that provide closed expressions for the bubble\nvolume, the intact ligament length, and the transition from the M1 breakup mode\nto the M2, as functions of the relevant governing parameters, are deduced from\nthe experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2019 14:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

In this paper, we\npresent a new and robust approach for detecting presentation attacks on\nfinger-vein biometric systems exploiting the 3D Shape (normal-map) and material\nproperties (diffuse-map) of the finger. Observing the normal-map and\ndiffuse-map exhibiting enhanced textural differences in comparison with the\noriginal finger-vein image, especially in the presence of varying illumination\nintensity, we propose to employ textural feature-descriptors on both of them\nindependently. The features are subsequently used to compute a separating\nhyper-plane using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers for the features\ncomputed from normal-maps and diffuse-maps independently. Given the scores from\neach classifier for normal-map and diffuse-map, we propose sum-rule based score\nlevel fusion to make detection of such presentation attack more robust. To this\nend, we construct a new database of finger-vein images acquired using a custom\ncapture device with three inbuilt illuminations and validate the applicability\nof the proposed approach.

In order to interpret their origin through comparison with\nremote-sensing observations of the solar eruption, we thus must deconvolve the\ntransport effects due to the turbulent magnetic fields from the SEP\nobservations. Recent research suggests that the SEP propagation is guided by\nthe turbulent meandering of the magnetic fieldlines across the mean magnetic\nfield. However, the lengthening of the distance the SEPs travel, due to the\nfieldline meandering, has so far not been included in SEP event analysis. This\nomission can cause significant errors in estimation of the release times of\nSEPs at the Sun. We investigate the distance travelled by the SEPs by\nconsidering them to propagate along fieldlines that meander around closed\nmagnetic islands that are inherent in turbulent plasma. We introduce a\nfieldline randow walk model which takes into account the physical scales\nassociated to the magnetic islands. Our method remedies the problem of the\ndiffusion equation resulting in unrealistically short pathlengths, and the\nfractal dependence of the pathlength of random walk on the length of the\nrandom-walk step. We find that the pathlength from the Sun to 1 au can be below\nthe nominal Parker spiral length for SEP events taking place at solar\nlongitudes 45E to 60W, whereas the western and behind-the-limb particles can\nexperience pathlengths longer than 2 au due to fieldline meandering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2019 14:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

This work\nproposes distributed age-efficient transmission policies for random access\nchannels with $M$ transmitters. In the first part of this work, we analyze the\nage performance of stationary randomized policies by relating the problem of\nfinding age to the absorption time of a related Markov chain. In the second\npart of this work, we propose the notion of \\emph{age-gain} of a packet to\nquantify how much the packet will reduce the instantaneous age of information\nat the receiver side upon successful delivery. We then utilize this notion to\npropose a transmission policy in which transmitters act in a distributed manner\nbased on the age-gain of their available packets. In particular, each\ntransmitter sends its latest packet only if its corresponding age-gain is\nbeyond a certain threshold which could be computed adaptively using the\ncollision feedback or found as a fixed value analytically in advance. Both\nmethods improve age of information significantly compared to the state of the\nart. In the limit of large $M$, we prove that when the arrival rate is small\n(below $\\frac{1}{eM}$), slotted ALOHA-type algorithms are asymptotically\noptimal. As the arrival rate increases beyond $\\frac{1}{eM}$, while age\nincreases under slotted ALOHA, it decreases significantly under the proposed\nage-based policies.

If there is a resource\navailable, the customer is immediately served and the resource enters an inner\nnetwork. If there is no resource available, the new customer has to wait in an\nexternal queue until one becomes available (\"backordering\"). When a resource\nexits the inner network, it is returned to the resource pool and waits for\nanother customer. In this paper, we present a new solution approach. To\napproximate the inner network with the resource pool of the SOQN, we consider a\nmodification, where newly arriving customers will decide not to join the\nexternal queue and are lost if the resource pool is empty \"lost customers\". We\nprove that we can adjust the arrival rate of the modified system so that the\nthroughputs in each node are pairwise identical to those in the original\nnetwork. We also prove that the probabilities that the nodes with constant\nservice rates are idling are pairwise identical too. Moreover, we provide a\nclosed-form expression for these throughputs and probabilities of idle nodes.\nTo approximate the external queue of the SOQN with backordering, we construct a\nreduced SOQN with backordering, where the inner network consists only of one\nnode, by using Norton's theorem and results from the lost-customers\nmodification. In a final step, we use the closed-form solution of this reduced\nSOQN, to estimate the performance of the original SOQN. We apply our results to\nrobotic mobile fulfilment systems (RMFSs). Instead of sending pickers to the\nstorage area to search for the ordered items and pick them, robots carry\nshelves with ordered items from the storage area to picking stations.

This indicates the low\nnoise tolerance of NNs, which is a major reason for the recent increase of\nadversarial attacks. This is a serious concern, particularly for\nsafety-critical applications, where inaccurate results lead to dire\nconsequences. We propose a novel methodology that leverages model checking for\nthe Formal Analysis of Neural Network (FANNet) under different input noise\nranges. Our methodology allows us to rigorously analyze the noise tolerance of\nNNs, their input node sensitivity, and the effects of training bias on their\nperformance, e.g., in terms of classification accuracy. For evaluation, we use\na feed-forward fully-connected NN architecture trained for the Leukemia\nclassification. Our experimental results show $\\pm 11\\%$ noise tolerance for\nthe given trained network, identify the most sensitive input nodes, and confirm\nthe biasness of the available training dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2019 12:42:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 22:38:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

One theoretically grounded approach is\ntapping the can prior to opening, although this has never been rigorously\nevaluated. We aimed to evaluate the effect of tapping a can of beer on beer\nloss. Methods: Single centre parallel-group randomised controlled trial. 1031\ncans of cans of beer of 330mL were randomised into one of four groups before\nthe experiment: unshaken/untapped (n=256), unshaken/tapped (n=251),\nshaken/untapped (n=249), or shaken/tapped (n=244). The intervention was tapping\nthe can of beer three times on its side with a single finger. We compared\ntapping versus non-tapping for cans that had been shaken for 2 minutes or were\nunshaken. Three teams weighed, tapped or did not tap, opened cans, absorbed any\nbeer loss using paper towels, then re-weighed cans. The teams recorded the mass\nof each can before and after opening with an accuracy of +/-0.01 grams. Main\noutcome measure: The main outcome measure was beer loss (in grams). This was\ncalculated as the difference in the mass of the beer after the can was opened\ncompared to before the can was opened. Results: For shaken cans, there was no\nstatistically significant difference in the mass of beer lost when tapping\ncompared to not tapping (mean difference of -0.159g beer lost with tapping, 95%\nCI -0.36 to 0.04). For unshaken cans, there was also no statistically\nsignificant difference between tapping and not tapping. Conclusion: These\nfindings suggest that tapping shaken beer cans does not prevent beer loss when\nthe container is opened. Thus, the practice of tapping a beer prior to opening\nis unsupported. The only apparent remedy to avoid liquid loss is to wait for\nbubbles to settle before opening the can.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2019 14:18:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 19:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

Compounding on the complex nature of such adverse\nstrategies, credit card fraudulent activities are rare events compared to the\nnumber of legitimate transactions. Hence, the challenge to develop fraud\ndetection that are accurate and efficient is substantially intensified and, as\na consequence, credit card fraud detection has lately become a very active area\nof research. In this work, we provide a survey of current techniques most\nrelevant to the problem of credit card fraud detection. We carry out our survey\nin two main parts.

Pore structures are built using reconstruction methods and\nrepresented as images, and their effective diffusivity is computed by lattice\nBoltzmann (LBM) simulations. The datasets thus generated are used to train\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) models and evaluate their performance. The\ntrained model predicts the effective diffusivity of porous structures with\ncomputational cost orders of magnitude lower than LBM simulations. The\noptimized model performs well on porous media with realistic topology, large\nvariation of porosity (0.28-0.98), and effective diffusivity spanning more than\none order of magnitude (), e.g., >95% of predicted De have truncated relative\nerror of <10% when the true De is larger than 0.2. The CNN model provides\nbetter prediction than the empirical Bruggeman equation, especially for porous\nstructure with small diffusivity. The relative error of CNN predictions,\nhowever, is rather high for structures with De < 0.1. To address this issue,\nthe porosity of porous structures is encoded directly into the neural network\nbut the performance is enhanced marginally. Further improvement, i.e., 70% of\nthe CNN predictions for structures with true De < 0.1 have relative error <30%,\nis achieved by removing trapped regions and dead-end pathways using a simple\nalgorithm.
