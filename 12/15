In this paper, we discuss two novel\napproaches for incorporating semantic knowledge into word embeddings. In the\nfirst approach, we take advantage of Levy et al's work which showed that using\nSVD based methods on co-occurrence matrix provide similar performance to neural\nnetwork based embeddings. We propose a 'sprinkling' technique to add semantic\nrelations to the co-occurrence matrix directly before factorization.

This poses a challenge for\nvision-based navigation on Mars where regions lacking visual texture are\nprevalent.

Here I use\nthe halo model to quantify the information content in the tomographic angular\npower spectrum of galaxies, for future high resolution surveys : Euclid and\nSKA2. I study how this information varies as a function of the scale cut\napplied, either with angular cut $\\ell_{max}$ or physical cut kmax. For this, I\nuse analytical covariances with the most complete census of non-Gaussian terms,\nwhich proves critical. I find that the Fisher information on most cosmological\nand astrophysical parameters follows a striking behaviour. Beyond the\nperturbative regime we first get decreasing returns : the information keeps\nrising but the slope slows down until reaching a saturation. The location of\nthis plateau is a bit beyond the reach of current modeling methods : k $\\sim$ 2\nMpc$^{-1}$ and slightly depends on the parameter and redshift bin considered. I\nexplain the origin of this plateau, which is due to non-linear effects both on\nthe power spectrum, and more importantly on non-Gaussian covariance terms.\nThen, pushing further we see the information rising again in the highly\nnon-linear regime, with a steep slope. This is the small scale miracle, for\nwhich I give interpretation and discuss the properties. Hints are shown that\nthis information should be disentanglable from the astrophysical content, and\ncould improve Dark Energy constraints.

Coded computing is a technique that enables\nstraggler-resistant computation. Most coded computing techniques presented to\ndate provide robustness by ensuring that the time to finish depends only on a\nset of the fastest nodes. However, while stragglers do compute less work than\nnon-stragglers, in real-world commercial cloud computing systems (e.g.,\nAmazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)) the distinction is often a soft one. In\nthis paper, we develop hierarchical coded computing that exploits the work\ncompleted by all nodes, both fast and slow, automatically integrating the\npotential contribution of each. We first present a conceptual framework to\nrepresent the division of work amongst nodes in coded matrix multiplication as\na cuboid partitioning problem. This framework allows us to unify existing\nmethods and motivates new techniques. We then develop three methods of\nhierarchical coded computing that we term bit-interleaved coded computation\n(BICC), multilevel coded computation (MLCC), and hybrid hierarchical coded\ncomputation (HHCC). In this paradigm, each worker is tasked with completing a\nsequence (a hierarchy) of ordered subtasks. The sequence of subtasks, and the\ncomplexity of each, is designed so that partial work completed by stragglers\ncan be used, rather than ignored. We note that our methods can be used in\nconjunction with any coded computing method. We illustrate this by showing how\nwe can use our methods to accelerate all previously developed coded computing\ntechniques by enabling them to exploit stragglers. Under a widely studied\nstatistical model of completion time, our approach realizes a $66\\%$\nimprovement in the expected finishing time.

In order to meet the growing throughput demands, future MIMO-OFDM\nreceivers are expected to utilize a massive number of antennas, operate in\ndynamic environments, and explore high frequency bands, while satisfying strict\nconstraints in terms of cost, power, and size. An emerging technology to\nrealize massive MIMO receivers of reduced cost and power consumption is based\non dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs), which inherently implement controllable\ncompression in acquisition. In this work we study the application of DMAs for\nMIMO-OFDM receivers operating with bit-constrained analog-to-digital converters\n(ADCs). We present a model for DMAs which accounts for the configurable\nfrequency selective profile of its metamaterial elements, resulting in a\nspectrally flexible hybrid structure.

Our numerical results\ndemonstrate that the DMA-based receiver is capable of accurately recovering\nOFDM signals. In particular, we show that by properly exploiting the spectral\ndiversity of DMAs, notable performance gains are obtained over existing designs\nof conventional hybrid architectures, demonstrating the potential of DMAs for\nMIMO-OFDM setups in realizing high performance massive antenna arrays of\nreduced cost and power consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2019 20:16:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

The parametrized\ndouble-well potential possesses two fixed degenerate minima and a constant\nbarrier height, but a tunable shape of its walls influencing the confinement of\nthe two symmetric wells. The transition from quantum tunneling to classical\ncrossover is investigated and it is found that unlike the bistable model based\non the Ginzburg-Landau energy functional, so-called $\\phi^4$ potential model,\nmembers of the family of parametrized double-well potentials can display a\nfirst-order transition above a universal critical value of the shape\ndeformability parameter.

Our results suggest how strongly the associated graph's\nstructure impacts in the characterization of derivations for a given evolution\nalgebra. Therefore our approach constitutes an alternative to the recent\ndevelopments in the research of this subject. As an illustration of the\napplicability of our results we provide some examples and we exhibit the\nclassification of the derivations for non-degenerate irreducible\n$3$-dimensional evolution algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2019 20:56:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

The intuition\nbehind these models is that if we translate from one domain to the other and\nback again we should arrive at where we started. However, existing methods\nalways adopt a symmetric network architecture to learn both forward and\nbackward cycles. Because of the task complexity and cycle input difference\nbetween the source and target image domains, the inequality in bidirectional\nforward-backward cycle translations is significant and the amount of\ninformation between two domains is different. In this paper, we analyze the\nlimitation of the existing symmetric GAN models in asymmetric translation\ntasks, and propose an AsymmetricGAN model with both translation and\nreconstruction generators of unequal sizes and different parameter-sharing\nstrategy to adapt to the asymmetric need in both unsupervised and supervised\nimage-to-image translation tasks. Moreover, the training stage of existing\nmethods has the common problem of model collapse that degrades the quality of\nthe generated images, thus we explore different optimization losses for better\ntraining of AsymmetricGAN, and thus make image-to-image translation with higher\nconsistency and better stability. Extensive experiments on both supervised and\nunsupervised generative tasks with several publicly available datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed AsymmetricGAN achieves superior model capacity\nand better generation performance compared with existing GAN models.

However, as the popularity distribution\nof music items typically is a long-tail distribution, popularity-based\napproaches to music recommendation fall short in satisfying listeners that have\nspecialized music. The contribution of this article is three-fold. We provide\nseveral quantitative measures describing the proximity of a user's music\npreference to the music mainstream. We define the measures at two levels:\nrelating a listener's music preferences to the global music preferences of all\nusers, or relating them to music preferences of the user's country. Moreover,\nwe adopt a distribution-based and a rank-based approach as means to decrease\nbias towards the head of the long-tail distribution. We analyze differences\nbetween countries in terms of their level of mainstreaminess, uncover both\npositive and negative outliers (substantially higher and lower country-specific\npopularity, respectively, compared to the global mainstream), and investigate\ndifferences between countries in terms of listening preferences related to\npopular music artists. We use the standardized LFM-1b dataset, from which we\nanalyze about 8 million listening events shared by about 53,000 users (from 47\ncountries) of the music streaming platform Last.fm. We show that there are\nsubstantial country-specific differences in listeners' music consumption\nbehavior with respect to the most popular artists listened to. We conduct\nrating prediction experiments in which we tailor recommendations to a user's\nlevel of preference for the music mainstream using the proposed 6\nmainstreaminess measures. Results suggest that, in terms of rating prediction\naccuracy, each of the presented mainstreaminess definitions has its merits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2019 21:31:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

Key scientific questions we\ninvestigate include: 1) how pre-eclampsia compares to other maternal-fetal\ncovariates as a predictor of birth weight; and 2) whether the impact of\npre-eclampsia on birthweight varies across gestation. Our model addresses\nseveral key statistical challenges: it correctly encodes the prior medical\nknowledge that birth weight should vary smoothly and monotonically with\ngestational age, yet it also avoids assumptions about functional form along\nwith assumptions about how birth weight varies with other covariates. Our model\nalso accounts for the fact that a high proportion (83%) of birth weights in our\ndata set are rounded to the nearest 100 grams. Such extreme data coarsening is\nrare in maternity hospitals in high resource obstetrics settings but common for\ndata sets collected in low and middle-income countries (LMICs); this introduces\na substantial extra layer of uncertainty into the problem and is a major reason\nwhy we adopt a Bayesian approach.\n  Our proposed non-parametric regression model, which we call Projective Smooth\nBART (psBART), builds upon the highly successful Bayesian Additive Regression\nTree (BART) framework. This model captures complex nonlinear relationships and\ninteractions, induces smoothness and monotonicity in a single target covariate,\nand provides a full posterior for uncertainty quantification. The results of\nour analysis show that pre-eclampsia is a dominant predictor of birth weight in\nthis urban Ugandan setting, and therefore an important risk factor for\nperinatal mortality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2019 23:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

However, there still exist several issues in\nthe previous GCN-based models. First, the topology of the graph is set\nheuristically and fixed over all the model layers and input data. This may not\nbe suitable for the hierarchy of the GCN model and the diversity of the data in\naction recognition tasks. Second, the second-order information of the skeleton\ndata, i.e., the length and orientation of the bones, is rarely investigated,\nwhich is naturally more informative and discriminative for the human action\nrecognition. In this work, we propose a novel multi-stream attention-enhanced\nadaptive graph convolutional neural network (MS-AAGCN) for skeleton-based\naction recognition. The graph topology in our model can be either uniformly or\nindividually learned based on the input data in an end-to-end manner. This\ndata-driven approach increases the flexibility of the model for graph\nconstruction and brings more generality to adapt to various data samples.\nBesides, the proposed adaptive graph convolutional layer is further enhanced by\na spatial-temporal-channel attention module, which helps the model pay more\nattention to important joints, frames and features. Moreover, the information\nof both the joints and bones, together with their motion information, are\nsimultaneously modeled in a multi-stream framework, which shows notable\nimprovement for the recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments on the two\nlarge-scale datasets, NTU-RGBD and Kinetics-Skeleton, demonstrate that the\nperformance of our model exceeds the state-of-the-art with a significant\nmargin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Dec 2019 04:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

As a result, existing supervised\nmethods trained on Rain200A can perform much better for processing real rainy\nimages.

Advances like the variant of CRNN, such as Dense\nConvolutional Network with Connectionist Temporal Classification, has reduced\nthe running time of the network, but exposing the inner computation cost and\nweight size of the convolutional networks as a bottleneck. Specifically, the\nDenseNet based models utilize the dense blocks as the core module, but the\ninner features are combined in the form of concatenation in dense blocks. As\nsuch, the number of channels of combined features delivered as the input of the\nlayers close to the output and the relevant computational cost grows rapidly\nwith the dense blocks getting deeper. This will severely bring heavy\ncomputational cost and big weight size, which restrict the depth of dense\nblocks. In this paper, we propose a compressed convolution block called\nLightweight Dense Block (LDB). To reduce the computing cost and weight size, we\nre-define and re-design the way of combining internal features of the dense\nblocks. LDB is a convolutional block similarly as dense block, but it can\nreduce the computation cost and weight size to (1/L, 2/L), compared with\noriginal ones, where L is the number of layers in blocks. Moreover, LDB can be\nused to replace the original dense block in any DenseNet based models.

Our\nanalysis of the time variations of the magnitude of the distributed electric\ncurrents showed that low-flaring ARs exhibit small variations of the\ndistributed currents in the range of $\\pm 20 \\times 10^{12}$ A, whereas the\nhighly flaring ARs exhibited significant slow variations of the distributed\ncurrents in the range of $30-95 \\times 10^{12}$ A. Intervals of the enhanced\nflaring appear to be co-temporal with smooth enhancements of the distributed\nelectric current.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Dec 2019 12:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

These theories are\ncharacterized by having second-order linearized equations on maximally\nsymmetric background and by possessing static, spherically symmetric (SSS)\nblack hole solutions satisfying $g_{tt}g_{rr}=-1$, and whose thermodynamic\nproperties can be studied analytically in a fully non-perturbative fashion. In\nthe first part of this thesis, we perform a detailed analysis of the weak-field\nlimit of $\\mathcal{L}($Riemann$)$ theories and of the condition\n$g_{tt}g_{rr}=-1$ on SSS solutions, and we review the construction of ECG and\nGeneralized quasi-topological gravities. In addition, we show that GQGs could\nserve as building blocks to construct the most general EFT for gravity. In the\nsecond part we study the non-perturbative corrections to the asymptotically\nflat Schwarzschild black hole in $D=4$. We obtain closed exact expressions for\nthe thermodynamic properties of spherically symmetric black holes with an\narbitrary number of higher-curvature terms.

Since a black\nhole is characterized by the presence of the event horizon, the emitted energy\nmust be extracted from the black hole through its horizon. These considerations\nprovide a motivation to test the validity of the purely ingoing nature of\nblack-hole horizon. In this paper, we propose a novel test of the purely\ningoing nature of black-hole horizon through gravitational-wave detection.

As an emerging\nparadigm, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) has been widely used to provide\ncomputation and storage resources to mobile user equipments (UE) at the edge of\nthe network for improving the performance of mobile applications. In this\npaper, we propose a novel blockchain-based MEC architecture where UEs can\noffload their computation tasks to the MEC servers.

We then propose a novel Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) approach using a double deep Q-network (DQN)\nalgorithm to solve the proposed problem.

In this letter, however, it is found\nthat OAM communication with high-order modulation can be achieved in highly\nreverberant environments by combining the OAM multiplexing with a spatial\nequalizer. The OAM multiplexing exhibits comparable performance of conventional\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Dec 2019 03:37:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-03"}
