Markov clustering\n(MCL) is a renowned algorithm that simulates stochastic flows on a network of\nsample similarities to detect the structural organization of clusters in the\ndata, but it has never been generalized to deal with data nonlinearity. Minimum\nCurvilinearity (MC) is a principle that approximates nonlinear sample distances\nin the high-dimensional feature space by curvilinear distances, which are\ncomputed as transversal paths over their minimum spanning tree, and then stored\nin a kernel. Here we propose MC-MCL, which is the first nonlinear kernel\nextension of MCL and exploits Minimum Curvilinearity to enhance the performance\nof MCL in real and synthetic data with underlying nonlinear patterns. MC-MCL is\ncompared with baseline clustering methods, including DBSCAN, K-means and\naffinity propagation. We find that Minimum Curvilinearity provides a valuable\nframework to estimate nonlinear distances also when its kernel is applied in\ncombination with MCL. Indeed, MC-MCL overcomes classical MCL and even baseline\nclustering algorithms in different nonlinear datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 16:07:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-30"}

Here, we study\nlow-energy lab-scale explosion cratering in 3D granular media using controlled\npulses of pressurized air. We identify four regimes of explosion cratering at\ndifferent burial depths, which are associated with distinct explosion dynamics\nand result in different crater morphologies. We propose a general relation\nbetween the dynamics of granular flows and the surface structures of resulting\ncraters. Moreover, we measure the diameter of explosion craters as a function\nof explosion pressures, durations and burial depths. We find that the size of\ncraters is non-monotonic with increasing burial depths, reaching a maximum at\nan intermediate burial depth. In addition, the crater diameter shows a weak\ndependence on explosion pressures and durations at small burial depths. We\nconstruct a simple model to explain this finding. Finally, we explore the\nscaling relations of the size of explosion craters. Despite the huge difference\nin energy scales, we find that the diameter of explosion craters in our\nexperiments follows the same cube root energy scaling as explosion cratering at\nhigh energies. We also discuss the dependence of rescaled crater sizes on the\ninertial numbers of granular flows.

To address this issue, we formulate\nthe downlink channel prediction as a deep transfer learning (DTL) problem,\nwhere each learning task aims to predict the downlink CSI from the uplink CSI\nfor one single environment. Specifically, we develop the direct-transfer\nalgorithm based on the fully-connected neural network architecture, where the\nnetwork is trained on the data from all previous environments in the manner of\nclassical deep learning and is then fine-tuned for new environments. To further\nimprove the transfer efficiency, we propose the meta-learning algorithm that\ntrains the network by alternating inner-task and across-task updates and then\nadapts to a new environment with a small number of labeled data. Simulation\nresults show that the direct-transfer algorithm achieves better performance\nthan the deep learning algorithm, which implies that the transfer learning\nbenefits the downlink channel prediction in new environments.

However, this simplified model does not\ncapture all the physics of EIT experiments with real atoms. We present a\ntheoretical study of the effect of two closely-spaced excited states on EIT and\noff-resonance Raman transitions. We find that the coherent interaction of the\nfields with two excited states whose separation is smaller than their Doppler\nbroadened linewidth can enhance the EIT transmission and broaden the width of\nthe EIT peak. However, a shift of the two-photon resonance frequency for\nsystems with transitions of unequal dipole strengths leads to a reduction of\nthe maximum transparency that can be achieved when Doppler broadening is taken\ninto account even under ideal conditions of no decoherence. As a result,\ncomplete transparency cannot be achieved in a vapor cell. Only when the\nseparation between the two excited states is of the order of the Doppler width\nor larger can complete transparency be recovered. In addition, we show that\noff-resonance Raman absorption is enhanced and its resonance frequency is\nshifted.

We also give modular interpretations for various\naspects of this uniformization, for example for the degenerations of $C_t$ into\n$10$ lines (resp.\\ $5$ conics) whose intersection graph is the Petersen graph\n(resp.\\ $K_5$).\n  In the second half of this paper we give an explicit arithmetic\nuniformization of the Wiman curve $C_0$ itself as the quotient\n$\\Lambda\\backslash \\Hf$, where $\\Lambda$ is a principal level $5$ subgroup of a\ncertain \"unit spinor norm\" group of M\\\"{o}bius transformations. We then prove\nthat $C_0$ is a certain moduli space of Hodge structures, endowing it with the\nstructure of a Shimura curve of indefinite quaternionic type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 18:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-30"}

Two categories\nof studies exist in the literature. First, studies that focus on which nodes\nfrom the network to select considering the existence of the opponents. Second,\nstudies that focus on the problem of budget allocation. In this work, we\nintegrate these two lines of research and propose a new scenario where\ncompetition happens in two phases. First, parties identify the most influential\nnodes of the network. Then they compete over only these influential nodes by\nthe amount of budget they allocate to each node. We provide a strong motivation\nfor this integration. Also, in previous budget allocation studies, any fraction\nof the budget could be allocated to a node, which means that the action space\nwas continuous. However, in our scenario, we consider that the action space is\ndiscrete. This consideration is far more realistic, and it significantly\nchanges the problem. We model the scenario as a game and propose a novel\nframework for calculating the Nash equilibrium. Notably, building an efficient\nframework for this problem with such a huge action space and also handling the\nstochastic environment of influence maximization is very challenging. To tackle\nthese difficulties, we devise a new payoff estimation method and a novel best\nresponse oracle to boost the efficiency of our framework.

We propose to incorporate context in\nobject detection by post-processing the output of an arbitrary detector to\nrescore the confidences of its detections. Rescoring is done by conditioning on\ncontextual information from the entire set of detections: their confidences,\npredicted classes, and positions. We show that AP can be improved by simply\nreassigning the detection confidence values such that true positives that\nsurvive longer (i.e., those with the correct class and large IoU) are scored\nhigher than false positives or detections with small IoU. In this setting, we\nuse a bidirectional RNN with attention for contextual rescoring and introduce a\ntraining target that uses the IoU with ground truth to maximize AP for the\ngiven set of detections. The fact that our approach does not require access to\nvisual features makes it computationally inexpensive and agnostic to the\ndetection architecture. In spite of this simplicity, our model consistently\nimproves AP over strong pre-trained baselines (Cascade R-CNN and Faster R-CNN\nwith several backbones), particularly by reducing the confidence of duplicate\ndetections (a learned form of non-maximum suppression) and removing\nout-of-context objects by conditioning on the confidences, classes, positions,\nand sizes of the co-occurrent detections.

Our non-equilibrium\ncoset construction makes significant advances beyond more standard coset\nconstructions in that it takes advantage of recently-developed techniques,\nwhich allow the formulation of non-equilibrium effective actions that account\nfor quantum and thermal fluctuations as well as dissipation. Because these\nsystems exist at finite temperature, the EFTs live on the closed-time-path of\nthe Schwinger-Keldysh contour. Since the coset construction and the\nnon-equilibrium effective actions may be unfamiliar to many readers, we include\nbrief introductions to these topics in an effort to make this paper\nself-contained. To demonstrate the legitimacy of this coset construction, we\nsuccessfully reproduce the known EFTs for fluids and superfluids at finite\ntemperature. Then, to demonstrate its utility, we construct novel EFTs for\nsolids, supersolids, and four phases of liquid crystals, all at finite\ntemperature. We thereby combine the non-equilibrium effective action and the\ncoset construction to create a powerful tool that can be used to study\nmany-body systems out of thermal equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 14:34:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 20:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-21"}

We investigate whether an exactly localized braneworld can\narise as a limit of a theory of 5D fields. Using a holographic formalism we\nargue that such limit does not exist in the presence of gravity, therefore\nimplying a discontinuity in the space of EFTs. We then present specific models\ninvolving exactly localized fields in which inconsistencies appear, which are\nsolved when fields are taken as quasilocalized. Part of our arguments rely on\nconjectures from the \"swampland\" program. Our investigation motivates\nbraneworld EFTs built from 5D fields, i.e. quasilocalized braneworlds.\nObservable effects from quasilocalization are significant for warped\nbraneworlds such as Randall-Sundrum II (RSII), and are reminiscent of a\nconformal hidden sector. Focusing on the gauge-gravity sector we show that\nmanifestations of the quasilocalized warped braneworld include i) an anomalous\nrunning of SM gauge couplings ii) a conformal contribution to SM gauge boson\nscattering induced by 5D gravity. Constraining these effects puts an upper\nbound on the 5D EFT cutoff, implying that the warped braneworld hypothesis\ncould---at least in principle---be tested completely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 19:20:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Jan 2020 05:42:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 06:49:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 04:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

Under this embedding, the Hamiltonian operator of a\nLorentz-invariant quantum system, constructed as a natural Laplace-type\noperator on bundle sections, pulls back to the generator of the unitary group\nof Koopman operators governing the evolution of classical observables of the\nharmonic oscillator, with Koopman eigenfunctions of zero, positive, and\nnegative eigenfrequency corresponding to quantum eigenstates of zero\n(\"vacuum\"), positive (\"matter\"), and negative (\"antimatter\") energy. The\nembedding also induces a pair of operators acting on classical observables of\nthe harmonic oscillator, exhibiting canonical position-momentum commutation\nrelationships. These operators have the structure of order-$1/2$ fractional\nderivatives, and therefore display a form of non-locality. In a second part of\nthis work, we study a quantum mechanical representation of the classical\nharmonic oscillator using a one-parameter family of reproducing kernel Hilbert\nalgebras associated with the transition kernel of a fractional diffusion on the\ncircle, where a stronger notion of classical-quantum consistency is established\nthan in the $L^2(\\mu)$ case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 21:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Jan 2020 04:30:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 02:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-31"}

Traditional methods that perform well for moderate sample\nsizes and low-dimensional data do not scale to massive data. Analysis of\nnational kidney transplant data with a massive sample size and large number of\npredictors defy any existing statistical methods and software. In view of these\ndifficulties, we propose a Minorization-Maximization-based steepest ascent\nprocedure for estimating the time-varying effects. Leveraging the block\nstructure formed by the basis expansions, the proposed procedure iteratively\nupdates the optimal block-wise direction along which the approximate increase\nin the log-partial likelihood is maximized. The resulting estimates ensure the\nascent property and serve as refinements of the previous step.

Our recent work on combining multi-wavelength\nleptonic emission models with simulated thermal+non-thermal distributions from\nshock acceleration theory has resulted in new insights into plasma conditions\nin blazars. This has demonstrated the ability to infer the cyclotron frequency,\nthe plasma density and thus also the Alfven speed, thereby determining the\nrapidity of particle energization. An important inference was that MHD\nturbulence levels decline with remoteness from jet shocks. This paper outlines\nnew results from our recent extension of this program to a two-zone,\ntime-evolving construction, modeling together both extended, enhanced emission\nstates from larger radiative regions, and prompt flare events from compact\nacceleration zones. These are applied to flares in the FSRQ blazar 3C 279\nmonitored by Fermi-LAT in gamma-rays in late 2013. With impulsive injection\nepisodes from the shock zone, as the acceleration first proceeds and then\nabates, the radiative simulations obtain a pronounced spectral hardening in the\noptical and gamma-ray bands as the flare grows, followed by a softening during\nthe decay phase. For 3C 279, while model radio and X-ray synchrotron flares are\ntemporally correlated, there is a lag in both bands relative to GeV gamma rays\nand optical emission on timescales of a number of hours. This delay is governed\nby the short cooling time associated with the bright external Compton signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 22:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

The common tool for studying this kind of\nstructure in computing science is the formal grammar but, in the case of music,\ngrammars run into problems due to the ambiguous nature of some of the concepts\ndefined in music theory. In this paper, we consider one of such constructs:\nmodulation, that is, the change of key in the middle of a musical piece, an\nimportant tool used by many authors to enhance the capacity of music to express\nemotions. We develop a hybrid method in which an evidence-gathering numerical\nmethod detects modulation and then, based on the detected tonalities, a\nnon-ambiguous grammar can be used for analyzing the structure of each tonal\ncomponent. Experiments with music from the XVII and XVIII centuries show that\nwe can detect the precise point of modulation with an error of at most two\nchords in almost 97% of the cases.

While the present method\ncan be easily applied to close manifolds, the emphasis is given to more\nchallenging compact manifolds with 2-manifold boundaries, which require\nappropriate analysis and treatment of boundary conditions on differential forms\nto maintain proper topological properties. Three sets of unique evolutionary\nHodge Laplacian operators are proposed to generate three sets of\ntopology-preserving singular spectra, for which the multiplicities of zero\neigenvalues correspond to exactly the persistent Betti numbers of dimensions 0,\n1, and 2. Additionally, three sets of non-zero eigenvalues further reveal both\ntopological persistence and geometric progression during the manifold\nevolution. Extensive numerical experiments are carried out via the discrete\nexterior calculus to demonstrate the utility and usefulness of the proposed\nmethod for data representation and shape analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Dec 2019 03:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

It is\ntraditionally tackled with matrix factorization. Recently, deep learning based\nmethods, especially graph neural networks, have made impressive progress on\nthis problem. Despite their effectiveness, existing methods focus on modeling\nthe user-item interaction graph. The inherent drawback of such methods is that\ntheir performance is bound to the density of the interactions, which is however\nusually of high sparsity. More importantly, for a cold start user/item that\ndoes not have any interactions, such methods are unable to learn the preference\nembedding of the user/item since there is no link to this user/item in the\ngraph. In this work, we develop a novel framework Attribute Graph Neural\nNetworks (AGNN) by exploiting the attribute graph rather than the commonly used\ninteraction graph. This leads to the capability of learning embeddings for cold\nstart users/items. Our AGNN can produce the preference embedding for a cold\nuser/item by learning on the distribution of attributes with an extended\nvariational auto-encoder structure. Moreover, we propose a new graph neural\nnetwork variant, i.e., gated-GNN, to effectively aggregate various attributes\nof different modalities in a neighborhood.

Although beamforming can be\ndone in the digital and analog domains, both approaches are hindered by several\nconstraints when it comes to mmWave communications. For example, performing\nfully digital beamforming in mmWave systems involves using many radio frequency\n(RF) chains, which are expensive and consume high power. This necessitates\nfinding more efficient ways for using fewer RF chains while taking advantage of\nthe large antenna arrays. One way to overcome this challenge is to employ\n(partially or fully) analog beamforming through proper configuration of\nphase-shifters. Existing works on mmWave analog beam design either rely on the\nknowledge of the channel state information (CSI) per antenna within the array,\nrequire a large search time (e.g., exhaustive search) or do not guarantee a\nminimum beamforming gain (e.g., codebook based beamforming). In this paper, we\npropose a beam design technique that reduces the search time and does not\nrequire CSI while guaranteeing a minimum beamforming gain. The key idea derives\nfrom observations drawn from real-life measurements. It was observed that for a\ngiven propagation environment (e.g., coverage area of a mmWave BS) the\nazimuthal angles of dominant signals could be more probable from certain angles\nthan others. Thus, pre-collected measurements could used to build a beamforming\ncodebook that regroups the most probable beam designs. We invoke Bayesian\nlearning for measurements clustering. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed\nscheme in terms of building the codebook and assessing its performance through\nreal-life measurements. We demonstrate that the training time required by the\nproposed scheme is only 5% of that of exhaustive search. This crucial gain is\nobtained while achieving a minimum targeted beamforming gain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Dec 2019 05:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

Often, due to the occlusion in satellite imagery and\nthe spatial correlation of road attributes, a road attribute at one position on\na road may only be apparent when considering far-away segments of the road.\nThus, to robustly infer road attributes, the model must integrate scattered\ninformation and capture the spatial correlation of features along roads.\nExisting solutions that rely on image classifiers fail to capture this\ncorrelation, resulting in poor accuracy. We find this failure is caused by a\nfundamental limitation -- the limited effective receptive field of image\nclassifiers. To overcome this limitation, we propose RoadTagger, an end-to-end\narchitecture which combines both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs) to infer road attributes.

As this process has obvious analogy with noninferiority testing of new\ndrugs, we investigate how repeated testing and adoption of modifications might\nlead to gradual deterioration in prediction accuracy, also known as\n``biocreep'' in the drug development literature.

We control these rates in\nthe simple setting of a constant population and data source using policies\naACP-BAC and aACP-BABR, which combine alpha-investing, group-sequential, and\ngate-keeping methods. In simulation studies, bio-creep regularly occurred when\nusing policies with no error-rate guarantees, whereas aACP-BAC and -BABR\ncontrolled the rate of bio-creep without substantially impacting our ability to\napprove beneficial modifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Dec 2019 06:34:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

A main contribution\nof this paper is the observation of an empirical necessary condition (ENC) from\nthe results of exhaustive search, which shrinks the search space to quickly\nfind an optimal solution. ENC shows that the maximum and minimum in- and\nout-degrees of an optimal network structure should be almost identical, or\nwithin a very narrow range, i.e., the network should be extremely homogeneous.\nEdge rectification towards the satisfaction of the ENC is then designed and\nevaluated. Simulation results on large-sized synthetic and real-world networks\nverify the effectiveness of both the observed ENC and the edge rectification\nscheme. As more operations of edge rectification are performed, the network is\ngetting closer to exactly satisfying the ENC, and consequently the robustness\nof the network controllability is enhanced towards optimum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Dec 2019 07:02:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 02:20:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 05:22:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

By solving an inverse\nproblem in computational imaging, DNNs can overcome several shortcomings in the\nconventional lensless imaging through scattering media methods, namely, high\ncost, poor quality, complex control, and poor anti-interference. However, for\ntraining, a large number of training samples on various datasets have to be\ncollected, with a DNN trained on one dataset generally performing poorly for\nrecovering images from another dataset. The underlying reason is that lensless\nimaging through scattering media is a high dimensional regression problem and\nit is difficult to obtain an analytical solution. In this work, transfer\nlearning is proposed to address this issue. Our main idea is to train a DNN on\na relatively complex dataset using a large number of training samples and\nfine-tune the last few layers using very few samples from other datasets.\nInstead of the thousands of samples required to train from scratch, transfer\nlearning alleviates the problem of costly data acquisition. Specifically,\nconsidering the difference in sample sizes and similarity among datasets, we\npropose two DNN architectures, namely LISMU-FCN and LISMU-OCN, and a balance\nloss function designed for balancing smoothness and sharpness. LISMU-FCN, with\nmuch fewer parameters, can achieve imaging across similar datasets while\nLISMU-OCN can achieve imaging across significantly different datasets.

In this paper, we advocate the adoption of massive\nmultiple-input multiple output (MIMO) to support the wireless transmission for\nindustrial applications as it can provide deterministic communications similar\nas wired lines thanks to its channel hardening effects. To reduce the latency,\nthe channel blocklength for packet transmission is finite, and suffers from\ntransmission rate degradation and decoding error probability.

In ontology-mediated querying, TGDs can formalize the ontology\nand thus derive additional facts from the given data, while in querying in the\npresence of constraints, they restrict the set of admissible databases. In this\nwork, we study the limits of efficient query evaluation in the context of the\nabove two problems, focussing on guarded and frontier-guarded TGDs and on UCQs\nas the actual queries. We show that a class of ontology-mediated queries (OMQs)\nbased on guarded TGDs can be evaluated in FPT iff the OMQs in the class are\nequivalent to OMQs in which the actual query has bounded treewidth, up to some\nreasonable assumptions.

Protein docking provides a computational\nalternative to predict such information. However, ranking near-native docked\nmodels high among a large number of candidates, often known as the scoring\nproblem, remains a critical challenge. Moreover, estimating model quality, also\nknown as the quality assessment problem, is rarely addressed in protein\ndocking.\n  In this study the two challenging problems in protein docking are regarded as\nrelative and absolute scoring, respectively, and addressed in one\nphysics-inspired deep learning framework.

Specifically, we found that a hybrid architecture of a convolutional\nneural network and recurrent neural network ensemble using expert features\nyields the best results. However, there are some new challenges and problems\nrelated to interpretability, scalability, and efficiency that must be\naddressed. Furthermore, it is also worth investigating new applications from\nthe perspectives of datasets and methods. Significance: This paper summarizes\nexisting deep learning research using ECG data from multiple perspectives and\nhighlights existing challenges and problems to identify potential future\nresearch directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Dec 2019 02:44:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 19:01:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 18:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-04"}
