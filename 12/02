However, it\nis difficult for classical control methods to give precise environment\nsetpoints, such as temperature, humidity, light intensity and carbon dioxide\nconcentration for greenhouse because it is uncertain nonlinear system.\nTherefore, an intelligent close loop control framework based on model embedded\ndeep reinforcement learning (MEDRL) is designed for greenhouse environment\ncontrol. Specifically, computer vision algorithms are used to recognize growing\nperiods and sex of crops, followed by the crop growth models, which can be\ntrained with different growing periods and sex. These model outputs combined\nwith the cost factor provide the setpoints for greenhouse and feedback to the\ncontrol system in real-time. The whole MEDRL system has capability to conduct\noptimization control precisely and conveniently, and costs will be greatly\nreduced compared with traditional greenhouse control approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2019 18:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

We conduct an\nextensive study using real world wind data from a grid of equispaced wind\ngenerators sharing a common battery.

We find\nthat the statistical diversity in wind generation across different locations\nyields useful economies of scale once the grid spacing exceeds 200 km. When the\ngrid spacing exceeds 500 km, we find that the economies grow dramatically: The\nshared battery size becomes insensitive to the number of participating\ngenerators. This means that the generators can access a common, shared battery\nand collectively achieve the same reliability they would have, had each of them\nhad the entire battery to themselves. To provide a rigourous foundation for\nthis remarkable observation, we propose a mathematical model that demonstrates\nthis phenomenon, assuming that the net generation (generation minus demand)\nprocesses associated with the generators are statistically independent.

We show that in the General\nRelativity the gravitational field suppresses the occurrence of the spherical\nsingularities under some generic conditions. Our consideration deals with\nasymptotically flat space-times around static spherically symmetric\nconfigurations in presence of $N$ non-linear SFs, which are minimally coupled\nto gravity. Constraints are imposed on the SF potentials, which guarantee a\nmonotonicity of the fields as functions of radial variable; also the potentials\nare assumed to be exponentially bounded. We give direct proof that solutions of\nthe joint system of Einstein -- SF equations satisfying the conditions of\nasymptotic flatness are regular for all values of $r$, except for naked\nsingularities in the center $r=0$ in the Schwarzschild (curvature) coordinates.\nAsymptotic relations for SF and metric near the center are derived, which\nappear to be remarkably similar to the case of the Fisher solution for free SF.\nThese relations determine two main types of the corresponding geodesic\nstructure when photons can be captured by the singularity or not depending on\nthe existence of the photon sphere. To illustrate, the case of one SF with\nmonomial potential is analyzed in detail numerically. We show that the image of\nthe accretion disk around the singularity, observed from infinity, can take the\nform of a bright ring with a dark spot in the center, like the case of an\nordinary black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2019 18:33:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2019 08:45:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 07:17:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

We introduce a\nnew notion of rectifiability that is possibly, weaker than the one introduced\nby Franchi, Serapioni, and Serra Cassano. Namely, we consider subsets $\\Gamma$\nthat, similarly to intrinsic Lipschitz graphs, have a cone property: there\nexists an open dilation-invariant subset $C$ whose translations by elements in\n$\\Gamma$ don't intersect $\\Gamma$. However, a priori the cone $C$ may not have\nany horizontal directions in its interior. In every Carnot group, we prove that\nthe reduced boundary of every finite-perimeter subset can be covered by\ncountably many subsets that have such a cone property. The cones are related to\nthe semigroups generated by the horizontal half-spaces determined by the normal\ndirections. We further study the case when one can find horizontal directions\nin the interior of the cones, in which case we infer that finite-perimeter\nsubsets are countably rectifiable with respect to intrinsic Lipschitz graphs. A\nsufficient condition for this to hold is the existence of a horizontal\none-parameter subgroup that is not an abnormal curve.

Remarkably,\nultra-fast ($v\\geq 0.1c$), outflows in the UV and X-ray bands are often seen in\nAGNs. Depending on their energy and mass outflow rate, respectively\n$\\dot{E}_{out}, \\dot{M}_{out}$, such outflows may play a key role in regulating\nthe AGN-host galaxy co-evolution process through cosmic time. It is therefore\ncrucial to provide accurate estimates of the wind properties. Here, we\nconcentrate on special relativistic effects concerning the interaction of light\nwith matter moving at relativistic speed relatively to the source of radiation.\nOur aim is to assess the impact of these effects on the observed properties of\nthe outflows and implement a relativistic correction in the existing spectral\nmodelling routines. We define a simple procedure to incorporate relativistic\neffects in radiative transfer codes. Following this procedure, we run a series\nof simulations to explore the impact of these effects on the simulated spectra,\nfor different $v$ and column densities of the outflow. The observed optical\ndepth is usually considered a proxy for the wind $N_H$, independently on its\nvelocity. However, our simulations show that the observed optical depth of an\noutflow with a given column density $N_H$ decreases rapidly as the velocity of\nthe wind approaches relativistic values. This, in turn, implies that when\nestimating $N_H$ from the optical depth, it is necessary to include a\nvelocity-dependent correction, already for moderate velocities (e.g. $v \\geq\n0.05c$). This correction linearly propagates to the derived $\\dot{M}_{out},\n\\dot{E}_{out}$. As an example of these effects, we calculate the\nrelativistically corrected values of $\\dot{M}_{out}$ and $\\dot{E}_{out}$ for a\nsample of $\\sim 30$ Ultra-Fast Outflows taken from the literature, and find\ncorrection factors of $20-120 \\%$ within the observed range of outflowing\nvelocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2019 20:21:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

Our multigrid method is\nrobust with respect to highly varying coefficients and the number of interfaces\nin a domain. It shows level independent convergence rates when applied to\ndifferent variants of Nitsche's method. Generally, multigrid methods require a\nhierarchy of finite element (FE) spaces which can be created geometrically\nusing a hierarchy of nested meshes. However, in the XFEM framework, standard\nmultigrid methods might demonstrate poor convergence properties if the\nhierarchy of FE spaces employed is not nested. We design a prolongation\noperator for the multigrid method in such a way that it can accommodate the\ndiscontinuities across the interfaces in the XFEM framework and recursively\ninduces a nested FE space hierarchy. The prolongation operator is constructed\nusing so-called pseudo-$L^2$-projections; as common, the adjoint of the\nprolongation operator is employed as the restriction operator. The\nstabilization parameter in Nitsche's method plays an important role in imposing\ninterface conditions and also affects the condition number of the linear\nsystems. We discuss the requirements on the stabilization parameter to ensure\ncoercivity and review selected strategies from the literature which are used to\nimplicitly estimate the stabilization parameter. Eventually, we compare the\nimpact of different variations of Nitsche's method on discretization errors and\ncondition number of the linear systems.

Relevance ranking aims at building a ranked list sorted in\ndecreasing order of item relevance, while result diversification focuses on\ngenerating a ranked list of items that covers a broad range of topics. In this\npaper, we study an online learning setting that aims to recommend a ranked list\nwith $K$ items that maximizes the ranking utility, i.e., a list whose items are\nrelevant and whose topics are diverse. We formulate it as the cascade hybrid\nbandits (CHB) problem. CHB assumes the cascading user behavior, where a user\nbrowses the displayed list from top to bottom, clicks the first attractive\nitem, and stops browsing the rest. We propose a hybrid contextual bandit\napproach, called CascadeHybrid, for solving this problem.

The second is that they ignore the division between\nDonors and Receivers of altruism and the distribution of those roles in the\npopulation. In this paper the Inclusive Fitness and Kin Selection approaches\nwill be expressed by explicit demographic parameters describing the probability\nof death during focal interaction when cooperative trait can be exhibited.

In effect it is shown that even in the case when fluxes between\nroles are driven by selectively neutral mechanisms (acting in the same way on\nall strategies), the differences in the mortalities in the focal interaction\nwill lead to different distributions of roles for different strategies.

A generated image could be perfect except in a single area but\nstill be detected as fake. Instead, we propose a novel approach for detecting\nwhere errors occur within a generated image. By collaging real images with\ngenerated images, we compute for each pixel, whether it belongs to the real\ndistribution or generated distribution. Furthermore, we leverage attention to\nmodel long-range dependency; this allows detection of errors which are\nreasonable locally but not holistically. For evaluation, we show that our error\ndetection can act as a quality metric for an individual image, unlike FID and\nIS.

The\nemerging smart-grid concept is a compelling critical CPS infrastructure that\nrelies on two-way communications between smart devices to increase efficiency,\nenhance reliability, and reduce costs. However, compromised devices in the\nsmart grid poses several security challenges. Consequences of propagating fake\ndata or stealing sensitive smart grid information via compromised devices are\ncostly. Hence, early behavioral detection of compromised devices is critical\nfor protecting the smart grid's components and data. To address these concerns,\nin this paper, we introduce a novel and configurable system-level framework to\nidentify compromised smart grid devices. The framework combines system and\nfunction call tracing techniques with signal processing and statistical\nanalysis to detect compromised devices based on their behavioral\ncharacteristics. We measure the efficacy of our framework with a realistic\nsmart grid substation testbed that includes both resource-limited and\nresource-rich devices. In total, using our framework, we analyze six different\ntypes of compromised device scenarios with different resources and attack\npayloads. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first in\ndetecting compromised CPS smart grid devices with system and function-level\ncall tracing techniques. The experimental results reveal an excellent rate for\nthe detection of compromised devices. Specifically, performance metrics include\naccuracy values between 95% and 99% for the different attack scenarios.\nFinally, the performance analysis demonstrates that the use of the proposed\nframework has minimal overhead on the smart grid devices' computing resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 01:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

Among the variants of\nGNNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) learn to assign dense attention\ncoefficients over all neighbors of a node for feature aggregation, and improve\nthe performance of many graph learning tasks. However, real-world graphs are\noften very large and noisy, and GATs are prone to overfitting if not\nregularized properly. Even worse, the local aggregation mechanism of GATs may\nfail on disassortative graphs, where nodes within local neighborhood provide\nmore noise than useful information for feature aggregation. In this paper, we\npropose Sparse Graph Attention Networks (SGATs) that learn sparse attention\ncoefficients under an $L_0$-norm regularization, and the learned sparse\nattentions are then used for all GNN layers, resulting in an edge-sparsified\ngraph. By doing so, we can identify noisy/task-irrelevant edges, and thus\nperform feature aggregation on most informative neighbors. Extensive\nexperiments on synthetic and real-world graph learning benchmarks demonstrate\nthe superior performance of SGATs. In particular, SGATs can remove about\n50\\%-80\\% edges from large assortative graphs, while retaining similar\nclassification accuracies. On disassortative graphs, SGATs prune majority of\nnoisy edges and outperform GATs in classification accuracies by significant\nmargins. Furthermore, the removed edges can be interpreted intuitively and\nquantitatively.

Existing schemes are effective and\nrealized by tuning the coupling strengths between modes. However, such\napproaches are severely restricted due to the small amount of strength that can\nbe tuned and the difficulty to perform the tuning in some situations, such as\non-chip microcavity system. Here, we propose a novel approach that realizes the\nstate transfer between different modes in optical microcavities by tuning the\nfrequency of an intermediate mode. We showed that for typical functions of\nfrequency-tuning, such as linear and periodic functions, the state transfer can\nbe realized successfully with different features. To optimize the process, we\nuse gradient descent technique to find an optimal tuning function for the fast\nand perfect state transfer. We also showed that our approach has significant\nnonreciprocity with appropriate tuning variables, where one can\nunidirectionally transfer a state from one mode to another, but the inverse\ndirection transfer is forbidden.

Also, the gender-activity bias, owing to the\nword-by-word prediction, influences other words in the caption prediction,\nresulting in the well-known problem of label bias. In this work, we investigate\ngender bias in the COCO captioning dataset and show that it engenders not only\nfrom the statistical distribution of genders with contexts but also from the\nflawed annotation by the human annotators. We look at the issues created by\nthis bias in the trained models. We propose a technique to get rid of the bias\nby splitting the task into 2 subtasks: gender-neutral image captioning and\ngender classification. By this decoupling, the gender-context influence can be\neradicated. We train the gender-neutral image captioning model, which gives\ncomparable results to a gendered model even when evaluating against a dataset\nthat possesses a similar bias as the training data. Interestingly, the\npredictions by this model on images with no humans, are also visibly different\nfrom the one trained on gendered captions.

Currently, a popular algorithm\nfor matrix completion is Singular Value Threshold (SVT). In this algorithm, the\nsingular value threshold should be set first. However, in a recommendation\nsystem, the dimension of the preference matrix keeps changing. Therefore, it is\ndifficult to directly apply SVT. In addition, what the users of a\nrecommendation system need is a sequence of personalized recommended results\nrather than the estimation of their scores. According to the above ideas, this\npaper proposes a novel approach named probability completion model~(PCM). By\nreducing the data dimension, the transitivity of the similar matrix, and\nsingular value decomposition, this approach quickly obtains a completion matrix\nwith the same probability distribution as the original matrix. The approach\ngreatly reduces the computation time based on the accuracy of the sacrifice\npart, and can quickly obtain a low-rank similarity matrix with data trend\napproximation properties. The experimental results show that PCM can quickly\ngenerate a complementary matrix with similar data trends as the original\nmatrix. The LCS score and efficiency of PCM are both higher than SVT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 07:10:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 00:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-05"}

The metasurface is comprised of an\narrangement of sub-wavelength horizontal mechanical resonators embedded in\nsilica microbeads. The metasurface supports a frequency-tailorable attenuation\nzone induced by the translational mode of the resonators. The experimental and\nnumerical findings reveal that the metasurface not only backscatters part of\nthe energy, but also redirects the wavefront underneath the resonators leading\nto a considerable amplitude attenuation at the surface level, when all the\nresonators have similar resonant frequency. A more complex picture emerges when\nusing resonators arranged in a so-called graded design, e.g., with a resonant\nfrequency increasing/decreasing throughout the metasurface. Unlike Love waves\npropagating in a bi-layer medium, shear waves localized at the surface of our\nmetasurface are not converted into bulk waves. Although a detachment from the\nsurface occurs, the depth-dependent velocity profile of the granular medium\nprevents the mode-conversion, steering again the horizontally polarized shear\nwaves towards the surface. The outcomes of our experimental and numerical\nstudies allow for understanding the dynamics of wave propagation in resonant\nmetamaterials embedded in vertically inhomogeneous soils and, therefore, are\nessential for improving the design of engineered devices for ground vibration\nand seismic wave containment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 08:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

We study\nthe question of the gradient blowup rate for classical solutions with $p>2$.\n  We first consider the case of time-increasing solutions. For such solutions,\nthe precise rate was obtained by Guo and Hu (2008) in one space dimension, but\nthe higher dimensional case has remained an open question (except for radially\nsymmetric solutions in a ball).

Under compression, the deformation in $<$112$>$ perfect\nas well as twinned nanopillars proceeds by the slip of extended dislocations.\nIn twinned nanopillars, an extensive cross-slip by way of Friedel-Escaig and\nFleischer mechanisms has been observed in compression. On the other hand, under\ntensile loading, the deformation in perfect nanopillars occurs by partial\nslip/twinning, while in twinned nanopillars, it proceeds by the slip of\nextended dislocations. This extended dislocation activity is facilitated by\nstair-rod formation and its dissociation on the twin boundary. Similar to\ncompressive loading, the extended dislocations under tensile loading also\nexhibit cross-slip activity in twinned nanopillars.

When exploring the resulting large trajectory\ncollections, visual summaries are a useful tool to identify time intervals of\ninterest. A typical approach is to represent the spatial positions of the\ntracked objects at each time step via a one-dimensional ordering;\nvisualizations of such orderings can then be placed in temporal order along a\ntime line. There are two main criteria to assess the quality of the resulting\nvisual summary: spatial quality -- how well does the ordering capture the\nstructure of the data at each time step, and stability -- how coherent are the\norderings over consecutive time steps or temporal ranges? In this paper we\nintroduce a new Stable Principal Component (SPC) method to compute such\norderings, which is explicitly parameterized for stability, allowing a\ntrade-off between the spatial quality and stability. We conduct extensive\ncomputational experiments that quantitatively compare the orderings produced by\nours and other stable dimensionality-reduction methods to various\nstate-of-the-art approaches using a set of well-established quality metrics\nthat capture spatial quality and stability.

We present an exploratory near-infrared spectroscopic\nvariability study of 14 eruptive YSOs. The variations were sampled over 1-day\nand 1 to 2-year intervals and analysed in combination with VVV light curves. CO\novertone absorption features are observed on 3 objects with FUor-like spectra:\nall show deeper absorption when they are brighter. This implies stronger\nemission from the circumstellar disc with a steeper vertical temperature\ngradient when the accretion rate is higher. This confirms the nature of fast\nVVV FUor-like events, in line with the accepted picture for classical FUors.\nThe absence of Br$\\gamma$ emission in a FUor-like object declining to\npre-outburst brightness suggests that reconstruction of the stellar magnetic\nfield is a slow process. Within the 1-day timescale, 60% of H$_2$-emitting YSOs\nshow significant but modest variation, and 2/6 sources have large variations in\nBr$\\gamma$. Over year-long timescales, H$_2$ flux variations remain modest\ndespite up to 1.8 mag variation in $K_s$. This indicates that emission from the\nmolecular outflow usually arises further from the protostar and is unaffected\nby relatively large changes in accretion rate on year-long timescales. Two\nobjects show signs of on/off magnetospheric accretion traced by Br$\\gamma$\nemission. In addition, a 60% inter-night brightening of the H$_2$ outflow is\ndetected in one YSO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 12:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

Our findings of the effects of LOB factors on the inter-trade durations\nhelp to understand more about the high-frequency market microstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 13:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

Effective spacetime descriptions\nincorporating quantum geometry corrections are provided by the so-called\npolymer models. Despite the technical differences, the main common feature\nshared by these models is that the classical singularity is resolved by a\nblack-to-white hole transition. In a recent paper, we discussed the existence\nof two Dirac observables in the effective quantum theory respectively\ncorresponding to the black and white hole mass. Physical requirements about the\nonset of quantum effects then fix the relation between these observables after\nthe bounce, which in turn corresponds to a restriction on the admissible\ninitial conditions for the model. In the present paper, we discuss in detail\nthe role of such observables in black hole polymer models. First, we revisit\nprevious models and analyse the existence of the Dirac observables there.\nObservables for the horizons or the masses are explicitly constructed. In the\nclassical theory, only one Dirac observable has physical relevance. In the\nquantum theory, we find a relation between the existence of two physically\nrelevant observables and the scaling behaviour of the polymerisation scales\nunder fiducial cell rescaling. We present then a new model based on\npolymerisation of new variables which allows to overcome previous restrictions\non initial conditions. Quantum effects cause a bound of a unique Kretschmann\ncurvature scale, independently of the relation between the two masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 13:38:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 07:14:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-08"}

The main goal of this paper is to constrain the\nlocation of the high-energy emission in the blazar TXS 2013+370 and to study\nthe physical and geometrical properties of the inner jet region on sub-pc\nscales. VLBI observations at 86 GHz and space-VLBI at 22 GHz allowed us to\nimage the jet base with an angular resolution of $\\sim$0.4 pc. By employing\nCLEAN imaging and Gaussian model-fitting, we performed a thorough kinematic\nanalysis, which provided estimates of the jet speed, orientation, and component\nejection times. Additionally, we studied the jet expansion profile and used the\ninformation on the jet geometry to estimate the location of the jet apex. VLBI\ndata were combined with single-dish measurements to search for correlated\nactivity between the radio and $\\gamma$-ray emission. The high-resolution VLBI\nimaging revealed the existence of a spatially bent jet, described by moving and\nstationary features. New jet features are observed to emerge from the core,\naccompanied by flaring activity in radio bands and $\\gamma$ rays. The analysis\nof the transverse jet width profile constrains the location of the mm core to\nlie $\\leq$ 2 pc downstream of the jet apex, and also reveals the existence of a\ntransition from parabolic to conical jet expansion at a distance of $\\sim$54 pc\nfrom the core, corresponding to $\\sim$1.5$\\times$10$^{\\rm 6}$ Schwarzschild\nradii. The cross-correlation analysis reveals a strong correlation between the\nradio and $\\gamma$-ray data, with the 1 mm emission lagging $\\sim$49 days\nbehind the $\\gamma$ rays.

However, there are also studies that believe this is the wrong research\ndirection because intuitively the task of the discriminator focuses on\nseparating the real samples from the generated ones, making features extracted\nin this way useless for most of the downstream tasks. To avoid this dilemma, we\nfirst conducted a thorough theoretical analysis of the relationship between the\ndiscriminator task and the features extracted. We found that the connection\nbetween the task of the discriminator and the feature is not as strong as was\nthought, for that the main factor restricting the feature learned by the\ndiscriminator is not the task, but is the need to prevent the entire GAN model\nfrom mode collapse during the training. From this perspective and combined with\nfurther analyses, we found that to avoid mode collapse, the features extracted\nby the discriminator are not guided to be different for the real samples, but\ndivergence without noise is indeed allowed and occupies a large proportion of\nthe feature space. This makes the features more robust and helps answer the\nquestion as to why the discriminator can succeed as a feature extractor in\nrelated research. Consequently, to expose the essence of the discriminator\nextractor as different from other extractors, we analyze the counterpart of the\ndiscriminator extractor, the classifier extractor that assigns the target\nsamples to different categories. We found the performance of the discriminator\nextractor may be inferior to the classifier based extractor when the source\nclassification task is similar to the target task, which is the common case,\nbut the ability to avoid noise prevents the discriminator from being replaced\nby the classifier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 13:59:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 07:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-06"}

In this paper, we propose a multiframe-based\nadaptive despeckling (MADS) algorithm to reconstruct a high-resolution B-mode\nimage from raw radio-frequency (RF) data that is based on a multiple input\nsingle output (MISO) model. As a prior step to despeckling, the speckle pattern\nin each frame is estimated using a novel multiframe-based adaptive approach for\nultrasonic speckle noise estimation (MSNE) based on a single input multiple\noutput (SIMO) modeling of consecutive deconvolved ultrasound image frames. The\nelegance of the proposed despeckling algorithm is that it addresses the\ndespeckling problem by completely following the signal generation model unlike\nconventional ad-hoc smoothening or filtering based approaches, and therefore,\nit is likely to maximally preserve the image features. As deconvolution is a\nnecessary pre-processing step to despeckling, we describe here a 2-D extension\nof the SIMO model-based 1-D deconvolution method.

Choosing the temporal mean of the time series as the\nfeature for classification, the linear transformation of the network with\nsubsequent thresholding is equivalent to the classical perceptron. Here we show\nthat choosing covariances of time series as the feature for classification maps\nthe neural network to what we call a 'covariance perceptron'; a mapping between\ncovariances that is bilinear in terms of weights.

In\nthe upper crust, prominent low Vp anomalies are found beneath the main volcanic\ncenters, indicating the presence of magma and melt beneath the southern Puna\nplateau. In the lowlands to the southeast of the Puna plateau, below the\nSierras Pampeanas, a high Vp body is observed in the crust. Beneath the Moho at\naround 90 km depth, a strong high Vp anomaly is detected just west of the giant\nbackarc Cerro Galan Ignimbrite caldera with the robustness of this feature\nbeing confirmed by multiple synthetic tests. This high velocity body can be\ninterpreted as a delaminated block of lower crust and uppermost mantle\nlithosphere under the southern Puna plateau. The low velocities in the crust\ncan be interpreted as having been induced by the delamination event that\ntriggered the rise of fluids and melts into the crust and induced the high\ntopography in this part of the plateau.

It is an open-source PACS archive that, on the one hand,\nprovides a comprehensive view of the PACS and DICOM technologies and, on the\nother hand, provides the user with tools to easily expand its core\nfunctionalities. This paper describes the Dicoogle framework, with particular\nemphasis in its Learning Pack package, the resources available and the impact\nof the platform in research and academia. It starts by presenting an overview\nof its architectural concept, the most recent research backed up by Dicoogle,\nsome remarks obtained from its use in teaching, and worldwide usage statistics\nof the software. Moreover, a comparison between the Dicoogle platform and the\nmost popular open-source PACS in the market is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 15:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

In this paper, we propose a new approach on pinning control design\nfor global stabilization of BNs based on BNs' network structure, named as\nnetwork-structure-based distributed pinning control. By deleting the minimum\nnumber of edges, the network structure becomes acyclic. Then, an efficient\ndistributed pinning control is designed to achieve global stabilization.\nCompared with existing literature, the design of pinning control is not based\non the state transition matrix of BNs. Hence, the computational complexity in\nthis paper is reduced from $O(2^n\\times 2^n)$ to $O(2\\times 2^K)$, where $n$ is\nthe number of nodes and $K\\leq n$ is the largest number of in-neighbors of\nnodes. In addition, without using state transition matrix, global state\ninformation is no longer needed, the design of pinning control is just based on\nneighbors' local information, which is easier to be implemented. The proposed\nmethod is well demonstrated by several biological networks with different\nsizes. The results are shown to be simple and concise, while the traditional\npinning control can not be applied for BNs with such a large dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 14:34:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2020 03:30:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

Synaptic signaling is a natural implementation of this\nparadigm. It is responsible for relaying information from one neuron to\nanother, but also provides support for complex functionalities, such as\nlearning and memory. Many of its features are not yet understood, some are,\nhowever, known to be critical for robust, reliable neural communication. In\nparticular, some synapses feature a re-uptake mechanism at the presynaptic\nneuron, which provides a means for removing neurotransmitters from the synaptic\ncleft and for recycling them for future reuse. In this paper, we develop a\ncomprehensive channel model for synaptic DMC encompassing a spatial model of\nthe synaptic cleft, molecule re-uptake at the presynaptic neuron, and\nreversible binding to individual receptors at the postsynaptic neuron. Based on\nthis model, we derive an analytical time domain expression for the channel\nimpulse response (CIR) of the synaptic DMC system. Our model explicitly\nincorporates macroscopic physical channel parameters and can be used to\nevaluate the impact of re-uptake, receptor density, and channel width on the\nCIR of the synaptic DMC system. Furthermore, we provide results from\nparticlebased computer simulation, which validate the analytical model. The\nproposed comprehensive channel model for synaptic DMC systems can be exploited\nfor the investigation of challenging problems, like the quantification of the\ninter-symbol interference between successive synaptic signals and the design of\nsynthetic neural communication systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 11:08:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 10:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

In recent years,\nalignments have proven extremely useful in calculating conformance statistics.\nMost techniques to compute alignments provide an exact solution. However, in\nmany applications, it is enough to have an approximation of the conformance\nvalue. Specifically, for large event data, the computing time for alignments is\nconsiderably long using current techniques which makes them inapplicable in\nreality. Also, it is no longer feasible to use standard hardware for complex\nprocesses. Hence, we need techniques that enable us to obtain fast, and at the\nsame time, accurate approximation of the conformance values. This paper\nproposes new approximation techniques to compute approximated conformance\nchecking values close to exact solution values in a faster time. Those methods\nalso provide upper and lower bounds for the approximated alignment value. Our\nexperiments on real event data show that it is possible to improve the\nperformance of conformance checking by using the proposed methods compared to\nusing the state-of-the-art alignment approximation technique.

During these rare and intermittent buckling\nevents, they can break under flexural failure, i.e. when the curvature exceeds\na threshold. Fine-scale massive simulations of both the fluid flow and the\nfiber dynamics are performed to provide statistics on these two fragmentation\nprocesses.
