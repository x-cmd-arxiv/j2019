The OCCER coverts an OCC problem into many regression\nproblems in the original feature space so that each feature of the original\nfeature space is used as the target variable in one of the regression problems.\nOther features are used as the variables on which the dependent variable\ndepends. The errors of regression of a data point by all the regression models\nare used to compute the outlier score of the data point. An extensive\ncomparison of the OCCER algorithm with state-of-the-art OCC algorithms on\nseveral datasets was conducted to show the effectiveness of the this approach.\nWe also demonstrate that the OCCER algorithm can work well with the latent\nfeature space created by autoencoders for image datasets.

One of the high-level tasks in 3D\nscene understanding is semantic segmentation of RGB-Depth images. With the\navailability of RGB-D cameras, it is desired to improve the accuracy of the\nscene understanding process by exploiting the depth features along with the\nappearance features. As depth images are independent of illumination, they can\nimprove the quality of semantic labeling alongside RGB images. Consideration of\nboth common and specific features of these two modalities improves the\nperformance of semantic segmentation. One of the main problems in RGB-Depth\nsemantic segmentation is how to fuse or combine these two modalities to achieve\nmore advantages of each modality while being computationally efficient.\nRecently, the methods that encounter deep convolutional neural networks have\nreached the state-of-the-art results by early, late, and middle fusion\nstrategies. In this paper, an efficient encoder-decoder model with the\nattention-based fusion block is proposed to integrate mutual influences between\nfeature maps of these two modalities. This block explicitly extracts the\ninterdependences among concatenated feature maps of these modalities to exploit\nmore powerful feature maps from RGB-Depth images. The extensive experimental\nresults on three main challenging datasets of NYU-V2, SUN RGB-D, and Stanford\n2D-3D-Semantic show that the proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmodels with respect to computational cost as well as model size.

Both\npossibilities are discussed with scalar as well as vector boson light\nmediators. Further possibilities, such as with a hierarchy of quartic scalar\ncouplings, are also identified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Dec 2019 19:04:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 15:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-07"}

The obtained here SMP family of solutions is\ndefined by positive bare mass $M_0>0$ and positive Kepler mass $M<M_0$, or,\nalternatively, by the standard gravitational radius $\\rho_g$ and mass ratio\n$\\varrho=M/M_0 \\in (0,1)$. The metrics of spacetime have an unavoidable jump at\nthe place of a massive point particle. We also present a proper development of\nthe theory of distribution defined by kernels with a finite jump which appear\nin the solution of SMP. The specific properties of these distributions are used\nfor work with SMP. A series of physical properties of SMP solutions are derived\nand commented.

A variety of methods has been\nproposed to enable scalability, one of which is to exploit structure in the\nkernel matrix.

This paper presents an efficient GP framework, that\nextends structured kernel interpolation methods to GPs with a non-stationary\nphase. We particularly treat mixtures of non-stationary processes, which are\ncommonly used in the context of separation problems e.g. in biomedical signal\nprocessing. Our approach employs multiple sets of non-equidistant inducing\npoints to account for the non-stationarity and retrieve Toeplitz and Kronecker\nstructure in the kernel matrix allowing for efficient inference. Kernel\nlearning is done by optimizing the marginal likelihood, which can be\napproximated efficiently using stochastic trace estimation methods.

Recent work explores neural language models\nto learn user and item representations from user reviews and combines such\nrepresentations with rating information. Most existing convolutional-based\nneural models take pooling immediately after convolution and loses the\ninteraction information between the latent dimension of convolutional feature\nvectors along the way. Moreover, these models usually take all feature vectors\nat higher levels as equal and do not take into consideration that some features\nare more relevant to this specific user-item context. To bridge these gaps,\nthis paper proposes a convolutional quantum-like language model with\nmutual-attention for rating prediction (ConQAR). By introducing a quantum-like\ndensity matrix layer, interactions between latent dimensions of convolutional\nfeature vectors are well captured. With the attention weights learned from the\nmutual-attention layer, final representations of a user and an item absorb\ninformation from both itself and its counterparts for making rating prediction.\nExperiments on two large datasets show that our model outperforms multiple\nstate-of-the-art CNN-based models. We also perform an ablation test to analyze\nthe independent effects of the two components of our model. Moreover, we\nconduct a case study and present visualizations of the quantum probabilistic\ndistributions in one user and one item review document to show that the learned\ndistributions capture meaningful information about this user and item, and can\nbe potentially used as textual profiling of the user and item.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Dec 2019 22:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-30"}

The model describes the motion of\nthe orientation $\\theta_0$ of the LSC as diffusion in a potential which is\npredicted as a function of the shape of the cell from an approximate solutions\nof the Navier-Stokes equations. The model predicts advected oscillation modes,\ndriven by a restoring force created by the non-circular cell cross-section. We\nobserve the predicted lowest-wavenumber mode in which the LSC orientation\n$\\theta_0$ oscillates around a corner, and a slosh angle $\\alpha$ rocks back\nand forth, which is distinct from the higher-wavenumber advected twisting and\nsloshing oscillations found in cylindrical cells.

In the case of\nbimodal wind with a large relative angle, however, the dune extends its crest\nalong the mean wind direction and evolves into an almost straight longitudinal\ndune. Motivated by these observations, we investigate the dynamical stability\nof isolated dunes using the crest line model, where the dune dynamics is\nrepresented by its crest line motion. First, we extend the previous linear\nstability analysis under the unidirectional wind to the case with non-zero\nslant angle between the wind direction and the normal direction of the crest\nline, and show that the stability diagram does not depend on the slant angle.\nSecondly, we examine how the linear stability is affected by the seasonal\nchanges of wind direction in the case of bimodal wind with equal strength and\nduration. For the transverse dune, we find that the stability is virtually the\nsame with that for the unidirectional wind as long as the dune evolution during\na season is small. On the other hand, in the case of the longitudinal dune, the\ndispersions of the growth rates for the perturbation are drastically different\nfrom those of the unidirectional wind, and we find that the largest growth rate\nis always located at $k = 0$. This is because the growth of the perturbation\nwith $k \\ne 0$ is canceled by the alternating wind from opposite sides of the\ncrest line even though it grows during each duration period of the bimodal\nwind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2019 01:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 06:48:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

Conventional\nbeamforming (CB) is robust but has wide beamwidths and high-level sidelobes.\nHigh-resolution methods such as minimum-variance distortionless response (MVDR)\nand subspace-based MUSIC algorithm, produce low sidelobe levels and narrow\nbeamwidths, but are sensitive to signal mismatch and require many snapshots and\nthe knowledge of number of sources. In addition, heteroscedastic noise where\nthe variance varies across observations and sensors due to nonstationary\nenvironments degrades the conventional methods significantly. This paper\nstudies DOA in heteroscedastic noise (HN) environment, where the variance of\nnoise is varied across the snapshots and the antennas. By treating the DOAs as\nrandom variables and the nuisance parameters of the noise variance different\nacross the snapshots and the antennas, multi-snapshot variational line spectral\nestimation (MVALSE) dealing with heteroscedastic noise (MVHN) is proposed,\nwhich automatically estimates the noise variance, nuisance parameters of the\nprior distribution, number of sources, and provides the uncertain degrees of\nDOA estimates.

Inspired by the\ngroup-wise correlation in stereo matching, we propose an average group-wise\ncorrelation similarity measure to construct a lightweight cost volume. This can\nnot only reduce the memory consumption but also reduce the computational burden\nin the cost volume filtering. Based on our effective cost volume\nrepresentation, we propose a cascade 3D U-Net module to regularize the cost\nvolume to further boost the performance.

To date,\ntremendous efforts have been made to advance feature learning from networks,\nincluding the most recent Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) or attention GCN,\nby integrating node content and topology structures. However, all existing\nmethods consider networks as error-free sources and treat feature content in\neach node as independent and equally important to model node relations.

Specifically, J-RFDL\nperforms the robust representation by DL in a factorized compressed space to\neliminate the negative effects of noise and outliers on the results, which can\nalso make the DL process efficient.

The\nheight of the polar cone is several times as large as the neutron star radius.\nThe energy gain due to the gravity of the neutron star in the polar cone\nexceeds the energy loss due to photon diffusion in the azimuthal direction of\nthe cone, and a significant amount of energy is advected to the neutron star\nsurface. Then, the radiation energy carried with the flow should become so\nlarge for the radiation pressure to overcome the magnetic pressure at the\nbottom of the cone. As a result, the matter should expand in the tangential\ndirection along the neutron star surface, dragging the magnetic lines of force,\nand form a mound-like structure. The advected energy to the bottom of the cone\nshould finally be radiated away from the surface of the polar mound and the\nmatter should be settled on the neutron star surface there. From such\nconfigurations, we can expect an X-ray spectrum composed of a multi-color\nblackbody spectrum from the polar cone region and a quasi-single blackbody\nspectrum from the polar mound region.

A combination of a fairly sharp pencil beam and a broad fan beam\nis expected from the polar cone region, while a broad pencil beam is expected\nfrom the polar mound region.

Here, we propose a\nmicroscopic orbitally-resolved description of ferromagnetism in monolayer\nCrI$_3$.

Using numerical calculations, we estimate\nthe exchange interactions in momentum-space, which allows us to restore the\nspin-wave spectrum, as well as estimate the Curie temperature. Contrary to the\nnearest-neighbor effective models, our calculations suggest the presence of\nsharp resonances in the spin-wave spectrum at 5--7 meV, depending on the\nvertical bias voltage.

IoT devices are\nintended to perform very specific tasks, so their networking behavior is\nexpected to be reasonably stable and predictable. Any significant behavioral\ndeviation from the normal patterns would indicate anomalous events. In this\npaper, we present a method to detect anomalous network communications in IoT\nnetworks using a set of sparse autoencoders.

So that, if a\ndevice is compromised only malicious communications can be dropped while the\nservice provided by the device is not totally interrupted. To characterize\nnetwork behavior, bidirectional TCP flows are extracted and described using\nstatistics on the size of the first N packets sent and received, along with\nstatistics on the corresponding inter-arrival times between packets. A set of\nsparse autoencoders is then trained to learn the profile of the legitimate\ncommunications generated by an experimental smart home network.

Such claims may potentially influence public health decisions on a\nnational level.\n  We propose two measures for quantifying the trendiness of trends. Assuming\nthat reality evolves in continuous time we define what constitutes a trend and\na change in trend, and introduce a probabilistic Trend Direction Index. This\nindex has the interpretation of the probability that a latent characteristic\nhas changed monotonicity at any given time conditional on observed data. We\nalso define an index of Expected Trend Instability quantifying the expected\nnumber of changes in trend on an interval.\n  Using a latent Gaussian Process model we show how the Trend Direction Index\nand the Expected Trend Instability can be estimated in a Bayesian framework and\nuse the methods to analyze the proportion of smokers in Denmark during the last\n20 years, and the development of new COVID-19 cases in Italy from February 24th\nonwards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2019 12:05:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2020 20:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

Since SDN is becoming\nthe mainstream paradigm for networks, implementation of a robust fault\ntolerance scheme for SDN-based networks is crucial. Existing SDN data plane\nfault tolerance approaches can be classified as reactive and proactive which\nmay or may not rely on the controller, respectively. However, none of them\nqualifies as a complete solution, providing only partial remedies. In this\nwork, we propose Dynamic Protection with Quality of Alternative Paths (DPQoAP)\nthat considers not only the existing faults within the network but also the\nquality of alternative paths. As a result, we can sustain the QoS throughout\nthe network after the recovery. We also investigate how application based\nparameters are affected by link failures. To this end, we explore the change in\nQuality of Experience (QoE) caused by link failures under different cases using\nDynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) for video streaming. On the other\nhand, even though DASH is proposed as a solution to improve the QoE affected by\nthe dynamic conditions of the networks, it remains insufficient to handle the\ncongested links that show the symptoms of a link failure. Thus, we apply the\ndata plane fault tolerance approach in SDN to improve the QoE of DASH clients\nin the case of congestion as well as the failure. The performance of the\nproposed solutions are evaluated through various experiments considering the\nQoS and QoE parameters. It is observed that DPQoAP enhances the efficiency of\nthe networking operations and adaptability of the applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2019 12:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-26"}

If the\ndifferential inclusion does not depend on time, then the Hamiltonian, evaluated\nalong the optimal state trajectory and the co-state trajectory, is independent\nof time. If the differential inclusion is Lipschitz continuous, then the\nHamitonian, evaluated along the optimal state trajectory and the co-state\ntrajectory, is Lipschitz continuous. These two well-known results are examples\nof the following principle: the Hamiltonian, evaluated along the optimal state\ntrajectory and the co-state trajectory, inherits the regularity properties of\nthe differential inclusion, regarding its time dependence. We show that this\nprinciple also applies to another kind of regularity: if the differential\ninclusion has bounded variation with respect to time, then the Hamiltonian,\nevaluated along the optimal state trajectory and the co-state trajectory, has\nbounded variation. Two applications of these newly found properties are\ndemonstrated. One is to derive improved conditions which guarantee the\nnondegeneracy of necessary conditions of optimality, in the form of a\nHamiltonian inclusion. The other application is to derive new, less\nrestrictive, conditions under which minimizers in the calculus of variations\nhave bounded slope.

Hardware accelerators such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays\n(FPGAs) are a promising solution that can satisfy these requirements for both\nembedded and High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. In FPGAs, as well as\nCPUs and GPUs, aggressive voltage scaling below the nominal level is an\neffective technique for power dissipation minimization.

Additionally, the paper proposes a hybrid\ntraining method which mitigates this negative impact on the accuracy. Using the\nproposed hybrid method, the training can start using approximate multipliers\nthen switches to exact multipliers for the last few epochs. Using this method,\nthe performance benefits of approximate multipliers in terms of speed, power,\nand area can be attained for a large portion of the training stage. On the\nother hand, the negative impact on the accuracy is diminished by using the\nexact multipliers for the last epochs of training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2019 12:50:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Apr 2020 13:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

The solution\nis demanded in various areas like multimedia security, computer vision,\nrobotics, etc. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have encoder-decoder\nstructures possessing the capability to learn pose-independent representation\nincorporated with discriminator network for realistic face synthesis. We\npresent PIGAN, a cyclic shared encoder-decoder framework, in an attempt to\nsolve the problem. As compared to traditional GAN, it consists of secondary\nencoder-decoder framework sharing weights from the primary structure and\nreconstructs the face with the original pose. The primary framework focuses on\ncreating disentangle representation, and secondary framework aims to restore\nthe original face. We use CFP high-resolution, realistic dataset to check the\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2019 02:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-06"}

In the first section of this article, a generic high-speed train\nagainst a turbulent flow is simulated, numerically. The Reynolds-Averaged\nNavier-Stokes (RANS) equations combined with the turbulence model are applied\nto solve incompressible turbulent flow around a high-speed train. Flow\nstructure, velocity and pressure contours and streamlines at some typical wind\ndirections are the most important results of this simulation. The maximum and\nminimum values are specified and discussed. Also, the pressure coefficient for\nsome critical points on the train surface is evaluated. In the following, the\nwind direction influence the aerodynamic key parameters as drag, lift, and side\nforces at the mentioned wind directions are analyzed and compared. Moreover,\nthe effects of velocity changes (50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 m/s) are estimated and\ncompared on the above flow and aerodynamic parameters. In the second section of\nthe paper, various data-driven methods including Gene Expression Programming\n(GEP), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and random forest (RF), are applied\nfor predicting output parameters. So, drag, lift, and side forces and also\nminimum and a maximum of pressure coefficients for mentioned wind directions\nand velocity are predicted and compared using statistical parameters. Obtained\nresults indicated that RF in all coefficients of wind direction and most\ncoefficients of free stream velocity provided the most accurate predictions. As\na conclusion, RF may be recommended for the prediction of aerodynamic\ncoefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Dec 2019 23:34:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}
