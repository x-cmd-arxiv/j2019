In the second approach, the\nsurrounding retinal layers (outer boundary retinal pigment epithelium (OBRPE)\nand Bruch's membrane (BM)) are segmented and the remaining space between these\ntwo layers is extracted as drusen. In this work, we extend the standard U-Net\narchitecture with spatial pyramid pooling components to introduce global\nfeature context.

In this work, we focus on generating\nsynthetic data for deep learning-based visual odometry and SLAM methods that\ntake optical flow as an input. We produce training data in a form of optical\nflow that corresponds to arbitrary camera movement between a real frame and a\nvirtual frame.

We train visual odometry model on\nsynthetic data and do not use ground truth poses hence this model can be\nconsidered unsupervised. Also it can be classified as monocular as we do not\nuse depth maps on inference. We also propose a simple way to convert any visual\nodometry model into a SLAM method based on frame matching and graph\noptimization.

While the capacity of the\nmulti-antenna (Gaussian) BC with perfect CSIT is known and achieved by Dirty\nPaper Coding (DPC), the capacity and the capacity-achieving strategy of the\nmulti-antenna BC with imperfect CSIT remain unknown. Conventional approaches\ntherefore rely on applying communication strategies designed for perfect CSIT\nto the imperfect CSIT setting. In this work, we break this conventional routine\nand make two major contributions. First, we show that linearly precoded\nRate-Splitting (RS), relying on the split of messages into common and private\nparts and linear precoding at the transmitter, and successive interference\ncancellation at the receivers, can achieve larger rate regions than DPC in\nmulti-antenna BC with partial CSIT.

Gaining benefits from the\ncapability of RS to partially decode the interference and partially treat\ninterference as noise, DPCRS is less sensitive to CSIT inaccuracies, networks\nloads and user deployments compared with DPC and other existing transmission\nstrategies.

One of the challenges of\nthe C statistic is that its probability distribution, under the null hypothesis\nthat the data follow a parent model, is not known exactly. Such distribution is\nneeded for model testing, namely to determine the acceptability of models and\nthen to determine confidence intervals of model parameters. This is in contrast\nwith the accurate knowledge, for Gaussian data, of the $\\chi^2$ statistic for\nany number of free parameters in the parent model.\n  This paper presents an effort towards improving our understanding of the C\nstatistic by studying (a) the distribution of for a fully specified model, (b)\nthe distribution of $C_{min}$ resulting from a maximum-likelihood fit to a\nsimple one-parameter constant model, i.e., a model that represents the sample\nmean of $N$ Poisson measurements, and (c) the distribution of the associated\n$\\Delta C$ statistic that is used for parameter estimation. The results confirm\nthe expectation that, in the high-count limit, both statistics have the same\nmean and variance as a $\\chi^2$ statistic with same number of degrees of\nfreedom. It is also found that, in the low-count regime, the expectation of the\nC statistic can be substantially lower than for a $\\chi^2$ distribution. These\nresult have implications for hypothesis testing in the low-count Poisson regime\nthat are also discussed in the paper.\n  The paper makes use of recent X-ray observations of the astronomical source\nPG 1116+215 to illustrate the application of the C statistic to Poisson data.\nThese measurements are also used to identify biases in the use of the $\\chi^2$\nstatistic for Poisson data, especially in the low-count regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 16:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-12"}

By integrating all available data sources, we seek to\ndiscover common group structure among the samples that may be hidden in\nindividualistic cluster analyses of a single data-view. While several\ntechniques for such integrative clustering have been explored, we propose and\ndevelop a convex formalization that will inherit the strong statistical,\nmathematical and empirical properties of increasingly popular convex clustering\nmethods. Specifically, our Integrative Generalized Convex Clustering\nOptimization (iGecco) method employs different convex distances, losses, or\ndivergences for each of the different data views with a joint convex fusion\npenalty that leads to common groups. Additionally, integrating mixed multi-view\ndata is often challenging when each data source is high-dimensional. To perform\nfeature selection in such scenarios, we develop an adaptive shifted group-lasso\npenalty that selects features by shrinking them towards their loss-specific\ncenters. Our so-called iGecco+ approach selects features from each data-view\nthat are best for determining the groups, often leading to improved integrative\nclustering. To fit our model, we develop a new type of generalized multi-block\nADMM algorithm using sub-problem approximations that more efficiently fits our\nmodel for big data sets. Through a series of numerical experiments and real\ndata examples on text mining and genomics, we show that iGecco+ achieves\nsuperior empirical performance for high-dimensional mixed multi-view data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 16:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-12"}

Since forwarding bandwidth-hungry elephant flows (EFs) and\ndelay-sensitive mice flows (MFs) on the same path can cause severe performance\ndegradation, the LightFDG optically grooms flows of each class into\nrack-to-rack (R2R) flows. Then, R2R-MF and R2R-EF flows are separately\nforwarded over lightpaths of separate MF and EF virtual topologies,\nrespectively. Lightpaths are provisioned by jointly determining the capacity\nand route based on flows' arrival rate, size, and completion time request. To\nprevent EFs from congesting the MF lightpaths, high speed and accurate\nflow-detection mechanisms are also necessary for classifying EFs as soon as\npossible. Therefore, a fast-lightweight-and-accurate flow detection framework\nis developed by leveraging the transmission control protocol (TCP) behaviors.\nThe proposed FD scheme has the flexibility of being implemented as in-network\nor centralized to classify flows of modifiable and unmodifiable hosts,\nrespectively. Since the centralized scheme incurs considerable overhead, the\nprocessing and communication overhead is also mitigated by proposed techniques.\nNumerical results show that LightFDG outperforms traditional load balancers by\nabout 3x for EFs and 10x for MFs. Along with the developed overhead mitigation\nmethods, the centralized scheme is shown to provide up to 62x lower overhead\nwith 100% accuracy and with about 224x higher detection speeds than the\nexisting centralized solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 17:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-12"}

Prominent among these are multi-target tracking, where one\nmust combine observations from different sensor types in a meaningful way to\ntrack multiple targets. Because sensors have differing error models, we seek a\ntheoretically-justified quantification of the agreement among ensembles of\nsensors, both overall for a sensor collection, and also at a fine-grained level\nspecifying pairwise and multi-way interactions among sensors. We demonstrate\nthat the theory of mathematical sheaves provides a unified answer to this need,\nsupporting both quantitative and qualitative data. The theory provides\nalgorithms to globalize data across the network of deployed sensors, and to\ndiagnose issues when the data do not globalize cleanly. We demonstrate the\nutility of sheaf-based tracking models based on experimental data of a wild\npopulation of black bears in Asheville, North Carolina. A measurement model\ninvolving four sensors deployed among the bears and the team of scientists\ncharged with tracking their location is deployed. This provides a sheaf-based\nintegration model which is small enough to fully interpret, but of sufficient\ncomplexity to demonstrate the sheaf's ability to recover a holistic picture of\nthe locations and behaviors of both individual bears and the bear-human\ntracking system. A statistical approach was developed for comparison, a dynamic\nlinear model which was estimated using a Kalman filter. This approach also\nrecovered bear and human locations and sensor accuracies. When the observations\nare normalized into a common coordinate system, the structure of the dynamic\nlinear observation model recapitulates the structure of the sheaf model,\ndemonstrating the canonicity of the sheaf-based approach. But when the\nobservations are not so normalized, the sheaf model still remains valid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 17:33:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-12"}

This work describes a\nnovel membrane-based microfiltration device comprised of a fully automated\nsample processing unit and a machine-vision-enabled imaging system that allows\nthe efficient isolation and rapid analysis of CTCs from blood. The device\nperformance was characterized using four prostate cancer cell lines, including\nPC-3, VCaP, DU-145, and LNCaP, obtaining high assay reproducibility and capture\nefficiencies greater than 93% after processing 7.5 mL blood samples from\nhealthy donors, spiked with 100 cancer cells. Cancer cells remained viable\nafter filtration due to the minimal shear stress exerted over cells during the\nprocedure, while the identification of cancer cells by immunostaining was not\naffected by the number of non-specific events captured on the membrane. We were\nalso able to identify the androgen receptor (AR) point mutation T878A from 7.5\nmL blood samples spiked with 50 LNCaP cells using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing.\nFinally, CTCs were detected in 8 of 8 samples from patients diagnosed with\nmetastatic prostate cancer (mean $\\pm$ SEM = 21 $\\pm$ 2.957 CTCs/mL, median =\n21 CTC/mL), thereby validating the potential clinical utility of the device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 18:05:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-07"}

EEG data collected during fMRI acquisition are contaminated with\nMRI gradients and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts, in addition to artifacts\nof physiological origin. There have been several attempts for reducing these\nartifacts with manual and time-consuming pre-processing, which may result in\nbiasing EEG data due to variations in selecting steps order, parameters, and\nclassification of artifactual independent components. Thus, there is a strong\nurge to develop a fully automatic and comprehensive pipeline for reducing all\nmajor EEG artifacts. In this work, we introduced an open-access toolbox with a\nfully automatic pipeline for reducing artifacts from EEG data collected\nsimultaneously with fMRI (refer to APPEAR). Approach. The pipeline integrates\naverage template subtraction and independent component analysis (ICA) to\nsuppress both MRI-related and physiological artifacts. To validate our results,\nwe tested APPEAR on EEG data recorded from healthy control subjects during\nresting-state (n=48) and task-based (i.e., event-related-potentials [ERP]; n=8)\nparadigms. The chosen gold standard is an expert manual review of the EEG\ndatabase. Main results.

This process, which necessarily involves making assumptions,\nintroduces the potential for mismatches between the theoretical understanding\nof the construct purported to be measured and its operationalization.

Two HNLs or more could successfully explain the observed neutrino\nmasses through the seesaw mechanism. If, in addition, they are\nquasi-degenerate, they could be responsible for the baryon asymmetry of the\nUniverse. Depending on their mass splitting, HNLs can have very different\nphenomenologies: they can behave as Majorana fermions -- with lepton number\nviolating (LNV) signatures, such as same-sign dilepton decays -- or as Dirac\nfermions with only lepton number conserving (LNC) signatures. In this work, we\nquantitatively demonstrate that LNV processes can be distinguished from LNC\nones at SHiP, using only the angular distribution of the HNL decay products.\nAccounting for spin correlations in the simulation and using boosted decision\ntrees for discrimination, we show that SHiP will be able to distinguish\nMajorana-like and Dirac-like HNLs in a significant fraction of the currently\nunconstrained parameter space. If the mass splitting is of order $10^{-6}$ eV,\nSHiP could even be capable of resolving HNL oscillations, thus providing a\ndirect measurement of the mass splitting.

The standard solution is to view nebulae as\naggregates of dense regions of constant density in an otherwise empty void.\nThis porosity is parametrized by a filling factor $f<1$. Similarly, abundance\nand temperature discrepancies between optical recombination lines (ORLs) and\nCELs are often explained by invoking a dual delta distribution of a dense,\ncool, metal-rich component immersed in a diffuse, warm, metal-poor plasma. In\nthis paper, we examine the possibility that the observational diagnostics that\nlead to such discrepancies can be produced by a realistic distribution of\ndensity and temperature fluctuations, such as might arise in plasma turbulence.\nWe produce simulated nebulae with density and temperature fluctuations\ndescribed by various probability distribution functions (pdfs). Standard\nastronomical diagnostics are applied to these simulated observations to derive\nestimates of nebular densities, temperatures, and abundances. Our results show\nthat for plausible density pdfs the simulated observations lead to filling\nfactors in the observed range. None of our simulations satisfactorily reproduce\nthe abundance discrepancy factors (ADFs) in planetary nebulae, although there\nis possible consistency with \\ion{H}{ii} regions. Compared to the case of\ndensity-only and temperature-only fluctuations, a positive correlation between\ndensity and temperature reduces the filling factor and ADF (from optical CELs),\nwhereas a negative correlation increases both, eventually causing the filling\nfactor to exceed unity. This result suggests that real observations can provide\nconstraints on the thermodynamics of small scale fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 17:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-20"}

We\ncreate three-dimensional hydrodynamic models of binary coalescences, and follow\nthem through a phase of increasing Roche lobe overflow until the accretor is\nengulfed by the donor at the onset of a common envelope phase. In these models,\nwe vary binary properties of mass ratio, donor structure and spin, and equation\nof state through the gas adiabatic index. We compare the numerical results to\nsemi-analytic models of binary orbit evolution based on mass and angular\nmomentum exchange between two point masses. Using our hydrodynamic simulations,\nwe measure the key parameters: the donor mass loss rate and the angular\nmomentum exchanged per unit mass loss from the donor. Using these calibrations,\nthe semi-analytic model closely reproduces the escalating mass loss and runaway\norbital decay observed in the hydrodynamic models. The semi-analytic model\naccurately reproduces the major differences in orbit evolution that arise with\nvarying mass ratio and donor structure. We encapsulate the semi-analytic model\nin a publicly-released python package RLOF. We apply this model to the observed\nperiod decay and subsequent merger of the binary V1309 Sco, and find that it\ncan simultaneously reproduce the observed orbital decay and time of outburst.\nWe further demonstrate that there is a relationship between period derivative\nand second derivative that can be a useful metric for evaluating candidate\nmerging binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 13:40:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

We use Herschel PACS and ALMA Band 7 observations of the hydroxyl\nmolecule (OH) line at rest-frame wavelength 119 $\\mu$m which in absorption can\nprovide unambiguous evidence for inflows or outflows of molecular gas in\nnuclear regions of galaxies. Our study contributes to double the number of OH\nobservations of luminous systems at $z\\sim0.2-0.3$, and push the search for\nmolecular outflows based on the OH transition to $z\\sim6$.\n  Results. We detect OH high-velocity absorption wings in three of the four\nULIRGs. In two cases, IRAS F20036-1547 and IRAS F13352+6402, the blueshifted\nabsorption profiles indicate the presence of powerful and fast molecular gas\noutflows.

The process whereby large\nstar-forming galaxies quench and join the quiescent population at the large\nsize end has also been suggested as an explanation for this size growth. Given\nthe clear association of quenching with clusters, we explore this mechanism by\nstudying the structural properties of 23 spectroscopically identified recently\nquenched (or \"poststarburst\" (PSB)) cluster galaxies at $z\\sim1$. Despite clear\nPSB spectral signatures implying rapid and violent quenching, 87\\% of these\ngalaxies have symmetric, undisturbed morphologies in the stellar continuum.\nRemarkably, they follow a mass-size relation lying midway between the\nstar-forming and quiescent field relations, with sizes $0.1$ dex smaller than\n$z\\sim1$ star-forming galaxies at log$(M_{*}/M_{\\odot})=10.5$. This implies a\nrapid change in the light profile without directly effecting the stellar\ndistribution, suggesting changes in the mass-to-light ratio gradients across\nthe galaxy are responsible. We develop fading toy models to explore how\nstar-forming galaxies move across the mass-size plane as their stellar\npopulations fade to match those of the PSBs. \"Outside-in\" fading has the\npotential to reproduce the contraction in size and increase in bulge-dominance\nobserved between star-forming and PSB cluster galaxies. Since cluster PSBs lie\non the large size end of the quiescent mass-size relation, and our previous\nwork shows cluster galaxies are smaller than field galaxies, the sizes of\nquiescent galaxies must grow both from the quenching of star-forming galaxies\nand dry minor mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 21:40:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-09"}

We develop a simple\nanalytic model for the cluster mass-radius relation. We consider a galaxy disc\nin hydrostatic equilibrium, which hosts a population of molecular clouds that\nfragment into clumps undergoing cluster formation and feedback-driven\nexpansion. The model predicts a mass-radius relation of $R_{\\star} \\propto\nM_{\\star}^{1/2}$ and a dependence on the kpc-scale gas surface density\n$R_{\\star} \\propto \\Sigma_{\\rm g}^{-1/2}$, which results from the formation of\nmore compact clouds (and cluster-forming clumps within) at higher gas surface\ndensities. This environmental dependence implies that the high-pressure\nenvironments in which the most massive clusters can form also induce the\nformation of clusters with the smallest radii, thereby shallowing the observed\nMRR at high-masses towards the observed $R_{\\star} \\propto M_{\\star}^{1/3}$. At\nlow cluster masses, relaxation-driven expansion induces a similar shallowing of\nthe MRR. We combine our predicted MRR with a simple population synthesis model\nand apply it to a variety of star-forming environments, finding good agreement.\nOur model predicts that the high-pressure formation environments of globular\nclusters at high redshift naturally led to the formation of clusters that are\nconsiderably more compact than those in the local Universe, thereby increasing\ntheir resilience to tidal shock-driven disruption and contributing to their\nsurvival until the present day.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 19:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 15:53:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

For the\nsingle-burst actuation case, surface pressure signals were correlated with the\nflowfield observations of the roll-up and convection of a large-scale vortex\nstructure that follows the actuator burst input. A spatially localized region\nof high pressure occurs below and slightly upstream of a \"kink\" that forms in\nthe shear layer, which is responsible for the lift reversal that occurs within\n$2.0t^+$ after the burst signal was triggered. Proper orthogonal decomposition\nof the single-burst flow field shows that the time-varying coefficients of the\nfirst two modes correlate with the negative of the lift coefficient and\npitching moment coefficient. The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) of the\nsingle-burst flow field data identified the modes related to the kinetic energy\ngrowth of the disturbance. The mode with the largest growth rate had a Strouhal\nnumber close to that associated with the separation bubble dynamics. However,\nwhen multiple bursts are used to control the separation, the interactions\nbetween the bursts were observed which depend on the time intervals between the\nbursts. The convolution integral and DMD were performed on the multi-burst flow\nfield datasets. The results indicate that the nonlinear burst-burst interaction\nonly affects the reverse flow strength within the separation bubble, which is\nrelated to the main trend of the lift. On the other hand, the linear\nburst-burst interaction contributes to the high-frequency lift variation\nassociated with the bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 19:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-13"}

Outflows are\nassociated with star formation across the entire stellar mass spectrum. In this\nreview, we describe the observational, theoretical, and computational advances\non magnetized outflows, and their role in the formation of disks and stars of\nall masses in turbulent, magnetized clouds. The ability of torques exerted on\ndisks by magnetized winds to efficiently extract and transport disk angular\nmomentum was developed in early theoretical models and confirmed by a variety\nof numerical simulations. The recent high resolution ALMA observations of disks\nand outflows now confirm several key aspects of these ideas, e.g. that jets\nrotate and originate from large regions of their underlying disks. New insights\non accretion disk physics show that magneto-rotational instability (MRI)\nturbulence is strongly damped, leaving magnetized disk winds as the dominant\nmechanism for transporting disk angular momentum. This has major consequences\nfor star formation, as well as planet formation. Outflows also play an\nimportant role in feedback processes particularly in the birth of low mass\nstars and cluster formation.

As we move towards advanced spectrum sharing\nmethodologies involving billions of devices connected over wireless networks,\nit is essential to secure the wireless signal such that only the intended\nreceiver can realize the properties of the signal. In this paper, we propose\nRand-OFDM, a new waveform, secured with a shared secret key, where the signal\nproperties can be recovered only at the expected receiver. We achieve the\nsignal level security by modifying the OFDM signal in time-domain, thus erasing\nthe OFDM properties and in turn obfuscating the signal properties to an\neavesdropper. We introduce a key-based secured training signal for channel\nestimation, which can be used only at the intended receiver with prior\nknowledge of the key. As a final step for the recovery of the signal, we use a\nclustering-based technique to correct the phase of the received signal. Our\ncryptanalysis shows that Rand-OFDM is especially useful in future wideband\nsignals. Extensive simulation and over-the-air experiments show that the\nperformance of Rand-OFDM is comparable to legacy OFDM and SNR penalty due to\nthe secured waveform varies between 1-4dB. In all these scenarios, Rand-OFDM\nremains unrecognized by the adversary even at the highest possible SNR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 20:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-13"}

In the standard scenario they evolve on timescales ~Myr due to the\nviscous transport of angular momentum. The analytical self-similar solution for\ntheir evolution predicts also specific disc isochrones in the accretion rate -\ndisc mass plane. However, photoevaporation by radiation emitted by the central\nstar is likely to dominate the gas disc dispersal of the innermost region,\nintroducing another (shorter) timescale for this process. In this paper, we\ninclude the effect of internal (X and EUV) photoevaporation on the disc\nevolution, finding numerical solutions for a population of protoplanetary\ndiscs. Our models naturally reproduce the expected quick dispersal of the inner\nregion of discs when their accretion rates match the rate of photoevaporative\nmass loss, in line with previous studies. We find that photoevaporation\npreferentially removes the lightest discs in the sample. The net result is\nthat, counter-intuitively, photoevaporation increases the average disc mass in\nthe sample, by dispersing the lightest discs. At the same time,\nphotoevaporation also reduces the mass accretion rate by cutting the supply of\nmaterial from the outer to the inner disc. In a purely viscous framework, this\nwould be interpreted as the result of a longer viscous evolution, leading to an\noverestimate of the disc age. Our results thus show that photoevaporation is a\nnecessary ingredient to include when interpreting observations of large disc\nsamples with measured mass accretion rates and disc masses. Photoevaporation\nleaves a characteristic imprint on the shape of the isochrone. Accurate data in\nthe accretion rate - disc mass plane in the low disc mass region therefore give\nclues on the typical photoevaporation rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 21:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Consequently, the capability of learning\nalgorithms to work with large amounts of data has become a crucial scientific\nand technological challenge for their practical applicability. Hence, it is no\nsurprise that large-scale learning is currently drawing plenty of research\neffort in the machine learning research community. In this thesis, we focus on\nkernel methods, a theoretically sound and effective class of learning\nalgorithms yielding nonparametric estimators. Kernel methods, in their\nclassical formulations, are accurate and efficient on datasets of limited size,\nbut do not scale up in a cost-effective manner. Recent research has shown that\napproximate learning algorithms, for instance random subsampling methods like\nNystr\\\"om and random features, with time-memory-accuracy trade-off mechanisms\nare more scalable alternatives. In this thesis, we provide analyses of the\ngeneralization properties and computational requirements of several types of\nsuch approximation schemes. In particular, we expose the tight relationship\nbetween statistics and computations, with the goal of tailoring the accuracy of\nthe learning process to the available computational resources. Our results are\nsupported by experimental evidence on large-scale datasets and numerical\nsimulations. We also study how large-scale learning can be applied to enable\naccurate, efficient, and reactive lifelong learning for robotics. In\nparticular, we propose algorithms allowing robots to learn continuously from\nexperience and adapt to changes in their operational environment. The proposed\nmethods are validated on the iCub humanoid robot in addition to other\nbenchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 21:08:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-13"}

The process of music-to-image translation poses unique challenges,\nmainly due to the unstable mapping between the different modalities involved in\nthis process. In this paper, we employ a trainable cross-modal translation\nmethod to overcome this limitation, leading to the first, to the best of our\nknowledge, deep learning method for generating sentiment-aware visual stories.\nVarious aspects of the proposed method are extensively evaluated and discussed\nusing different songs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 21:46:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-13"}

The accurate localization, which only the\nEM emission can provide, also indicates the astrophysical setting in which the\nmerger took place. In addition, the combination of the two signals provides\nconstraints on the nature of gravity and on the expansion rate of the Universe.\nThe first detection of a binary neutron star merger by the LIGO-Virgo\ncollaboration, GW170817, initiated the era of multi-messenger GW-EM\nastrophysics and demonstrated the great promise it holds.

This paper\npresents high-temperature characteristics of depletion-mode molybdenum trioxide\n(MoO${_3}$)-gated InAlN/GaN-on-silicon HEMTs in air. After a room temperature\noxidation of the Mo for 10 weeks, the leakage of the HEMT is reduced over 60\ntimes compared to the as-deposited Mo. The use of MoO${_3}$ as the Schottky\ngate material enables low gate leakage, resulting in a high ON/OFF current\nratio of 1.2 x 10${^8}$ at 25{\\deg}C and 1.2 x 10${^5}$ at 300{\\deg}C in air.\nAt 400{\\deg}C, gate control of the InAlN/GaN two-dimensional electron gas\n(2DEG) channel is lost and unrecoverable.

The suppression of gate\nleakage via Mo oxidation and resulting high ON/OFF ratio paves the way for\nviable high-temperature GaN-based electronics that can function beyond the\nthermal limit of silicon once proper passivation is achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 22:12:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-13"}

Under a resonant driving field the Rydberg-Rydberg interaction in\nhigh-lying states can induce shifts in the atomic resonance such that a\nsecondary Rydberg excitation becomes unlikely leading to the Rydberg blockade\neffect. In a related effect, off-resonant coupling of light to Rydberg states\nof atoms contributes to the Rydberg anti-blockade effect where the Rydberg\ninteraction creates a resonant condition that promotes a secondary excitation\nin a Rydberg atomic gas. Here, we study the light-matter interaction and\ndynamics of off-resonant two-photon excitations and include two- and three-atom\nRydberg interactions and their effect on excited state dynamics in an ensemble\nof cold atoms. In an experimentally-motivated regime, we find the optimal\nphysical parameters such as Rabi frequencies, two-photon detuning, and pump\nduration to achieve significant enhancement in the probability of generating\ndoubly-excited collective atomic states. This results in large auto-correlation\nvalues due to the Rydberg anti-blockade effect and makes this system a\npotential candidate for a high-purity two-photon Fock state source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 22:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-13"}

We develop\nmathematical models of the biomechanics of the tube feet and the sea star body.\nIn the model, the feet are coupled mechanically through their structural\nconnection to a rigid body. We formulate hierarchical control laws that capture\nsalient features of the sea star nervous system.

To minimize\nthe collective cost of task accomplishments in a distributed manner, a\ngame-theoretic solution is introduced to couple agents from complementary\nteams. We utilize market-based negotiation models to develop incentive-based\ndecision-making algorithms relying on innovative notions of \"certainty and\nuncertainty profit margins\". The simulation results demonstrate that employing\ntwo complementary teams of hunters and gatherers can effectually improve the\nnumber of tasks completed by agents compared to conventional methods, while the\ncollective cost of accomplishments is minimized. In addition, the stability and\nefficacy of the proposed solutions are studied using Nash equilibrium analysis\nand statistical analysis respectively. It is also numerically shown that the\nproposed solutions function fairly, i.e. for each type of agent, the overall\nworkload is distributed equally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 03:13:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 22:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-30"}

Earth-sized planets orbiting\nTRAPPIST-1 likely have either a clear or a cloudy/hazy hydrogen-poor\natmosphere. In this paper, we investigate whether a proposed formation scenario\nis consistent with expected atmospheric compositions of the TRAPPIST-1 planets.\nWe examine the amount of a hydrogen-rich gas that TRAPPIST-1-like planets\naccreted from the ambient disk until disk dispersal. Since TRAPPIST-1 planets\nare trapped into a resonant chain, we simulate disk gas accretion onto a\nmigrating TRAPPIST-1-like planet. We find that the amount of an accreted\nhydrogen-rich gas is as small as 10$^{-2}$ wt% and 0.1 wt% for TRAPPIST-1b and\n1c, 10$^{-2}$ wt% for 1d, 1 wt% for 1e, a few wt% for 1f and 1g and 1 wt% for\n1h, respectively. We also calculate a long-term thermal evolution of\nTRAPPIST-1-like planets after disk dissipation and estimate the mass loss of\ntheir hydrogen-rich atmospheres driven by a stellar X-ray and UV irradiation.\nWe find that all the accreted hydrogen-rich atmospheres can be lost via\nhydrodynamic escape.

In this paper, we\nsystematically investigate the origin of such X-ray emission within the\nframework of the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) around a weakly\nmagnetized NS, in which the thermal soft X-ray component arises from the\nsurface of the NS and the power-law component arises from the ADAF itself.

The fact that diffuse intensities of high-energy\nneutrinos, ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays, and GeV-TeV gamma rays are all\ncomparable suggests that these messengers are physically connected. The IceCube\ndata above 100 TeV energies can be naturally explained by cosmic-ray reservoir\nmodels. In particular, starburst galaxies and galaxy clusters/groups serve as\nnatural storage rooms of cosmic rays, and it has been theoretically predicted\nthat these sources are promising sites of high-energy neutrinos and gamma rays\nthat are produced via inelastic pp interactions. Indeed, the predictions made\nbefore the discovery of IceCube neutrinos are consistent with the current\nhigh-energy neutrino data measured in IceCube, and that they could give a\ngrand-unified view of sub-PeV neutrinos, sub-TeV gamma rays, and\nultrahigh-energy cosmic rays. These unified models have strong prediction\npowers, which can be tested by next-generation neutrino detectors such as\nIceCube-Gen2 as well as gamma-ray telescopes such as CTA. The recent\nobservations have also shown that the 10-100 TeV diffuse neutrino flux is\nhigher than that at PeV energies, which suggests that they come from a\ndifferent class of neutrino sources. The detailed comparison with the diffuse\nisotropic gamma-ray background measured by Fermi has revealed that these\nmedium-energy neutrinos are likely to come from hidden cosmic-ray accelerators,\nfrom which neutrinos can escape while GeV-TeV gamma rays are attenuated. The\ncandidate source classes are choked gamma-ray burst jets and active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) cores. In particular, the AGN corona model predicts a unique\nconnection between 10-100 TeV neutrinos and MeV gamma rays, which can be\nrobustly tested with future MeV gamma-ray missions such as AMEGO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 04:11:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

In this paper, we introduce a new variant\nof crowd counting problem, namely \"Categorized Crowd Counting\", that counts the\nnumber of people sitting and standing in a given image. Categorized crowd\ncounting has many real-world applications such as crowd monitoring, customer\nservice, and resource management. The major challenges in categorized crowd\ncounting come from high occlusion, perspective distortion and the seemingly\nidentical upper body posture of sitting and standing persons. Existing density\nmap based approaches perform well to approximate a large crowd, but lose\nimportant local information necessary for categorization. On the other hand,\ntraditional detection-based approaches perform poorly in occluded environments,\nespecially when the crowd size gets bigger. Hence, to solve the categorized\ncrowd counting problem, we develop a novel attention-based deep learning\nframework that addresses the above limitations. In particular, our approach\nworks in three phases: i) We first generate basic detection based sitting and\nstanding density maps to capture the local information; ii) Then, we generate a\ncrowd counting based density map as global counting feature; iii) Finally, we\nhave a cross-branch segregating refinement phase that splits the crowd density\nmap into final sitting and standing density maps using attention mechanism.\nExtensive experiments show the efficacy of our approach in solving the\ncategorized crowd counting problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 04:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-13"}

This paper presents a novel framework that uses PointNet encoding\nto align point clouds and perform registration for applications such as 3D\nreconstruction, tracking and pose estimation. We develop a framework that\ncompares PointNet features of template and source point clouds to find the\ntransformation that aligns them accurately.

An important example is truncation models, in which\nobserved pairs are restricted to a specific subset of the X-Y plane. Standard\ntests for independence are not suitable in such cases, and alternative tests\nthat take the selection bias into account are required. To deal with this\nissue, we generalize the notion of quasi-independence with respect to the\nsampling mechanism, and study the problem of detecting any deviations from it.\nWe develop two test statistics motivated by the classic Hoeffding's statistic,\nand use two approaches to compute their distribution under the null: (i) a\nbootstrap-based approach, and (ii) a permutation-test with non-uniform\nprobability of permutations, sampled using either MCMC or importance sampling\nwith various proposal distributions.

We find that the\nJosephson current consists of three components which depend on three types of\nphase differences across the junction: the phase difference at the first band\n$\\delta\\varphi_1$, the phase difference at the second band $\\delta\\varphi_2$,\nand the difference at the center-of-mass phase $\\delta(\\varphi_1+\\varphi_2)/2$.\nA Cooper pairs generated by the band hybridization carries the last current\ncomponent. In some cases, the current-phase relationship deviates from the\nsinusoidal function as a result of time-reversal symmetry breaking down.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 07:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

To address these challenges, we\npropose the STEERAGE synthesis methodology. It consists of two complementary\napproaches: efficient architecture search, and grow-and-prune NN synthesis. The\nfirst step, covered in a global search module, uses an accuracy predictor to\nefficiently navigate the architectural search space. The predictor is built\nusing boosted decision tree regression, iterative sampling, and efficient\nevolutionary search. The second step involves local search. By using various\ngrow-and-prune methodologies for synthesizing convolutional and feed-forward\nNNs, it reduces the network redundancy, while boosting its performance. We have\nevaluated STEERAGE performance on various datasets, including MNIST and\nCIFAR-10.

In many vision applications the\nlocal spatial context of the features is important, but most common\nnormalization schemes including Group Normalization (GN), Instance\nNormalization (IN), and Layer Normalization (LN) normalize over the entire\nspatial dimension of a feature. This can wash out important signals and degrade\nperformance. For example, in applications that use satellite imagery, input\nimages can be arbitrarily large; consequently, it is nonsensical to normalize\nover the entire area. Positional Normalization (PN), on the other hand, only\nnormalizes over a single spatial position at a time. A natural compromise is to\nnormalize features by local context, while also taking into account group level\ninformation. In this paper, we propose Local Context Normalization (LCN): a\nnormalization layer where every feature is normalized based on a window around\nit and the filters in its group.

In this regard, a typical approach to evade\nbotnet identification and takedown mechanisms is the use of domain fluxing\nthrough the use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). These algorithms\nproduce an overwhelming amount of domain names that the infected device tries\nto communicate with to find the Command and Control server, yet only a small\nfragment of them is actually registered. Due to the high number of domain\nnames, the blacklisting approach is rendered useless. Therefore, the botmaster\nmay pivot the control dynamically and hinder botnet detection mechanisms. To\ncounter this problem, many security mechanisms result in solutions that try to\nidentify domains from a DGA based on the randomness of their name.\n  In this work, we explore hard to detect families of DGAs, as they are\nconstructed to bypass these mechanisms. More precisely, they are based on the\nuse of dictionaries so the domains seem to be user-generated. Therefore, the\ncorresponding generated domains pass many filters that look for, e.g. high\nentropy strings.

Its evolution is\nlinked to the dynamical structure of the host galaxy, to the supernova and AGN\nfeedback, and to (late-epoch) star formation, in a way that has yet to be fully\nunderstood. Important clues about the origin and evolution of the hot gas come\nfrom the abundances of heavy metals, that have been studied with increasing\ndetail with XMM-Newton and Chandra. We present recent high resolution\nhydrodynamical simulations of the hot gas evolution that include the above\nprocesses, and where several chemical species, originating in AGB stars and\nsupernovae of type Ia and II, have also been considered. The high resolution,\nof few parsecs in the central galactic region, allows us to track the metal\nenrichment, transportation and dilution throughout the galaxy. The comparison\nof model results with observed abundances reveals a good agreement for the\nregion enriched by the AGN wind, but also discrepancies for the diffuse hot\ngas; the latter indicate the need for a revision of standard assumptions,\nand/or the importance of neglected effects as those due to the dust, and/or\nresidual uncertainties in deriving abundances from the X-ray spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 10:04:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

In this talk, SVW summarised the results of recent papers on RQQs,\nincluding the use of far-infrared data to disentangle the radio emission from\nthe AGN and that from star formation. This provides evidence that black-hole\naccretion, instead, dominates the radio emission in RQQs.

The principle of these non-parametric\nmodels is to learn hyperplanes that separate data belonging to different\nclasses while maximizing their margins. However, SVMs constrain the learned\nhyperplanes to lie in the span of support vectors, fixed/taken from training\ndata, and this reduces their representational power and may lead to limited\ngeneralization performances. In this paper, we relax this constraint and allow\nthe support vectors to be learned (instead of being fixed/taken from training\ndata) in order to better fit a given classification task. Our approach,\nreferred to as deep total variation support vector machines, is parametric and\nrelies on a novel deep architecture that learns not only the SVM and the kernel\nparameters but also the support vectors, resulting into highly effective\nclassifiers. We also show (under a particular setting of the activation\nfunctions in this deep architecture) that a large class of kernels and their\ncombinations can be learned.

In this paper, we have\nsignificantly enhanced the performance of our recently published framework by\nusing manual alignments for initialization instead of the flat start technique.\nWe have also improved the NSR system performance by accounting for the possible\ntranscription mismatch between the acoustic and neural signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 10:37:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-13"}

Previous studies on\nlearning-to-rank either design uni-variate scoring functions that score each\ndocument separately, and thus failed to model the cross-document interactions;\nor construct multivariate scoring functions that score documents sequentially,\nwhich inevitably sacrifice the permutation invariance requirement.

Further, for a PNR\ncutting along any possible direction, by taking into account the z-direction in\nstructure, whether or not it owns edge states depends on the periodic\nzigzag-like morphology along the edges.

Doubly magic nuclei, with magic numbers for\nboth protons and neutrons, are spherical and extremely rare across the nuclear\nlandscape. While the sequence of magic numbers is well established for stable\nnuclei, evidence reveals modifications for nuclei with a large\nproton-to-neutron asymmetry. Here, we provide the first spectroscopic study of\nthe doubly magic nucleus $^{78}$Ni, fourteen neutrons beyond the last stable\nnickel isotope. We provide direct evidence for its doubly magic nature, which\nis also predicted by ab initio calculations based on chiral effective field\ntheory interactions and the quasi-particle random-phase approximation. However,\nour results also provide the first indication of the breakdown of the neutron\nmagic number 50 and proton magic number 28 beyond this stronghold, caused by a\ncompeting deformed structure. State-of-the-art phenomenological shell-model\ncalculations reproduce this shape coexistence, predicting further a rapid\ntransition from spherical to deformed ground states with $^{78}$Ni as turning\npoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 14:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-13"}

A possible\ncause of this phenomenon is a suppression of the heat flux across the magnetic\nfield lines in a crust and an envelope of magnetized neutron stars. In this\npaper we study three-dimensional effects, associated with non-axisymmetric\nmagnetic fields in neutron stars. We calculate the surface temperature\ndistribution by solving numerically a three dimensional heat transfer equation\nin a magnetized neutron star crust. We adopt an anisotropic (tensorial)\nelectron thermal conductivity coefficient, which is derived as an analytical\nsolution of the Boltzmann equation with a Chapman-Enskog method. To calculate\nthe surface temperature distribution, we construct a local one-dimensional\nplane-parallel model (\"Ts-Tb\"-relationship) of a magnetized neutron star\nenvelope. We then use it as an outer boundary condition for the\nthree-dimensional problem in the crust to find the self-consistent solution. To\nstudy possible observational manifestations from anisotropic temperature\ndistributions we calculate light curves with a composite black-body model. Our\ncalculations show, that a non-axisymmetric magnetic field distribution can lead\nto the irregular non-sinusoidal shape of a pulse profile as well as in some\ncases a significant amplification of pulsations of the thermal flux in\ncomparison to the pure-dipolar magnetic field configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 14:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-13"}

However, the low\ncorrelation between the classification score and localization accuracy of the\npredicted detections has severely hurt the localization accuracy of models. In\nthis paper, IoU-aware single-stage object detector is proposed to solve this\nproblem. Specifically, IoU-aware single-stage object detector predicts the IoU\nfor each detected box. Then the classification score and predicted IoU are\nmultiplied to compute the final detection confidence, which is more correlated\nwith the localization accuracy. The detection confidence is then used as the\ninput of the subsequent NMS and COCO AP computation, which will substantially\nimprove the localization accuracy of models. Sufficient experiments on COCO and\nPASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IoU-aware single-stage\nobject detector on improving model's localization accuracy.

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on the Sun are the largest explosions\nin the Solar System that can drive powerful plasma shocks. The eruptions,\nshocks, and other processes associated to CMEs are efficient particle\naccelerators and the accelerated electrons in particular can produce radio\nbursts through the plasma emission mechanism. Aims. Coronal mass ejections and\nassociated radio bursts have been well studied in cases where the CME\noriginates close to the solar limb or within the frontside disc. Here, we study\nthe radio emission associated with a CME eruption on the back side of the Sun\non 22 July 2012. Methods. Using radio imaging from the Nan\\c{c}ay\nRadioheliograph, spectroscopic data from the Nan\\c{c}ay Decametric Array, and\nextreme-ultraviolet observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and Solar\nTerrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft, we determine the nature of the\nobserved radio emission as well as the location and propagation of the CME.\nResults. We show that the observed low-intensity radio emission corresponds to\na type II radio burst or a short-duration type IV radio burst associated with a\nCME eruption due to breakout reconnection on the back side of the Sun, as\nsuggested by the pre-eruptive magnetic field configuration. The radio emission\nconsists of a large, extended structure, initially located ahead of the CME,\nthat corresponds to various electron acceleration locations. Conclusions. The\nobservations presented here are consistent with the breakout model of CME\neruptions. The extended radio emission coincides with the location of the\ncurrent sheet and quasi-separatrix boundary of the CME flux and the overlying\nhelmet streamer and also with that of a large shock expected to form ahead of\nthe CME in this configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 14:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

However, all the potential\nof these oscillation modes as a diagnosis of the stellar interior has not been\nfully exploited yet. In particular, the coupling factor or the gravity-offset\nof mixed modes, $q$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\rm g}$, are expected to provide\nadditional constraints on the mid-layers of red giants, which are located\nbetween the hydrogen-burning shell and the neighborhood of the base of the\nconvective zone.

Guided by\ntypical stellar models and general physical considerations, we modeled the\ncoupling region along with evolution. We subsequently obtained an analytical\nexpression of $q$ based on the asymptotic theory of mixed modes and compared it\nto observations. We show that the value of $q$ is degenerate with respect to\nthe thickness of the coupling evanescent region and the local density scale\nheight. A structural interpretation of the global variations in $q$ observed on\nthe subgiant and the red giant branches, as well as on the red clump, was\nobtained in the light of this model.

We argue that this is\nnecessary in order to achieve the factorizability of the path integral, the\nHilbert space and the phase space, and that it explains how edge modes acquire\na boundary dynamics and can contribute to observables such as the entanglement\nentropy. Our construction starts with a boundary action containing edge modes.\nIn the case of Maxwell theory for example this is equivalent to coupling the\ngauge field to boundary sources in order to be able to factorize the theory\nbetween subregions. We then introduce a new variational principle which\nproduces a systematic boundary contribution to the symplectic structure, and\nthereby provides a covariant realization of the extended phase space\nconstructions which have appeared previously in the literature. When\nconsidering the path integral for the extended bulk + boundary action,\nintegrating out the bulk degrees of freedom with chosen boundary conditions\nproduces a residual boundary dynamics for the edge modes, in agreement with\nrecent observations concerning the contribution of edge modes to the\nentanglement entropy. We put our proposal to the test with the familiar\nexamples of Chern-Simons and BF theory, and show that it leads to consistent\nresults. This therefore leads us to conjecture that this mechanism is\ngenerically true for any gauge theory, which can therefore all be expected to\nposses a boundary dynamics.

This\noccurs, for example, in the well-known (maximally) extended\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om or Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om-deSitter (RNdS) spacetimes. The\nboundary of the region determined by the initial data is called the \"Cauchy\nhorizon.\" It is located inside the black hole in these spacetimes. The strong\ncosmic censorship conjecture asserts that the Cauchy horizon does not, in fact,\nexist in practice because the slightest perturbation (of the metric itself or\nthe matter fields) will become singular there in a sufficiently catastrophic\nway that solutions cannot be extended beyond the Cauchy horizon. Thus, if\nstrong cosmic censorship holds, the Cauchy horizon will be converted into a\n\"final singularity,\" and determinism will hold.

However, most state-of-the-art algorithms are facing with\na fixed 3D object classification task set, which cannot well tackle the new\ncoming data with incremental tasks as human ourselves. Meanwhile, the\nperformance of most state-of-the-art lifelong learning models can be\ndeteriorated easily on previously learned classification tasks, due to the\nexisting of unordered, large-scale, and irregular 3D geometry data. To address\nthis challenge, in this paper, we propose a Lifelong 3D Object Classification\n(i.e., L3DOC) framewor, which can consecutively learn new 3D object\nclassification tasks via imitating 'human learning'. Specifically, the core\nidea of our proposed L3DOC model is to factorize PointNet in a perspective of\nlifelong learning, while capturing and storing the shared point-knowledge in a\nperspective of layer-wise tensor factorization architecture. To further\ntransfer the task-specific knowledge from previous tasks to the new coming\nclassification task, a memory attention mechanism is proposed to connect the\ncurrent task with relevant previously tasks, which can effectively prevent\ncatastrophic forgetting via soft-transferring previous knowledge. To our best\nknowledge, this is the first work about using lifelong learning to handle 3D\nobject classification task without model fine-tuning or retraining.\nFurthermore, our L3DOC model can also be extended to other backbone network\n(e.g., PointNet++). To the end, comparisons on several point cloud datasets\nvalidate that our L3DOC model can reduce averaged 1.68~3.36 times parameters\nfor the overall model, without sacrificing classification accuracy of each\ntask.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 06:41:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2020 14:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

Such\nmachines provide the basis for multifunctional, highly responsive, intelligent\n(artificial) active materials, which exhibit emergent behavior and the ability\nto perform tasks in response to external stimuli. A major challenge for\nunderstanding and designing active matter is their inherent nonequilibrium\nnature due to persistent energy consumption, which invalidates equilibrium\nconcepts such as free energy, detailed balance, and time-reversal symmetry.\nUnraveling, predicting, and controlling the behavior of active matter is a\ntruly interdisciplinary endeavor at the interface of biology, chemistry,\necology, engineering, mathematics, and physics. The vast complexity of\nphenomena and mechanisms involved in the self-organization and dynamics of\nmotile active matter comprises a major challenge. Hence, to advance, and\neventually reach a comprehensive understanding, this important research area\nrequires a concerted, synergetic approach of the various disciplines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 20:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

This current shoot-up in the PMO device is\nattributed to the thermal runaway in the device. Hence, the understanding of\nthe ambient temperature dependence on the current shoot-up of the PMO device is\nessential for the various applications that utilize the negative differential\nresistance (NDR). In this paper, we characterize the ambient thermal dependence\nof dc IV, accompanied by the development of analytical modeling. First, the\ntemperature-dependent current-voltage characteristic and shift in the threshold\nvoltage of the PMO device are shown experimentally. Second, a Joule heating\nbased thermal feedback model coupled with current transport by space charge\nlimited current (SCLC) is developed to explain the experimentally observed NDR\nregion. Finally, the model successfully predicts device behavior over a range\nof experimental ambient temperatures. As an alternative to TCAD, such a compact\nand accurate dc model sets up a platform to enable understanding, design with\ndevice and systems-level simulations of memory and neuromorphic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 05:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

The continuous TPCL drying during bubble movement also enables\nwell-defined contact line deposition of NP clusters along the moving path.
