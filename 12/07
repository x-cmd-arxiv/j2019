However, this assumption is not always true because some test\nfailures are due to so-called flaky tests, i.e., tests with non-deterministic\noutcomes. Unfortunately, flaky tests have major implications for testing and\ntest-dependent activities such as mutation testing and automated program\nrepair. To deal with this issue, we introduce a test flakiness assessment and\nexperimentation platform, called FlakiMe, that supports the seeding of a\n(controllable) degree of flakiness into the behaviour of a given test suite.\nThereby, FlakiMe equips researchers with ways to investigate the impact of test\nflakiness on their techniques under laboratory-controlled conditions. We use\nFlakiME to report results and insights from case studies that assesses the\nimpact of flakiness on mutation testing and program repair. These results\nindicate that a 5% of flakiness failures is enough to affect the mutation\nscore, but the effect size is modest (2% - 4% ), while it completely\nannihilates the ability of program repair to patch 50% of the subject programs.\nWe also observe that flakiness has case-specific effects, which mainly disrupts\nthe repair of bugs that are covered by many tests. Moreover, we find that a\nminimal amount of user feedback is sufficient for alleviating the effects of\nflakiness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 16:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-09"}

At the same time, the\ndirected evolution of biological molecules (in vitro evolution) is reasonably\ninterpreted as an implementation of GA in biochemical experiments. One of the\ntheoretical foundations of GA, justifying the effectiveness of evolutionary\nsearch, is the concept of building blocks (BB). In EC, it is reasonable to\nmatch these BBs to domains and motifs of macromolecules in evolutionary and\nsynthetic biology. Computer scientists have shown and carefully studied the\nimportance of preserving already found BBs for the effectiveness of\nevolutionary search. For this purpose, dozens of algorithms have been\ndeveloped, including heuristic crossover algorithms.

There are, however,\nsituations when that decay pattern may not exist, such as when a chargino is\nthe lightest electroweakino and the lightest supersymmetric particle is the\ngravitino. In regions of the parameter space where this ordering occurs, the\nproduction of any combination of neutralino/chargino leads to a $W^+W^- + X$\nplus missing energy final state, where $X$ could be additional jets or leptons.\nIf $X$ is soft, then all neutralino/chargino production modes fall into the\nsame experimental final state, dileptons plus missing energy.

Oftentimes, it relies on collections of visual signatures based\non descriptors, such as SIFT or SURF. However, these traditional descriptors\nwere designed for a certain domain of surface appearances and geometries\n(limited relief). Consequently, highly-textured surfaces such as tree bark pose\na challenge to them. In turn, this makes it more difficult to use trees as\nidentifiable landmarks for navigational purposes (robotics) or to track felled\nlumber along a supply chain (logistics). We thus propose to use data-driven\ndescriptors trained on bark images for tree surface re-identification. To this\neffect, we collected a large dataset containing 2,400 bark images with strong\nillumination changes, annotated by surface and with the ability to pixel-align\nthem. We used this dataset to sample from more than 2 million 64x64 pixel\npatches to train our novel local descriptors DeepBark and SqueezeBark. Our\nDeepBark method has shown a clear advantage against the hand-crafted\ndescriptors SIFT and SURF. For instance, we demonstrated that DeepBark can\nreach a mAP of 87.2% when retrieving 11 relevant bark images, i.e.\ncorresponding to the same physical surface, to a bark query against 7,900\nimages. Our work thus suggests that re-identifying tree surfaces in a\nchallenging illuminations context is possible.

Dense\nsuspensions of the emulsified WLM droplets exhibit thermally responsive\nproperties in which the viscoelastic moduli decrease by an order of magnitude\nover a temperature range of 0 $^\\circ$C to 25 $^\\circ$C. Surprisingly, the\nfragility (i.e. the volume-fraction dependence of the modulus) of the emulsions\ndoes not change with temperature. Instead, the emulsion modulus scales as a\npower-law with volume fraction with a constant exponent across all temperatures\neven as the droplet properties change from elastic to viscous. Nevertheless,\nthe underlying droplet dynamics depend strongly on temperature. From stress\nrelaxation experiments, we quantify droplet dynamics across the cage breaking\ntime scale below which the droplets are locally caged by neighbors and above\nwhich the droplets escape their cages to fully relax. For elastic droplets and\nhigh volume fractions, droplets relax less stress through cage rattling and the\nterminal relaxations are slower than for viscous droplets and lower volume\nfractions. The cage rattling and cage breaking dynamics are highly correlated\nfor variations in both temperature and emulsion concentration, suggesting that\nthermal and volume fraction effects represent independent parameters to control\nemulsion properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 17:10:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}

While much\neffort has been spent on quantifying the PFM amplitude signal, little attention\nhas been given to the PFM phase and it is often arbitrarily adjusted to fit\nexpectations or processed as recorded. This is problematic when investigating\nmaterials with unknown or potentially negative sign of the probed effective\nelectrostrictive coefficient or strong frequency dispersion of\nelectromechanical responses since assumptions about the phase cannot be\nreliably made.

The authors characterize the dynamics associated\nwith streamflow time series data from about seventy-one U.S. Geological Survey\n(USGS) stream-gauge stations in the state of Iowa. They employ a novel approach\ncalled visibility graph (VG). It uses the concept of mapping time series into\ncomplex networks to investigate the time evolutionary behavior of dynamical\nsystem. The authors focus on a simple variant of VG algorithm called horizontal\nvisibility graph (HVG). The tracking of dynamics and hence, the predictability\nof streamflow processes, are carried out by extracting two key pieces of\ninformation called characteristic exponent, {\\lambda} of degree distribution\nand global clustering coefficient, GC pertaining to HVG derived network. The\nauthors use these two measures to identify whether streamflow process has its\norigin in random or chaotic processes. They show that the characterization of\nstreamflow dynamics is sensitive to data attributes. Through a systematic and\ncomprehensive analysis, the authors illustrate that streamflow dynamics\ncharacterization is sensitive to the normalization, and the time-scale of\nstreamflow time-series. At daily scale, streamflow at all stations used in the\nanalysis, reveals randomness with strong spatial scale (basin size) dependence.\nThis has implications for predictability of streamflow and floods. The authors\ndemonstrate that dynamics transition through potentially chaotic to randomly\ncorrelated process as the averaging time-scale increases. Finally, the temporal\ntrends of {\\lambda} and GC are statistically significant at about 40% of the\ntotal number of stations analyzed. Attributing this trend to factors such as\nchanging climate or land use requires further research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 21:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

We find that\neven for smooth landscapes that exhibit a single maximum, the evolutionary\nalgorithms do not perform much better than the blind search due to the\nstochastic effects of the genetic roulette. The imitative learning is immune to\nthis effect thanks to the deterministic choice of the fittest string in the\npopulation, which is used as a model for imitation. The tradeoff is that for\nrugged landscapes the imitative learning search is more prone to be trapped in\nlocal maxima than the evolutionary algorithms.

A concrete example is the online interval discrepancy problem where T\npoints are sampled uniformly in [0,1], and the goal is to immediately color\nthem $\\pm$ such that every sub-interval remains nearly balanced. As random\ncoloring incurs $\\Omega(T^{1/2})$ discrepancy, while the offline bounds are\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{n \\log (T/n)})$ for vector balancing and $1$ for interval\nbalancing, a natural question is whether one can (nearly) match the offline\nbounds in the online setting for these problems.

Synchronization in this optomechanical system is very\nrobust with respect to thermal noise: in fact, even though each oscillator\nphase progressively diffuses over the whole limit cycle, their phase difference\nis locked, and such a phase correlation remains strong in the presence of\nthermal noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 21:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-06"}

For this algorithm, we prove $\\tilde O (\\varepsilon^{-1 / (p\n+ 1)})$ complexity in terms of the primal objective residual and the residual\nin the constraints. In the experiments, we illustrate the practical performance\nof the proposed algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 23:04:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 16:33:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 21:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

However, these are often treated as separate or even\ncompeting models. Here, we consider the possibility that AGN clouds are\ncondensations formed within the thermally unstable zones of outflows and then\ncompare the typical sizes of such condensations with the injection scale\n$k_0^{-1} \\sim L_0$ of turbulence, where $L_0$ is assumed to be the scale\nheight of a representative global outflow model. We find that for broad line\nregion (BLR) parameters, clouds are many orders of magnitude smaller than $L_0$\nand this has the following implication: BLR cloud dynamics can be modeled using\na local approximation through the use of multiphase turbulence simulations of\nX-ray irradiated plasmas. We present the first such 3D local clumpy turbulent\noutflow simulations. We show that the condensations share the same type of\nselection effects characterizing the locally optimally emitting cloud (LOC)\nscenario, thereby offering a physical interpretation for the LOC model and\naccounting for its almost uncanny successes. The ubiquitous presence of\nemission line regions in AGNs can be simply explained as the natural outcome of\nthere being a multiphase interval of $k$-space within the inertial range of a\nturbulent cascade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 23:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

But automatic tubular structure segmentation\nin CT scans is a challenging problem, due to issues such as poor contrast,\nnoise and complicated background. A tubular structure usually has a\ncylinder-like shape which can be well represented by its skeleton and\ncross-sectional radii (scales). Inspired by this, we propose a geometry-aware\ntubular structure segmentation method, Deep Distance Transform (DDT), which\ncombines intuitions from the classical distance transform for skeletonization\nand modern deep segmentation networks. DDT first learns a multi-task network to\npredict a segmentation mask for a tubular structure and a distance map. Each\nvalue in the map represents the distance from each tubular structure voxel to\nthe tubular structure surface. Then the segmentation mask is refined by\nleveraging the shape prior reconstructed from the distance map. We apply our\nDDT on six medical image datasets. The experiments show that (1) DDT can boost\ntubular structure segmentation performance significantly (e.g., over 13%\nimprovement measured by DSC for pancreatic duct segmentation), and (2) DDT\nadditionally provides a geometrical measurement for a tubular structure, which\nis important for clinical diagnosis (e.g., the cross-sectional scale of a\npancreatic duct can be an indicator for pancreatic cancer).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 23:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

One of them, repulsive edges have been inserted in the\nnanotrack and, in the other, an attractive strip has been placed exactly on the\nlongest axis of the nanotrack. Attractive and repulsive interactions can be\ngenerated from the engineering of magnetic properties. For instance, it is\nknown that the skyrmion can be attracted to a region where the exchange\nstiffness constant is decreased. On the other hand, the skyrmion can be\nrepelled from a region characterized by a local increase in the exchange\nstiffness constant.

Since in many applications radar and\ncommunication share the same platform, spectrum sharing can be facilitated by\njoint design as dual function radar-communications system. In this paper, we\npropose a joint transmit beamforming model for a dual-function\nmultiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar and multiuser MIMO communication\ntransmitter sharing the spectrum and an antenna array. The proposed\ndual-function system transmits the weighted sum of independent radar waveform\nand communication symbols, forming multiple beams towards the radar targets and\nthe communication receivers, respectively. The design of the weighting\ncoefficients is formulated as an optimization problem whose objective is the\nperformance of the MIMO radar transmit beamforming, while guaranteeing that the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at each communication user is\nhigher than a given threshold. Despite the non-convexity of the proposed\noptimization problem, it can be relaxed into a convex one, which can be solved\nin polynomial time, and we prove that the relaxation is tight. Then, we propose\na reduced complexity design based on zero-forcing the inter-user interference\nand radar interference. Unlike previous works, which focused on the\ntransmission of communication symbols to synthesize a radar transmit beam\npattern, our method provides more degrees of freedom for MIMO radar and is thus\nable to obtain improved radar performance, as demonstrated in our simulation\nstudy. Furthermore, the proposed dual-function scheme approaches the radar\nperformance of the radar-only scheme, i.e., without spectrum sharing, under\nreasonable communication quality constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2019 02:51:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2020 04:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

One way to\ninterpret this observation is as an association of the energetic particles with\ntrapping or channeling within magnetic flux tubes, possibly near their\nboundaries. However, it remains unclear whether this association is a transport\nor local effect; i.e., the particles might have been energized at a distant\nlocation, perhaps by shocks or reconnection, or they might experience local\nenergization or re-acceleration. The Parker Solar Probe (PSP), even in its\nfirst two orbits, offers a unique opportunity to study this statistical\ncorrelation closer to the corona. As a first step, we analyze the separate\ncorrelation properties of the energetic particles measured by the \\isois\ninstruments during the first solar encounter. The distribution of time\nintervals between a specific type of event, i.e., the waiting time, can\nindicate the nature of the underlying process.

The result\nof our work is a new \"Simple CNAPS\" architecture which has up to 9.2% fewer\ntrainable parameters than CNAPS and performs up to 6.1% better than state of\nthe art on the standard few-shot image classification benchmark dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2019 04:04:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 21:37:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 16:59:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-12"}

In this paper,\nthis specific problem is termed as potential passenger flow (PPF) prediction,\nwhich is a novel and important study connected with urban computing and\nintelligent transportation systems. For example, an accurate PPF predictor can\nprovide invaluable knowledge to designers, such as the advice of station scales\nand influences on other areas, etc. To address this problem, we propose a\nmulti-view localized correlation learning method.

This belief is largely based on an early result showing that\nthe join of two uniform samples is not an independent sample of the original\njoin, and that it leads to quadratically fewer output tuples. However,\nunfortunately, this result has little applicability to the key questions\npractitioners face. For example, the success metric is often the final\napproximation's accuracy, rather than output cardinality. Moreover, there are\nmany non-uniform sampling strategies that one can employ. Is sampling for joins\nstill futile in all of these settings? If not, what is the best sampling\nstrategy in each case?

We show that maximizing output size is easy, while there is an\ninformation-theoretical lower bound on the lowest variance achievable by any\nsampling strategy. We then define a hybrid sampling scheme that captures all\ncombinations of stratified, universe, and Bernoulli sampling, and show that\nthis scheme with our optimal parameters achieves the theoretical lower bound\nwithin a constant factor.

This network uses residual blocks to extract features,\ndense connect to reduce model size, and adds attentions mechanism to\nrecalibrate. Experiments on RML2016.10a show that this network has a higher\nrecognition rate and lower model complexity.

Origami partitions the ML model into multiple partitions. The\nfirst partition receives the encrypted user input within an SGX enclave. The\nenclave decrypts the input and then applies cryptographic blinding to the input\ndata and the model parameters. Cryptographic blinding is a technique that adds\nnoise to obfuscate data. Origami sends the obfuscated data for computation to\nan untrusted GPU/CPU. The blinding and de-blinding factors are kept private by\nthe SGX enclave, thereby preventing any adversary from denoising the data, when\nthe computation is offloaded to a GPU/CPU. The computed output is returned to\nthe enclave, which decodes the computation on noisy data using the unblinding\nfactors privately stored within SGX. This process may be repeated for each DNN\nlayer, as has been done in prior work Slalom.\n  However, the overhead of blinding and unblinding the data is a limiting\nfactor to scalability. Origami relies on the empirical observation that the\nfeature maps after the first several layers can not be used, even by a powerful\nconditional GAN adversary to reconstruct input.

The actor model is a popular paradigm that can be used to\ndevelop distributed applications: actors encapsulate state and communicate with\neach other by sending events. Consistency is guaranteed if each event only\naccesses a single actor, thus eliminating potential data races and deadlocks.\nHowever it is nontrivial to provide consistency for concurrent events spanning\nacross multiple actors. This paper addresses this problem by introducing AEON:\na framework that provides the following properties: (i) Programmability:\nprogrammers only need to reason about sequential semantics when reasoning about\nconcurrency resulting from multi-actor events; (ii) Scalability: AEON runtime\nprotocol guarantees serializable and starvation-free execution of multi-actor\nevents, while maximizing parallel execution; (iii) Elasticity: AEON supports\nfine-grained elasticity enabling the programmer to transparently migrate\nindividual actors without violating the consistency or entailing significant\nperformance overheads. Our empirical results show that it is possible to\ncombine the best of all the above three worlds without compromising on the\napplication performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2019 13:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

To improve the spatial resolution beyond\nthe diffraction limit, a current trend is to use various subwavelength probes\nto convert the near-field to the far-field. These techniques, while offering\nsignificant gains in spatial resolution, inherently lack the ability to rapidly\nobtain THz images due to the necessity of slow pixel-by-pixel raster scan and\noften suffer from low light throughput. In parallel, in the visible spectral\nrange, several super-resolution imaging techniques were developed that enhance\nthe image resolution by recording and statistically correlating multiple images\nof an object backlit with light from stochastically blinking fluorophores.\nInspired by this methodology, we develop a Super-resolution Orthogonal\nDeterministic Imaging (SODI) technique and apply it in the THz range. Since\nthere are no natural THz fluorophores, we use optimally designed mask sets\nbrought in proximity with the object as artificial fluorophores. Because we\ndirectly control the form of the masks, rather than relying on statistical\naverages, we aim at employing the smallest possible number of frames. After\ndeveloping the theoretical basis of SODI, we demonstrate the second-order\nresolution improvement experimentally using phase masks and binary amplitude\nmasks with only 8 frames. We then numerically show how to extend the SODI\ntechnique to higher orders to further improve the resolution. As our\nformulation is based on the equation of linear imaging and it uses spatial\nmodulation of either the phase or the amplitude of the THz wave, our\nmethodology can be readily adapted for the use with existing phase-sensitive\nsingle pixel imaging systems or any amplitude sensitive THz imaging arrays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2019 00:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

Thus, the Tournament Rank\nPrediction Score is more flexible than the commonly preferred log loss score\nfor such tasks. In addition, we show how predictions from historic tournaments\ncan be optimally combined into ensemble predictions in order to maximize the\nTRPS for a new tournament.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 21:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

However, this would require system-level\nunderstanding to modify and extend the existing terrestrial network\ninfrastructure. In this paper, we integrate UAVs both as user equipment and\nbase stations into existing LTE-Advanced heterogeneous network (HetNet) and\nprovide system-level insights of this three-tier LTE-Advanced air-ground HetNet\n(AG-HetNet). This AG-HetNet leverages cell range expansion (CRE), ICIC, 3D\nbeamforming, and enhanced support for UAVs. Using system-level understanding\nand through brute-force technique and heuristics algorithms, we evaluate the\nperformance of AG-HetNet in terms of fifth percentile spectral efficiency\n(5pSE) and coverage probability. We compare 5pSE and coverage probability, when\naerial base-stations (UABS) are deployed on a fixed hexagonal grid and when\ntheir locations are optimized using genetic algorithm (GA) and elitist harmony\nsearch algorithm based on genetic algorithm (eHSGA). Our simulation results\nshow the heuristic algorithms outperform the brute-force technique and achieve\nbetter peak values of coverage probability and 5pSE. Simulation results also\nshow that trade-off exists between peak values and computation time when using\nheuristic algorithms. Furthermore, the three-tier hierarchical structuring of\nFeICIC provides considerably better 5pSE and coverage probability than eICIC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2019 14:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}

It is generally accepted that CAIs formed close to the\nSun at temperatures above 1500 K, where presolar grains could not survive, and\nwere then transported to other regions of the nebula where the accretion of\nplanetesimals took place. In this context, a commonly held view is that\npresolar grains are found solely in the fine-grained rims surrounding\nchondrules and in the low-temperature fine-grained matrix that binds the\nvarious meteoritic components together. Here we demonstrate, based on noble gas\nisotopic signatures, that presolar SiC have been incorporated into fine-grained\nCAIs in the Allende carbonaceous chondrite at the time of their formation, and\nhave survived parent body processing. This finding provides new clues on the\nconditions in the nascent solar system at the condensation of first solids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 22:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}
