The present\npaper offers a data-based, probablistic perspective that enables the\nquantification of predictive uncertainties. One of the outstanding problems has\nbeen the introduction of physical constraints in the probabilistic machine\nlearning objectives. The primary utility of such constraints stems from the\nundisputed physical laws such as conservation of mass, energy etc. that they\nrepresent. Furthermore and apart from leading to physically realistic\npredictions, they can significantly reduce the requisite amount of training\ndata which for high-dimensional, multiscale systems are expensive to obtain\n(Small Data regime). We formulate the coarse-graining process by employing a\nprobabilistic state-space model and account for the aforementioned equality\nconstraints as virtual observables in the associated densities. We demonstrate\nhow probabilistic inference tools can be employed to identify the\ncoarse-grained variables in combination with deep neural nets and their\nevolution model without ever needing to define a fine-to-coarse (restriction)\nprojection and without needing time-derivatives of state variables.\nFurthermore, it is capable of reconstructing the evolution of the full,\nfine-scale system and therefore the observables of interest need not be\nselected a priori.

These elongations are\nreferred to as magnetic tongues and attributed to the presence of twist in the\nemerging magnetic flux-ropes (FRs) that form ARs. The presence of magnetic\ntongues affects the measurement of any AR characteristic that depends on its\nmagnetic flux distribution. The AR tilt-angle is one of them. We aim to develop\na method to isolate and remove the flux associated with the tongues to\ndetermine the AR tilt-angle with as much precision as possible. As a first\napproach, we used a simple emergence model of a FR. This allowed us to develop\nand test our aim based on a method to remove the effects of magnetic tongues.\nThen, using the experience gained from the analysis of the model, we applied\nour method to photospheric observations of bipolar ARs that show clear magnetic\ntongues. Using the developed procedure on the FR model, we can reduce the\ndeviation in the tilt estimation by more than 60%. Next we illustrate the\nperformance of the method with four examples of bipolar ARs selected for their\nlarge magnetic tongues. The new method efficiently removes the spurious\nrotation of the bipole. This correction is mostly independent of the method\ninput parameters and significant since it is larger than all the estimated tilt\nerrors. We have developed a method to isolate the magnetic flux associated with\nthe FR core during the emergence of bipolar ARs. This allows us to compute the\nAR tilt-angle and its evolution as precisely as possible. We suggest that the\nhigh dispersion observed in the determination of AR tilt-angles in studies that\nmassively compute them from line-of sight magnetograms can be partly due to the\nexistence of magnetic tongues whose presence is not sufficiently acknowledged.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 16:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

We\ngeneralize the traditional spin-boson model by considering a system-environment\ninteraction Hamiltonian that represents a partition of non-interacting\nsubsystems and highlights the collective correlation that appears exclusively\ndue to the coupling with a common environment. Remarkably, this simple, exactly\nsolvable model encompasses relevant aspects of a many-body open quantum system\nand features the subtle quantum effects that arise when the size scales up to a\nmacroscopic level. We derive an analytical expression for the time dependence\nof the density matrix without assuming coarse-graining. The resulting\ndecoherence function is eigen-selective and is a complex exponential whose\nexponent has a real part that introduces a decay similar to that in the\nspin-boson model. On the contrary, the imaginary part depends on the quantum\nnumbers and geometry of the whole partition and does not reflect the system\ntemperature. Motivated by decoherence in solid-state NMR we apply the\ntheoretical results to a partition of dipole-coupled spin pairs in contact with\na common phonon bath, using typical parameters of hydrated salts. The proposal\nallows estimating the decoherence time scale in terms of the system physical\nconstants. As a significant novelty, the decoherence function phase depends on\nthe eigenvalue distribution throughout the sample. It plays the leading role,\novershadowing the mechanism associated with the bath thermal state. Finally, we\napply the formalism to describe decoherence in the \"magic echo\" NMR reversal\nexperiment. We find that the system-environment correlation explains the origin\nof irreversibility, and both the decoherence rate value and its dependence on\nthe dipolar frequency, are remarkably similar to the experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 16:39:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 May 2020 20:21:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 18:15:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 02:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

Here, the update functions in the\ndiscrete-time model connecting year-to-year changes in the population densities\nare obtained by solving ordinary differential equations that mechanistically\ndescribe interactions when hosts become vulnerable to parasitoid attacks. We\nuse this semi-discrete formalism to study two key spatial effects: local\nmovement (migration) of parasitoids between patches during the vulnerable\nperiod; and yearly redistribution of populations across patches outside the\nvulnerable period. Our results show that in the absence of any redistribution,\nconstant density-independent migration and parasitoid attack rates are unable\nto stabilize an otherwise unstable host-parasitoid population dynamics.\nInterestingly, inclusion of host redistribution (but not parasitoid\nredistribution) before the start of the vulnerable period can lead to stable\ncoexistence of both species. Next, we consider a Type-III functional response\n(parasitoid attack rate increases with host density), where the absence of any\nspatial effects leads to a neutrally stable host-parasitoid equilibrium. As\nbefore, density-independent parasitoid migration by itself is again\ninsufficient to stabilize the population dynamics and host redistribution\nprovides a stabilizing influence. Finally, we show that a Type-III functional\nresponse combined with density-dependent parasitoid migration leads to stable\ncoexistence, even in the absence of population redistributions.

Each node can be either active or inactive,\nand two nodes connected by a bond cannot be active simultaneously. This\nsituation arises in wireless random-access networks where, due to destructive\ninterference, stations that are close to each other cannot use the same\nfrequency band.\n  We consider a model where the network is bipartite, the active nodes switch\nthemselves off at rate 1, and the inactive nodes switch themselves on at a rate\nthat depends on time and on which half of the bipartite network they are in. An\ninactive node cannot become active when one of the nodes it is connected to by\na bond is active. The switching protocol allows the nodes to share activity\namong each other. In the limit as the activation rate becomes large, we compute\nthe crossover time between the two states where one half of the network is\nactive and the other half is inactive. This allows us to assess the overall\nactivity of the network depending on the switching protocol.

Examples include\nvideo-based playlists on YouTube, image-based lists (or\"boards\") on Pinterest,\nbook-based lists on Goodreads, and answer-based lists on question-answer forums\nlike Zhihu. As users create these lists, a common challenge is in identifying\nwhat items to curate next. Some lists are organized around particular genres or\ntopics, while others are seemingly incoherent, reflecting individual\npreferences for what items belong together. Furthermore, this heterogeneity in\nitem consistency may vary from platform to platform, and from sub-community to\nsub-community. Hence, this paper proposes a generalizable approach for\nuser-generated item list continuation. Complementary to methods that exploit\nspecific content patterns (e.g., as in song-based playlists that rely on audio\nfeatures), the proposed approach models the consistency of item lists based on\nhuman curation patterns, and so can be deployed across a wide range of varying\nitem types (e.g., videos, images, books). A key contribution is in\nintelligently combining two preference models via a novel consistency-aware\ngating network - a general user preference model that captures a user's overall\ninterests, and a current preference priority model that captures a user's\ncurrent (as of the most recent item) interests. In this way, the proposed\nconsistency-aware recommender can dynamically adapt as user preferences evolve.\nEvaluation over four datasets(of songs, books, and answers) confirms these\nobservations and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model versus\nstate-of-the-art alternatives.

There is a human expert knowing the rewards and\nunsafe states based on his preference and objective, but querying that human\nexpert is expensive. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework for\nimitation learning (IL) algorithm that actively and interactively learns a\nmodel of the user's reward function with efficient queries. We build an\nadversarial generative model of states and a successor feature (SR) model\ntrained over transition experience collected by learning policy. Our method\nuses these models to select state-action pairs, asking the user to comment on\nthe optimality or safety, and trains a adversarial neural network to predict\nthe rewards. Different from previous papers, which are almost all based on\nuncertainty sampling, the key idea is to actively and efficiently select\nstate-action pairs from both on-policy and off-policy experience, by\ndiscriminating the queried (expert) and unqueried (generated) data and\nmaximizing the efficiency of value function learning. We call this method\nadversarial reward query with successor representation. We evaluate the\nproposed method with simulated human on a state-based 2D navigation task,\nrobotic control tasks and the image-based video games, which have\nhigh-dimensional observation and complex state dynamics. The results show that\nthe proposed method significantly outperforms uncertainty-based methods on\nlearning reward models, achieving better query efficiency, where the\nadversarial discriminator can make the agent learn human behavior more\nefficiently and the SR can select states which have stronger impact on value\nfunction. Moreover, the proposed method can also learn to avoid unsafe states\nwhen training the reward model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 18:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

Oxygen escape rates from Mars are high enough to account\nfor loss of a thick CO2 atmosphere, if CO2 was the main source of escaping O.\nBut here, using H isotope ratios, O escape calculations, and quantification of\nthe surface O sinks on Mars, we show for the first time that O escape from Mars\nafter 3.5 Ga must have been predominantly associated with the loss of H2O, not\nCO2, and therefore it is unlikely that >250 mbar Martian CO2 has been lost to\nspace in the last 3.5 Ga, because such results require highly unfavored O loss\nscenarios.

When addressing the control of these\nmodes, from a mathematical viewpoint one of the main challenges is that,\nbecause of the intrinsic nature of the models under consideration, the\nsolution, typically a proportion or a density function, needs to preserve given\nlower and upper bounds. Controlling the system to the desired final\nconfiguration then becomes complex, and sometimes even impossible. In the\npresent work, we analyze the controllability to constant steady-states of\nspatially homogeneous semilinear heat equations, with constraints in the state,\nand using boundary controls, which is indeed a natural way of acting on the\nsystem in the present context. The nonlinearities considered are among the most\nfrequent: monostable and bistable ones. We prove that controlling the system to\na constant steady-state may become impossible when the diffusivity is too small\n(or when the domain is large), due to the existence of barrier functions. When\nsuch an obstruction does not arise, we build sophisticated control strategies\ncombining the dissipativity of the system, the existence of traveling waves and\nsome connectivity of the set of steady-states. This connectivity allows\nbuilding paths that the controlled trajectories can follow, in a long time,\nwith small oscillations, preserving the natural constraints of the system. This\nkind of strategy was successfully implemented in one-space dimension, where\nphase plane analysis techniques allowed to decode the nature of the set of\nsteady-states. These techniques fail in the present multi-dimensional setting.\nWe employ a fictitious domain technique, extending the system to a larger ball,\nand building paths of radially symmetric solution that can then be restricted\nto the original domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 19:25:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 May 2020 08:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

Each client trains\na local model on its data and the local models are then aggregated by a central\nparty. Current federated learning methods struggle in cases with heterogeneous\nclient-side data distributions which can quickly lead to divergent local models\nand a collapse in performance. Careful hyper-parameter tuning is particularly\nimportant in these cases but traditional automated hyper-parameter tuning\nmethods would require several training trials which is often impractical in a\nfederated learning setting.

It\nis now well-understood that such recovery is possible by practical algorithms\nwhen the dictionary $A$ is incoherent or restricted isometric. In this paper,\nwe consider the more general case where $b$ lies in a subspace $\\mathcal{S}_0$\nspanned by a subset of linearly dependent columns of $A$, and the remaining\ncolumns are outside of the subspace. In this case, the sparsest representation\nmay not be unique, and the dictionary may not be incoherent or restricted\nisometric.

In contrast to\nmany algorithmic procedures, GP models are based on a statistical framework,\nwhich enables uncertainty quantification of the model structure and\npredictions. Both the evaluation of the likelihood and the prediction involve\nsolving linear systems. Hence, the computational costs are large and limit the\namount of data that can be handled. While there are many approximation\nstrategies that lower the computational cost of GP models, they often provide\nonly sub-optimal support for the parallel computing capabilities of current\n(high-performance) computing environments. We aim at bridging this gap with a\nparameter estimation and prediction method that is designed to be\nparallelizable.

A\ndiquark scalar, $S_{uu}$, that interacts perturbatively with two up quarks may\nbe as heavy as 10 TeV and would still produce tens of spectacular events at the\n14 TeV LHC. It is shown here that an ultraheavy $S_{uu}$ could be discovered\nthrough final states of very high energy in various channels, especially if the\ndiquark can decay into other new heavy particles. Examples include cascade\ndecays of $S_{uu}$ via a second scalar produced in pairs, which leads to two\ndijet resonances, or to more exotic signals with top quarks, Higgs bosons,\nelectroweak bosons, and high-$p_T$ jets. Another possibility is that the\ndiquark decays into a vectorlike quark of multi-TeV mass and a top or up quark.\nSignal events include one or two highly boosted top quarks and a Higgs boson or\na $Z$, without counterparts containing top antiquarks. Similarly, direct decays\nof the diquark into $tj$ or $tt$ with leptonic top decays involve only\npositively charged leptons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 03:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

More importantly, TA-MMA is proved to establish a\nquantitative connection between FCA and MMA, i.e., the first-order moment\ncomputed by TA-MMA is essentially the product of the phase contrast and the\ndark-field contrast retrieved by FCA, providing a new physical parameter for\nGPCI. The new physical parameter, in fact, can be treated as a ``hybrid-field''\ncontrast as it fuses the original phase contrast and dark-field contrast in a\nstraightforward manner, which may be the first physical fusion contrast in GPCI\nto our knowledge and may have a potential to be directly used in practical\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 06:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

We analyze the\nmagnetic field dependence of BMR tilts using the magnetograms of Michelson\nDoppler Imager (MDI) (1996-2011) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)\n(2010-2018).

Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)\nexperiments on this family have revealed that all terminations exhibit (nearly)\ngapless topological surface states (TSSs) within the AFM state, violating the\ndefinition of the AFM TI, as the surfaces being studied should be -breaking and\nopening a gap. Here we explain this curious paradox using a surface-bulk band\nhybridization picture. Combining ARPES and first-principles calculations, we\nprove that only an apparent gap is opened by hybridization between TSSs and\nbulk bands. The observed (nearly) gapless features are consistently reproduced\nby tight-binding simulations where TSSs are coupled to a Rashba-split bulk\nband. The Dirac-cone-like spectral features are actually of bulk origin, thus\nnot sensitive to the-breaking at the AFM surfaces. This picture explains the\n(nearly) gapless behaviour found in both Bi2Te3- and MnBi2Te4-terminated\nsurfaces and is applicable to all terminations of MnBi2nTe3n+1 family.

We demonstrate that a spin-triplet superconducting\nthin-film undergoes a phase transition from a helical state to a chiral state\nby increasing the applied magnetic field. This phase transition is accompanied\nby a drastic change in the property of surface Andreev bound states. As a\nconsequence, the helical-chiral phase transition, which is unique to the\nspin-triplet superconductors, can be detected through a sudden change in a\ntunneling conductance spectrum of a normal-metal/superconductor junction.\nImportantly, our proposal is constructed by combining fundamental and rigid\nconcepts regarding physics of spin-triplet superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 10:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

The\nautomated testing goals were achieved by jointly optimizing two objective\nfunctions: maximizing differential behaviors from models under testing and\nmaximizing neuron coverage. By observing differential behaviors from three\npre-trained models during each testing iteration, the input image that\ntriggered erroneous feedback was registered as a corner-case. The generated\ncorner-cases can be used to examine the robustness of DNNs and consequently\nimprove model accuracy. A project called DeepXplore was also used as a baseline\nmodel. After we fully implemented and optimized the baseline system, we\nexplored its application as an augmenting training dataset with newly generated\ncorner cases. With the GTRSB dataset, by retraining the model based on\nautomated generated corner cases, the accuracy of three generic models\nincreased by 259.2%, 53.6%, and 58.3%, respectively. Further, to extend the\ncapability of automated testing, we explored other approaches based on\ndifferential behavior criteria to generate photo-realistic images for deep\nlearning systems. One approach was to apply various transformations to the seed\nimages for the deep learning framework. The other approach was to utilize the\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GAN) technique, which was implemented on MNIST\nand Driving datasets. The style transferring capability has been observed very\neffective in adding additional visual effects, replacing image elements, and\nstyle-shifting (virtual image to real images).

Alternatively, risk\nanalyses on interbank networks have been done via centrality measures of the\nunderlying graph capturing the most interconnected and hence more prone to risk\nspreading banks.

This general class of problems encompasses, as important\nspecial cases, multistage stochastic convex optimization with non-Lipschitzian\nvalue functions and multistage stochastic mixed-integer linear optimization. We\ndevelop stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) type algorithms with nested\ndecomposition, deterministic sampling, and stochastic sampling. The key\ningredient is a new type of cuts based on generalized conjugacy. Several\ninteresting classes of MS-MINLP are identified, where the new algorithms are\nguaranteed to obtain the global optimum without the assumption of complete\nrecourse. This significantly generalizes the classic SDDP algorithms. We also\ncharacterize the iteration complexity of the proposed algorithms. In\nparticular, for a $(T+1)$-stage stochastic MINLP with $d$-dimensional state\nspaces, to obtain an $\\epsilon$-optimal root node solution, we prove that the\nnumber of iterations of the proposed deterministic sampling algorithm is upper\nbounded by $\\mathcal{O}((\\frac{2T}{\\epsilon})^d)$, and is lower bounded by\n$\\mathcal{O}((\\frac{T}{4\\epsilon})^d)$ for the general case or by\n$\\mathcal{O}((\\frac{T}{8\\epsilon})^{d/2-1})$ for the convex case. This shows\nthat the obtained complexity bounds are rather sharp. It also reveals that the\niteration complexity depends polynomially on the number of stages.

In this paper, we unravel a mechanism for enhancing the\npower spectrum during inflation that does not use the flattening of the\npotential or reduction of the sound speed of scalar perturbations.

A\nnumber of nodule segmentation techniques have been proposed, however, all of\nthe existing techniques rely on radiologist 3-D volume of interest (VOI) input\nor use the constant region of interest (ROI) and only investigate the presence\nof nodule voxels within the given VOI.

In this work, a novel semi-automated approach for 3-D\nsegmentation of nodule in volumetric computerized tomography (CT) lung scans\nhas been proposed. The proposed technique can be segregated into two stages, at\nthe first stage, it takes a 2-D ROI containing the nodule as input and it\nperforms patch-wise investigation along the axial axis with a novel adaptive\nROI strategy. The adaptive ROI algorithm enables the solution to dynamically\nselect the ROI for the surrounding slices to investigate the presence of nodule\nusing deep residual U-Net architecture.

The commonly occurred misalignment comes from the facts that the\nmapping from images to the model space is highly non-linear and the\nrotation-based pose representation of body models is prone to result in the\ndrift of joint positions. In this work, we investigate learning 3D human shape\nand pose from dense correspondences of body parts and propose a\nDecompose-and-aggregate Network (DaNet) to address these issues. DaNet adopts\nthe dense correspondence maps, which densely build a bridge between 2D pixels\nand 3D vertices, as intermediate representations to facilitate the learning of\n2D-to-3D mapping. The prediction modules of DaNet are decomposed into one\nglobal stream and multiple local streams to enable global and fine-grained\nperceptions for the shape and pose predictions, respectively. Messages from\nlocal streams are further aggregated to enhance the robust prediction of the\nrotation-based poses, where a position-aided rotation feature refinement\nstrategy is proposed to exploit spatial relationships between body joints.\nMoreover, a Part-based Dropout (PartDrop) strategy is introduced to drop out\ndense information from intermediate representations during training,\nencouraging the network to focus on more complementary body parts as well as\nneighboring position features. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated\non both indoor and real-world datasets including Human3.6M, UP3D, COCO, and\n3DPW, showing that our method could significantly improve the reconstruction\nperformance in comparison with previous state-of-the-art methods.

Previous work by (Gerlach et al., 2018) investigated\nthe resulting topics, or word clusters, while ours focuses on the study of the\ndocument clusters, which we call domains. To enable the synthetic description\nand interactive navigation of domains, we introduce measures and interfaces\nrelating both types of clusters, which reflect the structure of the graph and\nthe model. We then present a procedure that, starting from the document\nclusters, extends the block model to also cluster arbitrary metadata attributes\nof the documents. We call this procedure a domain-chained model, and our\nprevious measures and interfaces can be directly transposed to read the\nmetadata clusters. We provide an example application to a corpus that is\nrelevant to current STS research, and an interesting case for our approach: the\n1995-2017 collection of abstracts presented at ASCO, the main annual oncology\nresearch conference. Through a sequence of domain-topic and domain-chained\nmodels, we identify and describe a particular group of domains in ASCO that\nhave notably grown through the last decades, and which we relate to the\nestablishment of \"oncopolicy\" as a major concern in oncology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 15:17:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 04:48:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 12:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

We provide a\ngeneral framework for proving that polyfold invariants are natural, in the\nsense that under a mild hypothesis (the existence of an ``intermediary\nsubbundle'' of a strong polyfold bundle) the polyfold invariants for such\ndifferent models will be equal. As an application, we show that the polyfold\nGromov-Witten invariants are independent of all choices made in the\nconstruction of the Gromov-Witten polyfolds. Furthermore, we show that the\npolyfold Gromov-Witten invariants are independent of the choice of exponential\ndecay at the marked points.\n  In addition, we consider the following problem.

Identity of the homogeneous equation with an inhomogeneous\nstatement which is at the same time available is affirmed in general terms with\nthe aid of the Fourier transformation, and is then still further reinforced by\napplication of both formalisms to the particular example of a spherical\npotential barrier/well. Identical, closed-form outcomes are gotten in each case\nfor wave function eigenmode expansion coefficients on both scatterer interior\nand exterior. Admittedly, the solution procedure is far simpler in the\ninhomogeneous setting, wherein it exhibits the aspect of a direct, leapfrog\nadvance, unburdened by any implicit algebraic entanglement. By contrast, the\nhomogeneous path, of considerably greater length, insists, at each mode index,\nupon an exterior/interior coefficient entanglement, an entanglement which,\nhappily, is no more severe than that of a non-singular two-by-two linear\nsystem. Each such two-by-two linear system reproduces of course the output\nalready gotten under the inhomogeneous route, and is indeed identical to the\ntwo-by-two system encountered during the routine procedure wherein continuity\nis demanded at the barrier/well interface of both $\\psi$ and its radial\nderivative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 23:32:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 09:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-08"}

Previous conversion schemes focused on the representation\nof the analog output of a rectified linear (ReLU) gate in the ANN by the firing\nrate of a spiking neuron. But this is not possible for other commonly used ANN\ngates, and it reduces the throughput even for ReLU gates. We introduce a new\nconversion method where a gate in the ANN, which can basically be of any type,\nis emulated by a small circuit of spiking neurons, with At Most One Spike\n(AMOS) per neuron. We show that this AMOS conversion improves the accuracy of\nSNNs for ImageNet from 74.60% to 80.97%, thereby bringing it within reach of\nthe best available ANN accuracy (85.0%). The Top5 accuracy of SNNs is raised to\n95.82%, getting even closer to the best Top5 performance of 97.2% for ANNs. In\naddition, AMOS conversion improves latency and throughput of spike-based image\nclassification by several orders of magnitude.

In Italy, in recent years, vaccination coverage for key\nimmunizations as MMR has been declining to worryingly low levels. In 2017, the\nItalian Gov't expanded the number of mandatory immunizations introducing\npenalties to unvaccinated children's families. During the 2018 general\nelections campaign, immunization policy entered the political debate with the\nGov't in charge blaming oppositions for fuelling vaccine scepticism. A new\nGov't established in 2018 temporarily relaxed penalties. Objectives and\nMethods. Using a sentiment analysis on tweets posted in Italian during 2018, we\naimed to: (i) characterize the temporal flow of vaccines communication on\nTwitter (ii) evaluate the polarity of vaccination opinions and usefulness of\nTwitter data to estimate vaccination parameters, and (iii) investigate whether\nthe contrasting announcements at the highest political level might have\noriginated disorientation amongst the Italian public. Results. Vaccine-relevant\ntweeters interactions peaked in response to main political events. Out of\nretained tweets, 70.0% resulted favourable to vaccination, 16.5% unfavourable,\nand 13.6% undecided, respectively. The smoothed time series of polarity\nproportions exhibit frequent large changes in the favourable proportion,\nenhanced by an up and down trend synchronized with the switch between gov't\nsuggesting evidence of disorientation among the public. Conclusion. The\nreported evidence of disorientation documents that critical immunization\ntopics, should never be used for political consensus. This is especially true\ngiven the increasing role of online social media as information source, which\nmight yield to social pressures eventually harmful for vaccine uptake, and is\nworsened by the lack of institutional presence on Twitter, calling for efforts\nto contrast misinformation and the ensuing spread of hesitancy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 11:03:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 12:29:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 16:30:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2020 20:57:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2021 22:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}
