We observe that the global temporal\nfeatures are less generalizable, due to the temporal domain shift that videos\nfrom other unseen domains may have an unexpected absence or misalignment of the\ntemporal relations. This finding has motivated us to solve video domain\ngeneralization by effectively learning the local-relation features of different\ntimescales that are more generalizable, and exploiting them along with the\nglobal-relation features to maintain the discriminability. This paper presents\nthe VideoDG framework with two technical contributions. The first is a new deep\narchitecture named the Adversarial Pyramid Network, which improves the\ngeneralizability of video features by capturing the local-relation,\nglobal-relation, and cross-relation features progressively. On the basis of\npyramid features, the second contribution is a new and robust approach of\nadversarial data augmentation that can bridge different video domains by\nimproving the diversity and quality of augmented data.

Most recent\ncovariance matrix estimators use either shrinkage transformations or asymptotic\nresults from Random Matrix Theory (RMT). Shrinkage techniques help in pulling\nextreme correlation values towards certain target values whereas tools from RMT\nhelp in removing noisy eigenvalues of SCM. Both of these techniques use\ndifferent approaches to achieve a similar goal which is to remove noisy\ncorrelations and add structure to SCM to overcome the bias-variance trade-off.\nIn this paper, we first critically evaluate the pros and cons of these two\ntechniques and then propose an improved estimator which exploits the advantages\nof both by taking an optimally weighted convex combination of covariance\nmatrices estimated by an improved shrinkage transformation and a RMT based\nfilter. It is a generalized estimator which can adapt to changing sampling\nnoise conditions in various datasets by performing hyperparameter optimization.\nWe show the effectiveness of this estimator on the problem of designing a\nfinancial portfolio with minimum risk. We have chosen this problem because the\ncomplex properties of stock market data provide extreme conditions to test the\nrobustness of a covariance estimator. Using data from four of the world's\nlargest stock exchanges, we show that our proposed estimator outperforms\nexisting estimators in minimizing the out-of-sample risk of the portfolio and\nhence predicts population statistics more precisely. Since covariance analysis\nis a crucial statistical tool, this estimator can be used in a wide range of\nmachine learning, signal processing and high dimensional pattern recognition\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2019 17:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

This problem can\nbe defined as a repeated game between a group of learners and an adversary. The\nlearners attempt to minimize a sequence of global loss functions and at the\nsame time satisfy a sequence of coupled constraint functions. The global loss\nand the coupled constraint functions are the sum of local convex loss and\nconstraint functions, respectively, which are adaptively generated by the\nadversary. The local loss and constraint functions are revealed in a bandit\nmanner, i.e., only the values of loss and constraint functions at sampled\npoints are revealed to the learners, and the revealed function values are held\nprivately by each learner. We consider two scenarios, one- and two-point bandit\nfeedback, and propose two corresponding distributed bandit online algorithms\nused by the learners. We show that sublinear expected regret and constraint\nviolation are achieved by these two algorithms, if the accumulated variation of\nthe comparator sequence also grows sublinearly.

Surprisingly, in the classic\nproblem of influence maximization in social networks, relatively little study\nhas been devoted to diversity and its integration into the objective function\nof an influence maximization method.\n  In this work, we propose the integration of a side-information-based notion\nof seed diversity into the objective function of a targeted influence\nmaximization problem. Starting from the assumption that side-information is\navailable at node level in the general form of categorical attribute values, we\ndesign a class of monotone submodular functions specifically conceived for\ndetermining the diversity within a set of categorical profiles associated with\nthe seeds to be discovered. This allows us to develop an efficient scalable\napproximate method, with a constant-factor guarantee of optimality. More\nprecisely, we formulate the attribute-based diversity-sensitive targeted\ninfluence maximization problem under the state-of-the-art reverse influence\nsampling framework, and we develop a method, dubbed ADITUM, that ensures a\n(1-1/e-\\epsilon)-approximate solution under the general triggering diffusion\nmodel. We experimentally evaluated ADITUM on five real-world networks,\nincluding comparison with methods that exploit numerical-attribute-based\ndiversity and topology-driven diversity in influence maximization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2019 17:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

However, in this paper we show\nthat the capacity of the architecture has not been fully explored due to the\ninadequate utilization of the supervision information. Such insufficient\nutilization is caused by the supervision signal degradation in back\npropagation. Thus inspired, we propose a dually supervised method, named dually\nsupervised FPN (DSFPN), to enhance the supervision signal when training the\nfeature pyramid network (FPN). In particular, DSFPN is constructed by attaching\nextra prediction (i.e., detection or segmentation) heads to the bottom-up\nsubnet of FPN. Hence, the features can be optimized by the additional heads\nbefore being forwarded to subsequent networks. Further, the auxiliary heads can\nserve as a regularization term to facilitate the model training. In addition,\nto strengthen the capability of the detection heads in DSFPN for handling two\ninhomogeneous tasks, i.e., classification and regression, the originally shared\nhidden feature space is separated by decoupling classification and regression\nsubnets. To demonstrate the generalizability, effectiveness, and efficiency of\nthe proposed method, DSFPN is integrated into four representative detectors\n(Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN, Cascade RCNN, and Cascade Mask RCNN) and assessed on\nthe MS COCO dataset.

Then multiple confidence intervals can be constructed to infer the\nset of parameters simultaneously. The constructed multiple confidence intervals\nare the realization of a multiple interval estimator (MIE), the main focus of\nthis study. In particular, a thresholding approach is introduced to improve the\nperformance of the MIE. The developed thresholds require additional\ninformation, so a prior distribution is assumed for this purpose. The MIE\nprocedure is then evaluated by two performance measures: a global coverage\nprobability and a global expected content, which are averages with respect to\nthe prior distribution. The procedure defined by the performance measures will\nbe called a Bayes MIE with thresholding (BMIE Thres). In this study, a\nnormal-normal model is utilized to build up the BMIE Thres for a set of\nlocation parameters. Then, the behaviors of BMIE Thres are investigated in\nterms of the performance measures, which approach those of the corresponding\nz-based MIE as the thresholding parameter, C, goes to infinity. In addition, an\noptimization procedure is introduced to achieve the best thresholding parameter\nC. For illustrations, in-season baseball batting average data and leukemia gene\nexpression data are used to demonstrate the procedure for the known and unknown\nstandard deviations situations, respectively. In the ensuing simulations, the\ntarget parameters are generated from different true generating distributions to\nconsider the misspecified prior situation. The simulation also involves Bayes\ncredible MIEs, and the effectiveness among the different MIEs are compared with\nrespect to the performance measures. In general, the thresholding procedure\nhelps to achieve a meaningful reduction in the global expected content while\nmaintaining a nominal level of the global coverage probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2019 20:36:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

Our experiments on a vast\ncollection of concert show that our model performs 25%-50% better than baseline\nmodels. ragamAI's applications are two-fold. 1) it will assist musicians to\ncustomize their performance with the necessary variety required to sustain the\ninterest of the audience for the entirety of the concert 2) it will generate\ncarefully curated lists of south Indian classical music so that the listener\ncan discover the wide range of melody that the musical system can offer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2019 21:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

However, a large discrepancy is observed in the literature\namong the $ab~initio$ calculated carrier mobility in 2D materials.

Machine learning (ML)\nexacerbates this problem because any model trained with said data may have\nmemorized it, putting users at risk of a successful privacy attack exposing\ntheir information. Yet, having models unlearn is notoriously difficult. We\nintroduce SISA training, a framework that expedites the unlearning process by\nstrategically limiting the influence of a data point in the training procedure.\nWhile our framework is applicable to any learning algorithm, it is designed to\nachieve the largest improvements for stateful algorithms like stochastic\ngradient descent for deep neural networks.

We may take this prior into\naccount to partition and order data accordingly, and further decrease overhead\nfrom unlearning. Our evaluation spans several datasets from different domains,\nwith corresponding motivations for unlearning. Under no distributional\nassumptions, for simple learning tasks, we observe that SISA training improves\ntime to unlearn points from the Purchase dataset by 4.63x, and 2.45x for the\nSVHN dataset, over retraining from scratch.

However, most\nmeta-learning algorithms implicitly require that the meta-training tasks be\nmutually-exclusive, such that no single model can solve all of the tasks at\nonce. For example, when creating tasks for few-shot image classification, prior\nwork uses a per-task random assignment of image classes to N-way classification\nlabels. If this is not done, the meta-learner can ignore the task training data\nand learn a single model that performs all of the meta-training tasks\nzero-shot, but does not adapt effectively to new image classes. This\nrequirement means that the user must take great care in designing the tasks,\nfor example by shuffling labels or removing task identifying information from\nthe inputs. In some domains, this makes meta-learning entirely inapplicable. In\nthis paper, we address this challenge by designing a meta-regularization\nobjective using information theory that places precedence on data-driven\nadaptation. This causes the meta-learner to decide what must be learned from\nthe task training data and what should be inferred from the task testing input.\nBy doing so, our algorithm can successfully use data from\nnon-mutually-exclusive tasks to efficiently adapt to novel tasks.

The results\nshow that wind-fed accretion magnetars can evolve to the long period X-ray\npulsars with a spin period much longer than 1000 s. The spin-down trend\nobserved in 4U 2206+54 like sources is expected when the young X-ray binary\nsystems are on the way to their equilibrium period. Detailed calculations\nshowed that its spin-down may be affected by accretion with outflows or\naccretion while spin-down. Due to the magnetic field decay in magnetars,\nwind-fed accretion magnetars will have a decreasing equilibrium period for a\nconstant mass accretion rate. For 2S 0114+65, the spin-up rate due to magnetic\nfield decay is one order of magnitude smaller than the observations. The\nspin-up rate of 2S 0114+65 may be attributed to the formation of a transient\ndisk during wind accretion.

However, unlike a full design file, a wireframe model lacks\ncritical information, such as detailed shape, texture, and materials, needed by\na conventional renderer to produce 2D renderings of the objects or scenes. In\nthis paper, we bridge the information gap by generating photo-realistic\nrendering of indoor scenes from wireframe models in an image translation\nframework. While existing image synthesis methods can generate visually\npleasing images for common objects such as faces and birds, these methods do\nnot explicitly model and preserve essential structural constraints in a\nwireframe model, such as junctions, parallel lines, and planar surfaces. To\nthis end, we propose a novel model based on a structure-appearance joint\nrepresentation learned from both images and wireframes. In our model,\nstructural constraints are explicitly enforced by learning a joint\nrepresentation in a shared encoder network that must support the generation of\nboth images and wireframes. Experiments on a wireframe-scene dataset show that\nour wireframe-to-image translation model significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and structural integrity of\ngenerated images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 04:17:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 04:57:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

He proposed\nto differentiate quantum and classical phenomena and entanglement not by their\nrespective nonlocality and locality, as is common, but by the discreteness of\nquantum phenomena vs. the continuity of classical phenomena, supplemented by\nBohr's complementarity in the case of quantum phenomena. As I argue here,\nhowever, the question may not be that of \"eliminating the issue of quantum\nnonlocality\" but instead of illuminating this issue, a task that can, I also\nargue, be pursued by relating quantum nonlocality to other key features of\nquantum phenomena. I suggest that the following features of quantum phenomena\nand quantum mechanics, distinguishing them from classical phenomena and\nclassical physics--(1) the irreducible role of measuring instruments in\ndefining quantum phenomena; (2) discreteness; (3) complementarity; (4)\nentanglement; (5) quantum nonlocality; and (6) the irreducibly probabilistic\nnature of quantum predictions--are all interconnected in defining quantum\nphenomena and distinguishing them from classical ones, so that it is difficult\nto give an unconditional priority to any one of them. To argue this case, I\nconsider quantum phenomena and quantum mechanics from a nonrealist or, in terms\nadopted here, \"reality-without-realism\" (RWR) perspective.

The way out of this situation is via deployment of\nautomated, integrated residential energy systems, that provide the user with a\nseamless, cost effective service leading to improvement of comfort and\nresidential experience. Models are of critical importance in this context, as\nintelligent operating systems depend on them strongly. However, most of the\ncurrently used models of thermal behavior of buildings have high complexity\nleading to problems and implementation. The complexity also obscures the\nutilization of well know physical properties of buildings such as the thermal\nmass. In view of this, we investigate data-driven, simple-to-implement\nresidential environmental models that can serve as the basis for energy saving\nalgorithms in both retrofits and new designs of residential buildings. Despite\nthe nonlinearity of the underlying dynamics, using Koopman operator theory\nframework in this study we show that a linear second order model embedding,\nthat captures the physics that occur inside a single or multi-zone space does\nwell when compared with data simulated using EnergyPlus. This class of models\nhas low complexity.

This observation is at the basis\nof the Statistical Mechanical version of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and\nit provides an interpretation of entropy in terms of probabilities. However, we\ncannot rely on the statistical-mechanical expressions for entropy in systems\nthat are far from equilibrium. In this paper, we compare various extensions of\nthe definition of entropy, which have been proposed for non-equilibrium\nsystems. It has recently been proposed that measures of information density may\nserve to quantify entropy in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. We\npropose a new \"bit-wise\" method to measure the information density for off\nlattice systems. This method does not rely on coarse-graining of the particle\ncoordinates.

Therefore, the ZSL problem becomes a traditional supervised\nclassification problem. However, most of the existing methods based on the\ngenerative model only focus on the quality of synthesized samples at the\ntraining stage, and ignore the importance of the zero-shot recognition stage.\nIn this paper, we consider both the above two points and propose a novel\napproach. Specially, we select the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) as our\ngenerative model. In order to improve the quality of synthesized samples,\nconsidering the internal relation of the semantic description in the semantic\nspace as well as the fact that the seen and unseen visual information belong to\ndifferent domains, we propose a bi-semantic reconstructing (BSR) component\nwhich contain two different semantic reconstructing regressors to lead the\ntraining of GAN. Since the semantic descriptions are available during the\ntraining stage, to further improve the ability of classifier, we combine the\nvisual samples and semantic descriptions to train a classifier. At the\nrecognition stage, we naturally utilize the BSR component to transfer the\nvisual features and semantic descriptions, and concatenate them for\nclassification.

In this paper, we firstly analyze the characteristics of STCs\n(Syndrome-Trellis Codes), and then design the rule for post-processing to\nensure the correct extraction of hidden message.

To this end, we model the post-processing as a\nnon-linear integer programming, and implement it via heuristic search.

As an illustration of how this finding can be used\nto deal with certain distributed tracking problems, a solution is given to a\ndistributed set-point control problem for a continuous-time, multi-channel\nlinear system in which each and every agent with access to the system is able\nto independently adjust its scalar-valued, controlled output to any desired\nset-point value. To better understand the constraints on controller design, the\ndistributed control problem is recast as a classical decentralized control\nproblem. Armed with the tools of decentralized control, including the notion of\na \"fixed spectrum\", it is possible to show quite surprisingly that if the only\ninformation each agent is allowed to share with its neighbors is its measured\noutput, then distributed stabilization in some cases is impossible. Using\nwell-known decentralized control concepts, lower bounds are derived on the\ndimensions of the shared sub-states of local controllers which, if satisfied,\nguarantee that there will be no fixed closed-loop system eigenvalues to contend\nwith. The decentralized control perspective also enables one to assert that\nwithout imposing a partitioning constraint, the closed-loop spectrum of any\njointly controllable, jointly observable multi-channel linear system with a\nstrongly connected neighbor graph, can be freely assigned with distributed\nfeedback control.

Some models of core-collapse supernovae\npredict the formation of such low-mass black holes and a recent observation\nseems to confirm their existence. Here we show that the nature of the companion\nto the neutron star can be inferred from the properties of the kilonova\nemission once we know the chirp mass, which is the best constrained parameter\ninferred from the gravitational signal in low-latency searches. In particular,\nwe find that the kilonova in the black hole-neutron star case is far more\nluminous than in the neutron star-neutron star case, even when the black hole\nis non spinning. The difference in the kilonovae brightness arises primarily\nfrom the mass ejected during the merger. Indeed, in the considered interval of\nchirp masses, the mass ejection in double neutron star mergers is at its worst\nas the system promptly forms a black hole. Instead mass ejection for black\nhole-neutron star case is at its best as the neutron stars have low mass/large\ndeformability. The kilonovae from black hole-neutron star systems can differ by\ntwo to three magnitudes. The outcome is only marginally dependent on the\nequation of state. The difference is above the systematics in the modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 08:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

We solved the ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations for a wide range of parameters, including\nthe width and density of the prominence, and the magnetic field strength (B) of\nthe solar corona. We studied the periodicity and attenuation of the induced\noscillations. We found that longitudinal oscillations can be fit with the\npendulum model, whose restoring force is the field aligned component of\ngravity, but other mechanisms such as pressure gradients may contribute to the\nmovement. On the other hand, transverse oscillations are subject to magnetic\nforces. The analysis of the parametric survey shows, in agreement with\nobservational studies, that the oscillation period (P) increases with the\nprominence width. For transverse oscillations we obtained that P increases with\ndensity and decreases with B. For longitudinal oscillations we also found that\nP increases with density, but there are no variations with B. The attenuation\nof transverse oscillations was investigated by analysing the velocity\ndistribution and computing the Alfv\\'en continuum modes. We conclude that\nresonant absorption is the mean cause. Damping of longitudinal oscillations is\ndue to some kind of shear numerical viscosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 09:57:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

The\nplayers are coupled in both dynamics and cost through a linear regression\n(weighted average) as well as a quadratic regression (weighted covariance\nmatrix) of the states and actions, where the linear regression of states is\ncalled deep state. We study collaborative and non-collaborative games under\nthree information structures: perfect sharing, deep state sharing, and no\nsharing for three different types of weights: positive, homogeneous and\nasymptotically vanishing weights. For perfect and deep state sharing\ninformation structures, we propose a transformation-based technique to solve\nfor the best-response equations of players and identify a few sufficient\nconditions under which a unique subgame perfect Nash equilibrium exists. The\nequilibrium is linear in the local state and deep state, and the corresponding\ngains are obtained by solving a novel non-standard Riccati equation (whose\ndimension is independent of the number of players, thus making the solution\nscalable). When the information structure is no-sharing and the number of\nplayers is asymptotically large, one approximate population-size-dependent\nequilibrium and one approximate population-size-independent equilibrium (also\ncalled sequential weighted mean-field equilibrium) are proposed, and their\nconvergence to the infinite-population limits are established. In addition, the\nmain results are extended to infinite-horizon cost function, and generalized to\nmultiple orthogonal linear regressions and heterogeneous sub-populations. A\nnumerical example is provided to demonstrate the difference between the two\nproposed approximate equilibria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 09:57:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2019 19:14:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 08:57:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 16:27:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

The most prominent type of irregularities seen in them are\norbital period variations, a phenomenon which has been proposed to originate\nfrom changes in the gravitational quadrupole moment of the companion star. A\nphysically sound modelling of the timing of these systems is key to\nunderstanding their structure and evolution. In this paper we argue that a\ncomplete timing model must account for relativistic corrections as well as\nrotationally and tidally induced quadrupole distortions. We solve for the\nresulting orbital dynamics using perturbation theory and derive the\ncorresponding timing model in the low eccentricity limit. We find that the\nexpected strong quadrupole deformation of the companion star results in an\neffective minimum orbital eccentricity. It is accompanied by a fast periastron\nprecession which, if not taken into account, averages out any measurement of\nthe said eccentricity. We show that, with our model, detection of both\neccentricity and precession is likely to be made in many if not all spider\npulsar systems. Combined with optical light curves, this will allow us to\nmeasure the apsidal motion constant, connecting the quadrupole deformation to\nthe internal structure, and thus opening a new window into probing the nature\nof their exotic stellar interiors. Moreover, more accurate timing may\neventually lead spider pulsars to be used for high-precision timing experiments\nsuch as pulsar timing arrays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 09:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

Two notions of\nequivariant and partially equivariant systems are defined, and it is shown that\nsuch systems can be partitioned into a few sub-populations of decision makers,\nwhere every decision maker in each sub-population is coupled in both dynamics\nand cost function through a set of linear regressions of the states and actions\nof all decision makers. Two non-classical information structures are\nconsidered: deep-state sharing and partial deep-state sharing, where deep state\nrefers to the linear regression of the states of the decision makers in each\nsub-population. For a risk-sensitive cost function with deep-state sharing\nstructure, a closed-form low-complexity representation of the globally optimal\nstrategy is obtained, whose computational complexity is independent of the\nnumber of decision makers in each sub-population. In addition, it is shown that\nthe risk-sensitive solution converges to the risk-neutral one as the number of\ndecision makers increases to infinity. Moreover, two sub-optimal sequential\nstrategies under partial deep-state sharing information structure are proposed\nby introducing two Kalman-like filters, one based on the finite-population\nmodel and the other one based on the infinite-population model.

The above question can be formulated as a dynamic decision making problem\nwith imperfect information structure, where a decision maker wishes to find an\nefficient way to switch between data collection and data estimation while the\nquality of the estimation depends on the previously collected data (i.e.,\nduality effect).

In\nsuch systems, agents are partitioned into a few sub-populations so that the\ndynamics and cost of agents in each sub-population is invariant to the indexing\nof agents. The goal of agents is to minimize a common cost function in such a\nmanner that the agents in each sub-population are not discriminated or\nprivileged by the way they are indexed. Two non-classical information\nstructures are studied. In the first one, each agent observes its local state\nas well as the empirical distribution of the states of agents in each\nsub-population, called deep state, whereas in the second one, the deep states\nof a subset (possibly all) of sub-populations are not observed. Novel dynamic\nprograms are developed to identify globally optimal and sub-optimal solutions\nfor the first and second information structures, respectively. The\ncomputational complexity of finding the optimal solution in both space and time\nis polynomial (rather than exponential) with respect to the number of agents in\neach sub-population and is linear (rather than exponential) with respect to the\ncontrol horizon. This complexity is further reduced in time by introducing a\nforward equation, that we call deep Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, described by\nmultiple convolutional layers of Binomial probability distributions.

However, solving such a high-dimensional optimization problem often\nrequires a large amount of training samples in order to avoid overfitting.\nAdditionally, it is a typical non-convex problem affected by many local minima\nand flat regions. To address these problems, in this paper, we introduce naive\nGabor Networks or Gabor-Nets which, for the first time in the literature,\ndesign and learn CNN kernels strictly in the form of Gabor filters, aiming to\nreduce the number of involved parameters and constrain the solution space, and\nhence improve the performances of CNNs. Specifically, we develop an innovative\nphase-induced Gabor kernel, which is trickily designed to perform the Gabor\nfeature learning via a linear combination of local low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency components of data controlled by the kernel phase. With the\nphase-induced Gabor kernel, the proposed Gabor-Nets gains the ability to\nautomatically adapt to the local harmonic characteristics of the HSI data and\nthus yields more representative harmonic features. Also, this kernel can\nfulfill the traditional complex-valued Gabor filtering in a real-valued manner,\nhence making Gabor-Nets easily perform in a usual CNN thread. We evaluated our\nnewly developed Gabor-Nets on three well-known HSIs, suggesting that our\nproposed Gabor-Nets can significantly improve the performance of CNNs,\nparticularly with a small training set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 12:16:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 06:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}

In this paper, we aim to build more accurate and faster SISR\nmodels via developing better-performing feature extraction and fusion\ntechniques. Firstly, we proposed a novel Orientation-Aware feature extraction\nand fusion Module (OAM), which contains a mixture of 1D and 2D convolutional\nkernels (i.e., 5 x 1, 1 x 5, and 3 x 3) for extracting orientation-aware\nfeatures.

An important, puzzled issue on non-Hermitian\ntopological systems is the existence of defective edge states beyond usual\nbulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) that localize either on the left edge or the\nright edge of the one-dimensional system. In this paper, to understand the\nexistence of the defective edge states, the theory of anomalous bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence (A-BBC) is developed that distinguishes the non-Bloch\nbulk-boundary correspondence (NB-BBC) from non-Hermitian skin effect. By using\nthe one-dimensional non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model as an example, the\nunderlying physics of defective edge states is explored. The defective edge\nstates are physics consequence of boundary exceptional points of anomalous edge\nHamiltonian. In addition, with the help of a theorem, the number anomaly of the\nedge states in non-Hermitian topological systems become a mathematic problem\nunder quantitative calculations by identifying the Abelian/non-Abelian\nnon-Hermitian condition for edge Hamiltonian and verifying the deviation of the\nBBC ratio from 1. In the future, the theory for A-BBC can be generalized to\nhigher dimensional non-Hermitian topological systems (for example, 2D Chern\ninsulator).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 13:30:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

Although previous studies have proposed various methods to model\ndemonstrated movement primitives, one of the limitations of existing methods is\nthat the shape of the trajectories are encoded in high dimensional space. The\nhigh dimensionality of the trajectory representation can be a bottleneck in the\nsubsequent process such as planning a sequence of primitive motions. We address\nthis problem by learning the latent space of the robot trajectory. If the\nlatent variable of the trajectories can be learned, it can be used to tune the\ntrajectory in an intuitive manner even when the user is not an expert. We\npropose a framework for modeling demonstrated trajectories with a neural\nnetwork that learns the low-dimensional latent space. Our neural network\nstructure is built on the variational autoencoder (VAE) with discrete and\ncontinuous latent variables. We extend the structure of the existing VAE to\nobtain the decoder that is conditioned on the goal position of the trajectory\nfor generalization to different goal positions. Although the inference\nperformed by VAE is not accurate, the positioning error at the generalized goal\nposition can be reduced to less than 1~mm by incorporating the projection onto\nthe solution space. To cope with requirement of the massive training data, we\nuse a trajectory augmentation technique inspired by the data augmentation\ncommonly used in the computer vision community. In the proposed framework, the\nlatent variables that encodes the multiple types of trajectories are learned in\nan unsupervised manner, although existing methods usually require label\ninformation to model diverse behaviors.

We first demonstrate\nnumerically that for generic smooth structures, the conjecture holds in the\nlimiting sense when the apex radius of curvature of the primitive-base\n$R_a^{(1)}$, is much larger than the height of the crown $h_2$ (i.e.\n$h_2/R_a^{(1)} \\rightarrow 0$).

Multiple heterogeneous MAS networks can be integrated\ntogether as a multi-layer MAS network to offer holistic services.

In\nthis paper, we establish a games-in-games framework to capture the\nuncoordinated nature of decision makings under adversarial environment at\ndifferent layers. Specifically, each network operator controls the mobile\nagents in his own subnetwork and designs a secure strategy to maximize the\nglobal network connectivity by considering the behavior of jamming attackers\nthat aim to disconnect the network. The solution concept of meta-equilibrium is\nproposed to characterize the system-of-systems behavior of the autonomous\nagents. For online implementation of the control, we design a resilient\nalgorithm that improves the network algebraic connectivity iteratively.

Special focus will be on M-stationary points from\nBurdakov et al. (2016). We introduce nondegenerate M-stationary points and\ndefine their M-index. We show that all M-stationary points are generically\nnondegenerate. In particular, the sparsity constraint is active at all local\nminimizers of a generic SCNO. Some relations to other stationarity concepts,\nsuch as S-stationarity, basic feasibility, and CW-minimality, are discussed in\ndetail. By doing so, the issues of instability and degeneracy of points due to\ndifferent stationarity concepts are highlighted. The concept of M-stationarity\nallows to adequately describe the global structure of SCNO along the lines of\nMorse theory. For that, we study topological changes of lower level sets while\npassing an M-stationary point. As novelty for SCNO, multiple cells of dimension\nequal to the M-index are needed to be attached. This intriguing fact is in\nstrong contrast with other optimization problems considered before, where just\none cell suffices. As a consequence, we derive a Morse relation for SCNO, which\nrelates the numbers of local minimizers and M-stationary points of M-index\nequal to one. The appearance of such saddle points cannot be thus neglected\nfrom the perspective of global optimization. Due to the multiplicity phenomenon\nin cell-attachment, a saddle point may lead to more than two different local\nminimizers. We conclude that the relatively involved structure of saddle points\nis the source of well-known difficulty if solving SCNO to global optimality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 14:41:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2020 07:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

By the design,\nthe proposed network can learn the reconstruction process with as few as O(N)\nparameters, where N is the side length of an image to be reconstructed, which\nrepresents orders of magnitude improvements relative to the state-of-the-art\ndeep-learning-based reconstruction methods that map raw data to tomographic\nimages directly. Also, validated on a cone-beam breast CT dataset prepared by\nKoning Corporation on a commercial scanner, our method demonstrates a\ncompetitive performance over the state-of-the-art reconstruction networks in\nterms of image quality.

These tools do not give a good approach to large deviation problems for\nrandom graph models in the sparse regime. The aim of this paper is to study an\napproach for large deviation problems in this regime by establishing Large\nDeviation Principles (LDP) on suitable path spaces for certain exploration\nprocesses of the associated random graph sequence.\n  Our work focuses on the study of one particular class of random graph models,\nnamely the configuration model; however the general approach of using\nexploration processes for studying large deviation properties of sparse random\ngraph models has broader applicability. The goal is to study asymptotics of\nprobabilities of non-typical behavior in the large network limit. The first key\nstep for this is to establish a LDP for an exploration process associated with\nthe configuration model. A suitable exploration process here turns out to be an\ninfinite dimensional Markov process with transition probability rates that\ndiminish to zero in certain parts of the state space. Large deviation\nproperties of such Markovian models is challenging due to poor regularity\nbehavior of the associated local rate functions. Next, using the rate function\nin the LDP for the exploration process we formulate a calculus of variations\nproblem associated with the asymptotics of component degree distributions. The\nsecond key ingredient in our study is a careful analysis of the infinite\ndimensional Euler-Lagrange equations associated with this calculus of\nvariations problem. Exact solutions are identified which then provide explicit\nformulas for decay rates of probabilities of non-typical component degree\ndistributions and related quantities.\n  Please see the paper for the complete abstract.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 03:47:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 03:23:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

We argue that the main reason for this effect is the\ninertia of the chain, whereas the momentum received by the beads of the chain\nfrom the bottom of the container (typically called ``kicks'') plays no\nsignificant role. The inertia of the chain leads to an effect similar to\npulling the chain over a pulley placed up in the air, above the container. In\nthe model used before by the majority of researchers (the so-called\n``scientific consensus''), it was assumed that up to half of the mechanical\nwork done by the tension in the chain may be wasted when transformed into\nkinetic energy during the pickup process. This prevented the chain to rise\nunless the energy transfer in the pickup process is improved by ``kicks'' from\nthe bottom of the container. Here we show that the ``kicks'' are unnecessary\nand both, energy and momentum are conserved--as they should be, in the absence\nof dissipation--if one properly considers the tension and the movement of the\nchain. By doing so, we conclude that the velocity acquired by the chain is high\nenough to produce the fountain effect. Simple experiments validate our model\nand certain configurations produce the highest chain fountain, although\n``kicks'' are impossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2019 19:49:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 17:38:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 12:01:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 10:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}
