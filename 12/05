In\naddition, the complexity of the models used for optimization trigger further\nstudies on explaining and validating the results in real-world scenarios. The\ngoal of this chapter is to give an overview of the as-is and of the to-be usage\nof optimization in software engineering. The emphasis is on pragmatic use of\noptimization, and not so much on describing the most recent algorithmic\ninnovations and tool developments. The usage of optimization covers a wide\nrange of questions from different types of software engineering problems along\nthe whole life-cycle. To facilitate its more comprehensive and more effective\nusage, a checklist for a guided process is described. The chapter uses a\nrunning example Asymmetric Release Planning to illustrate the whole process. A\nReturn-on-Investment analysis is proposed as part of the problem scoping.

We collected large sets of\nmoments of minima from BRNO and observational data from AAVSO databases. Then,\nwe obtained moments of minima for AAVSO observations (totally - 397 minima)\nusing method of approximation with symmetric polynomial, realized in software\nMAVKA. This software was provided by Kateryna D. Andrych and Ivan L. Andronov.\nAfter we combined obtained moments of minima with data taken from BRNO and\nplotted O-C diagrams. For all stars these diagrams represented sinusoidal-like\noscillations with superposition of linear (for SU Boo, VV UMa, WW Gem, V0404\nLyr and HP Aur) or parabolic trend (for AR Lac, U CrB, S Equ and YY Eri). The\noscillations could be described as presence of the third component, which does\nnot take part in eclipses, but causes the well-known light-time effect (LTE).\nThat effect could be easily detected using long data series of observations.\nHowever, the oscillations have clear asymmetry, which we interpreted as\nelliptical shape of the third components orbit. Parabolic trend we explained as\nmass transfer between components of binary system. For all stars we computed\nminimal possible mass of the third component. In addition, we developed our own\ncode in computed language Python and using it we computed orbital elements of\nthe third component. Moreover, for stars with parabolic trend we calculated\nrate of the mass transfer. Finally, for all computed values we estimated\nerrors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 16:30:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-09"}

QVAE\nconsists of a classical auto-encoding structure realized by traditional deep\nneural networks to perform inference to, and generation from, a discrete latent\nspace. The latent generative process is formalized as thermal sampling from\neither a quantum or classical Boltzmann machine (QBM or BM).

Through comparison of a model planet's\ncalculated gravitational potential with the observed potential, inferences can\nbe made about interior quantities, including possible composition and the\nexistence of a core. Necessarily, a host of assumptions go into such\ncalculations, making every inference about a giant planet's structure strongly\nmodel dependent.

The result is a posterior distribution of\nthe interior structure that is not tied to assumed composition, thermal state,\nor material equations of state.

We then exploit the analytical framework to probe\nthe underlying mechanisms contributing to the local convective velocity at\ndifferent wall-normal locations by isolating the contributions of each\nspanwise-streamwise wavelength pair (flow scale).

The planet must have been\nscattered from a distance of at least a few au to its current location,\nrequiring the current or former presence of at least one more major planet in\nthe system in the absence of a hidden binary companion. We show that WD\nJ0914+1914 b could not have subsequently shrunk its orbit through chaotic\nf-mode tidal excitation (characteristic of such highly eccentric orbits) unless\nthe planet was or is highly inflated and possibly had partially thermally\nself-disrupted from mode-based energy release. We also demonstrate that if the\nplanet is currently assumed to reside on a near-circular orbit at 0.07 au, then\nnon-chaotic equilibrium tides impose unrealistic values for the planet's tidal\nquality factor. We conclude that WD~J0914+1914~b either (i) actually resides\ninterior to 0.07 au, (ii) resembles a disrupted \"Super-Puff\" whose remains\nreside on a circular orbit, or (iii) resembles a larger or denser ice giant on\na currently eccentric orbit. Distinguishing these three possibilities strongly\nmotivates follow-up observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 19:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 11:12:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

However, previous methods suffer from the incompleteness of\nthe knowledge graph, namely the interested link or entity that can be missing\nin the knowledge graph(explicit missing). Also, most previous models assume the\ndistance between the target and source entity is short, which is not true on a\nreal-world KG like Freebase(implicit missing). The sensitivity to the\nincompleteness of KG and the incapability to capture the long-distance link\nbetween entities have limited the performance of these models on large KG. In\nthis paper, we propose a model that leverages the text corpus to cure such\nlimitations, either the explicit or implicit missing links. We model the\nquestion answering on KG as a cooperative task between two agents, a knowledge\ngraph reasoning agent and an information extraction agent. Each agent learns\nits skill to complete its own task, hopping on KG or select knowledge from the\ncorpus, via maximizing the reward for correctly answering the question. The\nreasoning agent decides how to find an equivalent path for the given entity and\nrelation. The extraction agent provide shortcut for long-distance target entity\nor provide missing relations for explicit missing links with messages from the\nreasoning agent. Through such cooperative reward design, our model can augment\nthe incomplete KG strategically while not introduce much unnecessary noise that\ncould enlarge the search space and lower the performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 19:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-06"}

We assume (i) an idealised magnetostrophic spherical model of\nthe geodynamo neglecting inertia, viscosity and the solid inner core, and (ii)\na strongly stratified layer of constant depth immediately below the outer\nboundary within which there is no spherically radial flow. Due to the\nrestricted dynamics, Malkus showed that the geomagnetic field must obey a\ncertain condition which is a more restrictive version of the condition of\nTaylor (1963). The nonlinear nature of these constraints makes finding a\nmagnetic field that obeys them, here termed a Malkus state, a challenging task.\nNevertheless, such Malkus states when constrained further by geomagnetic\nobservations have the potential to probe the interior of the core. By focusing\non a particular class of magnetic fields for which the Malkus constraints are\nlinear, we describe a constructive method that turns any purely-poloidal field\ninto an exact Malkus state by adding a suitable toroidal field.

Without\nexplicitly calculating the constructed graph of inputs, two transductive\ngraph-based SSL approaches are presented with the computational complexity in\nlinear with the number of input data.

Using machine learning techniques for this task has\nproven to be quite useful. Typically, machine learning classifiers used for\nthis task require to have a fixed training set, and the training process is\nperformed offline. Upcoming surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope\n(LSST) will generate new observations daily, where an automatic classification\nsystem able to create alerts online will be mandatory. A system with those\ncharacteristics must be able to update itself incrementally. Unfortunately,\nafter training, most machine learning classifiers do not support the inclusion\nof new observations in light curves, they need to re-train from scratch.\nNaively re-training from scratch is not an option in streaming settings, mainly\nbecause of the expensive pre-processing routines required to obtain a vector\nrepresentation of light curves (features) each time we include new\nobservations. In this work, we propose a streaming probabilistic classification\nmodel; it uses a set of newly designed features that work incrementally. With\nthis model, we can have a machine learning classifier that updates itself in\nreal time with new observations. To test our approach, we simulate a streaming\nscenario with light curves from CoRot, OGLE and MACHO catalogs.

We study\nthis information disclosure problem in the context of two distinct two-sided\nmarket models: one in which the platform chooses prices and the sellers choose\nquantities (similar to ride-sharing), and one in which the sellers choose\nprices (similar to e-commerce). Our main results provide conditions under which\nsimple information structures commonly observed in practice, such as banning\ncertain sellers from the platform while not distinguishing between\nparticipating sellers, maximize the platform's revenue.

In this paper, we propose a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)\napproach that selects anchors and jointly optimizes the two modules of a\nCNN-based object detector. Our approach, referred to as Multiple Anchor\nLearning (MAL), constructs anchor bags and selects the most representative\nanchors from each bag. Such an iterative selection process is potentially\nNP-hard to optimize. To address this issue, we solve MAL by repetitively\ndepressing the confidence of selected anchors by perturbing their corresponding\nfeatures. In an adversarial selection-depression manner, MAL not only pursues\noptimal solutions but also fully leverages multiple anchors/features to learn a\ndetection model. Experiments show that MAL improves the baseline RetinaNet with\nsignificant margins on the commonly used MS-COCO object detection benchmark and\nachieves new state-of-the-art detection performance compared with recent\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 21:25:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-06"}

To fulfill the need, we aim at obtaining\nCNN models with both high testing accuracy and small size to address resource\nconstraints in many embedded devices. In particular, this paper focuses on\nproposing a generic reinforcement learning-based model compression approach in\na two-stage compression pipeline: pruning and quantization.

The speed of the CME, approximately 200-300 km s$^{-1}$ in the WISPR\nfield of view, is typical of slow, streamer blowout CMEs. This event was also\nobserved by the LASCO coronagraphs. WISPR and LASCO view remarkably similar\nstructures that enable useful cross-comparison between the two data sets as\nwell as stereoscopic imaging of the CME. Analysis is extended to lower heights\nby linking the white-light observations to EUV data from AIA, which reveal a\nstructure that erupts more than a full day earlier before the CME finally\ngathers enough velocity to propagate outward. This EUV feature appears as a\nbrightness enhancement in cooler temperatures such as 171 \\AA, but as a cavity\nin nominal coronal temperatures such as 193 \\AA. By comparing this circular,\ndark feature in 193 \\AA \\ to the dark, white-light cavity at the center of the\neruption in WISPR and LASCO, it can be seen that this is one coherent structure\nthat exists prior to the eruption in the low corona before entering the\nheliosphere and likely corresponds to the core of the magnetic flux rope.

Herein, we identify limitations in existing\nhit-or-miss neural definitions and we formulate an optimization problem to\nlearn the transform relative to deeper architectures. To this end, we model the\nsemantically important condition that the intersection of the hit and miss\nstructuring elements (SEs) should be empty and we present a way to express\nDon't Care (DNC), which is important for denoting regions of an SE that are not\nrelevant to detecting a target pattern.

We evaluate the net Doppler shifts of the spectra\ninduced by global winds and the planet's rotation and show that they are\nstrongly phase-dependent, especially for models with thicker and more extended\nclouds.

These atmospheres are irradiated by ultraviolet emission from the\nstar's moderately active chromosphere, and the consequence of this irradiation\nis unknown.

However, just like humans, real-world AI systems have to\ncoordinate and communicate with other agents in cooperative partially\nobservable environments as well. These settings commonly require participants\nto both interpret the actions of others and to act in a way that is informative\nwhen being interpreted. Those abilities are typically summarized as theory f\nmind and are seen as crucial for social interactions. In this paper we propose\ntwo different search techniques that can be applied to improve an arbitrary\nagreed-upon policy in a cooperative partially observable game. The first one,\nsingle-agent search, effectively converts the problem into a single agent\nsetting by making all but one of the agents play according to the agreed-upon\npolicy. In contrast, in multi-agent search all agents carry out the same\ncommon-knowledge search procedure whenever doing so is computationally\nfeasible, and fall back to playing according to the agreed-upon policy\notherwise. We prove that these search procedures are theoretically guaranteed\nto at least maintain the original performance of the agreed-upon policy (up to\na bounded approximation error). In the benchmark challenge problem of Hanabi,\nour search technique greatly improves the performance of every agent we tested\nand when applied to a policy trained using RL achieves a new state-of-the-art\nscore of 24.61 / 25 in the game, compared to a previous-best of 24.08 / 25.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 00:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-06"}

We present the average latitudinal\ndistribution of nitrogen and investigate the relationship between its\ndistribution and topography on Pluto by using maps that include the shifted\nbands of methane in solid solution with nitrogen to more completely map the\ndistribution of the nitrogen ice. We find that the global average bolometric\nalbedo is 0.83 +\\- 0.11, similar to that inferred for Triton, and that a\nsignificant fraction of Pluto's N2 is stored in Sputnik Planitia. Under the\nassumption that Pluto's nitrogen-dominated 11.5 microbar atmosphere is in vapor\npressure equilibrium with the nitrogen ice, the ice temperature is 36.93 +/-\n0.10 K, as measured by New Horizons. Combined with our global energy balance\ncalculation, this implies that the average bolometric emissivity of Pluto's\nnitrogen ice is probably in the range 0.47 - 0.72. This is consistent with the\nlow emissivities estimated for Triton based on Voyager, and may have\nimplications for Pluto's atmospheric seasonal variations, as discussed below.\nThe global pattern of volatile transport at the time of the encounter was from\nnorth to south, and the transition between condensation and sublimation within\nSputnik Planitia is correlated with changes in the grain size and CH4\nconcentration derived from the spectral maps.

We then apply the Block\nCoordinate Descent algorithm to efficiently solve the optimization problem.\nNumerical experiments illustrate the performance of the proposed method.\nSimulation results show that a station operator who leverages optimally priced\ncharging options could realize benefits in three ways: (i) net profits gains,\n(ii) overstay reduction, and (iii) increased quality-of-service.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 01:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-09"}

Finally, we give the representations of these groups.\nWith this description, the full description of the dynamics of general discrete\nsubgroups of PSL(n+1,C) will be almost complete.\n  In Chapter 3, we propose a new definition for the concept of limit set for\nthe action of a discrete subgroup of PSL(n+1,C), we call it the Frances limit\nset. In complex dimension n=2, the Kulkarni limit set seems to be the right\nnotion of limit set. However, in dimension n>2, the Kulkarni limit set is\ndifficult to compute and it is bigger than it needs to be. This new limit set\nis, in general, smaller than the Kulkarni limit set.

In real space, this anomaly can be quantified by the\ntemperature variance in the northern and southern Ecliptic hemispheres, with\nthe north displaying an anomalously low variance while the south appears\nconsistent with expectations from the best-fitting theory, LCDM. While this is\na well-established result in temperature, the low signal-to-noise ratio in\ncurrent polarization data prevents a similar comparison. Even though\ntemperature and polarization are correlated, polarization realizations\nconstrained by temperature data show that the lack of variance is not expected\nto be present in polarization data. Therefore, a natural way of testing whether\nthe temperature result is a fluke is to measure the variance of CMB\npolarization components. In anticipation of future CMB experiments that will\nallow for high-precision large-scale polarization measurements, we study how\nvariance of polarization depends on LCDM parameters' uncertainties by\nforecasting polarization maps with Planck's MCMC chains. We find that, unlike\ntemperature variance, polarization variance is noticeably sensitive to present\nuncertainties in cosmological parameters. This comes mainly from the current\npoor constraints on the reionization optical depth, tau, and the fact that tau\ndrives variance at low multipoles. In this work we show how the variance of\npolarization maps generically depends on the cosmological parameters. We\ndemonstrate how the improvement in the tau measurement seen between Planck's\ntwo latest data releases results in a tighter constraint on polarization\nvariance expectations. Finally, we consider even smaller uncertainties on tau\nand how more precise measurements of tau can drive the expectation for\npolarization variance in a hemisphere close to that of the\ncosmic-variance-limited distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 04:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

Although\nseveral photorealistic style transfer algorithms have been proposed, they need\nto rely on post- and/or pre-processing to make the generated images look\nphotorealistic. If we disable the additional processing, these algorithms would\nfail to produce plausible photorealistic stylization in terms of detail\npreservation and photorealism. In this work, we propose an effective solution\nto these issues. Our method consists of a construction step (C-step) to build a\nphotorealistic stylization network and a pruning step (P-step) for\nacceleration. In the C-step, we propose a dense auto-encoder named PhotoNet\nbased on a carefully designed pre-analysis. PhotoNet integrates a feature\naggregation module (BFA) and instance normalized skip links (INSL). To generate\nfaithful stylization, we introduce multiple style transfer modules in the\ndecoder and INSLs. PhotoNet significantly outperforms existing algorithms in\nterms of both efficiency and effectiveness. In the P-step, we adopt a neural\narchitecture search method to accelerate PhotoNet. We propose an automatic\nnetwork pruning framework in the manner of teacher-student learning for\nphotorealistic stylization. The network architecture named PhotoNAS resulted\nfrom the search achieves significant acceleration over PhotoNet while keeping\nthe stylization effects almost intact. We conduct extensive experiments on both\nimage and video transfer. The results show that our method can produce\nfavorable results while achieving 20-30 times acceleration in comparison with\nthe existing state-of-the-art approaches.

To address this shortcoming, we\npropose the concept of intelligent sensing by designing a programmable\nmetasurface for data-driven learnable data acquisition, and integrating it into\na data-driven learnable data processing pipeline.

A three-port deep artificial neural network (ANN) is\ndesigned to characterize the measurement process, such that an optimal\nmeasurement strategy is adaptive to the subject of interest by controlling the\nprogrammable metasurface for manipulating the EM illuminations.

Two latest trends in the area of\nthe energy-aware scheduling are considered, namely the variable energy pricing\nand the power-saving states of a machine. Scheduling of the jobs and the\nmachine states are considered jointly to achieve the highest possible savings.\nAlthough this problem has been previously addressed in the literature, the\nreported results of the state-of-the-art method show that the optimal solutions\ncan be found only for instances with up to 35 jobs and 209 intervals within 3\nhours of computation. We propose an elegant pre-processing technique called\nSPACES for computing the optimal switching of the machine states with respect\nto the energy costs. The optimal switchings are associated with the shortest\npaths in an interval-state graph that describes all possible transitions\nbetween the machine states in time. This idea allows us to implement efficient\ninteger linear programming and constraint programming models of the problem\nwhile preserving the optimality. The efficiency of the models lies in the\nsimplification of the optimal switching representation. The results of the\nexperiments show that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art\nexact method.

The question remains whether DFT can be\ncharacterised by a weaker version of UCT using a natural subclass of pointwise\ncontinuous functions without such a coding. We show that when \"pointwise\ncontinuous\" is replaced with \"having a continuous modulus\", UCT becomes\nequivalent to DFT. We also show that this weakening of UCT is equivalent to a\nsimilar principle for real-valued functions on the Cantor space\n$\\{0,1\\}^{\\mathbb{N}}$.

In the so-called polymer models, based on effective\ndeformations of the phase space of spherically symmetric general relativity in\nvacuum, one considers a deformed Hamiltonian constraint while keeping a\nnon-deformed vectorial constraint. In this article, we revisit and study\nfurther the question of covariance in these deformed gravity models. In\nparticular, we propose a Lagrangian formulation for these deformed gravity\nmodels where polymer-like deformations are introduced at the level of the full\ntheory prior to the symmetry reduction and prior to the Legendre\ntransformation. This enables us to test whether the concept of deformed\ncovariance found in spherically symmetric vacuum gravity can be extended to the\nfull theory, and we show that, in the large class of models we are considering,\nthe deformed covariance can not be realized beyond spherical symmetry in the\nsense that the only deformed theory which leads to a closed constraints algebra\nis general relativity. Hence, we focus on the spherically symmetric sector,\nwhere there exist non-trivial deformed but closed constraints algebras. We\ninvestigate the possibility to deform the vectorial constraint as well and we\nprove that non-trivial deformations of the vectorial constraint with the\ncondition that the constraints algebra remains closed do not exist. Then, we\ncompute the most general deformed Hamiltonian constraint which admits a closed\nconstraints algebra and thus leads to a well-defined effective theory\nassociated with a notion of deformed covariance. Finally, we study homogeneous\nsolutions of these effective theories and, remarkably, we solve explicitly and\nin full generality the corresponding modified Einstein equations, even for the\neffective theories which do not satisfy the closeness condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 09:40:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 09:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

With the growth of millimetre to meter sizes being\nhindered by a number of barriers, the recent discovery that dust evolution is\nable to create `self-induced' dust traps shows promises. The condensation and\nsublimation of volatile species at certain locations, called snow lines, is\nalso thought to be an important part of planet formation scenarios. Given that\ndust sticking properties change across a snow line, this raises the question:\nhow do snow lines affect the self-induced dust trap formation mechanism? The\nquestion is particularly relevant with the multiple observations of the carbon\nmonoxide (CO) snow line in protoplanetary discs, since its effect on dust\ngrowth and dynamics is yet to be understood. In this paper, we present the\neffects of snow lines in general on the formation of self-induced dust traps in\na parameter study, then focus on the CO snow line. We find that for a range of\nparameters, a dust trap forms at the snow line where the dust accumulates and\nslowly grows, as found for the water snow line in previous work. We also find\nthat, depending on the grains sticking properties on either side of the CO snow\nline, it could either be a starting or braking point for dust growth and drift.\nThis could provide clues to understand the link between dust distributions and\nsnow lines in protoplanetary disc observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 09:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

In this paper, we propose a general post-processing technique to\nrecover such gaps in large-scale segmentation masks. We cast this problem as a\nblind inpainting task, where the regions of missing lines in the segmentation\nmasks are not known to the algorithm, which we solve with an adversarially\ntrained neural network.

A practical example of such a\ncylinder is a subwavelength metallic rod with helical dielectric-filled\ncorrugations. The investigation is performed with the aim to maximize\nscattering cross-section by tailoring the surface impedance of cylindrical\nscatterers. For the normally incident TEz and TMz waves the required surface\nimpedance of a subwavelength cylinder can be produced by longitudinal (axial)\nand transverse (circumferential) corrugations, respectively. It is shown that\nsuch corrugations induce superscattering at multiple frequencies, which can be\nwidely tuned with either or both the size and permittivity of dielectric-filled\ncorrugations. In the microwave band, this effect is demonstrated to be robust\nto material losses and is validated against the full-wave simulations and\nexperiment. For the TEz waves the enhanced scattering from the cylinder is\nfound to have a broad frequency bandwidth, provided that the relative\npermittivity of corrugations is low or equal unity. In the latter case, the\ncorrugated cylinder acts as an all-metal superscatterer. For such cylinders the\nnear-field measurements are implemented and provide the first experimental\nevidence of the superscattering phenomenon for all-metal objects. In addition\nto multifrequency superscattering, the dielectric-filled corrugations are shown\nto provide multifrequency cloaking of the cylinder under the incidence of the\nTMz waves. Simultaneous superscattering and cloaking at multiple frequencies\ndistinguishes corrugated cylinders from other known practicable scatterers for\npotential applications in antenna designing, sensing, and energy harvesting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 10:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

For the genus Salvelinus, it was\nsupposed to sequence the genome of Arctic char, one of the most variable\nspecies of vertebrate animals. Sequencing was carried out (Christensen et al.,\n2018) using the tissues of the female IW2-2015 obtained from the company\nengaged in industrial aquaculture of chars - Icy Waters Ltd. The company\nexploits two of its own broodstocks - NL and TR, originating from the chars\nfrom the Nauyuk Lake and the Tree River (Nunavut, Canada). Since the complete\nmitochondrial genome of the female IW2-2015 was absent in the published\nassembly ASM291031v2, we determined its type and complete sequence from the\nsequence read archives taken from Genbank. It was found that the female's\nmitogenome belongs to the BERING haplogroup, which is characteristic of\nNorthern Dolly Varden S. malma malma. Analysis of other unlinked diagnostic\nloci encoded by nuclear DNA (ITS1, RAG1, SFO-12, SFO-18, SMM-21) also revealed\ndistinctive characters of Northern Dolly Varden in female IW2-2015.

This is not due to differences in solid-state diffusion times which\nwere similarly distributed for 2D and non-2D materials.

The\nelectrode conductivity is always extremely anisotropic with the out-of-plane\nconductivity, which is most relevant to rate-performance, roughly 1000 smaller\nthan the in-plane conductivity. For all fillers the conductivity increases with\nfiller loading although the nanotube-filled electrodes show by far the most\nrapid increase.

For this model, the possibility of the spin-chirality decoupling,\n{\\it i.e.\\}, the CG order setting in at a higher temperature than that of the\nSG order was suggested earlier, but still remains controversial. We simulate\nthe model up to the maximum size (linear dimension) $L=48$ under both periodic\nand open boundary conditions (BC). In locating the CG and SG transition\ntemperatures $T_{{\\rm CG}}$ and $T_{{\\rm SG}}$ by the $L\\rightarrow \\infty$\nextrapolation, a variety of independent physical quantities under the both BC\nare computed and utilized to get larger number of degrees of freedom (NDF).\nThanks to the large NDF up to NDF=43, we succeed in obtaining stable and\naccurate estimates of the CG and SG transition temperatures, $T_{{\\rm\nCG}}=0.142\\pm 0.001$ and $T_{{\\rm SG}}=0.131^{+0.001}_{-0.006}$. No sign of the\nsize crossover is observed. For larger $L$, the CG correlation length\nprogressively outgrows the SG correlation length at low temperatures. These\nresults provide strong numerical support for the spin-chirality decoupling. The\ncritical exponents associated with the CG and SG transitions are evaluated by\nuse of the finite-size scaling with the scaling correction.

Our first-principle\ncalculations reveal the following findings: (1) Monolayer graphether possesses\nexcellent dynamical and thermal stabilities as demonstrated by its favourable\ncohesive energy, absence of the soft phonon modes, and high melting point. (2)\nIt has a direct wide-band-gap of 2.39 eV, indicating its potential applications\nin ultraviolet optoelectronic devices. Interestingly, the direct band gap\nfeature is rather robust against the external strains (-10% to 10%) and\nstacking configurations. (3) Due to the hyperconjugative effect, graphether has\nthe high intrinsic electron mobility. More importantly, its in-plane stiffness\n(459.8 N m-1) is even larger than that of graphene. (4) The Pt(100) surface\nexhibits high catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation of dimethyl ether. The\nelectrostatic repulsion serves as a driving force for the rotation and\ncoalescence of two dehydrogenated precursors, which is favourable for the\nbottom-up growth of graphether. (5) Replacement of the C-C bond with an\nisoelectronic B-N bond can generate a stable Pmn21-BNO monolayer. Compared with\nmonolayer hexagonal boron nitride, Pmn21-BNO has a moderate direct band gap\n(3.32 eV) and better mechanical property along the armchair direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 11:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-06"}

It therefore becomes of\nparamount importance to assess the effectiveness of Twitter's use of blacklists\nin protecting its users from such threats. We collected more than 182 million\npublic tweets containing URLs from Twitter's Stream API over a 2-month period\nand compared these URLs against 3 popular phishing, social engineering, and\nmalware blacklists, including Google Safe Browsing (GSB). We focus on the delay\nperiod between an attack URL first being tweeted to appearing on a blacklist,\nas this is the timeframe in which blacklists do not warn users, leaving them\nvulnerable. Experiments show that, whilst GSB is effective at blocking a number\nof social engineering and malicious URLs within 6 hours of being tweeted, a\nsignificant number of URLs go undetected for at least 20 days. For instance,\nduring one month, we discovered 4,930 tweets containing URLs leading to social\nengineering websites that had been tweeted to over 131 million Twitter users.\nWe also discovered 1,126 tweets containing 376 blacklisted Bitly URLs that had\na combined total of 991,012 clicks, posing serious security and privacy\nthreats.

For example, the anomalies in the\npacket payload can be expressed as a number of specific strings which may cause\nattacks. Although some approaches have achieved remarkable progress, they are\nwith limited applications since they are dependent on in-depth expert\nknowledge, e.g., signatures describing anomalies or communication protocol at\nthe application level. Moreover, they might fail to detect the payload\nanomalies that have long-term dependency relationships. To overcome these\nlimitations and adaptively detect anomalies from the packet payload, we propose\na deep learning based framework which consists of two steps. First, a novel\nfeature engineering method is proposed to obtain the block-based features via\nblock sequence extraction and block embedding. The block-based features could\nencapsulate both the high-dimension information and the underlying sequential\ninformation which facilitate the anomaly detection. Second, a neural network is\ndesigned to learn the representation of packet payload based on Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Furthermore, we cast the\nanomaly detection as a classification problem and stack a Multi-Layer\nPerception (MLP) on the above representation learning network to detect\nanomalies. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets indicate\nthat our model could achieve a higher detection rate, while keeping a lower\nfalse positive rate compared with five state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 13:03:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

PESrank\ncalculates the rank of a given password in an optimal descending order of\nlikelihood. PESrank estimates a given password's rank in fractions of a\nsecond---without actually enumerating the passwords---so it is practical for\nonline use. It also has a training time that is drastically shorter than\nprevious methods. Moreover, PESrank is efficiently tweakable to allow model\npersonalization in fractions of a second, without the need to retrain the\nmodel; and it is explainable: it is able to provide information on why the\npassword has its calculated rank, and gives the user insight on how to pick a\nbetter password.\n  Our idea is to cast the question of password rank estimation in a\nprobabilistic framework used in side-channel cryptanalysis. We view each\npassword as a point in a $d$-dimensional search space, and learn the\nprobability distribution of each dimension separately. The dimensions represent\nthe base word, plus a dimension for each possible transformation such as adding\na suffix or using a capitalization pattern.

The bilevel model is solved by a decomposition\nalgorithm that combines traditional Benders cuts with combinatorial cuts to\nensure the consistency of mode choices by the leader and follower problems.

The technique was further extended to 3D with Ultrafast\nDoppler Tomography (UFD-T). In this work, UFD-T was applied to the monitoring\nof tumor angiogenesis in vivo providing structural and functional information\nat different stages of development. UFD-T volume renderings showed that our\nmurine model's vasculature stems from pre-existing vessels and sprouts to\nperfuse the whole volume as the tumor grows until a critical size is reached.\nThen, as the network becomes insufficient, the tumor core is no longer\nirrigated because the vasculature is mainly concentrated in the periphery. In\naddition to spatial distribution and growth patterns, UFD-T allowed a\nquantitative analysis of vessel size and length, revealing that the\ndiameter-distribution of vessels remained relatively constant throughout tumor\ngrowth. The network is dominated by small vessels at all stages of tumor\ndevelopment with more than 74% of the vessels less than 200 $\\mu$m in diameter.\nThis study also showed that cumulative vessel length is more closely related to\ntumor radius than volume, indicating that the vascularization becomes\ninsufficient when a critical mass is reached. UFD-T was also compared with\ndynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (DCE-US) and shown to provide\ncomplementary information regarding the link between structure and perfusion.\nIn conclusion, UFD-T is capable of an in vivo quantitative assessment of the\ndevelopment of tumor vasculature (vessels with blood speed >1mm/s (sensitivity\nlimit) assessed with a resolution limit of 80 $\\mu$m) in 3D.

Owing\nto the fact that computation over ring emulates computation over the real-world\nsystem architectures, secure computation over ring has gained momentum of late.\n  Cast in the offline-online paradigm, our constructions present the most\nefficient online phase in concrete terms. In the semi-honest setting, our\nprotocol requires communication of $2$ ring elements per multiplication gate\nduring the {\\it online} phase, attaining a per-party cost of {\\em less than one\nelement}.

Among various methods, Equivalent\ncircuit model (ECM) -based recursive least squares (RLS) parameter\nidentification is well suited for such difficult BMS environments. However, one\nwell-known critical problem of RLS is that it is very likely to be numerically\nunstable unless the measured inputs make enough excitation of the battery\nmodels.

In CMRLS,\nexact condition numbers are monitored with simple computations using recursive\nrelations between RLS variables.

The\npresent paper explains an important difference in mathematical reasoning\nbetween these classes: a permutation test fundamentally requires that the set\nof permutations has a group structure, in the algebraic sense; the reasoning\nbehind a randomization test is not based on such a group structure and it is\npossible to use an experimental design that does not correspond to a group.

While molecular vibrations are often in the\nground state even at elevated temperatures, one still needs to get a handle on\ndecoherence channels associated with phonons before an efficient quantum\noptical network based on opto-vibrational interactions in solid-state molecular\nsystems could be realized. As a step towards a better understanding of\ndecoherence in phononic environments, we take here an open quantum system\napproach to the non-equilibrium dynamics of guest molecules embedded in a\ncrystal, identifying regimes of Markovian versus non-Markovian vibrational\nrelaxation. A stochastic treatment based on quantum Langevin equations predicts\ncollective vibron-vibron dynamics that resembles processes of sub- and\nsuperradiance for radiative transitions. This in turn leads to the possibility\nof decoupling intramolecular vibrations from the phononic bath, allowing for\nenhanced coherence times of collective vibrations.

In contrast to existing\nGP kernel selection algorithms that aim to select only one kernel with the\nhighest model evidence, our proposed VBKS algorithm considers the kernel as a\nrandom variable and learns its belief from data such that the uncertainty of\nthe kernel can be interpreted and exploited to avoid overconfident GP\npredictions. To achieve this, we represent the probabilistic kernel as an\nadditional variational variable in a variational inference (VI) framework for\nSGPR models where its posterior belief is learned together with that of the\nother variational variables (i.e., inducing variables and kernel\nhyperparameters). In particular, we transform the discrete kernel belief into a\ncontinuous parametric distribution via reparameterization in order to apply VI.\nThough it is computationally challenging to jointly optimize a large number of\nhyperparameters due to many kernels being evaluated simultaneously by our VBKS\nalgorithm, we show that the variational lower bound of the log-marginal\nlikelihood can be decomposed into an additive form such that each additive term\ndepends only on a disjoint subset of the variational variables and can thus be\noptimized independently. Stochastic optimization is then used to maximize the\nvariational lower bound by iteratively improving the variational approximation\nof the exact posterior belief via stochastic gradient ascent, which incurs\nconstant time per iteration and hence scales to big data.

In this case, we say the tropicalization is \"fully\nfaithful.\"\n  Additionally, given a map $X$ to a toric variety $Y$, which induces a fully\nfaithful tropicalization, we show that we can extend the map to $X \\to Y \\times\n(\\mathbf{P}^1)^n$ such that the new tropicalization is smooth and fully\nfaithful.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 15:30:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2022 18:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-07"}

Robust MDPs (RMDP) provide a promising framework to\nmitigate vulnerabilities by computing policies with worst-case guarantees in\nreinforcement learning. The solution quality of an RMDP depends on the\nambiguity set, which is a quantification of model uncertainties. In this paper,\nwe propose a new approach for optimizing the shape of the ambiguity sets for\nRMDPs. Our method departs from the conventional idea of constructing a\nnorm-bounded uniform and symmetric ambiguity set. We instead argue that the\nstructure of a near-optimal ambiguity set is problem specific. Our proposed\nmethod computes a weight parameter from the value functions, and these weights\nthen drive the shape of the ambiguity sets.

Most algorithms in the literature for\nsolving this problem are conditional, i.e., they make some simplifying\nassumptions, such as, all the roots are simple or there are no roots on the\nboundary of the input box, or the underlying machine model is Real RAM. Root\nclustering is a generalization of the root approximation problem that allows\nfor errors in the computation and makes no assumption on the multiplicity of\nthe roots. An unconditional algorithm for computing a root clustering of a\nholomorphic function was given by Yap, Sagraloff and Sharma in 2013. They\nproposed a subdivision based algorithm using effective predicates based on\nPellet's test while avoiding any comparison with zeros (using soft zero\ncomparisons instead). In this paper, we analyze the running time of their\nalgorithm. We use the continuous amortization framework to derive an upper\nbound on the size of the subdivision tree. We specialize this bound to the case\nof polynomials and some simple transcendental functions such as exponential and\ntrigonometric sine. We show that the algorithm takes exponential time even for\nthese simple functions, unlike the case of polynomials. We also derive a bound\non the bit-precision used by the algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first such result for holomorphic functions. We introduce new geometric\nparameters, such as the relative growth of the function on the input box, for\nanalyzing the algorithm. Thus, our estimates naturally generalize the known\nresults, i.e., for the case of polynomials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 08:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-09"}

His approach to this aspect of general relativity\ndiffered sharply from another set forth by Hilbert, even though the latter\nconjectured in 1916 that both theories were probably equivalent. Rather than\npursue this question himself, Hilbert chose to charge Emmy Noether with the\ntask of probing the mathematical foundations of these two theories. Indirect\nreferences to her results came out two years later when Klein began to examine\nthis question again with Noether's assistance. Over several months, Klein and\nEinstein pursued these matters in a lengthy correspondence, which culminated\nwith several publications, including Noether's now famous paper \"Invariante\nVariationsprobleme\". The present account focuses on the earlier discussions\nfrom 1916 involving Einstein, Hilbert, and Noether. In these years, a Swiss\nstudent named R.J. Humm was studying relativity in G\\\"ottingen, during which\ntime he transcribed part of Noether's lost manuscript on Hilbert's invariant\nenergy vector. By making use of this 9-page manuscript, it is possible to\nreconstruct the arguments Noether set forth in response to Hilbert's\nconjecture.

However, performance and power\nconstraints make it still challenging to deploy DNNs on mobile devices due to\ntheir high computational complexity. Binary neural networks (BNNs) have been\ndemonstrated as a promising solution to achieve this goal by using bit-wise\noperations to replace most arithmetic operations. Currently, existing\nGPU-accelerated implementations of BNNs are only tailored for desktop\nplatforms. Due to architecture differences, mere porting of such\nimplementations to mobile devices yields suboptimal performance or is\nimpossible in some cases. In this paper, we propose PhoneBit, a GPU-accelerated\nBNN inference engine for Android-based mobile devices that fully exploits the\ncomputing power of BNNs on mobile GPUs. PhoneBit provides a set of\noperator-level optimizations including locality-friendly data layout, bit\npacking with vectorization and layers integration for efficient binary\nconvolution. We also provide a detailed implementation and parallelization\noptimization for PhoneBit to optimally utilize the memory bandwidth and\ncomputing power of mobile GPUs. We evaluate PhoneBit with AlexNet, YOLOv2 Tiny\nand VGG16 with their binary version. Our experiment results show that PhoneBit\ncan achieve significant speedup and energy efficiency compared with\nstate-of-the-art frameworks for mobile devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 04:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

It is\nalso used over widely studied face recognition problem. However, the existing\nlayers of CNN are unable to cope with the problem of hard examples which\ngenerally produce lower class scores. Thus, the existing methods become biased\ntowards the easy examples. In this paper, we resolve this problem by\nincorporating a Parametric Sigmoid Norm (PSN) layer just before the final\nfully-connected layer. We propose a PSNet CNN model by using the PSN layer. The\nPSN layer facilitates high gradient flow for harder examples as compared to\neasy examples. Thus, it forces the network to learn the visual characteristics\nof hard examples. We conduct the face recognition experiments to test the\nperformance of PSN layer. The suitability of the PSN layer with different loss\nfunctions is also experimented. The widely used Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)\nand YouTube Faces (YTF) datasets are used in the experiments. The experimental\nresults confirm the relevance of the proposed PSN layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 05:10:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

Using this algorithm, the solution of some\noverdetermined PDE systems can be obtained in explicit form. The main\ndifficulty of this algorithm is the huge number of polynomial equations that\narise, which need to be investigated and solved numerically or explicitly. For\nexample, the overdetermined hydrodynamic equations obtained earlier by the\nauthors give a minimum of 10 million such equations. However, if they are\nsolved explicitly, then we can write out the solution of the hydrodynamic\nequations in a general form, which is of great scientific interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 12:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-30"}

Hence, the Casimir force was measured\nbetween an Au-coated microsphere and N-doped SiC samples with Si- and\nC-terminated faces, and the results were compared with the measurements using\nthe same microsphere and a metallic Ruthenium surface. Electrostatic\ncalibration showed that the Si- and C-faces behave differently with a nearly\n~0.6-0.7 V difference in the contact potentials V0Si/C. We attribute this to a\nhigher incorporation of N on the C-terminated face in the near surface region\nresulting in the formation of NOx and an increased work function compared to\nthe Si-terminated surface which is in agreement with x-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy data. Notably, the contact potential of the SiC-C face was closer\nto the metallic Ru-Au system. However, the measured optical properties of the\nSiC-Si/C terminated surfaces with ellipsometry did not show any substantial\ndifferences indicating that the effective depth of the Si/C terminating surface\nlayers are significantly smaller than the photon penetration depth not leading\nto any differences in the calculated forces via Lifshitz theory. Nonetheless,\nthe measured Casimir forces, after compensation of the electrostatics\ncontributions, showed differences between the Si/C faces, whereas the\ncomparison with the Lifshitz theory prediction shows better agreement for the\nSiC-Si face. Finally, comparison of the Casimir forces below 40 nm separations\nbetween the SiC-Si/C and Ru surfaces indicated that the short-range roughness\neffects on the Casimir force increase in magnitude with increasing metallic\nbehavior of the plate surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 20:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}
