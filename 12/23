This mechanism is inherently related to\nspontaneous parametric down-conversion that currently constitutes the building\nblock for entangled photon pair generation, which has been exploited in modern\nquantum technologies ranging from computing to communications and cryptography.\nHere we demonstrate single-pass optical parametric amplification at the\nultimate thickness limit; using semiconducting transition-metal\ndichalcogenides, we show that amplification can be attained over a propagation\nthrough a single atomic layer. Such a second-order nonlinear interaction at the\n2D limit bypasses phase-matching requirements and achieves ultrabroad\namplification bandwidths. The amplification process is independent on the\nin-plane polarization of the impinging signal and pump fields. First-principle\ncalculations confirm the observed polarization invariance and linear\nrelationship between idler and pump powers.

An immediate solution is to use an ON-OFF nonlinearity between the\ncontroller and the system. However, this solution is only available when\ncontrollers are implemented in computer systems. When this is not the case,\nlike in biology, alternative approaches need to be explored. Based on recent\nresearch in the control of biological systems, we propose to develop a theory\nfor the integral control of positive systems using nonnegative controls based\non the so-called \\emph{antithetic integral controller} and two \\emph{positively\nregularized integral controllers}, the so-called \\emph{exponential integral\ncontroller} and \\emph{logistic integral controller}. For all these controllers,\nwe establish several qualitative results, which we connect to standard results\non integral control. We also obtain additional results which are specific to\nthe type of controllers. For instance, we show an interesting result\nstipulating that if the gain of the antithetic integral controller is suitably\nchosen, then the local stability of the equilibrium point of the closed-loop\nsystem does not depend on the choice for the coupling parameter, an additional\nparameter specific to this controller. Conversely, we also show that if the\ncoupling parameter is suitably chosen, then the equilibrium point of the\nclosed-loop system is locally stable regardless the value of the gain. For the\nexponential integral controller, we can show that the local stability of the\nequilibrium point of the closed-loop system is independent of the gain of the\ncontroller and the gain of the system. The stability only depends on the\nexponential rate of the controller, again a parameter that is specific to this\ntype of controllers.

For a given graph $G$ and a set of $k$\npairs of terminals in $G$, it asks for the existence of $k$ vertex-disjoint\npaths connecting each pair of terminals. The proof of Robertson and Seymour\n[JCTB 1995] of the existence of an $n^3$ algorithm for any fixed $k$ is one of\nthe highlights of their Graph Minors project. In this paper, we focus on the\nversion of the problem where all the paths are required to be shortest paths.\nThis problem, called the disjoint shortest paths problem, was introduced by\nEilam-Tzoreff [DAM 1998] where she proved that the case $k = 2$ admits a\npolynomial time algorithm. This problem has received some attention lately,\nespecially since the proof of the existence of a polynomial time algorithm in\nthe directed case when $k = 2$ by B\\'erczi and Kobayashi [ESA 2017]. However,\nthe existence of a polynomial algorithm when $k = 3$ in the undirected version\nremained open since 1998. In this paper we show that for any fixed $k$, the\ndisjoint shortest paths problem admits a polynomial time algorithm. In fact for\nany fixed $C$, the algorithm can be extended to treat the case where each path\nconnecting the pair $(s,t)$ has length at most $d(s,t) + C$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 17:26:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 15:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-23"}

Deep learning methods have been\nshown to perform well, but for this purpose large numbers of manual annotations\nare needed in the first place, which necessitate prohibitive levels of\nresources that are often unavailable. In an active learning framework of\nselecting informed samples for manual labeling, expert clinician time for\nmanual annotation can be optimally utilized, enabling the establishment of\nlarge labeled datasets for machine learning. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmethod that combines representativeness with uncertainty in order to estimate\nideal samples to be annotated, iteratively from a given dataset. Our novel\nrepresentativeness metric is based on Bayesian sampling, by using\ninformation-maximizing autoencoders. We conduct experiments on a shoulder\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset for the segmentation of four\nmusculoskeletal tissue classes. Quantitative results show that the annotation\nof representative samples selected by our proposed querying method yields an\nimproved segmentation performance at each active learning iteration, compared\nto a baseline method that also employs uncertainty and representativeness\nmetrics. For instance, with only 10% of the dataset annotated, our method\nreaches within 5% of Dice score expected from the upper bound scenario of all\nthe dataset given as annotated (an impractical scenario due to resource\nconstraints), and this gap drops down to a mere 2% when less than a fifth of\nthe dataset samples are annotated. Such active learning approach to selecting\nsamples to annotate enables an optimal use of the expert clinician time, being\noften the bottleneck in realizing machine learning solutions in medicine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 17:49:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

First we give the\nbasic idea to use the parameters of broad lines to SMBH mass measurements.\nAfter that we give an overview of broad lines from X-ray (Fe k{\\alpha}) to the\nIR (Pashen and Brecket lines) which have been used for SMBH mass estimates.\nAdditionally, we describe and discuss a new method for SMBH mass measurements\nusing the polarization in the broad lines emitted from Type 1 AGNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 18:32:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 18:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-24"}

However, they have long acquisition times. Here, we propose\nsignificant speed ups using a deep learning single volume super resolution\nreconstruction, to recover high resolution features from rapidly acquired low\nresolution WH-bSSFP images. Methods: A 3D residual U-Net was trained using\nsynthetic data, created from a library of high-resolution WH-bSSFP images by\nsimulating 0.5 slice resolution and 0.5 phase resolution. The trained network\nwas validated with synthetic test data, as well as prospective low-resolution\ndata. Results: Synthetic low-resolution data had significantly better image\nquality after super-resolution reconstruction. Qualitative image scores showed\nsuper-resolved images had better edge sharpness, fewer residual artefacts and\nless image distortion than low-resolution images, with similar scores to\nhigh-resolution data. Quantitative image scores showed super-resolved images\nhad significantly better edge sharpness than low-resolution or high-resolution\nimages, with significantly better signal-to-noise ratio than high-resolution\ndata. Vessel diameters measurements showed over-estimation in the\nlow-resolution measurements, compared to the high-resolution data. No\nsignificant differences and no bias was found in the super-resolution\nmeasurements. Conclusion: This paper demonstrates the potential of using a\nresidual U-Net for super-resolution reconstruction of rapidly acquired\nlow-resolution whole heart bSSFP data within a clinical setting. The resulting\nnetwork can be applied very quickly, making these techniques particularly\nappealing within busy clinical workflow. Thus, we believe that this technique\nmay help speed up whole heart CMR in clinical practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 18:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

In essence, the method can be characterized as a\ndomain decomposition method which iterates between a local anharmonic and a\nglobal harmonic problem, where the latter is solved by means of the lattice\nGreen function of the ideal crystal. This local/global splitting gives rise to\ntremendously improved convergence rates over related alternating Schwarz\nmethods. In a previous publication (Hodapp et al., 2019, Comput. Methods in\nAppl. Mech. Eng. 348), we have shown that this method also applies to\nlarge-scale three-dimensional problems, possibly involving hundreds of\nthousands of atoms, using fast summation techniques exploiting the low-rank\nnature of the asymptotic lattice Green function.\n  Here, we generalize the Sinclair method to bounded domains and develop an\nimplementation using a discrete boundary element method to correct the infinite\nsolution with respect to a prescribed far-field condition, thus preserving the\nadvantage of the original method of not requiring a global spatial\ndiscretization. Moreover, we present a detailed convergence analysis and show\nfor a one-dimensional problem that the method is unconditionally stable under\nphysically motivated assumptions. To further improve the convergence behavior,\nwe develop an acceleration technique based on a relaxation of the transmission\nconditions between the two subproblems.

Traditionally, randomized\ncontrolled trials (A/B tests) are performed to evaluate treatment assignment\nfunctions. However, such trials can be time-consuming, expensive, and even\nunethical in some cases. Therefore, offline counterfactual evaluation of\ntreatment assignment functions becomes a pressing issue because a massive\namount of observational data is available in today's big data era.\nCounterfactual evaluation requires handling the hidden confounders -- the\nunmeasured features which causally influence both the treatment assignment and\nthe outcome. To deal with the hidden confounders, most of the existing methods\nrely on the assumption of no hidden confounders. However, this assumption can\nbe untenable in the context of massive observational data. When such data comes\nwith network information, the later can be potentially useful to correct hidden\nconfounding bias. As such, we first formulate a novel problem, counterfactual\nevaluation of treatment assignment functions with networked observational data.\nThen, we investigate the following research questions: How can we utilize\nnetwork information in counterfactual evaluation? Can network information\nimprove the estimates in counterfactual evaluation? Toward answering these\nquestions, first, we propose a novel framework, \\emph{Counterfactual Network\nEvaluator} (CONE), which (1) learns partial representations of latent\nconfounders under the supervision of observed treatments and outcomes; and (2)\ncombines them for counterfactual evaluation. Then through extensive\nexperiments, we corroborate the effectiveness of CONE. The results imply that\nincorporating network information mitigates hidden confounding bias in\ncounterfactual evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 21:13:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

To unify these views and observations, we\ngenerate glassy configurations of controlled gap magnitude $\\omega_c$ at\ntemperature ${T=0}$, using so-called `breathing' particles, and study how such\ngapped states respond to thermal fluctuations.

To this aim, we\nhave annotated relevant utterances in the conversations released by the TREC\nCaST 2019 track.

A comparative study of single-layer\n(SL) tungsten diselenide(WSe2) relative to bulk WSe2 shows substantial\ndifferences in the transient response as measured by time- and angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (TRARPES). The conduction-band minimum in bulk WSe2,\npopulated by optical pumping, decays promptly. The corresponding decay for SL\nWSe2 is much slower and exhibits two time constants. The results indicate the\npresence of two distinct decay channels in the SL that are correlated with the\nbreaking of space inversion symmetry in the two-dimensional limit. This\nsymmetry breaking lifts the spin degeneracy of the bands, which in turn causes\nthe blockage of decay for one spin channel.

Despite these gains, future\ndevelopment and practical deployment of deep networks is hindered by their\nblackbox nature, i.e., lack of interpretability, and by the need for very large\ntraining sets. An emerging technique called algorithm unrolling or unfolding\noffers promise in eliminating these issues by providing a concrete and\nsystematic connection between iterative algorithms that are used widely in\nsignal processing and deep neural networks. Unrolling methods were first\nproposed to develop fast neural network approximations for sparse coding. More\nrecently, this direction has attracted enormous attention and is rapidly\ngrowing both in theoretic investigations and practical applications. The\ngrowing popularity of unrolled deep networks is due in part to their potential\nin developing efficient, high-performance and yet interpretable network\narchitectures from reasonable size training sets. In this article, we review\nalgorithm unrolling for signal and image processing. We extensively cover\npopular techniques for algorithm unrolling in various domains of signal and\nimage processing including imaging, vision and recognition, and speech\nprocessing.

That is all local optima are\nalso global optima. This paper suggests that such functions are easily\nfortified by adding a localized bump at the location of one of the optima,\nmaking the functions more difficult to optimize due to the multiple competing\nlocal optima. This process is illustrated here for the Branin-Hoo function,\nwhich has three global optima. We use the popular Python SciPy differential\nevolution (DE) optimizer for the illustration. DE also allows the use of the\ngradient-based BFGS local optimizer for final convergence. By making a large\nnumber of replicate runs we establish the probability of reaching a global\noptimum with the original and fortified Branin-Hoo. With the original function\nwe find 100% probability of success with a moderate number of function\nevaluations. With the fortified version, the probability of getting trapped in\na non-global optimum could be made small only with a much larger number of\nfunction evaluations. However, since the probability of ending up at the global\noptimum is usually 1/3 or more, it may be beneficial to perform multiple\ninexpensive optimizations rather than one expensive optimization. Then the\nprobability of one of them hitting the global optimum can be made high. We\nfound that for the most challenging global optimum, multiple runs reduced\nsubstantially the extra cost for the fortified function compared to the\noriginal Branin-Hoo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 01:20:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

Results: This paper proposes a novel\nmodel called \"Knowledge-guided Convolutional Networks (KCN)\" to leverage prior\nknowledge for CDR extraction. The proposed model first learns knowledge\nrepresentations including entity embeddings and relation embeddings from KBs.\nThen, entity embeddings are used to control the propagation of context features\ntowards a chemical-disease pair with gated convolutions. After that, relation\nembeddings are employed to further capture the weighted context features by a\nshared attention pooling. Finally, the weighted context features containing\nadditional knowledge information are used for CDR extraction. Experiments on\nthe BioCreative V CDR dataset show that the proposed KCN achieves 71.28%\nF1-score, which outperforms most of the state-of-the-art systems. Conclusions:\nThis paper proposes a novel CDR extraction model KCN to make full use of prior\nknowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that KCN could effectively\nintegrate prior knowledge and contexts for the performance improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 02:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

It is therefore important to fully characterize\nthe roles of quantum measurement encompassing information gain, state\ndisturbance and reversibility, together with their fundamental relations.\nNumerous efforts have been made to obtain the trade-off between information\ngain and state disturbance, which becomes a practical basis for secure\ninformation processing. However, a complete information balance is necessary to\ninclude the reversibility of quantum measurement, which constitutes an integral\npart of practical quantum information processing.

The cornerstone\nof this approach is a technique to learn a directly follows graph called mutual\nfingerprint from the event logs of the two variants.

We observed that the\nmass accretion rate to one SMBH exceeds the Eddington accretion rate when the\ndistance between two black holes (BHs) rapidly decreases. However, this rapid\naccretion phase does not last for more than $10^7$ yrs, and it drops to $\\sim$\n10% of the Eddington rate in the quasi-steady accretion phase. The rapid\naccretion is caused by the angular momentum transfer from the gas to the\nstellar component, and the moderate accretion in the quasi-steady phase is\ncaused {by turbulent viscosity and gravitational torque in the disk. The second\nmerger event enhances the mass accretion to the BHs; however, this phase takes\nplace on a similar timescale to the first merger event.

Those properties are the\nmineralogical and elemental composition, grain density, bulk density of\ncobbles, magnetic susceptibility, mechanical strength of cobbles, and volatile\nrelease patterns. To evaluate the regolith simulant's particle sizing we use a\nreference model that was based upon the sample returned from Itokawa by\nHayabusa, the boulder count on Hayabusa, and four cases of disrupted asteroids\nthat indicate particle sizing of the subsurface material. Compared to these\nreferences, the simulant has high figures of merit, indicating it is a good\nchoice for a wide range of scientific and engineering applications. We\nrecommend this methodology to the wider asteroid community and in the near\nfuture will apply it to additional asteroid simulants currently under\ndevelopment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 05:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

In-situ observations of the counterparts of\nCMEs, especially magnetic clouds (MCs) near the Earth, have provided\nmeasurements of the structure and total flux of CME flux ropes. However, it has\nbeen difficult to measure these properties in the erupting CME flux rope, in\nparticular in the pre-existing flux rope. In this work, we propose a model to\nestimate the toroidal flux of the pre-existing flux rope by subtracting the\nflux contributed by magnetic reconnection during the eruption from the flux\nmeasured in the MC. The flux by the reconnection is derived from geometric\nproperties of two-ribbon flares based on a quasi-2D reconnection model. We then\napply the model to four CME/flare events and find that the ratio of toroidal\nflux in the pre-existing flux rope to that of the associated MC lies in the\nrange of 0.40--0.88. It indicates that the toroidal flux of the pre-existing\nflux rope has an important contribution to that of the CME flux rope and is\nusually at least as large as the flux arising from the eruption process for the\nselected events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 05:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

They should be well-suited to anyone that wants to learn category\ntheory from scratch and has a scientific mind. There is no need to know\nadvanced mathematics, nor any of the disciplines where category theory is\ntraditionally applied, such as algebraic geometry or theoretical computer\nscience. The only knowledge that is assumed from the reader is linear algebra.\nAll concepts are explained by giving concrete examples from different,\nnon-specialized areas of mathematics (such as basic group theory, graph theory,\nand probability). Not every example is helpful for every reader, but hopefully\nevery reader can find at least one helpful example per concept. The reader is\nencouraged to read all the examples, this way they may even learn something new\nabout a different field.\n  Particular emphasis is given to the Yoneda lemma and its significance, with\nboth intuitive explanations, detailed proofs, and specific examples. Another\ncommon theme in these notes is the relationship between categories and directed\nmultigraphs, which is treated in detail. From the applied point of view, this\nshows why categorical thinking can help whenever some process is taking place\non a graph. From the pure math point of view, this can be seen as the\n1-dimensional first step into the theory of simplicial sets. Finally, monads\nand comonads are treated on an equal footing, differently to most literature in\nwhich comonads are often overlooked as \"just the dual to monads\".

Compared with previous 3D point CNNs which perform\nconvolution on nearby points, GS-Net can aggregate point features in a more\nglobal way.

This design allows GS-Net to\nefficiently capture both local and holistic geometric features such as\nsymmetry, curvature, convexity and connectivity. Theoretically, we show the\nnearest neighbors of each point in Eigenvalue space are invariant to rotation\nand translation.

We show\nthat the training reflection matrix design for discrete phase shifts greatly\ndiffers from that for continuous phase shifts, and thus the corresponding\npassive beamforming should be optimized by taking into account the correlated\nchannel estimation error due to discrete phase shifts.

A novel\nhierarchical training reflection design is proposed to progressively estimate\nIRS elements' channels over multiple blocks by exploiting IRS-elements grouping\nand partition.

The trained generative model (decoder) is then\ncombined with a noise model at test time to estimate the clean speech. In the\nspeech enhancement phase (test time), the initialization of the latent\nvariables, which describe the generative process of clean speech via decoder,\nis crucial, as the overall inference problem is non-convex. This is usually\ndone by using the output of the trained encoder where the noisy audio and clean\nvisual data are given as input.

In particular,\nwe determine the multipartite entanglement distribution capacity of a quantum\nnetwork, in which the nodes are connected through lossy bosonic quantum\nchannels.

Essentially,\nin the radiation dominated universe, PBHs could form by the gravitational\ncollapse of overdense primordial perturbations produced during inflation. In\nthis picture, one important ingredient is the threshold of density contrast,\nwhich defines the onset of PBH formation. In the literature, most of the\nestimations of threshold, no matter numerically or analytically, are\nimplemented in the framework of general relativity (GR). In this paper, by\nperforming analytic estimations, we point out that the threshold for PBH\nformation depends on the gravitational theory under consideration. In GR, given\na fixed equation of state, the analytic estimations adopted in this paper give\na constant value of the formation threshold. If the theory is characterized by\nadditional mass scales other than the Planck mass, the estimated threshold of\ndensity contrast may depend on the energy scale of the universe at the time of\nPBH formation. In this paper, we consider the Eddington-inspired-Born-Infeld\ngravity as an example. We find that the threshold would be enhanced if the\nBorn-Infeld coupling constant is positive, and would be suppressed for a\nnegative coupling constant. Also, we show explicitly that the threshold depends\non the energy scale of the universe at the PBH formation time. This conclusion\nis expected to be valid for any gravitational theory characterized by\nadditional mass scales, suggesting the possibility of testing gravitational\ntheories with PBHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 08:54:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 04:35:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 09:55:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 06:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

We consider the tractability yardstick of answer enumeration with a\npolylogarithmic delay after a linear-time preprocessing phase. Such an\nevaluation is obtained by constructing, in the preprocessing phase, a data\nstructure that supports polylogarithmic-delay enumeration. In this paper, we\nseek a structure that supports the more demanding task of a \"random\npermutation\": polylogarithmic-delay enumeration in truly random order.\nEnumeration of this kind is required if downstream applications assume that the\nintermediate results are representative of the whole result set in a\nstatistically valuable manner. An even more demanding task is that of a \"random\naccess\": polylogarithmic-time retrieval of an answer whose position is given.\n  We establish that the free-connex acyclic CQs are tractable in all three\nsenses: enumeration, random-order enumeration, and random access; and in the\nabsence of self-joins, it follows from past results that every other CQ is\nintractable by each of the three (under some fine-grained complexity\nassumptions). However, the three yardsticks are separated in the case of a\nunion of CQs (UCQ): while a union of free-connex acyclic CQs has a tractable\nenumeration, it may (provably) admit no random access. For such UCQs we devise\na random-order enumeration whose delay is logarithmic in expectation. We also\nidentify a subclass of UCQs for which we can provide random access with\npolylogarithmic access time. Finally, we present an implementation and an\nempirical study that show a considerable practical superiority of our\nrandom-order enumeration approach over state-of-the-art alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 09:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

We examine the role played by forbidden\ntransitions in these distributions and how this differs across different\nenergies and nuclear target masses.

Due\nto the uncertain traffic in the network between APs and edge servers, the job\nuploading delay can not be predicted accurately. Specifically, the job arrivals\nat the APs, the job uploading delay from APs to edge servers and the job\ncomputation time at the edge servers are all modeled as random variables. Since\neach job dispatching decision will affect the system state in the future, we\nformulate the joint optimization of jobs dispatching at all the APs and all the\nscheduling time slots as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP). The\nminimization objective is a discounted measurement of the average processing\ntime per job, including the uploading delay, the waiting time and the\ncomputation time at the edge servers. In this problem, the approximate MDP\nshould be adopted to address the curse of dimensionality. Conventional\nlow-complexity approximate solution of MDP is usually hard to predict the\nperformance analytically. In this paper, a novel approximate MDP solution\nframework is proposed via one-step policy iteration over a baseline policy,\nwhere the analytical performance bound can be obtained. Moreover, since the\nexpression of the approximate value function is derived, the value iteration in\nconventional methods can be eliminated, which can essentially reduce the\ncomputation complexity. It is shown by simulations that proposed low-complexity\nalgorithm has significantly better performance than various benchmark schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 11:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

The stability and quantification of the rate of\nconvergence of the Mapper to the Reeb space has been studied a lot in recent\nworks [BBMW19, CO17, CMO18, MW16], focusing on the case where a scalar-valued\nfilter is used for the computation of Mapper. On the other hand, much less is\nknown in the multivariate case, when the codomain of the filter is\n$\\mathbb{R}^p$, and in the general case, when it is a general metric space $(Z,\nd_Z)$, instead of $\\mathbb{R}$. The few results that are available in this\nsetting [DMW17, MW16] can only handle continuous topological spaces and cannot\nbe used as is for finite metric spaces representing data, such as point clouds\nand distance matrices. In this article, we introduce a slight modification of\nthe usual Mapper construction and we give risk bounds for estimating the Reeb\nspace using this estimator. Our approach applies in particular to the setting\nwhere the filter function used to compute Mapper is also estimated from data,\nsuch as the eigenfunctions of PCA. Our results are given with respect to the\nGromov-Hausdorff distance, computed with specific filter-based pseudometrics\nfor Mappers and Reeb spaces defined in [DMW17].

Recent advancements in electrode designs and micro-fabrication\ntechnology has allowed existence of microelectrode arrays with hundreds of\nchannels for single-cell recordings. In such electrophysiological recordings,\neach implanted micro-electrode can record the activities of more than one\nneuron in its vicinity. Recording the activities of multiple neurons may also\nbe referred to as multiple unit activity. However, for any further analysis,\nthe main goal is to isolate the activity of each recorded neuron and thus\ncalled single-unit activity. This process may also be referred to as spike\nsorting or spike classification. Recent approaches to extract SUA are time\nconsuming, mainly due to the requirement of human intervention at various\nstages of spike sorting pipeline. Lack of standardization is another drawback\nof the current available approaches. Therefore, in this study we proposed a\nstandard spike sorter: SpikeDeep-Classifier, a fully automatic spike sorting\nalgorithm. Approach. We proposed a novel spike sorting pipeline, based on a set\nof supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. We used supervised, deep\nlearning-based algorithms for extracting meaningful channels and removing\nbackground activities (noise) from the extracted channels. We also showed that\nthe process of clustering becomes straight-forward, once the noise/artifact is\ncompletely removed from the data. Therefore, in the next stage, we applied a\nsimple clustering algorithm (K-mean) with predefined maximum number of\nclusters.

Making the parameters learn-able, makes the activation\nfunction more dynamic and capable to adapt as per the requirements of its\nneighboring layers. The introduced slope parameter is independent of other\nparameters in the activation function. The concept was applied to ReLU to\ndevelop Dual Line and DualParametric ReLU activation function. Evaluation on\nMNIST and CIFAR10 show that the proposed activation function Dual Line achieves\ntop-5 position for mean accuracy among 43 activation functions tested with\nLENET4, LENET5, and WideResNet architectures. This is the first time more than\n40 activation functions were analyzed on MNIST andCIFAR10 dataset at the same\ntime. The study on the distribution of positive slope parameter beta indicates\nthat the activation function adapts as per the requirements of the neighboring\nlayers.

However, the\nheterogeneous HK model is difficult to analyze - even the most basic property\nof convergence is still open to prove. For the first time, this paper takes\ninto consideration heterogeneous HK models with environment or communication\nnoise. Under environment noise, it has been revealed that the heterogeneous HK\nmodel with or without global information has a phase transition for the upper\nlimit of the maximum opinion difference, and has a critical noise amplitude\ndepending on the minimal confidence threshold for quasi-synchronization. In\naddition, the convergence time to the quasi-synchronization is bounded by a\nnegative exponential distribution. The heterogeneous HK model with global\ninformation and communication noise is also analyzed. Finally, for the basic HK\nmodel with communication noise, we show that the heterogeneous case exhibits a\ndifferent behavior regarding quasi-synchronization from the homogenous case.\nInterestingly, raising the confidence thresholds of constituent agents may\nbreak quasi-synchronization. Our results reveal that the heterogeneity of\nindividuals is harmful to synchronization, which may be the reason why the\nsynchronization of opinions is hard to reach in reality, even within that of a\nsmall group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 12:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

The composite is deployed with retractable micro-undulations\nof the elastomer inside each weave mesh, enabling dramatic changes of the\ncontact interface with the opposing surface on LCE actuation, which is induced\ne.g. by a change in temperature (T).

At an elevated T (50C, isotropic phase), the\nundulations of LCE surface are retracted within the thickness of the textile,\nand the contacts are limited to small regions around overlapping textile\nfibers, lowering the friction dramatically.

Two classes\nof quantile diffusions are identified: the first, which we largely focus on,\nfeatures a dynamic random quantile level and allows for direct interpretation\nof the resulting quantile process characteristics such as location, scale,\nskewness and kurtosis, in terms of the model parameters. The second type are\nfunction-valued quantile diffusions and are driven by stochastic parameter\nprocesses, which determine the entire quantile function at each point in time.\nBy the proposed innovative and simple -- yet powerful -- construction method,\nquantile processes are obtained by transforming the marginals of a diffusion\nprocess under a composite map consisting of a distribution and a quantile\nfunction. Such maps, analogous to rank transmutation maps, produce the\nmarginals of the resulting quantile process. We discuss the relationship and\ndifferences between our approach and existing methods and characterisations of\nquantile processes in discrete and continuous time. As an example of an\napplication of quantile diffusions, we show how probability measure\ndistortions, a form of dynamic tilting, can be induced.

QBism too takes a Bayesian\nstance on the probabilities of quantum theory, but its probabilities are the\npersonal degrees of belief a sufficiently-schooled agent holds for the\nconsequences of her actions on the external world. Thus QBism has two levels of\nthe personal where the Pitowskyan view has one. The differences go further.\nMost important for the technical side of both views is the quantum mechanical\nBorn Rule, but in the Pitowskyan development it is a theorem, not a postulate,\narising in the way of Gleason from the primary empirical assumption of a\nnon-Boolean algebra.

The adiabatic evolution of the state involved in STIRAP,\ncalled adiabatic passage, guarantees its robustness against control errors, but\nalso leads to problems of low efficiency and decoherence. Here we propose and\nexperimentally demonstrate an alternative approach, termed stimulated Raman\n\"user-defined\" passage (STIRUP), where a parameterized state is employed for\nconstructing desired evolutions to replace the adiabatic passage in STIRAP. The\nuser-defined passages can be flexibly designed for optimizing different\nobjectives for different tasks, e.g. minimizing leakage error.

The identification of drugs targeting\nthe regulatory circuits of functional RNAs depends on knowing its family, a\ntask which is known as RNA sequence classification. State-of-the-art small\nnoncoding RNA classification methodologies take secondary structural features\nas input. However, in such classification, feature extraction approaches only\ntake global characteristics into account and completely oversight co-relative\neffect of local structures. Furthermore secondary structure based approaches\nincorporate high dimensional feature space which proves computationally\nexpensive.

Physical effects like the\nCasimir effect have alternate description in terms of retarded interaction\nbetween charged matter, due to quantum fluctuations of material dipoles.\nHowever, there are simple quantum optical configurations where the hypothetical\nquantum vacuum modes seem to assume an essential real role in the observable\nquantum noise of optical signals. I present the logical and theoretical basis\nof a decisive test that relies on the comparisons of balanced homodyne\ndetection with a novel differential scheme of balanced wave-front division\ndetection, when the two real optical beams at the detectors are derived from\none coherent beam as input. Both ideal and practical configurations of my\nexperimental test are discussed. Results from the experiments on balanced\ndetection, beam localization of optical beams, and atomic Bose-Einstein\ncondensates are used to reach definite conclusions against the reality of the\nwave modes of quantum vacuum.

This is consistent with the demonstrated applications of squeezed\nlight in interferometry and quantum metrology. This result achieves consistency\nbetween quantum noise in quantum optics and observational cosmology based on\ngeneral relativity, by avoiding the wave modes of quantum vacuum with divergent\nzero-point energy density. Generalization from the limited sphere of quantum\noptics to general quantum field theories promises the complete solution to the\nproblem of a divergent cosmological constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 14:21:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-25"}

These may, however,\ncontain biases, artifacts, or errors that have gone unnoticed and are\nexploitable by the model. In the worst case, the trained model does not learn a\nvalid and generalizable strategy to solve the problem it was trained for, and\nbecomes a 'Clever-Hans' (CH) predictor that bases its decisions on spurious\ncorrelations in the training data, potentially yielding an unrepresentative or\nunfair, and possibly even hazardous predictor. In this paper, we contribute by\nproviding a comprehensive analysis framework based on a scalable statistical\nanalysis of attributions from explanation methods for large data corpora. Based\non a recent technique - Spectral Relevance Analysis - we propose the following\ntechnical contributions and resulting findings: (a) a scalable quantification\nof artifactual and poisoned classes where the machine learning models under\nstudy exhibit CH behavior, (b) several approaches denoted as Class Artifact\nCompensation (ClArC), which are able to effectively and significantly reduce a\nmodel's CH behavior. I.e., we are able to un-Hans models trained on (poisoned)\ndatasets, such as the popular ImageNet data corpus. We demonstrate that ClArC,\ndefined in a simple theoretical framework, may be implemented as part of a\nNeural Network's training or fine-tuning process, or in a post-hoc manner by\ninjecting additional layers, preventing any further propagation of undesired CH\nfeatures, into the network architecture.

In\nparticular, the combination of therapeutic bacteria and conventional\nchemotherapy leads to dramatically high anti-tumor efficay. However, the\nmechanisms of the synergy, in part, remain unclear. To aim for understanding\nthe mechanisms of the synergy of the combination therapy, simultaneous delivery\nof C. novyi-NT and chemotherapeutic agents in tumors is mathematically modeled\nfrom porous media approach. Simulated doxorubicin concentration in tumors after\nDoxil administration with or without bacteria agreed reasonably well with\nexperimental literature. The simulated doxorubicin concentration in tumors by\nthe combination of Doxil and C. novyi-NT is over twice higher than that of\nDoxil alone, as observed in previous experimental literature. This enhanced\nconcentration is because of the degradation of extracellular matrix of collagen\nby bacterial proteolytic activity, which reduced interstitial fluid pressure in\ntumors by increasing hydraulic conductivity of interstitium, and thus increases\nconvection through vessel walls. Additionally, solid stress alleviation caused\nby collagen degradation increases vessel density by decompressing blood\nvessels. On the other hand, the simulated doxorubicin concentration in tumors\nfor non-liposomal doxorubicin is not enhanced by C. novyi-NT because vascular\npermeability of free-doxorubicin is larger than Doxil, and thus, increased but\nrelatively small convection across vessel walls is outweighed by the efflux due\nto increased interstitial flow. A strategy to further enhance this combination\ntherapy is discussed with sensitivity analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 07:45:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-06"}

Therefore, several models have been proposed for\nhysteresis simulation in different fields; however, almost neither of them can\nbe utilized universally. In this paper by inspiring of Preisach Neural Network\nwhich was inspired by the Preisach model that basically stemmed from Madelungs\nrules and using the learning capability of the neural networks, an adaptive\nuniversal model for hysteresis is introduced and called Extended Preisach\nNeural Network Model. It is comprised of input, output and, two hidden layers.\nThe input and output layers contain linear neurons while the first hidden layer\nincorporates neurons called Deteriorating Stop neurons, which their activation\nfunction follows Deteriorating Stop operator. Deteriorating Stop operators can\ngenerate non-congruent hysteresis loops. The second hidden layer includes\nSigmoidal neurons. Adding the second hidden layer, helps the neural network\nlearn non-Masing and asymmetric hysteresis loops very smoothly. At the input\nlayer, besides input data the rate at which input data changes, is included as\nwell in order to give the model the capability of learning rate-dependent\nhysteresis loops. Hence, the proposed approach has the capability of the\nsimulation of both rate-independent and rate-dependent hysteresis with either\ncongruent or non-congruent loops as well as symmetric and asymmetric loops. A\nnew hybridized algorithm has been adopted for training the model which is based\non a combination of the Genetic Algorithm and the optimization method of\nsub-gradient with space dilatation. The generality of the proposed model has\nbeen evaluated by applying it to various hysteresis from different areas of\nengineering with different characteristics. The results show that the model is\nsuccessful in the identification of the considered hystereses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 18:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}
