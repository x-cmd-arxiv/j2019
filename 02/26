Great effort and ingenuity is required to construct viable functional\nforms and find accurate parameterizations for potentials using traditional\napproaches. Machine-learning has emerged as an effective alternative approach\nto develop accurate and robust interatomic potentials. Starting with a very\ngeneral model form, the potential is learned directly from a database of\nelectronic structure calculations and therefore can be viewed as a multiscale\nlink between quantum and classical atomistic simulations. Risk of inaccurate\nextrapolation exists outside the narrow range of time- and length-scales where\nthe two methods can be directly compared. In this work, we use the Spectral\nNeighbor Analysis Potential (SNAP) and show how a fit can be produced with\nminimal interpolation errors which is also robust in extrapolating beyond\ntraining. To demonstrate the method, we have developed a new tungsten-beryllium\npotential suitable for the full range of binary compositions. Subsequently,\nlarge-scale molecular dynamics simulations were performed of high energy Be\natom implantation onto the (001) surface of solid tungsten. The new machine\nlearned W-Be potential generates a population of implantation structures\nconsistent with quantum calculations of defect formation energies. A very\nshallow (<2nm) average Be implantation depth is predicted which may explain\nITER diverter degradation in the presence of beryllium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 16:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 17:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

Our method combines two different approaches, motion compensation\nschemes and hierarchical compression methods, to exploit redundancies in LFI.\nThe motion compensation schemes capture the redundancies in local regions of\nthe LFI efficiently (local coherence) and hierarchical schemes capture the\nredundancies present across the entire LFI (global coherence). Our hybrid\napproach combines the two schemes effectively capturing both local as well as\nglobal coherence to improve the overall compression rate. We compute a tree\nfrom LFI using a hierarchical scheme and use phase shifted motion compensation\ntechniques at each level of the hierarchy. Our representation provides random\naccess to the pixel values of the light field, which makes it suitable for\ninteractive rendering applications using a small run-time memory footprint.

The underlying intrinsic shape of\nthe nucleus is tetrahedral, as in the na\\\"ive alpha-particle model and other\ncluster models, and A, E and F vibrational phonons are included. The A- and\nF-phonons are treated in the harmonic approximation, but the E-vibrations are\nextended into a two-dimensional E-manifold of D2-symmetric, four-alpha-particle\nconfigurations, following earlier work. This allows for the underlying\ntetrahedral configuration to deform through a square configuration into the\ndual tetrahedron, so there is tunnelling between the tetrahedron and its dual,\nwith the associated breaking of parity doubling. However, E-manifold states can\nstill be interpreted in terms of E-phonons. Rotational excitations of the\nvibrational states are analysed as in the classic work of Dennison, Robson and\nothers, with centrifugal corrections to the rotational energy spectrum\nincluded. States with F-phonons require Coriolis corrections too. The\nfirst-excited $0^+$ state at 6.05 MeV is modelled as a state with two\nE-phonons; this allows a good fit of the lowest $2^+$ and $2^-$ states as\nexcitations with one E-phonon. The Coriolis parameter $\\zeta$ is chosen\npositive to ensure the right splitting of the $3^+$ and $3^-$ states near 11\nMeV. Altogether, about 80 states with isospin zero are predicted below 20 MeV,\nand these match rather well the more than 60 experimentally tabulated states.\nSeveral high-spin states are predicted, up to spin 9 and energy 30 MeV, and\nthese match some of the high-spin, natural parity states in this energy range\nthat have been observed.

It remains unclear whether\nthis striking variety arises due to a dominant power input mechanism involving\nmany underlying parameters, or due to contributions by different progenitor\nchannels. In this work, we propose that a systematic quantitative study of SLSN\nlightcurve timescales and shape properties, such as symmetry around peak\nluminosity, can be used to characterize these enthralling stellar explosions.\nWe find that applying clustering analysis on the properties of model SLSN\nlightcurves, powered by either a magnetar spin-down or a supernova\nejecta-circumstellar interaction mechanism, can yield a distinction between the\ntwo, especially in terms of lightcurve symmetry. We show that most events in\nthe observed SLSN sample with well-constrained lightcurves and early detections\nstrongly associate with clusters dominated by circumstellar interaction models.\nMagnetar spin-down models also show association at a lower degree but have\ndifficulty in reproducing fast-evolving and fully symmetric lightcurves. We\nbelieve this is due to the truncated nature of the circumstellar interaction\nshock energy input as compared to decreasing but continuous power input sources\nlike magnetar spin-down and radioactive Ni-56 decay.

For galaxies with detected rotation we assess\ntrends between their kinematics and mass, sSFR, and baryon surface density\n($\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{bar},e}$). Intrinsic dispersion correlates most with\n$\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{bar},e}$ and velocity correlates most with mass. By comparing\ndynamical and baryonic masses, we find that galaxies at $z\\sim 1.4-3.8$ are\nbaryon dominated within their effective radii ($R_E$), with Mdyn/Mbaryon\nincreasing over time. The inferred baryon fractions within $R_E$,\n$f_{\\mathrm{bar}}$, decrease over time, even at fixed mass, size, or surface\ndensity. At fixed redshift, $f_{\\mathrm{bar}}$ does not appear to vary with\nstellar mass but increases with decreasing $R_E$ and increasing\n$\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{bar},e}$. For galaxies at $z\\geq2$, the median inferred baryon\nfractions generally exceed 100%. We discuss possible explanations and future\navenues to resolve this tension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 14:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

The pattern shows only weak changes with\nGalactocentric radius R and little change in strength in particular with the\nvertical energy E_z of the stars or respectively the distance to the Galactic\nplane |z|. The pattern is to first order symmetric around the plane, i.e. has\nno significant odd terms in z. There is weak phase shift with the pattern\nmoving towards slightly lower L_z (i.e. trailing) with |z| and E_z. However, we\nobserve a highly significant phase shift in Galactic azimuth phi, which is\ndifferent for different peaks. The peak around L_z ~ 2100 kpc km/s only shows a\nweak change with galactic azimuth, while the rest of the pattern shows a\nclearly detectable shift of d L_z /d phi = (200 +/- 22) kpc km/s/rad.

Existing distributed\naverage consensus algorithms require each node to exchange and disclose state\ninformation to its neighbors, which is undesirable in cases where the state is\nprivate or contains sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach that avoids disclosing individual state information in average\nconsensus by letting each node decompose its state into two sub-states. For\neach node, one of the two sub-states involves in computation and inter-node\ninteractions as if it were the original state, while the other sub-state\ninteracts only with the first sub-state of the same node, being completely\ninvisible to other nodes. The initial values of the two sub-states are chosen\nrandomly but with their mean fixed to the initial value of the original state,\nwhich is key to guarantee convergence to the desired consensus value. In direct\ncontrast to differential-privacy based privacy-preserving average-consensus\napproaches which enable privacy by compromising accuracy in the consensus\nvalue, the proposed approach can guarantee convergence to the \\emph{exact}\ndesired value without any error.

The process of calibration involves a number\nof parties which must collaborate to support calibration. Calibration checks\noften precede safety-critical operations such as preparing a robot for surgery,\nrequiring inter-party interaction to complete checks. At the same time, the\nparties involved in a calibration ecosystem may share an adversarial\nrelationship with a subset of other parties. For instance, a surgical robot\nmanufacturer may wish to hide the identities of third-parties from the operator\n(hospital), in order to maintain confidentiality of business relationships\naround its robot products. Thus, information flows that reveal\nwho-calibrates-for-whom need to be managed to ensure confidentiality.\nSimilarly, information about what-is-being-calibrated and\nhow-often-it-is-calibrated may compromise operational confidentiality. For\nexample, calibration-verification of connected medical devices may reveal the\ntiming of surgical procedures and compromise PII when combined with other meta\ninformation. We show that the challenge of managing information flows between\nthe parties involved in calibration cannot be met by any of the classical\naccess control models, as any one of them or a simple conjunction of a subset\nsuch as the lattice model fails to meet the desired access control\nrequirements.

We study the case for\nunification, system properties, and develop an XACML-based authorisation\nframework which enforces the unified model. Upon evaluation against a baseline\nsimple conjunction of the three models individually, our unified model\noutperforms this, demonstrating it is capable of solving the novel access\ncontrol challenges thrown up by digital-calibration supply chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 19:45:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 11:54:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 11:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-02"}

Therefore, a framework combining with a deep clustering (DeepCluster)\nmodule is developed for STTP at largescale networks in this paper. The\nDeepCluster module is proposed to supervise the representation learning in a\nvisualized way from the large unlabeled dataset. More specifically, to fully\nexploit the traffic periodicity, the raw series is first split into a number of\nsub-series for triplets generation. The convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\nwith triplet loss are utilized to extract the features of shape by transferring\nthe series into visual images.

Given a sudden looming visual stimulus at hover,\na hummingbird initiates a fast backward translation coupled with a 180-degree\nyaw turn, which is followed by instant posture stabilization in just under 10\nwingbeats. Consider the wingbeat frequency of 40Hz, this aggressive maneuver is\ncarried out in just 0.2 seconds. Inspired by the hummingbirds' near-maximal\nperformance during such extreme maneuvers, we developed a flight control\nstrategy and experimentally demonstrated that such maneuverability can be\nachieved by an at-scale 12-gram hummingbird robot equipped with just two\nactuators. The proposed hybrid control policy combines model-based nonlinear\ncontrol with model-free reinforcement learning.

We aimed to\ndetermine if there are any relationships between the QPP period and other\nproperties of the flaring region, using the sample of flares with QPPs from\nPugh et al. (2017b). If any relationships exist then these can be compared with\nscaling laws for the theoretical QPP mechanisms. To obtain the flaring region\nproperties we made use of the AIA 1600 and HMI data. The AIA 1600 images allow\nthe flare ribbons to be seen while the HMI magnetograms allow the positive and\nnegative magnetic polarity ribbons to be distinguished and the magnetic\nproperties determined. The ribbon properties calculated in this study were the\nribbon separation distance, area, total unsigned magnetic flux, and average\nmagnetic field strength. Only the flares that occurred within \\pm 60{\\deg} of\nthe solar disk centre were included, which meant a sample of 20 flares with 22\nQPP signals. Positive correlations were found between the QPP period and the\nribbon properties. The strongest correlations were with the separation distance\nand magnetic flux. Because these ribbon properties also correlate with the\nflare duration, and the relationship between the QPP period and flare duration\nmay be influenced by observational bias, we also made use of simulated data to\ncheck if artificial correlations could be introduced. These simulations show\nthat although QPPs cannot be detected for certain combinations of QPP period\nand flare duration, this does not introduce an apparent correlation. There is\nevidence of relationships between the QPP period and flare ribbon properties,\nand in the future the derived scaling laws between these properties can be\ncompared to equivalent scaling laws for theoretical QPP mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:31:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

We tackle the\nchallenging problem of image-to-image translation where the domains are defined\nby high-level shapes and contexts, as well as including significant clutter and\nheterogeneity.

With this new\nthree-network system, we no longer need to constrain the generators with the\nubiquitous cycle-consistency restraint. As a result, the generators can learn\nmappings between more complex domains that differ from each other by large\ndifferences - not just style or texture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

Using the\nmachinery of global games and variational optimization techniques, we analyze\nthe revenue implications of such induced externalities in the form of rebates.\nWe identify optimal profitable designs while unraveling the main drivers of\nprofit and further elucidate the main practical barriers associated with their\nimplementation and show how these difficulties can be handled. The key insight\nof our rebate design is monetizing the strategic uncertainty in consumers'\nbeliefs on others' valuations. The common externality induced in consumers'\nutilities as a sales-based rebate essentially enables the seller to elicit\ndifferent prices at different valuations, given the heterogeneity of the\nbeliefs on sales volume and hence on the rebate. Our analysis indicates that a\nmechanism that creates positive externalities will in fact reduce the profit\nbecause it lowers the expected prices at high valuations.

This article develops an optimal and fast\nreal-time resource slicing framework that maximizes the long-term return of the\nnetwork provider while taking into account the uncertainty of resource demand\nfrom tenants. Specifically, we first propose a novel system model which enables\nthe network provider to effectively slice various types of resources to\ndifferent classes of users under separate virtual slices. We then capture the\nreal-time arrival of slice requests by a semi-Markov decision process. To\nobtain the optimal resource allocation policy under the dynamics of slicing\nrequests, e.g., uncertain service time and resource demands, a Q-learning\nalgorithm is often adopted in the literature. However, such an algorithm is\nnotorious for its slow convergence, especially for problems with large\nstate/action spaces. This makes Q-learning practically inapplicable to our case\nin which multiple resources are simultaneously optimized. To tackle it, we\npropose a novel network slicing approach with an advanced deep learning\narchitecture, called deep dueling that attains the optimal average reward much\nfaster than the conventional Q-learning algorithm. This property is especially\ndesirable to cope with real-time resource requests and the dynamic demands of\nusers. Extensive simulations show that the proposed framework yields up to 40%\nhigher long-term average return while being few thousand times faster, compared\nwith state of the art network slicing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 01:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

Interestingly, for a planar graph,\nedge deletion corresponds to edge contraction in its planar dual (and more\ngenerally, for a graphical matroid and its dual). Moreover, with respect to the\ndynamics induced by the graph Laplacian (e.g., diffusion), deletion and\ncontraction are physical manifestations of two reciprocal limits: edge weights\nof $0$ and $\\infty$, respectively.

Previous\napproaches allow the user to specify domain knowledge in the form of logical\nconstraints (e.g., functional dependency and denial constraints). We extend the\nconstraint-based approach by introducing a novel class of statistical\nconstraints (SCs). An SC treats each column as a random variable, and enforces\nan independence or dependence relationship between two (or a few) random\nvariables. Statistical constraints are expressive, allowing the user to specify\na wide range of domain knowledge, beyond traditional integrity constraints.\nFurthermore, they work harmoniously with downstream statistical modeling. We\ndevelop CODED, an SC-Oriented Data Error Detection system that supports three\nkey tasks: (1) Checking whether an SC is violated or not on a given dataset,\n(2) Identify the top-k records that contribute the most to the violation of an\nSC, and (3) Checking whether a set of input SCs have conflicts or not. We\npresent effective solutions for each task.

Women with PSS-10 less than 19 served as control group (CG).\nSetting: Klinikum rechts der Isar of the Technical University of Munich.\nPopulation: Singleton 3rd trimester pregnant women. Methods: Transabdominal\nfetal electrocardiograms (fECG) were recorded. We deployed a signal processing\nalgorithm termed bivariate phase-rectified signal averaging (BPRSA) to quantify\ncoupling between mHR and fHR resulting in a fetal stress index (FSI). Maternal\nhair cortisol was measured at birth. Differences were assumed to be significant\nfor p value less than 0.05. Main Outcome Measures: Differences for FSI between\nboth groups. Results: We screened 1500 women enrolling 538 of which 16.5 %\nshowed a PSS-10 score equal or above 19 at 34+0 weeks. Fifty five women\neventually comprised the SG and n=55 served as CG. Median PSS was 22.0 (IQR\n21.0-24.0) in the SG and 9.0 (6.0-12.0) in the CG, respectively. Maternal hair\ncortisol was higher in SG than CG at 86.6 (48.0-169.2) versus 53.0 (34.4-105.9)\npg/mg. At 36+5 weeks, FSI was significantly higher in fetuses of stressed\nmothers when compared to controls [0.43 (0.18-0.85) versus 0.00 (-0.49-0.18)].\nConclusion: Our findings show a persistent effect of PS affecting fetuses in\nthe last trimester.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 05:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

Despite the successful\napplication of FM and its many deep learning variants, treating every feature\ninteraction fairly may degrade the performance. For example, the interactions\nof a useless feature may introduce noises; the importance of a feature may also\ndiffer when interacting with different features. In this work, we propose a\nnovel model named \\emph{Interaction-aware Factorization Machine} (IFM) by\nintroducing Interaction-Aware Mechanism (IAM), which comprises the\n\\emph{feature aspect} and the \\emph{field aspect}, to learn flexible\ninteractions on two levels. The feature aspect learns feature interaction\nimportance via an attention network while the field aspect learns the feature\ninteraction effect as a parametric similarity of the feature interaction vector\nand the corresponding field interaction prototype. IFM introduces more\nstructured control and learns feature interaction importance in a stratified\nmanner, which allows for more leverage in tweaking the interactions on both\nfeature-wise and field-wise levels. Besides, we give a more generalized\narchitecture and propose Interaction-aware Neural Network (INN) and DeepIFM to\ncapture higher-order interactions. To further improve both the performance and\nefficiency of IFM, a sampling scheme is developed to select interactions based\non the field aspect importance.

However,\nmoving also costs energy consumption and a fundamental question is: what is the\nright balance between spending energy on moving versus on communication? To\nanswer this question, this paper proposes a joint graph mobility and\nbackscatter communication model. With the proposed model, the total energy\nminimization at UGV is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming\n(MINLP) problem. Furthermore, an efficient algorithm that achieves a local\noptimal solution is derived, and it leads to automatic trade-off between\nspending energy on moving versus on communication.

The first pass of the framework automatically generates\ntraining labels from the input recording itself, while model training and\nclassification is done during the second pass. The proposed framework utilizes\na reference directional model for obtaining a feature representation called\ndirectional embeddings (DE). This reference directional model acts as an\nacoustic model for bird vocalizations and is obtained using the mixtures of\nVon-Mises Fisher distribution (moVMF). The proposed DE space only contains\ninformation about bird vocalizations, while no information about the background\ndisturbances is reflected. The framework employs supervised information only\nfor obtaining the reference directional model and avoids the background\nmodeling. Hence, it can be regarded as semi-supervised in nature.

Most\nrecent approaches leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and achieve\npromising results. However, these methods are limited to detecting a fixed\nnumber of planes with certain learned order. To tackle this problem, we propose\na novel two-stage method based on associative embedding, inspired by its recent\nsuccess in instance segmentation. In the first stage, we train a CNN to map\neach pixel to an embedding space where pixels from the same plane instance have\nsimilar embeddings. Then, the plane instances are obtained by grouping the\nembedding vectors in planar regions via an efficient mean shift clustering\nalgorithm. In the second stage, we estimate the parameter for each plane\ninstance by considering both pixel-level and instance-level consistencies. With\nthe proposed method, we are able to detect an arbitrary number of planes.\nExtensive experiments on public datasets validate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of our method. Furthermore, our method runs at 30 fps at the testing\ntime, thus could facilitate many real-time applications such as visual SLAM and\nhuman-robot interaction.

We investigate the impact of adding a tree\nlayer on top of a sequential model by recursively composing subtree\nrepresentations (composition) in a transition-based parser that uses features\nextracted by a BiLSTM. Composition seems superfluous with such a model,\nsuggesting that BiLSTMs capture information about subtrees. We perform model\nablations to tease out the conditions under which composition helps. When\nablating the backward LSTM, performance drops and composition does not recover\nmuch of the gap.

To\ncapture history-based information, composition is better than a forward LSTM on\nits own, but it is even better to have a forward LSTM as part of a BiLSTM.

In the THU-Bi-Hand dataset, there are 447k pairs of stereo images\nof different hand shapes from 10 subjects with accurate 3D location annotations\nof the wrist and five fingertips. Captured with minimal restriction on the\nrange of hand motion, the dataset covers large global viewpoint space and hand\narticulation space. To better present the performance of fingertip localization\non THU-Bi-Hand, we propose a novel scheme termed Bi-stream Pose Guided Region\nEnsemble Network (Bi-Pose-REN). It extracts more representative feature regions\naround joint points in the feature maps under the guidance of the previously\nestimated pose. The feature regions are integrated hierarchically according to\nthe topology of hand joints to regress the refined hand pose. Bi-Pose-REN and\nseveral existing methods are evaluated on THU-Bi-Hand so that benchmarks are\nprovided for further research. Experimental results show that our new method\nhas achieved the best performance on THU-Bi-Hand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 08:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

In\ntypical open clusters in the Solar neighbourhood containing hundreds or\nthousands of member stars, ten to twenty per cent of Solar-mass member stars\nare expected to encounter another star at distances closer than 100 au. These\nclose encounters strongly perturb the planetary systems, directly causing\nejection of planets or their capture by the intruding star, as well as exciting\nthe orbits. Using extensive $N$-body simulations, we study such fly-by\nencounters between two Solar System analogues, each with four giant planets\nfrom Jupiter to Neptune. We quantify the rates of loss and capture immediately\nafter the encounter, e.g., the Neptune analogue is lost in one in four\nencounters within 100 au, and captured by the flying-by star in one in twelve\nencounters. We then perform long-term (up to 1 Gyr) simulations investigating\nthe ensuing post-encounter evolution. We show that large numbers of planets are\nremoved from systems due to planet--planet interactions and that captured\nplanets further enhance the system instability. While encounters can initially\nleave a planetary system containing more planets by inserting additional ones,\nthe long-term instability causes a net reduction in planet number. A captured\nplanet ends up on a retrograde orbit in half of the runs in which it survives\nfor 1 Gyr; also, a planet bound to its original host star but flipped during\nthe encounter may survive. Thus, encounters between planetary systems are a\nchannel to create counter-rotating planets, This would happen in around 1% of\nsystems, and such planets are potentially detectable through astrometry or\ndirect imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 08:52:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 15:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

Unusual PEO cathodic micro-discharges have been observed and\ninvestigated. It is shown that the cathodic micro-discharges exhibit a\ncollective intermittent behavior which is discussed in terms of charge\naccumulations at the layer/electrolyte and layer/metal interfaces. Optical\nemission spectroscopy is used to determine the electron density (typ. 10 15\ncm-3) and the electron temperature (typ. 7500 K) while the role of F-anions on\nthe appearance of cathodic micro-discharges is pointed out. Plasma Electrolytic\nOxidation (PEO) is a promising plasma-assisted surface treatment of light\nmetallic alloys (e.g. Al, Mg, Ti). Although the PEO process makes it possible\nto grow oxide coatings with interesting corrosion and wear resistant\nproperties, the physical mechanisms of coating growth are not yet completely\nunderstood. Typically, the process consists in applying a high voltage\ndifference between a metallic piece and a counter-electrode which are both\nimmersed in an electrolyte bath. Compare to anodizing, the main differences\nconcern the electrolyte composition and the current and voltage ranges which\nare at least one order of magnitude higher in PEO 1. These significant\ndifferences in current and voltage imply the dielectric breakdown and\nconsequently the appearance of micro-discharges on the surface of the sample\nunder processing. Those micro-discharges are recognized as being the main\ncontributors to the formation of a dielectric porous crystalline oxide coating.\n2 Nevertheless, the breakdown mechanism that governs the appearance of those\nmicro-discharges is still under investigation. Hussein et al. 3 proposed a\nmechanism with three different plasma formation processes based on differences\nin plasma chemical composition. The results of Jovovi{\\'c} et al. 4,5\nconcerning physical properties of the plasma seem to corroborate this\nmechanism, and also point out the importance of the substrate material in the\nplasma composition. 6 Compared with DC conducted PEO process, using a bipolar\npulsed DC or AC current supply gives supplementary control latitude through the\ncurrent waveform parameters. The effect of these parameter on the\nmicro-discharges behavior has been investigated in several previous works.\n2,3,7,8 One of the main results of these studies is the absence of\nmicro-discharge during the cathodic current half-period. 9-11 Even if the\ncathodic half-period has an obvious effect on the efficiency of PEO as well as\non the coating growth and composition, the micro-plasmas appear only in anodic\nhalf-period. Sah et al. 8 have observed the cathodic breakdown of an oxide\nlayer but at very high current density (10 kA.dm-${}^2$), and after several\nsteps of sample preparation. Several models of micro-discharges appearance in\nAC current have already been proposed. 1,2,8,12,13 Though cathodic\nmicro-discharges have never been observed within usual process conditions, the\npresent study aims at defining suitable conditions to promote cathodic\nmicro-discharges and at studying the main characteristics of these\nmicro-plasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 09:50:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

The\nlong-standing problem of describing the radial weights $\\omega$ such that\n$P_\\omega$ is bounded on the Lebesgue space $L^p_\\omega$ had been known to\nexperts since decades before it was formally posed by Dostani\\'c in 2004. A\nnatural limit case of this setting is when $P_\\omega$ acts from $L^\\infty$ to\nthe Bloch space. The surjectivity of the operator becomes another relevant\nquestion in this limit case.\n  The main findings of this study are shortly listed as follows. We establish\ncharacterizations of the radial weights $\\omega$ on the unit disc such that\n$P_\\omega:L^\\infty\\to\\mathcal{B}$ is bounded and/or acts surjectively, or the\ndual of $A^1_\\omega$ is isomorphic to the Bloch space $\\mathcal{B}$ under the\n$A^2_\\omega$-pairing.

For optical pulses the manipulation and\ncharacterisation of the light polarisation state is fundamental due to its\nrelevance in several scientific and technological fields. In this work we\ndemonstrate the complete temporal reconstruction of the electric field of\nfew-cycle pulses with a complex time-dependent polarisation. Our experimental\napproach is based on extreme ultraviolet interferometry with isolated\nattosecond pulses and on the demonstration that the motion of an attosecond\nelectron wave packet is sensitive to perturbing fields only along the direction\nof its motion. By exploiting the sensitivity of interferometric techniques and\nby controlling the emission and acceleration direction of the wave packet,\npulses with energies as low as few hundreds of nanojoules can be reconstructed.\nOur approach opens the possibility to completely characterise the electric\nfield of the pulses typically used in visible pump-probe spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 11:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

While for a long time human skeletons were parameterized and fitted to\nthe observation by satisfying a reprojection error, nowadays researchers\ndirectly use neural networks to infer the 3D pose from the observations.\nHowever, most of these approaches ignore the fact that a reprojection\nconstraint has to be satisfied and are sensitive to overfitting. We tackle the\noverfitting problem by ignoring 2D to 3D correspondences. This efficiently\navoids a simple memorization of the training data and allows for a weakly\nsupervised training. One part of the proposed reprojection network (RepNet)\nlearns a mapping from a distribution of 2D poses to a distribution of 3D poses\nusing an adversarial training approach. Another part of the network estimates\nthe camera. This allows for the definition of a network layer that performs the\nreprojection of the estimated 3D pose back to 2D which results in a\nreprojection loss function. Our experiments show that RepNet generalizes well\nto unknown data and outperforms state-of-the-art methods when applied to unseen\ndata.

The characteristics of the new detector technologies have\nbeen extensively tested to prove their effectiveness with respect to the\nstate-of-the-art technology. Among these, the background rejection capability\nis crucial to determine. The signal-to-background ratio is strongly related to\nthe performance figure-of-merit for most instruments. These are designed to\nexploit the high flux expected from the new high intensity neutron sources.\nTherefore, an inadequate background rejection could significantly affect the\nmeasurements, leading to detector saturation and misleading events. This is of\nparticular importance for the kind of techniques in which the signals are\nrather weak. For the first time, the sensitivity of 3He detectors to fast\nneutrons, up to En = 10 MeV, has been estimated.

We\nshow that, in contrast with conventional spatially periodic grating, a STP\ndiffraction grating produces spatial diffraction orders, each of which is\nformed by an infinite set of temporal diffraction orders. Such spatiotemporally\nperiodic gratings are endowed with enhanced functionalities and exotic\ncharacteristics, such as asymmetric diffraction pattern, nonreciprocal and\nasymmetric transmission and reflection, and an enhanced diffraction efficiency.\nThe theory of the wave diffraction by STP gratings is formulated through\nsatisfying the conservation of both momentum and energy, and rigorous Floquet\nmode analysis. Furthermore, the theoretical analysis of the structure is\nsupported by time and frequency domain FDTD numerical simulations for both\ntransmissive and reflective STP diffraction gratings. Additionally, we provide\nthe conditions for Bragg and Raman-Nath diffraction regimes for STP gratings.\nFinally, as a particular example of a practical application of the STP\ndiffraction gratings to communication systems, we propose an original multiple\naccess communication system featuring full-duplex operation.

The\nevolution equations for the given UDE appear to correspond to a\nnon-conservative dark energy scenario, in which the total energy-momentum\ntensor is not conserved. We investigate both the background cosmology and, the\nlarge-scale imprint of the UDE by probing the angular power spectrum of galaxy\nnumber counts, on ultra-large scales; taking care to include the full\nrelativistic corrections in the observed overdensity. The background evolution\nshows that only an effective mass smaller than the Planck mass is needed in the\nearly universe in order for predictions in the given theory to match current\nobservational constraints. We found that the effective mass-evolution-rate\nparameter, which drives the evolution of the UDE, acts to enhance the observed\npower spectrum and, hence, relativistic effects (on ultra-large scales) by\nenlarging the UDE sound horizon. Conversely, both the (beyond) Horndeski\nparameter and the kineticity act to diminish the observed power spectrum, by\ndecreasing the UDE sound horizon. Our results show that, in a universe with\nUDE, a multi-tracer analysis will be needed to detect the relativistic effects\nin the large-scale structure. In the light of a multi-tracer analysis, the\nvarious relativistic effects hold the potential to distinguish different\ngravity models. Moreover, while the Doppler effect will remain significant at\nall epochs and, thus can not be ignored, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe, the\ntime-delay and the potential (difference) effects, respectively, will only\nbecome significant at epochs near z=3 and beyond, and may be neglected at late\nepochs.

To overcome these shortcomings and win the trust\nof physician, we propose a transparency guided ensemble convolutional neural\nnetwork to automatically stratify PsP and TTP on magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI).

We solve $AX=\\textbf{b}$ using the method of least squares and\nsingular value decomposition of $A$. In practical applications, such as in\nbioinformatics, the number of rows of $A$ (observations) are much less than the\nnumber of columns of $A$ (features). So we are dealing with singular matrices\nwith big condition numbers. Although it is known that the solutions of least\nsquare problems in singular case are very sensitive to perturbations in $A$,\nour novel approach in this paper is to prove that the correlations between\nfeatures can be detected by applying perturbations to $A$. The effectiveness of\nour method is verified by performing a series of comparisons with conventional\nand novel feature selection methods in the literature. It is demonstrated that\nin most situations, our method chooses considerably less number of features\nwhile attaining or exceeding the accuracy of the other methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 14:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

Most existing approaches localize object or parts in an image\nwith object or part annotations, which are expensive and labor-consuming. To\ntackle this issue, we propose a fully unsupervised part mining (UPM) approach\nto localize the discriminative parts without even image-level annotations,\nwhich largely improves the fine-grained classification performance.

Distributed\nimplementations of Kaczmarz have become, in recent years, the de facto\narchitectural choice for large-scale linear systems.

In contrast to adversarial examples,\nbackdoor or trojan attacks embed surgically modified samples with targeted\nlabels in the model training process to cause the targeted model to learn to\nmisclassify chosen samples in the presence of specific triggers, while keeping\nthe model performance stable across other nominal samples. However, current\npublished research on trojan attacks mainly focuses on classification problems,\nwhich ignores sequential dependency between inputs. In this paper, we propose\nmethods to discreetly introduce and exploit novel backdoor attacks within a\nsequential decision-making agent, such as a reinforcement learning agent, by\ntraining multiple benign and malicious policies within a single long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) network.

The 19 years of quiescence\nended in June 2015, when AG Peg exhibited a Z And-type outburst with an optical\namplitude of 1.5 magnitudes.\n  We have carried out accretion disk and WD photosphere synthetic spectral\nmodeling of a Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) spectrum obtained\non June 5.618, 2003 during the quiescence interval 12 years before the 2015\noutburst. The spectrum is heavily affected by ISM absorption as well as strong\nemission lines. We de-reddened the FUSE fluxes assuming E(B-V) = 0.10, which is\nthe maximum galactic reddening in the direction of AG Peg. We discuss our\nadoption of the pre-Gaia distance over the Gaia parallax.

This paper studies a novel\ndevice-to-device (D2D)-enabled multi-helper MEC system, in which a local user\nsolicits its nearby WDs serving as helpers for cooperative computation. We\nassume a time division multiple access (TDMA) transmission protocol, under\nwhich the local user offloads the tasks to multiple helpers and downloads the\nresults from them over orthogonal pre-scheduled time slots. Under this setup,\nwe minimize the computation latency by optimizing the local user's task\nassignment jointly with the time and rate for task offloading and results\ndownloading, as well as the computation frequency for task execution, subject\nto individual energy and computation capacity constraints at the local user and\nthe helpers. However, the formulated problem is a mixed-integer non-linear\nprogram (MINLP) that is difficult to solve. To tackle this challenge, we\npropose an efficient algorithm by first relaxing the original problem into a\nconvex one, and then constructing a suboptimal task assignment solution based\non the obtained optimal one. Next, we consider a benchmark scheme that endows\nthe WDs with their maximum computation capacities. To further reduce the\nimplementation complexity, we also develop a heuristic scheme based on the\ngreedy task assignment. Finally, numerical results validate the effectiveness\nof our proposed algorithm, as compared against the heuristic scheme and other\nbenchmark ones without either joint optimization of radio and computation\nresources or task assignment design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 15:57:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

The\ntest is readily implemented using a simulation-based, linear-time procedure.\nThe testing procedure can be customized by the practitioner using knowledge of\nthe underlying data domain. Unlike most existing test statistics, the proposed\ntest statistic is distribution-free and its exact (non-asymptotic) sampling\ndistribution is known in closed form. We establish consistency of the test\nagainst all alternatives by showing that the test statistic is distributed as a\ndiscrete uniform if and only if the samples were drawn from the candidate\ndistribution. We illustrate its efficacy for assessing the sample quality of\napproximate sampling algorithms over combinatorially large spaces with\nintractable probabilities, including random partitions in Dirichlet process\nmixture models and random lattices in Ising models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 15:45:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-18"}

Algorithms and hyperparameters must be\noptimized as a whole to produce the best performance. Typical machine learning\npipelines typically consist of complex algorithms in each of the steps. Not\nonly is the selection process combinatorial, but it is also important to\ninterpret and understand the pipelines. We propose a method to quantify the\nimportance of different layers in the pipeline, by computing an error\ncontribution relative to an agnostic choice of algorithms in that layer. We\ndemonstrate our methodology on image classification pipelines. The agnostic\nmethodology quantifies the error contributions from the computational steps,\nalgorithms and hyperparameters in the image classification pipeline. We show\nthat algorithm selection and hyper-parameter optimization methods can be used\nto quantify the error contribution and that random search is able to quantify\nthe contribution more accurately than Bayesian optimization.

Recently, the AI community has applied the Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) to learn the communication strategy and the\ncontrol policy for multiple agents. However, when implementing the\ncommunication for real-world multi-agent applications, there is a more\npractical limited-bandwidth restriction, which has been largely ignored by the\nexisting DRL-based methods. Specifically, agents trained by most previous\nmethods keep sending messages incessantly in every control cycle; due to\nemitting too many messages, these methods are unsuitable to be applied to the\nreal-world systems that have a limited bandwidth to transmit the messages. To\nhandle this problem, we propose a gating mechanism to adaptively prune\nunprofitable messages. Results show that the gating mechanism can prune more\nthan 80% messages with little damage to the performance.
