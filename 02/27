From geophysical fluids to active matter,\nacoustics or photonics, a growing family of systems presents topologically\nprotected chiral edge modes. The number of such modes should coincide with the\nbulk topological invariant (e.g. Chern number) defined for a sample without\nboundary, in agreement with the bulk-edge correspondence. However this is not\nalways the case when dealing with continuous media where there is no small\nscale cut-off. The number of edge modes actually depends on the boundary\ncondition, even when the bulk is properly regularized, showing an apparent\nparadox where the bulk-edge correspondence is violated. In this paper we solve\nthis paradox by showing that the anomaly is due to {ghost} edge modes hidden in\nthe asymptotic part of the spectrum. We provide a general formalism based on\nscattering theory to detect all edge modes properly, so that the bulk-edge\ncorrespondence is restored.

In this model, wireless nodes are represented by points in\nthe plane and there is an edge between two points if and only if their\nEuclidean distance is at most one. A hop spanner for the UDG is a spanning\nsubgraph $H$ such that for every edge $(p,q)$ in the UDG the topological\nshortest path between $p$ and $q$ in $H$ has a constant number of edges. The\nhop stretch factor of $H$ is the maximum number of edges of these paths. A hop\nspanner is plane (i.e. embedded planar) if its edges do not cross each other.\n  The problem of constructing hop spanners for the UDG has received\nconsiderable attention in both computational geometry and wireless ad hoc\nnetworks. Despite this attention, there has not been significant progress on\ngetting hop spanners that (i) are plane, and (ii) have low hop stretch factor.\nPrevious constructions either do not ensure the planarity or have high hop\nstretch factor. The only construction that satisfies both conditions is due to\nCatusse, Chepoi, and Vax\\`{e}s (2010); their plane hop spanner has hop stretch\nfactor at most 449.\n  Our main result is a simple algorithm that constructs a plane hop spanner for\nthe UDG. In addition to the simplicity, the hop stretch factor of the\nconstructed spanner is at most 341. Even though the algorithm itself is simple,\nits analysis is rather involved. Several results on the plane geometry are\nestablished in the course of the proof. These results are of independent\ninterest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 16:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

It is triggered at a particular disk location where\nthe local volume density of solids exceeds that of the gas. After their\nformation, planetesimals can grow by feeding from other planetesimals in the\nbirth ring as well as by accreting inwardly drifting pebbles from the outer\ndisk.\n  To investigate the growth of planetesimals at a single location by the\nstreaming instability, we test the conditions under which super-Earths are able\nto form within the lifetime of the gaseous disk. We modify the \\texttt{Mercury}\nN-body code to trace the growth and dynamical evolution of a swarm of\nplanetesimals at the ice line for a solar-mass star. Three distributions of\nplanetesimal sizes are investigated: (i) a mono-dispersed population of 400 km\nradius planetesimals, (ii) a poly-dispersed populations of planetesimals from\n200 km up to 1000 km, (iii) a bimodal distribution with a single runaway body\nand a swarm of smaller, 100 km size planetesimals.\n  The mono-disperse population of 400 km size planetesimals cannot form\n$\\gtrsim$ Earth mass protoplanets. Their velocity dispersions are quickly\nexcited, which suppresses both planetesimal and pebble accretion. Planets can\nform from the poly-dispersed and bimodal distributions. In these circumstances,\nthe two-component nature damps the random velocity of the large embryo by small\nplanetesimals' dynamical friction, allowing the embryo to accrete pebbles\nefficiently when it approaches $10^{-2}$ Earth mass. We find that super-Earth\nplanets are preferred to form when the pebble mass flux is higher, the disk\nturbulence is lower, or the Stokes number of the pebbles is higher.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 17:13:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

To explain this fact, we invoke\nself-organization of rupture observed in fracturing solids, both dry and fully\nsaturated, when two requirements are satisfied: i) the external drive has a\nmuch slower timescale than fracture propagation; and ii) the increment of the\nexternal load (drive) is applied only when the internal rearrangement of\nfracture is over. These requirements are needed to obtain clean Self Organised\nCriticality (SOC) in quasi-static situations. They imply that there should be\nno restriction on the fracture velocity i.e. algorithmically the fracture\nadvancement rule should always be independent of the crack velocity. Generally,\nthis is not the case when smooth answers are obtained which are often\nunphysical. Under the above conditions hints of Self Organized Criticality are\nevident in heterogeneous porous media in quasi-static conditions using a\nlattice model, showing stepwise advancement of the fracture and pressure\noscillations. We extend this model to incorporate inertia forces and show that\nthis behavior still holds.

This\nnewly outlined dynamical architecture of the distant solar system points to the\nexistence of a new planet with mass of $m_9\\sim 5-10\\,M_{\\oplus}$, residing on\na moderately inclined orbit ($i_9\\sim15-25\\deg$) with semi-major axis $a_9\\sim\n400 - 800\\,$AU and eccentricity between $e_9 \\sim 0.2 - 0.5$. This paper\nreviews the observational motivation, dynamical constraints, and prospects for\ndetection of this proposed object known as Planet Nine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 18:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

With increasing proton number beyond Z~130 the transition from\nellipsoidal-like nuclear shapes to toroidal ones takes place. The description\nof latter shapes requires the basis which is typically significantly larger\nthan the one employed for the description of ellipsoidal-like shapes. Many\nhyperheavy nuclei with toroidal shapes are expected to be unstable towards\nmultifragmentation. However, three islands of stability of spherical hyperheavy\nnuclei have been predicted for the first time in Ref. [1]. Proton and neutron\ndensities, charge radii, neutron skins and underlying shell structure of the\nnuclei located in the centers of these islands have been investigated in\ndetail.

This allows us to prove several\nproperties of simplicial fibrations which are analogous to the classical ones\nin the topological setting, for instance: all the fibers of a fibration have\nthe same strong homotopy type, a notion that has been recently introduced by\nBarmak and Minian; any fibration with a strongly collapsible base is fibrewise\ntrivial; and some other ones.

In this paper, we\nprovide three statistical estimates of the distance to ASKAP FRBs. First, we\nshow that the number of events of similar luminosity in ASKAP does not scale as\ndistance cubed, as one would expect, when directly using the observed\ndispersion measure (DM) to infer distance. Second, by comparing the average DMs\nof FRBs observed with different instruments, we estimated the average redshift\nof ASKAP FRBs to be $z\\sim 0.01$ using CHIME and ASKAP, and $z\\lesssim0.07$\nusing Parkes and ASKAP. Both values are much smaller than the upper limit\n$z\\sim0.3$ estimated directly from the DM. Third, we cross-correlate the\nlocations of the ASKAP FRBs with existing large-area redshift surveys, and see\na 3$\\sigma$ correlation with the 2MASS Redshift Survey and a 5$\\sigma$\ncorrelation with the HI Parkes All Sky Survey at $z\\sim0.007$. This corresponds\nwell with the redshift of the most likely host galaxy of ASKAP FRB 171020,\nwhich is at $z=0.00867$. These arguments combined suggest an extremely nearby\norigin of ASKAP FRBs and a local environment with accumulated electrons that\ncontribute a DM of several hundred pc/cm$^3$, which should be accounted for in\ntheoretical models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 18:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

Recent observations suggest that most\nmassive cores are subvirial (i.e., not supported by turbulence) and therefore\nare likely unstable to gravitational collapse. Here we perform radiation\nhydrodynamic simulations to follow the collapse of turbulent massive\npre-stellar cores with subvirial and virialized initial conditions to explore\nhow their dynamic state affects the formation of massive stars and core\nfragmentation into companion stars. We find that subvirial cores undergo rapid\nmonolithic collapse resulting in higher accretion rates at early times as\ncompared to the collapse of virialized cores that have the same physical\nproperties. In contrast, we find that virialized cores undergo a slower,\ngradual collapse and significant turbulent fragmentation at early times\nresulting in numerous companion stars. In the absence of strong magnetic fields\nand protostellar outflows we find that the faster growth rate of massive stars\nthat are born out of subvirial cores leads to an increase in the radiative\nheating of the core thereby further suppressing fragmentation at early times\nwhen turbulent fragmentation occurs for virialized cores.

A\nchromatic adaptation transform (CAT) is an integral part of a CAM. Its role is\nto predict \"corresponding colors,\" that is, a pair of colors that have the same\ncolor appearance when viewed under different illuminants, after partial or full\nadaptation to each illuminant. Modern CATs perform well when applied to a\nlimited range of illuminant pairs and a limited range of source (test) colors.\nHowever, they can fail if operated outside these ranges. For imaging\napplications, it is important to have a CAT that can operate on any real color\nand illuminant pair without failure. This paper proposes a new CAT that does\nnot operate on the standard von Kries model of adaptation. Instead it relies on\nspectral reconstruction and how these reconstructions behave with respect to\ndifferent illuminants. It is demonstrated that the proposed CAT is immune to\nsome of the limitations of existing CATs (such as producing colors with\nnegative tristimulus values). The proposed CAT does not use established\nempirical corresponding-color datasets to optimize performance, as most modern\nCATs do, yet it performs as well as or better than the most recent CATs when\ntested against the corresponding-color datasets. This increase in robustness\ncomes at the expense of additional complexity and computational effort. If\nrobustness is of prime importance, then the proposed method may be justifiable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 19:00:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 14:13:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 09:15:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:02:37 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 10:30:20 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 21 May 2019 12:12:41 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 12:11:12 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Sat, 28 Sep 2019 17:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

Application of symbolic dynamics to kinematic data of radial\ndistance trajectories of the hands and feet determined 16 coordination patterns\naccording to the distance of the effectors to the body center. From time series\nanalysis of occurrence and recurrence of these configurations of 25 movement\nepisodes of 14 infants both characteristics of self-organization as well as\nfeatures assumed to provide neonates with experiences involved in the\ndevelopment of body awareness were found.

We add six new black hole mass (MBH) measurements\nof nearby fast rotating early-type galaxies to the known black hole mass\nsample, namely NGC 584, NGC 2784, NGC 3640, NGC 4570, NGC 4281 and NGC 7049.\nOur target galaxies have effective velocity dispersions ({\\sigma}e) between 170\nand 245 km s^(-1), and thus this work provides additional insight into the\nblack hole properties of intermediate-mass early-type galaxies.

In this work we examine the effect of incorporating\na more realistic particle morphology on estimated radiation-pressure blowout\nsizes. To calculate the scattering and absorption cross sections of irregularly\nshaped dust grains, we use the discrete dipole approximation. These cross\nsections are necessary to calculate the $\\beta$-ratio, which determines whether\ndust grains can remain gravitationally bound to their star. We calculate\nblowout sizes for a range of stellar spectral types corresponding with stars\nknown to host debris disks. As with compact spheres, more luminous stars blow\nout larger irregularly shaped dust grains.

Further, in the United States, the six-year graduation\nrate has been 59% for decades. Improving the educational quality by training\nbetter-prepared students who can successfully graduate in a timely manner is\ncritical. Accurately predicting students' grades in future courses has\nattracted much attention as it can help identify at-risk students early so that\npersonalized feedback can be provided to them on time by advisors. Prior\nresearch on students' grade prediction include shallow linear models; however,\nstudents' learning is a highly complex process that involves the accumulation\nof knowledge across a sequence of courses that can not be sufficiently modeled\nby these linear models. In addition to that, prior approaches focus on\nprediction accuracy without considering prediction uncertainty, which is\nessential for advising and decision making. In this work, we present two types\nof Bayesian deep learning models for grade prediction. The MLP ignores the\ntemporal dynamics of students' knowledge evolution. Hence, we propose RNN for\nstudents' performance prediction. To evaluate the performance of the proposed\nmodels, we performed extensive experiments on data collected from a large\npublic university. The experimental results show that the proposed models\nachieve better performance than prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Using a\ncombination of Gaia DR2 astrometry and ground-based radial velocities, we\nexplore the hypothesis that a close encounter with another cluster member\nwithin the last 15 Myr is responsible for the present configuration of the\nsystem. Out of 461 stars analyzed, we identified two candidate perturbers that\nhad a median closest approach (CA) distance within 1 pc of HD 106906: HIP 59716\nat $D_{\\rm CA}=0.65_{-0.40}^{+0.93}$ pc ($t_{\\rm CA}=-3.49_{-1.76}^{+0.90}$\nMyr) and HIP 59721 at $D_{\\rm CA}=0.71_{-0.11}^{+0.18}$ pc ($t_{\\rm\nCA}=-2.18_{-1.04}^{+0.54}$ Myr), with the two stars likely forming a wide\nphysical binary. The trajectories of both stars relative to HD 106906 are\nalmost coplanar with the inner disk ($\\Delta\\theta = 5.4\\pm1.7$ deg and\n$4.2_{-1.1}^{+0.9}$ deg). These two stars are the best candidates of the\ncurrently known members of Sco-Cen for having a dynamically important close\nencounter with HD 106906, which may have stabilized the orbit of HD 106906 b in\nthe scenario where the planet formed in the inner system and attained high\neccentricity by interaction with the central binary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 21:02:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-28"}

These highly\nenergetic runaway electrons (MeV) play a significant role in tokamak disruption\nphysics, and therefore their accurate understanding is essential to develop\nreliable mitigation strategies. For this purpose, we have developed a fully\nimplicit solver for the 0D-2P (i.e., including two momenta coordinates)\nrelativistic nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation (rFP). As in earlier implicit rFP\nstudies (NORSE, CQL3D), electron-ion interactions are modeled using the Lorentz\noperator, and synchrotron damping using the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac reaction\nterm. However, our implementation improves on these earlier studies by 1)\nensuring exact conservation properties for electron collisions, 2) strictly\npreserving positivity, and 3) being scalable algorithmically and in parallel.\nKey to our proposed approach is an efficient multigrid preconditioner for the\nlinearized rFP equation, a multigrid elliptic solver for the Braams-Karney\npotentials [Braams and Karney, Phys.

The novel approach relies on a deep Q-network to learn the\nQ-function, and thus the optimal caching policy, in an online fashion.\nReinforcing the parent node with ability to learn-and-adapt to unknown policies\nof leaf nodes as well as spatio-temporal dynamic evolution of file requests,\nresults in remarkable caching performance, as corroborated through numerical\ntests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 01:58:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2019 00:11:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-12"}

In a three-dimensional system, a skyrmion can extend in\nthe third dimension forming a robust and flexible string structure, whose\nunique topology and symmetry are anticipated to host nontrivial functional\nresponses. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the coherent propagation of spin\nexcitations along skyrmion strings for the chiral-lattice magnet Cu2OSeO3. We\nfind that this propagation is directionally non-reciprocal, and the degree of\nnon-reciprocity, as well as the associated group velocity and decay length, are\nstrongly dependent on the character of the excitation modes. Our theoretical\ncalculation establishes the corresponding dispersion relationship, which well\nreproduces the experimentally observed features. Notably, these spin\nexcitations can propagate over a distance exceeding 10^3 times the skyrmion\ndiameter, demonstrating the excellent long-range nature of the excitation\npropagation on the skyrmion strings. Our combined experimental and theoretical\nresults offer a comprehensive account of the propagation dynamics of\nskyrmion-string excitations, and suggest the possibility of unidirectional\ninformation transfer along such topologically-protected strings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 02:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

To navigate this tradeoff, existing\nsolutions rely on complex hand-tuned heuristics, which are brittle and hard to\noptimize. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach\nto solve the packet classification problem. There are several characteristics\nthat make this problem a good fit for Deep RL. First, many of the existing\nsolutions are iteratively building a decision tree by splitting nodes in the\ntree. Second, the effects of these actions (e.g., splitting nodes) can only be\nevaluated once we are done with building the tree. These two characteristics\nare naturally captured by the ability of RL to take actions that have sparse\nand delayed rewards. Third, it is computationally efficient to generate data\ntraces and evaluate decision trees, which alleviate the notoriously high sample\ncomplexity problem of Deep RL algorithms. Our solution, NeuroCuts, uses\nsuccinct representations to encode state and action space, and efficiently\nexplore candidate decision trees to optimize for a global objective. It\nproduces compact decision trees optimized for a specific set of rules and a\ngiven performance metric, such as classification time, memory footprint, or a\ncombination of the two. Evaluation on ClassBench shows that NeuroCuts\noutperforms existing hand-crafted algorithms in classification time by 18% at\nthe median, and reduces both time and memory footprint by up to 3x.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 03:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-28"}

In a given environment, a common approach is to synthesize a\ncontroller from an abstraction or a model of the system (potentially learned\nfrom data). However, in many situations, the relationship between the dynamics\nof the model and the \\textit{actual system} is not known; and hence it is\ndifficult to provide safety guarantees for the system. In such cases, the\nStandard Simulation Metric (SSM), defined as the worst-case norm distance\nbetween the model and the system output trajectories, can be used to modify a\nreach-avoid specification for the system into a more stringent specification\nfor the abstraction. Nevertheless, the obtained distance, and hence the\nmodified specification, can be quite conservative. This limits the set of\nenvironments for which a safe controller can be obtained. We propose SPEC, a\nspecification-centric simulation metric, which overcomes these limitations by\ncomputing the distance using only the trajectories that violate the\nspecification for the system. We show that modifying a reach-avoid\nspecification with SPEC allows us to synthesize a safe controller for a larger\nset of environments compared to SSM. We also propose a probabilistic method to\ncompute SPEC for a general class of systems. Case studies using simulators for\nquadrotors and autonomous cars illustrate the advantages of the proposed metric\nfor determining safe environment sets and controllers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 03:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-28"}

It has been hypothesized that the dissipation of free energy by active\nmatter systems may be optimized to produce highly dissipative dynamical states,\nhence, leading to spontaneous emergence of more ordered states. This\ninteresting idea has not been widely tested. In particular, it is not clear\nwhether emergent states of actomyosin networks, which represent a salient\nexample of biological active matter, self-organize following the principle of\ndissipation optimization. In order to start addressing this question using\ndetailed computational modeling, we rely on the MEDYAN simulation platform,\nwhich allows simulating active matter networks from fundamental molecular\nprinciples. We have extended the capabilities of MEDYAN to allow quantification\nof the rates of dissipation resulting from chemical reactions and relaxation of\nmechanical stresses during simulation trajectories. We validate our approach\nwith a mean-field model that estimates the rates of dissipation from filament\ntreadmilling. Applying this methodology to the self-organization of small\ndisordered actomyosin networks, we find that compact and highly cross-linked\nnetworks tend to allow more efficient transduction of chemical free energy into\nmechanical energy. In these simple systems, we do not observe that spontaneous\nnetwork reorganizations lead to increases in the total dissipation rate as\npredicted by the dissipation-driven adaptation hypothesis mentioned above.\nHowever, whether such a principle operates in more general, more complex\ncytoskeletal networks remains to be investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 04:12:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

Unfortunately, the transmission range of backscatter\ncommunication is short. To facilitate backscatter communication, this work\nproposes to integrate unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with backscatter data\ncollection.

Simulation results based on a real-world\ndataset are presented to verify the theoretical results and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 05:39:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 06:15:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 19:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-08"}

This\ncelebrated phenomenon is emblematic of the special nature of randomness in\nquantum physics. The times at which the jumps occur are reputed to be\nfundamentally unpredictable. However, certain classical phenomena, like\ntsunamis, while unpredictable in the long term, may possess a degree of\npredictability in the short term, and in some cases it may be possible to\nprevent a disaster by detecting an advance warning signal. Can there be,\ndespite the indeterminism of quantum physics, a possibility to know if a\nquantum jump is about to occur or not? In this dissertation, we answer this\nquestion affirmatively by experimentally demonstrating that the completed jump\nfrom the ground to an excited state of a superconducting artificial atom can be\ntracked, as it follows its predictable \"flight,\" by monitoring the population\nof an auxiliary level coupled to the ground state. Furthermore, the\nexperimental results demonstrate that the jump when completed is continuous,\ncoherent, and deterministic. Exploiting these features, we catch and reverse a\nquantum jump mid-flight, thus deterministically preventing its completion. This\nreal-time intervention is based on a particular lull period in the population\nof the auxiliary level, which serves as our advance warning signal. Our\nresults, which agree with theoretical predictions essentially without\nadjustable parameters, support the modern quantum trajectory theory and provide\nnew ground for the exploration of real-time intervention techniques in the\ncontrol of quantum systems, such as early detection of error syndromes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 06:39:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-28"}

There are two\ncommon challenges in this task. First, the keyword bidding problem: hot ad\nkeywords are very expensive for most of the advertisers because more\nadvertisers are bidding on more popular keywords, while unpopular keywords are\ndifficult to discover. As a result, most ads have few chances to be presented\nto the users. Second, the inefficient ad impression issue: a large proportion\nof search queries, which are unpopular yet relevant to many ad keywords, have\nno ads presented on their search result pages. Existing retrieval-based or\nmatching-based methods either deteriorate the bidding competition or are unable\nto suggest novel keywords to cover more queries, which leads to inefficient ad\nimpressions. To address the above issues, this work investigates to use\ngenerative neural networks for keyword generation in sponsored search. Given a\npurchased keyword (a word sequence) as input, our model can generate a set of\nkeywords that are not only relevant to the input but also satisfy the domain\nconstraint which enforces that the domain category of a generated keyword is as\nexpected. Furthermore, a reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to\nadaptively utilize domain-specific information in keyword generation. Offline\nevaluation shows that the proposed model can generate keywords that are\ndiverse, novel, relevant to the source keyword, and accordant with the domain\nconstraint. Online evaluation shows that generative models can improve coverage\n(COV), click-through rate (CTR), and revenue per mille (RPM) substantially in\nsponsored search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 07:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-28"}

Among such penalties, we focus on the SCAD penalty. The\ncontributions of this study are three-fold: We first present a theoretical\nanalysis of a typical reconstruction performance, using the replica method,\nunder the assumption that each component of the design matrix is given as an\nindependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian variable. This\nclarifies the superiority of the SCAD estimator compared with $\\ell_1$ in a\nwide parameter range, although the nonconvex nature of the penalty tends to\nlead to solution multiplicity in certain regions. This multiplicity is shown to\nbe connected to replica symmetry breaking in the spin-glass theory. We also\nshow that the global minimum of the mean square error between the estimator and\nthe true signal is located in the replica symmetric phase. Second, we develop\nan approximate formula efficiently computing the cross-validation error without\nactually conducting the cross-validation, which is also applicable to the\nnon-i.i.d. design matrices. It is shown that this formula is only applicable to\nthe unique solution region and tends to be unstable in the multiple solution\nregion. We implement instability detection procedures, which allows the\napproximate formula to stand alone and resultantly enables us to draw phase\ndiagrams for any specific dataset. Third, we propose an annealing procedure,\ncalled nonconvexity annealing, to obtain the solution path efficiently.\nNumerical simulations are conducted on simulated datasets to examine these\nresults to verify the theoretical results consistency and the approximate\nformula efficiency.

For instance, the\ntransmission efficiency of binarization-cost 1x2 demultiplexer was -0.30 dB for\n1.31 um and -0.54 dB at 1.55 um while crosstalk at the operating wavelengths\nare negligibly small, i.e., -17.80 and -15.29 dB, respectively. Moreover, for\nthe binarization-cost 1x4 demultiplexer, the transmission efficiency values\nwere approximately -1.90 dB at 1.31, 1.39, 1.47, and 1.55 um as the crosstalk\nwas approximately -13 dB. Furthermore, the objective-first algorithm was used\nto employ our demultiplexers as multiplexers which means the ports that were\nonce used as inputs in demultiplexers are designed to be used as outputs.

Magnetic helicity is an important quantity in studies of magnetized\nplasmas as it provides a measure of the geometrical complexity of the magnetic\nfield in a given volume. A more detailed description of the spatial\ndistribution of magnetic helicity is given by the field line helicity that\nexpresses the amount of helicity associated to individual field lines, rather\nthan in the full analysed volume. Aims. Magnetic helicity is not a\ngauge-invariant quantity in general, unless it is computed with respect to a\nreference field, yielding the so called relative magnetic helicity. The field\nline helicity corresponding to the relative magnetic helicity has only been\nexamined under specific conditions so far. This work aims to define the field\nline helicity corresponding to relative magnetic helicity in the most general\nway. In addition to its general form, we provide the expression for the\nrelative magnetic field line helicity in a few commonly used gauges, and\nreproduce known results as a limit of our general formulation. Methods. By\nstarting from the definition of relative magnetic helicity, we derive the\ncorresponding field line helicity, and we note the assumptions it is based on.\nResults. We check that the developed quantity reproduces relative magnetic\nhelicity by using three different numerical simulations. For these cases we\nalso show the morphology of field line helicity in the volume, and on the\nphotospheric plane. As an application to solar situations, we compare the\nmorphology of field line helicity on the photosphere with that of the\nconnectivity-based helicity flux density in two reconstructions of an active\nregion's magnetic field. We discuss how the derived relative magnetic field\nline helicity has a wide range of applications, notably in solar physics and\nmagnetic reconnection studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 09:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

In\nCGC-QG, we design a multi-task labeling strategy to identify whether a question\nword should be copied from the input passage or be generated instead, guiding\nthe model to learn the accurate boundaries between copying and generation.\nFurthermore, our input passage encoder takes as input, among a diverse range of\nother features, the prediction made by a clue word predictor, which helps\nidentify whether each word in the input passage is a potential clue to be\ncopied into the target question. The clue word predictor is designed based on a\nnovel application of Graph Convolutional Networks onto a syntactic dependency\ntree representation of each passage, thus being able to predict clue words only\nbased on their context in the passage and their relative positions to the\nanswer in the tree. We jointly train the clue prediction as well as question\ngeneration with multi-task learning and a number of practical strategies to\nreduce the complexity.

By\ndecomposing diverse styles into the same basis, StyleRemix represents a\nspecific style in a continuous vector space with 1-dimensional coefficients.\nWith the interpretable style representation, StyleRemix not only enables the\nstyle visualization task but also allows several ways of remixing styles in the\nsmooth style embedding space.~Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of StyleRemix on various MST tasks compared to state-of-the-art\nSEL approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 10:02:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 04:47:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 02:40:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-26"}

The objective of this work was to characterize the visual dependency\nand functional dynamics of cortical activation during postural control.\nProprioceptic vibratory stimulation of calf muscles at 85 Hz was performed to\nevoke postural perturbation in open-eye (OE) and closed-eye (CE) experimental\ntrials, with pseudorandom binary stimulation phases divided into four segments\nof 16 stimuli. 64-channel EEG was recorded; with perturbation epochs defined\nusing bipolar electrodes placed proximal to each vibrator. Finally, functional\nconnectivity assessment was explored via network segregation and integration\nanalyses. Spectra variation showed waveform and vision-dependent activation\nwithin cortical regions specific to both postural adaptation and habituation.\nGeneralized spectral variation yielded significant shifts from low to high\nfrequencies in CE adaptation trials, with overall activity suppressed in\nhabituation; OE trials showed the opposite phenomenon, with both adaptation and\nhabituation yielding increases in spectral power. Finally, our analysis of\nfunctional dynamics reveals novel cortical networks implicated in postural\ncontrol using EEG source-space brain networks. In particular, our reported\nsignificant increase in local theta connectivity may signify the planning of\ncorrective steps and/or the analysis of falling consequences, while alpha band\nnetwork integration results reflect an inhibition of error detection within the\ncingulate cortex, likely due to habituation.

One way to endow the learner the\nability to perform tasks seen in the past is to store a small memory, dubbed\nepisodic memory, that stores few examples from previous tasks and then to\nreplay these examples when training for future tasks. In this work, we\nempirically analyze the effectiveness of a very small episodic memory in a CL\nsetup where each training example is only seen once. Surprisingly, across four\nrather different supervised learning benchmarks adapted to CL, a very simple\nbaseline, that jointly trains on both examples from the current task as well as\nexamples stored in the episodic memory, significantly outperforms specifically\ndesigned CL approaches with and without episodic memory.

When\nseveral vehicle variants use the same signal, it is often required to\nsimultaneously schedule such a signal in all vehicle variants. Furthermore, new\nvehicle variants are designed incrementally in such a way as to maintain\nbackward compatibility with the older vehicles.

Such efforts are particularly\nimportant to applications constrained by high-dimensional uncertain parameter\nspaces. The difficulty of accurate surrogate modeling in such systems, is\nfurther compounded by data scarcity brought about by the large cost of forward\nmodel evaluations. Traditional response surface techniques, such as Gaussian\nprocess regression (or Kriging) and polynomial chaos are difficult to scale to\nhigh dimensions. To make surrogate modeling tractable in expensive\nhigh-dimensional systems, one must resort to dimensionality reduction of the\nstochastic parameter space. A recent dimensionality reduction technique that\nhas shown great promise is the method of `active subspaces'. The classical\nformulation of active subspaces, unfortunately, requires gradient information\nfrom the forward model - often impossible to obtain. In this work, we present a\nsimple, scalable method for recovering active subspaces in high-dimensional\nstochastic systems, without gradient-information that relies on a\nreparameterization of the orthogonal active subspace projection matrix, and\ncouple this formulation with deep neural networks. We demonstrate our approach\non synthetic and real world datasets and show favorable predictive comparison\nto classical active subspaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 13:50:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 05:36:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-01"}

Here, we review to what extent crop simulation\nmodels and individual-based models are suitable to capture and predict the\nspecificities of annual crop mixtures. We argued that: 1) The crop mixture\nspatio-temporal heterogeneity (influencing the occurrence of ecological\nprocesses) determines the choice of the modeling approach (plant or crop\ncentered). 2) Only few crop models (adapted from sole crop models) and\nindividual-based models currently exist to simulate annual crop mixtures. 3)\nCrop models are mainly used to address issues related to crop mixtures\nmanagement and to the integration of crop mixtures into larger scales such as\nthe rotation, whereas individual-based models are mainly used to identify plant\ntraits involved in crop mixture performance and to quantify the relative\ncontribution of the different ecological processes (niche complementarity,\nfacilitation, competition, plasticity) to crop mixture functioning.

We see that the quantized ZBCP remains stable in presence of\nspin-flip(SF) scattering for metal-pSc junction, while it loses its stability\nwhen pSc is replaced by SOCSW. Further, the scattering matrix(S-Matrix) of the\nmetal-pSc junction satisfies BDI symmetry class regardless of SF scattering.\nFor BDI symmetry class, both Hamiltonian as well as S-Matrix satisfy\nparticle-hole(PH), time reversal(TR) and chiral symmetries. However, in case of\nmetal-SOCSW junction the Hamiltonian as well as S-Matrix belongs to symmetry\nclass D in absence of SF scattering.

Different physical conditions in the molecular clouds giving\nbirth to isolated stars and binaries are commonly invoked.

Finally, we compare our\npredictions with the observations of short-period, double-lined spectroscopic\nbinary systems. Using new analytical results, cross-validated by a direct\nintegration of the stability equations, we show that tidal instability can be\ngenerated by nonlinear couplings of inertia-gravity waves with the equilibrium\ntidal flow in short-period massive binaries, even against the Joule diffusion.\nIn the nonlinear regime, a fossil magnetic field can be dissipated by the\nturbulent magnetic diffusion induced by the saturated tidal flows.

The motivation for studying these MC systems is that they can\nrealize the concept of constructive and destructive signal superposition, which\nleads to favorable properties such as inter-symbol interference (ISI) reduction\nand avoiding environmental contamination due to continuous release of signaling\nmolecules into the channel. This work first presents a general formulation for\nbinary modulation schemes that employ two types of signaling molecules and\nproposes several modulation schemes as special cases. Moreover, two types of\nreceivers are considered: a receiver that is able to observe both types of\nsignaling molecules (2TM), and a simpler receiver that can observe only one\ntype of signaling molecules (1TM). For both of these receivers, the maximum\nlikelihood (ML) detector for general binary modulation is derived under the\nassumption that the detector has perfect knowledge of the ISI-causing sequence.\nIn addition, two suboptimal detectors of different complexity are proposed,\nnamely an ML-based detector that employs an estimate of the ISI-causing\nsequence and a detector that neglects the effect of ISI. The proposed\ndetectors, except for the detector that neglects ISI for the 2TM receiver,\nrequire knowledge of the channel response (CR) of the considered MC system.\nMoreover, the CR is needed for performance evaluation of all proposed\ndetectors. However, deriving the CR of MC systems with reactive signaling\nmolecules is challenging since the underlying partial differential equations\nthat describe the reaction-diffusion mechanism are coupled and non-linear.\nTherefore, we develop an algorithm for efficient computation of the CR and\nvalidate its accuracy via particle-based simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 10:14:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 09:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-25"}

We first demonstrate the accuracy of the new\nmulti-fidelity NN for approximating some standard benchmark functions but also\na 20-dimensional function. Subsequently, we extend the recently developed\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to be trained with multi-fidelity data\nsets (MPINNs). MPINNs contain four fully-connected neural networks, where the\nfirst one approximates the low-fidelity data, while the second and third\nconstruct the correlation between the low- and high-fidelity data and produce\nthe multi-fidelity approximation, which is then used in the last NN that\nencodes the partial differential equations (PDEs).

By optimizing this parameter,\nthe present model is capable of learning both the linear and complex nonlinear\ncorrelations between the low- and high-fidelity data adaptively. By training\nthe MPINNs, we can:(1) obtain the correlation between the low- and\nhigh-fidelity data, (2) infer the quantities of interest based on a few\nscattered data, and (3) identify the unknown parameters in the PDEs. In\nparticular, we employ the MPINNs to learn the hydraulic conductivity field for\nunsaturated flows as well as the reactive models for reactive transport.

Our results are analytically rigorous,\nempirically testable, and flexible enough to address policy-relevant scenarios.\nWe illustrate the latter by estimating the impact of recently imposed tariffs\non US imports (steel and aluminum) on specific sectors across European\ncountries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 13:02:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

On the other hand, our understanding of the\nlanguage of fake news is still minimal. Incorporating hierarchical\ndiscourse-level structure of fake and real news articles is one crucial step\ntoward a better understanding of how these articles are structured.\nNevertheless, this has rarely been investigated in the fake news detection\ndomain and faces tremendous challenges. First, existing methods for capturing\ndiscourse-level structure rely on annotated corpora which are not available for\nfake news datasets. Second, how to extract out useful information from such\ndiscovered structures is another challenge. To address these challenges, we\npropose Hierarchical Discourse-level Structure for Fake news detection. HDSF\nlearns and constructs a discourse-level structure for fake/real news articles\nin an automated and data-driven manner. Moreover, we identify insightful\nstructure-related properties, which can explain the discovered structures and\nboost our understating of fake news.

Numerous recent\npublications suggest elaborate models for biologically plausible variants of\ndeep learning, typically defining success as reaching around 98% test accuracy\non the MNIST data set. Here, we investigate how far we can go on digit (MNIST)\nand object (CIFAR10) classification with biologically plausible, local learning\nrules in a network with one hidden layer and a single readout layer. The hidden\nlayer weights are either fixed (random or random Gabor filters) or trained with\nunsupervised methods (PCA, ICA or Sparse Coding) that can be implemented by\nlocal learning rules. The readout layer is trained with a supervised, local\nlearning rule. We first implement these models with rate neurons. This\ncomparison reveals, first, that unsupervised learning does not lead to better\nperformance than fixed random projections or Gabor filters for large hidden\nlayers. Second, networks with localized receptive fields perform significantly\nbetter than networks with all-to-all connectivity and can reach backpropagation\nperformance on MNIST. We then implement two of the networks - fixed, localized,\nrandom & random Gabor filters in the hidden layer - with spiking leaky\nintegrate-and-fire neurons and spike timing dependent plasticity to train the\nreadout layer. These spiking models achieve > 98.2% test accuracy on MNIST,\nwhich is close to the performance of rate networks with one hidden layer\ntrained with backpropagation. The performance of our shallow network models is\ncomparable to most current biologically plausible models of deep learning.\nFurthermore, our results with a shallow spiking network provide an important\nreference and suggest the use of datasets other than MNIST for testing the\nperformance of future models of biologically plausible deep learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 13:16:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 15:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}
