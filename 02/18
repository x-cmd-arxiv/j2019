As an example, we study a class of one-dimensional Hamiltonians that\ndepend explicitly on time and on stochastic external parameters. The variations\nof the external parameters are responsible for a distortion of the phase space\nstructures: chaotic, weakly chaotic and regular sets change with time. We show\nthat theoretical predictions of transport rates can be made in the limit where\nthe variations of the stochastic parameters are very slow compared to the\nHamiltonian dynamics. Exact asymptotic results can be obtained in the classical\ncase where the Hamiltonian dynamics is integrable for fixed values of the\nparameters. For the more interesting chaotic Hamiltonian dynamics case, we show\nthat two mechanisms contribute to the transport.

A user intends to retrieve a subset of specific size of the inner\nproducts of the data files with minimum communication load, without revealing\nany information about the identity of the requested subset.

To prove that, we construct\nspecial dependencies among sequences of the sets of all inner products with\ndifferent length, which forms a time-homogeneous irreducible Markov chain,\nwithout affecting the marginal distribution.

In the proposed\napproach the segmentation output is a binary mask of perfusion ROI that has\nzero values for air pixels, pixels that represent non-brain tissues, and\ncerebrospinal fluid pixels. The process of binary mask producing starts with\nextracting low intensity pixels by thresholding. Optimal low-threshold value is\nsolved by obtaining intensity pixels information from the approximate\nanatomical brain location. Holes filling algorithm and binary region growing\nalgorithm are used to remove falsely detected regions and produce region of\nonly brain tissues. Further, CSF pixels extraction is provided by thresholding\nof high intensity pixels from region of only brain tissues. Each time-point\nimage of the perfusion sequence is used for adjustment of CSF pixels location.\nThe segmentation results were compared with the manual segmentation performed\nby experienced radiologists, considered as the reference standard for\nevaluation of proposed approach. On average of 120 images the segmentation\nresults have a good agreement with the reference standard. All detected\nperfusion ROIs were deemed by two experienced radiologists as satisfactory\nenough for clinical use.

Interactions\nbetween the constituent filaments in such systems are most sensitive to the\n{\\it distance of closest approach} between the central curves which approximate\ntheir configuration, subjecting these distinct assemblies to common geometric\nconstraints. In this paper, we consider two distinct notions of constant\nspacing in multi-filament packings in $\\mathbb{R}^3$: {\\it equidistance}, where\nthe distance of closest approach is constant along the length of filament\npairs; and {\\it isometry}, where the distances of closest approach between all\nneighboring filaments are constant and equal. We show that, although any smooth\ncurve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ permits one dimensional families of collinear\nequidistant curves belonging to a ruled surface, there are only two families of\ntangent fields with mutually equidistant integral curves in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The\nrelative shapes and configurations of curves in these families are highly\nconstrained: they must be either (isometric) developable domains, which can\nbend, but not twist; or (non-isometric) constant-pitch helical bundles, which\ncan twist, but not bend. Thus, simultaneously bent and twisted filament\ntextures, such as twisted toroids of condensed DNA plasmids or wire ropes, are\ndoubly frustrated: twist frustrates constant neighbor spacing in the\ncross-section, while non-equidistance requires longitudinal variations of\ninter-filament spacing. To illustrate the consequences of the failure of\nequidistance, we compare spacing in three \"almost equidistant\" ansatzes for\ntwisted toroidal bundles and use our formulation of equidistance to construct\nupper bounds on the growth of longitudinal variations of spacing with bundle\nthickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Feb 2019 21:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

In this paper, we propose the Network Dynamics (ND) model,\nwhich reconstructs a PRN0 by adding back its edges according to some recipe,\nwhile its nodes are fixed at native (PDB) locations. A PRN0 reconstruction will\neventually reconstruct its SCN0, but only after exploring several non-native\nshortcut network (SCN) configurations. It is these other SCN configurations\nthat are of interest to us, as they produce the statistics to evaluate the\ndifferent recipes. The recipes vary from each other slightly to investigate the\neffect of different edge orderings on protein folding. An edge ordering is\ndeemed more successful if it produces a stronger correlation with experimental\nfolding rates. Over proteins of different chain fold types, this basic\nrequirement is best satisfied when a recipe favours earlier restoration of\nedges with smaller sequence separation, and earlier restoration of edges\nincident on nodes with larger remaining degree within the 1-hop neighborhood of\na previously selected node. Further, this recipe generated more route-like\ntrajectories over SCN space and a wider range of simulated folding rates, both\nof which signal cooperative two-state folding behavior. It also produced better\ncorrespondence between ND calculated phi-values and experimental phi-values\nobtained from a set of ten transition state ensembles (TSE). Also introduced is\nthe local centrality measure which uses centrality of initial fold\nsubstructures to yield calculated phi-values from PRN0s with even better\noverall correspondence than ND calculated phi-values.

We consider a special class of nonlinear\nsystems with delay obtained by taking a gradient dynamical system with a\ntwo-well \"potential\" function and replacing the argument of the right-hand side\nfunction with its delayed version. This choice of the system is motivated by\nthe relative ease of its graphical interpretation, and by its relevance to a\nrecent approach to use delay in finding the global minimum of a multi-well\nfunction. Here, the simplest type of such systems is explored, for which we\nhypothesise and verify the possibility to qualitatively predict the\ndelay-induced effects, such as a chain of homoclinic bifurcations one by one\neliminating local attractors and enabling the phase trajectory to spontaneously\nvisit vicinities of all local minima. The key phenomenon here is delay-induced\nreorganisation of manifolds, which cease to serve as barriers between the local\nminima after homoclinic bifurcations. Despite the general scenario being quite\nuniversal in two-well potentials, the homoclinic bifurcation comes in various\nversions depending on the fine features of the potential.

In this paper,\nwe discuss that scalability and privacy of smart contracts can be enhanced by\nsplitting a given contract into an off-chain contract and an on-chain contract.\nSpecifically, functions of the contract that involve high-cost computation or\nsensitive information can be split and included as the off-chain contract, that\nis signed and executed by only the interested participants. The proposed\napproach allows the participants to reach unanimous agreement off-chain when\nall of them are honest, allowing computing resources of miners to be saved and\ncontent of the off-chain contract to be hidden from the public. In case of a\ndispute caused by any dishonest participants, a signed copy of the off-chain\ncontract can be revealed so that a verified instance can be created to make\nminers enforce the true execution result. Thus, honest participants have the\nability to redress and penalize any fraudulent or dishonest behavior, which\nincentivizes all participants to honestly follow the agreed off-chain contract.\nWe discuss techniques for splitting a contract into a pair of on/off-chain\ncontracts and propose a mechanism to address the challenges of handling\ndishonest participants in the system.

In one class of models (type $A$), the filaments can\ndirectly push the barrier and move it, thereby performing some work in the\nprocess. In another type of models (type $B$), the filaments wait till thermal\nfluctuations of the barrier position create enough space between the filament\ntip and the barrier, and then they grow by inserting one monomer in that gap.\nThe difference between these two types of growth seems microscopic and rather a\nmatter of modelling details.

A defining property of such an algorithm is\nthat it perturbs answers to the queries by adding zero-mean noise distributed\nwithin a bounded (possibly undisclosed) range. Other key properties of the\nalgorithm include only allowing restricted queries (enforced via an online\ninterface), suppressing answers to queries which are only satisfied by a small\ngroup of individuals (e.g., by returning a zero as an answer), and adding the\nsame perturbation to two queries which are satisfied by the same set of\nindividuals (to thwart differencing or averaging attacks).

The discussion on the characteristics of PG schemas is\nongoing in many standardization and community groups. Although some basic\naspects of a schema are already present in Neo4j 3.5, like in most commercial\ngraph databases, full support is missing allowing to constraint property graphs\nwith more or less flexibility. In this paper, we focus on two different\nperspectives from which a PG schema should be considered, as being descriptive\nor prescriptive, and we show how it would be possible to switch from one to\nanother as the application under development gains more stability. Apart from\nproposing concise schema DDL inspired by Cypher syntax, we show how schema\nvalidation can be enforced through homomorphisms between PG schemas and PG\ninstances; and how schema evolution can be described through the use of graph\nrewriting operations. Our prototypical implementation demonstrates feasibility\nand shows the need of offering high-level query primitives to accommodate\nflexible graph schema requirements as showcased in our work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 07:17:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-19"}

To advance the machine learning research in mmWave/massive MIMO,\nhowever, there is a need for a common dataset. This dataset can be used to\nevaluate the developed algorithms, reproduce the results, set benchmarks, and\ncompare the different solutions. In this work, we introduce the DeepMIMO\ndataset, which is a generic dataset for mmWave/massive MIMO channels. The\nDeepMIMO dataset generation framework has two important features. First, the\nDeepMIMO channels are constructed based on accurate ray-tracing data obtained\nfrom Remcom Wireless InSite. The DeepMIMO channels, therefore, capture the\ndependence on the environment geometry/materials and transmitter/receiver\nlocations, which is essential for several machine learning applications.\nSecond, the DeepMIMO dataset is generic/parameterized as the researcher can\nadjust a set of system and channel parameters to tailor the generated DeepMIMO\ndataset for the target machine learning application. The DeepMIMO dataset can\nthen be completely defined by the (i) the adopted ray-tracing scenario and (ii)\nthe set of parameters, which enables the accurate definition and reproduction\nof the dataset.

Water and\ncomplex organic molecules (COMs) are thought to first form on the ice mantles\nand subsequently are released into the gas phase due to star formation\nactivity. However, the critical question is whether ice mantles can survive\nstellar radiation when grains are being heated from $T_{d}\\sim 10\\rm K$ to\n$\\gtrsim 100$ K. In this paper, we first study the effect of suprathermal grain\nrotation driven by the intense radiation of young stellar objects (YSOs) on the\nice mantles. We find that the entire ice mantles can be disrupted into small\nfragments by centrifugal stress before the water ice and COMs desorb via\nthermal sublimation. We then study the consequence of resulting ice fragments\nand find that tiny fragments of radius $a \\lesssim 10$\\AA~ exhibit transient\nrelease of COMs due to thermal spikes, whereas larger fragments can facilitate\nthermal sublimation at much higher rates than from the original icy grain or\nthe same rate but with temperatures of $\\sim 20-40$ K lower. We find that\nrotational desorption is efficient for hot cores/corinos from the inner to\nouter regions where the temperature drops to $T_{\\rm gas}\\sim 40\\rm K$ and\n$n_{\\rm H}\\sim 10^{4}\\rm cm^{-3}$. We discuss the implications of this\nmechanism for desorption of COMs and water ice in various environments,\nincluding outflow cavity walls, photodissociation regions, and protoplanetary\ndisks. Finally, we show that very large aggregate grains can be disrupted into\nindividual icy grains via rotational disruption mechanism, followed by\nrotational desorption of ice mantles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 07:53:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 02:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

Recently,\nnon-parametric HSIC-based statistical tests of independence have been\nperformed. However, these tests lead to the question of the choice of the\nkernels associated to the HSIC. In particular, there is as yet no method to\nobjectively select specific kernels with theoretical guarantees in terms of\nfirst and second kind errors. One of the main contributions of this work is to\ndevelop a new HSIC-based aggregated procedure which avoids such a kernel\nchoice, and to provide theoretical guarantees for this procedure. To achieve\nthis, we first introduce non-asymptotic single tests based on Gaussian kernels\nwith a given bandwidth, which are of prescribed level $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$. From\na theoretical point of view, we upper-bound their uniform separation rate of\ntesting over Sobolev and Nikol'skii balls. Then, we aggregate several single\ntests, and obtain similar upper-bounds for the uniform separation rate of the\naggregated procedure over the same regularity spaces. Another main contribution\nis that we provide a lower-bound for the non-asymptotic minimax separation rate\nof testing over Sobolev balls, and deduce that the aggregated procedure is\nadaptive in the minimax sense over such regularity spaces.

In\naddition, the chunk-hopping mechanism allows the SAA to have only a 2.5%\nrelative CER degradation with a 320ms latency. After jointly training with a\nself-attention network language model, our SAA model obtains further error rate\nreduction on multiple datasets.

An one-level Local Projection Stabilization~(LPS), which\nis based on an enriched approximation space and a discontinuous projection\nspace, where both spaces are defined on a same mesh is used to stabilize the\nmodel equations.

In our approach,\neach trajectory is independent from the others and the quantum mixing between\ntrajectories is deduced from a variational principle.

But, one can\nexploit that for each sample in the parameter space it is known if a regulator\nwas active or not, which can be obtained from the result of the corresponding\nnumerical solution. This information can be exploited in a stochastic\ncollocation method. We approximate the function separately on each smooth\nregion by polynomial interpolation and obtain an approximation to the kink.\nNote that we do not need information about the exact location of kinks, but\nonly an indicator assigning each sample point to its smooth region. We obtain a\nglobal order of convergence of $(p+1)/d$, where $p$ is the degree of the\nemployed polynomials and $d$ the dimension of the parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 10:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-19"}

To\nvalidate the approach core samples from the reservoir with soluble rock matrix\ncomponents (salts) were tested within 100+ laboratory experiments. The\nchallenge of the experiments was to characterize the rate of salts in cores and\nalteration of porosity and permeability after reservoir desalination due to\ndrilling mud or water injection. For these three measured characteristics, we\ndeveloped the relevant predictive models, which were based on the results of\nRCA and data on coring depth and top and bottom depths of productive horizons.\nTo select the most accurate Machine Learning algorithm a comparative analysis\nhas been performed. It was shown that different algorithms work better in\ndifferent models.

In the first application scenario of multi-agent\nsystems in which direct message communication among agents is allowed, the\nmessage-dropout technique drops out the received messages from other agents in\na block-wise manner with a certain probability in the training phase and\ncompensates for this effect by multiplying the weights of the dropped-out block\nunits with a correction probability. The applied message-dropout technique\neffectively handles the increased input dimension in multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning with communication and makes learning robust against communication\nerrors in the execution phase. In the second application scenario of\ncentralized training with decentralized execution, we particularly consider the\napplication of the proposed message-dropout to Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic\nPolicy Gradient (MADDPG), which uses a centralized critic to train a\ndecentralized actor for each agent.

To\nthis end, polyenes are modelled as sets of weakly interacting formally-double\nbonds, where the single bonds represent the interaction between the former and\nare treated as a perturbation. Mathematically, the above-formulated goal is\nrealized by means of a particular version of the non-canonical method of\nmolecular orbitals (MOs) based on the Brillouin theorem and yielding the\nexpressions both for total energies and for non-canonical (localized) MOs\n(NCMOs) directly without any reference to usual (canonical) MOs.

Moreover, a local\nrelation follows between constitution of the nearest environment of a certain\nbond, delocalization pattern of the respective pair of electrons and\ncontribution of just this pair to the total CE of the given polyene.

This work builds STRong\nIntentional Perturbation (STRIP) based run-time trojan attack detection system\nand focuses on vision system. We intentionally perturb the incoming input, for\ninstance by superimposing various image patterns, and observe the randomness of\npredicted classes for perturbed inputs from a given deployed model---malicious\nor benign. A low entropy in predicted classes violates the input-dependence\nproperty of a benign model and implies the presence of a malicious input---a\ncharacteristic of a trojaned input. The high efficacy of our method is\nvalidated through case studies on three popular and contrasting datasets:\nMNIST, CIFAR10 and GTSRB. We achieve an overall false acceptance rate (FAR) of\nless than 1%, given a preset false rejection rate (FRR) of 1%, for different\ntypes of triggers. Using CIFAR10 and GTSRB, we have empirically achieved result\nof 0% for both FRR and FAR. We have also evaluated STRIP robustness against a\nnumber of trojan attack variants and adaptive attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 11:49:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 03:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-20"}

Because of the\nweak memory model of C/C++, libraries may suffer from vulnerabilities which can\nexpose the applications to potential attacks. For example, a very large number\nof return oriented programming gadgets exist in glibc that allow stitching\ntogether semantically valid but malicious Turing-complete programs. In spite of\nsignificant advances in attack detection and mitigation, full defense is\nunrealistic against an ever-growing set of possibilities for generating such\nmalicious programs.\n  In this work, we create a defense mechanism by debloating libraries to reduce\nthe dynamic functions linked so that the possibilities of constructing\nmalicious programs diminishes significantly. The key idea is to locate each\nlibrary call site within an application, and in each case to load only the set\nof library functions that will be used at that call site. This approach of\ndemand-driven loading relies on an input-aware oracle that predicts a\nnear-exact set of library functions needed at a given call site during the\nexecution. The predicted functions are loaded just in time, and the complete\ncall chain (of function bodies) inside the library is purged after returning\nfrom the library call back into the application. We present a decision-tree\nbased predictor, which acts as an oracle, and an optimized runtime system,\nwhich works directly with library binaries like GNU libc and libstdc++. We show\nthat on average, the proposed scheme cuts the exposed code surface of libraries\nby 97.2%, reduces ROP gadgets present in linked libraries by 97.9%, achieves a\nprediction accuracy in most cases of at least 97%, and adds a small runtime\noverhead of 18% on all libraries (16% for glibc, 2% for others) across all\nbenchmarks of SPEC 2006, suggesting this scheme is practical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 13:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-19"}

In the description of the ground state and the Hoyle\nstate of $^{12}$C in the resonating group method or the generator coordinate\nmethod, a superposition of the orientations of Wheeler's triangular cluster on\nthe cluster plane would naturally generate an intrinsic toroidal density. A\ntoroidal state also has a probability amplitude to overlap with a 3-alpha\ncluster, which is the dominant decay mode for the Hoyle state. For these\nreasons, we study a toroidal description of the states of $^{12}$C in the\ntoroidal configuration both phenomenologically and microscopically. A toroidal\n$^{12}$C nucleus distinguishes itself by toroidal particle-hole multiplet\nexcitations between one toroidal single-particle shell to another. From such a\nsignature and experimental data, we find phenomenologically that the Hoyle\nstate and many of its higher excited states may be tentatively attributed to\nthose of the $^{12}$C nucleus in a toroidal configuration. We then study the\n$^{12}$C system from a microscopic mean-field approximation using variational\nwave functions. We find that the equidensity surfaces of the $^{12}$C ground\nstate exhibit a dense toroidal core immersed in lower-density oblate spheroids\nin the surface region. Furthermore, there are prominent toroidal features of\nthe equidensity surfaces for the state at the Hoyle excitation energy, at which\nprevious cluster model calculations indicate the presence of a 3-alpha cluster\nstate.

On the one hand, because individuals in similar\nfield positions are also imposed with similar cultural orientations, cultural\nhomophily reproduces objective field structure in intersubjective social\nnetwork ties. On the other hand, fields are operative in practice and to\naccomplish pragmatic goals individuals who occupy different field positions\noften join in groups, creatively reinterpret the field-imposed cultural\norientations, and produce cultural similarities alternative to the\nposition-specific ones. Drawing on these emergent similarities, the cultural\nhomophily mechanism might stimulate social network ties between members who\noccupy not the same but different field positions, thus contesting fields. I\nexamine this ambivalent role of cultural homophily in two creative collectives,\neach embracing members positioned closer to the opposite poles of the field of\ncultural production.

The effect of adding $U$ is manifested in both materials as\nthe change of band structure in response to the change of orbital occupancies\nof electrons, i.e., the soft band effect. This effect brings about competitions\nof electrons between different orbitals and gives rise to multiple metastable\nstates.\n  In the second part, we go beyond band theory and study how we can use the\ndensity matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method based on matrix product\nstates (MPS) to perform real-time evolutions of the Anderson impurity model,\ntowards the goal of building a real-time impurity solver for the nonequilibrium\ndynamical mean-field theory (DMFT).

This concept could be considered analogous to\nthe effect of hyperfine interaction (HFI). In order to investigate this model,\nFe3O4 MNPs are used as a dopant for generating random hyperfine-like magnetic\nfields in a HFI-dominant {\\pi}-conjugated polymer host,\npoly(2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (MeH-PPV). The\nmagnetoconductance (MC) response in organic light emitting diodes made by\nMeH-PPV/MNP blends is used to estimate the effective hyperfine field in the\nblends. Firstly, we find that the shape of the MC response essentially remains\nthe same regardless of the MNP concentration, which is attributed to the\nsimilar functionality between the nuclear spins and the MNPs. Secondly, the\nwidth of MC increases with increasing MNP concentration. Magneto-optical Kerr\neffect experiments and micromagnetic simulation indicate that the additional\nincrease of the MC width is associated with the strength of the magnetization\nof the blend. Finally, the MC broadening has the same temperature dependent\ntrend as the magnetization of the MNPs where the unique effect of the MNPs in\ntheir superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic regimes on the MC response is\nobserved.

We exploit both the\nreceived pilots and the received data signals for uplink channel estimation. We\nshow analytically that when the number of transmit antennas and the length of\nthe data vector both tend to infinity, the signals of the desired user and the\neavesdropper lie in different eigenspaces of the received signal matrix at the\nbase station provided that their signal powers are different. This finding\nreveals that decreasing (instead of increasing) the desired user's signal power\nmight be an effective approach to combat a strong active attack from an\neavesdropper.

The VB-based positioning system works by setting a VB\npoint on the railway track and determining the passage of the VB point using\nthe position solution from the GNSS receiver. Although augmentation systems\nsuch as SBAS or GBAS are able to satisfy the integrity requirements of the\naviation standards down to the 10-7 level, it is difficult to satisfy the high\nintegrity requirements of the railway sector because firstly the railway users\nlocated on the ground are affected by the ground environment such as terrain,\nbuildings and tunnels and secondly because the stringency of the railway sector\nrequirements extends below the 10-9 level. This paper proposes a method to\ndetect faults in the GNSS solution due to satellite failure or local effects.\nFirstly, requirements for the monitoring performance are carefully derived\naccounting for the specificities of GNSS, namely that the possibility of\nconsecutive VB faults cannot be discounted. The second contribution of the\npaper is the proposed detection using both odometry and track geometry of the\nonboard system. This enables to monitor all three-dimensional solution error so\nthat higher sensitivity for the fault detection can be achieved. Simulations\nhave been performed with both single and dual (GPS, GALILEO) solutions. It has\nbeen found that the combinations of metrics are able to achieve very small\nmissed detection probabilities for mean failure rates from 5.0m/s down to\n0.03m/s for most dual constellation geometries. The detection performance of\nthe odometer implementation varied according to the heading of the train. On\nthe other hand, when odometry and track geometry are used together, all the\nthree-directional monitors can obtain stable results regardless of the heading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Feb 2019 19:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

Recently,\nneural networks have attracted attention as a data-driven map representation,\nand have shown promising results in visual localization. However, these neural\nnetwork maps are generally hard to interpret by human. A readable map is not\nonly accessible to humans, but also provides a way to be verified when the\nground truth pose is unavailable. To tackle this problem, we propose Generative\nMap, a new framework for learning human-readable neural network maps, by\ncombining a generative model with the Kalman filter, which also allows it to\nincorporate additional sensor information such as stereo visual odometry. For\nevaluation, we use real world images from the 7-Scenes and Oxford RobotCar\ndatasets. We demonstrate that our Generative Map can be queried with a pose of\ninterest from the test sequence to predict an image, which closely resembles\nthe true scene. For localization, we show that Generative Map achieves\ncomparable performance with current regression models. Moreover, our framework\nis trained completely from scratch, unlike regression models which rely on\nlarge ImageNet pretrained networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 13:18:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 13:13:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 11:08:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 15:59:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}
