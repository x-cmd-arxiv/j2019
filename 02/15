But this phenomenon is difficult to\nreconcile with quantum mechanics. One of the main goals in the field of quantum\nchaos is to establish a correspondence between the dynamics of classical\nchaotic systems and their quantum counterparts. In isolated systems in the\nabsence of decoherence, there is such a correspondence in dynamics, but it\nusually persists only over a short time window, after which quantum\ninterference washes out classical chaos. We demonstrate that quantum mechanics\ncan also play the opposite role and generate exponential instabilities in\nclassically non-chaotic systems within this early-time window. Our calculations\nemploy the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) -- a diagnostic that reduces\nto the Lyapunov exponent in the classical limit, but is well defined for\ngeneral quantum systems. Specifically, we show that a variety of classically\nnon-chaotic models, such as polygonal billiards, whose classical Lyapunov\nexponents are always zero, demonstrate a Lyapunov-like exponential growth of\nthe OTOC at early times with Planck's-constant-dependent rates. This behavior\nis sharply contrasted with the slow early-time growth of the analog of the OTOC\nin the systems' classical counterparts.

This paper provides both experimental and analytical investigation of\nmicro unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) detection in a rocky terrain using a low\ngrazing angle, surface-sited 24 GHz dual polarized frequency modulated\ncontinuous wave (FMCW) radar. The radar backscatter signal from the UAV is\npolluted by land clutters which is modeled using a uniform Weibull\ndistribution. A constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector which employs\nadaptive thresholding is designed to detect the UAV in the rich clutter\nbackground. In order to further enhance the discrimination of the UAV from the\nclutter, the micro-Doppler signature of the rotating propellers and bulk\ntrajectory of the UAV are extracted and plotted in the time-frequency domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 16:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-15"}

Most\nstate-of-the-art works train action classifiers on video segments\npre-determined by action proposal. However, recent work found that a desirable\nmodel should move beyond segment-level and make dense predictions at a fine\ngranularity in time to determine precise temporal boundaries.

Spatial CNNs are responsible for abstracting semantics in\nspatial dimension while temporal CNN is responsible for introducing temporal\ncontext information and performing dense predictions. The proposed FSN can make\ndense predictions at frame-level for a video clip using both spatial and\ntemporal context information. FSN is trained in an end-to-end manner, so the\nmodel can be optimized in spatial and temporal domain jointly.

A quintessential example of SOI-induced\ntransport is the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), first observed in 1880, in which\nan electric current perpendicular to the magnetization in a magnetic film\ngenerates charge accumulation on the surfaces. Here we report the observation\nof a counterpart of the AHE that we term the anomalous spin-orbit torque\n(ASOT), wherein an electric current parallel to the magnetization generates\nopposite spin-orbit torques on the surfaces of the magnetic film.

Similar\neffects are also observed in other common ferromagnetic metals, including Co,\nNi, and Fe. First principles calculations corroborate the order of magnitude of\nthe measured values.

Having confirmed their\ndetectability, it is now important to carry out systematic searches for them in\norder to establish their frequency, and in turn learn about the statistical\nproperties of high-redshift stars and of the granularity of matter in the\nforeground deflector. Here we report the discovery of a highly magnified star\nat redshift $z = 0.94$ in a strongly lensed arc behind a Hubble Frontier Field\ngalaxy cluster, MACS J0416.1-2403, discovered as part of a systematic archival\nsearch. The bright transient (dubbed \"Warhol\") was discovered in Hubble Space\nTelescope data taken on 2014 September 15 and 16. This single image faded over\na period of two weeks, and observations taken on 2014 September 1 show that the\nduration of the microlensing event was at most four weeks in total. The light\ncurve may also exhibit slow changes over a period of years consistent with the\nlevel of microlensing expected from stars responsible for the intracluster\nlight (ICL) of the cluster. Optical and infrared observations taken near peak\nbrightness can be fit by a stellar spectrum with moderate host-galaxy\nextinction. A blue supergiant matches the measured spectral energy distribution\nnear peak, implying a temporary magnification of at least several thousand.\nWhile the spectrum of an O-type star would also fit the transient's spectral\nenergy distribution, extremely luminous O-type stars are much less common than\nblue supergiants. The short timescale of the event and the estimated effective\ntemperature indicate that the lensed source is an extremely magnified star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 17:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

The project intends to examine the\nvalidity of this paradigm by measuring the radio continuum on the same physical\nscale as the accretion disks, to investigate any possible connection between\nthese disks and the radio continuum. We observed a sample of 18 LLAGNs in the\n4.8 GHz (6 cm) radio continuum using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) with\n3.3 to 6.5 milliarcseconds resolution.

Among the four sources the misalignment of the radio\ncontinuum with respect to the normal vector to the maser disk is smaller when\nthe inner radius of the maser disk is larger. Furthermore, a correlation is\nobserved between the 5 GHz VLBA radio continuum and the [OIII] luminosity and\nalso with the H$_{2}$O maser disk's inner radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 18:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

Each\nprimitive agent consists of a limb with a motor attached at one end. Limbs may\nchoose to link up to form collectives. When a limb initiates a link-up action,\nand there is another limb nearby, the latter is magnetically connected to the\n'parent' limb's motor. This forms a new single agent, which may further link\nwith other agents. In this way, complex morphologies can emerge, controlled by\na policy whose architecture is in explicit correspondence with the morphology.\nWe evaluate the performance of these dynamic and modular agents in simulated\nenvironments.

The unprecedented resolution of\nTNG50 enables us to model galaxies with sub-kpc half-light radii and with\n<300-pc disk heights. Coupled with the large-volume statistics, we characterize\na diverse, redshift- and mass-dependent structural and kinematical\nmorphological mix of galaxies all the way to early epochs. Our model predicts\nthat for star-forming galaxies the fraction of disk-like morphologies, based on\n3D stellar shapes, increases with both cosmic time and galaxy stellar mass. Gas\nkinematics reveal that the vast majority of 10^9-11.5 Msun star-forming\ngalaxies are rotationally-supported disks for most cosmic epochs\n(Vmax/sigma>2-3, z<5), being dynamically hotter at earlier epochs (z>1.5).\nDespite large velocity dispersion at high redshift, cold and dense gas in\ngalaxies predominantly arranges in disky or elongated shapes at all times and\nmasses; these gaseous components exhibit rotationally-dominated motions far\nexceeding the collisionless stellar bodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 16:46:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Since\nthe M1 excitation occurs mainly for open-shell nuclei, the nuclear pairing\neffect is expected to play a role. As expected from the form of operator, this\nmode may provide the information on the spin-related properties, including the\nspin component of dineutron and diproton correlations. In general, the sum rule\nfor M1 transition strength has not been derived yet. Purpose: To investigate\nthe M1 excitation of the systems with two valence nucleons above the\nclosed-shell core, with pairing correlation included, and to establish the M1\nsum rule that could be used to validate theoretical and experimental\napproaches. Possibility to utilize the M1 excitation as a tool to investigate\nthe pairing correlation in medium is also discussed. Method: Three-body model,\nwhich consists of a rigid spherical core and two valence nucleons, is employed.\nInteractions for its two-body subsystems are phenomenologically determined in\norder to reproduce the two-body and three-body energies. We also derive the M1\nsum rule within this three-body picture. Conclusion: The introduced M1 sum rule\ncan be utilized as a benchmark for model calculations of M1 transitions in the\nsystems with two valence nucleons. The total sum of the M1 transition strength\nis related with the coupled spin of valence nucleons in the open shell, where\nthe pairing correlation is unnegligible. The three-body-model calculations for\n18 O, 18 Ne, and 42 Ca nuclei demonstrate a significant effect of the pairing\ncorrelations on the low-lying M1 transitions.

A variety of attack strategies\nhave been proposed to craft these samples; however, there is no standard model\nthat is used to compare the success of each type of attack. Furthermore, there\nis no literature currently available that evaluates how common hyperparameters\nand optimization strategies may impact a model's ability to resist these\nsamples. This research bridges that lack of awareness and provides a means for\nthe selection of training and model parameters in future research on evasion\nattacks against convolutional neural networks.

Computing the error probability directly requires complete knowledge\nand diagonalization of the density matrices describing these states. Both of\nthese fundamental requirements become impractically difficult to obtain as the\ndimension of the states grow large. In this article, we analyze quantum\nillumination as a quantum channel discrimination protocol and circumvent these\nissues by using the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt inner product as a measure of\ndistinguishability. Using this measure, we show that the greatest advantage\ngained by quantum illumination over conventional illumination occurs when one\nuses a Bell state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 20:11:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 14:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

Lifted model checking for a variability model is\ncapable of verifying all its variants simultaneously in a single run by\nexploiting the similarities between the variants. The computational cost of\nlifted model checking still greatly depends on the number of variants (the size\nof configuration space), which is often huge.\n  One of the most promising approaches to fighting the configuration space\nexplosion problem in lifted model checking are variability abstractions. In\nthis work, we define a novel game-based approach for variability-specific\nabstraction and refinement for lifted model checking of the full CTL,\ninterpreted over 3-valued semantics. We propose a direct algorithm for solving\na 3-valued (abstract) lifted model checking game. In case the result of model\nchecking an abstract variability model is indefinite, we suggest a new notion\nof refinement, which eliminates indefinite results. This provides an iterative\nincremental variability-specific abstraction and refinement framework, where\nrefinement is applied only where indefinite results exist and definite results\nfrom previous iterations are reused.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 20:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}

Our model translates\nthe satellite image to the corresponding standard layer map image using three\nmain model architectures: (i) a conditional Generative Adversarial Network\n(GAN) which compresses the images down to a learned embedding, (ii) a generator\nwhich is trained as a normalizing flow (RealNVP) model, and (iii) a conditional\nGAN where the generator translates via a series of convolutions to the standard\nlayer of a map and the discriminator input is the concatenation of the\nreal/generated map and the satellite image. Model (iii) was by far the most\npromising of three models. To improve the results we also added a\nreconstruction loss and style transfer loss in addition to the GAN losses. The\nthird model architecture produced the best quality of sampled images.

As expected, at fixed stellar mass and\nellipticity, satellites have lower star formation rate (SFR) and spin than the\ncontrol centrals.

Integrating expert\nknowledge into the network has three key advantages: (a) Reduction in the\namount of data needed to train the model, (b) provision of a lower bound on the\nperformance of the resulting classifier by obtaining the best of both worlds,\nand (c) improved convergence of model parameters (model converges in smaller\nnumber of epochs).

Therefore, KINN employs a novel residual knowledge incorporation scheme,\nwhich can automatically determine the quality of the predictions made by the\nexpert and rectify it accordingly by learning the trends/patterns from data.\nSpecifically, the method tries to use information contained in one modality to\ncomplement information missed by the other. We evaluated KINN on a real world\ntraffic flow prediction problem. KINN significantly superseded performance of\nboth the expert and as well as the base network (LSTM in this case) when\nevaluated in isolation, highlighting its superiority for the task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 00:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}

A micro-PL and Raman system is used to obtain\nspatially resolved images of the differently doped transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs). The domain inverted lithium niobate causes changes in\nthe TMDs due to electrostatic doping as a result of the remnant polarization\nfrom the substrate. Moreover, the differently doped TMDs (n-type MoSe2 and\np-type WSe2) exhibit opposite PL modulation. Distinct oppositely charged\ndomains were obtained with a 9-fold PL enhancement for the same single MoSe2\nsheet when adhered to the positive (P+) and negative (P-) domains. This sharp\nPL modulation on the ferroelectric domain results from different free electron\nor hole concentrations in the materials conduction band or valence band.\nMoreover, excitons dissociate rapidly at the interface between the P+ and P-\ndomains due to the built-in electric field.

One of the well-known stable mechanisms\nis the man-oriented Gale-Shapley algorithm (MGS). MGS has a good property that\nit is strategy-proof to the men's side, i.e., no man can obtain a better\noutcome by falsifying a preference list. We call such a mechanism a\nman-strategy-proof mechanism. Unfortunately, MGS is not a woman-strategy-proof\nmechanism. Roth has shown that there is no stable mechanism that is\nsimultaneously man-strategy-proof and woman-strategy-proof, which is known as\nRoth's impossibility theorem.\n  In this paper, we extend these results to the stable marriage problem with\nties and incomplete lists (SMTI). Since SMTI is an extension of SM, Roth's\nimpossibility theorem takes over to SMTI. Therefore, we focus on the\none-sided-strategy-proofness. In SMTI, one instance can have stable matchings\nof different sizes, and it is natural to consider the problem of finding a\nlargest stable matching, known as MAX SMTI. Thus we incorporate the notion of\napproximation ratio used in the theory of approximation algorithms. We say that\na stable-mechanism is $c$-approximate-stable mechanism if it always returns a\nstable matching of size at least $1/c$ of a largest one. We also consider a\nrestricted variant of MAX SMTI, which we call MAX SMTI-1TM, where only men's\nlists can contain ties.\n  Our results are summarized as follows: (i) MAX SMTI admits both a\nman-strategy-proof 2-approximate-stable mechanism and a woman-strategy-proof\n2-approximate-stable mechanism. (ii) MAX SMTI-1TM admits a woman-strategy-proof\n2-approximate-stable mechanism. (iii) MAX SMTI-1TM admits a man-strategy-proof\n1.5-approximate-stable mechanism. All these results are tight in terms of\napproximation ratios. Also, all these strategy-proofness results apply for\nstrategy-proofness against coalitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}

Recent network quantization techniques quantize each weight\nkernel in a convolutional layer independently for higher inference accuracy,\nsince the weight kernels in a layer exhibit different variances and hence have\ndifferent amounts of redundancy. The quantization bitwidth or bit number (QBN)\ndirectly decides the inference accuracy, latency, energy and hardware overhead.\nTo effectively reduce the redundancy and accelerate CNN inferences, various\nweight kernels should be quantized with different QBNs. However, prior works\nuse only one QBN to quantize each convolutional layer or the entire CNN,\nbecause the design space of searching a QBN for each weight kernel is too\nlarge. The hand-crafted heuristic of the kernel-wise QBN search is so\nsophisticated that domain experts can obtain only sub-optimal results.

In this paper, we propose a\nhierarchical-DRL-based kernel-wise network quantization technique, AutoQ, to\nautomatically search a QBN for each weight kernel, and choose another QBN for\neach activation layer. Compared to the models quantized by the state-of-the-art\nDRL-based schemes, on average, the same models quantized by AutoQ reduce the\ninference latency by 54.06\\%, and decrease the inference energy consumption by\n50.69\\%, while achieving the same inference accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 05:28:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 03:46:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 22:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

In this paper, we study the earliest phases of star formation with a\nseries of high-resolution numerical simulations that include the formation of\nsinks. In particular, we focus on the transition from cores to sinks within a\nmassive molecular filament. We compare the CMF and IMF between magnetized and\nunmagnetized simulations, and between different resolutions. We find that\nselecting cores based on their kinematic virial parameter excludes collapsing\nobjects because they host large velocity dispersions. Selecting only the\nthermally unstable magnetized cores, we observe that their mass-to-flux ratio\nspans almost two orders of magnitude for a given mass. We also see that, when\nmagnetic fields are included, the CMF peaks at higher core mass values with\nrespect to pure hydrodynamical simulations. Nonetheless, all models produce\nsink mass functions with a high-mass slope consistent with Salpeter. Finally,\nwe examine the effects of resolution and find that, in isothermal simulations,\neven models with very high dynamical range fail to converge in the mass\nfunction. Our main conclusion is that, although the resulting CMFs and IMFs\nhave similar slopes in all simulations, the cores have slightly different sizes\nand kinematical properties when a magnetic field is included. However, a core\nselection based on the mass-to-flux ratio alone is not enough to alter the\nshape of the CMF, if we do not take thermal stability into account. Finally, we\nconclude that extreme care should be given to resolution issues when studying\nsink formation with an isothermal equation of state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 09:56:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

Although burst buffer can improve I/O performance in\nmany cases, we find that it has some limitations such as requiring large SSD\ncapacity and harmonious overlapping between computation phase and data flushing\nphase. In this paper, we propose a scheme, called SSDUP+1. SSDUP+ aims to\nimprove the burst buffer by addressing the above limitations. First, in order\nto reduce the demand for the SSD capacity, we develop a novel method to detect\nand quantify the data randomness in the write traffic. Further, an adaptive\nalgorithm is proposed to classify the random writes dynamically. By doing so,\nmuch less SSD capacity is required to achieve the similar performance as other\nburst buffer schemes. Next, in order to overcome the difficulty of perfectly\noverlapping the computation phase and the flushing phase, we propose a pipeline\nmechanism for the SSD buffer, in which data buffering and flushing are\nperformed in pipeline. In addition, in order to improve the I/O throughput, we\nadopt a traffic-aware flushing strategy to reduce the I/O interference in HDD.\nFinally, in order to further improve the performance of buffering random writes\nin SSD, SSDUP+ transforms the random writes to sequential writes in SSD by\nstoring the data with a log structure. Further, SSDUP+ uses the AVL tree\nstructure to store the sequence information of the data. We have implemented a\nprototype of SSDUP+ based on OrangeFS and conducted extensive experiments. The\nexperimental results show that our proposed SSDUP+ can save an average of 50%\nSSD space, while delivering almost the same performance as other common burst\nbuffer schemes. In addition, SSDUP+ can save about 20% SSD space compared with\nthe previous version of this work, SSDUP, while achieving 20%-30% higher I/O\nthroughput than SSDUP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 10:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}

The material used in\nthe present investigation is an off-stoichiometric alloy of nominal\ncomposition, Ni[2.04]Mn[1.4]Sn[0.56]. This prototypical alloy, similar to other\nmembers in the Ni-Mn-Sn series, orders ferromagnetically below T[CA] (= 320 K),\nand undergoes martensitic type structural transition at T[MS] (= 290 K), which\nis associated with the sudden loss of magnetization. The sample regains its\nmagnetization below another magnetic transition at T[CM] = 260 K. Eventually,\nthe composition shows a step-like anomaly at T[B] = 120 K, which is found to\ncoincide with the blocking temperature of exchange bias effect observed in the\nalloy. In our study, the initial asymmetry A_[10] ) of the $\\mu$SR data falls\nrapidly below T[CA], indicating the onset of bulk magnetic order. A[10] regains\nits full asymmetry value below T[MS] suggesting the collapse of the\nferromagnetic order into a fully disordered paramagnetic state. Below the\nsecond magnetic transition at T[CM], asymmetry drops again, confirming the\nre-entrance of a long range ordered state. Interestingly, A[10] increases\nsluggishly below T[B], indicating that the system attains a disordered/glassy\nmagnetic phase below T[B], which is responsible for the exchange bias and\nfrequency dispersion in the ac susceptibility data as previously reported. The\nneutron powder diffraction data do not show any magnetic superlattice\nreflections, ruling out the possibility of a long range antiferromagnetic state\nat low temperatures. The ground state is likely to be comprised of a\nconcentrated metallic spin-glass in the backdrop of an ordered ferromagnetic\nstate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 10:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

In a quiescent flow, two nearby\nvesicles move slowly towards each other under the adhesive potential, pushing\nout fluid between them to form a vesicle doublet at equilibrium. A lubrication\nanalysis on such draining of a thin film gives the dependencies of draining\ntime on adhesion strength and separation distance that are in good agreement\nwith numerical results.

In image-based methods, where motion is indirectly\nestimated by reconstructing and co-registering images, a trade off between\nspatial and temporal resolution of the motion-fields has to be made due to the\nimage reconstruction step. However, we observe that motion-fields are very\ncompressible due to the spatial correlation of internal body motion. Therefore,\nreconstructing only motion-fields directly from surrogate signals or k-space\ndata without the need for image reconstruction should require few data, and\ncould eventually result in high spatio-temporal resolution motion-fields. In\nthis work we introduce MR-MOTUS, a framework that makes exactly this possible.\nThe two main innovations of this work are (1) a signal model that explicitly\nrelates the k-space signal of a deforming object to general non-rigid\nmotion-fields, and (2) model-based reconstruction of motion-fields directly\nfrom highly undersampled k-space data by solving the corresponding inverse\nproblem.

The measurement of the secular energy transfer from the parallel\nelectric field as a function of electron velocity shows a signature consistent\nwith Landau damping.

The studies reveal\nthat the intersecting angle between two of those lines is closely related to\nthe vanishing order of the eigenfunction at the intersecting point.

Roughly speaking, the vanishing order is generically infinite if\nthe intersecting angle is {\\it irrational}, and the vanishing order is finite\nif the intersecting angle is rational.

Moreover, they are\napplied directly to some physical problems of great importance, including the\ninverse obstacle scattering problem and the inverse diffraction grating\nproblem. It is shown in a certain polygonal setup that one can recover the\nsupport of the unknown scatterer as well as the surface impedance parameter by\nfinitely many far-field patterns. Indeed, at most two far-field patterns are\nsufficient for some important applications. Unique identifiability by finitely\nmany far-field patterns remains to be a highly challenging fundamental\nmathematical problem in the inverse scattering theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 12:56:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 09:21:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 14:25:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2019 02:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

Though\nsimilar to the existing approaches deriving electromagnetism from special\nrelativity, the present one extends a long way towards the derivation of\nMaxwell's equations with minimal physical assumptions. In particular, without\npostulating Coulomb's law, homogeneous Maxwell's equations are written down by\nfollowing a route different from the standard one, i.e. first introducing\nelectromagnetic potentials in order to write down a relativistic invariant\naction, which is just the inverse approach to the usual one. Also, Feynman's\nderivation of the Lorentz force exclusively follows from its linearity in the\ncharge velocity and from relativistic invariance. Going further, i.e. adding\nthe inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations, requires some more physical input, and\ncan be done by just following conventional lines, hence this task was not\npursued here.

Here, we study the effects of decoherence on\nthe diabatic errors in the braiding process for a set of time-dependent\nHamiltonians with finite smoothness. To this end, we employ the master equation\nto calculate the diabatic excitation population for three kinds of decoherence\nprocesses. (1) Only pure dehasing: the scaling of the excitation population\nchanged from $T^{-2k-2}$ to $T^{-1}$ ($k$ is the number of the Hamiltonian's\ntime derivatives vanishing at the initial and final times) as the braiding\nduration $T$ exceeds a certain value. (2) Only relaxation: the scaling\ntransforms from $T^{-2k-2}$ to $T^{-2}$ for $k=0$ and to $T^{-a}$ ($a>3$) for\n$k>0$. (3) Pure dephasing and relaxation: the original scaling switches to\n$T^{-1}$ firstly and then evolves to $T^{-2}$ in the adiabatic limit.\nInterestingly, the third scaling-varying style holds even when the expectation\nof pure dephasing rate is much smaller than that of the relaxation rate, which\nis attributed to the vanishing relaxation at the turning points of the\nbraiding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 13:38:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

The method combines statistical\nparameter estimation and model-order selection using a Bayesian framework and\nhas been shown to be especially useful for the analysis of the structure of\nbeam-sensitive nanomaterials. In order to avoid beam damage, images of such\nmaterials are usually acquired using a limited incoming electron dose resulting\nin a low contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) which makes visual inspection\nunreliable. This creates a need for an objective and quantitative approach. The\npresent paper describes the methodology of the MAP probability rule, gives its\nstep-by-step derivation and discusses its algorithmic implementation for atom\ncolumn detection. In addition, simulation results are presented showing that\nthe performance of the MAP probability rule to detect the correct number of\natomic columns from HAADF STEM images is superior to that of other model-order\nselection criteria, including the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the\nBayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Moreover, the MAP probability rule is\nused as a tool to evaluate the relation between STEM image quality measures and\natom detectability resulting in the introduction of the so-called integrated\nCNR (ICNR) as a new image quality measure that better correlates with atom\ndetectability than conventional measures such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nand CNR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 13:45:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}

From the energetic investigations, the\nfour lowest singlet isomers of the [C$_2$,H$_4$,S] family are calculated to be\nnearly isoenergetic, which makes this family a fairly unique test bed for\nassessing possible reaction pathways. Upper limits for the column density of\nsyn and anti vinyl mercaptan are derived toward the extremely molecule-rich\nstar-forming region Sgr B2(N2) enabling comparison with selected complex\norganic molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 15:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

The estimation of the spectral measure is challenging in practice and\nvirtually impossible in high dimensions. This motivates the problem studied in\nthis work, which is to find universal lower and upper bounds of the extreme\nValue-at-Risk under practically estimable constraints. That is, we study the\ninfimum and supremum of the extreme Value-at-Risk functional, over the infinite\ndimensional space of all possible spectral measures that meet a finite set of\nconstraints. We focus on extremal coefficient constraints, which are popular\nand easy to interpret in practice. Our contributions are twofold. Firstly, we\nshow that optimization problems over an infinite dimensional space of spectral\nmeasures are in fact dual problems to linear semi-infinite programs (LSIPs) --\nlinear optimization problems in an Euclidean space with an uncountable set of\nlinear constraints. This allows us to prove that the optimal solutions are in\nfact attained by discrete spectral measures supported on finitely many atoms.\nSecond, in the case of balanced portfolia, we establish further structural\nresults for the lower bounds as well as closed form solutions for both the\nlower- and upper-bounds of extreme Value-at-Risk in the special case of a\nsingle extremal coefficient constraint. The solutions unveil important\nconnections to the Tawn-Molchanov max-stable models. The results are\nillustrated with a real data example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 15:38:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 18:09:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 15:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-09"}

We\ncompare the performance of MuDA, SDDP, and their variants with cut selection\n(using Level 1 and Limited Memory Level 1) on several instances of a portfolio\nproblem and of an inventory problem. On these experiments, in general, SDDP is\nquicker (i.e., satisfies the stopping criterion quicker) than MuDA and cut\nselection allows us to decrease the computational bulk with Limited Memory\nLevel 1 being more efficient (sometimes much more) than Level 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 21:18:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 15:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

In the case where\nthe particles are uniformly distributed through the depth of the film,\nsignificant analytic progress can be made: the governing equations reduce to a\nsingle nonlinear ordinary differential equation, which is readily integrated\nnumerically to obtain the solution subject to appropriate boundary conditions.\nMotivated by possible application to the design of spiral separators, we\nconsider the effects of changing the channel centreline geometry, the\ncross-sectional shape and the particle density on the resulting flows and the\nradial distribution of particles.

These design features mean that business surveys share some\nmethodological challenges with longitudinal surveys. We review the longitudinal\nmethods and approaches which can be used to improve the design and operation of\nbusiness surveys, giving examples of their use. We also look in the other\ndirection, considering the aspects of longitudinal analysis which have the\npotential to improve the accuracy, relevance and interpretation of business\nsurvey outputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 20:21:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 12:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

Here we\nreport ultrafast temperature sensing using all-optical thermometry exploiting\nsynthetic nanodiamonds with silicon-vacancy (SiV) centres embedded at a high\nconcentration. Using multi-parametric analysis of photoluminescence (PL) of\nthese centres, we have achieved an intrinsic noise floor of about 10 mK\nHz$^{-1/2}$, which is a thousand-fold increase in the readout speed in\ncomparison to the current record values demonstrated with all-optical methods\nof comparable spatial-resolution and precision. Our thermometers are smaller\nthan 250-nm across but can detect a 0.4$^\\circ$C change of temperature in a\nmeasurement taking only 0.001 second. The exceptional sensitivity and\nsimplicity of these thermometers enable a wide range of applications such as\ntemperature monitoring and mapping within intracellular regions and in\nstate-of-the-art solid-state electronic nanodevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 21:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}
