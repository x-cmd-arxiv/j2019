It is shown that the proposed scheme of continuous variable\ncontrolled quantum dialogue can be performed using bipartite entanglement and\ncan be reduced to obtain several other two and three party cryptographic\nschemes in the limiting cases. The security of the proposed scheme and its\nadvantage over corresponding discrete variable counterpart are also discussed.\nSpecifically, the ignorance of an eavesdropper in the proposed scheme is shown\nto be very high compared with corresponding discrete variable scheme and thus\nthe present scheme is less prone to information leakage inherent with the\ndiscrete variable quantum dialogue based schemes.It is further established that\nthe proposed scheme can be viewed as a continuous variable counterpart of\nquantum cryptographic switch which allows a supervisor to control the\ninformation transferred between the two legitimate parties to a continuously\nvarying degree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 17:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

Most surgical procedures involve structures deeper than the skin.\nHowever, the difference in surgical noxious stimulation between skin incision\nand laparoscopic trocar insertion is unknown. By analyzing instantaneous heart\nrate (IHR) calculated from the electrocardiogram, in particular the transient\nbradycardia in response to surgical stimuli, this study investigates surgical\nnoxious stimuli arising from skin incision and laparoscopic trocar insertion.\nMethods. Thirty-five patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were\nenrolled in this prospective observational study. Sequential surgical steps\nincluding umbilical skin incision (11 mm), umbilical trocar insertion (11 mm),\nxiphoid skin incision (5 mm), xiphoid trocar insertion (5 mm), subcostal skin\nincision (3 mm), and subcostal trocar insertion (3 mm) were investigated.

On one hand, reactive programming is a\nparadigm which provides programmers with the means to declaratively write\nevent-driven applications. On the other hand, reactive distributed systems\nhandle client requests in a timely fashion regardless of load or failures.\nInquiry: Reactive programming languages and frameworks tailored to the\nimplementation of distributed systems have previously been proposed. However,\nwe argue that these approaches are ill fit to implement reactive distributed\nsystems. Approach: We analyse state of the art runtimes for distributed\nreactive programming and identify two key issues with regards to reactive\ndistributed systems. They rely on single, central points of coordination and/or\nassume a lack of partial failures in the systems they support. Knowledge: Based\non our analysis we propose a novel runtime for distributed reactive programming\nlanguages and frameworks. This runtime supports reactive distributed systems by\ndesign. Grounding: We implement a proof of concept framework for reactive\ndistributed systems in JavaScript which builds atop our runtime. Using this\nframework we implement a case study application which highlights the\napplicability of our approach. Moreover, we benchmark our runtime against a\nsimilar approach in order to showcase its runtime properties and we prove its\ncorrectness. Importance: This work aims to bridge the gap between two kinds of\nreactivity: reactive distributed systems and distributed reactive programming.\nCurrent distributed reactive programming approaches do not support reactive\ndistributed systems. Our runtime is the first to bridge this reactivity gap: it\nallows for reactive distributed systems to be implemented using distributed\nreactive programming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 19:06:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

ParaSail achieves these goals largely through simplification\nof the language, rather than by adding numerous rules.

ParaSail has adopted a pointer-free approach to\ndefining complex data structures.

This challenge is perhaps\nbest exemplified by the need to understand the normal-state charge transport as\nthe system evolves from Mott insulator to Fermi-liquid metal with doping. Here\nwe report a detailed analysis of the temperature (T) and doping (p) dependence\nof the planar resistivity of simple-tetragonal HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\\delta}$\n(Hg1201), the single-CuO$_2$-layer cuprate with the highest optimal $T_c$. The\ndata allow us to test a recently proposed phenomenological model for the\ncuprate phase diagram that combines a universal transport scattering rate with\nspatially inhomogeneous (de)localization of the Mott-localized hole. We find\nthat the model provides an excellent description of the data.

Many meta programming systems process abstract\nsyntax trees, but this requires intimate knowledge of the structure of the data\ntype describing the abstract syntax. As a result, meta programming is\nerror-prone, and meta programs are not resilient to evolution of the structure\nof such ASTs, requiring invasive, fault-prone change to these programs.\nInquiry: Concrete syntax patterns alleviate this problem by allowing the meta\nprogrammer to match and create syntax trees using the actual syntax of the\nobject language. Systems supporting concrete syntax patterns, however, require\na concrete grammar of the object language in their own formalism. Creating such\ngrammars is a costly and error-prone process, especially for realistic\nlanguages such as Java and C++. Approach: In this paper we present Concretely,\na technique to extend meta programming systems with pluggable concrete syntax\npatterns, based on external, black box parsers. We illustrate Concretely in the\ncontext of Rascal, an open-source meta programming system and language\nworkbench, and show how to reuse existing parsers for Java, JavaScript, and\nC++. Furthermore, we propose Tympanic, a DSL to declaratively map external AST\nstructures to Rascal's internal data structures. Tympanic allows implementors\nof Concretely to solve the impedance mismatch between object-oriented class\nhierarchies in Java and Rascal's algebraic data types. Both the algebraic data\ntype and AST marshalling code is automatically generated. Knowledge: The\nconceptual architecture of Concretely and Tympanic supports the reuse of\npre-existing, external parsers, and their AST representation in meta\nprogramming systems that feature concrete syntax patterns for matching and\nconstructing syntax trees. As such this opens up concrete syntax pattern\nmatching for a host of realistic languages for which writing a grammar from\nscratch is time consuming and error-prone, but for which industry-strength\nparsers exist in the wild. Grounding: We evaluate Concretely in terms of source\nlines of code (SLOC), relative to the size of the AST data type and marshalling\ncode. We show that for real programming languages such as C++ and Java, adding\nsupport for concrete syntax patterns takes an effort only in the order of\ndozens of SLOC. Similarly, we evaluate Tympanic in terms of SLOC, showing an\norder of magnitude of reduction in SLOC compared to manual implementation of\nthe AST data types and marshalling code. Importance: Meta programming has\napplications in reverse engineering, reengineering, source code analysis,\nstatic analysis, software renovation, domain-specific language engineering, and\nmany others. Processing of syntax trees is central to all of these tasks.\nConcrete syntax patterns improve the practice of constructing meta programs.\nThe combination of Concretely and Tympanic has the potential to make concrete\nsyntax patterns available with very little effort, thereby improving and\npromoting the application of meta programming in the general software\nengineering context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 20:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

They guarantee\ncommunicationsafety for a language of multiparty sessions (LMS), i.e.,\ndistributed, parallel components can exchange values without deadlocking and\nunexpected message types. Several variants of MST and LMS have been proposed to\nstudy key features of distributed and parallel programming.

These hamper evolution of session types\nand languages and their adoption in practice. This paper addresses the\nfollowing question: What are the essential features for MST and LMS, and how\ncan these be modelled with simple constructs? To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first time this question has been addressed. We performed a\nsystematic analysis of the features and the constructs in MST, LMS, and the\nconsidered variants to identify the essential features. The variants are among\nthe most influential (according to Google Scholar) and well-established systems\nthat cover a wide set of areas in distributed, parallel programming.

The analysis\nremoves overlapping features and captures the shared traits, thereby\nintroducing the essential features. The constructs of the language are simple\nand fundamental, based on the $\\lambda$ and $\\pi$ calculi. Analogously, our\nglobal types reflect what is omitted and introduced in the language. Our system\ncovers all the features of the original and variants, with a better ratio of\nthe number of language and type constructs over the number of covered features.\nThe features of the original, variants, and our system along with the number of\nconstructs in the respective language and global types to model them are\npresented through a table. The syntax, operational semantics, meta-theory and\ntype system of our system are given. We modelled all the motivating examples of\nthe variants in our model, describing the reduction and typing steps. The work\ndiscusses how new features, in particular the non-essential ones (formerly\nexcluded) and advanced ones can be either modelled atop the essential ones or\nadded with minimal efforts, i.e. without modifying the existing ones. The\nfundamental properties of typed processes such as subject reduction,\ncommunication safety, and progress are established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 20:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

One of the main advantages of this\nkind of composition is that it makes possible to separate subtyping from\nsubclassing; which is good for code-reuse, design and reasoning. However,\nhandling of state within traits is difficult, verbose or inelegant. Inquiry: We\nidentify the this-leaking problem as the fundamental limitation that prevents\nthe separation of subtyping from subclassing in conventional OO languages. We\nexplain that the concept of trait composition addresses this problem, by\ndistinguishing code designed for use (as a type) from code designed for reuse\n(i.e. inherited). We are aware of at least 3 concrete independently designed\nresearch languages following this methodology: TraitRecordJ, Package Templates\nand DeepFJig. Approach: In this paper, we design $42_\\mu$ a new language, where\nwe improve use and reuse and support the This type and family polymorphism by\ndistinguishing code designed for use from code designed for reuse. In this way\n$42_\\mu$ synthesise the 3 approaches above, and improves them with abstract\nstate operations: a new elegant way to handle state composition in trait based\nlanguages. Knowledge and Grounding: Using case studies, we show that $42_\\mu$'s\nmodel of traits with abstract state operations is more usable and compact than\nprior work. We formalise our work and prove that type errors cannot arise from\ncomposing well typed code. Importance: This work is the logical core of the\nprogramming language 42. This shows that the ideas presented in this paper can\nbe applicable to a full general purpose language.

Stars from 8-M$_{\\odot}$ to 13-M$_{\\odot}$ constitute roughly 50% of\nall massive stars, so the explosive potential for this mass range is important\nto the overall theory of CCSNe.

Factors conducive to explosion are turbulence behind the\nstalled shock, energy transfer due to neutrino-matter absorption and\nneutrino-matter scattering, many-body corrections to the neutrino-nucleon\nscattering rate, and the presence of a sharp silicon-oxygen interface in the\nprogenitor. Our 3D exploding models frequently have a dipolar structure, with\nthe two asymmetrical exploding lobes separated by a pinched waist where matter\ntemporarily continues to accrete. This process maintains the driving neutrino\nluminosty, while partially shunting matter out of the way of the expanding\nlobes, thereby modestly facilitating explosion. The morphology of all 3D\nexplosions is characterized by multiple bubble structures with a range of\nlow-order harmonic modes.

There\nare two main implementation techniques for EDSLs: shallow embeddings and deep\nembeddings. Inquiry: Shallow embeddings are quite simple, but they have been\ncriticized in the past for being quite limited in terms of modularity and\nreuse. In particular, it is often argued that supporting multiple DSL\ninterpretations in shallow embeddings is difficult. Approach: This paper argues\nthat shallow EDSLs and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are closely related.\nGibbons and Wu already discussed the relationship between shallow EDSLs and\nprocedural abstraction, while Cook discussed the connection between procedural\nabstraction and OOP. We make the transitive step in this paper by connecting\nshallow EDSLs directly to OOP via procedural abstraction. The knowledge about\nthis relationship enables us to improve on implementation techniques for EDSLs.\nKnowledge: This paper argues that common OOP mechanisms (including inheritance,\nsubtyping, and type-refinement) increase the modularity and reuse of shallow\nEDSLs when compared to classical procedural abstraction by enabling a simple\nway to express multiple, possibly dependent, interpretations. Grounding: We\nmake our arguments by using Gibbons and Wu's examples, where procedural\nabstraction is used in Haskell to model a simple shallow EDSL. We recode that\nEDSL in Scala and with an improved OO-inspired Haskell encoding. We further\nillustrate our approach with a case study on refactoring a deep external SQL\nquery processor to make it more modular, shallow, and embedded. Importance:\nThis work is important for two reasons. Firstly, from an intellectual point of\nview, this work establishes the connection between shallow embeddings and OOP,\nwhich enables a better understanding of both concepts. Secondly, this work\nillustrates programming techniques that can be used to improve the modularity\nand reuse of shallow EDSLs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 20:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

Live programming aims to support the development and comprehension\nof programs by providing more immediate feedback on program behavior, but the\ndivide between code and behavior often remains. The goal of example-based live\nprogramming is to remove this gap by allowing programmers to explore the actual\nbehavior of their code during development. This is achieved by defining live\nexamples for parts of the application. The idea of live examples has been\nalready addressed in other tools and environments.

Thus, we aim to extend the application of example-based live\nprogramming to more complex programs potentially spanning multiple modules.

However, such geometric curvature utilizes only\nthe kinematic information (two-way traveltime) of the available seismic\nsignals. While analyzing the dynamic information (waveform), the traditional\napproaches (e.g., complex trace analysis) are often trace-wise and thereby fail\nto take into account the seismic reflector continuity and deviate from the true\ndirection of geologic deposition, especially for steeply dipping formations.\nThis study proposes extending the 3D curvature analysis to the waveforms in a\nseismic profile, here denoted as the waveform curvature, and investigates the\nassociated implications for assisting seismic interpretation. Applications to\nthe F3 seismic dataset over the Netherlands North Sea demonstrate the added\nvalues of the proposed waveform curvature analysis in four aspects. First, the\ncapability of the curvature operator in differentiating convex and concave\nbending allows automatic decomposition of a seismic image by the reflector\ntypes (peaks, troughs and zero-crossings), which can greatly facilitate\ncomputer-aided horizon interpretation and modelling from 3D seismic data.\nSecond, the signed minimum curvature offers a new analytical approach for\nestimating the fundamental and important reflector dip attribute by searching\nthe orientation associated with least waveform variation. Third, the signed\nmaximum curvature makes it possible to analyze the seismic signals along the\nnormal direction of the reflection events. Finally, the curvature analysis\npromotes the frequency bands of the seismic signals and thereby enhances the\napparent resolution on identifying and interpreting subtle seismic features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 22:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

The controller is validated through\nextensive simulation and compared to an alternate POMDP solution and\nexperimental results are provided on a research vehicle for a virtual\npedestrian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2019 00:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

Unfortunately, solving the resulting nonlinear\noptimal control problem is typically computationally expensive and infeasible\nfor real-time trajectory planning. This paper presents an iterative algorithm\nthat divides the path generation task into two sequential subproblems that are\nsignificantly easier to solve. Given an initial path through the race track,\nthe algorithm runs a forward-backward integration scheme to determine the\nminimum-time longitudinal speed profile, subject to tire friction constraints.\nWith this fixed speed profile, the algorithm updates the vehicle's path by\nsolving a convex optimization problem that minimizes the resulting path\ncurvature while staying within track boundaries and obeying affine,\ntime-varying vehicle dynamics constraints. This two-step process is repeated\niteratively until the predicted lap time no longer improves. While providing no\nguarantees of convergence or a globally optimal solution, the approach performs\nvery well when validated on the Thunderhill Raceway course in Willows, CA. The\npredicted lap time converges after four to five iterations, with each iteration\nover the full 4.5 km race course requiring only thirty seconds of computation\ntime on a laptop computer. The resulting trajectory is experimentally driven at\nthe race circuit with an autonomous Audi TTS test vehicle, and the resulting\nlap time and racing line is comparable to both a nonlinear gradient descent\nsolution and a trajectory recorded from a professional racecar driver. The\nexperimental results indicate that the proposed method is a viable option for\nonline trajectory planning in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2019 01:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

As a result,\nmeasures of eye contact arise in a variety of applications such as the\nassessment of the social communication skills of children at risk for\ndevelopmental disorders such as autism, or the analysis of turn-taking and\nsocial roles during group meetings. However, the automated measurement of\nvisual attention during naturalistic social interactions is challenging due to\nthe difficulty of estimating a subject's looking direction from video. This\npaper proposes a novel approach to eye contact detection during adult-child\nsocial interactions in which the adult wears a point-of-view camera which\ncaptures an egocentric view of the child's behavior. By analyzing the child's\nface regions and inferring their head pose we can accurately identify the onset\nand duration of the child's looks to their social partner's eyes.

In contrast, most applications in machine learning, including\nGANs and adversarial training, correspond to sequential games, where the order\nof which player acts first is crucial (since minimax is in general not equal to\nmaximin due to the nonconvex-nonconcave nature of the problems).

The main idea of the math model\nis to minimize the elastic energy(bending energy) of the vesicles, with some\nconstraints designed regarding the biological properties of Golgi stack. With\nthese constraints attached to the math model, we could extend this model to an\nobstacle-type problem.

The maximum of K appears near the wall in both coordinate\naxis of the duct. According to the energy gradient theory, this position of the\nmaximum of K would initiate flow instability (if any) than the other positions.\nThe higher the Hartmann number is, the smaller the K value becomes, which means\nthat the fluid becomes more stable in the presence of higher magnetic force. As\nthe Hartmann number increases, the K value in the parallel layer decreases more\nsignificantly than in the Hartmann layer. The most dangerous position of\ninstability tends to migrate towards wall of the duct as the Hartmann number\nincreases.

In this paper, we propose\na deep neural network framework for large-scale spatial time series forecasting\nproblems. We explicitly designed the neural network architecture for capturing\nvarious types of patterns. In preprocessing, a time series decomposition method\nis applied to separately feed short-term, long-term and spatial patterns into\ndifferent components of a neural network. A fuzzy clustering method finds\ncluster of neighboring time series based on similarity of time series\nresiduals; as they can be meaningful short-term patterns for spatial time\nseries. In neural network architecture, each kernel of a multi-kernel\nconvolution layer is applied to a cluster of time series to extract short-term\nfeatures in neighboring areas. The output of convolution layer is concatenated\nby trends and followed by convolution-LSTM layer to capture long-term patterns\nin larger regional areas. To make a robust prediction when faced with missing\ndata, an unsupervised pretrained denoising autoencoder reconstructs the output\nof the model in a fine-tuning step.

Most cross-modal hashing methods follow the traditional supervised\nhashing framework in which the $O(n^2)$ data pairs and $O(n^3)$ data triplets\nare generated for training, but the training procedure is less efficient\nbecause the complexity is high for large-scale dataset. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel and efficient cross-modal hashing algorithm in which\nthe unary loss is introduced. First of all, We introduce the Cross-Modal Unary\nLoss (CMUL) with $O(n)$ complexity to bridge the traditional triplet loss and\nclassification-based unary loss.

Second, we propose the\nnovel Joint Cluster Cross-Modal Hashing (JCCH) algorithm for efficient hash\nlearning, in which the CMUL is involved. The resultant hashcodes form several\nclusters in which the hashcodes in the same cluster share similar semantic\ninformation, and the heterogeneity gap on different modalities is diminished by\nsharing the clusters. The proposed algorithm is able to be applied to various\ntypes of data, and experiments on large-scale datasets show that the proposed\nmethod is superior over or comparable with state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing\nmethods, and training with the proposed method is more efficient than others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2019 05:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

In this paper, we demonstrate that the missing\nconsideration of access patterns and dynamic data distribution notably hinders\nthe applicability of learned indexes. To this end, we propose solutions for\nlearned indexes for dynamic workloads (called Doraemon). To improve the latency\nfor skew queries, Doraemon augments the training data with access frequencies.\nTo address the slow model re-training when data distribution shifts, Doraemon\ncaches the previously-trained models and incrementally fine-tunes them for\nsimilar access patterns and data distribution. Our preliminary result shows\nthat, Doraemon improves the query latency by 45.1% and reduces the model\nre-training time to 1/20.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2019 07:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

The EOSs computed\nusing different methods cross validate one another, and the experimental\nHugoniot are in good agreement with our theoretical predictions.

The photo-scene\nencoder contains two sub-encoders, namely the photo and scene encoders, which\nare stacked together and behave hierarchically to fully exploit the structure\ninformation of the photos within an album. Specifically, the photo encoder\ngenerates semantic representation for each photo while exploiting temporal\nrelationships among them. The scene encoder, relying on the obtained photo\nrepresentations, is responsible for detecting the scene changes and generating\nscene representations. Subsequently, the decoder dynamically and attentively\nsummarizes the encoded photo and scene representations to generate a sequence\nof album representations, based on which a story consisting of multiple\ncoherent sentences is generated. In order to fully extract the useful semantic\ninformation from an album, a reconstructor is employed to reproduce the\nsummarized album representations based on the hidden states of the decoder.

Each sentence of the corpus is then scored individually, using\npopular node ranking algorithms, and a summary is produced by extracting highly\nscored sentences. This approach fails to select a subset of jointly relevant\nsentences and it may produce redundant summaries that are missing important\ntopics of the corpus. To alleviate this issue, a new hypergraph-based\nsummarizer is proposed in this paper, in which each node is a sentence and each\nhyperedge is a theme, namely a group of sentences sharing a topic. Themes are\nweighted in terms of their prominence in the corpus and their relevance to a\nuser-defined query. It is further shown that the problem of identifying a\nsubset of sentences covering the relevant themes of the corpus is equivalent to\nthat of finding a hypergraph transversal in our theme-based hypergraph. Two\nextensions of the notion of hypergraph transversal are proposed for the purpose\nof summarization, and polynomial time algorithms building on the theory of\nsubmodular functions are proposed for solving the associated discrete\noptimization problems. The worst-case time complexity of the proposed\nalgorithms is squared in the number of terms, which makes it cheaper than the\nexisting hypergraph-based methods.

Estimating the structure of these\ninternal states is crucial for understanding the neural basis of behavior. In\nprinciple, internal states can be estimated by inverting behavior models, as in\ninverse model-based Reinforcement Learning. However, this requires careful\nparameterization and risks model-mismatch to the animal. Here we take a\ndata-driven approach to infer latent states directly from observations of\nbehavior, using a partially observable switching semi-Markov process. This\nprocess has two elements critical for capturing animal behavior: it captures\nnon-exponential distribution of times between observations, and transitions\nbetween latent states depend on the animal's actions, features that require\nmore complex non-markovian models to represent. To demonstrate the utility of\nour approach, we apply it to the observations of a simulated optimal agent\nperforming a foraging task, and find that latent dynamics extracted by the\nmodel has correspondences with the belief dynamics of the agent. Finally, we\napply our model to identify latent states in the behaviors of monkey performing\na foraging task, and find clusters of latent states that identify periods of\ntime consistent with expectant waiting. This data-driven behavioral model will\nbe valuable for inferring latent cognitive states, and thereby for measuring\nneural representations of those states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2019 09:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

In this framework, Russo and Van Roy\nproposed an information-theoretic analysis of Thompson Sampling based on the\ninformation ratio, resulting in optimal worst-case regret bounds. In this paper\nwe introduce three novel ideas to this line of work. First we propose a new\nquantity, the scale-sensitive information ratio, which allows us to obtain more\nrefined first-order regret bounds (i.e., bounds of the form $\\sqrt{L^*}$ where\n$L^*$ is the loss of the best combinatorial action). Second we replace the\nentropy over combinatorial actions by a coordinate entropy, which allows us to\nobtain the first optimal worst-case bound for Thompson Sampling in the\ncombinatorial setting. Finally, we introduce a novel link between Bayesian\nagents and frequentist confidence intervals. Combining these ideas we show that\nthe classical multi-armed bandit first-order regret bound $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{d\nL^*})$ still holds true in the more challenging and more general semi-bandit\nscenario. This latter result improves the previous state of the art bound\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{(d+m^3)L^*})$ by Lykouris, Sridharan and Tardos.\n  Moreover we sharpen these results with two technical ingredients.

The double-peaked emission lines could also be due to jet-ISM\ninteraction or rotating disks. One of the best ways to confirm dual/binary AGN\nin double-peaked AGN (DPAGN) is by using high resolution radio observations. We\nhave observed a sample of 20 DPAGN at two or more frequencies using the Karl G.\nJansky Very Large Array (VLA), of which one source is already published and the\nremaining 19 are presented in this paper.

Of the remaining sources, one has a\nclear core-jet structure and another source could be a core-jet structure or a\nDAGN. The remaining 13 sources are single cores while one source is not\ndetected at any frequency. We find that for our dual AGN detection, the DPAGN\nemission lines do not originate from the dual/binary AGN. Instead, they could\nbe due to outflows or jets.

We present a novel\nonline health data De-Anonymization (DA) framework, named De-Health. De-Health\nconsists of two phases: Top-K DA, which identifies a candidate set for each\nanonymized user, and refined DA, which de-anonymizes an anonymized user to a\nuser in its candidate set. By employing both candidate selection and DA\nverification schemes, De-Health significantly reduces the DA space by several\norders of magnitude while achieving promising DA accuracy. Leveraging two real\nworld online health datasets WebMD (89,393 users, 506K posts) and HealthBoards\n(388,398 users, 4.7M posts), we validate the efficacy of De-Health. Further,\nwhen the training data are insufficient, De-Health can still successfully\nde-anonymize a large portion of anonymized users.\n  We develop the first analytical framework on the soundness and effectiveness\nof online health data DA. By analyzing the impact of various data features on\nthe anonymity, we derive the conditions and probabilities for successfully\nde-anonymizing one user or a group of users in exact DA and Top-K DA.

A typical use is to extend\nor amplify the capabilities of a human in cognitive or physical ways, requiring\nthe machine to adapt to the users' intentions and preferences. Often, this\ntakes the form of a human operator providing some type of feedback to the user,\nwhich can be explicit feedback, implicit feedback, or a combination of both.\nExplicit feedback, such as through a mouse click, carries a high cognitive\nload. The focus of this study is to extend the current state of the art in\ninteractive machine learning by demonstrating that agents can learn a human\nuser's behavior and adapt to preferences with a reduced amount of explicit\nhuman feedback in a mixed feedback setting. The learning agent perceives a\nvalue of its own behavior from hand gestures given via a spatial interface.\nThis feedback mechanism is termed Spatial Interface Valuing.

Aims: To quantify the interaction\nof HD 100453 B with the circumprimary disk. Methods: Using ALMA band 6 dust\ncontinuum and CO isotopologue observations we study the HD 100453 AB system\nwith a spatial resolution of 0.09\" x 0.17\" at 234 GHz. We use SPH simulations\nand orbital fitting to investigate the tidal influence of the companion on the\ndisk. Results: We resolve the continuum emission around HD 100453 A into a disk\nbetween 0.22\" and 0.40\" with an inclination of 29.5 deg. and a position angle\nof 151.0 deg., an unresolved inner disk, and excess mm emission cospatial with\nthe northern spiral arm which was previously detected using scattered light\nobservations. We also detect CO emission from 7 au (well within the disk\ncavity) out to 1.10\", i.e., overlapping with HD 100453 B at least in\nprojection. The outer CO disk PA and inclination differ by up to 10 deg. from\nthe values found for the inner CO disk and the dust continuum emission, which\nwe interpret as due to gravitational interaction with HD 100453 B. Both the\nspatial extent of the CO disk and the detection of mm emission at the same\nlocation as the northern spiral arm are in disagreement with the previously\nproposed near co-planar orbit of HD 100453 B. Conclusions: We conclude that HD\n100453 B has an orbit that is significantly misaligned with the circumprimary\ndisk. Because it is unclear whether such an orbit can explain the observed\nsystem geometry we highlight an alternative scenario that explains all detected\ndisk features where another, (yet) undetected, low mass close companion within\nthe disk cavity, shepherds a misaligned inner disk whose slowly precessing\nshadows excite the spiral arms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2019 13:55:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

These devices need to maximize\ntheir accuracy and active time under a tight energy budget imposed by battery\nand small form-factor constraints. This paper considers energy harvesting\ndevices that run on a limited energy budget to recognize user activities over a\ngiven period. We propose a technique to co-optimize the accuracy and active\ntime by utilizing multiple design points with different energy-accuracy\ntrade-offs. The proposed technique switches between these design points at\nruntime to maximize a generalized objective function under tight harvested\nenergy budget constraints. We evaluate the proposed approach experimentally\nusing a custom hardware prototype and fourteen user studies. The proposed\napproach achieves both 46% higher expected accuracy and 66% longer active time\ncompared to the highest performance design point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2019 05:55:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 05:46:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-25"}

While the focus has\nhitherto been placed on areas with high population density, we address the\nchallenging undertaking of predicting crime hotspots in regions with low\npopulation densities and highly unequally-distributed crime.This results in a\nsevere sparsity (i.e., class imbalance) of the outcome variable, which impedes\npredictive modeling. To alleviate this, we develop machine learning models for\nspatio-temporal prediction that are specifically adjusted for an imbalanced\ndistribution of the class labels and test them in an actual setting with\nstate-of-the-art predictors (i.e., socio-economic, geographical, temporal,\nmeteorological, and crime variables in fine resolution). The proposed\nimbalance-aware hyper-ensemble increases the hit ratio considerably from 18.1%\nto 24.6% when aiming for the top 5% of hotspots, and from 53.1% to 60.4% when\naiming for the top 20% of hotspots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 17:34:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

Much of the discussion has been about the data:\nhuge volumes of 2D and 3D spatial data and spatio-temporal data are now being\ncollected and stored; so how they can be accessed? and how can we map and\ninterpret massive datasets in an effective manner? Less attention has been paid\nto questions regarding the analysis of Big Data, although this has risen up the\nagenda in recent times. Examples include the use of density analysis to\nrepresent map request events, with Esri demonstrating that (given sufficient\nresources) they can process and analyze large numbers of data point events\nusing kernel density techniques within a very short timeframe (under a minute);\ndata filtering (to extract subsets of data that are of particular interest);\nand data mining (broader than simple filtering). For real-time data, sequential\nanalysis has also been successfully applied; in this case the data are received\nas a stream and are used to build up a dynamic map or to cumulatively generate\nstatistical values that may be mapped and/or used to trigger events or alarms.\nTo this extent the analysis is similar to that conducted on smaller datasets,\nbut with data and processing architectures that are specifically designed to\ncope with the data volumes involved and with a focus on data exploration as a\nkey mechanism for discovery. Miller and Goodchild (2014) have argued that\nconsiderable care is required when working with Big Data significant issues\narise from each of the \"four Vs of Big Data\": the sheer Volume of data; the\nVelocity of data arrival; the Variety of forms of data and their origins; and\nthe Veracity of such data. As such, geospatial research has had to adapt to\nharness new forms of data to validly represent real-world phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2019 11:26:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-19"}
