General relativistic\nexplanations are known and already widely explained in many papers. Such\ngeneral relativistic approaches are founded on Einstein's equivalence principle\n(EEP), which states the equivalence between the gravitational \"force\" and the\npseudo-force experienced by an observer in a non-inertial frame of reference,\nincluded a rotating observer. Typically, the authors consider the so-called\nLangevin-Landau-Lifschitz metric and the path of light is determined by null\ngeodesics. This approach partially hides the physical meaning of the effect. It\nseems indeed that the light speed varies by c\\pm\\omega r in one or the other\ndirection around the disk. In this paper, a slightly different general\nrelativistic approach will be used. The different \"gravitational field\" acting\non the beam splitter and on the two rays of light is analyzed. This different\napproach permits a better understanding of the physical meaning of the Sagnac\neffect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 16:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-19"}

In the case of\nsedentary marine populations, connectivity stems not only from the stochastic\nnature of the physical environment that affects early-life stages dispersal,\nbut also from the spawning stock attributes that affect the reproductive output\n(e.g., passive eggs and larvae) and its survivorship. Early-life stages are\nvirtually impossible to track in the ocean. Therefore, numerical ocean current\nsimulations coupled to egg and larval Lagrangian transport models remain the\nmost common approach for the assessment of marine larval connectivity. Inferred\nlarval connectivity may be different depending on the type of connectivity\nconsidered; consequently, the prioritisation of sites for marine populations'\nconservation might also differ.

Outputs\nfrom network analysis are used to: (1) identify critical areas for improving\noverall larval connectivity; (2) assess the impact of species' biological\nparameters in network connectivity; and (3) explore alternative MPA\nconfigurations to improve average network connectivity. Results demonstrate the\npotential of graph theory to identify non-trivial egg/larval dispersal patterns\nand emerging collective properties of the MPA network which are relevant for\nincreasing protection efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 16:36:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 10:22:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 15:37:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 05:35:25 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 19:35:14 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 17:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

However, the majority of existing RL-based\nrecommender systems focus on optimizing one strategy for all scenarios or\nseparately optimizing each strategy, which could lead to sub-optimal overall\nperformance. In this paper, we study the recommendation problem with multiple\n(consecutive) scenarios, i.e., whole-chain recommendations. We propose a\nmulti-agent RL-based approach (DeepChain), which can capture the sequential\ncorrelation among different scenarios and jointly optimize multiple\nrecommendation strategies.

Note that optimizing multiple\nrecommendation strategies jointly faces two challenges in the existing\nmodel-free RL model - (i) it requires huge amounts of user behavior data, and\n(ii) the distribution of reward (users' feedback) are extremely unbalanced.

The SN-CH and the CH-FC channels suffer\nfrom additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). In this context, we derive the\noptimal log-likelihood ratio (LLR) fusion rule, which turns out to be\nintractable. So, we develop a sub-optimal linear fusion rule (LFR) that weighs\nthe cluster's data according to both its local detection performance and the\nquality of the communication channels.

While the\nfull structure of the hierarchy is still not understood, Cui et al.\n(arXiv:1608.06596) recently described the structure of diagonal unitaries in\nthe hierarchy. They considered diagonal gates whose action on a computational\nbasis qudit state is described by a $2^k$-th root of unity raised to a\npolynomial function of the state, and they established the level of such\nunitaries in the hierarchy. For qubit systems, we consider $k$-th level\ndiagonal gates that can be described just by quadratic forms of the state over\nthe ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$ of integers mod $2^k$.

Face-SSD\nuses a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) to detect multiple faces of\ndifferent sizes and recognise/regress one or more face-related classes.\nFace-SSD has two parallel branches that share the same low-level filters, one\nbranch dealing with face detection and the other one with face analysis tasks.\nThe outputs of both branches are spatially aligned heatmaps that are produced\nin parallel - therefore Face-SSD does not require that face detection, facial\nregion extraction, size normalisation, and facial region processing are\nperformed in subsequent steps. Our contributions are threefold: 1) Face-SSD is\nthe first network to perform face analysis without relying on pre-processing\nsuch as face detection and registration in advance - Face-SSD is a simple and a\nsingle FCNN architecture simultaneously performing face detection and\nface-related task analysis - those are conventionally treated as separate\nconsecutive tasks; 2) Face-SSD is a generalised architecture that is applicable\nfor various face analysis tasks without modifying the network structure - this\nis in contrast to designing task-specific architectures; and 3) Face-SSD\nachieves real-time performance (21 FPS) even when detecting multiple faces and\nrecognising multiple classes in a given image.

A particularly challenging class of\nproblems in this area is partially observable, cooperative, multi-agent\nlearning, in which teams of agents must learn to coordinate their behaviour\nwhile conditioning only on their private observations. This is an attractive\nresearch area since such problems are relevant to a large number of real-world\nsystems and are also more amenable to evaluation than general-sum problems.\nStandardised environments such as the ALE and MuJoCo have allowed single-agent\nRL to move beyond toy domains, such as grid worlds. However, there is no\ncomparable benchmark for cooperative multi-agent RL. As a result, most papers\nin this field use one-off toy problems, making it difficult to measure real\nprogress. In this paper, we propose the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC)\nas a benchmark problem to fill this gap. SMAC is based on the popular real-time\nstrategy game StarCraft II and focuses on micromanagement challenges where each\nunit is controlled by an independent agent that must act based on local\nobservations. We offer a diverse set of challenge maps and recommendations for\nbest practices in benchmarking and evaluations.

Characteristic mid-IR spectral features\nindicate that the grains consist mainly of silicates and corundum. The latter\nspecies seems to form in a narrow zone within about 2 stellar radii, preceding\nthe condensation of silicate dust, which triggers the outflow. Recent\nhigh-angular-resolution observations show clumpy, variable dust clouds at these\ndistances. We explore possible causes for the formation of inhomogeneous dust\nlayers, using 3D dynamical simulations. We modeled the outer convective\nenvelope and the dust-forming atmosphere of an M-type AGB star with the CO5BOLD\nradiation-hydrodynamics code. The simulations account for frequency-dependent\ngas opacities, and include a time-dependent description of grain growth and\nevaporation for corundum and olivine-type silicates. In the inner,\ngravitationally bound, and corundum-dominated layers of the circumstellar\nenvelope, a patchy distribution of the dust emerges naturally, due to\natmospheric shock waves that are generated by large-scale convective flows and\npulsations. The formation of silicate dust at somewhat larger distances\nprobably indicates the outer limit of the gravitationally bound layers. The\ncurrent models do not describe wind acceleration, but the cloud formation\nmechanism should also work for stars with outflows. Timescales of atmospheric\ndynamics and grain growth are similar to observed values. In spherical averages\nof dust densities the variable 3D morphology manifests itself as cycle-to-cycle\nvariations. Grain growth in the wake of large-scale non-spherical shock waves,\ngenerated by convection and pulsations, is a likely mechanism for producing the\nobserved clumpy dust clouds, and for explaining their physical and dynamical\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 16:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

The origin of those\npossible planets is still unclear but accretion tracers and VLT/SPHERE\nobservations indicate that they are surrounded by circumplanetary material or\neven a circumplanetary disk. We want to investigate if the gas component of\ndisks around wide-orbit companions is detectable with current and future\n(sub)mm telescopes and what constraints such gas observations can provide on\nthe nature of the circumplanetary material and on the mass of the companion. We\napplied the radiation thermo-chemical disk code ProDiMo to model the dust and\ngas component of passive circumplanetary disks and produced realistic synthetic\nobservables. We considered different companion properties, disk parameters and\nradiative environments and compared the resulting synthetic observables to\ntelescope sensitivities and to existing dust observations. The main criterion\nfor a successful detection is the size of the circumplanetary disk. At a\ndistance of about 150 pc, a circumplanetary disk with an outer radius of about\n10 au is detectable with ALMA in about 6 hours in optically thick CO lines.\nOther aspects such as the companion's luminosity, disk inclination and\nbackground radiation fields are also relevant and should be considered to\noptimize the observing strategy for detection experiments. For most of the\nknown wide-orbit planet-mass companions, their maximum theoretical disk size of\none third of the Hill radius would be sufficient to allow detection of CO\nlines. It is therefore feasible to detect their gas disks and constrain the\nmass of the companion through the kinematic signature. Even in the case of\nnon-detections such observations will provide stringent constraints on disk\nsize and gas mass, information crucial for formation theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 19:02:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 16:34:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

Given the full batch of\ndata, EM forms an upper-bound of the negative log-likelihood of the model at\neach iteration and updates to the minimizer of this upper-bound. We first\nprovide a \"model level\" interpretation of the EM upper-bound as sum of relative\nentropy divergences to a set of singleton models, induced by the set of\nobservations. Our alternative motivation unifies the \"observation level\" and\nthe \"model level\" view of the EM. As a result, we formulate an online version\nof the EM algorithm by adding an analogous inertia term which corresponds to\nthe relative entropy divergence to the old model. Our motivation is more widely\napplicable than the previous approaches and leads to simple online updates for\nmixture of exponential distributions, hidden Markov models, and the first known\nonline update for Kalman filters. Additionally, the finite sample form of the\ninertia term lets us derive online updates when there is no closed-form\nsolution. Finally, we extend the analysis to the distributed setting where we\nmotivate a systematic way of combining multiple hidden variable models.\nExperimentally, we validate the results on synthetic as well as real-world\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 19:35:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 06:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-24"}

For fast and accurate anomaly detection, managing an\naccurate working set of active flows (WSAF) from massive volumes of packet\ninfluxes at line rates is a key challenge.

The host galaxy is a quiescent early type galaxy at $z$ = 0.0899\nwith a blackhole mass of $2\\times10^7M_\\odot$. The transient underwent a 2.5\nmagnitude brightening over $\\sim120$ days, reaching a peak $V$-band luminosity\n(extinction corrected) of $-20.9$ magnitude, then fading 0.5 magnitude over 200\ndays, settling into a plateau of $>600$ days. Following the optical brightening\nare the significant mid-IR flares at $3.4$ and $4.5\\mu$m, with a peak time\ndelay of $\\sim180$ days. The mid-IR LCs are explained as the echo of UV photons\nby a dust medium with a radius of $5\\times10^{17}$ cm, consistent with $\\rm\nE(B-V)$ of 0.58 inferred from the spectra.

Various strategies\nhave arisen to answer questions about mixtures, including methods such as\nweighted quantile sum (WQS) regression that estimate a joint effect of the\nmixture components.We demonstrate a new approach to estimating the joint\neffects of a mixture: quantile g-computation. This approach combines the\ninferential simplicity of WQS regression with the flexibility of g-computation,\na method of causal effect estimation. We use simulations to examine whether\nquantile g-computation and WQS regression can accurately and precisely estimate\neffects of mixtures in common scenarios. We examine the bias, confidence\ninterval coverage, and bias-variance tradeoff of quantile g-computation and WQS\nregression, and how these quantities are impacted by the presence of non-causal\nexposures, exposure correlation, unmeasured confounding, and non-linear\neffects. Quantile g-computation, unlike WQS regression allows inference on\nmixture effects that is unbiased with appropriate confidence interval coverage\nat sample sizes typically encountered in epidemiologic studies and when the\nassumptions of WQS regression are not met.

By calculating electric field-induced\nmagnetization by the linear response theory, we reveal that the magnetoelectric\neffect shows up without specific parameter choices. The magnetoelectric effect\nqualitatively varies by changing the direction of the magnetic moment in the\nferromagnet: the response is diagonal for the out-of-plane moment, whereas it\nis off-diagonal for the inplane moment. We also find out that in optical\nfrequencies, the magnetoelectric signal can be drastically enhanced via\ninterband resonant excitations.

This has a lot of advantages for the analyst. First and\nforemost, it can easily be identified on a large scale what has actually been\nviewed and read on the stimuli pages by the subjects. Second, the web page\nstructure can be used to filter to AOIs. Third, gaze data of multiple users can\nbe presented on the same page, and fourth, fixation times on text can be\nexported and further processed in other tools.

Most notably, they systematically violate energy\nconservation as they do not balance buoyant energy generation with terms that\nreduce potential energy, thus failing to account for the physical source of\nenergy that buoyant convection feeds on. We also point out other non-trivial\nconsistency requirements for viable turbulence models. The model of Kuhfuss\n(1986) proves more consistent than the newly proposed approaches for\nsupernovae, but still cannot account naturally for all the relevant physics for\npredicting explosion properties. We perform numerical simulations for a $20\nM_\\odot$ progenitor to further illustrate problems of 1D turbulence models. If\nthe buoyant driving term is formulated in a conservative manner, the explosion\nenergy of $\\mathord{\\sim}2\\times 10^{51}\\, \\mathrm{erg}$ for the corresponding\nnon-conservative turbulence model is reduced to $<10^{48}\\,\\mathrm{erg}$ even\nthough the shock expands continuously.

We aim to constrain the efficiency of this process by investigating\nrotation rates of 2.5 M$_{\\odot}$ stars. First, we investigated whether the\nTayler-Spruit dynamo could be responsible for the extra transport of angular\nmomentum for stars with an initial mass of 2.5 M$_{\\odot}$. Then, by computing\nrotating models including a constant additional artificial viscosity, we\ndetermined the efficiency of the missing process of angular momentum transport\nby comparing the models to the asteroseismic observations of core helium\nburning stars. Parameter studies were performed to investigate the effect of\nthe stellar evolution code used, initial mass, and evolutionary stage. We\nevolved our models into the white dwarf phase, and provide a comparison to\nwhite dwarf rotation rates. The Tayler-Spruit dynamo is unable to provide\nenough transport of angular momentum to reach the observed values of the core\nhelium burning stars investigated in this paper. We find that a value for the\nadditional artificial viscosity $\\nu_{\\rm{add}}$ around 10$^7$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$\nprovides enough transport of angular momentum. However, the rotational period\nof these models is too high in the white dwarf phase to match the white dwarf\nobservations.

We use a modified version\nof Turbospectrum and consider the presence of a gaseous circumstellar envelope\nand radial wind. The new Li abundances derived with the pseudo-dynamical models\nare very similar to those obtained from hydrostatic models (the average\ndifference is 0.18 dex), with no difference for Ca. The Li and Ca content in\nthese stars is only slightly affected by the presence of a circumstellar\nenvelope.

There is a need to\nunderstand tradeoffs between bitrate and perception performance. In this paper,\nwe compare the image compression standards JPEG, JPEG2000, and WebP to a modern\nencoder/decoder image compression approach based on generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs). We evaluate both the pure compression performance using\ntypical metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural\nsimilarity (SSIM) and others, but also the performance of a subsequent\nperception function, namely a semantic segmentation (characterized by the mean\nintersection over union (mIoU) measure). Not surprisingly, for all investigated\ncompression methods, a higher bitrate means better results in all investigated\nquality metrics. Interestingly, however, we show that the semantic segmentation\nmIoU of the GAN autoencoder in the highly relevant low-bitrate regime (at\n0.0625 bit/pixel) is better by 3.9% absolute than JPEG2000, although the latter\nstill is considerably better in terms of PSNR (5.91 dB difference). This effect\ncan greatly be enlarged by training the semantic segmentation model with images\noriginating from the decoder, so that the mIoU using the segmentation model\ntrained by GAN reconstructions exceeds the use of the model trained with\noriginal images by almost 20% absolute. We conclude that distributed perception\nin future autonomous driving will most probably not provide a solution to the\nautomotive bus capacity bottleneck by using standard compression schemes such\nas JPEG2000, but requires modern coding approaches, with the GAN\nencoder/decoder method being a promising candidate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 10:09:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

Among them, the\nconcept of envy-freeness up to any item (EFX) is arguably the closest to\nenvy-freeness. Unfortunately, EFX allocations are not known to exist except in\na few special cases. We make significant progress in this direction. We show\nthat for every instance with additive valuations, there is an EFX allocation of\na subset of items with a Nash welfare that is at least half of the maximum\npossible Nash welfare for the original set of items. That is, after donating\nsome items to a charity, one can distribute the remaining items in a fair way\nwith high efficiency. This bound is proved to be best possible. Our proof is\nconstructive and highlights the importance of maximum Nash welfare allocation.\nStarting with such an allocation, our algorithm decides which items to donate\nand redistributes the initial bundles to the agents, eventually obtaining an\nallocation with the claimed efficiency guarantee. The application of our\nalgorithm to large markets, where the valuations of an agent for every item is\nrelatively small, yields EFX with almost optimal Nash welfare. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first use of large market assumptions in the fair\ndivision literature. We also show that our algorithm can be modified to\ncompute, in polynomial-time, EFX allocations that approximate optimal Nash\nwelfare within a factor of at most $2\\rho$, using a $\\rho$-approximate\nallocation on input instead of the maximum Nash welfare one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 10:35:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

Unfortunately, long reads have high sequencing\nerror rates and a large proportion of bps in these long reads are incorrectly\nidentified.

Assembly polishing algorithms minimize such error propagation\nby polishing or fixing errors in the assembly by using information from\nalignments between reads and the assembly (i.e., read-to-assembly alignment\ninformation).

Thus, how to select an appropriate and\nreliable customer while not disclosing processors' privacy has become an\ninteresting problem. In this article, we present a trust-based and\nprivacy-preserving customer selection scheme in ubiquitous computing, called\nTPCS, to enable potential processors select the customers with good reputation.\nThe basic concept of TPCS is that each data processor holds a trust value, and\nthe reputation score of the customer is calculated based on processors' trust\nvalues and feedbacks via a truth discovery process. To preserve processors'\nprivacy, pseudonyms and Paillier cryptosystem are applied to conceal each\nprocessor's real identity.

However, the task scheduling of computation offloading in\nedge-clouds faces a two-fold challenge.

However, under ambient conditions, a\ndelicate control of the moisture level in the atmosphere has to be enforced to\nachieve efficient and highly stable devices. In this work, we show that it is\nthe absolute content of water measured in the form of partial water vapour\npressure (WVP) the only determining control parameter that needs to be\nconsidered during preparation. Following this perspective, MAPbI3 perovskite\nfilms were deposited under different WVP by changing the relative humidity (RH)\nand the lab temperature. We found that efficient and reproducible devices can\nbe obtained at given values of WVP. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that small\ntemperature changes, at the same value of the RH, result in huge changes in\nperformance, due to the non-linear dependence of the WVP on temperature. We\nhave extended the procedure to accomplish high-efficient FA0.83MA0.17PbI3\ndevices at ambient conditions by adjusting DMSO proportion in precursor\nsolution as a function of WVP only. As an example of the relevance of this\nparamater, a WVP value of around of 1.6 kPa appears to be an upper limit for\nsafe fabrication of high efficiency devices at ambient conditions, regardless\nthe RH and lab temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 12:56:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

Systems in which disorder\ncompetes with interactions and transport can violate this expectation by\nexhibiting many-body localization. The strength of the disorder with respect to\nthe other two parameters drives a transition from a thermalizing system towards\na non-thermalizing one. The existence of this transition is well established\nboth in experimental and numerical studies for finite systems. However, the\nstability of many-body localization in the thermodynamic limit is largely\nunclear. With increasing system size, a generic disordered system will contain\nwith high probability areas of low disorder variation. If large and frequent\nenough, those areas constitute ergodic grains which can hybridize and thus\ncompete with localization.

Hence, the human visual system\nhas evolved to be more sensitive to contrast than absolute luminance. This\nfeature is equally desired for machine vision: the ability to recognise\npatterns even when aspects of them are transformed due to variation in local\nand global contrast. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the impact of\nimage contrast on prominent deep convolutional networks, both during the\ntraining and testing phase. The results of conducted experiments testify to an\nevident deterioration in the accuracy of all state-of-the-art networks at\nlow-contrast images. We demonstrate that \"contrast-augmentation\" is a\nsufficient condition to endow a network with invariance to contrast. This\npractice shows no negative side effects, quite the contrary, it might allow a\nmodel to refrain from other illuminance related over-fittings. This ability can\nalso be achieved by a short fine-tuning procedure, which opens new lines of\ninvestigation on mechanisms involved in two networks whose weights are over\n99.9% correlated, yet astonishingly produce utterly different outcomes. Our\nfurther analysis suggests that the optimisation algorithm is an influential\nfactor, however with a significantly lower effect; and while the choice of an\narchitecture manifests a negligible impact on this phenomenon, the first layers\nappear to be more critical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 13:35:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

Typically, the training phase of machine learning techniques requires\nto process large-scale datasets which may contain private and sensitive\ninformation of customers. This imposes significant security risks since modern\nonline services rely on cloud computing to store and process the sensitive\ndata. In the untrusted computing infrastructure, security is becoming a\nparamount concern since the customers need to trust the thirdparty cloud\nprovider. Unfortunately, this trust has been violated multiple times in the\npast. To overcome the potential security risks in the cloud, we answer the\nfollowing research question: how to enable secure executions of machine\nlearning computations in the untrusted infrastructure? To achieve this goal, we\npropose a hardware-assisted approach based on Trusted Execution Environments\n(TEEs), specifically Intel SGX, to enable secure execution of the machine\nlearning computations over the private and sensitive datasets. More\nspecifically, we propose a generic and secure machine learning framework based\non Tensorflow, which enables secure execution of existing applications on the\ncommodity untrusted infrastructure. In particular, we have built our system\ncalled TensorSCONE from ground-up by integrating TensorFlow with SCONE, a\nshielded execution framework based on Intel SGX. The main challenge of this\nwork is to overcome the architectural limitations of Intel SGX in the context\nof building a secure TensorFlow system. Our evaluation shows that we achieve\nreasonable performance overheads while providing strong security properties\nwith low TCB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 14:48:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

The ESA/Rosetta mission to\ncomet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) provides a unique opportunity to study\ncharge-changing processes in situ. To understand the role of these reactions in\nthe evolution of the solar wind plasma, and interpret the complex in-situ\nmeasurements made by Rosetta, numerical or analytical models are necessary. We\nuse an extended analytical formalism describing solar wind charge-changing\nprocesses at comets along solar wind streamlines. The model is driven by solar\nwind ion measurements from the Rosetta Plasma Consortium-Ion Composition\nAnalyzer (RPC-ICA) and neutral density observations from the Rosetta\nSpectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis-Comet Pressure Sensor (ROSINA-COPS),\nas well as charge-changing cross sections of hydrogen and helium particles in a\nwater gas. A mission-wide overview of charge-changing efficiencies at comet 67P\nis presented. Electron capture cross sections dominate and favor the production\nof He and H energetic neutral atoms, with fluxes expected to rival those of H+\nand He2+ ions. Neutral outgassing rates are retrieved from local RPC-ICA flux\nmeasurements, and match ROSINA's estimates very well. From the model, we find\nthat solar wind charge exchange is unable to fully explain the magnitude of the\nsharp drop of solar wind ion fluxes observed by Rosetta for heliocentric\ndistances below 2.5 AU. This is likely because the model does not take into\naccount the relative ion dynamics and, to a lesser extent, ignore the formation\nof bow shock-like structures upstream of the nucleus.

Although\nthe real-time air quality report can be utilized to update our knowledge on air\nquality, questions about how pollutants evolve across time and how pollutants\nare spatially correlated still remain a puzzle. In view of this point, we adopt\nthe PMFG network method to analyze the six pollutants' hourly data in 350\nChinese cities in an attempt to find out how these pollutants are correlated\ntemporally and spatially. In terms of time dimension, the results indicate\nthat, except for O$_3$, the pollutants have a common feature of the strong\nintraday patterns of which the daily variations are composed of two contraction\nperiods and two expansion periods. Besides, all the time series of the six\npollutants possess strong long-term correlations, and this temporal memory\neffect helps to explain why smoggy days are always followed by one after\nanother. In terms of space dimension, the correlation structure shows that\nO$_3$ is characterized by the highest spatial connections. The PMFGs reveal the\nrelationship between this spatial correlation and provincial administrative\ndivisions by filtering the hierarchical structure in the correlation matrix and\nrefining the cliques as the tinny spatial clusters. Finally, we check the\nstability of the correlation structure and conclude that, except for PM$_{10}$\nand O$_3$, the other pollutants have an overall stable correlation, and all\npollutants have a slight trend to become more divergent in space.

We explore the problem in a way\nthat avoids assumptions about the intent and motivation of any exo-civilization\nseeking to settle other planetary systems. We first consider the speed of an\nadvancing settlement via probes of finite velocity and range to determine if\nthe galaxy can become inhabited with space-faring civilizations on timescales\nshorter than its age. We also include the effect of stellar motions on the long\nterm behavior of the settlement front which adds a diffusive component to its\nadvance. The results of these models demonstrate that the Milky Way can be\nreadily 'filled-in' with settled stellar systems under conservative assumptions\nabout interstellar spacecraft velocities and launch rates. We then consider the\nquestion of the galactic steady-state achieved in terms of the fraction of\nsettled planets. We do this by considering the effect of finite settlement\ncivilization lifetimes on the steady states. We find a range of parameters for\nwhich the galaxy supports a population of interstellar space-faring\ncivilizations even though some settleable systems are uninhabited. Both results\npoint to ways in which Earth might remain unvisited in the midst of an\ninhabited galaxy.

In this article, we consider such\nmixtures of two superfluids with unequal synthetic charges in a ring trap\nsubject to a uniform artificial magnetic field. The charge imbalance in such a\nmixture changes the distribution of excited particles over angular momentum\nstates compared to that of an equally charged mixture.

Most traditional TOuU methods use gradient-based optimization\nalgorithms and rely on accurate estimates of the statistical moments and their\ngradients, e.g., via adjoint calculations. When the number of uncertain inputs\nis large or the quantities of interest exhibit large variability, a large\nnumber of adjoint (and/or forward) solves may be required to ensure the\naccuracy of these gradients. The optimization procedure itself often requires a\nlarge number of iterations, which may render TOuU computationally expensive, if\nnot infeasible. To tackle this difficulty, we here propose an optimization\napproach that generates a stochastic approximation of the objective,\nconstraints, and their gradients via a small number of adjoint (and/or forward)\nsolves, per iteration. A statistically independent (stochastic) approximation\nof these quantities is generated at each optimization iteration. The total cost\nof this approach is only a small factor larger than that of the corresponding\ndeterministic TO problem. We incorporate the stochastic approximation of\nobjective, constraints and their design sensitivities into two classes of\noptimization algorithms.

This finding enables achieving an optimal solution in feasible\ntime by converting a two dimensional uncountable state Markov decision process\n(MDP) with continuous action space into a countable state MDP with binary\ndecision space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 06:55:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-14"}

Previous recommendation models mainly focused\non user's general interests to find the right products. However, the aspect of\nmeeting users' demands at the right time has been much less explored. To\naddress this problem, we propose a novel Long-Short Demands-aware Model (LSDM),\nin which both user's interests towards items and user's demands over time are\nincorporated. We summarize two aspects: termed as long-time demands (e.g.,\npurchasing the same product repetitively showing a long-time persistent\ninterest) and short-time demands (e.g., co-purchase like buying paintbrushes\nafter pigments). To utilize such long-short demands of users, we create\ndifferent clusters to group the successive product purchases together according\nto different time spans, and use recurrent neural networks to model each\nsequence of clusters at a time scale. The long-short purchase demands with\nmulti-time scales are finally aggregated by joint learning strategies.\nExperimental results on three real-world commerce datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our model for next-item recommendation, showing the usefulness\nof modeling users' long-short purchase demands of items with multi-time scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 07:41:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-04"}
