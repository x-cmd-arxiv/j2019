To carry out a clinical research under\nthis scenario, an analyst could train a machine learning model only on local\ndata site, but it is still possible to execute a statistical query at a certain\ncost in the form of sending a machine learning model to some of the remote data\nsites and get the performance measures as feedback, maybe due to prediction\nbeing usually much cheaper. Compared to federated learning, which is optimizing\nthe model parameters directly by carrying out training across all data sites,\nRFMS trains model parameters only on one local data site but optimizes\nhyper-parameters across other data sites jointly since hyper-parameters play an\nimportant role in machine learning performance. The aim is to get a Pareto\noptimal model with respective to both local and remote unseen prediction\nlosses, which could generalize well across data sites.

In such scenarios, the received signal is corrupted by an\ninterfering signal which is typically cyclostationary in continuous-time. If\nthe period of interference is synchronized with the sampling period, the\nsampled interference is a discrete-time (DT) cyclostationary process. However,\nin the common interference scenario, the period of the interference is not\nnecessarily synchronized with the sampling period. In such cases, the DT\ninterference is an almost cyclostationary process. In this work we characterize\nthe capacity of channels in which the noise arises from a sampled\ncyclostationary Gaussian process. For the case of synchronous sampling,\ncapacity can be obtained in closed form. When sampling is not synchronized with\nthe symbol rate of the interference, the resulting channel is not information\nstable, thus classic tools are not applicable. Using information spectrum\nmethods, we prove that capacity can be obtained as the limit of a sequence of\ncapacities of channels with cyclostationary noise.

The exact lattice models involve interactions over long distances,\nwhich is difficult to realize in experiments. It seems, however, that such\nlong-range interactions should not be necessary, as the correlations decay\nexponentially in the bulk. This poses the question, whether the Hamiltonians\ncan be truncated to contain only local interactions without changing the\nphysics of the ground state. Previous studies have in a couple of cases with\nparticularly much symmetry obtained such local Hamiltonians by keeping only a\nfew local terms and numerically optimizing the coefficients. Here, we\ninvestigate a different strategy to construct truncated Hamiltonians, which\ndoes not rely on optimization, and which can be applied independent of the\nchoice of lattice. We test the approach on two models with bosonic\nLaughlin-like ground states with filling factor $1/2$ and $1/4$, respectively.\nWe first investigate how the coupling strengths in the exact Hamiltonians\ndepend on distance, and then we study the truncated models. For the case of\n$1/2$ filling, we find that the truncated model with truncation radius\n$\\sqrt{2}$ lattice constants on the square lattice and $1$ lattice constant on\nthe triangular lattice has an approximate twofold ground state degeneracy on\nthe torus, and the overlap per site between these states and the states\nconstructed from conformal field theory is higher than $0.99$ for the lattices\nconsidered.

The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes\nthat neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their\nrepresentations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task.\nHowever, empirical evidence for this theory is conflicting, as compression was\nonly observed when networks used saturating activation functions. In contrast,\nnetworks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of\ntask performance but did not show compression. In this paper we developed more\nrobust mutual information estimation techniques, that adapt to hidden activity\nof neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from\nall functions, especially unbounded functions. Using these adaptive estimation\ntechniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different\nactivation functions. With two improved methods of estimation, firstly, we show\nthat saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and\nthe amount of compression varies between different activation functions. We\nalso find that there is a large amount of variation in compression between\ndifferent network initializations. Secondary, we see that L2 regularization\nleads to significantly increased compression, while preventing overfitting.\nFinally, we show that only compression of the last layer is positively\ncorrelated with generalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2019 23:41:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 22:42:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-03"}

These limitations are typically related to\nboth the (iterative) storing of the associated tensors and to the computational\ntime related to their multiple contractions in the calculation of various\nquantities of interest. However, not all the degrees of freedom encapsulated\ninto these tensors equally contribute to the description of many-body\nobservables. Identifying systematic and dominating patterns, a relevant\nobjective is to achieve an \\emph{a priori} reduction to the most relevant\ndegrees of freedom via a pre-processing of the A-body problem. The present\npaper is dedicated to the analysis of two different paradigms to do so. The\nfactorization of tensors in terms of lower-rank ones, whose know-how has been\nrecently transferred to the realm of nuclear structure, is compared to a\nreduction of the tensors' index size based on an importance truncation. While\nthe objective is to eventually utilize these pre-processing tools in the\ncontext of non-perturbative many-body methods, benchmark calculations are\npresently performed within the frame of perturbation theory.

This extended perturbation theory serves as a jumpstart for\nnon-perturbative Bogoliubov coupled cluster and Gorkov self-consistent Green's\nfunction theories.

Finite volume approximations employ this\nviewpoint, and the present paper can be regarded as being in this category. It\nis first shown that under very mild conditions a weak solution is indeed a\nsolution to the balance law. The schemes considered here allow the computation\nof several quantities per mesh cell (e.g., slopes) and the notion of\nconsistency must be extended to this framework.

We use the Hamiltonian constraint\nto determine the pointwise conditions required for an overdensity to reach its\nturnaround epoch in an exactly flat spatial domain. We illustrate this with a\nplane-symmetric, exact, cosmological solution of the Einstein equation,\nextending earlier work. More generally, for a standard initial power spectrum,\nwe use the relativistic Zel'dovich approximation implemented in 'inhomog' to\nnumerically estimate how much positive spatial curvature is required for\nturnaround to be allowed at typical epochs/length scales in almost-EdS and\nalmost-LCDM models with inhomogeneous curvature.

The CFD-driven training is an\nextension of the gene expression programming method (Weatheritt and Sandberg,\n2016), but crucially the fitness of candidate models is now evaluated by\nrunning RANS calculations in an integrated way, rather than using an algebraic\nfunction. Unlike other data-driven methods that fit the Reynolds stresses of\ntrained models to high-fidelity data, the cost function for the CFD-driven\ntraining can be defined based on any flow feature from the CFD results. This\nextends the applicability of the method especially when the training data is\nlimited. Furthermore, the resulting model, which is the one providing the most\naccurate CFD results at the end of the training, inherently shows good\nperformance in RANS calculations. To demonstrate the potential of this new\nmethod, the CFD-driven machine learning approach is applied to model\ndevelopment for wake mixing in turbomachines. A new model is trained based on a\nhigh-pressure turbine case and then tested for three additional cases, all\nrepresentative of modern turbine nozzles. Despite the geometric configurations\nand operating conditions being different among the cases, the predicted wake\nmixing profiles are significantly improved in all of these a posteriori tests.\nMoreover, the model equation is explicitly given and available for analysis,\nthus it could be deduced that the enhanced wake prediction is predominantly due\nto the extra diffusion introduced by the CFD-driven model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 03:40:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 14:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-27"}

IPFS is a distributed web based on a\npeer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open\nand focuses on public accessible files. To provide a solution for private file\nstorage in the blockchain way, in this paper we propose a Merkle-tree-based\nFile System (MTFS). In MTFS, the blockchain is more than a trust machine; it is\nan abstract of a cluster system. Distributed random nodes form a tree network\ncluster without a central controller to provide a secure private storage\nservice and faster message propagation.

Merkle tree\nwill make sure that the files are distributed among the service nodes in a\nbalanced way.

However, the prevalent semantic edge detection\nmethods apply a fixed weight fusion strategy where images with different\nsemantics are forced to share the same weights, resulting in universal fusion\nweights for all images and locations regardless of their different semantics or\nlocal context. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic feature fusion strategy\nthat assigns different fusion weights for different input images and locations\nadaptively. This is achieved by a proposed weight learner to infer proper\nfusion weights over multi-level features for each location of the feature map,\nconditioned on the specific input. In this way, the heterogeneity in\ncontributions made by different locations of feature maps and input images can\nbe better considered and thus help produce more accurate and sharper edge\npredictions.

For most solid-state qubit technologies, e.g. those using\nsuperconducting circuits or semiconductor spins, scaling poses a significant\nchallenge as every additional qubit increases the heat generated, while the\ncooling power of dilution refrigerators is severely limited at their operating\ntemperature below 100 mK. Here we demonstrate operation of a scalable silicon\nquantum processor unit cell, comprising two qubits confined to quantum dots\n(QDs) at $\\sim$1.5 Kelvin. We achieve this by isolating the QDs from the\nelectron reservoir, initialising and reading the qubits solely via tunnelling\nof electrons between the two QDs. We coherently control the qubits using\nelectrically-driven spin resonance (EDSR) in isotopically enriched silicon\n$^{28}$Si, attaining single-qubit gate fidelities of 98.6% and coherence time\n$T_2^*$ = 2$\\mu$s during `hot' operation, comparable to those of spin qubits in\nnatural silicon at millikelvin temperatures. Furthermore, we show that the unit\ncell can be operated at magnetic fields as low as 0.1 T, corresponding to a\nqubit control frequency of 3.5 GHz, where the qubit energy is well below the\nthermal energy. The unit cell constitutes the core building block of a\nfull-scale silicon quantum computer, and satisfies layout constraints required\nby error correction architectures.

A typical\nautomatic short answer grading system (ASAG) grades student answers across\nmultiple domains (or subjects). Grading student answers requires building a\nsupervised machine learning model that evaluates the similarity of the student\nanswer with the reference answer(s). We observe that unlike typical textual\nsimilarity or entailment tasks, the notion of similarity is not universal here.\nOn one hand, para-phrasal constructs of the language can indicate similarity\nindependent of the domain. On the other hand, two words, or phrases, that are\nnot strict synonyms of each other, might mean the same in certain domains.\nBuilding on this observation, we propose JMD-ASAG, the first joint multidomain\ndeep learning architecture for automatic short answer grading that performs\ndomain adaptation by learning generic and domain-specific aspects from the\nlimited domain-wise training data. JMD-ASAG not only learns the domain-specific\ncharacteristics but also overcomes the dependence on a large corpus by learning\nthe generic characteristics from the task-specific data itself. On a\nlarge-scale industry dataset and a benchmarking dataset, we show that our model\nperforms significantly better than existing techniques which either learn\ndomain-specific models or adapt a generic similarity scoring model from a large\ncorpus. Further, on the benchmarking dataset, we report state-of-the-art\nresults against all existing non-neural and neural models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 10:31:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-26"}

In reality, however, messages\nare not immutable, but may be morphed with every step, potentially entailing\nlarge cumulative distortions. This process may lead to misinformation even in\nthe absence of malevolent actors, and understanding it is crucial for modeling\nand improving online information systems. Here, we perform a controlled,\ncrowdsourced experiment in which we simulate the propagation of information\nfrom medical research papers. Starting from the original abstracts, crowd\nworkers iteratively shorten previously produced summaries to increasingly\nsmaller lengths. We also collect control summaries where the original abstract\nis compressed directly to the final target length. Comparing cascades to\ncontrols allows us to separate the effect of the length constraint from that of\naccumulated distortion. Via careful manual coding, we annotate lexical and\nsemantic units in the medical abstracts and track them along cascades. We find\nthat iterative summarization has a negative impact due to the accumulation of\nerror, but that high-quality intermediate summaries result in less distorted\nmessages than in the control case. Different types of information behave\ndifferently; in particular, the conclusion of a medical abstract (i.e., its key\nmessage) is distorted most. Finally, we compare abstractive with extractive\nsummaries, finding that the latter are less prone to semantic distortion.\nOverall, this work is a first step in studying information cascades without the\nassumption that disseminated content is immutable, with implications on our\nunderstanding of the role of word-of-mouth effects on the misreporting of\nscience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 11:20:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 23:36:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}

The modeling of the QCD medium is based on a\nquasiparticle description where the medium effects have been encoded in the\neffective quarks, antiquarks and gluons. The temperature dependence of the\nlinear longitudinal current density (in terms of the electric field) and the\nadditional components of current density due to the inhomogeneity of electric\nfield (in terms of its derivatives) have been obtained by solving the\n$(1+1)-$dimensional effective covariant kinetic theory with a proper collision\nterm.

Recently, the\nconcept of single orbital-manifold band inversions occurring along\nhigh-symmetry lines has been demonstrated, stabilising multiple bulk and\nsurface Dirac fermions. Here, we discuss the underlying ingredients necessary\nto achieve such phases, and discuss their existence within the family of\ntransition metal dichalcogenides. We show how their three-dimensional band\nstructures naturally produce only small $k_z$ projected band gaps, and\ndemonstrate how these play a significant role in shaping the surface electronic\nstructure of these materials. We demonstrate, through spin- and angle-resolved\nphotoemission and density functional theory calculations, how the surface\nelectronic structures of the group-X TMDs PtSe$_2$ and PdTe$_2$ are host to up\nto five distinct surface states, each with complex band dispersions and spin\ntextures. Finally, we discuss how the origin of several recently-realised\ninstances of topological phenomena in systems outside of the TMDs, including\nthe iron-based superconductors, can be understood as a consequence of the same\nunderlying mechanism driving $k_z$-mediated band inversions in the TMDs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 11:52:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-26"}

Most existing methods recover\nhigh-resolution representations from low-resolution representations produced by\na high-to-low resolution network. Instead, our proposed network maintains\nhigh-resolution representations through the whole process. We start from a\nhigh-resolution subnetwork as the first stage, gradually add high-to-low\nresolution subnetworks one by one to form more stages, and connect the\nmutli-resolution subnetworks in parallel. We conduct repeated multi-scale\nfusions such that each of the high-to-low resolution representations receives\ninformation from other parallel representations over and over, leading to rich\nhigh-resolution representations. As a result, the predicted keypoint heatmap is\npotentially more accurate and spatially more precise.

Recent\nresearch focused on many-body localized (MBL) systems, characterized by new\nkind of integrability, and by the area-law entanglement of eigenstates. We\ninvestigate the effect of a non-Abelian $SU(2)$ symmetry on the dynamical\nproperties of a disordered Heisenberg chain. While $SU(2)$ symmetry is\ninconsistent with the conventional MBL, a new non-ergodic regime is possible.\nIn this regime, the eigenstates exhibit faster than area-law, but still a\nstrongly sub-thermal scaling of entanglement entropy. Using exact\ndiagonalization, we establish that this non-ergodic regime is indeed realized\nin the strongly disordered Heisenberg chains. We use real-space renormalization\ngroup (RSRG) to construct approximate excited eigenstates, and show their\naccuracy for systems of size up to $L=26$. As disorder strength is decreased, a\ncrossover to the thermalizing phase occurs. To establish the ultimate fate of\nthe non-ergodic regime in the thermodynamic limit, we develop a novel approach\nfor describing many-body processes that are usually neglected by RSRG,\naccessing systems of size $L>2000$. We characterize the resonances that arise\ndue to such processes, finding that they involve an ever growing number of\nspins as the system size is increased. The probability of finding resonances\ngrows with the system size. Even at strong disorder, we can identify a large\nlengthscale beyond which resonances proliferate. Presumably, this eventually\nwould drive the system to a thermalizing phase. However, the extremely long\nthermalization time scales indicate that a broad non-ergodic regime will be\nobservable experimentally. Our study demonstrates that symmetries control\ndynamical properties of disordered, many-body systems. The approach introduced\nhere provides a versatile tool for describing a broad range of disordered\nmany-body systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 12:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

Iris is believed to belong to the category of large unfragmented\nasteroids that avoided internal differentiation, implying that its current\nshape and topography may record the first few 100 Myr of the solar system's\ncollisional evolution. We recovered information about the shape and surface\ntopography of Iris from disk-resolved VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL images acquired in the\nframe of our ESO large program. We used the All-Data Asteroid Modeling (ADAM)\nshape reconstruction algorithm to model the 3D shape of Iris, using optical\ndisk-integrated data and disk-resolved images from SPHERE as inputs. We\nanalyzed the SPHERE images to infer the asteroid's global shape and the\nmorphology of its main craters. We present the volume-equivalent diameter\nD$_{{\\rm eq}}$=214$\\pm$5 km, and bulk density $\\rho$=2.7$\\pm$0.3 g cm$^{-3}$ of\nIris.

Craters on Iris have depth-to-diameter ratios that are similar to\nthose of analogous 10 km craters on Vesta. The bulk density of Iris is\nconsistent with that of its meteoritic analog, namely LL ordinary chondrites.\nConsidering the absence of a collisional family related to Iris and the number\nof large craters on its surface, we suggest that its equatorial depression may\nbe the remnant of an ancient (at least 3 Gyr) impact. Iris's shape further\nopens the possibility that large planetesimals formed as almost perfect oblate\nspheroids.

It is a\nchallenging task because accurate traffic volumes on the roads can only be\nmeasured at certain locations where sensors are installed. Moreover, the\ntraffic evolves over time due to the influences of weather, events, holidays,\netc. Existing solutions to the traffic volume inference problem often rely on\ndense GPS trajectories, which inevitably fail to account for the vehicles which\ncarry no GPS devices or have them turned off.

Our approach employs a high-fidelity\ntraffic simulator and deep reinforcement learning to recover full vehicle\nmovements from the incomplete trajectories.

Such a coupling gives rise to Fano-Feshbach resonances\n(FFR) that have become key to understanding and controlling interactions - in\nultracold atomic gases, but also between quasiparticles such as microcavity\npolaritons. The energy positions of FFR were shown to follow quantum chaotic\nstatistics. In contrast, lifetimes which are the fundamental property of a\ndecaying state, have so far escaped a similarly comprehensive understanding.\nHere we show that a bound state, despite being resonantly coupled to a\nscattering state, becomes protected from decay whenever the relative phase is a\nmultiple of $\\pi$.

In this paper, a finite level ($N$)\nsurface defined by the binary coding of the orbit is considered over the\ninitial value domain $D_0$. It is proved that a tiling of $D_0$ by base ribbons\nof the surface steps is proper; the surface height increases monotonously when\nribbons are traversed from left to right. The mechanism of level $N+1$ tiling\ncreation from $N$ one is clarified. Two cases are possible depending on the\ncode and the anisotropy. (A) Every ribbon shrinks to a line at $N \\rightarrow\n\\infty$. Here the uniqueness holds. (B) When future (F) and past (P) ribbon\nbecome tangent each other, they escape from shrinking, Then, the initial values\nof a stable PO ($S$) and an unstable PO ($U$) sharing the same code co-exist\ninside the overlap of F and P non-shrinking ribbons. This case corresponds to\nBroucke's PO. At high anisotropy, it is only case (A), but with decreasing\nanisotropy, bifurcation $U(R) \\rightarrow S(R) +U'(NR)$ occurs, along with the\nemergence of a non-shrinking ribbon. (Here $R$ and $NR$ are short for\nself-retracing and non-retracing PO respectively).

Only one location of a moon at\n0.63AU (corresponding to a 2:1 MMR) was found to form a gap at 0.4AU over short\ntime periods of less than 100yr. However, the proximity of a low mass moon\n(0.08 Earth masses) caused significant scattering of the outer ring edge at\n0.6AU, along with the formation of an additional gap at the 3:2 MMR (0.485 AU),\nwhich is not consistent with observations. Further models with moons located at\nMMR 3:1, 4:1, 7:3 and 5:3 failed to form gaps at 0.4AU for time periods less\nthan 100yr. Instead, gaps were formed in the ring at 3:2 and 2:1 MMR which\nresulted in gaps at radial locations between 0.44-0.56AU. Additionally, gaps\nalso take longer than one orbital period of J1407b about the primary to form.\nGiven that J1407b is on a highly eccentric orbit and is thought to strongly\nperturb the ring at apocentre it appears unlikely that gaps form due to MMR\nwith nearby moons as opposed to embedded moons. Including an appropriate total\nmass of the ring equal to Earth a dampening effect was witnessed on the gap\nformation process, causing an increase in the time required to open a gap due\nto MMR.

Transactional Causal Consistency (TCC) is an attractive\nconsistency level for building such platforms. TCC avoids many anomalies of\neventual consistency, eschews the synchronization costs of strong consistency,\nand supports interactive read-write transactions. Partial replication is\nanother attractive design choice for building geo-replicated platforms, as it\nincreases the storage capacity and reduces update propagation costs. This paper\npresents PaRiS, the first TCC system that supports partial replication and\nimplements non-blocking parallel read operations, whose latency is paramount\nfor the performance of read-intensive applications. PaRiS relies on a novel\nprotocol to track dependencies, called Universal Stable Time (UST).

Hence, transactions can\nconsistently read from such a snapshot on any server in any replication site\nwithout having to block.

Here, we present a theory for the optimal design of\na large class of sensing systems that need to detect time-varying signals, a\nreceptor driving a push-pull network. The theory is based on the concept of the\ndynamic input-output relation, which describes the mapping between the current\nligand concentration and the average receptor occupancy over the past\nintegration time. This concept is used to develop the idea that the cell\nemploys its push-pull network to estimate the receptor occupancy and then uses\nthis estimate to infer the current ligand concentration by inverting the\ndynamic input-output relation. The theory reveals that the sensing error can be\ndecomposed into two terms: the sampling error in the estimate of the receptor\noccupancy and the dynamical error that arises because the average ligand\nconcentration over the past integration time may not reflect the current ligand\nconcentration. The theory generalizes the design principle of optimal resource\nallocation previously identified for static signals, which states that in an\noptimally designed sensing system the three fundamental resource classes of\nreceptors and their integration time, readout molecules, and energy are equally\nlimiting so that no resource is wasted. However, in contrast to static signals,\nreceptors and power cannot be traded freely against time to reach a desired\nsensing precision: there exists an optimal integration time that maximizes the\nsensing precision, which depends on the number of receptors, the receptor\ncorrelation time, and the correlation time and variance of the input signal.\nApplying our theory to the chemotaxis system of Escherichia coli indicates that\nthis bacterium has evolved to optimally sense shallow gradients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 15:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-26"}

The usage of human-readable models allows them to explain the\nreasoning behind their predictions and decisions. However, when it comes to Big\nData classification problems, fuzzy rule-based classifiers have not been able\nto maintain the good trade-off between accuracy and interpretability that has\ncharacterized these techniques in non-Big Data environments. The most accurate\nmethods build too complex models composed of a large number of rules and fuzzy\nsets, while those approaches focusing on interpretability do not provide\nstate-of-the-art discrimination capabilities. In this paper, we propose a new\ndistributed learning algorithm named CFM-BD to construct accurate and compact\nfuzzy rule-based classification systems for Big Data.

The lifetime and evolution of\nsuch a differentially rotating star, is tightly related to the observations in\nthe post-merger phase. Various studies on the maximum mass of differentially\nrotating neutron stars have been done in the past, most of which assume the\nso-called $j$-const law as the rotation profile inside the star and consider\nonly neutron star equations of state. In this paper, we extend the studies to\nstrange star models, as well as to a new rotation profile model. Significant\ndifferences are found between differentially rotating strange stars and neutron\nstars, with both differential rotation laws. A moderate differential rotation\nrate for neutron stars is found to be too large for strange stars, resulting in\na rapid drop in the maximum mass as the differential rotation degree is\nincreased further from $\\hat{A}\\sim2.0$, where $\\hat{A}$ is a parameter\ncharacterizing the differential rotation rate for $j$-const law. As a result\nthe maximum mass of a differentially rotating self-bound star drops below the\nuniformly rotating mass shedding limit for a reasonable degree of differential\nrotation. The continuous transition to the toroidal sequence is also found to\nhappen at a much smaller differential rotation rate and angular momentum than\nfor neutron stars.

The dislocations between quintuple layers present special interest\nsince their core structure is controlled by the van der Waals interactions\nbetween the layers. In this work, using atomic-resolution electron microscopy,\nwe resolve the basal dislocation core structure in Bi_{2}Te_{3}, quantifying\nthe disregistry of the atomic planes across the core. We show that, despite the\nexistence of a stable stacking fault in the basal plane gamma surface, the\ndislocation core spreading is mainly due to the weak bonding between the\nlayers, which leads to a small energy penalty for layer sliding parallel to the\nvan der Waals gap.

This\ngap hampers our understanding of the influence of clonality on evolutionary\ntrajectories and the interpretation of population genetics data. We performed\nforward simulations of diploid populations at increasing rates of clonality\n(c), analysed their relationships with genotypic (clonal richness, R, and\ndistribution of clonal sizes, Pareto \\beta) and genetic (FIS and linkage\ndisequilibrium) indices, and tested predictions of c from population genetics\ndata through supervised machine learning. Two complementary behaviours emerged\nfrom the probability distributions of genotypic and genetic indices with\nincreasing c. While the impact of c on R and Pareto \\beta was easily described\nby simple mathematical equations, its effects on genetic indices were\nnoticeable only at the highest levels (c>0.95). Consequently, genotypic indices\nallowed reliable estimates of c, while genetic descriptors led to poorer\nperformances when c<0.95. These results provide clear baseline expectations for\ngenotypic and genetic diversity and dynamics under partial clonality.\nWorryingly, however, the use of realistic sample sizes to acquire empirical\ndata systematically led to gross underestimates (often of one to two orders of\nmagnitude) of c, suggesting that many interpretations hitherto proposed in the\nliterature, mostly based on genotypic richness, should be reappraised. We\npropose future avenues to derive realistic confidence intervals for c and show\nthat, although still approximate, a supervised learning method would greatly\nimprove the estimation of c from population genetics data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 15:29:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 22:26:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 19:13:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 3 Aug 2019 09:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}

The conjunctivist framework - primarily developed by\nPietroski (2005, 2018) - obtains expressive representations with only a few\nbasic semantic types and relations systematically linked to syntactic\npositions. While representational simplicity is crucial for computational\napplications, such findings have not yet had major influence on NLP. We present\nthe first generic semantic representation format for NLP directly based on\nthese insights. We name the format EAT due to its basis in the Event-, Agent-,\nand Theme arguments in Neo-Davidsonian logical forms. It builds on the idea\nthat similar tripartite argument relations are ubiquitous across categories,\nand can be constructed from grammatical structure without additional lexical\ninformation. We present a detailed exposition of EAT and how it relates to\nother prevalent formats used in prior work, such as Abstract Meaning\nRepresentation (AMR) and Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS). EAT stands out in\ntwo respects: simplicity and versatility. Uniquely, EAT discards semantic\nmetapredicates, and instead represents semantic roles entirely via positional\nencoding. This is made possible by limiting the number of roles to only three;\na major decrease from the many dozens recognized in e.g. AMR and MRS. EAT's\nsimplicity makes it exceptionally versatile in application. First, we show that\ndrastically reducing semantic roles based on EAT benefits text generation from\nMRS in the test settings of Hajdik et al. (2019). Second, we implement the\nderivation of EAT from a syntactic parse, and apply this for parallel corpus\ngeneration between grammatical classes. Third, we train an encoder-decoder LSTM\nnetwork to map EAT to English. Finally, we use both the encoder-decoder network\nand a rule-based alternative to conduct grammatical transformation from\nEAT-input.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 15:49:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 14:04:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 08:47:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 11:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-15"}

In the power-law phase $T \\sim N^q$ and the\nexponential phase $T \\sim exp(\\alpha N)$. All three phases and the transitions\nbetween them are studied in detail. The breakdown of the continuum\napproximation is identified inside the power-law phase, and the accompanied\nchanges in decline modes are analyzed. The applicability of the emerging\npicture to the analysis of ecological timeseries and to the management of\nconservation efforts is briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 11:34:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 14:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

However, many real life\nchallenges such as time-varying, multilayer, chemical compounds and brain\nnetworks involve analysis of a family of graphs instead of single one opening\nadditional challenges in graph comparison and representation. Traditional\napproaches for learning representations relies on hand-crafting specialized\nheuristics to extract meaningful information about the graphs, e.g statistical\nproperties, structural features, etc. as well as engineered graph distances to\nquantify dissimilarity between networks. In this work we provide an\nunsupervised approach to learn embedding representation for a collection of\ngraphs so that it can be used in numerous graph mining tasks.

Results reveal that our method outperforms\nwell known graph distances and graph-kernels in clustering and classification\ntasks, being highly efficient in runtime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 08:15:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 07:46:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-18"}

Various graphs, for example web or social networks,\nmay contain up to trillions of edges. The sheer size of such datasets, combined\nwith the irregular nature of graph processing, poses unique challenges for the\nruntime and the consumed power. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) can be\nan energy-efficient solution to deliver specialized hardware for graph\nprocessing. This is reflected by the recent interest in developing various\ngraph algorithms and graph processing frameworks on FPGAs. To facilitate\nunderstanding of this emerging domain, we present the first survey and taxonomy\non graph computations on FPGAs. Our survey describes and categorizes existing\nschemes and explains key ideas. Finally, we discuss research and engineering\nchallenges to outline the future of graph computations on FPGAs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 04:46:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Mar 2019 22:29:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2019 16:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}
