This is a well-known trade-off\nbetween communication cost and load balancing in CDNs.\n  In this work, by introducing a new meta-heuristic algorithm, we try to\noptimize this trade-off, that is, to have less-loaded servers at lower\nexperienced communication cost.

This, naively, may look like a miracle, the more that the\nstandard perturbative approach often makes it irresistible to discuss the\nmagnitudes of those corrections as if, individually, they were physically\nrelevant. To shed some more light on this conundrum we advocate a method based\non the symmetry properties of the Coleman-Weinberg effective potential which\nnot only makes it very clear why $m_H\\propto v$ to all orders in the\nperturbative expansion but, at the same time, it does not require any\ninspection of the explicit form of the tadpole equations whatsoever.

Range Value at Risk (RVaR) is a\nnatural interpolation between these two prominent risk measures, which\nconstitutes a tradeoff between the sensitivity of the latter and the robustness\nof the former, turning it into a practically relevant risk measure on its own.\nAs such, there is a need to statistically validate RVaR forecasts and to\ncompare and rank the performance of different RVaR models, tasks subsumed under\nthe term 'backtesting' in finance. The predictive performance is best evaluated\nand compared in terms of strictly consistent loss or scoring functions. That\nis, functions which are minimised in expectation by the correct RVaR forecast.\nMuch like ES, it has been shown recently that RVaR does not admit strictly\nconsistent scoring functions, i.e., it is not elicitable. Mitigating this\nnegative result, this paper shows that a triplet of RVaR with two VaR\ncomponents at different levels is elicitable.

To this end,\nwe find that classical lower bound arguments fail to yield sharp results, and\nnew technical tools are called for.\n  By refining the \"tracing adversary\" technique for lower bounds in the\ntheoretical computer science literature, we formulate a general lower bound\nargument for minimax risks with differential privacy constraints, and apply\nthis argument to high-dimensional mean estimation and linear regression\nproblems.

Thus, the insulating state\nis created by the singlet dimers, the trimer and the two localized $S=1/2$\nstates. Oxygen Frenkel pairs, on the other hand, lead to a metallic state in\nVO$_2$, but are expected to be present in much lower concentrations. In\ncontrast, the Frenkel defects in V$_2$O$_3$ do not directly suppress the\ninsulating character of the material. However, the disorder created by defects\nin V$_2$O$_3$ alters the local magnetic moments and in turn reduces the energy\ncost of a transition between the insulating and conducting phases of the\nmaterial.

In these models, classical\nsingularities are replaced by a \"bounce\" induced by quantum geometry\ncorrections. Undesirable features may arise however depending on the details of\nthe model. In this paper, we focus on Schwarzschild black holes and propose a\nnew effective quantum theory based on polymerisation of new canonical phase\nspace variables inspired by those successful in loop quantum cosmology. The\nquantum corrected spacetime resulting from the solutions of the effective\ndynamics is characterised by infinitely many pairs of trapped and anti-trapped\nregions connected via a space-like transition surface replacing the central\nsingularity.

By applying this argument to the Galactic\nCentre, we show that the S-cluster and the clockwise disc are optimal regions\nfor the generation of such events: one SN out of about 10 000 (100 000)\noccurring in the S-cluster (clockwise disc) is expected to induce an EMRI. If\nwe assume that the natal kicks affecting stellar black holes are significantly\nslower than those experienced by neutron stars, we find that most SN-driven\nEMRIs involve neutron stars. We further estimate the time spanning from the SN\nto the final plunge onto the SMBH to be of the order of few Myr. Finally, we\nextrapolate the rate of SN-driven EMRIs per Milky Way to be up to 10^-8/yr,\nthus we expect that LISA will detect up to a few tens of SN-driven EMRIs every\nyear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 11:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

In this work, we present a novel technique for constraining the\ndynamical history of a star forming environment using PPD properties in a\nstrongly FUV irradiated environment. Applying recent models for FUV induced\nmass loss rates to the PPD population of Cygnus OB2, we constrain how long ago\nprimordial gas was expelled from the region; $ 0.5$ Myr ago if the Shakura &\nSunyaev $\\alpha$-viscosity parameter is $\\alpha = 10^{-2}$ (corresponding to a\nviscous timescale of $\\tau_\\mathrm{visc} \\approx 0.5$ Myr for a disc of scale\nradius $40$ au around a $1\\, M_\\odot$ star).

Barred spiral\ngalaxies often show lower star-formation efficiency (SFE) in their bar region\ncompared to the spiral arms. In this paper, we examine the relation between the\nSFEs and the volume densities of molecular gas $n(\\rm{H}_2)$ in the eight\ndifferent regions within the galactic disk with CO data combined with archival\nfar-ultraviolet and 24 $\\mu$m data.

BCS and BEC limits correspond to $E_F \\gg E_0$ and $E_F \\ll E_0$,\nrespectively. The chemical potential $\\mu = E_F-E_0$ changes the sign between\nthe two regimes.

We\nshow that electrical transport in the quantum critical regime exhibits a rich\nbehavior that depends sensitively on the scattering mechanism and the band\nstructure. In the case of a single large Fermi surface, the resistivity due to\numklapp scattering crosses over from $\\rho\\sim T^2$ at low temperature to\nsublinear at high temperature.

The in situ formation of Jupiter, on the other hand, produces\nsymmetric leading/trailing swarms. The reason for the asymmetry is the relative\ndrift between the migrating planet and the particles in the coorbital\nresonance. The capture happens during the growth of Jupiter's core and Trojan\nasteroids are afterwards carried along during the giant planet's migration to\ntheir final orbits.

In this paper, we relax this\nassumption and propose a general caching framework that captures the\ntransmission cost of the two phases, and hence, results in minimizing the\noverall rate of the caching network. We model the dynamic nature of the network\nthrough a cost structure that allows for varying the network architecture and\ncost per transmission, across the placement and delivery phases.

In many applications, however, we are\ninterested in modeling latent structure and variation that are enriched in a\ntarget dataset compared to some background---e.g. enriched in patients compared\nto the general population. Contrastive learning is a principled framework to\ncapture such enriched variation between the target and background, but\nstate-of-the-art contrastive methods are limited to linear models. In this\npaper, we introduce the contrastive variational autoencoder (cVAE), which\ncombines the benefits of contrastive learning with the power of deep generative\nmodels. The cVAE is designed to identify and enhance salient latent features.\nThe cVAE is trained on two related but unpaired datasets, one of which has\nminimal contribution from the salient latent features. The cVAE explicitly\nmodels latent features that are shared between the datasets, as well as those\nthat are enriched in one dataset relative to the other, which allows the\nalgorithm to isolate and enhance the salient latent features. The algorithm is\nstraightforward to implement, has a similar run-time to the standard VAE, and\nis robust to noise and dataset purity. We conduct experiments across diverse\ntypes of data, including gene expression and facial images, showing that the\ncVAE effectively uncovers latent structure that is salient in a particular\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 19:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-14"}

However, unlike traditional resources such as\nCPU or the network, modern GPUs do not natively support fine-grained sharing\nprimitives. Consequently, implementing common policies such as time sharing and\npreemption are expensive. Worse, when a DL application cannot completely use a\nGPU's resources, the GPU cannot be efficiently shared between multiple\napplications, leading to GPU underutilization.\n  We present Salus to enable two GPU sharing primitives: fast job switching and\nmemory sharing, in order to achieve fine-grained GPU sharing among multiple DL\napplications. Salus implements an efficient, consolidated execution service\nthat exposes the GPU to different DL applications, and enforces fine-grained\nsharing by performing iteration scheduling and addressing associated memory\nmanagement issues.

The mechanisms governing the opening of cavities in transition disks\nare not fully understood. Several processes have been proposed but their\noccurrence rate is still unknown. Aims. We present spatially resolved\nobservations of two transition disks and aim at constraining their vertical and\nradial structure using multiwavelength observations. Methods. We have obtained\nnear-IR scattered light observations with VLT/SPHERE of the transition disks\nJ1608 and J1852. We complement our datasets with ALMA observations and with\nunresolved photometric observations covering a wide range of wavelengths. We\nperformed radiative transfer modeling to analyze the morphology of the disks\nand compare the results with a sample of 20 other transition disks observed\nwith both SPHERE and ALMA. Results. The scattered light image of J1608 reveals\na very inclined disk, with two bright lobes and a large cavity. J1852 shows an\ninner ring extending beyond the coronagraphic radius up to 15au, a gap and a\nsecond ring at 42au. Our radiative transfer model of J1608 indicates that the\nmillimeter-sized grains are less extended vertically and radially than the\nmicron-sized grains, indicating advanced settling and radial drift. We find\ngood agreement with the observations of J1852 with a similar model, but due to\nthe low inclination of the system, the model remains partly degenerate. The\nanalysis of 22 transition disks shows that, in general, the cavities observed\nin scattered light are smaller than the ones detected at millimeter\nwavelengths. Conclusions. The analysis of a sample of transition disks\nindicates that the small grains can flow inward of the region where millimeter\ngrains are trapped. While 15 out of the 22 cavities in our sample could be\nexplained by a planet of less than 13 Jupiter masses, the others either require\nthe presence of a more massive companion or of several low-mass planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 20:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

Although such solutions may indeed maximize\ntask reward, they can be unsuitable for real world systems. Bang-bang control\nmay lead to increased wear and tear or energy consumption, and tends to excite\nundesired second-order dynamics. To counteract this issue, multi-objective\noptimization can be used to simultaneously optimize both the reward and some\nauxiliary cost that discourages undesired (e.g. high-amplitude) control.

TC-Sched uses Constraint Programming to schedule tests to\nrun on multiple machines constrained by the tests' access to shared resources,\nsuch as measurement or networking devices. The CP model is written in SICStus\nProlog and uses the Cumulatives global constraint. Given a set of test cases, a\nset of machines, and a set of shared resources, TC-Sched produces an execution\nschedule where each test is executed once with minimal time between when a\nsource code change is committed and the test results are reported to the\ndeveloper. Experiments reveal that TC-Sched can schedule 500 test cases over\n100 machines in less than 4 minutes for 99.5% of the instances.

The selectivity of KcsA for various ions (K$^+$, Na$^+$, Cl$^-$,\nCa$^{2+}$ and Ba$^{2+}$) is studied analytically, and the profiles of\nconcentrations and electric potential are provided. The selectivity is mainly\ninfluenced by permanent negative charges in filter of channel and the ion\nsizes. K$^+$ is always selected compared with Na$^+$ (or Cl$^-$), as smaller\nion size of Na$^+$ causes larger solvation energy. There is a transition for\nselectivity among K$^+$ and divalent ions (Ca$^{2+}$ and Ba$^{2+}$), when\nnegative charge in filter exceeds a critical value determined by ion size. This\nexplains why divalent ions can block the KcsA channel. The profiles and IV\nrelations are studied by analytical, numerical and hybrid methods, and are\ncross-validated.

The current sky background model for\nCerro Paranal uses an extrapolated aerosol extinction curve. With a set of\nX-Shooter sky observations, we have tested the current model as well as\ndetermined the aerosol extinction from the ultra-violet to near-infrared. To\nour knowledge, this is the first time that a scattered moonlight model has been\nused for this purpose. These observations were taken of blank sky, during three\ndifferent lunar phases, and at six different angular distances from the moon\nfor each night/lunar phase. Overall, the current model does reproduce the\nobservations for average conditions decently well. Using a set of sky\nbackground models with varying aerosol distributions to compare with the\nobservations, we found the most likely aerosol extinction curves, phase\nfunctions, and volume densities for the three nights of observations and\ncompare them with the current model. While there were some degeneracies in the\naerosol scattering properties, the extinction curves tend to flatten towards\nredder wavelengths and are overall less steep compared to the extrapolated\ncurve used in the current model. Also, the current model had significantly less\ncoarse particles compared to the favored volume densities from the X-Shooter\ndata. For the three nights of sky observations, the aerosol size distributions\ndiffered, most likely reflecting the changes in atmospheric conditions and\naerosol content.

To describe these phenomena, the two-layer\nshallow-water equations is commonly employed. When one layer is significantly\ndeeper than the other, it is common to approximate the system with the much\nsimpler one-layer shallow water equations. So far, it has been assumed that\nthis approximation is invalid near shocks, and one has applied additional front\nconditions for the shock speed. In this paper, we prove mathematically that an\neffective one-layer model can be derived from the two-layer equations that\ncorrectly captures the behaviour of shocks and contact discontinuities without\nany additional closure relations. The proof yields a novel formulation of an\neffective one-layer shallow water model. The result shows that simplification\nto an effective one-layer model is well justified mathematically and can be\nmade without additional knowledge of the shock behaviour. The shock speed in\nthe proposed model is consistent with empirical models and identical to the\nfront conditions that have been found theoretically by e.g. von K\\'arm\\'an and\nby Benjamin. This suggests that the breakdown of the shallow-water equations in\nthe vicinity of shocks is less severe than previously thought. We further\ninvestigate the applicability of the shallow water framework to shocks by\nstudying shocks in one-dimensional lock-exchange/lock-release. We derive\nexpressions for the Froude number that are in good agreement with the widely\nemployed expression by Benjamin. We then solve the equations numerically to\nillustrate how quickly the proposed model converges to solutions of the full\ntwo-layer shallow-water equations.

Therefore, to achieve spectral efficient communication, using\nrate adaptation methods are essential. In this study, we propose a rateless\ncodes based rate adaptation method which adjusts transmission rate at receiver\nside and does not require channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter\nside. Spectral efficiency of proposed method is analyzed and compared with\nadaptive modulation and coding (AMC) rate adaptation method widely used in\nliterature.

To overcome multi-path effects, optical orthogonal\nfrequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is used.

While the optimal order of these\nparameters in terms of the simulation budget can be readily established, the\nprecise best values depend on model characteristics that are typically unknown\nin advance. We introduce a framework to construct new classes of estimators,\nbased on judicious combinations of simulation runs on sequences of tuning\nparameter values, such that the estimators consistently outperform a given\ntuning parameter choice in the conventional approach, regardless of the unknown\nmodel characteristics.

One way to achieve this sensitivity is by engineering a\nstrong but nonresonant interaction between the oscillator and an atom. In a\nsystem with sufficient quantum coherence, this interaction allows one to\ndistinguish different phonon number states by resolvable differences in the\natom's transition frequency. Such dispersive measurements have been studied in\ncavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics where experiments using real and\nartificial atoms have resolved the photon number states of cavities. Here, we\nreport an experiment where an artificial atom senses the motional energy of a\ndriven nanomechanical oscillator with sufficient sensitivity to resolve the\nquantization of its energy. To realize this, we build a hybrid platform that\nintegrates nanomechanical piezoelectric resonators with a microwave\nsuperconducting qubit on the same chip. We excite phonons with resonant pulses\nof varying amplitude and probe the resulting excitation spectrum of the qubit\nto observe phonon-number-dependent frequency shifts $\\approx 5$ times larger\nthan the qubit linewidth. Our result demonstrates a fully integrated platform\nfor quantum acoustics that combines large couplings, considerable coherence\ntimes, and excellent control over the mechanical mode structure. With modest\nexperimental improvements, we expect our approach will make quantum\nnondemolition measurements of phonons an experimental reality, leading the way\nto new quantum sensors and information processing approaches that use\nchip-scale nanomechanical devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 00:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

Prior works have demonstrated the use of cache miss\npatterns to detect these attacks. We find that cache miss traces can be easily\nspoofed and thus they may not be able to identify smarter adversaries.

Traditional\nsegmentation approaches depend heavily upon hand-crafted features and a priori\nknowledge of the user. As such, these methods are difficult to be adapt to the\nclinical environment. Recently, deep learning methods based on fully\nconvolutional networks (FCNs) have been successful in resolving segmentation\nproblems. However, the reliance on large annotated training data is problematic\nwhen dealing with medical images. If a sufficient amount of annotated training\ndata to cover all possible variations is not available, FCNs do not provide\naccurate segmentation. In addition, FCNs have a large receptive field in the\nconvolutional layers, and hence produce coarse outputs of boundaries. Hence, we\npropose a new fully automated method that we refer to as a dual-stage fully\nconvolutional networks (DSFCN). Our approach leverages deep residual\narchitectures and FCNs and learns and infers the location of the optic cup and\ndisk in a step-wise manner with fine-grained details.

However, the details of the cosmic-ray acceleration are still not\nwell understood. Gamma ray observation is a promising method to study\ncosmic-ray acceleration in the SNRs, because a hadronic gamma ray can trace\nhigh energy cosmic-rays above ~GeV energy. Conventional theory predicts that\nthe hadronic gamma ray shows a flat vFv spectrum from the pion-creation\nthreshold energy to the maximum energy of diffusive shock acceleration. In this\npaper, by employing numerical simulations that solve a hybrid system of the\nmagnetohydrodynamics of a molecular cloud and diffusive propagation of\ncosmic-rays, we demonstrate that the hadronic gamma ray spectrum can be harder\nthan the conventional one and that the modulated spectrum becomes consistent\nwith observations. The modification mechanism is explained as follows: The\ncosmic-rays accelerated at the supernova blast wave shock propagate into a\nclump of a molecular cloud. The cosmic-ray streaming in the cloud induces the\nso-called Bell instability that induces Alfven waves in the cloud. The induced\nmagnetic field fluctuations prevent further cosmic-ray incursion by diminishing\nthe diffusion coefficient for the cosmic-rays below ~1 TeV energy.

In order to understand the role of\nvan der Waals (vdW) interactions on structural parameters, we have considered\n12 different vdW corrected functionals and found that the optPBE-vdW functional\npredicts the equilibrium structural parameters reliably with less than 0.009 %\naccuracy. So, the optPBE-vdW functional is used to calculate charge density,\nelectron localization function, total as well as the partial density of state,\nBader and Born effective charge etc. We have observed that hydrogen is\nexhibiting amphoteric behavior with H closer to B in the negatively charged\nstate and that neighboring to N is in a positively charged state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 05:41:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-14"}

Rather than requiring all notions of\nfairness to (partially) hold at the same time, we ask which one of them is the\nmost appropriate given the societal domain in which the decision-making model\nis to be deployed. We take a descriptive approach and set out to identify the\nnotion of fairness that best captures \\emph{lay people's perception of\nfairness}. We run adaptive experiments designed to pinpoint the most compatible\nnotion of fairness with each participant's choices through a small number of\ntests.

Inferring the location of the current sources that\ngenerated these magnetic fields is an ill-posed inverse problem known as source\nimaging. When considering a group study, a baseline approach consists in\ncarrying out the estimation of these sources independently for each subject.\nThe ill-posedness of each problem is typically addressed using sparsity\npromoting regularizations. A straightforward way to define a common pattern for\nthese sources is then to average them. A more advanced alternative relies on a\njoint localization of sources for all subjects taken together, by enforcing\nsome similarity across all estimated sources. An important advantage of this\napproach is that it consists in a single estimation in which all measurements\nare pooled together, making the inverse problem better posed. Such a joint\nestimation poses however a few challenges, notably the selection of a valid\nregularizer that can quantify such spatial similarities. We propose in this\nwork a new procedure that can do so while taking into account the geometrical\nstructure of the cortex. We call this procedure Minimum Wasserstein Estimates\n(MWE). The benefits of this model are twofold. First, joint inference allows to\npool together the data of different brain geometries, accumulating more spatial\ninformation. Second, MWE are defined through Optimal Transport (OT) metrics\nwhich provide a tool to model spatial proximity between cortical sources of\ndifferent subjects, hence not enforcing identical source location in the group.\nThese benefits allow MWE to be more accurate than standard MEG source\nlocalization techniques. To support these claims, we perform source\nlocalization on realistic MEG simulations based on forward operators derived\nfrom MRI scans.

Cells dividing at a fixed size regardless of birth size (sizer) are\nexpected to show a division-birth slope of 0, whereas cells dividing after\ngrowing for a fixed size increment (adder) have an expected slope of +1 [4].\nThese two theoretical values are, however, rarely experimentally observed.

Synthetic likelihood is one approach for carrying out\ninference when the likelihood is intractable, but it is straightforward to\nsimulate from the model. The method constructs an approximate likelihood by\ntaking a vector summary statistic as being multivariate normal, with the\nunknown mean and covariance matrix estimated by simulation for any given\nparameter value. Our article makes three contributions. The first shows that if\nthe summary statistic satisfies a central limit theorem, then the synthetic\nlikelihood posterior is asymptotically normal and yields credible sets with the\ncorrect level of frequentist coverage. This result is similar to that obtained\nby approximate Bayesian computation. The second contribution compares the\ncomputational efficiency of Bayesian synthetic likelihood and approximate\nBayesian computation using the acceptance probability for rejection and\nimportance sampling algorithms with a \"good\" proposal distribution. We show\nthat Bayesian synthetic likelihood is computationally more efficient than\napproximate Bayesian computation, and behaves similarly to regression-adjusted\napproximate Bayesian computation. Based on the asymptotic results, the third\ncontribution proposes using adjusted inference methods when a possibly\nmisspecified form is assumed for the covariance matrix of the synthetic\nlikelihood, such as diagonal or a factor model, to speed up the computation.\nThe methodology is illustrated with some simulated and real examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 10:02:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 10:10:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 08:07:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 06:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-15"}

The striking feature is that the total energy released is extremely\nhigh as compared to that in tens of outbursts which followed. In this paper, we\nlook at this event and study both the spectral and temporal properties of the\nsource using two component advective flow (TCAF) paradigm. We extract accretion\nflow parameters for each observation from spectral properties of the decay\nphase and determine the mass of the black hole.

In giant planet\ninteriors, it could take the form of density staircases, which are convective\nlayers separated by thin stably stratified interfaces. In addition, the\nefficiency of tidal dissipation is known to depend strongly on the planetary\ninternal structure. We aim to study the resulting tidal dissipation when\ninternal waves are excited in a region of layered semi-convection by tidal\ngravitational forcing due to other bodies (such as moons in giant planet\nsystems, or stars in hot Jupiter systems). We adopt a local Cartesian model\nwith a background layered density profile subjected to an imposed tidal\nforcing, and we compute the viscous and thermal dissipation rates numerically.\nWe find that the rates of tidal dissipation can be enhanced in a region of\nlayered semi-convection compared to a uniformly convective medium, where the\nlatter corresponds with the usual assumption adopted in giant planet interior\nmodels. In particular, a region of layered semi-convection possesses a richer\nset of resonances, allowing enhanced dissipation for a wider range of tidal\nfrequencies. The details of these results significantly depend on the\nstructural properties of the layered semi-convective regions. Layered\nsemi-convection could contribute towards explaining the high tidal dissipation\nrates observed in Jupiter and Saturn, which have not yet been fully explained\nby theory.

With higher\nyields of $b$-baryons, achievable in subsequent runs of the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC), we find that the photon polarization measurement can play a\npivotal role in constraining different new physics scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 11:55:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 17:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

The magnetic field structure in the AR was complicated: there were\nseveral filaments including the one that erupted and caused the CME. We hence\ncarefully investigated the photospheric magnetic field, brightenings observed\nin the solar atmosphere, and the three-dimensional coronal magnetic field\nextrapolated from nonlinear force-free field modeling, using data from Hinode\nand Solar Dynamics Observatory. We found three intriguing points : (1) There\nwas a compact but noticeably highly twisted magnetic field structure that is\nrepresented by a small filament in the C2.4 flaring region, where a tiny\nprecursor brightening was observed before the C2.4 flare. (2) The C2.4 flaring\nregion is located in the vicinity of a foot point of the closed field that\nprohibits the filament from erupting. (3) The filament shows a sudden eruption\nafter the C2.4 flare and accompanying small filament eruption.

In this study, this technique has been\nused for the production of large-scale tungsten linear structures. The\norientation of the wire feeding has been studied and optimised to obtain\ndefect-free tungsten deposits. In particular, front wire feeding eliminated the\noccurrence of pores and micro-cracks, when compared to side wire feeding. The\nmicrostructure, the occurrence of defects and their relationship with the\ndeposition process have also been discussed.

Precise abundance\ndeterminations of the various s-process elements, especially, of the lightest,\nshort-lived radionuclide technetium will establish constraints for the\nformation of s-process elements in asymptotic giant branch stars as well as\nmass transfer through, for example, stellar wind, Roche-lobe overflow, and\ncommon-envelope evolution. We performed a detailed spectral analysis of the\nK-type subgiant central star of the planetary nebula Hen 2-39 based on\nhigh-resolution optical spectra obtained with the Ultraviolet and Visual\nEchelle Spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope using LTE model atmospheres.\nWe confirm the effective temperature of $T_\\mathrm{eff} = 4350 \\pm 150$ K for\nthe central star of the planetary nebula Hen 2-39.

Super-resolution techniques can\nobtain high-resolution MRI images. The traditional methods obtained the\nresolution enhancement of brain MRI by interpolations, affecting the accuracy\nof the following diagnose process. The requirement for brain image quality is\nfast increasing. In this paper, we propose an image super-resolution (SR)\nmethod based on overcomplete dictionaries and inherent similarity of an image\nto recover the high-resolution (HR) image from a single low-resolution (LR)\nimage. We explore the nonlocal similarity of the image to tentatively search\nfor similar blocks in the whole image and present a joint reconstruction method\nbased on compressive sensing (CS) and similarity constraints. The sparsity and\nself-similarity of the image blocks are taken as the constraints. The proposed\nmethod is summarized in the following steps. First, a dictionary classification\nmethod based on the measurement domain is presented. The image blocks are\nclassified into smooth, texture and edge parts by analyzing their features in\nthe measurement domain. Then, the corresponding dictionaries are trained using\nthe classified image blocks. Equally important, in the reconstruction part, we\nuse the CS reconstruction method to recover the HR brain MRI image, considering\nboth nonlocal similarity and the sparsity of an image as the constraints. This\nmethod performs better both visually and quantitatively than some existing\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 13:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-14"}

It is found that elastic strains dominate\nplastic strains near the crack tip, and thus the Cauchy stress and the strain\nstate are given asymptotically by the elastic K-field. This crack tip elastic\nzone is embedded within an annular elasto-plastic zone. This feature is\npredicted by both a crack tip asymptotic analysis and a finite element\ncomputation. When small scale yielding applies, three distinct regimes exist:\nan outer elastic K field, an intermediate elasto-plastic field, and an inner\nelastic K field. The inner elastic core significantly influences the crack\nopening profile. Crack tip plasticity is suppressed when the material length\nscale $\\ell$ of the gradient theory is on the order of the plastic zone size\nestimation, as dictated by the remote stress intensity factor. A generalized\nJ-integral for strain gradient plasticity is stated and used to characterise\nthe asymptotic response ahead of a short crack.

In this analysis, we propose a dark matter explanation\nto both exotic features seen by DAMPE. In our model, dark matter annihilates in\nthe galaxy via two different channels that lead to both a narrow resonance\nspectrum near 1.4 TeV and electron excess events over an extended energy range\nthus generating the break structure around TeV. The two annihilation channels\nare mediated by two gauge bosons that interact both with dark matter and with\nthe standard model fermions. Dark matter annihilations through the s-channel\nprocess mediated by the heavier boson produce monoenergetic electron-positron\npairs leading to the resonance excess. The lighter boson has a mass smaller\nthan the dark matter such that they can be on-shell produced in dark matter\nannihilations in the galaxy; the lighter bosons in the final state subsequently\ndecay to generate the extended excess events due to the smeared electron energy\nspectrum in this process. We further analyze constraints from various\nexperiments, including HESS, Fermi, AMS, and LHC, to the parameter space of the\nmodel where both excess events can be accounted for. In order to interpret the\ntwo new features in the DAMPE data, dark matter annihilation cross sections in\nthe current galaxy are typically much larger than the canonical thermal cross\nsection needed for the correct dark matter relic abundance. This discrepancy,\nhowever, is remedied by the nonperturbative Sommerfeld enhancement because of\nthe existence of a lighter mediator in the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 14:28:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

A linear quadratic gaussian\nregulator is considered along with a system identification technique to build\nreduced-order models for control. Three actuators are developed with different\nspatial supports, corresponding to a baseline shape with only vertical forcing,\nand to two other shapes obtained by different optimization procedures. A\ncomputationally efficient method is derived to obtain an actuator which aims to\ninduce the exact structures which are inside the boundary layer, given in terms\nof their first spectral proper orthogonal decomposition mode, and an actuator\nthat maximizes the energy of induced downstream structures. Two free-stream\nturbulence levels were evaluated, corresponding to 3.0% and 3.5%, and\nclosed-loop control is applied in large-eddy simulations of transitional\nboundary layers. All three actuators lead to significant delays in the\ntransition to turbulence and were shown to be robust to mild variations in the\nfree-stream turbulence levels. Differences are understood in terms of the SPOD\nof actuation and FST-induced fields along with the causality of the control\nscheme. The actuator optimized to generate the leading downstream SPOD mode,\nrepresenting the streaks in the open-loop flow, leads to the highest transition\ndelay, which can be understood due to its capability of closely cancelling\nstructures in the boundary layer. However, it is shown that even with the\nactuator located downstream of the input measurement it may become impossible\nto cancel incoming disturbances in a causal way, depending on the wall-normal\nposition of the output and on the actuator considered, which limits sensor and\nactuator placement capable of good closed-loop performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 14:33:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

This paper aims at\naddressing the question of the feasibility of a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua in 2024\nand beyond. Using the OITS trajectory simulation tool, various scenarios are\nanalyzed, including a powered Jupiter flyby and Solar Oberth maneuver, a\nJupiter powered flyby, and more complex flyby schemes including a Mars and\nVenus flyby. With a powered Jupiter flyby and Solar Oberth maneuver, we\nidentify a trajectory to 1I/'Oumuamua with a launch date in 2033, a total\nvelocity increment of 18.2 km/s, and arrival at 1I/'Oumuamua in 2048.

Both launch dates would\nprovide over a decade for spacecraft development, in contrast to the previously\nidentified 2020-2021 launch dates. Furthermore, the distance from the Sun at\nthe Oberth burn is at 5 Solar radii. This results in heat flux values, which\nare of the same order of magnitude as for the Parker Solar Probe.

Alternatively, one can interpret\nthe rule of thumb as preservation of the variance over samples for a fixed\nnetwork. The two interpretations differ little for a shallow net, but the\ndifference is shown to grow with depth for a deep ReLU net by decomposing the\ntotal variance into the network-averaged sum of the sample variance and square\nof the sample mean. We demonstrate that even when the total variance is\npreserved, the sample variance decays in the later layers through an analytical\ncalculation in the limit of infinite network width, and numerical simulations\nfor finite width.

To address these problems, this paper\nproposes an innovative framework to jointly learn a nonlinear face model from a\ndiverse set of raw 3D scan databases and establish dense point-to-point\ncorrespondence among their scans. Specifically, by treating input scans as\nunorganized point clouds, we explore the use of PointNet architectures for\nconverting point clouds to identity and expression feature representations,\nfrom which the decoder networks recover their 3D face shapes.

Methods:\nThirty subjects, from a retrospective study, of which 11 were classified as dry\neye and 19 as normal, were included. High speed videokeratoscopy measurements\nwere performed using E300 videokeratoscope (Medmont Pty., Ltd, Melbourne,\nAustralia). Raw data was analyzed using a recently proposed method to estimate\nthe dynamics of the tear film, based on a fractal dimension approach. This\nmethod provides three time-varying indicators related to the regularity of the\nreflected rings: Tear Film Surface Quality (TFSQ) indicator, Breaks Feature\nIndicator (BFI) and Distortions Feature Indicator (DFI). From each indicator\nfive parameters were extracted and analyzed, including non-invasive break up\ntime, mean value of the indicator in the stability phase, mean value of the\nindicator in the whole inter blink interval, mean value of the indicator in the\nlevelling phase and the general trend of the time series.

Results: The best discrimination performance\nbetween dry eye and normal subjects was achieved with the BFI non-invasive\nbreak up time parameter, with an area under the curve of 0.85.

All such\nhierarchies are built through the same construction process: start from an\ninitial class of languages and build new levels using two generic operations.\nConcatenation hierarchies have gathered a lot of interest since the 70s, thanks\nto an alternate logical definition: each concatenation hierarchy is the\nquantification alternation hierarchy within a variant of first-order logic over\nwords.\n  Our goal is to understand such hierarchies. We look at two decision problems:\nmembership and separation. For a class of languages C, C-separation takes two\nregular languages as input and asks whether there exists a third one in C\nincluding the first one and disjoint from the second one. Settling whether\nseparation is decidable for the levels within a given concatenation hierarchy\nis among the most fundamental and challenging questions in formal language\ntheory. In all prominent cases, it is open, or answered positively for low\nlevels only. Recently, a breakthrough was made using a generic approach for a\nspecific kind of hierarchy: those with a finite basis. In this case, separation\nis always decidable for levels 1/2, 1 and 3/2.\n  Our main theorem is similar but independent: we consider hierarchies with\npossibly infinite bases, but that may only contain group languages. An example\nis the quantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic with modular\npredicates: its basis consists of languages counting the length of words modulo\nsome number. Using a generic approach, we show that for any such hierarchy, if\nseparation is decidable for the basis, then it is decidable for levels up to\n3/2. This complements the aforementioned result nicely: all bases considered in\nthe literature are either finite or made of group languages. Thus, one may\nhandle the lower levels of any prominent hierarchy in a generic way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 15:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-14"}

This dynamics is\noften attributed as the predator--prey oscillations induced by ZF collisional\ndamping; however, similar dynamics is also observed in collisionless ZFs, in\nwhich case a different mechanism must be involved. Here, we propose a\nsemi-analytic theory that explains the transition between the oscillations and\nsaturation of collisionless ZFs within the quasilinear Hasegawa--Mima model. By\nanalyzing phase-space trajectories of DW quanta (driftons) within the\ngeometrical-optics (GO) approximation, we argue that the parameter that\ncontrols this transition is $N\\sim\\gamma_{{\\rm MI}}/\\omega_{{\\rm DW}}$, where\n$\\gamma_{{\\rm MI}}$ is the MI growth rate and $\\omega_{{\\rm DW}}$ is the linear\nDW frequency. We argue that at $N\\ll1$, ZFs oscillate due to the presence of\nso-called passing drifton trajectories, and we derive an approximate formula\nfor the ZF amplitude as a function of time in this regime. We also show that at\n$N\\gtrsim1$, the passing trajectories vanish and ZFs saturate monotonically,\nwhich can be attributed to phase mixing of higher-order sidebands. A\nmodification of $N$ that accounts for effects beyond the GO limit is also\nproposed. These analytic results are tested against both quasilinear and\nfully-nonlinear simulations.

To be precise, we need to recover $X^*$ from $y_k := |A_k{}'\nx^*_k|, k=1,2,\\dots, q$ when the measurement matrices $A_k$ are mutually\nindependent.

A strong\nrisk factor for CVD events is the amount of coronary artery calcium (CAC). To\nmeet demands of the increasing interest in quantification of CAC, i.e. coronary\ncalcium scoring, especially as an unrequested finding for screening and\nresearch, automatic methods have been proposed. Current automatic calcium\nscoring methods are relatively computationally expensive and only provide\nscores for one type of CT. To address this, we propose a computationally\nefficient method that employs two ConvNets: the first performs registration to\nalign the fields of view of input CTs and the second performs direct regression\nof the calcium score, thereby circumventing time-consuming intermediate CAC\nsegmentation. Optional decision feedback provides insight in the regions that\ncontributed to the calcium score. Experiments were performed using 903 cardiac\nCT and 1,687 chest CT scans. The method predicted calcium scores in less than\n0.3 s. Intra-class correlation coefficient between predicted and manual calcium\nscores was 0.98 for both cardiac and chest CT. The method showed almost perfect\nagreement between automatic and manual CVD risk categorization in both\ndatasets, with a linearly weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.95 in cardiac CT and 0.93\nin chest CT. Performance is similar to that of state-of-the-art methods, but\nthe proposed method is hundreds of times faster.

In\norder to prove this theory, Mikhailov published two type of experimental\nsetups: One using vacuum cathode tube and another using glow-discharge-lamps to\ngenerate oscillating and accelerating electrons. Whereas the glow-discharge\nexperiment was already evaluated by several groups, here we are focusing on\nreplicating the vacuum tube configuration. Under right circumstances, electrons\ninside a vacuum tube start to oscillate around a grid electrode, which is\ncalled Barkhausen-Kurz oscillations.

We succeeded\nin generating Barkhausen-Kurz oscillations with a different vacuum tube and\nfound no frequency shifts below an order of magnitude of Assis's prediction by\noperating the tube inside a charged spherical shell that would indicate a\nchange in the electron's mass.

In this paper we propose the general concept of\n*conditional quantiles* that can extend incremental estimators to jointly track\nmultiple quantiles. We apply the concept to propose two new estimators.\nExtensive experimental results, on both synthetic and real-life data, show that\nthe new estimators clearly outperform legacy state-of-the-art joint quantile\ntracking algorithm and achieve faster adaptivity in dynamically varying data\nstreams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 07:47:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-15"}

Directly optimizing the long-term user engagement is a non-trivial\nproblem, as the learning target is usually not available for conventional\nsupervised learning methods. Though reinforcement learning~(RL) naturally fits\nthe problem of maximizing the long term rewards, applying RL to optimize\nlong-term user engagement is still facing challenges: user behaviors are\nversatile and difficult to model, which typically consists of both instant\nfeedback~(e.g. clicks, ordering) and delayed feedback~(e.g. dwell time,\nrevisit); in addition, performing effective off-policy learning is still\nimmature, especially when combining bootstrapping and function approximation.\n  To address these issues, in this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning\nframework --- FeedRec to optimize the long-term user engagement.

The compression wave is generally measured by Doppler velocimetry\nfrom a surface that can be observed with optical or near-optical photons. For\nhigh-pressure ramp loading, the reflectivity of a free surface often decreases\nas it is accelerated by the ramp wave, and window materials transparent to the\nprobing photons are used to keep the surface flatter and preserve its\nreflectivity. We previously described a method of analyzing ramp-wave data\nmeasured at the free surface which did not require numerical iteration.\nHowever, this method breaks down when the pressure at the surface changes and\nhence cannot be used for data taken with a finite-impedance window. We have now\ngeneralized this non-iterative analysis method to apply to measurements taken\nthrough a window. Free surfaces can be treated seamlessly, and the need for\nsampling at uniform intervals of velocity has been removed.

Images of damaged buildings and components provide valuable evidence to\nunderstand the consequences on our structures. However, in many cases, images\nof damaged buildings are often captured without sufficient spatial context.\nAlso, they may be hard to recognize in cases with severe damage. Incorporating\npast images showing a pre-disaster condition of such buildings is helpful to\naccurately evaluate possible circumstances related to a building's failure. One\nof the best resources to observe the pre-disaster condition of the buildings is\nGoogle Street View. A sequence of 360 panorama images which are captured along\nstreets enables all-around views at each location on the street. Once a user\nknows the GPS information near the building, all external views of the building\ncan be made available. In this study, we develop an automated technique to\nextract past building images from 360 panorama images serviced by Google Street\nView. Users only need to provide a geo-tagged image, collected near the target\nbuilding, and the rest of the process is fully automated. High-quality and\nundistorted building images are extracted from past panoramas. Since the\npanoramas are collected from various locations near the building along the\nstreet, the user can identify its pre-disaster conditions from the full set of\nexternal views.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 01:14:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-01"}
