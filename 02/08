However, discovering the right sticker from a large and ever\nexpanding pool of stickers while chatting can be cumbersome. In this paper, we\ndescribe a system for recommending stickers in real time as the user is typing\nbased on the context of the conversation. We decompose the sticker\nrecommendation (SR) problem into two steps. First, we predict the message that\nthe user is likely to send in the chat. Second, we substitute the predicted\nmessage with an appropriate sticker. Majority of Hike's messages are in the\nform of text which is transliterated from users' native language to the Roman\nscript. This leads to numerous orthographic variations of the same message and\nmakes accurate message prediction challenging. To address this issue, we learn\ndense representations of chat messages employing character level convolution\nnetwork in an unsupervised manner. We use them to cluster the messages that\nhave the same meaning. In the subsequent steps, we predict the message cluster\ninstead of the message. Our approach does not depend on human labelled data\n(except for validation), leading to fully automatic updation and tuning\npipeline for the underlying models. We also propose a novel hybrid message\nprediction model, which can run with low latency on low-end phones that have\nsevere computational limitations. Our described system has been deployed for\nmore than $6$ months and is being used by millions of users along with hundreds\nof thousands of expressive stickers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 16:01:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 15:51:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 02:53:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2019 12:30:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

We find that the mid-IR water emission lines are similar to the\n\"narrow component\" in CO rovibrational emission (Banzatti & Pontoppidan 2015),\nconsistent with disk radii of a few AU. The emission lines are either single\npeaked, or consistent with a double peak. Single-peaked emission lines cannot\nbe produced with a Keplerian disk model, and may suggest that water\nparticipates in the disk winds proposed to explain single-peaked CO emission\nlines (Bast et al. 2011, Pontoppidan et al. 2011). Double-peaked emission lines\ncan be used to determine the radius at which the line emission luminosity drops\noff. For HL Tau, the lower limit on this measured dropoff radius is consistent\nwith the 13 AU dark ring (ALMA partnership et al. 2015). We also report\nvariable line/continuum ratios from the disks around DR Tau and RW Aur, which\nwe attribute to continuum changes and line flux changes, respectively. The\nreduction in RW Aur line flux corresponds with an observed dimming at visible\nwavelengths (Rodriguez et al. 2013).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 16:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

A spin network\nedge carries a half-integer spin, representing basic quanta of area, and the\nstandard framework imposes an area matching constraint along the edge: it\ncarries the same spin at its source and target vertices. In the context of\ncoarse-graining, or equivalently of the definition of spin networks as\nprojective limits of graphs, it appears natural to introduce excitations of\ncurvature along the edges. An edge is then treated similarly to a propagator\nliving on the links of Feynman diagrams in quantum field theory: curvature\nexcitations create little loops -- tadpoles -- which renormalize it. This\nrelaxes the area matching condition, with different spins at both ends of the\nedge. We show that this is equivalent to combining the usual SU(2) holonomy\nalong the edge with a Lorentz boost into SL(2,C) group elements living on the\nspin network edges, underlining the fact that the Ashtekar-Barbero connection\ncarries extrinsic curvature degrees of freedom.

Optical atomic\nclocks require local oscillators with exceptional optical coherence due to the\nchallenge of performing spectroscopy on their ultra-narrow linewidth clock\ntransitions. Advances in laser stabilization have thus enabled rapid progress\nin clock precision. A new class of ultrastable lasers based on cryogenic\nsilicon reference cavities has recently demonstrated the longest optical\ncoherence times to date. In this work we utilize such a local oscillator, along\nwith a state-of-the-art frequency comb for coherence transfer, with two Sr\noptical lattice clocks to achieve an unprecedented level of clock stability.\nThrough an anti-synchronous comparison, the fractional instability of both\nclocks is assessed to be $4.8\\times 10^{-17}/\\sqrt{\\tau}$ for an averaging time\n$\\tau$ in seconds. Synchronous interrogation reveals a quantum projection noise\ndominated instability of $3.5(2)\\times10^{-17}/\\sqrt{\\tau}$, resulting in a\nprecision of $5.8(3)\\times 10^{-19}$ after a single hour of averaging. The\nability to measure sub-$10^{-18}$ level frequency shifts in such short\ntimescales will impact a wide range of applications for clocks in quantum\nsensing and fundamental physics. For example, this precision allows one to\nresolve the gravitational red shift from a 1 cm elevation change in only 20\nminutes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 17:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

However, this\nhigh resolution makes FWI prone to cycle skipping, which drives the inversion\nto a local minimum when the initial model is not accurate enough. Other sources\nof nonlinearities and ill-posedness are noise, uneven illumination, approximate\nwave physics and parameter cross-talks. All these sources of error require\nrobust and versatile regularized optimization approaches to mitigate their\nimprint on FWI while preserving its intrinsic resolution power. To achieve this\ngoal, we implement bound constraints and total variation (TV) regularization in\nthe so-called frequency-domain wavefield-reconstruction inversion (WRI) with\nthe alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). In the ADMM framework,\nWRI relies on an augmented Lagrangian function, a combination of penalty and\nLagrangian functions, to extend the FWI search space by relaxing the\nwave-equation constraint during early iterations. Moreover, ADMM breaks down\nthe joint wavefield reconstruction plus parameter estimation problem into a\nsequence of two linear subproblems, whose solutions are coordinated to provide\nthe solution of the global problem. The decomposability of ADMM is further\nexploited to interface in a straightforward way bound constraints and TV\nregularization with WRI via variable splitting and proximal operators. The\nresilience of our regularized WRI formulation to cycle skipping and noise as\nwell as its resolution power are illustrated with two targets of the\nlarge-contrast BP salt model. Starting from a 3Hz frequency and a crude initial\nmodel, the extended search space allows for the reconstruction of the salt and\nsubsalt structures with a high fidelity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 17:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

In the context of\nmicrobiome studies, this problem arises when researchers wish to use a sample\nfrom a population of microbes to estimate the population proportion of a\nparticular taxon, known as the taxon's relative abundance. In this paper, we\npropose a beta-binomial model for this task. Like existing models, our model\nallows for a taxon's relative abundance to be associated with covariates of\ninterest. However, unlike existing models, our proposal also allows for the\noverdispersion in the taxon's counts to be associated with covariates of\ninterest.

Modern\ncompilers are unable to analyze and retarget the code to newer vector\ninstruction sets.

The United States Department of State's\nBureau of Counter-Terrorism, maintains a list of 66 terrorist organizations\nspanning the entire world. Actively monitoring a large number of organizations\nand their members, require considerable amounts of resources on the part of law\nenforcement agencies. Oftentimes, the law enforcement agencies do not have\nadequate resources to monitor these organizations and their members\neffectively. On multiple incidences of terrorist attacks in recent times across\nEurope, it has been observed that the perpetrators of the attack were in the\nsuspect databases of the law enforcement authorities, but weren't under active\nsurveillance at the time of the attack, due to resource limitations on the part\nof the authorities. As the suspect databases in various countries are very\nlarge, and it takes significant amount of technical and human resources to\nmonitor a suspect in the database, monitoring all the suspects in the database\nmay be an impossible task. In this paper, we propose a novel terror network\nmonitoring approach that will significantly reduce the resource requirement of\nlaw enforcement authorities, but still provide the capability of uniquely\nidentifying a suspect in case the suspect becomes active in planning a\nterrorist attack. The approach relies on the assumption that, when an\nindividual becomes active in planning a terrorist attack, his/her\nfriends/associates will have some inkling of the individuals plan. Accordingly,\neven if the individual is not under active surveillance by the authorities, but\nthe individual's friends/associates are, then the individual planning the\nattack can be uniquely identified.

This question can be answered by\nappealing to the quantum error correcting properties of holography, and it was\nrecently shown that robust bulk (entanglement wedge) reconstruction can be\nachieved using a universal recovery channel known as the twirled Petz map. In\nshort, one can use the twirled Petz map to recover bulk data from a subset of\nthe boundary. However, this map involves an averaging procedure over bulk and\nboundary modular time, and hence it can be somewhat intractable to evaluate in\npractice.

While the presence of salt provides\nan easy method to control the net interparticle interaction, the nonlinearities\narising from electrostatic screening make it difficult to quantify the strength\nof the interaction. In particular, when charged particles assemble into\nclusters or aggregates, nonlinear effects render the interactions strongly\nnon-pairwise. Here we report Brownian dynamics simulations to investigate the\neffect that the non-pairwise nature of electrostatic interactions has on\nnanoparticle assembly. We compare these simulations to a system in which the\nelectrostatics are modeled by a strictly pairwise Yukawa potential. We find\nthat both systems show a narrow range in parameter space where the particles\nform well-ordered crystals. Bordering this range are regions where the net\ninteractions are too weak to stabilize aggregated structures, or strong enough\nthat the system becomes kinetically trapped in a gel. The non-pairwise\npotential differs from the pairwise system in the appearance of an amorphous\nphase for strongly charged particles.

Unfortunately, due to the possible presence of malicious\ndynamic actors, it is infeasible to develop an algorithm that can guarantee\ncollision-free operation. Instead, one can attempt to design a control\ntechnique that guarantees the robot is not-at-fault in any collision. In the\nliterature, making such guarantees in real time has been restricted to static\nenvironments or specific dynamic models. To ensure not-at-fault behavior, a\nrobot must first correctly sense and predict the world around it within some\nsufficiently large sensor horizon (the prediction problem), then correctly\ncontrol relative to the predictions (the control problem). This paper addresses\nthe control problem by proposing Reachability-based Trajectory Design for\nDynamic environments (RTD-D), which guarantees that a robot with an arbitrary\nnonlinear dynamic model correctly responds to predictions in arbitrary dynamic\nenvironments. RTD-D first computes a Forward Reachable Set (FRS) offline of the\nrobot tracking parameterized desired trajectories that include fail-safe\nmaneuvers. Then, for online receding-horizon planning, the method provides a\nway to discretize predictions of an arbitrary dynamic environment to enable\nreal-time collision checking. The FRS is used to map these discretized\npredictions to trajectories that the robot can track while provably\nnot-at-fault. One such trajectory is chosen at each iteration, or the robot\nexecutes the fail-safe maneuver from its previous trajectory which is\nguaranteed to be not at fault. RTD-D is shown to produce not-at-fault behavior\nover thousands of simulations and several real-world hardware demonstrations on\ntwo robots: a Segway, and a small electric vehicle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 21:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-11"}

The goal of this paper is to use ideas from rigidity theory\nto study uniqueness of nonnegative matrix factorizations in the case when\nnonnegative rank of a matrix is equal to its rank. We characterize\ninfinitesimally rigid nonnegative factorizations, prove that a nonnegative\nfactorization is infinitesimally rigid if and only if it is locally rigid and a\ncertain matrix achieves its maximal possible Kruskal rank, and show that\nlocally rigid nonnegative factorizations can be extended to globally rigid\nnonnegative factorizations.

In this setting, controlling the false discovery rate\n(FDR), which is the expected proportion of type I error, is an important\nchallenge for making meaningful inferences. In this paper, we consider the\nproblem of controlling FDR in an online manner. Concretely, we consider an\nordered, possibly infinite, sequence of hypotheses, arriving one at each\ntimestep, and for each hypothesis we observe a p-value along with a set of\nfeatures specific to that hypothesis. The decision whether or not to reject the\ncurrent hypothesis must be made immediately at each timestep, before the next\nhypothesis is observed. The model of multi-dimensional feature set provides a\nvery general way of leveraging the auxiliary information in the data which\nhelps in maximizing the number of discoveries.\n  We propose a new class of powerful online testing procedures, where the\nrejections thresholds (significance levels) are learnt sequentially by\nincorporating contextual information and previous results.

We then\nfocus on a subclass of these procedures, based on weighting significance\nlevels, to derive a practical algorithm that learns a parametric weight\nfunction in an online fashion to gain more discoveries.

While this has proven effective for specific tasks\nwith well-defined objectives (e.g., games), it has never been established that\nfixed discounting is suitable for general purpose use (e.g., as a model of\nhuman preferences).

It addresses the following question: Can machine\nlearning be applied to model individual taste heterogeneity (preference\nheterogeneity for travel modes and response heterogeneity to travel attributes)\nin travel mode choice? This paper first develops a high-accuracy classifier to\npredict mode-switching behavior under a hypothetical Mobility-on-Demand Transit\nsystem (i.e., stated-preference data), which represents the case study\nunderlying this research. We show that this classifier naturally captures\nindividual heterogeneity available in the data.

It is expected to affect any neutral plasma with moderate to strong\nCoulomb coupling such as ultracold neutral plasmas (UNP) and the dense plasmas\nof ICF and laser-matter interaction experiments. The physical mechanism\nresponsible is screening of binary collisions by the correlated plasma medium,\nwhich causes an asymmetry in the dynamics of large-angle scattering. Because\nthe effect pertains only to close interactions, it is not predicted by\ntraditional transport models based on cut-off Coulomb collisions or linear\ndielectric response. A model for the effective screened interaction potential\nis presented that is suitable for the coupling strengths achieved in UNP\nexperiments. Transport calculations based on this potential and the effective\npotential kinetic theory agree with simulated relaxation rates and predict that\nthe Barkas effect can cause up to a 70% increase in the electron-ion collision\nrate at the conditions of present UNP experiments.

Methods of constructing generative models need to overcome this\ntendency. We consider a simple method of summarizing the prediction error, such\nthat the optimal strategy corresponds to outputting a distribution of\npredictions with a support that matches the support of the distribution of\ntargets --- optimizing against the minimal value of the loss given a set of\nsamples from the prediction distribution, rather than the mean. We show that\nmodels trained against this loss learn to capture the support of the target\ndistribution and, when combined with an auxiliary classifier-like prediction\ntask, can be projected via rejection sampling to reproduce the full\ndistribution of targets. The resulting method works well compared to other\ngenerative modeling approaches particularly in low dimensional spaces with\nhighly non-trivial distributions, due to mode collapse solutions being globally\nsuboptimal with respect to the extreme value loss.

To avoid this undesirable behavior, we propose to\ndirectly learn decision policies that maximize utility under fairness\nconstraints and thereby take into account how decisions affect which data is\nobserved in the future.

They demonstrate how current solutions are not easily\nrepeatable and adaptable across systems and how in most cases, the related\nstandards such as ISO/IEC 25010 or Automotive-SPICE to cite just a few, are not\nused as they are within companies today. Fortunately, qualimetry, a young\nscience with the purpose of quality quantification, provides the tools to\nresolve these gaps. To be able to use these tools, the authors propose a\nsynthetic representation of qualimetry and its six pillars, named the ''House\nof Qualimetry'' and explain the fundamendal aspects of qualimetry. They\nidentify a set of 8 attributes to characterize the design quality model and\nbased on these attributes, propose a new process to design or adapt the quality\nmodel. Among these attributes, a new one is introduced to capture and measure\nthe quality model evolution and adaptation aspect: the polymorphism and the\npolymorphism degree.

The computation of precise, unbiased, photometric\nredshifts up to z = 2, at least, is one of the main LSST challenges and its\nperformance will have major impact on all extragalactic LSST sciences. We\nevaluate the efficiency of our photometric redshift reconstruction on mock\ngalaxy catalogs up to z=2.45 and estimate the impact of realistic photometric\nredshift (hereafter photo-z) reconstruction on the large-scale structures (LSS)\npower spectrum and the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale determination\nfor a LSST-like photometric survey.

We have computed the\nfractional error on the recovered power spectrum which is dominated by the\nshot-noise at z>1 for scales k>0.1, due to the photo-z damping. The BAO scale\ncan be recovered with a percent or better accuracy level from z = 0.5 to z =\n1.5 using realistic photo-z reconstruction. Outliers can represent a\nsignificant fraction of galaxies at z>2, causing bias and errors on LSS power\nspectrum measurement. Although the BAO scale is not the most powerful\ncosmological probe in LSST, it can be used to check the consistency of the LSS\nmeasurement. Moreover we show that the impact of photo-z smearing on the\nrecovered isotropic BAO scale in LSST should stay limited up to z=1.5, so as\nlong as the galaxy number density balances the photo-z smoothing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 10:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

It has been reported clinically that rupture or dissections in\nthoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) often occur due to hypertension which may be\nmodelled with sudden increase of peripheral resistance, inducing acute changes\nof blood volumes in the aorta. There is clinical evidence that more compliant\naneurysms are less prone to rupture as they can sustain such changes of volume.\nThe aim of the current paper is to verify this paradigm by evaluating\ncomputationally the role played by the variation of peripheral resistance and\nthe impact of aortic stiffness onto peak wall stress in ascending TAA. Methods.\nFluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) analyses were performed using\npatient-specific geometries and boundary conditions derived from 4D MRI\ndatasets acquired on a patient. Blood was assumed incompressible and was\ntreated as a non-Newtonian fluid using the Carreau model while the wall\nmechanical properties were obtained from the bulge inflation tests carried out\nin vitro after surgical repair. The Navier Stokes equations were solved in\nANSYS Fluent. The Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulation was used to account\nfor the wall deformations. At the interface between the solid domain and the\nfluid domain, the fluid pressure was transferred to the wall and the\ndisplacement of the wall was transferred to the fluid. The two systems were\nconnected by the System Coupling component which controls the solver execution\nof fluid and solid simulations in ANSYS. Fluid and solid domains were solved\nsequentially starting from the fluid simulations. Results. Distributions of\nblood flow, wall shear stress and wall stress were evaluated in the ascending\nthoracic aorta using the FSI analyses. We always observed a significant flow\neccentricity in the simulations, in very good agreement with velocity profiles\nmeasured using 4D MRI. The results also showed significant increase of peak\nwall stress due to the increase of peripheral resistance and aortic stiffness.\nIn the worst case scenario, the largest peripheral resistance (10 10 kg.s.m-4)\nand stiffness (10 MPa) resulted in a maximal principal stress equal to 702 kPa,\nwhereas it was only 77 kPa in normal conditions. Conclusions. This is the first\ntime that the risk of rupture of an aTAA is quantified in case of the combined\neffects of hypertension and aortic stiffness increase. Our findings suggest\nthat a stiffer TAA may have the most altered distribution of wall stress and an\nacute change of peripheral vascular resistance could significantly increase the\nrisk of rupture for a stiffer aneurysm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 10:32:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-11"}

In the molecular\nhypothesis the $X(3872)$ resonance is a $1^{++}$ $D^*\\bar{D}$ bound state. If\nthis is the case, the application of heavy-quark symmetry to a molecular\n$X(3872)$ suggests the existence of a series of partner states, the most\nobvious of which is a possible $2^{++}$ $D^*\\bar{D}^*$ bound state for which\nthe two-body potential is identical to that of the $1^{++}$ $D^*\\bar{D}$\nsystem, the reason being that these two heavy hadron-antihadron states have\nidentical light-spin content. As already discussed in the literature this leads\nto the prediction of a partner state at $4012\\,{\\rm MeV}$, at least in the\nabsence of other dynamical effects which might affect the location of this\nmolecule. However the prediction of further heavy-quark symmetry partners\ncannot be done solely on the basis of symmetry and requires additional\ninformation. We propose to use the one boson exchange model to fill this gap,\nin which case we will be able to predict or discard the existence of other\npartner states. Besides the isoscalar $2^{++}$ $D^*\\bar{D}^*$ bound state, we\ncorrectly reproduce the location and quantum numbers of the isovector\nhidden-bottom $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$ molecular candidates. We also\npredict the hidden-bottom $1^{++}$ $B^*\\bar{B}^*$ and $2^{++}$ $B^*\\bar{B}^*$\npartners of the $X(3872)$, in agreement with previous theoretical speculations,\nplus a series of other states. The isoscalar, doubly charmed $1^+$ $D D^*$ and\n$D^* D^*$ molecules and their doubly bottomed counterparts are likely to bind,\nproviding a few instances of explicitly exotic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 12:11:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 02:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}

In this work, we apply our non-spherical dynamical\nmodels to the kinematic data of eight classical dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) to\nobtain more reliable and realistic limits on ULA particle mass. This is\nmotivated by the reasons that the light distributions of the dSphs are not\nspherical, nor are the shapes of dark matter haloes predicted by ULA dark\nmatter simulations. Compared with the previous studies on ULA dark matter\nassuming spherical mass models, our result is less stringent than those\nconstraints due to the uncertainties on non-sphericity. On the other hand,\nremarkably, we find that the dSphs would prefer to have a flattened dark matter\nhalo rather than a spherical one, especially Draco favours a strongly elongated\ndark matter halo caused naively by the assumption of a soliton-core profile.\nMoreover, our consequent non-spherical core profiles are much more flattened\nthan numerical predictions based on ULA dark matter, even though there are\nstill uncertainties on the estimation of dark matter halo structure.

As\nassociated groups of link quandles are link groups, which are known to be\nresidually finite, it follows that link quandles are residually finite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 14:02:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 14:10:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 09:11:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 16:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-06"}

In recent and future experiments,\n$\\alpha$-knockout data are available for neutron-rich beryllium isotopes. In\n$^{12}$Be , rich phenomena are induced by the formation of $\\alpha$-clusters\nsurrounded by neutrons, for instance, breaking of the neutron magic number\n$N=8$.\n  Purpose: Our objective is to provide direct probing of the $\\alpha$-cluster\nformation in the $^{12}$Be target through associating the structure information\nobtained by a microscopic theory with the experimental observables of\n$\\alpha$-knockout reactions.\n  Method: We formulate a new wave function of the\nTohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-R{\\\"o}pke (THSR) type for the structure calculation of\n${}^{12}$Be nucleus and integrate it with the distorted wave impulse\napproximation framework for the $\\alpha$-knockout reaction calculation of\n$^{12}$Be$(p,p\\alpha)^{8}$He.\n  Results: We reproduce the low-lying spectrum of the $^{12}$Be nucleus using\nthe THSR wave function and discuss the cluster structure of the ground state.\nBased on the microscopic wave function, the optical potentials and\n$\\alpha$-cluster wave function are determined and utilized in the calculation\nof ${}^{12}$Be($p,p\\alpha$)${}^{8}$He reaction at 250 MeV. The possibility of\nprobing the clustering state of $^{12}$Be through this reaction is demonstrated\nby analysis of the triple differential cross sections that are sensitively\ndependent on the $\\alpha$-cluster amplitude at the nuclear surface.\n  Conclusions: This study provides a feasible approach to validate directly the\ntheoretical predictions of clustering features in the $^{12}$Be nucleus through\nthe $\\alpha$-knockout reaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 14:49:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 05:53:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 15:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

In fuzzy clustering, object's membership values should sum to 1.\nHence, any object may obtain full membership in at most one cluster.\nPossibilistic clustering methods remove this restriction. However, BFPM differs\nfrom previous fuzzy and possibilistic clustering approaches by allowing the\nmembership function to take larger values with respect to all clusters.\nFurthermore, in BFPM, a data object can have full membership in multiple\nclusters or even in all clusters. BFPM relaxes the boundary conditions\n(restrictions) in membership assignment. The proposed methodology satisfies the\nnecessity of obtaining full memberships and overcomes the issues with\nconventional methods on dealing with overlapping. Analysing the objects'\nmovements from their own cluster to another (mutation) is also proposed in this\npaper. BFPM has been applied in different domains in geometry, set theory,\nanomaly detection, risk management, diagnosis diseases, and other disciplines.\nValidity and comparison indexes have been also used to evaluate the accuracy of\nBFPM. BFPM has been evaluated in terms of accuracy, fuzzification constant\n(different norms), objects' movement analysis, and covering diversity. The\npromising results prove the importance of considering the proposed methodology\nin learning methods to track the behaviour of data objects, in addition to\nobtain accurate results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 14:53:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-11"}

Second, we consider multi-antenna systems to combat fading and\nimprove the transmission reliability. The resulting performance improvement\n(known as diversity) does not require additional bandwidth nor power. Achieving\ndiversity using multiple antennas at the receiver (receive diversity) is proved\nto be a much simpler task than using multiple antennas at the transmitter\n(transmit diversity).

For neutron inelastic\nscatterings-induced DPA, the first order Legendre polynomial is sufficient for\nboth fission and fusion reactors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 10:03:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 20:12:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}

Being able to predict unseen links with good accuracy has important\napplications in several domains such as social media, security, transportation,\nand recommendation systems. A common approach is to use features based on the\ncommon neighbors of an unconnected pair of nodes to predict whether the pair\nwill form a link in the future. In this paper, we present an approach for link\nprediction that relies on higher-order analysis of the graph topology, well\nbeyond common neighbors. We treat the link prediction problem as a supervised\nclassification problem, and we propose a set of features that depend on the\npatterns or motifs that a pair of nodes occurs in. By using motifs of sizes 3,\n4, and 5, our approach captures a high level of detail about the graph topology\nwithin the neighborhood of the pair of nodes, which leads to a higher\nclassification accuracy. In addition to proposing the use of motif-based\nfeatures, we also propose two optimizations related to constructing the\nclassification dataset from the graph. First, to ensure that positive and\nnegative examples are treated equally when extracting features, we propose\nadding the negative examples to the graph as an alternative to the common\napproach of removing the positive ones. Second, we show that it is important to\ncontrol for the shortest-path distance when sampling pairs of nodes to form\nnegative examples, since the difficulty of prediction varies with the\nshortest-path distance. We experimentally demonstrate that using off-the-shelf\nclassifiers with a well constructed classification dataset results in up to 10\npercentage points increase in accuracy over prior topology-based and feature\nlearning methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 10:01:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 18:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-08"}

Therefore, in this article, we introduced a new model to refine the\npositioning accuracy of mobile devices using only CDR data and coverage areas\nlocations. The adopted method has three steps: first, we discovered which model\nof movement (Move, Stay) is associated with the coverage areas where the mobile\ndevice was connected using a Kalman filter. Then, simultaneously we estimated\nthe location or the position of the device. Finally, we applied map-matching to\nbring the positioning to the right road segment. The results are very\nencouraging; nevertheless, there is some enhancement that can be done at the\nlevel of movement models and map matching. For example by introducing more\nsophisticated movement model based on data-driven modeling and a map matching\nthat uses the movement model type detected by matching \"Stay\" location to\nbuildings and \"Move\" model to roads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 10:58:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-26"}

Because of the increase in the cost of\nraw materials and energy carriers, the reuse of large portions of reclaimed\nasphalt pavement (RAP) is critical in reducing both the cost and environmental\nfootprint of asphalt pavements. High-RAP mixtures are more prone to low\ntemperature cracking and poor mixture workability because of the higher\nstiffness of RAP binder. Recycling agents are one of the additives which are\nused to improve these deficiencies. However, there is some ambiguity about the\noptimum content of recycling agent to assure proper performance of recycled\nasphalt pavement during its service life. The current study used 60% and 100%\nfractionated RAP with waste cooking oil as a recycling agent and crumb rubber\nto alleviate the aforementioned problems. Laboratory evaluation showed that\nincreasing the amount of recycling agent in the high-RAP mixtures improved\ntheir workability and low temperature performance while decreasing moisture\ndamage and rutting resistance. The long-term susceptibility to aging of\nrecycled binder with the organically-based recycling agent was also\ninvestigated. A procedure to obtain the optimum percentage of recycling agent\nwas devised to strike a balance between the performance characteristics of\nmixtures with a high-RAP content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 04:34:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-03"}
