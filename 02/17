Integrative analysis of multiple heterogeneous studies is,\nhowever, highly challenging in the ultra high dimensional setting. The\nchallenge is even more pronounced when the individual level data cannot be\nshared across studies, known as DataSHIELD constraint (Wolfson et al., 2010).\nUnder sparse regression models that are assumed to be similar yet not identical\nacross studies, we propose in this paper a novel integrative estimation\nprocedure for data-Shielding High-dimensional Integrative Regression (SHIR).\nSHIR protects individual data through summary-statistics-based integrating\nprocedure, accommodates between study heterogeneity in both the covariate\ndistribution and model parameters, and attains consistent variable selection.\nTheoretically, SHIR is statistically more efficient than the existing\ndistributed approaches that integrate debiased LASSO estimators from the local\nsites. Furthermore, the estimation error incurred by aggregating derived data\nis negligible compared to the statistical minimax rate and SHIR is shown to be\nasymptotically equivalent in estimation to the ideal estimator obtained by\nsharing all data. The finite-sample performance of our method is studied and\ncompared with existing approaches via extensive simulation settings. We further\nillustrate the utility of SHIR to derive phenotyping algorithms for coronary\nartery disease using electronic health records data from multiple chronic\ndisease cohorts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Feb 2019 16:01:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 15:20:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 16:56:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

This approach is different from the action-based perspective of\ncommon PDDL-like planning languages. Timeline-based systems have been\nsuccessfully deployed in a number of space missions and other domains. However,\ndespite this practical success, a thorough theoretical understanding of the\nparadigm was missing.\n  This thesis fills this gap, providing the first detailed account of formal\nand computational properties of the timeline-based approach to planning. In\nparticular, we show that a particularly restricted variant of the formalism is\nalready expressive enough to compactly capture action-based temporal planning\nproblems. Then, finding a solution plan for a timeline-based planning problem\nis proved to be EXPSPACE-complete.\n  Then, we study the problem of timeline-based planning with uncertainty, that\ninclude external components whose behaviour is not under the control of the\nplanned system. We identify a few issues in the state-of-the-art approach based\non flexible plans, proposing timeline-based games, a more general\ngame-theoretic formulation of the problem, that addresses those issues. We show\nthat winning strategies for such games can be found in doubly-exponential time.\n  Then, we study the expressiveness of the formalism from a logic point of\nview, showing that (most of) timeline-based planning problems can be captured\nby Bounded TPTL with Past, a fragment of TPTL+P that, unlike the latter, keeps\nan EXPSPACE satisfiability problem.

The case of long range interactions\n$J(r)$ has been widely studied at equilibrium but their effect on relaxation is\na much less investigated field. Here we make a detailed numerical and\nanalytical study of both cases, NCOP and COP. Many results are valid for any\npositive, decreasing coupling $J(r)$, but we focus specifically on the\nexponential case, $J_{exp}(r)=e^{-r/R}$ with varying $R>0$, and on the\nintegrable power law case, $J_{pow}(r) =1/r^{1+\\sigma}$ with $\\sigma > 0$. We\nfind that the {\\it asymptotic} growth law $L(t)$ is the usual algebraic one,\n$L(t)\\sim t^{1/z}$, of the corresponding model with nearest neighborg\ninteraction ($z_{NCOP}=2$ and $z_{COP}=3$) for all models except $J_{pow}$ for\nsmall $\\sigma$: in the non conserved case when $\\sigma\\le 1$\n($z_{NCOP}=\\sigma+1$) and in the conserved case when $\\sigma\\to 0^+$\n($z_{COP}=4\\beta+3$, where $\\beta=1/T$ is the inverse of the absolute\ntemperature). The models with space decaying interactions also differ markedly\nfrom the ones with nearest neighbors due to the presence of many long-lasting\npreasymptotic regimes, such as an exponential mean-field behavior with\n$L(t)\\sim e^{t}$, a ballistic one with $L(t)\\sim t$, a slow (logarithmic)\nbehavior $L(t)\\sim \\ln t$ and one with $L(t)\\sim t^{1/\\sigma+1}$. All these\nregimes and their validity ranges have been found analytically and verified in\nnumerical simulations. Our results show that the main effect of the\nconservation law is a strong slowdown of COP dynamics if interactions have an\nextended range.

Divergences from\nthat model would indicate new physics, such as dark matter decay (heating) or\nbaryonic cooling beyond that expected from adiabatic expansion of the Universe.\nIn the early Universe, most of the baryonic matter was in the form of neutral\nhydrogen (HI), detectable via its ground state's spin-flip transition. A\nmeasurement of the redshifted 21-cm spectrum maps the history of the HI gas\nthrough the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn and up to the Epoch of Reionization\n(EoR). The Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature (EDGES) recently\nreported an absorption trough at 78 MHz (redshift z of 17), similar in\nfrequency to expectations for Cosmic Dawn, but about 3 times deeper than was\nthought possible from standard cosmology and adiabatic cooling of HI.\nInteractions between baryons and slightly-charged dark matter particles with\nelectron-like mass provide a potential explanation of this difference but other\ncooling mechanisms are also being investigated to explain these results. The\nCosmic Dawn trough is affected by cosmology and the complex astrophysical\nhistory of the first luminous objects. Another trough is expected during the\nDark Ages, prior to the formation of the first stars and thus determined\nentirely by cosmological phenomena (including dark matter).

A critical factor affecting the\nfuture large-scale adoption of such mobile crowd-learning applications is the\nfreshness of the crowd-learned information, which can be measured by a metric\ntermed ``age-of-information'' (AoI). However, we show that the AoI of mobile\ncrowd-learning could be arbitrarily bad under selfish users' behaviors if the\nsystem is poorly designed. This motivates us to design efficient reward\nmechanisms to incentivize mobile users to report information in time, with the\ngoal of keeping the AoI and congestion level of each PoI low. Toward this end,\nwe consider a simple linear AoI-based reward mechanism and analyze its AoI and\ncongestion performances in terms of price of anarchy (PoA), which characterizes\nthe degradation of the system efficiency due to selfish behavior of users.\nRemarkably, we show that the proposed mechanism achieves the optimal AoI\nperformance asymptotically in a deterministic scenario. Further, we prove that\nthe proposed mechanism achieves a bounded PoA in general stochastic cases, and\nthe bound only depends on system parameters. Particularly, when the service\nrates of PoIs are symmetric in stochastic cases, the achieved PoA is\nupper-bounded by $1/2$ asymptotically. Collectively, this work advances our\nunderstanding of information freshness in mobile crowd-learning systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Feb 2019 20:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-19"}

However, in some\nmachine learning problems such as the bandit model and the black-box learning\nproblem, proximal gradient method could fail because the explicit gradients of\nthese problems are difficult or infeasible to obtain. The gradient-free\n(zeroth-order) method can address these problems because only the objective\nfunction values are required in the optimization. Recently, the first\nzeroth-order proximal stochastic algorithm was proposed to solve the nonconvex\nnonsmooth problems. However, its convergence rate is $O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}})$\nfor the nonconvex problems, which is significantly slower than the best\nconvergence rate $O(\\frac{1}{T})$ of the zeroth-order stochastic algorithm,\nwhere $T$ is the iteration number. To fill this gap, in the paper, we propose a\nclass of faster zeroth-order proximal stochastic methods with the variance\nreduction techniques of SVRG and SAGA, which are denoted as ZO-ProxSVRG and\nZO-ProxSAGA, respectively. In theoretical analysis, we address the main\nchallenge that an unbiased estimate of the true gradient does not hold in the\nzeroth-order case, which was required in previous theoretical analysis of both\nSVRG and SAGA. Moreover, we prove that both ZO-ProxSVRG and ZO-ProxSAGA\nalgorithms have $O(\\frac{1}{T})$ convergence rates.

However, the advantage relies on the availability of the downlink\nchannel state information (CSI) of multiple users, which is still a challenge\nin frequency-division-duplex transmission systems. This paper aims to solve\nthis problem by developing a full transceiver framework that includes downlink\nchannel training (or estimation), CSI feedback, and channel reconstruction\nschemes. Our framework provides accurate reconstruction results for multiple\nusers with small amounts of training and feedback overhead. Specifically, we\nfirst develop an enhanced Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (eNOMP)\nalgorithm to extract the frequency-independent parameters (i.e., downtilts,\nazimuths, and delays) from the uplink. Then, by leveraging the information from\nthese frequency-independent parameters, we develop an efficient downlink\ntraining scheme to estimate the downlink channel gains for multiple users. This\ntraining scheme offers an acceptable estimation error rate of the gains with a\nlimited pilot amount. Numerical results verify the precision of the eNOMP\nalgorithm and demonstrate that the sum-rate performance of the system using the\nreconstructed downlink channel can approach that of the system using perfect\nCSI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Feb 2019 23:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-19"}

We frame this problem as one of mediation analysis to evaluate\nthe extent to which the effect of a particular control technology on ambient\npollution is mediated through causal effects on power plant emissions. Since\npower plants emit various compounds that contribute to ambient pollution, we\ndevelop new methods for multiple intermediate variables that are measured\ncontemporaneously, may interact with one another, and may exhibit joint\nmediating effects.

The idea\nof making secret sharing non-malleable received great attention and by now has\ngenerated many papers exploring new frontiers in this topic, such as\nmultiple-time tampering and adding leakage resiliency to the one-shot tampering\nmodel. Non-compartmentalized tampering model was first studied by Agrawal et.al\n(CRYPTO15) for non-malleability against permutation composed with bit-wise\nindependent tampering, and shown useful in constructing non-malleable string\ncommitments. We initiate the study of leakage-resilient secret sharing in the\nnon-compartmentalized model. The leakage adversary can corrupt several players\nand obtain their shares, as in normal secret sharing. The leakage adversary can\napply arbitrary affine functions with bounded total output length to the full\nshare vector and obtain the outputs as leakage. These two processes can be both\nnon-adaptive and do not depend on each other, or both adaptive and depend on\neach other with arbitrary ordering.

Methods that spectrally map spin relaxation processes provide insight\ninto their origin and can motivate methods to mitigate them. In this paper,\nusing a combination of hyperpolarization and precision field cycling over a\nwide range (1mT-7T), we map frequency dependent relaxation in a prototypical\nhybrid system of 13C nuclear spins in diamond coupled to Nitrogen Vacancy\ncenters. Nuclear hyperpolarization through the optically pumped NV electrons\nallows signal time savings for the measurements exceeding million-fold over\nconventional methods. We observe that 13C lifetimes show a dramatic field\ndependence, growing rapidly with field up to 100mT and saturating thereafter.\nThrough a systematic study with increasing substitutional electron (P1 center)\nconcentration as well as 13C enrichment levels, we identify the operational\nrelaxation channels for the nuclei in different field regimes. In particular,\nwe demonstrate the dominant role played by the 13C nuclei coupling to the\ninteracting P1 electronic spin bath.

Models with energy added in the\ncore develop a surface shock breakout that propels an initial, higher-speed\nejecta ($>$5000km s$^{-1}$), but the bulk of the ejected material still follows\nthe same exponential similarity scalings with ${\\bar v} \\approx v_{\\rm esc}$. A\nbroader parameter study examines how the ejected mass and energy depends on the\nenergy-addition factor $f$, for three distinct model series that locate the\nadded energy in either the core, envelope, or near-surface. We conclude by\ndiscussing the relevance of these results for understanding LBV outbursts and\nother eruptive phenomena, such as failed supernovae and pulsational pair\ninstability events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Feb 2019 08:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

Online matching\nbetween idle drivers and waiting passengers is one of the most key components\nin a ride-sourcing system. The average pickup distance or time is an important\nmeasurement of system efficiency since it affects both passengers' waiting time\nand drivers' utilization rate. It is naturally expected that a more effective\nbipartite matching (with smaller average pickup time) can be implemented if the\nplatform accumulates more idle drivers and waiting passengers in the matching\npool. A specific passenger request can also benefit from a delayed matching\nsince he/she may be matched with closer idle drivers after waiting for a few\nseconds. Motivated by the potential benefits of delayed matching, this paper\nestablishes a two-stage framework which incorporates a combinatorial\noptimization and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning methods. The\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning methods are used to dynamically determine\nthe delayed time for each passenger request (or the time at which each request\nenters the matching pool), while the combinatorial optimization conducts an\noptimal bipartite matching between idle drivers and waiting passengers in the\nmatching pool. Two reinforcement learning methods, spatio-temporal multi-agent\ndeep Q learning (ST-M-DQN) and spatio-temporal multi-agent actor-critic\n(ST-M-A2C) are developed.

Experimental results on FPQF and KQF\nforms, as well as FPRM and KRM classical forms, applied to various target gates\nsuch as NOT, V, V+, Hadamard, and Pauli rotations, demonstrate that FPQF and\nKQF forms greatly reduce the gate cost of quantum multiplexers in both randomly\ngenerated data and FPRM benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Feb 2019 09:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-19"}

This\nmay lead to suboptimal performance, since a practical KG can hardly be\ncomplete, and it is common that a KG has missing facts, relations, and\nentities. Thus, we argue that it is crucial to consider the incomplete nature\nof KG when incorporating it into recommender system.\n  In this paper, we jointly learn the model of recommendation and knowledge\ngraph completion. Distinct from previous KG-based recommendation methods, we\ntransfer the relation information in KG, so as to understand the reasons that a\nuser likes an item.

Among the literature of both the\ntransfer learning and the potential-based reward shaping, a subject that has\nnever been addressed is the knowledge gathered during the learning process\nitself. In this paper, we presented a novel potential-based reward shaping\nmethod that attempted to extract knowledge from the learning process. The\nproposed method extracts knowledge from episodes' cumulative rewards. The\nproposed method has been evaluated in the Arcade learning environment and the\nresults indicate an improvement in the learning process in both the single-task\nand the multi-task reinforcement learner agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Feb 2019 10:34:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 07:49:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 22:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

The integrative analysis of such data sets not only provides us with\nthe opportunity of a deeper understanding of the studied system, but also\nintroduces some new statistical challenges. First, the separation of\ninformation that is common across all or some of the data sets, and the\ninformation that is specific to each data set is problematic. Furthermore,\nthese data sets are often a mix of quantitative and discrete (binary or\ncategorical) data types, while commonly used data fusion methods require all\ndata sets to be quantitative. In this paper, we propose an exponential family\nsimultaneous component analysis (ESCA) model to tackle the potential mixed data\ntypes problem of multiple data sets. In addition, a structured sparse pattern\nof the loading matrix is induced through a nearly unbiased group concave\npenalty to disentangle the global, local common and distinct information of the\nmultiple data sets.

Analytic solutions are derived for updating all the\nparameters of the model in each iteration, and the algorithm will decrease the\nobjective function in each iteration monotonically.

To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel Attribute Manifold Encoding GAN\n(AME-GAN) for fully-featured attribute transfer, which can modify and adjust\nevery detail in the images. Specifically, our method divides the input image\ninto image attribute part and image background part on manifolds, which are\ncontrolled by attribute latent variables and background latent variables\nrespectively. Through enforcing attribute latent variables to Gaussian\ndistributions and background latent variables to uniform distributions\nrespectively, the attribute transfer procedure becomes controllable and image\ngeneration is more photo-realistic. Furthermore, we adopt a conditional\nmulti-scale discriminator to render accurate and high-quality target attribute\nimages.

Accurate velocity models are key prerequisites for reverse-time\nmigration and other high-resolution seismic imaging techniques. Such velocity\ninformation has traditionally been derived by tomography or full-waveform\ninversion (FWI), which are time consuming and computationally expensive, and\nthey rely heavily on human interaction and quality control. We investigate a\nnovel method based on the supervised deep fully convolutional neural network\n(FCN) for velocity-model building (VMB) directly from raw seismograms. Unlike\nthe conventional inversion method based on physical models, the supervised\ndeep-learning methods are based on big-data training rather than\nprior-knowledge assumptions. During the training stage, the network establishes\na nonlinear projection from the multi-shot seismic data to the corresponding\nvelocity models. During the prediction stage, the trained network can be used\nto estimate the velocity models from the new input seismic data. One key\ncharacteristic of the deep-learning method is that it can automatically extract\nmulti-layer useful features without the need for human-curated activities and\ninitial velocity setup. The data-driven method usually requires more time\nduring the training stage, and actual predictions take less time, with only\nseconds needed. Therefore, the computational time of geophysical inversions,\nincluding real-time inversions, can be dramatically reduced once a good\ngeneralized network is built. By using numerical experiments on synthetic\nmodels, the promising performances of our proposed method are shown in\ncomparison with conventional FWI even when the input data are in more realistic\nscenarios.

We\nhave calculated the electronic structures and the electron-phonon coupling for\nhoneycomb borophene by explicitly considering the substrate effect using\nfirst-principles density functional theory in conjunction with the Wannier\ninterpolation technique. We find that the $sp^2$-hybridized $\\sigma$-bonding\nbands of honeycomb borophene are metallized due to moderate charge transfer\nfrom the Al substrate, similar as in MgB$_2$. However, the electron-phonon\ncoupling in honeycomb borophene is much weaker than in MgB$_2$ due to the\nhardening of the bond-stretching boron phonon modes and the reduction of phonon\ndensity of states. Nevertheless, the interlayer coupling between Al-associated\nphonons and electrons in borophene is strong. Based on this observation, we\npredict that a 6.5 K superconducting transition can be observed in a\nfree-standing borophene decorated by a single Al layer, namely monolayer\nAlB$_2$. Accordingly, similar superconducting transition temperature could be\nexpected in honeycomb borophene on Al(111).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Feb 2019 15:28:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 09:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-12"}

The\ntraditional Mean-Variance model introduced by Harry Markowitz has been the\nbasis of many models used to solve the portfolio optimization problem. The\noverall goal is to achieve the highest return and lowest risk in portfolio\noptimization problems. In this paper, we will present an optimal portfolio\nbased the Markowitz Mean-Variance-Skewness with weight constraints model for\nshort-term investment opportunities in Iran's stock market. We will use a\nneural network based predictor to predict the stock returns and measure the\nrisk of stocks based on the prediction errors in the neural network. We will\nperform a series of experiments on our portfolio optimization model with the\nreal data from Iran's stock market indices including Bank, Insurance,\nInvestment, Petroleum Products and Chemicals indices. Finally, 8 different\nportfolios with low, medium and high risks for different type of investors\n(risk-averse or risk taker) using genetic algorithm will be designed and\nanalyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Feb 2019 10:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-18"}

In order to give colleagues, politicians, and\ncitizens an idea, we present a view that is often followed when appointing\nprofessors for AI at German and international universities.
