While robot platforms provide means for interacting with the\nphysical world they cannot autonomously acquire object-level semantics without\nneeding human. In this paper, we investigate how to minimize human effort and\nintervention to teach robots perform real world tasks that incorporate\nsemantics. We study this question in the context of visual servoing of mobile\nrobots and propose DIViS, a Domain Invariant policy learning approach for\ncollision free Visual Servoing. DIViS incorporates high level semantics from\npreviously collected static human-labeled datasets and learns collision free\nservoing entirely in simulation and without any real robot data. However, DIViS\ncan directly be deployed on a real robot and is capable of servoing to the\nuser-specified object categories while avoiding collisions in the real world.\nDIViS is not constrained to be queried by the final view of goal but rather is\nrobust to servo to image goals taken from initial robot view with high\nocclusions without this impairing its ability to maintain a collision free\npath. We show the generalization capability of DIViS on real mobile robots in\nmore than 90 real world test scenarios with various unseen object goals in\nunstructured environments. DIViS is compared to prior approaches via real world\nexperiments and rigorous tests in simulation.

We can monitor quantum information scrambling by measuring two\npowerful metrics, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and Loschmidt Echoes\n(LEs). While OTOCs reveal quantum information scrambling involving hundreds of\nspins, the LE decay quantifies, via the time scale T3, how well the scrambled\ninformation can be recovered through time reversal. We find that when the\ninteractions dominate the perturbation, the LE decay rate only depends on the\ninteractions themselves, T3 ~ T2, and not on the perturbation. Then, in an\nunbounded many-spin system, decoherence can achieve a perturbation-independent\nregime, with a rate only related to the local second moment of the Hamiltonian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 16:02:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

Earlier studies have shown that if one expresses the evolution in\nterms of the rapidity of the dilute projectile, the dominant anti-collinear\ncontributions can be resummed to all orders.

Using this new\nprocedure, we discover the presence of small-amplitude oscillations within the\nsame arcade with 8-minute and 10-minute periods prior and subsequent to the\nlarge-amplitude oscillations, respectively. Consequently, we identify these as\n\"decayless\" oscillations that have only been previously observed in non-flaring\nloop systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 16:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

By increasing the size of the unit cell and consequently, the\nperiodicity of the inserted atoms, we are able to minimize the carbon-carbon\ninteraction and therefore infer the changes in the electronic, vibrational and\nthermal behavior of the bilayer when the intercalated atoms do not interact\nwith each other.

The intuition is that two graphs G and H which\nare equivalent with respect to k-Q-IM-equivalence cannot be distinguished by a\nrefinement of k-tuples given by linear operators acting on vector spaces over\nfields of characteristic p, for any p in Q. These equivalences first appeared\nin the study of rank logic, but in fact they can be used to delimit the\nexpressive power of any extension of fixed-point logic with linear-algebraic\noperators. We define an infinitary logic with k variables and all\nlinear-algebraic operators over finite vector spaces of characteristic p in Q\nand show that the k-Q-IM-equivalence is the natural notion of elementary\nequivalence for this logic.\n  By means of a new and much deeper algebraic analysis of a generalized\nvariant, for any prime p, of the CFI-structures due to Cai, F\\\"urer, and\nImmerman, we prove that, as long as Q is not the set of all primes, there is no\nk such that k-Q-IM-equivalence is the same as isomorphism.

Hyperspectral imagery includes varying bands of images.\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most frequently used deep\nlearning based methods for visual data processing. The use of CNN for HSI\nclassification is also visible in recent works. These approaches are mostly\nbased on 2D CNN. Whereas, the HSI classification performance is highly\ndependent on both spatial and spectral information. Very few methods have\nutilized the 3D CNN because of increased computational complexity. This letter\nproposes a Hybrid Spectral Convolutional Neural Network (HybridSN) for HSI\nclassification. Basically, the HybridSN is a spectral-spatial 3D-CNN followed\nby spatial 2D-CNN. The 3D-CNN facilitates the joint spatial-spectral feature\nrepresentation from a stack of spectral bands. The 2D-CNN on top of the 3D-CNN\nfurther learns more abstract level spatial representation. Moreover, the use of\nhybrid CNNs reduces the complexity of the model compared to 3D-CNN alone. To\ntest the performance of this hybrid approach, very rigorous HSI classification\nexperiments are performed over Indian Pines, Pavia University and Salinas Scene\nremote sensing datasets. The results are compared with the state-of-the-art\nhand-crafted as well as end-to-end deep learning based methods.

The parameters of the prior and posterior are estimated from sparse\nobservations of the PDE model's states and the unknown functions themselves by\nmaximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO), a lower bound on the log marginal\nlikelihood of the observations.

The robustness of a property is the probability that this\nproperty holds on random subsets of the original data. We study four\nproperties: if an itemset is closed, free, non-derivable or totally shattered,\nand demonstrate how to compute the robustness analytically without actually\nsampling the data. Our concept of robustness has many advantages: Unlike\nstatistical approaches for reducing patterns, we do not assume a null\nhypothesis or any noise model and in contrast to noise tolerant or approximate\npatterns, the robust patterns for a given property are always a subset of the\npatterns with this property. If the underlying property is monotonic, then the\nmeasure is also monotonic, allowing us to efficiently mine robust itemsets. We\nfurther derive a parameter-free technique for ranking itemsets that can be used\nfor top-$k$ approaches.

However, in contrast to the electric dipoles,\nmagnetic dipoles contributed by magnons are more isolated from electromagnetic\nenvironment with negligible radiation in the vacuum, limiting their application\nin coherent communication by photons. Recently, strong interaction between\ncavity standing-wave photons and magnons has been reported, indicating the\npossible manipulation of magnon radiation via tailoring photon states. Here,\nwith loading an yttrium iron garnet sphere in a one-dimensional circular\nwaveguide cavity in the presence of both travelling and standing photon modes,\nwe demonstrate an efficient photon emissions from magnon and a significant\nmagnon radiative damping with radiation rate found to be proportional to the\nlocal density of states (LDOS) of photon. By modulating the LDOS including its\nmagnitude and/or polarization, we can flexibly tune the photon emission and\nmagnon radiative damping on demand. Our findings provide a general way in\nmanipulating photon emission from magnon radiation for harnessing energy and\nangular momentum generation, transfer and storage modulated by magnon in the\ncavity and waveguide electrodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 20:53:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 08:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

It is more\ncomprehensive than the five-moment equations with isotropic pressures and\nsignificantly less expensive than the ten-moment equations with a full pressure\ntensors. Similarly to the five- and ten-moment equations, the wave speeds are\nnaturally limited by the speed of light, which eliminates the issue of\nunlimited whistler wave speeds present in Hall magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).

This\npaper focuses on the latter problem - the seat inventory control problem -\ncasting it as a Markov Decision Process to be able to find the optimal policy.\nMultiple fare classes, concurrent continuous arrival of passengers of different\nfare classes, overbooking and random cancellations that are independent of\nclass have been considered in the model. We have addressed this problem using\nDeep Q-Learning with the goal of maximizing the reward for each flight\ndeparture. The implementation of this technique allows us to employ large\ncontinuous state space but also presents the potential opportunity to test on\nreal time airline data. To generate data and train the agent, a basic\nair-travel market simulator was developed. The performance of the agent in\ndifferent simulated market scenarios was compared against theoretically optimal\nsolutions and was found to be nearly close to the expected optimal revenue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 22:31:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 19:14:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-17"}

In addition, DNNs in commercial applications often need to\nsatisfy real-world design constraints such as size or number of parameters. To\nmake configuration easier, automatic machine learning (AutoML) systems for deep\nlearning have been developed, focusing mostly on optimization of\nhyperparameters.\n  This paper takes AutoML a step further. It introduces an evolutionary AutoML\nframework called LEAF that not only optimizes hyperparameters but also network\narchitectures and the size of the network.

Experimental results on medical image classification and natural\nlanguage analysis show that the framework can be used to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance.

The objective of this work is to investigate the\ndrastically different general circulation of such planets, with an emphasis on\nthe tropical Hadley circulation and the mid-latitude baroclinic eddy structure.\nWe use a 3D dry dynamic core model, accompanied by an eddy-free configuration\nand a generalized 2D Eady model. When the meridional temperature gradient $T_y$\nis reversed, the Hadley cell remains in the same direction, because the surface\nwind pattern and hence the associated meridional Ekman transport are not\nchanged, as required by the baroclinic eddy momentum transport. The Hadley cell\nunder reversed $T_y$ also becomes much shallower and weaker, even when the\nmagnitude of the gradient is the same as in the normal case. The shallowness is\ndue to the bottom-heavy structure of the baroclinic eddies in the reverse case,\nand the weakness is due to the weak wave activity. We propose a new mechanism\nto explain the mid-latitude eddy structure for both cases, and verify it using\nthe generalized Eady model. With seasonal variations included, the annual mean\ncirculation resembles that under perpetual annual mean setup.

Using instead\nan extrapolation of the channel from the measured uplink estimates to the\ndownlink frequency band completely removes this overhead. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the theoretical limits of channel extrapolation in frequency. We\nhighlight the advantage of basing the extrapolation on high-resolution channel\nestimation. A lower bound (LB) on the mean squared error (MSE) of the\nextrapolated channel is derived. A simplified LB is also proposed, giving\nphysical intuition on the SNR gain and extrapolation range that can be expected\nin practice. The validity of the simplified LB relies on the assumption that\nthe paths are well separated. The SNR gain then linearly improves with the\nnumber of receive antennas while the extrapolation performance penalty\nquadratically scales with the ratio of the frequency and the training\nbandwidth. The theoretical LB is numerically evaluated using a 3GPP channel\nmodel and we show that the LB can be reached by practical high-resolution\nparameter extraction algorithms.

In this\nstudy, we propose an extended super-exchange theory (ESET) related to\nsuperposed electronic states of cation in a specific path.

The reliability of ESET is verified via first-principles\ncalculation and previous experimental report as well, and its universality is\nalso demonstrated.

Most rendezvous algorithms in the\nliterature focused on constructing channel hopping (CH) sequences that\nguarantee finite maximum time-to-rendezvous (MTTR). However, these algorithms\nperform rather poorly in terms of the expected time-to-rendezvous (ETTR) even\nwhen compared to the simple random algorithm. In this paper, we propose the\nquasi-random (QR) CH algorithm that has a comparable ETTR to the random\nalgorithm and a comparable MTTR to the best bound in the literature. Our QR\nalgorithm does not require the unique identifier (ID) assumption and it is very\nsimple to implement in the symmetric, asynchronous, and heterogeneous setting\nwith multiple radios. In a CRN with $N$ commonly labelled channels, the MTTR of\nthe QR algorithm is bounded above by $9 M \\lceil n_1/m_1 \\rceil \\cdot \\lceil\nn_2/m_2 \\rceil$ time slots, where $n_1$ (resp. $n_2$) is the number of\navailable channels to user $1$ (resp. 2), $m_1$ (resp. $m_2$) is the number of\nradios for user $1$ (resp. 2), and $M=\\lceil \\lceil \\log_2 N \\rceil /4 \\rceil\n*5+6$. Such a bound is only slightly larger than the best $O((\\log \\log N)\n\\frac{n_1 n_2}{m_1 m_2})$ bound in the literature. When each SU has a single\nradio, the ETTR is bounded above by $\\frac{n_1 n_2}{G}+9Mn_1n_2 \\cdot\n(1-\\frac{G}{n_1 n_2})^M$, where $G$ is the number of common channels between\nthese two users. By conducting extensive simulations, we show that for both the\nMTTR and the ETTR, our algorithm is comparable to the simple random algorithm\nand it outperforms several existing algorithms in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 07:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

To be specific, two probabilistic metrics, namely, the\ncovert outage probability and the connectivity probability, are adopted to\ncharacterize the covertness and reliability of the transmission, respectively,\nand analytically tractable expressions for the two metrics are derived. The\nworst-case covert communication scenario is then investigated, {where the\nwardens invariably can maximize the covert outage probability by adjusting the\ndetection thresholds for their detectors}. Afterwards, the optimal transmit\npower and transmission rate are jointly designed to maximize the covert\nthroughput subject to a covertness constraint.

Observed variations depend on the first ionization potential (FIP)\nof the main elements of the Sun's atmosphere. High-FIP elements (>10 eV)\nmaintain photospheric abundances in the corona, whereas low-FIP elements have\nenhanced abundances. Conversely, inverse FIP (IFIP) refers to the enhancement\nof high-FIP or depletion of low-FIP elements. We use spatially resolved\nspectroscopic observations, specifically the Ar XIV/Ca XIV intensity ratio,\nfrom Hinode's Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer to investigate the\ndistribution and evolution of plasma composition within two confined flares in\na newly emerging, highly sheared active region. During the decay phase of the\nfirst flare, patches above the flare ribbons evolve from the FIP to the IFIP\neffect, while the flaring loop tops show a stronger FIP effect. The patch and\nloop compositions then evolve toward the pre-flare basal state. We propose an\nexplanation of how flaring in strands of highly sheared emerging magnetic\nfields can lead to flare-modulated IFIP plasma composition over coalescing\numbrae which are crossed by flare ribbons. Subsurface reconnection between the\ncoalescing umbrae leads to the depletion of low-FIP elements as a result of an\nincreased wave flux from below. This material is evaporated when the flare\nribbons cross the umbrae. Our results are consistent with the ponderomotive\nfractionation model (Laming2015) for the creation of IFIP-biased plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 08:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

In new\ndevelopments, deep generative models have been used for learning semantically\nmeaningful `disentangled' representations; that capture task relevant\nattributes while being invariant to other attributes. In this work, we explore\nthe geometry of popular generative models for disentangled representation\nlearning. We use several metrics to compare the properties of latent spaces of\ndisentangled representation models in terms of class separability and curvature\nof the latent-space.

The central part of the paper is\ndevoted to the detailed analysis of the subprincipal symbol; in particular, we\nderive its explicit small time asymptotic expansion. We present a general\ngeometric construction that allows one to visualise topological obstructions\nand describe their circumvention with the use of a complex-valued phase\nfunction. We illustrate the general framework with explicit examples in\ndimension two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 10:35:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 11:11:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 12:43:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 10:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-16"}

Specifically, the paper outlines a joint\ncrypto-transcoding scheme for secure transrating of a video bitstream. That is\nto say it generates new video bitrates, possibly as part of an HTTP Adaptive\nStreaming (HAS) content delivery network. The scheme will reduce the bitrate to\none or more lower desired bit-rate without consuming time in the\nencryption/decryption process, which would be the case when full encryption is\nused. In addition, the decryption key no longer needs to be exposed at\nintermediate middleboxes, including when transrating is performed in a cloud\ndatacenter.

The impact of the shape of the cross section,\nand hence the magnitude of the correction due to degeneracy, is also discussed.\nThis study shows that degeneracy in plasmas can significantly influence\nexperimental observables such as the emission spectra, and that these effects\ncan be included parametrically in well-established atomic physics codes.

The MMSE-JS exploits\nsome intentionally unused pilots to reduce the pilot contamination caused by\nthe jammer.

In this paper, we investigate the spin evolution of\nMBHs by assuming that each MBH experiences two-phase accretion, with an initial\nphase of coherent-accretion via either the standard thin disc or\nsuper-Eddington disc, followed by a chaotic-accretion phase composed of many\nepisodes with different disc orientations. If the chaotic-phase is significant\nto the growth of an MBH, the MBH spin quickly reaches the maximum value because\nof the initial coherent-accretion, then changes to a quasi-equilibrium state\nand fluctuates around a value mainly determined by the mean ratio of the disc\nto the MBH mass ($M_{\\bullet}$) in the chaotic-accretion episodes, and further\ndeclines due to late chaotic-accretion if $M_\\bullet \\gtrsim (1-3) \\times 10^8\nM_\\odot$. The turning point to this decline is determined by the equality of\nthe disc warp radius and disc size. By matching the currently available spin\nmeasurements with mock samples generated from the two-phase model(s) on the\nspin-mass plane, we find that MBHs must experience significant\nchaotic-accretion phase with many episodes and the mass accreted in each\nepisode is roughly 1-2 percent of M_bh or less.

However, there is often\na small mismatch between the simulated tactile feelings and intended tactile\nfeelings by tactile designers. Thus, a method of modulating the vibrotactile\nperception is required. We focus on fine roughness perception and we propose a\nmethod using a pseudo-haptic effect to modulate fine roughness perception of\nvibrotactile texture. Specifically, we visually modify the pointer's position\non the screen slightly, which indicates the touch position on textured\nsurfaces. We hypothesized that if users receive vibrational feedback watching\nthe pointer visually oscillating back/forth and left/right, users would believe\nthe vibrotactile surfaces more uneven. We also hypothesized that as the size of\nvisual oscillation is getting larger, the amount of modification of roughness\nperception of vibrotactile surfaces would be larger. We conducted user studies\nto test the hypotheses.

It is shown\nthat for any (non-homogeneous) purely diffusing system, under any isotropic\nuniform incidence, the average length of trajectories through the system (the\naverage length of the random walk trajecto-ries from entry point to first exit\npoint) is independent of the characteristics of the diffusion process and\ntherefore depends only on the geometry of the system. This exact invariance\nproperty may be seen as a generalization to diffusion of the well known\nmean-chord-length property [1], leading to broad physics and biology\napplications. Let us first consider a practical animal-biology example that was\nat the origin of the theoretical work reported hereafter. It is well\nestablished, for diverse species, that the spontaneous displacement of insects\nsuch as ants, on an horizontal planar surface, may be accurately mod-eled as a\nconstant-speed diffusion random-walk [2-4]. We assume that a circle of radius R\nis drawn on the surface and we measure the average time that ants spend inside\nthe circle when they enter it (see Fig. 1). The last assumption is that\nmeasurements are performed a long time after ants were dropped on the surface,\nso that the memory of their initial position is lost : this is enough to ensure\nthat no specific direction is favored and therefore that when ants encounter\nthe circle, their incident directions are distributed isotropically. Simple\nMonte Carlo simulations of such experiments (see Fig. 2) indicate without any\ndoubt that the average encounter time (time between entry into the circle and\nfirst exit), for a fixed velocity, depends only of the circle radius. It is\nindependent of the characteristics of the diffusion walk : the mean free path\n$\\lambda$ (average distance between two scattering events, i.e. between two\ndirection-changes), and the single-scattering phase function p(u s , u i)\n(probability density function of the scattering direction u s for an incident\ndirection u i). Furthermore, this average time scales as R/v, which means that\nthe average trajectory-length < L > scales as R. The average trajectory-length\nwould therefore be the same for different experiments with any insect\nspecies-or for any type of diffusive corpuscular motion. There are two reasons\nwhy this observation may initially sound counter-intuitive. The first reason is\nthat the average length of diffusion trajectories between two points is known\nto scale approximately as d 2 /$\\lambda$ where d is the distance between the\ntwo points (1). For shorter mean (1)This scaling would be exact for an infinite\ndomain in the limit d >> $\\lambda$ [5] c EDP Sciences\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 14:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

This theoretical prediction has been\nconfirmed by identifying such morphologies in real galaxies. The nature and\norigin of this instability remains however poorly understood with some studies\nclaiming it to be due to fire-hose instability while others relating it to\nvertical instability of stellar orbits supporting the bar. One of the channels\nfor the formation of galactic bars is via the interaction of disky galaxies\nwith perturbers of significant mass. Tidally induced bars offer a unique\npossibility of studying buckling instability because their formation can be\ncontrolled by changing the strength of the interaction while keeping the\ninitial structure of the galaxy the same. We use a set of four simulations of\nflyby interactions where a galaxy on a prograde orbit forms a bar, which is\nstronger for stronger tidal forces. We study their buckling by calculating\ndifferent kinematic signatures, including profiles of the mean velocity in\nvertical direction, as well as distortions of the bars out of the disk plane.\nAlthough our two strongest bars buckle most strongly, there is no direct\nrelation between the ratio of vertical to horizontal velocity dispersion and\nthe bar's susceptibility to buckling, as required by the fire-hose instability\ninterpretation. While our weakest bar buckles, a stronger one does not, its\ndispersion ratio remains low and it grows to become the strongest of all at the\nend of evolution. Instead, we find that during buckling the resonance between\nthe vertical and radial orbital frequencies becomes wide and therefore able to\nmodify stellar orbits over a significant range of radii. We conclude that the\nvertical orbital instability is the more plausible explanation for the origin\nof buckling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 15:38:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 15:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

According to this scenario, noble gas elements such as Ar and Ne are\nnot expected to be depleted into dust, and therefore should not show any drop,\nbut follow the general increase of metal abundance toward the center. In this\nwork, we test this scenario by measuring with {\\sl Chandra} data the radial\nprofiles of Ar and Ne in a sample of 12 groups and clusters where a central\ndrop in Fe abundance has been detected. We confirm the presence of the Fe drop\nin 10 out of 12 clusters at more than 2$\\sigma$ c.l., and 4 Ar drops with\nsimilar significance. We also find 4 Ne drops, with the caveat that Ne\nabundance measurement from CCD spectra suffers from systematics not completely\nunder control.

We also check that Si and S profiles are\nmostly consistent with Fe.

The global convergence of the gradient projection\nmethod to the exact solution is proved for this functional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 21:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

The most common funding method, online advertising, is rife\nwith well-known performance and privacy harms, and an intractable subject-agent\nconflict: many users do not want to see advertisements, depriving the site of\nneeded funding.\n  Because of these negative aspects of advertisement-based funding, paywalls\nare an increasingly popular alternative for websites. This shift to a\n\"pay-for-access\" web is one that has potentially huge implications for the web\nand society. Instead of a system where information (nominally) flows freely,\npaywalls create a web where high quality information is available to fewer and\nfewer people, leaving the rest of the web users with less information, that\nmight be also less accurate and of lower quality. Despite the potential\nsignificance of a move from an \"advertising-but-open\" web to a \"paywalled\" web,\nwe find this issue understudied.\n  This work addresses this gap in our understanding by measuring how widely\npaywalls have been adopted, what kinds of sites use paywalls, and the\ndistribution of policies enforced by paywalls. A partial list of our findings\ninclude that (i) paywall use is accelerating (2x more paywalls every 6 months),\n(ii) paywall adoption differs by country (e.g. 18.75% in US, 12.69% in\nAustralia), (iii) paywalls change how users interact with sites (e.g. higher\nbounce rates, less incoming links), (iv) the median cost of an annual paywall\naccess is $108 per site, and (v) paywalls are in general trivial to circumvent.\n  Finally, we present the design of a novel, automated system for detecting\nwhether a site uses a paywall, through the combination of runtime browser\ninstrumentation and repeated programmatic interactions with the site. We intend\nthis classifier to augment future, longitudinal measurements of paywall use and\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 22:04:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 16:23:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 19:13:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 15:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-08"}

Firstly, the ability of sophisticated agent architectures with a\npurely physical implementation to support certain functional forms of qualia or\nproto-qualia appears to entail the possibility of machine consciousness with\nqualia, not only for reductive theories but also for the nonreductive ones that\nregard consciousness as ubiquitous in Nature. Secondly, analysis of\nintrospective psychological material seems to hint that, under the threshold of\nour ordinary waking awareness, there exist further 'submerged' or 'subliminal'\nlayers of consciousness which constitute a hidden foundation and support and\nanother source of our phenomenal intuitions. These 'submerged' layers might\nhelp explain certain puzzling phenomena concerning subliminal perception, such\nas the apparently 'unconscious' multisensory integration and learning of\nsubliminal stimuli.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 19:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-11"}

Among them, deep learning systems are one of the most important\nconsumer systems for GPU nowadays. As deep learning applications impose deeper\nand larger models in order to achieve higher accuracy, memory management\nbecomes an important research topic for deep learning systems, given that GPU\nhas limited memory size. Many approaches have been proposed towards this issue,\ne.g., model compression and memory swapping. However, they either degrade the\nmodel accuracy or require a lot of manual intervention. In this paper, we\npropose two orthogonal approaches to reduce the memory cost from the system\nperspective. Our approaches are transparent to the models, and thus do not\naffect the model accuracy. They are achieved by exploiting the iterative nature\nof the training algorithm of deep learning to derive the lifetime and\nread/write order of all variables. With the lifetime semantics, we are able to\nimplement a memory pool with minimal fragments. However, the optimization\nproblem is NP-complete. We propose a heuristic algorithm that reduces up to\n13.3% of memory compared with Nvidia's default memory pool with equal time\ncomplexity. With the read/write semantics, the variables that are not in use\ncan be swapped out from GPU to CPU to reduce the memory footprint. We propose\nmultiple swapping strategies to automatically decide which variable to swap and\nwhen to swap out (in), which reduces the memory cost by up to 34.2% without\ncommunication overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 08:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-18"}
