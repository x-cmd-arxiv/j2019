Alternatively, as an\neconomically effective solution, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\naugmented with the functionalities of terrestrial base stations (BSs), is\nrecently advocated. In this paper we investigate the effect that the\nincorporation of UAV-mounted BSs (U-BS) poses on the coverage probability of\ncellular networks. To this end, we focus on the evaluation of the coverage\nprobability of a large-scale aerialterrestrial heterogenous cellular network\n(AT-HetNet), in which BSs of each technology/tier can be either ground (G-BS)\nor UBS. Our analysis incorporates the impact of Line-of-Sight (LOS) and non-LOS\n(NLOS) path-loss attenuations of both ground-toground (G2G) and Air-to-Ground\n(A2G) links. Adopting tools of stochastic geometry we provide an expression for\nthe coverage probability based on main system parameters and percentage of BSs\nin each tier that are aerial. We confirm the accuracy of our analysis. Using\nour analysis, we observe that for several common communication environments,\ne.g., high-rise and dense urban environments, the inclusion of U-BSs can be\ndetrimental to the coverage probability. Nevertheless, it is still possible to\nminimize the coverage cost by turning off a percentage of G-BSs.

Here, we extend topological phases into dynamically\ndriven nonlinear systems and achieve a Floquet Chern insulator of light in\nnonlinear photonic crystals (PhCs). Specifically, we start by presenting the\nFloquet eigenvalue problem in driven two-dimensional PhCs and show it is\nnecessarily non-Hermitian. We then define topological invariants associated\nwith Floquet bands using non-Hermitian topological band theory, and show that\ntopological band gaps with non-zero Chern number can be opened by breaking\ntime-reversal symmetry through the driving field. Furthermore, we show that\ntopological phase transitions between Floquet Chern insulators and normal\ninsulators occur at synthetic Weyl points in a three-dimensional parameter\nspace consisting of two momenta and the driving frequency. Finally, we\nnumerically demonstrate the existence of chiral edge states at the interfaces\nbetween a Floquet Chern insulator and normal insulators, where the transport is\nnon-reciprocal and uni-directional. Our work paves the way to further exploring\ntopological phases in driven nonlinear optical systems and their optoelectronic\napplications, and our method of inducing Floquet topological phases is also\napplicable to other wave systems, such as phonons, excitons, and polaritons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 17:05:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 03:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

The\nnetworks are trained on a dataset of thermal simulations of the emitted\ninfrared flux for different values of surface rock abundance, roughness, and\nvalues of the thermal inertia of the regolith and of the rock components. These\nsurrogate models are then employed to retrieve the surface thermal properties\nby Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian inversion of observed infrared fluxes. We\napply the method to the inversion of simulated infrared fluxes of asteroid\n(101195) Bennu -- according to a geometry of observations similar to those\nplanned for NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission -- and infrared observations of asteroid\n(25143) Itokawa. In both cases, the surface properties of the asteroid -- such\nas surface roughness, thermal inertia of the regolith and rock component, and\nrelative rock abundance -- are retrieved; the contribution from the regolith\nand rock components are well separated. For the case of Itokawa, we retrieve a\nrock abundance of about 85% for pebbles larger than the diurnal skin depth,\nwhich is about 2 cm. The thermal inertia of the rock is found to be lower than\nthe expected value for LL chondrites, indicating that the rocks on Itokawa\ncould be fractured. The average thermal inertia of the surface is around 750 $J\ns^{-1/2} K^{-1} m^{-2}$ and the measurement of thermal inertia of the regolith\ncorresponds to an average regolith particle diameter of about 10 mm,\nconsistently with in situ measurements as well as results from previous\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 19:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-26"}

The observed dark matter abundance is generated\nautomatically by oscillations of the relaxion field that begin once it is\nmisaligned from its original stopping point after reheating.

An open question\nfor GW170817 remains the values and impact of the initial NS spins. The initial\nspins could possibly affect the remnant black hole (BH) mass and spin, the\nremnant disk and the formation and lifetime of a jet and its luminosity. Here\nwe summarize our general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of\nspinning, NS binaries undergoing merger and delayed collapse to a BH. The\nbinaries consist of two identical NSs, modeled as $\\Gamma=2$ polytropes, in\nquasicircular orbit, each with spins $\\chi_{\\rm{NS}}=-0.053,\\,0,\\,0.24$, or\n$0.36$. The stars are endowed initially with a dipolar magnetic field extending\nfrom the interior into the exterior, as in a radio pulsar. Following merger,\nthe redistribution of angular momentum by magnetic braking and magnetic\nturbulent viscosity in the hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnant, along with\nthe loss of angular momentum due to gravitational radiation, induce the\nformation of a massive, nearly uniformly rotating inner core surrounded by a\nmagnetized Keplerian disk-like envelope. The HMNS eventually collapses to a BH,\nwith spin $a/M_{\\rm BH} \\simeq 0.78$ independent of the initial spin of the\nNSs, surrounded by a magnetized accretion disk.

It has been proposed that super-Earths are\nscaled-up terrestrial planets that formed similarly, through mutual accretion\nof planetary embryos, but in discs much denser than the solar protoplanetary\ndisc. We argue instead that terrestrial planets and super-Earths have two\ndistinct formation pathways that are regulated by the disc's pebble reservoir.\nThrough numerical integrations, which combine pebble accretion and N-body\ngravity between embryos, we show that a difference of a factor of two in the\npebble mass-flux is enough to change the evolution from the terrestrial to the\nsuper-Earth growth mode. If the pebble mass-flux is small, then the initial\nembryos within the ice line grow slowly and do not migrate substantially,\nresulting in a widely spaced population of Mars-mass embryos when the gas disc\ndissipates. Without gas being present, the embryos become unstable and a small\nnumber of terrestrial planets are formed by mutual collisions. The final\nterrestrial planets are at most 5 Earth masses. Instead, if the pebble\nmass-flux is high, then the initial embryos within the ice line rapidly become\nsufficiently massive to migrate through the gas disc. Embryos concentrate at\nthe inner edge of the disc and growth accelerates through mutual merging. This\nleads to the formation of a system of closely spaced super-Earths in the 5 to\n20 Earth-mass range, bounded by the pebble isolation mass. Generally,\ninstabilities of these super-Earth systems after the disappearance of the gas\ndisc trigger additional merging events and dislodge the system from resonant\nchains. The pebble flux - which controls the transition between the two growth\nmodes - may be regulated by the initial reservoir of solids in the disc or the\npresence of more distant giant planets that can halt the radial flow of\npebbles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 22:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

Mechanotransduction provides\nthe link between modulation of the extracellular matrix and intracellular\nactions. By controlling the balance between the intracellular and extracellular\ndomains, the mechanotransduction process determines optimal functionality of\nthe skeletal dynamics, and it is one of the possible causes of\nosteophatological diseases.\n  Results: Mechanotransduction in a single osteoblast under external mechanical\nperturbations has been modelled in the agent based framework to reproduce the\ndynamics of the stochastic reaction diffusion process among molecules in the\ncytoplasm, nuclear and extracellular domains. The amount of molecules and\nfluctuations of each molecular class has been analysed in terms of recurrences\nof critical events. A numerical approach has been developed to invert\nsubordination processes and to extract the directing processes from the\nmolecular signals in order to derive the distribution of recurrence of events.\n  Conclusions: We observed large fluctuations enclose information hidden in the\nnoise which is beyond the dynamic variations of molecular baselines.

A natural\nquestion to ask is whether the $f(k)$ appearing in the running time of the\nbest-known algorithms is optimal for any of these problems.\n  In this paper, we examine parameterized problems where $f(k)$ is\n$k^{O(k)}=2^{O(k\\log k)}$ in the best known running time and for a number of\nsuch problems, we show that the dependence on $k$ in the running time cannot be\nimproved to single exponential.

The latter can be achieved by minimizing the maximum discrepancy of\npredictors (classifiers).

To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework for the\nanalysis of microbiome count data for differential abundance analysis. Under\nthis framework, we introduce a bi-level Bayesian hierarchical model that allows\na flexible choice of the count generating process, and hyperpriors in the\nfeature selection scheme. We particularly focus on employing a zero-inflated\nnegative binomial model with a Bayesian nonparametric prior model on the bottom\nlevel, and applying Gaussian mixture models for differentially abundant taxa\ndetection on the top level. Our method allows for the simultaneous modeling of\nsample heterogeneity and detecting differentially abundant taxa. We conducted\ncomprehensive simulations and summarized the improved statistical performances\nof the proposed model. We applied the model in two real microbiome study\ndatasets and successfully identified biologically validated differentially\nabundant taxa. We hope that the proposed framework and model can facilitate\nfurther microbiome studies and elucidate disease etiology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Feb 2019 06:04:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2019 22:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

The\nmethod was used to extract Google Scholar citation counts for 77,884 American\ndoctoral dissertations from 2013-2017 via ProQuest, with a precision of over\n95%. Some ProQuest dissertations that were dual indexed with other repositories\ncould not be retrieved with ProQuest-specific searches but could be found with\nGoogle Scholar searches of the other repositories.

We\ninvestigate how the formation of planetary systems depends on the radial flux\nof pebbles through the protoplanetary disc and on the planet migration rate.\nOur N-body simulations confirm previous findings that Jupiter-like planets in\norbits outside the water ice line originate from embryos starting out at 20-40\nAU when using nominal type-I and type-II migration rates and a pebble flux of\n100-200 Earth masses per million years, enough to grow Jupiter within the\nlifetime of the solar nebula. The planetary embryos placed up to 30AU migrate\ninto the inner system (r<1AU) and form super-Earths or hot and warm gas giants,\nproducing systems that are inconsistent with the configuration of the solar\nsystem, but consistent with some exoplanetary systems. We also explore slower\nmigration rates which allow the formation of gas giants from embryos\noriginating from the 5-10AU region, which are stranded exterior to 1 AU at the\nend of the gas-disc phase. We identify a pebble flux threshold below which\nmigration dominates and moves the planetary core to the inner disc, where the\npebble isolation mass is too low for the planet to accrete gas efficiently.\nGiant planet growth requires a sufficiently-high pebble flux to enable growth\nto out-compete migration. Even higher pebble fluxes produce systems with\nmultiple gas giants. We show that planetary embryos starting interior to 5AU do\nnot grow into gas giants, even if migration is slow and the pebble flux is\nlarge. Instead they grow to the mass regime of super-Earths. This stunted\ngrowth is caused by the low pebble isolation mass in the inner disc and is\nindependent of the pebble flux.

To achieve high prediction accuracy on neural signals,\nvisual encoding models should include precise visual features and appropriate\nprediction algorithms. Most existing visual encoding models employ hand-craft\nvisual features (e.g., Gabor wavelets or semantic labels) or data-driven\nfeatures (e.g., features extracted from deep neural networks (DNN)). They also\nassume a linear mapping between feature representation to brain activity.\nHowever, it remains unknown whether such linear mapping is sufficient for\nmaximizing prediction accuracy. New Method: We construct a new visual encoding\nframework to predict cortical responses in a benchmark functional magnetic\nresonance imaging (fMRI) dataset. In this framework, we employ the transfer\nlearning technique to incorporate a pre-trained DNN (i.e., AlexNet) and train a\nnonlinear mapping from visual features to brain activity. This nonlinear\nmapping replaces the conventional linear mapping and is supposed to improve\nprediction accuracy on brain activity. Results: The proposed framework can\nsignificantly predict responses of over 20% voxels in early visual areas (i.e.,\nV1-lateral occipital region, LO) and achieve unprecedented prediction accuracy.\nComparison with Existing Methods: Comparing to two conventional visual encoding\nmodels, we find that the proposed encoding model shows consistent higher\nprediction accuracy in all early visual areas, especially in relatively\nanterior visual areas (i.e., V4 and LO). Conclusions: Our work proposes a new\nframework to utilize pre-trained visual features and train non-linear mappings\nfrom visual features to brain activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Feb 2019 14:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-26"}

To\nunderstand of the RVM, we first discuss the fitness voter model (FVM), in which\neach voter has a fixed and distinct fitness. In a voting event where voter $i$\nis fitter than voter $j$, only $j$ changes opinion. We show that the dynamics\nof the FVM and the voter model are identical. We next discuss the adaptive\nvoter model (AVM), in which the influencing voter in a voting event increases\nits fitness by a fixed amount. The dynamics of the AVM is non-stationary and\nslowly crosses over to that of FVM because of the gradual broadening of the\nfitness distribution of the population. Finally, we treat the RVM, in which the\nvoter $i$ is endowed with a reputational rank $r_i$ that ranges from 1 (highest\nrank) to $N$ (lowest), where $N$ is the population size. In a voting event in\nwhich voter $i$ outranks $j$, only the opinion of $j$ changes. Concomitantly,\nthe rank of $i$ increases, while that of $j$ does not change. The rank\ndistribution remains uniform on the integers $1,2,3,\\ldots,N$, leading to\nstationary dynamics. For equal number of voters in the two voting states with\nthese two subpopulations having the same average rand, the time to reach\nconsensus in the mean-field limit scales as $\\exp(\\sqrt{N})$.

On the other hand, the\napplication of model-free approaches such as those based on artificial neural\nnetworks approaches is currently growing rapidly in the area of power\nelectronics and drives. This paper presents a new control scheme for a\ntwo-level converter based on combining MPC and feed-forward ANN, with the aim\nof getting lower THD and improving the steady and dynamic performance of the\nsystem for different types of loads. First, MPC is used, as an expert, in the\ntraining phase to generate data required for training the proposed neural\nnetwork. Then, once the neural network is fine-tuned, it can be successfully\nused online for voltage tracking purpose, without the need of using MPC. The\nproposed ANN-based control strategy is validated through simulation, using\nMATLAB/Simulink tools, taking into account different loads conditions.\nMoreover, the performance of the ANN-based controller is evaluated, on several\nsamples of linear and non-linear loads under various operating conditions, and\ncompared to that of MPC, demonstrating the excellent steady-state and dynamic\nperformance of the proposed ANN-based control strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 21:51:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 May 2019 10:41:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 20:43:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-24"}

In our\nmethod, a FOFE-based FFNN is used to train a pseudo language model over\nunlabelled corpus, then the pre-trained language model is capable of\nabstracting the surrounding context of polyseme instances in labelled corpus\ninto context embeddings. Next, we take advantage of these context embeddings\ntowards WSD classification. We conducted experiments on several WSD data sets,\nwhich demonstrates that our proposed method can achieve comparable performance\nto that of the state-of-the-art approach at the expense of much lower\ncomputational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Feb 2019 00:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-28"}

In this work, we investigated the\nelectrostatic deposition of the negatively charged [H7P8W48O184]33- POM onto\npositively charged 8-amino-1-octanethiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)\npreformed onto gold substrates or onto an array of gold nanodots. The\nring-shaped [H7P8W48O184]33- POM was selected as an example of large POMs with\nhigh charge storage capacity. To avoid the formation of POM aggregates onto the\nsubstrates, which would introduce variability in the local electrical\nproperties, special attention has to be paid to the preformed SAM seeding\nlayer, which should itself be deprived of aggregates. Where necessary, rinsing\nsteps were found to be crucial to eliminate these aggregates and to provide\nuniformly covered substrates for subsequent POM deposition and electrical\ncharacterizations. This especially holds for commercially available gold/glass\nsubstrates while these rinsing steps were not essential in the case of template\nstripped gold of very low roughness. Charge transport through the related\nmolecular junctions and nanodot molecule junctions (NMJs) has been probed by\nconducting-AFM. We analyzed the current-voltage curves with different models:\nelectron tunneling though the SAMs (Simmons model), transition voltage\nspectroscopy (TVS) method or molecular single energy level mediated transport\n(Landauer equation) and we discussed the energetics of the molecular junctions.\nWe concluded to an energy level alignment of the alkyl spacer and POM lowest\noccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs), probably due to dipolar effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 21:24:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

Many works target the development of more effective\nnetworks, which results in a complexification of their architectures with more\nlayers, multiple sub-networks, or even the combination of multiple classifiers,\nbut this often comes at the expense of producing uninterpretable black boxes.\nIn this paper, we redesign a simple capsule network to enable it to synthesize\nclass-representative samples, called prototypes, by replacing the last layer\nwith a novel Hit-or-Miss layer. This layer contains activated vectors, called\ncapsules, that we train to hit or miss a fixed target capsule by tailoring a\nspecific centripetal loss function. This possibility allows to develop a data\naugmentation step combining information from the data space and the feature\nspace, resulting in a hybrid data augmentation process. We show that our\nnetwork, named HitNet, is able to reach better performances than those\nreproduced with the initial CapsNet on several datasets, while allowing to\nvisualize the nature of the features extracted as deformations of the\nprototypes, which provides a direct insight into the feature representation\nlearned by the network .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Feb 2019 01:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-14"}
