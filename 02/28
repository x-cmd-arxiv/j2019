However, synthesising such controllers, even for a single objective,\nis a demanding process. In this paper, we present a novel and straightforward\napproach to synthesising these policies through a combination of trajectory\noptimisation, homotopy continuation, and imitation learning. We use numerical\ncontinuation to efficiently generate optimal demonstrations across several\nobjectives and boundary conditions, and use these to train our policies.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate the ability of our policies to effectively learn\nfamilies of optimal state-feedback controllers, which can be used to change\nobjective functions online. We illustrate this approach across two trajectory\noptimisation problems, an inverted pendulum swingup and a spacecraft orbit\ntransfer, and show that the synthesised policies, when evaluated in simulation,\nproduce trajectories that are near-optimal. These results indicate the benefit\nof trajectory optimisation and homotopy continuation to the synthesis of\ncontrollers in dynamic-objective contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 17:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 11:13:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 08:19:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

Alternatively, Parker-type\nnanoflare models of the solar corona hypothesize that a braiding mechanism\noperates between unresolved loop strands, which is a more complex topological\nmodel. In this study we use the vertical-current approximation of a\nnonpotential magnetic field solution (that fulfills the divergence-free and\nforce-free conditions) to characterize the number of helical turns $N_{twist}$\nin twisted coronal loops. We measure the helical twist in 15 active regions\nobserved with AIA and HMI/SDO and find a mean nonpotentiality angle (between\nthe potential and nonpotential field directions) of $\\mu_{NP} = 15^\\circ \\pm\n3^\\circ$.

The number of twist turns $N_{twist}$\ncorresponds to the Gauss linkage number $N_{link}$ in braiding topologies.

Parker-type nanoflaring can thus occur in non-forcefree environments\nonly, such as in the chromosphere and transition region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 16:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

We\nprove here that, whatever this algorithm, a peeling process always reveals\nabout the same portion of the map, thus growing roughly metric balls. Applied\nto well-designed algorithms, this easily enables us to compare distances in the\nmap and in its dual, as well as to control the so-called pioneer points of the\nsimple random walk, both on the map and on its dual.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 16:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

Here, an\nempirical phenomenology based on all available literature data for planar Cu in\nhole-doped cuprates is developed. It is found that most of the seemingly\ndifferent relaxation rates among the systems are due to a temperature\nindependent anisotropy that affects the mostly measured $1/T_{1\\parallel}$, the\nrate with an external magnetic field along the crystal $c$-axis, while\n$1/T_{1\\perp}$ is largely independent on doping and material above the critical\ntemperature of superconductivity ($T_c$). This includes very strongly overdoped\nsystems that show Fermi liquid behavior and obey the Korringa law. Below $T_c$\nthe relaxation rates are similar, as well, if plotted against the reduced\ntemperature $T/T_c$. Thus, planar Cu nuclear relaxation is governed by a\nsimple, dominant mechanism that couples the nuclei with varying anisotropy to a\nrather ubiquitous bath of electronic excitations that appear Fermi liquid-like\nirrespective of doping and family. In particular, there is no significant\nenhancement of the relaxation due to electronic spin fluctuations, different\nfrom earlier conclusions. Only the La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ family appears to be\nan outlier as additional relaxation is present, however, the anisotropy remains\ntemperature independent. Also systems with very low doping levels, for which\nthere is a lack of data, may behave differently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 16:35:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2019 18:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

While these\nmodels are compact, they typically operate by repeated application of a small\nweight matrix to all the frames in a video. E.g. recurrent neural network based\nmethods compute a hidden state for every frame of the video using a recurrent\nweight matrix. Similarly, cluster-and-aggregate based methods such as NetVLAD,\nhave a learnable clustering matrix which is used to assign soft-clusters to\nevery frame in the video. Since these models look at every frame in the video,\nthe number of floating point operations (FLOPs) is still large even though the\nmemory footprint is small. We focus on building compute-efficient video\nclassification models which process fewer frames and hence have less number of\nFLOPs. Similar to memory efficient models, we use the idea of distillation\nalbeit in a different setting. Specifically, in our case, a compute-heavy\nteacher which looks at all the frames in the video is used to train a\ncompute-efficient student which looks at only a small fraction of frames in the\nvideo. This is in contrast to a typical memory efficient Teacher-Student\nsetting, wherein both the teacher and the student look at all the frames in the\nvideo but the student has fewer parameters. Our work thus complements the\nresearch on memory efficient video classification. We do an extensive\nevaluation with three types of models for video classification,viz.(i)\nrecurrent models (ii) cluster-and-aggregate models and (iii) memory-efficient\ncluster-and-aggregate models and show that in each of these cases, a see-it-all\nteacher can be used to train a compute efficient see-very-little student. We\nshow that the proposed student network can reduce the inference time by 30% and\nthe number of FLOPs by approximately 90% with a negligible drop in the\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 17:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-28"}

Inference\nunder this model is challenging, but we address this by introducing an\nattribution prior extracted from a neural end-to-end visuomotor control model.\nGiven the sequence of controllers comprising a task, we simplify the trace\nusing grammar parsing strategies, taking advantage of the sequence\ncompositionality, before grounding the controllers by training perception\nnetworks to predict goals given images. Using this approach, we are\nsuccessfully able to induce a program for a visuomotor reaching task involving\nloops and conditionals from a single demonstration and a neural end-to-end\nmodel. In addition, we are able to discover the program used for a tower\nbuilding task. We argue that computer program-like control systems are more\ninterpretable than alternative end-to-end learning approaches, and that hybrid\nsystems inherently allow for better generalisation across task configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 17:43:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 10:04:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-12"}

However, there is no a priori assurance\nthat these approximate solutions are accurate; their accuracy depends on the\nability of the low-dimensional trial basis to represent the FOM solution. As a\nresult, ROMs can generate inaccurate approximate solutions, e.g., when the FOM\nsolution at the online prediction point is not well represented by training\ndata used to construct the trial basis. To address this fundamental deficiency\nof standard model-reduction approaches, this work proposes a novel\nonline-adaptive mechanism for efficiently enriching the trial basis in a manner\nthat ensures convergence of the ROM to the FOM, yet does not incur any FOM\nsolves. The mechanism is based on the previously proposed adaptive\n$h$-refinement method for ROMs [12], but improves upon this work in two crucial\nways. First, the proposed method enables basis refinement with respect to any\northogonal basis (not just the Kronecker basis), thereby generalizing the\nrefinement mechanism and enabling it to be tailored to the physics\ncharacterizing the problem at hand. Second, the proposed method provides a fast\nonline algorithm for periodically compressing the enriched basis via an\nefficient proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method, which does not incur\nany operations that scale with the FOM dimension. These two features allow the\nproposed method to serve as (1) a failsafe mechanism for ROMs, as the method\nenables the ROM to satisfy any prescribed error tolerance online (even in the\ncase of inadequate training), and (2) an efficient online basis-adaptation\nmechanism, as the combination of basis enrichment and compression enables the\nbasis to adapt online while controlling its dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 17:47:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 22:14:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

To what\nextent these algorithms may approximate a Bayesian solution is a problem of\ninterest, not always solved. On this background, in this paper we revisit a\nsequential procedure proposed by Smith and Makov (1978) for unsupervised\nlearning and classification in finite mixtures, and developed by M. Newton and\nZhang (1999), for nonparametric mixtures. Newton's algorithm is simple and\nfast, and theoretically intriguing.

We can then prove that it is,\nasymptotically, a Bayesian, exchangeable mixture model. Moreover, while the\nalgorithm only offers a point estimate, our approach allows us to obtain an\nasymptotic posterior distribution and asymptotic credible intervals for the\nmixing distribution. Our results also provide practical hints for tuning the\nalgorithm and obtaining desirable properties, as we illustrate in a simulation\nstudy.

Two estimation schemes are considered, one for each class of risk\nmeasures. One estimation scheme involves applying the risk measure to the\nempirical distribution function formed from a collection of i.i.d. samples of\nthe random variable (r.v.), while the second scheme involves applying the same\nprocedure to a truncated sample. The bounds provided apply to three popular\nclasses of distributions, namely sub-Gaussian, sub-exponential and heavy-tailed\ndistributions.

Many dynamical phenomena, such as\ncore-collapse supernovae, the formation and cooling of proto-neutron stars, and\nneutron star mergers, lie between these two regimes and depend on the EOS at\nfinite temperatures for matter with varying proton fractions. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new framework to accurately calculate the thermal pressure of\nneutron-proton-electron matter at arbitrary density, temperature, and proton\nfraction. This framework can be expressed using a set of five\nphysically-motivated parameters that span a narrow range of values for\nrealistic EOS and are able to capture the leading-order effects of degenerate\nmatter on the thermal pressure. We base two of these parameters on a new\napproximation of the Dirac effective mass, with which we reproduce the thermal\npressure to within <~30% for a variety of realistic EOS at densities of\ninterest. Three additional parameters, based on the behavior of the symmetry\nenergy near the nuclear saturation density, allow for the extrapolation of any\ncold EOS in beta-equilibrium to arbitrary proton fractions. Our model thus\nallows a user to extend any cold nucleonic EOS, including piecewise-polytropes,\nto arbitrary temperature and proton fraction, for use in calculations and\nnumerical simulations of astrophysical phenomena.

We review twenty previously devised\nsolutions to the SUSY mu problem and re-evaluate them in light of whether they\nare apt to support the LH. We organize the twenty solutions according to: 1.\nsolutions from supergravity/superstring constructions, 2. extended MSSM\nsolutions, 3. solutions from an extra local U(1)' and 4. solutions involving\nPeccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry and axions. Early solutions would invoke a global\nPeccei-Quinn symmetry to forbid the mu term while relating the mu solution to\nsolving the strong CP problem via the axion. We discuss the gravity-safety\nissue pertaining to global symmetries and the movement instead toward local\ngauge symmetries or R-symmetries, either continuous or discrete. At present,\ndiscrete R-symmetries of order M (Z_M^R) which emerge as remnants of Lorentz\nsymmetry of compact dimensions seem favored. Even so, a wide variety of\nregenerative mechanisms are possible, some of which relate to other issues such\nas the strong CP problem or the generation of neutrino masses. We also discuss\nthe issue of experimental verification or falsifiability of various solutions\nto the mu problem. Almost all solutions seem able to accommodate the LH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 19:35:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

Synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering measurements on individual\nfibres are used to determine the initial ODF and its evolution during in-situ\ntensile testing. This enables prediction of tensile modulus, strength and\nfracture envelope, with remarkable agreement with experimental data for fibres\nproduced in-house with different constituent CNTs and for different draw\nratios, as well as with literature data. The parameters extracted from the\nmodel include: CNT bundle shear strength, shear modulus and tensile strength.\nThese are in agreement with data for commercial high-performance fibres,\nalthough high compared with values for single-crystal graphite and short\nindividual CNTs. The manuscript also discusses the unusually high fracture\nenergy of CNT fibres and exceptionally high figure of merit for ballistic\nprotection. The model predicts that small improvements in orientation would\nlead to superior ballistic peformance than any synthetic high-peformance fiber,\nwith values of strain wave velocity ($U^{1/3}$) exceeding $1000 m/s$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 21:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-01"}

In this paper we show\nthat a unitary chosen uniformly at random from an approximate $n^{2/3}$-design\ngives rise to a quantum channel with superadditive classical Holevo capacity,\nwhere $n$ is the dimension of the unitary exhibiting the Stinespring dilation\nof the channel superoperator.\n  We prove a sharp Dvoretzky-like theorem (similar to Aubrun, Szarek, Werner,\n2010) stating that, with high probability under the choice of a unitary from an\napproximate $t$-design, random subspaces of large dimension make a Lipschitz\nfunction take almost constant value. Such theorems were known earlier only for\nHaar random unitaries.

An instance of\nthe Correlation Clustering problem consists of a graph $G$ (not necessarily\ncomplete) whose edges are labeled by a binary classifier as ``similar'' and\n``dissimilar''. An objective which has received a lot of attention in\nliterature is that of minimizing the number of disagreements: an edge is in\ndisagreement if it is a ``similar'' edge and is present across clusters or if\nit is a ``dissimilar'' edge and is present within a cluster. Define the\ndisagreements vector to be an $n$ dimensional vector indexed by the vertices,\nwhere the $v$-th index is the number of disagreements at vertex $v$.

The minimum of activity is observed in\n2014, when the broad lines almost disappeared. We confirm that NGC 3516 is a\nchanging-look AGN, and the absorption seen in the UV and X-ray may indicate\nthat there is an obscuring region which is responsible for this.\n  The line profiles are also changing. The mean profiles of the broad Halpha\nand Hbeta lines show shoulder-like structure in the wings, and enhanced peak,\nthat may indicate a complex BLR.

A prominent upshot of\nthese interference phenomena is the resonant suppression of the reflection\namplitude, which leads to the observation of multiple Fano minima in the\nreflection spectrum. Such minima determine the points at which transparency is\ninduced in the system. By taking recourse to the real-space Hamiltonian\nframework, we calculate analytically the reflectivity and transmissivity for a\none-dimensional waveguide that evanescently couples to a chain of equally\nspaced quantum emitters. The inter-emitter spacing relative to the wavelength\nof the propagating photon, leading to a waveguide-mediated \"phase-coupling\"\nbetween the atoms, is found to fundamentally affect the existence of Fano\nminima. For a chain of $N$ atoms, the number of minima can be at most $N-1$.\nHowever, suitable choices of the phase can suppress the discernibility of the\nfull range of roots in the reflection spectrum. A principal observation for the\ncase of multiple emitters is the emergence of super-Gaussian characteristics\nclose to zero-detuning and consequently, a plateau-shaped broadband spectrum in\nthe region of high reflectivity.

Broadly, if a system $\\dot{x} = f(x,u)$ is locally\nasymptotically stabilizable, we are guaranteed a feedback controller $u(x)$\nthat forces convergence to an equilibrium for trajectories initialized\nsufficiently close to it. A necessary condition was given by Brockett: such\ncontrollers exist only when $f$ is open at the equilibrium. Recently, Gupta,\nJafari, Kipka and Mordukhovich considered a modification to this condition,\nreplacing Brockett's topological openness by the linear openness property of\nmodern variational analysis. In this paper, we show that under the linear\nopenness assumption there is a local diffeomorphism of neighborhoods of the\nequilibirum on which the system is exponentially stabilizable by means of\ncontinuous stationary feedback laws. Introducing a transversality property and\nrelating it to the above diffeomorphism, we prove that linear openness and\ntransversality on a punctured neighborhood of an equilibrium is sufficient for\nlocal exponential stabilizability of systems with a rank deficient\nlinearization.The main result goes beyond the usual Kalman and Hautus criteria\nfor the existence of exponential stabilizing feedback laws, since it allows us\nto handle systems for which exponential stabilization is achieved through\nhigher-order terms. However, it is implemented so far under a rather\nrestrictive row-rank conditions. This suggests a twofold approach to the use of\nthese properties: a point-wise version is enough to ensure stability via the\nlinearization, while a local version is enough to overcome deficiencies in the\nlinearization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 02:50:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 20:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-19"}

To combat this problem, several automated techniques\nhave been proposed to debloat software. A key metric used in many of these\nworks to demonstrate improved security is code reuse gadget count reduction.\nThe use of this metric is based on the prevailing idea that reducing the number\nof gadgets available in a software package reduces its attack surface and makes\nmounting a gadget-based code reuse exploit such as return-oriented programming\n(ROP) more difficult for an attacker. In this paper, we challenge this idea and\nshow through a variety of realistic debloating scenarios the flaws inherent to\nthe gadget count reduction metric. Specifically, we demonstrate that software\ndebloating can achieve high gadget count reduction rates, yet fail to limit an\nattacker's ability to construct an exploit.

Cognitive radio is a promising technology that allows the unlicensed\nusers, known as secondary users (SUs) to access licensed bands without making\ninterference to licensed users or primary users (PUs). As cloud computing has\nbecome popular in recent years, cognitive radio networks (CRNs) can be\nintegrated with the cloud platform. One of the important issues in CRNs is\nsecurity. It becomes a problem since CRNs use radio frequencies as a medium for\ntransmitting and CRNs share the same issues with wireless communication\nsystems. Another critical issue in CRNs is performance.

LOCO codes are easy to balance, and their inherent symmetry\nminimizes the rate loss with respect to unbalanced codes having the same\nconstraints. Furthermore, LOCO codes that forbid certain patterns can be used\nto alleviate inter-symbol interference in MR systems and inter-cell\ninterference in Flash systems. Numerical results demonstrate a gain of up to\n10% in rate achieved by LOCO codes with respect to other practical constrained\ncodes, including run-length-limited codes, designed for the same purpose.\nSimulation results suggest that it is possible to achieve a channel density\ngain of about 20% in MR systems by using a LOCO code to encode only the parity\nbits, limiting the rate loss, of a low-density parity-check code before\nwriting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 05:22:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 19:44:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 21:54:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 05:26:09 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 15:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

Its effectiveness is well established when the\ncovariates exhibit low-rank structure. However, its ability to handle settings\nwith noisy, missing, and mixed-valued, i.e., discrete and continuous,\ncovariates is not understood and remains an important open challenge. As the\nmain contribution of this work we establish the robustness of PCR, without any\nchange, in this respect and provide meaningful finite-sample analysis. To do\nso, we establish that PCR is equivalent to performing linear regression after\npre-processing the covariate matrix via hard singular value thresholding\n(HSVT). As a result, in the context of counterfactual analysis using\nobservational data, we show PCR is equivalent to the recently proposed robust\nvariant of the synthetic control method, known as robust synthetic control\n(RSC). As an immediate consequence, we obtain finite-sample analysis of the RSC\nestimator that was previously absent. As an important contribution to the\nsynthetic controls literature, we establish that an (approximate) linear\nsynthetic control exists in the setting of a generalized factor model or latent\nvariable model; traditionally in the literature, the existence of a synthetic\ncontrol needs to be assumed to exist as an axiom. We further discuss a\nsurprising implication of the robustness property of PCR with respect to noise,\ni.e., PCR can learn a good predictive model even if the covariates are\ntactfully transformed to preserve differential privacy.

The network where popular videos\nencoded by scalable video coding are already stored in randomly distributed\ncaching nodes is considered under adaptive video streaming concepts, and\ndistance-based interference management is investigated in this paper. In this\nnetwork model, a streaming user makes delay-constrained decisions depending on\nstochastic network states: 1) caching node for video delivery, 2) video\nquality, and 3) the quantity of video chunks to receive. Since wireless link\nactivation for video delivery may introduce delays, different timescales for\nupdating caching node association, video quality adaptation, and chunk amounts\nare considered. After associating with a caching node for video delivery, the\nstreaming user chooses combinations of quality and chunk amounts in the small\ntimescale. The dynamic decision making process for video quality and chunk\namounts at each slot is modeled using Markov decision process, and the caching\nnode decision is made based on the framework of Lyapunov optimization. Our\nintensive simulations verify that the proposed video delivery algorithm works\nreliably and also can control the tradeoff between video quality and playback\nlatency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 07:23:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-01"}

AGB stars go through a process of strong mass-loss that involves\npulsations of the atmosphere, which extends to a region where the conditions\nare adequate for dust grains to form.

To study the role of the SiO molecule in the process of dust formation\nand mass-loss in M-type AGB stars.\n  Methods. Using the IRAM NOEMA interferometer we observed the $^{28}$SiO and\n$^{29}$SiO $J=3-2$, $v=0$ emission from the inner circumstellar envelope of the\nevolved stars IK Tau and IRC+10011. We computed azimuthally averaged emission\nprofiles to compare the observations to models using a molecular excitation and\nray-tracing code for SiO thermal emission.\n  Results. We observed circular symmetry in the emission distribution. We also\nfound that the source diameter varies only marginally with radial velocity,\nwhich is not the expected behavior for envelopes expanding at an almost\nconstant velocity. The adopted density, velocity, and abundance laws, together\nwith the mass-loss rate, which best fit the observations, give us information\non the chemical behavior of the SiO molecule and its role in the dust formation\nprocess.\n  Conclusions. The results indicate that there is a strong coupling between the\ndepletion of gas phase SiO and gas acceleration in the inner envelope.

We built a comprehensive\ndataset of Central European temperate forest structure and multi-taxonomic\ndiversity (beetles, birds, bryophytes, fungi, lichens, and plants) across 352\nplots.

First, by comparing the\nsolar wind velocity (V) and the brightness temperature (T_b) in the polar\nregion, we found good correlation coefficients (CCs) between V and T_b in the\npolar regions, CC = 0.91 (0.83) for the northern (southern) polar region, and\nwe obtained the V-T_b relationship as V =12.6 (T_b-10,667)^{1/2}+432. We also\nconfirmed that the CC of V-T_b is higher than those of V-B and V-B/f, where B\nand f are the polar magnetic field strength and magnetic flux expansion rate,\nrespectively. These results indicate that T_b is a more direct parameter than B\nor B/f for expressing solar wind velocity. Next, we analyzed the long-term\nvariation of the polar brightening and its relation to the area of the polar\ncoronal hole (A). As a result, we found that the polar brightening matches the\nprobability distribution of the predicted coronal hole and that the CC between\nT_b and A is remarkably high, CC = 0.97.

The benchmark open cluster M67 is known to have solar metallicity\nand similar age as the Sun. It thus provides us a great opportunity to study\nthe properties of solar twins, as well as the evolution of Sun-like stars.\nAims. Previous spectroscopic studies reported to detect possible subtle changes\nin stellar surface abundances throughout the stellar evolutionary phase, namely\nthe effect of atomic diffusion, in M67. In this study we attempt to confirm and\nquantify more precisely the effect of atomic diffusion, as well as to explore\nthe level of chemical (in)homogeneity in M67. Methods. We presented a strictly\nline-by-line differential chemical abundance analysis of two groups of stars in\nM67: three turn-off stars and three sub-giants. Stellar atmospheric parameters\nand elemental abundances were obtained with very high precision using the\nKeck/HIRES spectra. Results. The sub-giants in our sample show negligible\nabundance variations ($\\le$ 0.02 dex), which implies that M67 was born\nchemically homogeneous. We note there is a significant abundance difference\n($\\sim$ 0.1 - 0.2 dex) between sub-giants and turn-off stars, which can be\ninterpreted as the signature of atomic diffusion. Qualitatively stellar models\nwith diffusion agree with the observed abundance results. Some turn-off stars\ndo not follow the general pattern, which suggests that in some cases diffusion\ncan be inhibited, or they might suffered some sort of mixing event related to\nplanets. Conclusions. Our results pose additional challenges for chemical\ntagging when using turn-off stars. In particular, the effects of atomic\ndiffusion, which could be as large as 0.1 - 0.2 dex, must be taken into account\nin order for chemical tagging to be successfully applied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 10:52:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 13:34:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

Suitable\nphenomenological models for variation of surface tension and surface viscosity\nwith the concentration of surface active agents are incorporated in the\ninterfacial stress boundary condition.

Existing\nmethods aim at fitting new clothes into a person can only transfer clothes on\nthe fixed human pose, but still show unsatisfactory performances which often\nfail to preserve the identity, lose the texture details, and decrease the\ndiversity of poses. In this paper, we make the first attempt towards multi-pose\nguided virtual try-on system, which enables transfer clothes on a person image\nunder diverse poses. Given an input person image, a desired clothes image, and\na desired pose, the proposed Multi-pose Guided Virtual Try-on Network (MG-VTON)\ncan generate a new person image after fitting the desired clothes into the\ninput image and manipulating human poses. Our MG-VTON is constructed in three\nstages: 1) a desired human parsing map of the target image is synthesized to\nmatch both the desired pose and the desired clothes shape; 2) a deep Warping\nGenerative Adversarial Network (Warp-GAN) warps the desired clothes appearance\ninto the synthesized human parsing map and alleviates the misalignment problem\nbetween the input human pose and desired human pose; 3) a refinement render\nutilizing multi-pose composition masks recovers the texture details of clothes\nand removes some artifacts.

In REBCO CORC cables, current redistribution occurs among\ntapes through terminal contact resistances when a local quench occurs.\nTherefore, the quench behaviour of CORC cable is different from single tape\nsituation, for it is significantly affected by terminal contact resistances. To\nbetter understand the underlying physical process of local quenches in CORC\ncables, a new 3D multi-physics modelling tool for CORC cables is developed and\npresented in this paper. In this model, the REBCO tape is treated as a thin\nshell without thickness, and four models are coupled: T-formulation model,\nA-formulation model, a heat transfer model and an equivalent circuit model. The\ncurrent redistribution, temperature and tape voltage of CORC cable during hot\nspot induced quenches are analysed using this model. The results show that the\nthermal stability of CORC cable can be considerably improved by reducing\nterminal contact resistance. The minimum quench energy (MQE) increases rapidly\nwith the reduction of terminal contact resistance when the resistance is in a\nmiddle range. When the terminal contact resistance is too low or too high, the\nMQE shows no obvious variation with terminal contact resistances. With a low\nterminal contact resistance, a hot spot in one tape may induce an over-current\nquench on the other tapes without hot spots. This will not happen in a cable\nwith high terminal contact resistance. In this case, the tape with hot spot\nwill quench and burn out before inducing a quench on other tapes.

Moreover, the\nbest sensitivity of atom-based electrometers is limited by photon shot noise to\nfew $\\mu$Vcm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$: While going beyond is in principle possible by\nusing squeezed light or Schr\\\"odinger-cat state, the former is very challenging\nfor atomic experiments while the latter is feasible in all but very small\natomic systems.

Since then, miners have had a choice between BTC and BCH mining\nbecause they have compatible proof-of-work algorithms. Therefore, they can\nfreely choose which coin to mine for higher profit, where the profitability\ndepends on both the coin price and mining difficulty. Some miners can\nimmediately switch the coin to mine only when mining difficulty changes because\nthe difficulty changes are more predictable than that for the coin price, and\nwe call this behavior fickle mining.\n  In this paper, we study the effects of fickle mining by modeling a game\nbetween two coins. To do this, we consider both fickle miners and some factions\n(e.g., BITMAIN for BCH mining) that stick to mining one coin to maintain that\nchain. In this model, we show that fickle mining leads to a Nash equilibrium in\nwhich only a faction sticking to its coin mining remains as a loyal miner to\nthe less valued coin (e.g., BCH), where loyal miners refer to those who conduct\nmining even after coin mining difficulty increases. This situation would cause\nsevere centralization, weakening the security of the coin system.\n  To determine which equilibrium the competing coin systems (e.g., BTC vs. BCH)\nare moving toward, we traced the historical changes of mining power for BTC and\nBCH. In addition, we analyze the recent \"hash war\" between Bitcoin ABC and SV,\nwhich confirms our theoretical analysis. Finally, we note that our results can\nbe applied to any competing cryptocurrency systems in which the same hardware\n(e.g., ASICs or GPUs) can be used for mining. Therefore, our study brings new\nand important angles in competitive coin markets: a coin can intentionally\nweaken the security and decentralization level of the other rival coin when\nmining hardware is shared between them, allowing for automatic mining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 13:10:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2019 14:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

These\nresults also imply that either gas giant planet formation is extremely rapid\nand occurs before the gas component of discs is evaporated, or gas giants only\nform in low-density star-forming regions where no massive stars are present to\nphotoevaporate gas from protoplanetary discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 14:26:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

Fluctuations of the quantum electrodynamic vacuum epitomize this type\nof physics, but such fluctuation induced forces arise in a wide range of\nsystems. Here we present a surprisingly never anticipated example of\nfluctuation induced radiation forces, stemming from spatially long ranged\nmesoscopic coherent fluctuations of light propagating in random media. Quite\nremarkably, spatially coherent light fluctuations can be thoroughly described\nby a hydrodynamic Langevin approach, where a properly tailored noise accounts\nfor mesoscopic coherent effects. The light flow depends on two parameters only,\nthe diffusion coefficient $D$ and the mobility $\\sigma$, otherwise related by a\nEinstein relation. The mapping we present between coherent light flow and out\nof equilibrium hydrodynamics is easily generalisable to a large class of\nquantum or classical wave problems. A clear asset of this type of approach is\nin its dependence upon two parameters only thus making it a candidate to\nefficient machine learning algorithms. Moreover, the strength of these coherent\nfluctuating forces depends on a single and easily tunable dimensionless\nconductance $g$ -- analog of electronic conductance -- which encapsulates both\nthe geometry and the scattering properties of the random medium. Hence coherent\nmultiple light scattering offers setups where fluctuation induced forces are\nsignificantly enhanced compared to other known situations.

It is\nshown that these effects can be understood in geometrical terms, as a result of\ncoherent and quasi-coherent addition of elliptically polarized natural mode\nwaves. The coherent summation implies that the observed tracks of polarization\nangle (PA) do not always correspond to the natural propagation mode (NPM)\nwaves. Instead, they are statistical average of coherent sum of the NPM waves,\nand can be observed at any (and frequency-dependent) distance from the natural\nmodes. Therefore, the observed tracks of PA can wander arbitrarily far from the\nRVM, and may be non-orthogonal. For equal amplitudes of the NPM waves two pairs\nof orthogonal polarization modes (OPMs), displaced by 45 deg, can be observed,\ndepending on the width of lag distribution. Observed pulsar polarization mainly\nresults from two independent effects: the change of mode amplitude ratio and\nthe change of phase lag. In the core region both effects are superposed on each\nother, which can produce so complex behaviour as observed in the cores of PSR\nB1933+16, B1237+25 and J0437-4715. Change of the phase lag with frequency $\\nu$\nis mostly responsible for the observed strong evolution of these features with\n$\\nu$.

A double-sampling design\nallocates additional resources to pursue a subsample of the dropouts and find\nout their outcomes, which can address potential biases due to non-ignorable\ndropout. It is desirable to construct semiparametric estimators for the\ndouble-sampling design because of their robustness properties. However,\nobtaining such semiparametric estimators remains a challenge due to the\nrequirement of the analytic form of the efficient influence function (EIF), the\nderivation of which can be ad hoc and difficult for the double-sampling design.\nRecent work has shown how the derivation of EIF can be made deductive and\ncomputerizable using the functional derivative representation of the EIF in\nnonparametric models. This approach, however, requires deriving the mixture of\na continuous distribution and a point mass, which can itself be challenging for\ncomplicated problems such as the double-sampling design. We propose\nsemiparametric estimators for the survival probability in double-sampling\ndesigns by generalizing the deductive and computerizable estimation approach.\nIn particular, we propose to build the semiparametric estimators based on a\ndiscretized support structure, which approximates the possibly continuous\nobserved data distribution and circumvents the derivation of the mixture\ndistribution. Our approach is deductive in the sense that it is expected to\nproduce semiparametric locally efficient estimators within finite steps without\nknowledge of the EIF.

A common approach to establish recovery\nguarantees for this convex program relies on the construction of a so-called\napproximate dual certificate.

The Rosetta spacecraft made continuous measurements of the coma of\ncomet 67P/ Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) for more than two years. The plasma in\nthe coma appeared very dynamic, and many factors control its variability. Aims.\nWe wish to identify the effects of solar flares on the comet plasma and also\ntheir effect on the measurements by the Langmuir Probe Instrument (LAP).\nMethods. To identify the effects of flares, we proceeded from an existing flare\ncatalog of Earth-directed solar flares, from which a new list was created that\nonly included Rosetta-directed flares. We also used measurements of flares at\nMars when at similar longitudes as Rosetta. The flare irradiance spectral model\n(FISM v.1) and its Mars equivalent (FISM-M) produce an extreme-ultraviolet\n(EUV) irradiance (10-120 nm) of the flares at 1 min resolution. LAP data and\ndensity measurements obtained with the Mutual Impedence Probe (MIP) from the\ntime of arrival of the flares at Rosetta were examined to determine the flare\neffects. Results. From the vantage point of Earth, 1504 flares directed toward\nRosetta occurred during the mission. In only 24 of these, that is, 1.6%, was\nthe increase in EUV irradiance large enough to cause an observable effect in\nLAP data. Twenty-four Mars-directed flares were also observed in Rosetta data.\nThe effect of the flares was to increase the photoelectron current by typically\n1-5 nA. We find little evidence that the solar flares increase the plasma\ndensity, at least not above the background variability. Conclusions. Solar\nflares have a small effect on the photoelectron current of the LAP instrument,\nand they are not significant in comparison to other factors that control the\nplasma density in the coma. The photoelectron current can only be used for\nflare detection during periods of calm plasma conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 15:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

The output\nrepresentations are then used to train SVMs for the verification. We test our\nOSV system on three different signature datasets, including MCYT (a Spanish\nsignature dataset), UTSig (a Persian one) and GPDS-Synthetic (an artificial\ndataset).

With\ngreater autonomy, they have growing needs for computation and perceiving the\nworld around them through sensors. While todays generation of vehicles carry\nall the necessary sensor data and computation on board, we envision a future\nwhere vehicles can cooperate to increase their perception of the world beyond\ntheir immediate view, resulting in greater safety, coordination and more\ncomfortable experience for their human occupants. In order for vehicles to\nobtain data, compute and other services from other vehicles or road side\ninfrastructure, it is important to be able to make micro payments for those\nservices and for the services to run seamlessly despite the challenges posed by\nmobility and ephemeral interactions with a dynamic set of neighboring devices.\nWe present MOTIVE, a trusted and decentralized framework that allows vehicles\nto make peer to peer micropayments for data, compute and other services\nobtained from other vehicles or road side infrastructure within radio range.\nThe framework utilizes distributed ledger technologies including smart\ncontracts to enable autonomous operation and trusted interactions between\nvehicles and nearby entities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 05:20:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-04"}

To develop a method to extract knowledge stored in a\ntrained classifier, first, the binary-class SEFRON classifier developed earlier\nis extended to handle multi-class problems. MC-SEFRON uses the population\nencoding scheme to encode the real-valued input data into spike patterns.\nMC-SEFRON is trained using the same supervised learning rule used in the\nSEFRON. After training, the proposed method extracts the knowledge for a given\nclass stored in the classifier by mapping the weighted postsynaptic potential\nin the time domain to the feature domain as Feature Strength Functions (FSFs).\nA set of FSFs corresponding to each output class represents the extracted\nknowledge from the classifier. This knowledge encoding method is derived to\nmaintain consistency between the classification in the time domain and the\nfeature domain. The correctness of the FSF is quantitatively measured by using\nFSF directly for classification tasks. For a given input, each FSF is sampled\nat the input value to obtain the corresponding feature strength value (FSV).\nThen the aggregated FSVs obtained for each class are used to determine the\noutput class labels during classification. FSVs are also used to interpret the\npredictions during the classification task. Using ten UCI datasets and the\nMNIST dataset, the knowledge extraction method, interpretation and the\nreliability of the FSF are demonstrated. Based on the studies, it can be seen\nthat on an average, the difference in the classification accuracies using the\nFSF directly and those obtained by MC-SEFRON is only around 0.9% & 0.1\\% for\nthe UCI datasets and the MNIST dataset respectively. This clearly shows that\nthe knowledge represented by the FSFs has acceptable reliability and the\ninterpretability of classification using the classifier's knowledge has been\njustified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 09:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-26"}
