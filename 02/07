We followed a theoretical approach based on mock\ndatasets of artificial stars sampled from a grid of stellar models with a fixed\n$\\alpha_{ml}$. [...] We verified that the $\\alpha_{ml}$ estimates are affected\nby a huge spread, even in the case of perfect agreement between the mock data\nand the recovery grid. When the solar heavy-element mixture used to compute the\nmodels is different from that of the artificial stars, we also found a\nmetallicity relationship in which $\\alpha_{ml}$ increases by 0.4 for an\nincrease of 1 dex in [Fe/H]. The origin of this trend was investigated\nconsidering the differences in the initial helium abundance Y -- [Fe/H] --\ninitial metallicity Z relation assumed in the models and data. A discrepancy\nbetween the adopted helium-to-metal enrichment ratio caused the appearance of\nrelevant spurious trends in the estimated $\\alpha_{ml}$. [...] A similar effect\nwas caused by an offset in the [Fe/H] to Z conversion. An overestimation of\n[Fe/H] by 0.1 dex in the recovery grid forced an increasing trend of\n$\\alpha_{ml}$ versus [Fe/H] of 0.2 per dex. We also explored the impact of some\ndiscrepancies between the adopted input physics in the recovery grid and mock\ndata. We observed a trend with [Fe/H] of 0.3 per dex when the effect of the\nmicroscopic diffusion is neglected in the recovery grid [...]. Therefore, any\nattempt to calibrate the mixing-length parameter by means of classical and\nasteroseimic observables of field stars seems to be statistically poorly\nreliable.

We examine the temporal and spatial\nevolution of puffs and slugs in a toroidal pipe with pipe-to-torus diameter\nratio $\\delta = D/d = 0.01$ at several subcritical Reynolds numbers. Results\nshow that the upstream overshoot of TKE production is at most one-and-a-half\ntimes the value in the core and that the average cross-flow fluctuations at the\nfront are up to three times lower if compared to a straight pipe, while\nattaining similar values in the core. Localised turbulence can be sustained at\nsmaller energies through a redistribution of turbulent fluctuations and\nvortical structures by the in-plane Dean motion of the mean flow. This\nasymmetry determines a strong localisation of TKE production near the outer\nbend, where linear and nonlinear mechanisms optimally amplify perturbations.

In a typical indoor environment, a top-1 accuracy of $97.12 \\pm\n1.13\\%$ is achieved for a dataset of 30 people.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 17:51:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-07"}

The\nLorentz group acts on the celestial sphere by conformal transformation and the\nsoft-operators transform as conformal primary operators of various dimension\nand spin. Working in space-time dimensions $D=4$ and $6$, we study some\nproperties of the conformal representations with the (leading) soft photon and\ngraviton as the highest weight vectors. Typically these representations contain\nnull-vectors. We argue, from the $S$-matrix point of view, that infinite\ndimensional asymptotic symmetries and conformal invariance require us to set\nsome of these null-vectors to zero. As a result, the corresponding\nsoft-operator satisfies linear PDE on the celestial sphere. Curiously, these\nPDEs are equations of motion of Euclidean gauge theories on the celestial\nsphere with scalar gauge-invariance, i.e, the gauge parameter is a scalar field\non the sphere. These are probably related to large $U(1)$ and supertranslation\ntransformations at infinity. Now, the PDE satisfied by the soft-operator can be\nconverted into PDE for the $S$-matrix elements with the insertion of the\nsoft-operator. These equations can then be solved subject to appropriate\nboundary conditions on the celestial sphere, provided by conformal invariance.\nThe solutions determine the soft $S$-matrix elements, for different helicities\nof the soft-particle, in terms of a single scalar function. This makes the\nWard-identity for the asymptotic symmetry almost integrable. The result of the\nintegration, which we are not able to perform completely, should of course be\nWeinberg's soft-theorem. Finally, we comment on the similarity between the\nroles played by null-states in the context of asymptotic symmetry and in string\ntheory in relation to space-time gauge symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 18:07:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 13:39:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 14:33:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 13 Apr 2019 15:14:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

This term plays a key role in the fulfillment of a discrete Korn\ninequality on broken polynomial spaces, for which a novel proof valid for\ngeneral polyhedral meshes is provided.

For example, the highly complex cortical\nfolding pattern makes it hard to accurately align corresponding cortical\nstructures of individual images. In this paper, we propose a novel deep\nlearning way to simplify the difficult registration problem of brain MR images.\nMethods: We train a morphological simplification network (MS-Net), which can\ngenerate a \"simple\" image with less anatomical details based on the \"complex\"\ninput. With MS-Net, the complexity of the fixed image or the moving image under\nregistration can be reduced gradually, thus building an individual\n(simplification) trajectory represented by MS-Net outputs. Since the generated\nimages at the ends of the two trajectories (of the fixed and moving images) are\nso simple and very similar in appearance, they are easy to register. Thus, the\ntwo trajectories can act as a bridge to link the fixed and the moving images,\nand guide their registration. Results: Our experiments show that the proposed\nmethod can achieve highly accurate registration performance on different\ndatasets (i.e., NIREP, LPBA, IBSR, CUMC, and MGH). Moreover, the method can be\nalso easily transferred across diverse image datasets and obtain superior\naccuracy on surface alignment.

To\naddress this challenge, candidate systems increasingly integrate heterogeneous\ncores in order to satisfy diverse computation requirements by selecting cores\nwith suitable features. In particular, single-ISA heterogeneous multicore\nprocessors such as ARM big.LITTLE have become very attractive since they offer\ngood opportunities in terms of performance and power consumption trade-off.\nWhile existing works already showed that this feature can improve system\nenergy-efficiency, further gains are possible by generalizing the principle to\nhigher levels of heterogeneity. The present paper aims to explore these gains\nby considering single-ISA heterogeneous multicore architectures including three\ndifferent types of cores. For this purpose, we use the Samsung Exynos Octa 5422\nchip as baseline architecture. Then, we model and evaluate Cortex A7, A9, and\nA15 cores using the gem5 simulation framework coupled to McPAT for power\nestimation. We demonstrate that varying the level of heterogeneity as well as\nthe different core ratio can lead to up to 2.3x gains in energy efficiency and\nup to 1.5x in performance. This study further provides insights on the impact\nof workload nature on performance/energy trade-off and draws recommendations\nconcerning suitable architecture configurations. This contributes in fine to\nguide future research towards dynamically reconfigurable HSAs in which some\ncores/clusters can be disabled momentarily so as to optimize certain metrics\nsuch as energy efficiency.

Knowing whether starbursts are triggered by\nan increase of the quantity of dense gas or an increase of the star formation\nefficiency would improve our understanding of galaxy evolution and allow to\ntranspose the results obtained in the local Universe to high redshift galaxies.\nIn this paper, we analyze a parsec-resolution simulation of an Antennae-like\nmodel of interacting galaxies. We find that the interplay of physical processes\nhas complex and important variations in time and space, through different\ncombinations of mechanisms like tides, shear and turbulence. These can have\nsimilar imprints on observables like depletion time and CO emission. The\ndensest gas only constitutes the tail of the density distribution of some\nclouds, but exists in large excess in others. The super-linearity of the star\nformation rate dependence on gas density implies that this excess translates\ninto a reduction of depletion times, and thus leads to a deviation from the\nclassical star formation regime, visible up to galactic scales. These clouds\nare found in all parts of the galaxies, but their number density varies from\none region to the next, due to different cloud assembly mechanisms. Therefore,\nthe dependence of cloud and star formation-related quantities (like CO flux and\ndepletion time) on the scale at which they are measured also varies across the\ngalaxies. We find that the $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}$ conversion factor between the CO\nluminosity and molecular gas mass has even stronger spatial than temporal\nvariations in a system like the Antennae.

One of the state-of-the-art simulators, that of\nBravyi et al, utilizes a randomized sparsification technique to approximate the\noutput state of a quantum circuit by a stabilizer sum with a reduced number of\nterms. In this paper, we describe an improved Monte Carlo algorithm for\nperforming randomized sparsification. This algorithm reduces the runtime of\ncomputing the approximate state by the factor $\\ell/m$, where $\\ell$ and $m$\nare respectively the total and non-Clifford gate counts. The main technique is\na circuit recompilation routine based on manipulating exponentiated Pauli\noperators. The recompilation routine also facilitates numerical search for\nClifford decompositions of products of gates, which can further reduce the\nruntime in certain cases. It may additionally lead to a framework for\noptimizing circuit implementations over a gate set, reducing the overhead for\nstate-injection in fault-tolerant implementations. We provide a concise\nexposition of randomized sparsification, and describe how to use it to estimate\ncircuit amplitudes in a way which can be generalized to a broader class of\ngates and states. This latter method can be used to obtain additive error\nestimates of circuit probabilities with a faster runtime than the full\ntechniques of Bravyi et al.

The bias can be\nlarge even for highly accurate classification algorithms, in particular when\ndealing with class-imbalanced data. To correct this bias, the algorithm's\nclassification error rates have to be estimated. In this estimation, two issues\narise when applying existing bias correction methods.

In this\nwork, we study a vehicle service provider who can generate different ad\nrevenues when displaying ads on different arcs (i.e., origin-destination\npairs). The provider needs to ensure the vehicle flow balance at each location,\nwhich makes it challenging to analyze the provider's vehicle assignment and\npricing decisions for different arcs. For example, the provider's price for its\nservice on an arc depends on the ad revenues on other arcs as well as on the\narc in question. To tackle the problem, we show that the traffic network\ncorresponds to an electrical network. When the effective resistance between two\nlocations is small, there are many paths between the two locations and the\nprovider can easily route vehicles between them. We characterize the dependence\nof an arc's optimal price on any other arc's ad revenue using the effective\nresistances between these two arcs' origins and destinations.

We recently proposed such an\nextension that applies to general graphs and binary vertex labels [AB18], using\nsynchronization models and relying on percolation bounds. This extension\nrequires however the edge channels to be symmetric on the product of the\nadjacent spins. A more general version of such a percolation bound that applies\nto asymmetric channels is also obtained in [PW18], relying on the SDPI, but the\nsubadditivity property does not follow with such generalizations.\n  In this note, we provide a new result showing that the subadditivity property\nstill holds for arbitrary (asymmetric) channels acting on the product of spins,\nwhen the graphs are restricted to be series-parallel. The proof relies on the\nuse of the Chi-squared mutual information rather than the classical mutual\ninformation, and various properties of the former are discussed.\n  We also present a generalization of the broadcasting on tree model (the\nsynchronization on tree) where the bound from [PW18] relying on the SPDI can be\nsignificantly looser than the bound resulting from the Chi-squared\nsubadditivity property presented here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 23:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-08"}

The simple\ndesign approach, and their capability to continuously learn has led to their\nwidespread use in different autonomous applications. Despite their simplicity\nand impressive capabilities, these models are difficult to assure, which makes\ntheir use challenging. The problem of assuring CPS with untrusted controllers\nhas been achieved using the Simplex Architecture. This architecture integrates\nthe system to be assured with a safe controller and provides a decision logic\nto switch between the decisions of these controllers. However, the key\nchallenges in using the Simplex Architecture are: (1) designing an effective\ndecision logic, and (2) sudden transitions between controller decisions lead to\ninconsistent system performance. To address these research challenges, we make\nthree key contributions: (1) \\textit{dynamic-weighted simplex strategy} -- we\nintroduce ``weighted simplex strategy\" as the weighted ensemble extension of\nthe classical Simplex Architecture.

After\nthe damping of such oscillations the system is found in a quasi-stationary\nstate that survives virtually forever when the system is very large. During\nviolent relaxation the distribution function obeys the collisionless Boltzmann\n(or Vlasov) equation, that, being invariant under time reversal, does not\n\"naturally\" describe a relaxation process.

By treating the plume as a black body, and\ncalculating a radiative configuration factor corresponding to the geometry of\nthe plume and the detector, we calculated average plume temperatures at each of\nthe three oxidizer-to-fuel ratios. The estimated plume temperatures were\nbetween 850 and 950 K for all three combustion conditions. The temperature is\nroughly invariant for a fixed fuel concentration for the three tested\ndistances. These data demonstrate the functionality of GaN as a material\nplatform for use in harsh environment flame monitoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 02:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-08"}

The\ngoverning equations are Navier-Stokes equations. They are discretized with\nfinite volume method (FVM) and the solution is iterated with PISO Algorithm.\nThen, the calculating results are compared with the numerical results in\nliterature, and good agreements are obtained. After that, the mechanism of the\nformation of Karman vortex street is investigated and the instability of the\nentire flow field is analyzed with the energy gradient theory. It is found that\nthe two eddies attached at the rear of the cylinder have no effect on the flow\ninstability for steady flow, i.e., they don't contribute to the formation of\nKarman vortex street. The formation of Karman vortex street originates from the\ncombinations of the interaction of two shear layers at two lateral sides of the\ncylinder and the absolute instability in the cylinder wake. For the flow with\nKarman vortex street, the initial instability occurs at the region inner a\nvortex downstream of the wake and the center of a vortex firstly loses its\nstability inner a vortex. For pressure driven flow, it is confirmed that the\ninflection point on the time-averaged velocity profile leads to the\ninstability. It is concluded that the energy gradient theory is potentially\napplicable to study the flow stability and to reveal the mechanism of turbulent\ntransition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 03:31:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

Different from existing methods, the proposed method\ndisentangles the attributes of an object into ``shape'' and ``appearance''\nwhich are modeled separately by the mixture weights and the mixture components.\nMore specifically, each object in the visual scene is fully characterized by\none latent representation, which is in turn transformed into parameters of the\nmixture weight and the mixture component by two neural networks.

However, it is known that the LES equations usually employed in\npractical applications are inconsistent with the filter operator when no\nexplicit filter is used. Moreover, even for explicitly filtered LES, some\ninconsistencies remain in the wall-normal direction due to the constraining\neffect of the wall. A typically undesirable effect stemming from the\ninconsistency between LES and the filtered NS (fNS) equations is that DNS data\ncan not be used to aid SGS modeling. Using the proposed form of the\nincompressible fNS equations for flows over flat walls in which the continuity\nequation, the filter operator, and the boundary condition at the wall are\nconsistently formulated, we compute a set of plane turbulent channel flow\nexplicitly filtered LES at different grid resolutions with the SGS term\ncomputed from a parallel DNS computation starting with an equivalent initial\ncondition. The results show that the SGS term computed from DNS provide a\ntruthful SGS model for short times until the numerical errors compound and the\ntwo parallel computations diverge. The effective time where the statistics\nremain similar is longer for lower-order statistics such as mean velocity\nprofile, as expected. This demonstrates that with the consistent fNS equations,\nthe abundant DNS data can be used to inform SGS model development for\nexplicitly filtered LES. Moreover, the diverging of statitics at longer times\nshows that the SGS contribution is not necessarily homogeous as most SGS models\nassume, and a more precise correlation between the instantaneous LES velocity\nfield and SGS model is required to capture the dynamics of turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 07:44:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-08"}

A firm understanding of these processes needs an accurate\nprescription of flow dynamics near the interface which (in turn) hinges on an\nappropriate description of interface conditions along the interface of\nfree-porous media. Although the conditions for the flow dynamics at the\ninterface of free-porous media have received considerable attention, many of\nthese studies were empirical and lacked a firm theoretical underpinning. In\nthis paper, we derive a complete and self-consistent set of conditions for flow\ndynamics at the interface of free-porous media. We first propose a principle of\nvirtual power by incorporating the virtual power expended at the interface of\nfree-porous media. Then by appealing to the calculus of variations, we obtain a\ncomplete set of interface conditions for flows in coupled free-porous media. A\nnoteworthy feature of our approach is that the derived interface conditions\napply to a wide variety of porous media models. We also show that the two most\npopular interface conditions -- the Beavers-Joseph condition and the\nBeavers-Joseph-Saffman condition -- are special cases of the approach presented\nin this paper. The proposed principle of virtual power also provides a minimum\npower theorem for a class of flows in coupled free-porous media, which has a\nsimilar mathematical structure as the ones enjoyed by flows in uncoupled free\nand porous media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 07:45:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 03:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

To this aim, we present a\nnumerical investigation of the rheology of equilibrium gels in which a\nshort-range depletion is complemented by a long-range electrostatic\ninteraction. We observe a single yielding event in the stress-strain curve,\noccurring at a fixed strain. The stress overshoot is found to follow a\npower-law dependence on the P\\'eclet number, with an exponent larger than that\nfound in depletion gels, suggesting that its value may depend systematically on\nthe underlying colloid-colloid interactions. We also establish a mapping\nbetween equilibrium states and steady states under shear, which allows us to\nidentify the structural modifications induced by the presence of the shear.\nRemarkably, we find that steady states corresponding to the same P\\'eclet\nnumber, obtained by different combinations of shear rate and solvent viscosity,\nshow identical structural and rheological properties. Our results highlight the\nimportance of understanding the coupling between colloidal interactions,\nsolvent effects, and flow to be able to describe the microscopic organization\nof colloidal particles under shear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 09:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-08"}

For that, cryptographic TLS state from previous connections is\nreused. TLS version 1.3 recommends to avoid resumption handshakes, and thus the\nreuse of cryptographic state, when connecting to a different hostname. In this\nwork, we reassess this recommendation, as we find that sharing cryptographic\nTLS state across hostnames is a common practice on the web. We propose a TLS\nextension that allows the server to inform the client about TLS state sharing\nwith other hostnames. This information enables the client to efficiently resume\nTLS sessions across hostnames. Our evaluation indicates that our TLS extension\nprovides huge performance gains for the web. For example, about 58.7% of the\n20.24 full TLS handshakes that are required to retrieve an average website on\nthe web can be converted to resumed connection establishments. This yields to a\nreduction of 44% of the CPU time consumed for TLS connection establishments.\nFurthermore, our TLS extension accelerates the connection establishment with an\naverage website by up to 30.6% for TLS 1.3.

A single SNAREpin takes about 1\nsecond to fuse two bilayers, yet a handful can ensure release of\nneurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles much faster, in a 10th of a\nmillisecond. We propose that, similar to the case of muscle myosins, the\nultrafast fusion results from cooperative action of many SNAREpins. The\ncoupling originates from mechanical interactions induced by confining\nscaffolds. Each SNAREpin is known to have enough energy to overcome the fusion\nbarrier of 25-35 kB T, however, the fusion barrier only becomes relevant when\nthe SNAREpins are nearly completely zippered and from this state each SNAREpin\ncan deliver only a small fraction of this energy as mechanical work. Therefore\nthey have to act cooperatively and we show that at least 3 of them are needed\nto ensure fusion in less than a millisecond. However, to reach the pre-fusion\nstate collectively, starting from the experimentally observed half-zippered\nmetastable state, the SNAREpins have to mechanically synchronize which takes\nexponentially longer time as the number of SNAREpins increases. Incorporating\nthis somewhat counter-intuitive idea in a simple coarse grained model results\nin the novel prediction that there should be an optimum number of SNAREpins for\nsub-ms fusion: 3-6 over a wide range of parameters.

The actor performs actions in the environment, while\nthe critic evaluates the actor's current policy. However, despite their\nstability and promising convergence properties, current actor-critic algorithms\ndo not outperform critic-only ones in practice. We believe that the fact that\nthe critic learns Q^pi, instead of the optimal Q-function Q*, prevents\nstate-of-the-art robust and sample-efficient off-policy learning algorithms\nfrom being used. In this paper, we propose an elegant solution, the\nActor-Advisor architecture, in which a Policy Gradient actor learns from\nunbiased Monte-Carlo returns, while being shaped (or advised) by the Softmax\npolicy arising from an off-policy critic. The critic can be learned\nindependently from the actor, using any state-of-the-art algorithm. Being\nadvised by a high-quality critic, the actor quickly and robustly learns the\ntask, while its use of the Monte-Carlo return helps overcome any bias the\ncritic may have. In addition to a new Actor-Critic formulation, the\nActor-Advisor, a method that allows an external advisory policy to shape a\nPolicy Gradient actor, can be applied to many other domains. By varying the\nsource of advice, we demonstrate the wide applicability of the Actor-Advisor to\nthree other important subfields of RL: safe RL with backup policies, efficient\nleverage of domain knowledge, and transfer learning in RL. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate the benefits of the Actor-Advisor compared to\nstate-of-the-art actor-critic methods, illustrate its applicability to the\nthree other application scenarios listed above, and show that many important\nchallenges of RL can now be solved using a single elegant solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 10:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-08"}

The\nhigh-order nature of the coupled PDE system is addressed by a sufficiently\nsmooth hierarchical B-spline approximation on a background Cartesian mesh. The\ndomain of interest is embedded into the background mesh and discretized in an\nunfitted fashion. The immersed boundary approach allows us to use B-splines on\narbitrary domain shapes, regardless of their geometrical complexity, and could\nbe directly extended, for instance, to shape and topology optimization. The\ndomain boundary is represented by NURBS, and exactly integrated by means of the\nNEFEM mapping. Local adaptivity is achieved by hierarchical refinement of\nB-spline basis, which are efficiently evaluated and integrated thanks to their\npiecewise polynomial definition. Nitsche's formulation is derived to weakly\nenforce essential boundary conditions, accounting also for the non-local\nconditions on the non-smooth portions of the domain boundary (i.e. edges in 3D\nor corners in 2D) arising from Mindlin's strain gradient elasticity theory.\nBoundary conditions modeling sensing electrodes are formulated and enforced\nfollowing the same approach. Optimal error convergence rates are reported using\nhigh-order B-spline approximations. The method is verified against available\nanalytical solutions and well-known benchmarks from the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 11:22:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 12:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-08"}

For x = 0.0,\n0.5, and 1.0, the maximum entropy changes of the giant inverse MCE are found to\nbe 22.7 J/kgK, 19.6 J/kgK, and 19.0 J/kgK with critical fields of 25 kOe, 40\nkOe, and 50 kOe, respectively. It is remarkable that such a giant MCE is\nrealized, even when applying a low magnetic field, which enables a field-tuned\nentropy change and brings about a significant advantage for several\napplications. For all compounds, we have systematically studied how the entropy\nchanges as a function of the field and temperature and investigated their\ncorrelation with consecutive double transitions, i.e., the magnetic dipolar\norder at T = TN and the quadrupolar order at T = TQ (TQ < TN). We found that\nthe maximum entropy change occurs at T = TQ and the critical field associated\nwith the meta-magnetic transition, which is in good agreement with the\nexperimental data. Thus, we elucidate that this unique behaviour is attributed\nto the strong coupling between magnetic dipoles and quadrupoles in the presence\nof strong spin-orbit coupling and geometric frustration.

Additionally we carried out photometric and\nspectroscopic monitoring of the system and fitted synthetic spectra to the\nobservations. Carbon abundance in the photosphere of the red giant is\nsignificantly higher than that derived for the nebula, which confirms pollution\nof the circumbinary material by the ejecta from nova outburst. The photometric\nand spectroscopic data show that the system reached quiescence in 2009, which\nmeans that for the first time all of the phases of a nova outburst were\nobserved in an extragalactic symbiotic star. The data indicate that most\nprobably there were three outbursts observed in LMC S154, which would make this\nsystem a member of a rare class of symbiotic recurrent novae. The recurrent\nnature of the system is supported by the discovery of coronal lines in the\nspectra, which are observed only in symbiotic stars with massive white dwarfs\nand with short-recurrence-time outbursts. Gathered evidence is sufficient to\nclassify LMC S154 as the first bona fide extragalactic symbiotic nova, which is\nlikely a recurrent nova. It is also the first nova with a carbon-rich donor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 14:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

Since wettability\nmeasurements are extremely sensitive to experimental conditions, we propose a\ngeneral approach to obtain contact angles between water and ceria surfaces of\nspecified orientations based on density functional calculations. In particular,\nwe analysed the low index surfaces of this oxide to establish their\ninteractions with water. According to our calculations, the CeO2 (111) surface\nwas the most hydrophobic with a contact angle of {\\Theta} = 112.53{\\deg}\nfollowed by (100) with {\\Theta} = 93.91{\\deg}. The CeO2 (110) surface was, on\nthe other hand, mildly hydrophilic with {\\Theta} = 64.09{\\deg}. By combining\nour calculations with an atomistic thermodynamic approach, we found that the O\nterminated (100) surface was unstable unless fully covered by molecularly\nadsorbed water. We also identified a strong attractive interaction between the\nhydrogen atoms in water molecules and surface oxygen, which gives rise to the\nhydrophilic behaviour of (110) surfaces. Interestingly, the adsorption of water\nmolecules on the lower-energy (111) surface stabilises oxygen vacancies, which\nare expected to enhance the catalytic activity of this plane. The findings here\nshed light on the origin of the intrinsic wettability of rare earth oxides in\ngeneral and CeO2 surfaces in particular and also explain why CeO2 (100) surface\nproperties are so critically dependant on applied synthesis methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 14:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-08"}

Magneto-oscillations due to the Landau quantization\nare examined for the thermoelectric voltages between the contact pairs\nstraddling the main bar (arrangement to measure the transverse component\n$V_{yx}$), and between the pairs located along the same side of the main bar\n(arrangement for the longitudinal component $V_{xx}$).

For the latter arrangement, the pair on one side exhibits much larger\namplitude than the pair on the opposite side, and the relation becomes reversed\nby inverting the magnetic field. The behaviours of the oscillation amplitude\nare qualitatively explained by the spatial distribution of the electron\ntemperature numerically calculated taking into consideration the thermal\ndiffusion into the voltage contacts and the electron-phonon interaction.

Bug\nlocalization is such a typical task, where text in a bug report is analyzed to\nidentify file locations in the source code that can be associated to the\nreported bug. Despite the promising results, the performance offered by\nIR-based bug localization tools is still not significant for large adoption. We\nargue that one reason could be the attempt to build a one-size-fits-all\napproach. In this paper, we extensively study the performance of\nstate-of-the-art bug localization tools, focusing on query formulation and its\nimportance with respect to the localization performance. Building on insights\nfrom this study, we propose a new learning approach where multiple classifier\nmodels are trained on clear-cut sets of bug-location pairs. Concretely, we\napply a gradient boosting supervised learning approach to various sets of bug\nreports whose localizations appear to be successful with specific types of\nfeatures. The training scenario builds on our findings that the various\nstate-of-the-art localization tools can be highly performant for specific sets\nof bug reports.

By analyzing the\nvariation of the mean rotation period, $\\overline{T}$, of the Hilbert phase as\na function of $\\tau$, we discover well-defined plateaus.

In the\nmodel, cells are described as agents evolving and interacting in a 2D\nenvironment while a set of differential equations, embedded in each cell,\nmodels the regulation of intra and extracellular proteins involved in cell\ndifferentiation. Based on the analysis of in silico data at the single cell\nlevel, we 1 show that immune response dynamics can be explained by the\nmolecular-content heterogeneity generated by uneven partitioning at cell\ndivision. In particular, uneven partitioning acts as a regulator of cell\ndifferentiation and induces the emergence of two coexisting sub-populations of\ncells exhibiting antagonistic fates. We show that the degree of unevenness of\nmolecular partitioning, along all cell divisions, affects the outcome of the\nimmune response and can promote the generation of memory cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 15:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

The model is plausibly evolvable with respect to the origins of\nthe molecular components and the scaling of the system from simple cells to\nneurons. The mixed chemical potentials are calculated by summing the\nconcentrations or particle numbers of the two constituent ions which are pure\nnumbers and thus dimensionless. Chemical potentials are true thermodynamic free\nGibbs/Fermi energies and the forces acting on chemical flows are calculated\nfrom the natural logarithms of the particle numbers or their concentrations.\nThe mixed chemical potential is converted to the time domain of an action\npotential by assuming that the injection of calcium ions accelerates\ndepolarization in direct proportion to the amplitude of the total charge\ncontribution of the calcium pulse. We assert that the natural logarithm of the\nreal component of the imaginary term of any Riemann zeta zero corresponds to an\ninstantaneous calcium potential. In principle, in a physiologically plausible\nfashion, the first few thousand Riemann zeta-zeros can be encoded on this\nchemical scale manifested as regulated step-changes in the amplitudes of\nnaturally occurring calcium current transients. We show that pairs of Zn\nchannels can form Dirac fences which encode the logarithmic spacings and summed\namplitudes of any pair of Riemann zeros. Remarkably the beat frequencies of the\npairings of the early frequency terms overlap the naturally occurring frequency\nmodes in vertebrate brains. The equation for the time domain in the biological\nmodel has a similar form to the Riemann zeta function on the half-plane and\nmimics analytical continuation on the complex plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 12:04:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

In this work, we present an inherent and\nself-reliant vibration isolation mechanism in architected periodic chains of\nserially pivoted pendulums. Absorption of external excitations is achieved by\nvirtue of Bragg-type band gaps which stem from the emergent chain dynamics.\nOwing to its coupled dynamics, the self-repeating cell of a Phononic Crystal\n(PC) is not trivial and cannot be readily identified from the periodic\narrangement by inspection. As such, this work entails the extraction of a\n\"pseudo\" unit cell of an equivalent PC lattice from the derived motion\nequations of a finite chain, which departs from traditional wave dispersion\nmethods. The model presented herein comprises a chain of linked pendulums with\nperiodic variations of inertial/geometrical properties, carrying a payload at\none end. We ultimately show evidence of forbidden wave propagation in\nprescribed frequency regimes, reminiscent of band gaps in PC lattices. The\npresented framework can be invaluable in applications that require vibration\nreduction in the delivery of payloads including gantry cranes, robotic arms and\nspace tethers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 21:43:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 22:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}
