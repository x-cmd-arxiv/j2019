Thanks to the demonstrated optimal characteristics of the sub-millimetre\ngalaxies (SMGs) for lensing analysis, in this work we were able to measure the\nmagnification bias produced by a sample of QSOs acting as lenses, $0.2<z<1.0$,\non the SMGs observed by Herschel at $1.2<z<4.0$. Two different methodologies\nwere successfully applied: the traditional cross-correlation function approach\nand the Davis-Peebles estimator through stacking technique. The second one was\nfound to be more robust for analysing the strong lensing regime ($<20-30$\narcsec in our case) and provides the possibility to take into account the\npositional errors of the sources in our samples. From the halo modelling of the\ncross-correlation function, the halo mass where the QSOs acting as lenses are\nlocated was estimated to be greater than $\\log_{10}{(M_{min}/M_\\odot)} >\n13.6_{-0.4}^{+0.9}$, also confirmed by the mass density profile analysis\n($M_{200c}\\sim 10^{14} M_\\odot$). These mass values indicate that we are\nobserving the lensing effect of a cluster size halo signposted by the QSOs, as\nin previous studies of the magnification bias. Moreover, we were able to\nestimate the lensing convergence, $\\kappa(\\theta)$, for our magnification bias\nmeasurements down to a few kpcs. The derived mass density profile is in good\nagreement with a Navarro-Frank-White (NFW) profile. We also attempt an\nestimation of the halo mass and the concentration parameters, obtaining\n$M_{NFW}=1.0^{+0.4}_{-0.2}\\times10^{14} M_\\odot$ and $C=3.5_{-0.3}^{+0.5}$.\nThis concentration value is rather low and it would indicate that the cluster\nhalos around these QSOs are unrelaxed. However, higher concentration values\nstill provides a compatible fit to the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2019 16:11:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 10:49:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 11:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

We contribute to the WGAN literature\nby introducing the family of $(q,p)$-Wasserstein GANs, which allow the use of\nmore general $p$-Wasserstein metrics for $p\\geq 1$ in the GAN learning\nprocedure. While the method is able to incorporate any cost function as the\nground metric, we focus on studying the $l^q$ metrics for $q\\geq 1$. This is a\nnotable generalization as in the WGAN literature the OT distances are commonly\nbased on the $l^2$ ground metric. We demonstrate the effect of different\n$p$-Wasserstein distances in two toy examples. Furthermore, we show that the\nground metric does make a difference, by comparing different $(q,p)$ pairs on\nthe MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that changing the\nground metric and $p$ can notably improve on the common $(q,p) = (2,1)$ case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2019 17:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

The adopted experimental protocol involved probing the linear\nchain dynamics in different star environments. To this end, we studied mixtures\nwith different star mass fraction, which was kept constant while linear chains\nwere added and their entanglement plateau modulus ($G_p$) and terminal\nrelaxation time ($\\tau_d$) were measured as functions of their concentration.\nTwo distinct scaling regimes were observed for both $G_p$ and $\\tau_d$: at low\nlinear polymer concentrations, a weak concentration dependence was observed,\nthat became even weaker as the fraction of stars in the mixtures increased into\nthe star glassy regime. On the other hand, at higher linear polymer\nconcentrations, the classical entangled polymer scaling was recovered. Simple\nscaling arguments show that the threshold crossover concentration between the\ntwo regimes corresponds to the maximum osmotic star compression and signals the\ntransition from confined to bulk dynamics.

Recently, the problem has been well characterized for 2\ndimensions for deterministic as well as randomized agents, both in synchronous\nand semi-synchronous models. It has been conjectured that $n+1$ randomized\nagents are necessary to solve this problem in the $n$-dimensional grid. In this\npaper we disprove the conjecture in a strong sense: we show that three\nrandomized synchronous agents suffice to explore an $n$-dimensional grid for\nany $n$. Our algorithm is optimal in terms of the number of the agents. Our key\ninsight is that a constant number of finite state machine agents can, by their\npositions and movements, implement a stack, which can store the path being\nexplored. We also show how to implement our algorithm using: four randomized\nsemi-synchronous agents; four deterministic synchronous agents; or five\ndeterministic semi-synchronous agents.\n  We give a different algorithm that uses $4$ deterministic semi-synchronous\nagents for the $3$-dimensional grid. This is provably optimal, and\nsurprisingly, matches the result for $2$ dimensions. For $n\\geq 4$, the time\ncomplexity of the solutions mentioned above is exponential in distance $D$ of\nthe treasure from the starting point of the agents. We show that in the\ndeterministic case, one additional agent brings the time down to a polynomial.\nFinally, we focus on algorithms that never venture much beyond the distance\n$D$. We describe an algorithm that uses $O(\\sqrt{n})$ semi-synchronous\ndeterministic agents that never go beyond $2D$, as well as show that any\nalgorithm using $3$ synchronous deterministic agents in $3$ dimensions must\ntravel beyond $\\Omega(D^{3/2})$ from the origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 01:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

By inferring\nlocations and orientations of the non-transmitting antennas from an incomplete\nset of uplink channels, ARDI can reconstruct the downlink channels for\nnon-transmitting antennas. We derive a closed-form solution to reconstruct\nantenna orientation in both single-path and multi-path propagation\nenvironments.

However, most\nof these IoT devices are generally not perfect-by-design even have security\nweaknesses or vulnerabilities. Thus, it is essential to update these IoT\ndevices securely, patching their vulnerabilities and protecting the safety of\nthe involved users. Existing studies deliver secure and reliable updates based\non blockchain network which serves as the transmission network. However, these\napproaches could compromise users privacy when updating the IoT devices.\n  In this paper, we propose a new blockchain based privacy-preserving software\nupdates protocol, which delivers secure and reliable updates with an incentive\nmechanism, as well protects the privacy of involved users. The vendor delivers\nthe updates and it makes a commitment by using a smart contract to provide\nfinancial incentive to the transmission nodes who deliver the updates to the\nIoT devices. A transmission node gets financial incentive by providing a\nproof-of-delivery. The transmission node uses double authentication preventing\nsignature (DAPS) to carry out the fair exchange to obtain the\nproof-of-delivery. Specifically, the transmission node exchanges an\nattribute-based signature from a IoT device by using DAPS. Then, it uses the\nattribute-based signature as a proof-of-delivery to receive financial\nincentives. Generally, the IoT device has to execute complex computation for an\nattribute-based signature (ABS). It is intolerable for resource limited\ndevices. We propose a concrete outsourced attribute-based signature (OABS)\nscheme to resist the weakness. Then, we prove the security of the proposed OABS\nand the protocol as well. Finally, we implement smart contract in Solidity to\ndemonstrate the validity of the proposed protocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 03:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

Several experimental designs\nhave been proposed using networks made of silver nanowires, carbon nanotubes\nand metal meshes with high sensitivities. However, there is limited theoretical\nunderstanding; the reported studies have taken the numerical approach and only\nconsider rearrangement of nanowires with strain, while the critical break-make\nproperty of the sensor observed experimentally has largely been ignored.\nHerein, we propose a generic geometrical based model and study distortion,\nincluding the break-make aspect, and change in electrical percolation of the\nnetwork on applying strain. The result shows that when a given strain is\napplied, wire segments below a critical angle with respect to the applied\nstrain direction end up breaking, leading to increased resistance of the\nnetwork. The percolation shows interesting attributes; the calculated\nresistance increases linearly in the beginning and at a higher rate for higher\nstrains, consistent with the experimental findings. In a real scenario, the\nstrain direction need not necessarily be in the direction of measurement, and\ntherefore, strain value and its direction both are incorporated into the\ntreatment. The study reveals interesting anisotropic conduction features;\nstrain sensitivity is higher parallel to the strain, while strain range is\nwider for perpendicular measurement. The percolation is also investigated on\ndirect microscopic images of metal networks to obtain resistance-strain\ncharacteristics and identification of current percolation pathways. The\nfindings will be important for electrical percolation in general, particularly\nin predicting characteristics and improvising metal network-based strain\nsensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 06:48:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-09"}

In many\nmodern SLAM pipelines, bundle adjustment is performed to estimate the 6DOF\ncamera trajectory and 3D map (3D point cloud) from the input feature tracks.\nHowever, two fundamental weaknesses plague SLAM systems based on bundle\nadjustment. First, the need to carefully initialise bundle adjustment means\nthat all variables, in particular the map, must be estimated as accurately as\npossible and maintained over time, which makes the overall algorithm\ncumbersome. Second, since estimating the 3D structure (which requires\nsufficient baseline) is inherent in bundle adjustment, the SLAM algorithm will\nencounter difficulties during periods of slow motion or pure rotational motion.\n  We propose a different SLAM optimisation core: instead of bundle adjustment,\nwe conduct rotation averaging to incrementally optimise only camera\norientations.

This might due to the lack of metal rich stars in the empirical STELIB\nlibrary, or code improvement of the Vazdekis model. 2) When applying the\nVazdekis/MILES model for spectral fitting, the IMF variation will lead to not\nonly a systematic offset in $M_*/L_r$, but also offsets in age and metallicity,\nand these offsets increase with increasing stellar population ages.

In contrast to\nrepresenting domain characteristics using different generators or domain codes,\nwe pre-train a classification network to explicitly classify the domain of an\nimage. After pre-training, this network is used to extract the domain-specific\nfeatures of each image. Such features, together with the domain-independent\nfeatures extracted by another encoder (shared across different domains), are\nused to generate image in target domain.

Therefore, they are very appropriate for predicting \"big\nlosses\", but after a right characterization of the distributional type of \"the\npayoff\". When analyzing the tail of the observed distribution we need some\ncharacteristic which does not depend on the moments because in the most\nimportant cases of the heavy-tailed distributions theoretical moments do not\nexist and the corresponding empirical moments fluctuate too much.

High-precision pulsar-timing experiments are affected by temporal\nvariations of the Dispersion Measure (DM), which are related to spatial\nvariations in the interstellar electron content. Correcting for DM variations\nrelies on the cold-plasma dispersion law which states that the dispersive delay\nvaries with the squared inverse of the observing frequency. This may however\ngive incorrect measurements if the probed electron content (and therefore the\nDM) varies with observing frequency, as is predicted theoretically.\n  Aims. We study small-scale density variations in the ionised interstellar\nmedium. These structures may lead to frequency-dependent DMs in pulsar signals\nand could inhibit the use of lower-frequency pulsar observations to correct\ntime-variable interstellar dispersion in higher-frequency pulsar-timing data.\n  Methods.

In this paper, we address the task of\ndetecting two types of human rights abuses in challenging, everyday photos: (1)\nchild labour, and (2) displaced populations. We propose a novel model that is\ndriven by a human-centric approach. Our hypothesis is that the emotional state\nof a person -- how positive or pleasant an emotion is, and the control level of\nthe situation by the person -- are powerful cues for perceiving potential human\nrights violations. To exploit these cues, our model learns to predict global\nemotional traits over a given image based on the joint analysis of every\ndetected person and the whole scene. By integrating these predictions with a\ndata-driven convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier, our system\nefficiently infers potential human rights abuses in a clean, end-to-end system\nwe call GET-AID (from Global Emotional Traits for Abuse IDentification).\nExtensive experiments are performed to verify our method on the recently\nintroduced subset of Human Rights Archive (HRA) dataset (2 violation categories\nwith the same number of positive and negative samples), where we show\nquantitatively compelling results. Compared with previous works and the sole\nuse of a CNN classifier, this paper improves the coverage up to 23.73% for\nchild labour and 57.21% for displaced populations.

Despite the significant work under way to\nproduce these parameters for many ions, uncertainties in these parameters\nremain large and can limit the accuracy of chemical abundance determinations.\nThe Belgian repository of fundamental atomic data and stellar spectra (BRASS)\naims to provide a large systematic and homogeneous quality assessment of the\natomic data available for quantitative spectroscopy. BRASS shall compare\nsynthetic spectra against extremely high quality observed spectra, at a\nresolution of ~85000 and signal-noise ratios of ~1000, for around 20 bright\nBAFGK spectral type stars, in order to evaluate the atomic data available for\nover a thousand potentially useful spectral lines. A large-scale homogeneous\nselection of atomic lines is performed by synthesising theoretical spectra of\nliterature atomic lines, for FGK-type stars including the Sun, resulting in a\nselection of 1091 theoretically deep and unblended lines, in the wavelength\nrange 4200-6800~\\AA, which may be suitable for quality assessment.\nAstrophysical log(gf) values are determined for the 1091 transitions using two\ncommonly employed methods. The agreement of these log(gf) values are used to\nselect well-behaving lines for quality assessment. 845 atomic lines were found\nto be suitable for quality assessment, of which 408 were found to be robust\nagainst systematic differences between analysis methods. Around 54% of the\nquality-assessed lines were found to have at least one literature log(gf) value\nin agreement with our derived values, though the remaining values can disagree\nby as much as 0.5 dex.

The high-resolution spectra show FeXVII\nemission in many clusters, which implies the existence of cooling flows. The\ncooling rates are measured between the bulk Intracluster Medium (ICM)\ntemperature and 0.01 keV and are typically weak, operating at less than a few\ntens of $\\rm M_{\\odot}\\rm yr^{-1}$ in clusters, and less than 1 $\\rm\nM_{\\odot}\\rm yr^{-1}$ in groups of galaxies. They are 10-30% of the classical\ncooling rates in the absence of heating, which suggests that AGN feedback has a\nhigh level of efficiency. If cooling flows terminate at 0.7 keV in clusters,\nthe associated cooling rates are higher, and have a typical value of a few to a\nfew tens of $\\rm M_{\\odot}\\rm yr^{-1}$. Since the soft X-ray emitting region,\nwhere the temperature $kT<1$ keV, is spatially associated with H$\\alpha$\nnebulosity, we examine the relation between the cooling rates above 0.7 keV and\nthe H$\\alpha$ nebulae.

In 4 high luminosity\nclusters, the cooling rates above 0.7 keV are not sufficient and an inflow at a\nhigher temperature is required. Further residual cooling below 0.7 keV\nindicates very low complete cooling rates in most clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 11:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

In the so-called naive learning setting, a crowd of\nindividuals holds opinions that are statistically independent estimates of an\nunknown parameter; the crowd is wise when the average opinion converges to the\ntrue parameter in the limit of infinitely many individuals. Unfortunately, even\nstarting from wise initial opinions, a crowd subject to certain influence\nsystems may lose its wisdom. It is of great interest to characterize when an\ninfluence system preserves the crowd wisdom effect. In this paper we introduce\nand characterize numerous wisdom preservation properties of the basic\nFrench-DeGroot influence system model. Instead of requiring complete\nconvergence to consensus as in the previous naive learning model by Golub and\nJackson, we study finite-time executions of the French-DeGroot influence\nprocess and establish in this novel context the notion of prominent families\n(as a group of individuals with outsize influence).

Being less sensitive to dust extinction, the mid-infrared\nfine-structure lines of [NeII] 12.81 micron and [NeIII] 15.56 micron\neffectively trace the SFR in star-forming galaxies. These lines also have the\npotential to serve as a reliable SFR indicator in active galaxies, provided\nthat their contribution from the AGN narrow-line region can be removed. We use\na new set of photoionization calculations with realistic AGN spectral energy\ndistributions and input assumptions to constrain the magnitude of [NeII] and\n[NeIII] produced by the narrow-line region for a given strength of [NeV] 14.32\nmicron. We demonstrate that AGNs emit a relatively restricted range of\n[NeII]/[NeV] and [NeIII]/[NeV] ratios. Hence, once [NeV] is measured, the AGN\ncontribution to the low-ionization Ne lines can be estimated, and the SFR can\nbe determined from the strength of [NeII] and [NeIII]. We find that AGN host\ngalaxies have similar properties as compact extragalactic HII regions, which\nindicates that the star formation in AGN hosts is spatially concentrated. This\nsuggests a close relationship between black hole accretion and nuclear star\nformation. We update the calibration of [NeII] and [NeIII] strength as a SFR\nindicator, explicitly considering the effects of metallicity, finding very good\nrelations between Ne fractional abundances and the [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio for\ndifferent metallicities, ionization parameters, and starburst ages.

By employing the dimensionality reduction concept using\nthe more recently demonstrated autoencoder technique, we redefine the\nconventional many-to-one design problem in EM nanostructures into a one-to-one\nproblem plus a much simpler many-to-one problem, which can be simply solved\nusing an analytic formulation.

This effect originates from the\nincreasing geometrical distance of the observed shower to the telescope with\nincreasing zenith distance. This paper investigates how this alters the\nobserved image and how this affects the trigger rate as a function of zenith\nangle. The discussed effects include the change of Cherenkov light yield, of\nabsorption in the atmosphere, of photon density at the aperture and of the\nimage size at the focal plane of the telescope. Based on a simple model for the\natmosphere and well-known first principles on the development of extensive\nair-showers, the zenith angle dependence is expressed analytically. The\nassumption that most light is emitted from the shower core and mathematical\napproximations allow to derive an analytical expression describing the zenith\nangle dependence well with only three free parameters which are directly linked\nwith the underlying physics. This suggests further investigations about how\nthese fit parameters are linked to the properties of the atmosphere and the\ninstrument. Using data published by the First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope, a good\nmatch of the fit functions with the data is obtained. For the trigger rate of\ncosmic rays, the obtained parameters are consistent with the naive expectation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 13:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-12"}

Recently, deep learning-based\nhashing algorithms have been proposed as a promising paradigm to enable data\ndependent schemes. Often their efficacy is only demonstrated on data sets with\nfixed, limited numbers of classes. In practical scenarios, those labels are not\nalways available or one requires a method that can handle a higher input\nvariability, as well as a higher granularity. To fulfil those requirements, we\nlook at more flexible similarity measures. In this work, we present a novel,\nflexible, end-to-end trainable network for large-scale data hashing. Our method\nworks by transforming the data distribution to behave as a uniform distribution\non a product of spheres. The transformed data is subsequently hashed to a\nbinary form in a way that maximises entropy of the output, (i.e. to fully\nutilise the available bit-rate capacity) while maintaining the correctness\n(i.e. close items hash to the same key in the map). We show that the method\noutperforms baseline approaches such as locality-sensitive hashing and product\nquantisation in the limited capacity regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 13:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

A critical issue for all hollow cathode\nlamps (HCL) is the current at which the lamp is operated - a low value has the\nadvantage that the life time of the lamp is longer whereas the number of useful\nlines is lower. We investigate the number of suitable spectral lines depending\non the current used and obtained spectra of a ThNe HCL coupled by a fibre to\nthe Tautenburg Echelle spectrograph in a setting that is typical for many\nhigh-resolution spectrographs. Operating currents were chosen in the range\nspecified by the manufacturer. We varied exposure time to identify the\nsaturation level and effects of noise. A few thousands of Th lines were\nidentified automatically in the wavelength range considered. We noticed a\nscatter of several hundred ms$^{-1}$ of Th lines when varying the settings but\ndid not detect any systematic trends. The scatter in wavelength residuals of Th\nlines however indicates that a precise control of operating current can be\nnecessary. An estimation of the calibration precision of individual lines\nindicates that a combination of strong Th lines allows one to reach a level of\n1$\\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$. Although a high operating current reduces the life-time of\nthe lamp and accelerates its ageing it guarantees highest precision because of\nthe numerous Th lines which become strong compared to the Ne lines. Then,\nnoise, saturation, wavelength residuals of lines identified, and the pollution\ndue to saturated Ne lines can be minimised by adjusting exposure time. Our\nresults indicate that ThNe lamps can be better suited than ThAr lamps for all\nkinds of studies that involve the precise measurement of radial velocity\nvariations, e.g. studies on late-type stars, brown dwarfs, objects that suffer\nfrom strong extinction, or high-redshift galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 13:55:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

The effectiveness of vitrivr is shown\non the basis of a user study that involves different query and media types. To\nthe best of our knowledge, the full vitrivr stack is unique in that it is the\nfirst multimedia retrieval system that seamlessly integrates support for four\ndifferent types of media.

The first effect explains why the cold\nneutral gas in dwarf galaxies forms stars inefficiently. The second maintains\nthe hot ISM of massive galaxies (HII vents out at lower masses). At $v_{\\rm\nvir}\\simeq 67{\\rm\\,km\\,s}^{-1}$, the outflow rate follows the relation:\n$\\dot{M}_{\\rm out}=23\\,(v_{\\rm vir}/67{\\rm\\,km\\,s}^{-1})^{-4.6}\\,{\\rm SFR}$.\n$20\\%$ to $70\\%$ of the gas expelled from galaxies escapes from the halo\n(ejective feedback) but outflows are dominated by cold swept-up gas, most of\nwhich falls back onto the galaxy on a $\\sim 1\\,$Gyr timescale.

Our studies provide\nan explicit route to control the degree of shock fluctuations in periodic\nsystems, and should be relevant in cell biological transport where the\navailability of molecular motors is the rate limiting constraint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 14:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-06"}

The standard model of particle physics contains both coupling\nconstants and particle masses, and the allowed ranges of these parameters are\ndiscussed first. We then consider cosmological parameters, including the total\nenergy density, the vacuum energy density, the baryon-to-photon ratio, the dark\nmatter contribution, and the amplitude of primordial density fluctuations.\nThese quantities are constrained by the requirements that the universe lives\nfor a long time, emerges from the BBN epoch with an acceptable chemical\ncomposition, and can successfully produce galaxies.

Increase in\ncapacitance as a streamer branch propagates reduces its potential, while\nconduction through the streamer channel increases its potential, as a function\nof the time constant of the RC-system.

In practice, obtaining a large number of\nannotations from clinical experts is expensive and time-consuming. One way to\naddress scarcity of annotated examples is data augmentation using random\nspatial and intensity transformations. Recently, it has been proposed to use\ngenerative models to synthesize realistic training examples, complementing the\nrandom augmentation. So far, these methods have yielded limited gains over the\nrandom augmentation. However, there is potential to improve the approach by (i)\nexplicitly modeling deformation fields (non-affine spatial transformation) and\nintensity transformations and (ii) leveraging unlabelled data during the\ngenerative process. With this motivation, we propose a novel task-driven data\naugmentation method where to synthesize new training examples, a generative\nnetwork explicitly models and applies deformation fields and additive intensity\nmasks on existing labelled data, modeling shape and intensity variations,\nrespectively. Crucially, the generative model is optimized to be conducive to\nthe task, in this case segmentation, and constrained to match the distribution\nof images observed from labelled and unlabelled samples. Furthermore, explicit\nmodeling of deformation fields allow synthesizing segmentation masks and images\nin exact correspondence by simply applying the generated transformation to an\ninput image and the corresponding annotation. Our experiments on cardiac\nmagnetic resonance images (MRI) showed that, for the task of segmentation in\nsmall training data scenarios, the proposed method substantially outperforms\nconventional augmentation techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 11:21:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 10:08:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-01"}

Proper chaining of network functions leads to\noptimal utilization of distributed resources. This has been a de-facto model in\nthe telecom industry with network functions deployed over underlying hardware.\nThough this model has served the telecom industry well so far, it has been\nadapted mostly to suit the static behavior of network services and service\ndemands due to the deployment of the services directly over physical resources.\nThis results in network ossification with larger delays to the end-users,\nespecially with the data-centric model in which the computational resources are\nmoving closer to end users.

Since cloud computing is gaining significant\ntraction and virtualized data centers are becoming popular as a cost-effective\ninfrastructure in the telecommunication industry, CRAN is being heralded as a\ncandidate technology to meet the expectations of radio access networks for 5G.\nIn CRANs, low energy base stations (BSs) are deployed over a small geographical\nlocation and are connected to a cloud via finite capacity backhaul links.\nBaseband processing unit (BBU) functions are implemented on the virtual\nmachines (VMs) in the cloud over commodity hardware. Such functions, built-in\nsoftware, are termed as virtual functions (VFs). The optimized placement of VFs\nis necessary to reduce the total delays and minimize the overall costs to\noperate CRANs. Our study considers the problem of optimal VF placement over\ndistributed virtual resources spread across multiple clouds, creating a\ncentralized BBU cloud. We propose a combinatorial optimization model and the\nuse of two heuristic approaches, which are, branch-and-bound (BnB) and\nsimulated annealing (SA) for the proposed optimal placement. In addition, we\npropose enhancements to the standard BnB heuristic and compare the results with\nstandard BnB and SA approaches. The proposed enhancements improve the quality\nof the solution in terms of latency and cost as well as reduce the execution\ncomplexity significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2019 23:43:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-29"}

Development of IoT as well as 5G networks and explosion in\nonline services has resulted in an exponential growth of devices connected to\nthe network. As a result, application service providers (ASPs) and Internet\nservice providers (ISPs) are being confronted with the unprecedented challenge\nof accommodating increasing service and traffic demands from the geographically\ndistributed users. To tackle this problem, many ASPs and ISPs, such as Netflix,\nFacebook, AT&T and others are increasingly adopting micro-services (MS)\napplication architecture. Despite the success of MS in the industry, there is\nno specific standard or research work for service providers as guidelines,\nespecially from the perspective of basic micro-service operations. In this\nwork, we aim to bridge this gap between industry and academia and discuss\ndifferent micro-service deployment, discovery and communication options for\nservice providers as a means to forming complete service chains. In addition,\nwe address the problem of scheduling micro-services across multiple clouds,\nincluding micro-clouds. We consider different user-level SLAs, such as latency\nand cost, while scheduling such services. We aim to reduce overall turnaround\ntime as well as costs for the deployment of complete end-to-end service. In\nthis work, we present a novel affinity-based fair weighted scheduling heuristic\nto solve this problem. We also compare the results of proposed solution with\nstandard greedy scheduling algorithms presented in the literature and observe\nsignificant improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2019 23:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-01"}

The testbed\nconsists of a water storage tank's control system, which is a stage in the\nprocess of water treatment and distribution. Sophisticated cyber-attacks were\nconducted against the testbed. During the attacks, the network traffic was\ncaptured, and features were extracted from the traffic to build a dataset for\ntraining and testing different machine learning algorithms. Five traditional\nmachine learning algorithms were trained to detect the attacks: Random Forest,\nDecision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and KNN. Then, the trained\nmachine learning models were built and deployed in the network, where new tests\nwere made using online network traffic. The performance obtained during the\ntraining and testing of the machine learning models was compared to the\nperformance obtained during the online deployment of these models in the\nnetwork. The results show the efficiency of the machine learning models in\ndetecting the attacks in real time.
