This\nproblem is of fundamental importance and is known to have a broad range of\napplications in various fields. It is well known that, there is no FPTAS for\nthe $d$-dimensional knapsack problem when $d\\geq 2$, unless P $=$ NP.

In two of the three spike onset bifurcation sequences\nthat are known to give rise to all-or-none type action potentials, however, the\nresting-state fixpoint and limit cycle spiking can coexist in an intermediate\nregime, resulting in bistable dynamics. Here, noise can induce switches between\nthe attractors, i.e., between rest and spiking, and thus increase the\nvariability of the spike train compared to neurons with only one stable\nattractor.

The main improvements were done: 1) for the\nperiodogram analysis - the parameters are determined from a complete set of\nequations containing the (algebraic polynomial) trend superimposed on the\n(multi-) harmonic wave, so no \"detrending\", no \"prewhitening\" are used; 2) for\nthe approximations - we use additional (multi-) harmonic waves, and also\n\"special shapes\" (patterns) for parts of the light curve, which correspond to\nrelatively fast changes (minima of the eclipsing binaries, minima and maxima\nfor the pulsating variables); 3) \"auto correlation analysis\" (ACF) - taking\ninto account the bias due to a trend removal (previously - only a subtraction\nof the sample mean was taken into account); ACF for the irregularly spaced\ndata; 4) for the signals with bad coherence, the \"scalegram\" analysis is\nproposed, which allows to estimate a characteristic cycle length and the\namplitude, as well as to provide a realistic approximation; 5) the extension of\nthe Morlet-type wavelet for more periodic signals and 6) \"running\" (parabola,\nsine) approximations for aperiodic and \"nearly periodic\" variations,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Feb 2019 20:16:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

The impressive, yet elusive empirical\nperformance of GANs has lead to the rise of many GAN-VAE hybrids, with the\nhopes of GAN level performance and additional benefits of VAE, such as an\nencoder for feature reduction, which is not offered by GANs. Recently, the\nWasserstein Autoencoder (WAE) was proposed, achieving performance similar to\nthat of GANs, yet it is still unclear whether the two are fundamentally\ndifferent or can be further improved into a unified model. In this work, we\nstudy the $f$-GAN and WAE models and make two main discoveries. First, we find\nthat the $f$-GAN and WAE objectives partake in a primal-dual relationship and\nare equivalent under some assumptions, which then allows us to explicate the\nsuccess of WAE. Second, the equivalence result allows us to, for the first\ntime, prove generalization bounds for Autoencoder models, which is a pertinent\nproblem when it comes to theoretical analyses of generative models.\nFurthermore, we show that the WAE objective is related to other statistical\nquantities such as the $f$-divergence and in particular, upper bounded by the\nWasserstein distance, which then allows us to tap into existing efficient\n(regularized) optimal transport solvers. Our findings thus present the first\nprimal-dual relationship between GANs and Autoencoder models, comment on\ngeneralization abilities and make a step towards unifying these models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Feb 2019 22:56:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 08:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-29"}

A classical\napproach in statistics is to assume the responses are linear, plus zero-mean\ni.i.d. Gaussian noise, in which case the goal is to provide an unbiased\nestimator with smallest mean squared error (A-optimal design). A related\napproach, more common in computer science, is to assume the responses are\narbitrary but fixed, in which case the goal is to estimate the least squares\nsolution using few responses, as quickly as possible, for worst-case inputs.\nDespite many attempts, characterizing the relationship between these two\napproaches has proven elusive.

Moreover, the extent to which our Galaxy's\nstellar and gas disk morphologies are mutually consistent is also unclear.\nClassical Cepheids, primary distance indicators with distance accuracies of\n3-5%, offer a unique opportunity to develop an intuitive and accurate\nthree-dimensional picture. Here, we establish a robust Galactic disk model\nbased on 1339 classical Cepheids. We provide strong evidence that the warp's\nline of nodes is not oriented in the Galactic Center-Sun direction. Instead, it\nsubtends a mean angle of 17.5 \\pm 1 (formal) \\pm 3 (systematic) and exhibits a\nleading spiral pattern. Our Galaxy thus follows Briggs' rule for spiral\ngalaxies, which suggests that the origin of the warp is associated with torques\nforced by the massive inner disk. The stellar disk traced by Cepheids follows\nthe gas disk in terms of their amplitudes; the stellar disk extends to at least\n20 kpc. This morphology provides a crucial, updated map for studies of the\nkinematics and archaeology of the Galactic disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 00:34:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

A prototypical\nexample of such redundancy is a freerider pattern where the pattern contains a\ntrue pattern and some additional noise events. A technique for filtering\nfreerider patterns that has proved to be efficient in ranking itemsets is to\nuse a partition model where a pattern is divided into two subpatterns and the\nobserved support is compared to the expected support under the assumption that\nthese two subpatterns occur independently.\n  In this paper we develop a partition model for episodes, patterns discovered\nfrom sequential data. An episode is essentially a set of events, with possible\nrestrictions on the order of events. Unlike with itemset mining, computing the\nexpected support of an episode requires surprisingly sophisticated methods. In\norder to construct the model, we partition the episode into two subepisodes. We\nthen model how likely the events in each subepisode occur close to each other.\nIf this probability is high---which is often the case if the subepisode has a\nhigh support---then we can expect that when one event from a subepisode occurs,\nthen the remaining events occur also close by. This approach increases the\nexpected support of the episode, and if this increase explains the observed\nsupport, then we can deem the episode uninteresting. We demonstrate in our\nexperiments that using the partition model can effectively and efficiently\nreduce the redundancy in episodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 01:30:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

When Hall diffusion time\nis long (compared to the time over which waves are sheared), the growth rate of\nthe instability in the presence of sub Alfvenic flow increases with the charge\nnumber Z on the grain, while it is quenched in the presence of Alfvenic or\nsuper Alfvenic flows. However, when Hall diffusion is fast, the growth rate of\nthe instability depends on the dust charge only indirectly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 05:17:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

Motivated by them, we proposed an end-to-end feature fusion\nframework based on Siamese network, named FF-Siam, which can effectively fuse\ndifferent features for adaptive visual tracking. The framework consists of four\nlayers. A feature extraction layer is designed to extract the different\nfeatures of the target region and search region. The extracted features are\nthen put into a weight generation layer to obtain the channel weights, which\nindicate the importance of different feature channels. Both features and the\nchannel weights are utilized in a template generation layer to generate a\ndiscriminative template. Finally, the corresponding response maps created by\nthe convolution of the search region features and the template are applied with\na fusion layer to obtain the final response map for locating the target.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the popular Temple-Color, OTB50 and UAV123\nbenchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 07:28:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

The impact is assessed using a queuing theoretic equilibrium\nmodel which incorporates the stochastic dynamics of the app-based ride-hailing\nmatching platform, the ride prices and driver wages established by the\nplatform, and the incentives of passengers and drivers. We show that a floor\nplaced under driver earnings pushes the ride-hailing platform to hire more\ndrivers and offer more rides, at the same time that passengers enjoy faster\nrides and lower total cost, while platform rents are reduced. Contrary to\nstandard economic theory, enforcing a minimum wage for drivers benefits both\ndrivers and passengers, and promotes the efficiency of the entire system. This\nsurprising outcome holds for almost all model parameters, and it occurs because\nthe wage floors curbs TNC labor market power.

This is in sharp contrast with\ngeneral NFAs. (ii) We describe a quadratic algorithm to prefix-sort a proper\nsuperset of the WDFAs, a $O(n\\log n)$-time online algorithm to sort acyclic\nWDFAs, and an optimal linear-time offline algorithm to sort general WDFAs. By\ncontribution (i), our algorithms can also be used to index any WNFA at the\nmoderate price of doubling the automaton's size. (iii) We provide a\nminimization theorem that characterizes the smallest WDFA recognizing the same\nlanguage of any input WDFA. The corresponding constructive algorithm runs in\noptimal linear time in the acyclic case, and in $O(n\\log n)$ time in the\ngeneral case. (iv) We show how to compute the smallest WDFA equivalent to any\nacyclic DFA in nearly-optimal time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 09:00:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 08:21:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 15:06:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 2019 07:53:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

The Sun is an active star and the source of the largest explosions\nin the solar system, such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Flares\nand CMEs are powerful particle accelerators that can generate radio emission\nthrough various emission mechanisms. Aims. CMEs are often accompanied by Type\nIV radio bursts that are observed as continuum emission in dynamic spectra at\ndecimetric and metric wavelengths, but their emission mechanism can vary from\nevent to event. Here, we aim to determine the emission mechanism of a complex\nType IV burst that accompanied the flare and CME on 22 September 2011. Methods.\nWe used radio imaging from the Nan\\c{c}ay Radioheliograph, spectroscopic data\nfrom the e-Callisto network, ARTEMIS, Ondrejov, and Phoenix3 spectrometers\ncombined with extreme-ultraviolet observations from NASA's Solar Dynamic\nObservatory to analyse the Type IV radio burst and determine its emission\nmechanism. Results. We show that the emission mechanism of the Type IV radio\nburst changes over time. We identified two components in the Type IV radio\nburst: an earlier stationary Type IV showing gyro-synchrotron behaviour, and a\nlater moving Type IV burst covering the same frequency band. This second\ncomponent has a coherent emission mechanism. Fundamental plasma emission and\nthe electroncyclotron maser emission are further investigated as possible\nemission mechanisms for the generation of the moving Type IV burst.\nConclusions. Type IV bursts are therefore complex radio bursts, where multiple\nemission mechanisms can contribute to the generation of the wide-band continuum\nobserved in dynamic spectra. Imaging spectroscopy over a wide frequency band is\nnecessary to determine the emission mechanisms of Type IV bursts that are\nobserved in dynamic spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 12:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

Such explorations on Riemannian manifolds, on the other\nhand, are relatively new, limited, and challenging. This is because of the\nintrinsic non-linear structure of the underlying manifold and the absence of a\ncanonical coordinate system. In machine learning applications, however, most\nmanifolds of interest are represented as matrices with notions of row and\ncolumn subspaces. In addition, the implicit manifold-related constraints may\nalso lie on such subspaces. For example, the Grassmann manifold is the set of\ncolumn subspaces. To this end, such a rich structure should not be lost by\ntransforming matrices to just a stack of vectors while developing optimization\nalgorithms on manifolds. We propose novel stochastic gradient algorithms for\nproblems on Riemannian matrix manifolds by adapting the row and column\nsubspaces of gradients.

Aims. We want to model the quiescent emission of Sgr A* from radio\nto mid-infrared by considering a magnetized compact torus and an extended jet.\nResults. We find perfect spectral fit both for face-on and edge-on views. These\nbest fits give parameters values very close to that found by the most recent\nnumerical simulations, which are much more complex than our model. The\nintrinsic radio size of Sgr A* is found to be in reasonable agreement with the\ncentimetric observed constraints. Our best-fit infrared spectral index is in\nperfect agreement with the latest constraints. Our emission region at 1.3 mm,\nalthough larger than the Doeleman et al.

In this paper, we\nconsider limitations imposed by the process of conversion of VHE gamma rays\ninto $e^{\\pm}$ pairs in the magnetic field of the pulsar magnetosphere. Photons\nwith energies exceeding 1~TeV are effectively absorbed even at large distances\nfrom the surface of the neutron star.

The gamma-ray absorption appears stronger for photons\nemitted in the direction of rotation than in the opposite direction. There is a\nsmall angular cone inside which the magnetosphere is relatively transparent and\nphotons with energy $1.5$~TeV can escape from distances beyond $0.1$~light\ncylinder radius ($R_{\\rm{lc}}$).

For head-on collisions of nanoparticles with\nradii $R =$ 1.4 nm, $R =$ 5.2 nm, and $R =$ 11 nm, sticking was observed at all\nsimulated velocities. The results were compared to the description provided by\nthe JKR model. It was found that strong disagreement exists between the\npredictions of JKR and the results of the molecular-dynamics simulation due to\nthe presence of additional dissipative processes which strengthen sticking\nbehavior. First, it is demonstrated that very strong dissipation into atomic\nvibrations occurs during the collision. The dissipation is strong enough to\nprevent significant rebound of the nanoparticles. Additionally, the morphology\nof the adhered nanoparticles includes a ``neck'' that increases in radius with\nincreasing collision velocity which results in amplified irreversibility and\nadhesion. Approximate calculation of the stress during the collision indicates\nthat stress levels are well above typical yield stress values even for low\nvelocity collisions, consistent with the observation of plastic deformation.\nFurthermore, it is shown that for nanoparticles with $R \\leq$ 11 nm, the\ndominance of surface attraction results in large effective collision velocities\nand plastic deformation.

Here, we therefore analyze the efficacy and\nefficiency of several state-of-the-art regression and feature selection\nmethods, in particular in the context of FC extraction and the prediction of\ndifferent thermodynamic properties. Generic feature selection algorithms such\nas recursive feature elimination with ordinary least-squares (OLS), automatic\nrelevance determination regression, and the adaptive least absolute shrinkage\nand selection operator can yield physically sound models for systems with a\nmodest number of degrees of freedom.

In such cases, OLS with cutoff selection provides a viable route\nas demonstrated here for both second-order FCs in large low-symmetry unit cells\nand high-order FCs in low-symmetry systems.

Here, the present work\nestablishes guidelines for the design of protocols that are readily usable,\ne.g., in high-throughput and materials discovery schemes.

In preparing the radar training data, the ground\ntruth of an object orientation in 3D space is provided by conducting image\nanalysis, of which the images are obtained through a coupled camera to the\nradar device. To ensure successful training of a fully convolutional network\n(FCN), we propose a normalization method, which is found to be essential to be\napplied to the radar signal before feeding into the neural network. The system\nafter proper training is able to first detect the presence of an object in an\nenvironment. If it does, the system then further produces an estimation of its\n3D position. Experimental results show that the proposed system can be\nsuccessfully trained and employed for detecting a car and further estimating\nits 3D position in a noisy environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 10:56:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-15"}

Despite significant advances, most current\nstate-of-the-art algorithms are regular-grid region based; when attention is\nused, it is mainly applied between individual regular-grid regions and a word.\nThese approaches are sufficient to generate images that contain a single object\nin its foreground, such as a \"bird\" or \"flower\". However, natural languages\noften involve complex foreground objects and the background may also constitute\na variable portion of the generated image. Therefore, the regular-grid based\nimage attention weights may not necessarily concentrate on the intended\nforeground region(s), which in turn, results in an unnatural looking image.\nAdditionally, individual words such as \"a\", \"blue\" and \"shirt\" do not\nnecessarily provide a full visual context unless they are applied together. For\nthis reason, in our paper, we proposed a novel method in which we introduced an\nadditional set of attentions between true-grid regions and word phrases. The\ntrue-grid region is derived using a set of auxiliary bounding boxes. These\nauxiliary bounding boxes serve as superior location indicators to where the\nalignment and attention should be drawn with the word phrases. Word phrases are\nderived from analysing Part-of-Speech (POS) results. We perform experiments on\nthis novel network architecture using the Microsoft Common Objects in Context\n(MSCOCO) dataset and the model generates $256 \\times 256$ conditioned on a\nshort sentence description. Our proposed approach is capable of generating more\nrealistic images compared with the current state-of-the-art algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 11:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-15"}

Thus far, however,\nthe understanding of its fluid dynamics has only been applied to single\nmaterial preforms for which higher order effects, such as the radial dependency\nof the axial velocity, could be neglected. With complex multimaterial preforms,\nsuch effects must be taken into account, as they can affect the architecture\nand the functional properties of the resulting fiber device. Here, we propose a\nversatile model of the thermal drawing of fibers, which takes into account a\nradially varying axial velocity. Unlike the commonly used cross section\naveraged approach, our model is capable of predicting radial variations of\nfunctional properties caused by the deformation during drawing. This is\ndemonstrated for two effects observed, namely, by unraveling the deformation of\ninitially straight, transversal lines in the preform and the dependence on the\ndraw ratio and radial position of the in-fiber electrical conductivity of\npolymer nanocomposites, an important class of materials for emerging fiber\ndevices.
