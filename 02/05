However, previous studies of SC noise typically treat only\nthe quantum noise, typically in the form of one-photon-per-mode noise, and do\nnot consider other technical noise contributions, such as the stability of the\npump laser, which become important when the broadening mechanism itself is\ncoherent. In this work, we discuss the influence of the amplitude and pulse\nlength noise of the pump laser, both added separately and combined. We show\nthat for a typical mode-locked laser, in which the peak power and pulse\nduration are anticorrelated, their combined impact on the SC noise is generally\nsmaller than in isolation. This means that the supercontinuum noise is smaller\nthan the noise of the mode-locked pump laser itself, a fact that was recently\nobserved in experiments but not explained. Our detailed numerical analysis\nshows that the coherence of ANDi SC generation is considerably reduced on the\nspectral edges when realistic pump laser noise levels are taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 16:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Over the past decades, several interplanetary missions have studied\nsmall bodies in situ, leading to major advances in our understanding of their\ngeological and geophysical properties. These missions, however, have had a\nlimited number of targets. Among them, the NASA Dawn mission has characterised\nin detail the topography and albedo variegation across the surface of asteroid\n(4) Vesta down to a spatial resolution of approximately 20 m/pixel scale.\n  Aims. Here our aim was to determine how much topographic and albedo\ninformation can be retrieved from the ground with VLT/SPHERE in the case of\nVesta, having a former space mission (Dawn) providing us with the ground truth\nthat can be used as a benchmark.\n  Methods. We observed Vesta with VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL as part of our ESO large\nprogramme (ID 199.C-0074) at six different epochs, and deconvolved the\ncollected images with a parametric point spread function (PSF). We then\ncompared our images with synthetic views of Vesta generated from the 3D shape\nmodel of the Dawn mission, on which we projected Vesta's albedo information.\n  Results. We show that the deconvolution of the VLT/SPHERE images with a\nparametric PSF allows the retrieval of the main topographic and albedo features\npresent across the surface of Vesta down to a spatial resolution of\napproximately 20-30 km. Contour extraction shows an accuracy of approximately 1\npixel (3.6 mas). The present study provides the very first quantitative\nestimate of the accuracy of ground-based adaptive-optics imaging observations\nof asteroid surfaces.\n  Conclusions. In the case of Vesta, the upcoming generation of 30-40m\ntelescopes (ELT, TMT, GMT) should in principle be able to resolve all of the\nmain features present across its surface, including the troughs and the\nnorth-south crater dichotomy, provided that they operate at the diffraction\nlimit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 16:25:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

Few-shot\nlearning aims to address this shortcoming by learning a new class from a few\nannotated support examples. We introduce, a novel few-shot framework, for the\nsegmentation of volumetric medical images with only a few annotated slices.\nCompared to other related works in computer vision, the major challenges are\nthe absence of pre-trained networks and the volumetric nature of medical scans.\nWe address these challenges by proposing a new architecture for few-shot\nsegmentation that incorporates 'squeeze & excite' blocks. Our two-armed\narchitecture consists of a conditioner arm, which processes the annotated\nsupport input and generates a task-specific representation. This representation\nis passed on to the segmenter arm that uses this information to segment the new\nquery image. To facilitate efficient interaction between the conditioner and\nthe segmenter arm, we propose to use 'channel squeeze & spatial excitation'\nblocks - a light-weight computational module - that enables heavy interaction\nbetween both the arms with negligible increase in model complexity. This\ncontribution allows us to perform image segmentation without relying on a\npre-trained model, which generally is unavailable for medical scans.\nFurthermore, we propose an efficient strategy for volumetric segmentation by\noptimally pairing a few slices of the support volume to all the slices of the\nquery volume. We perform experiments for organ segmentation on whole-body\ncontrast-enhanced CT scans from the Visceral Dataset. Our proposed model\noutperforms multiple baselines and existing approaches with respect to the\nsegmentation accuracy by a significant margin.

Such astonishing diversity in observed\nsmall exoplanet compositions may be the product of different initial conditions\nof the planet-formation process and/or different evolutionary paths that\naltered the planetary properties after formation. Planet evolution may be\nespecially affected by either photoevaporative mass loss induced by high\nstellar X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) flux or giant impacts. Although\nthere is some evidence for the former, there are no unambiguous findings so far\nabout the occurrence of giant impacts in an exoplanet system. Here, we\ncharacterize the two innermost planets of the compact and near-resonant system\nKepler-107. We show that they have nearly identical radii (about\n$1.5-1.6~R_\\oplus$), but the outer planet Kepler-107c is more than twice as\ndense (about $12.6~\\rm g\\,cm^{-3}$) as the innermost Kepler-107b (about\n$5.3~\\rm g\\,cm^{-3}$). In consequence, Kepler-107c must have a larger iron core\nfraction than Kepler-107b. This imbalance cannot be explained by the stellar\nXUV irradiation, which would conversely make the more-irradiated and\nless-massive planet Kepler-107b denser than Kepler-107c. Instead, the\ndissimilar densities are consistent with a giant impact event on Kepler-107c\nthat would have stripped off part of its silicate mantle. This hypothesis is\nsupported by theoretical predictions from collisional mantle stripping, which\nmatch the mass and radius of Kepler-107c.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 17:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

The latter allows users to bid for the remaining unoccupied periods\nvia dynamic pricing; however, without appropriate design, such periods may be\narbitrarily small since on-demand users arrive randomly.

Jam-absorption driving\n(JAD) is a single vehicle's maneuvers to remove a wide moving jam and consists\nof two actions. First, a vehicle upstream of the jam slows down and maintains a\nlow velocity. Because it cuts off the supply of vehicles to the jam, the jam\nshrinks and finally disappears. Second, it returns to following the vehicle\nahead of it. One of the critical problems of JAD is the occurrence of secondary\njams. The perturbations caused by JAD actions may grow into secondary jams due\nto the instability of traffic flows. The occurrence of secondary jams was\ninvestigated by numerical simulations in non-periodic systems where only\nhuman-driven vehicles are placed upstream of the vehicle performing JAD.\nHowever, no theoretical condition has been proposed to restrict secondary jams\nin these systems. This paper presents a theoretical condition restricting\nsecondary jams in a semi-infinite system composed of a vehicle performing JAD\nand the other human-driven vehicles obeying a car-following model on a\nnon-periodic and single-lane road. In constructing this condition, we apply the\nlinear string stability to a macroscopic spatiotemporal structure of JAD.\nNumerical simulations show that a finite version of this condition restricts\nsecondary jams. Moreover, under this condition, we demonstrate that it is\npossible to restrict secondary jams in the semi-infinite system under wide\nranges of the parameters of the system. Furthermore, we construct the\nconditions suppressing secondary jams in other semi-infinite systems with\ninflows from other lanes or a bottleneck, and demonstrate that JAD can restrict\nsecondary jams in these systems. Thus, our method theoretically guarantees that\na single vehicle can improve macroscopic traffic flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 17:49:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 08:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

They exhibit mass-loss\nvariations and experience different types of oscillation modes, and there is\ngrowing evidence that variable stellar winds and photospheric pulsations are\nclosely related. To discuss the wind properties and variability of evolved\nB-type stars, we derive new stellar and wind parameters for a sample of 19\nGalactic BSGs by fitting theoretical line profiles of H, He, and Si to the\nobserved ones and compare them with previous determinations. The mass-loss rate\nof three stars has been obtained for the first time. All stars follow the known\nempirical wind momentum-luminosity relationships, and the late BSGs show the\ntrend of the mid BSGs. We find an empirical relationship that associates the\namplitude of mass-loss variations with photometric/spectroscopic variability on\ntimescales of tens of days. We find that stars located on the cool side of the\nbi-stability jump show a decrease in the terminal and escape velocities ratio,\nwhile their corresponding mass-loss rates are similar to or lower than the\nvalues found for stars on the hot side. Particularly, for those variable stars\na decrease in the terminal and escape velocities ratio is accompanied by a\ndecrease in the mass-loss rate. Our results also suggest that radial pulsation\nmodes with periods longer than 6 days might be responsible for the wind\nvariability in the mid/late-type BSGs. These radial modes might be identified\nwith strange modes, which are known to facilitate (enhanced) mass loss. On the\nother hand, we propose that the wind behaviour of stars on the cool side of the\nbi-stability jump could fit with predictions of the delta-slow hydrodynamics\nsolution for radiation-driven winds with highly variable ionization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 18:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

We work under the black-box setting: we assume no prior\nknowledge of the system's internals, and we run the system for choices of\nsecrets and measure its leakage from the respective outputs. Our goal is to\nestimate the Bayes risk, from which one can derive some of the most popular\nleakage measures (e.g., min-entropy, additive, and multiplicative leakage). The\nstate-of-the-art method for estimating these leakage measures is the\nfrequentist paradigm, which approximates the system's internals by looking at\nthe frequencies of its inputs and outputs. Unfortunately, this does not scale\nfor systems with large output spaces, where it would require too many\ninput-output examples. Consequently, it also cannot be applied to systems with\ncontinuous outputs (e.g., time side channels, network traffic). In this paper,\nwe exploit an analogy between Machine Learning (ML) and black-box leakage\nestimation to show that the Bayes risk of a system can be estimated by using a\nclass of ML methods: the universally consistent learning rules; these rules can\nexploit patterns in the input-output examples to improve the estimates'\nconvergence, while retaining formal optimality guarantees.

To elucidate the role of trap states which\naffect the free carrier lifetimes, we fabricate MAFA perovskite thin films with\nthree different thicknesses. By measuring the change in the photoluminescence\nproperties under different excitation fluences, we find that the prevalent\nrecombination mechanism shifts from monomolecular for thinner films to\nbimolecular recombination for thicker MAFA films, indicating a reduction in\nshallow trap-assisted recombination.

We observe that\nthe threshold for efficient triplet-triplet annihilation shifts to lower\nincident powers with increasing MAFA thickness, which suggests that the charge\ntransfer to the triplet state competes with non-radiative trap filling.

In this\nstudy, we focused on a sub-population of these jets that undergo parabolic\ntrajectories when observed in the He II 304 {\\AA} line using high-cadence\nobservations of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar\nDynamics Observatory (SDO) to accumulate a statistically significant sample,\nwhich included 330 such events.

Analyzing dMRI\nmeasures along the trajectory of white matter bundles can provide a more\nspecific investigation than considering a region of interest or tract-averaged\nmeasurements. However, performing group analyses with this along-tract strategy\nrequires correspondence between points of tract pathways across subjects. This\nis usually achieved by creating a new common space where the representative\nstreamlines from every subject are resampled to the same number of points. If\nthe underlying anatomy of some subjects was altered due to, e.g. disease or\ndevelopmental changes, such information might be lost by resampling to a fixed\nnumber of points. In this work, we propose to address the issue of possible\nmisalignment, which might be present even after resampling, by realigning the\nrepresentative streamline of each subject in this 1D space with a new method,\ncoined diffusion profile realignment (DPR). Experiments on synthetic datasets\nshow that DPR reduces the coefficient of variation for the mean diffusivity,\nfractional anisotropy and apparent fiber density when compared to the unaligned\ncase. Using 100 in vivo datasets from the HCP, we simulated changes in mean\ndiffusivity, fractional anisotropy and apparent fiber density. Pairwise\nStudent's t-tests between these altered subjects and the original subjects\nindicate that regional changes are identified after realignment with the DPR\nalgorithm, while preserving differences previously detected in the unaligned\ncase. This new correction strategy contributes to revealing effects of interest\nwhich might be hidden by misalignment and has the potential to improve the\nspecificity in longitudinal population studies beyond the traditional region of\ninterest based analysis and along-tract analysis workflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 17:45:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 15:17:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 10:24:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 08:47:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-21"}

The classic linear theory considers a discontinuity in density\nand velocity at the interface of two fluids. However, for numerical simulations\nof the KHI such initial conditions do not yield converged results even at the\nlinear stage of the instability. Instead, smooth profiles of velocity and\ndensity are required for convergence. This renders analytical theory to be only\napproximately valid and hinders quantitative comparisons between the classical\ntheory and simulations. In this paper we derive a linear theory for the KHI\nwith smooth profiles and illustrate code testing with the MHD code Athena. We\nprovide the linear solution for the KHI with smooth initial conditions in three\ndifferent limits: inviscid hydrodynamics, ideal MHD and Braginskii-MHD.

We describe here seven cases of this phenomenon for chemo-kinematical\nrelations believed to constrain the Milky Way disk formation and evolution. We\nshow that interpreting trends in relations, such as the radial and vertical\nchemical abundance gradients, the age-metallicity relation, and the\nmetallicity-rotational velocity relation (MVR), can lead to conflicting\nconclusions about the Galaxy past if analyses marginalize over stellar age\nand/or birth radius. It is demonstrated that the MVR in RAVE giants is\nconsistent with being always strongly negative, when narrow bins of [Mg/Fe] are\nconsidered. This is directly related to the negative radial metallicity\ngradients of stars grouped by common age (mono-age populations) due to the\ninside out disk formation. The effect of the asymmetric drift can then give\nrise to a positive MVR trend in high-[alpha/Fe] stars, with a slope dependent\non a given survey's selection function and observational uncertainties. We also\nstudy the variation of lithium abundance, A(Li), with [Fe/H] of AMBRE:HARPS\ndwarfs.

Achieving this\ntype of detection is a challenging problem due to the complex and weak\nsignatures of some faults, particularly the faults that occur in some of the\ndrivetrain bearings. Here, we investigate recently proposed condition\nmonitoring methods based on unsupervised dictionary learning using vibration\ndata recorded over 46 months under typical industrial operations.

In this study, dictionaries are learned from\ngearbox vibrations in six different turbines, and the dictionaries are\nsubsequently propagated over a few years of monitoring data when faults are\nknown to occur. We perform the experiment using two different sparse coding\nalgorithms to investigate if the algorithm selected affects the features of\nabnormal conditions.

An extensive literature exists on making causal inferences under the iid\nassumption [18, 12, 28, 22], even when unobserved confounding bias may be\npresent. But, as pointed out in [20], causal inference in non-iid contexts is\nchallenging due to the presence of both unobserved confounding and data\ndependence. In this paper we develop a general theory describing when causal\ninferences are possible in such scenarios. We use segregated graphs [21], a\ngeneralization of latent projection mixed graphs [30], to represent causal\nmodels of this type and provide a complete algorithm for non-parametric\nidentification in these models.

Choosing a cluster head can\nappropriately balance the load in the network thereby reducing energy\nconsumption and enhancing lifetime. The paper focuses on an efficient cluster\nhead election scheme that rotates the cluster head position among the nodes\nwith higher energy level as compared to other. The algorithm considers initial\nenergy, residual energy and an optimum value of cluster heads to elect the next\ngroup of cluster heads for the network that suits for IoT applications such as\nenvironmental monitoring, smart cities, and systems.

While reducing factoring to SAT has\nproved to be useful for studying SAT solvers, attempting to factor large\nintegers via such a reduction has not been found to be successful.\n  Shor's quantum factoring algorithm factors any integer in polynomial time,\nalthough large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers capable of implementing\nShor's algorithm are not yet available, so relevant benchmarking experiments\nfor factoring via Shor's algorithm are not yet possible. In recent years,\nhowever, several authors have attempted factorizations with the help of quantum\nprocessors via reductions to NP-hard problems.

An important\nconcern with SMM, which matches sample with simulated moments, is that a\nparametric distribution is required. However, economic quantities that depend\non this distribution, such as welfare and asset-prices, can be sensitive to\nmisspecification.

Existing quantum\nprogramming languages and compilers use a quantum assembly language composed of\n1- and 2-qubit (quantum bit) gates. Quantum compiler frameworks translate this\nquantum assembly to electric signals (called control pulses) that implement the\nspecified computation on specific physical devices. However, there is a\nmismatch between the operations defined by the 1- and 2-qubit logical ISA and\ntheir underlying physical implementation, so the current practice of directly\ntranslating logical instructions into control pulses results in inefficient,\nhigh-latency programs. To address this inefficiency, we propose a universal\nquantum compilation methodology that aggregates multiple logical operations\ninto larger units that manipulate up to 10 qubits at a time. Our methodology\nthen optimizes these aggregates by (1) finding commutative intermediate\noperations that result in more efficient schedules and (2) creating custom\ncontrol pulses optimized for the aggregate (instead of individual 1- and\n2-qubit operations). Compared to the standard gate-based compilation, the\nproposed approach realizes a deeper vertical integration of high-level quantum\nsoftware and low-level, physical quantum hardware.

Instead, vertices form a hierarchy such that the edges appear\nmainly from upper levels to lower levels. Discovering hierarchies from such\ngraphs is a challenging problem that has gained attention. Formally, given a\ndirected graph, we want to partition vertices into levels such that ideally\nthere are only edges from upper levels to lower levels. From computational\npoint of view, the ideal case is when the underlying directed graph is acyclic.\nIn such case, we can partition the vertices into a hierarchy such that there\nare only edges from upper levels to lower edges. In practice, graphs are rarely\nacyclic, hence we need to penalize the edges that violate the hierarchy. One\npractical approach is agony, where each violating edge is penalized based on\nthe severity of the violation. The fastest algorithm for computing agony\nrequires $O(nm^2)$ time. In the paper we present an algorithm for computing\nagony that has better theoretical bound, namely $O(m^2)$.

Despite the inherently\nnumerical nature of Gaussian correlations we construct a method that is\napplicable to both numerical and categorical attributes alike. Our mechanism is\nefficient in that it only takes time proportional to the square of the number\nof attributes in the dataset. We propose a differentially private way of\nconstructing the Gaussian copula without compromising computational efficiency.\nThrough experiments on three real-world datasets, we show that we can obtain\nhighly accurate answers to the set of all one-way marginal, and two-and\nthree-way positive conjunction queries, with 99\\% of the query answers having\nabsolute (fractional) error rates between 0.01 to 3\\%.

Any two plabic graphs for\nthe same positroid cell can be related by a sequence of certain moves. The flip\ngraph has plabic graphs as vertices and has edges connecting the plabic graphs\nwhich are related by a single move. A recent result of Galashin shows that\nplabic graphs can be seen as cross-sections of zonotopal tilings for the cyclic\nzonotope $Z(n,3)$. Taking this perspective, we show that the fundamental group\nof the flip graph is generated by cycles of length 4, 5, and 10, and use this\nresult to prove a related conjecture of Dylan Thurston about triple crossing\ndiagrams.

Contrary to stellar-mass black hole\nmergers, such events are expected to be rich X-ray sources due to the accretion\nof material from the circumbinary disks onto the black holes. The orbital\ndynamics before merger is also expected to modulate the resulting X-ray\nemission via Doppler boosting in a quasi-periodic way, and in a simple phase\nrelation with the gravitational wave from the inspiral of the black holes.\nDetecting the X-ray source would enable a precise and early localization of the\nbinary, thus allowing many telescopes to observe the very moment of the merger.\nAlthough identifying the correct X-ray source in the relatively large LISA sky\nlocalization will be challenging due to the presence of many confounding point\nsources, the quasi-periodic modulation may aid in the identification. We\nexplore the practical feasibility of such idea. We simulate populations of\nmerging supermassive black holes, their detection with LISA and their X-ray\nlightcurves using a simple model. Taking the parameters of the X-ray Telescope\non the proposed NASA Transient Astrophysics Probe, we then design and simulate\nan observation campaign that searches for the modulated X-ray source while LISA\nis still observing the inspiral of the black holes.

Yet it is a social\ndilemma since non-vaccinators can benefit from the herd immunity created by the\nvaccinators. Thus the optimum vaccination level is not reached via voluntary\nvaccination at times. Intensive studies incorporate social networks to study\nvaccination behavior, and it is shown that vaccination can be promoted on some\nnetworks. The underlying network, however, is often assumed to be static,\nneglecting the dynamical nature of social networks. We investigate the\nvaccination behavior on dynamical social networks using both simulations and\nmean-field approximations. We find that the more robust the\nvaccinator-infected-non-vaccinator links are or the more fragile the\nvaccinator-healthy-non-vaccinator links are, the higher the final vaccination\nlevel is. This result is true for arbitrary rationality. Furthermore, we show\nthat, under strong selection, the vaccination level can be higher than that in\nthe well-mixed population. In addition, we show that vaccination on evolving\nsocial network is equivalent to the vaccination in well mixed population with a\nrescaled basic reproductive ratio.

Ideally, this rationale would\nextend to quantum dots, often termed artificial atoms, and quantum computation\ncould be performed by merely controlling the outer-shell electrons of dot-based\nqubits. Imperfections in the semiconductor material, including at the atomic\nscale, disrupt this analogy between atoms and quantum dots, so that real\ndevices seldom display such a systematic many-electron arrangement. We\ndemonstrate here an electrostatically-defined quantum dot that is robust to\ndisorder, revealing a well defined shell structure. We observe four shells (31\nelectrons) with multiplicities given by spin and valley degrees of freedom. We\nexplore various fillings consisting of a single valence electron -- namely 1,\n5, 13 and 25 electrons -- as potential qubits, and we identify fillings that\nyield a total spin-1 on the dot. An integrated micromagnet allows us to perform\nelectrically-driven spin resonance (EDSR). Higher shell states are shown to be\nmore susceptible to the driving field, leading to faster Rabi rotations of the\nqubit. We investigate the impact of orbital excitations of the p- and d-shell\nelectrons on single qubits as a function of the dot deformation. This allows us\nto tune the dot excitation spectrum and exploit it for faster qubit control.\nFurthermore, hotspots arising from this tunable energy level structure provide\na pathway towards fast spin initialisation. The observation of spin-1 states\nmay be exploited in the future to study symmetry-protected topological states\nin antiferromagnetic spin chains and their application to quantum computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 05:19:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 03:12:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 08:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-28"}

In analogy to the standard single-reference SES-CC formalism, its\nunitary CC extension allows one to include the dynamical (outside the active\nspace) correlation effects in an SES induced complete active space (CAS)\neffective Hamiltonian. In contrast to the standard single-reference SES-CC\ntheory, the unitary CC approach results in a Hermitian form of the effective\nHamiltonian. Additionally, for the double unitary CC formalis (DUCC) the\ncorresponding CAS eigenvalue problem provides a rigorous separation of external\ncluster amplitudes that describe dynamical correlation effects - used to define\nthe effective Hamiltonian - from those corresponding to the internal (inside\nthe active space) excitations that define the components of eigenvectors\nassociated with the energy of the entire system. The proposed formalism can be\nviewed as an efficient way of downfolding many-electron Hamiltonian to the\nlow-energy model represented by a particular choice of CAS. In principle, this\ntechnique can be extended to any type of complete active space representing an\narbitrary energy window of a quantum system. The Hermitian character of\nlow-dimensional effective Hamiltonians makes them an ideal target for several\ntypes of full configuration interaction (FCI) type eigensolvers. As an example,\nwe also discuss the algebraic form of the perturbative expansions of the\neffective DUCC Hamiltonians corresponding to composite unitary CC theories and\ndiscuss possible algorithms for hybrid classical and quantum computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 05:31:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 04:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

One way to accelerate the coordination effect is to enable multiple\nagents to communicate with each other in a distributed manner and behave as a\ngroup. In this paper, we study a practical scenario when (i) the communication\nbandwidth is limited and (ii) the agents share the communication medium so that\nonly a restricted number of agents are able to simultaneously use the medium,\nas in the state-of-the-art wireless networking standards. This calls for a\ncertain form of communication scheduling. In that regard, we propose a\nmulti-agent deep reinforcement learning framework, called SchedNet, in which\nagents learn how to schedule themselves, how to encode the messages, and how to\nselect actions based on received messages. SchedNet is capable of deciding\nwhich agents should be entitled to broadcasting their (encoded) messages, by\nlearning the importance of each agent's partially observed information. We\nevaluate SchedNet against multiple baselines under two different applications,\nnamely, cooperative communication and navigation, and predator-prey. Our\nexperiments show a non-negligible performance gap between SchedNet and other\nmechanisms such as the ones without communication and with vanilla scheduling\nmethods, e.g., round robin, ranging from 32% to 43%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 05:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-06"}

A\nnovelty of our technique is that it uses a combination of clustering\nmeasurements in luminosity bins to perform a global likelihood analysis,\nsimultaneously constraining the HOD parameters for a range of luminosity\nthresholds. We present simple, smooth fitting functions which accurately\ndescribe the resulting luminosity dependence of the best-fit HOD parameters. To\nminimise systematic halo modelling effects, we use theoretical halo 2-point\ncorrelation functions directly measured and tabulated from a suite of $N$-body\nsimulations spanning a large enough dynamic range in halo mass and spatial\nseparation. Thus, our modelling correctly accounts for non-linear and\nscale-dependent halo bias as well as any departure of halo profiles from\nuniversality, and we additionally account for halo exclusion using the hard\nsphere approximation.

The main theme of the present paper is to propose a new physical\nconcept on reconnection onset and to clarify physical mechanism responsible for\nflares and substorms. Reconnection rate can be defined as inductive electric\nfield along X neutral line, so it is proposed that large-scale reconnection can\noccur when ambient reconnection (inductive) electric fields effectively\npenetrate into X line. In the solar corona or geomagnetic tail without\neffective Coulomb collision, reconnection electric fields are shielded (cut\noff) around X line, so reconnection cannot occur and magnetic energy can be\nstored in the form of current sheets. It is demonstrated that when plasmas\nbecome effectively collisional and dissipative around X line, shielding of\nreconnection electric fields around X line is violated, and reconnection\ndrastically grows to eventually cause the (Petschek-like) fast reconnection\nmechanism responsible for flares and substorms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 08:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-06"}

Providing a phase-coherent link between the optical and the\nmicrowave/radio-frequency regions [2], FCs have become groundbreaking tools for\nprecision measurements[3,4].\n  Despite these inherent advantages, developing miniaturized comb sources\nacross the whole infrared (IR), with an independent and simultaneous control of\nthe two comb degrees of freedom at a metrological level, has not been possible,\nso far. Recently, promising results have been obtained with compact sources,\nnamely diode-laser-pumped microresonators [5,6] and quantum cascade lasers\n(QCL-combs) [7,8]. While both these sources rely on four-wave mixing (FWM) to\ngenerate comb frequency patterns, QCL-combs benefit from a mm-scale\nminiaturized footprint, combined with an ad-hoc tailoring of the spectral\nemission in the 3-250 {\\mu}m range, by quantum engineering [9].\n  Here, we demonstrate full stabilization and control of the two key parameters\nof a QCL-comb against the primary frequency standard.

We apply a novel method to search\nfor asteroid families in the inner Main Belt population of asteroids belonging\nto the X-complex with moderate albedo. Instead of searching for asteroid\nclusters in orbital elements space, which could be severely dispersed when\nolder than some billions of years, our method looks for correlations between\nthe orbital semimajor axis and the inverse size of asteroids. This correlation\nis the signature of members of collisional families, which drifted from a\ncommon centre under the effect of the Yarkovsky thermal effect.

One of them, whose lowest numbered asteroid is (161)\nAuthor, is ~3 Gyrs-old, whereas the second one, whose lowest numbered object is\n(689) Zita, can be as old as the Solar System. Members of this latter family\nhave orbital eccentricities and inclinations that spread them over the entire\ninner Main Belt, which is an indication that this family could be primordial,\ni.e. it formed before the giant planet orbital instability. The vast majority\nof moderate-albedo X-complex asteroids of the inner-Main Belt are genetically\nrelated, as they can be included into few asteroid families. Only nine\nX-complex asteroids with moderate albedo of the inner Main Belt cannot be\nincluded in asteroid families.

Since any realistic pairwise interaction is not a\nmere delta function, the non-interacting picture is an idealisation indicating\nthat the effect of interactions is weaker than in the case of off-resonant\npotentials.

For natural two-body interactions with a\nshort-distance repulsive core and an attractive tail, the emergent three-body\ninteraction is repulsive and, therefore, three bosons do not form any bound\nstates.

While first-order methods for\nconvex optimization enjoy optimal convergence rates, they require in worst-case\nto compute a full-rank SVD on each iteration, in order to compute the\nprojection onto the trace-norm ball. These full-rank SVD computations however\nprohibit the application of such methods to large problems. A simple and\nnatural heuristic to reduce the computational cost is to approximate the\nprojection using only a low-rank SVD. This raises the question if, and under\nwhat conditions, this simple heuristic can indeed result in provable\nconvergence to the optimal solution. In this paper we show that any optimal\nsolution is a center of a Euclid. ball inside-which the projected-gradient\nmapping admits rank that is at most the multiplicity of the largest singular\nvalue of the gradient vector. Moreover, the radius of the ball scales with the\nspectral gap of this gradient vector.

We also quantify the\neffect of \"over-parameterization\", i.e., using SVD computations with higher\nrank, on the radius of this ball, showing it can increase dramatically with\nmoderately larger rank.

Its management is highly time-sensitive\nsince each hour of delayed treatment increases mortality due to irreversible\norgan damage. Meanwhile, despite decades of clinical research, robust\nbiomarkers for sepsis are missing. Therefore, detecting sepsis early by\nutilizing the affluence of high-resolution intensive care records has become a\nchallenging machine learning problem. Recent advances in deep learning and data\nmining promise to deliver a powerful set of tools to efficiently address this\ntask. This empirical study proposes two novel approaches for the early\ndetection of sepsis: a deep learning model and a lazy learner based on time\nseries distances. Our deep learning model employs a temporal convolutional\nnetwork that is embedded in a Multi-task Gaussian Process Adapter framework,\nmaking it directly applicable to irregularly-spaced time series data. Our lazy\nlearner, by contrast, is an ensemble approach that employs dynamic time\nwarping. We frame the timely detection of sepsis as a supervised time series\nclassification task. For this, we derive the most recent sepsis definition in\nan hourly resolution to provide the first fully accessible early sepsis\ndetection environment. Seven hours before sepsis onset, our methods improve\narea under the precision--recall curve from 0.25 to 0.35/0.40 over the state of\nthe art. This demonstrates that they are well-suited for detecting sepsis in\nthe crucial earlier stages when management is most effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 12:35:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 12:53:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 13:18:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 12:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-16"}

The lower lithium content of these stars is a consequence of inside-out\ndisc formation, plus radial migration. In this framework, local stars with\nsuper-solar metallicities would have migrated to the solar vicinity and\ndepleted their original lithium during their travel time. To arrive to such a\nresult, we took advantage of the AMBRE catalog of lithium abundances combined\nwith chemical evolution models which take into account the contribution to the\nlithium enrichment by different nucleosynthetic sources. A large proportion of\nmigrated stars can explain the observed lower lithium abundance at super-solar\nmetallicities. We stress that nowadays, there is no stellar model able to\npredict Li-depletion for such super-solar metallicity stars, and the Solar\nLi-depletion has to be assumed. In addition, it currently exists no solid\nquantitative estimate of the proportion of migrated stars in the Solar\nneighborhood and their travel time. Our results illustrate how important it is\nto properly include radial migration when comparing chemical evolution models\nto observations, and that in this case, the lithium decrease at larger\nmetallicities does not necessarily imply that stellar yields have to be\nmodified, contrary to previous claims in literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 12:36:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 07:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

Such a common envelope\nphase is required to tighten the binary orbit in the formation of many of the\nobserved X-ray binaries and merging compact binary systems. In the formation\nscenario for neutron star binaries, the system might pass through a phase where\na neutron star spirals into the envelope of its giant star companion. These\nphases lead to mass accretion onto the neutron star. Accretion onto these\ncommon-envelope-phase neutron stars can eject matter that has undergone burning\nnear to the neutron star surface. This paper presents nucleosynthetic yields of\nthis ejected matter, using population synthesis models to study the importance\nof these nucleosynthetic yields in a galactic chemical evolution context.\nDepending on the extreme conditions in temperature and density found in the\naccreted material, both proton-rich and neutron-rich nucleosynthesis can be\nobtained, with efficient production of neutron rich isotopes of low Z material\nat the most extreme conditions, and proton rich isotopes, again at low Z, in\nlower density models. Final yields are found to be extremely sensitive to the\nphysical modeling of the accretion phase. We show that neutron stars accreting\nin binary common envelopes might be a new relevant site for galactic chemical\nevolution, and therefore more comprehensive studies are needed to better\nconstrain nucleosynthesis in these objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 12:44:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

To avoid the controller being a single point of failure,\ntraditional fault-tolerance techniques are employed to guarantee availability,\na fundamental requirement in production environments. Unfortunately, these\ntechniques fall short of ensuring correct network behaviour under controller\nfailures. The problem of these techniques is that they deal with only part of\nthe problem: guaranteeing that application and controller state remains\nconsistent between replicas. However, in an SDN the switches maintain hard\nstate that must also be handled consistently. Fault-tolerant SDN must therefore\ninclude switch state into the problem. A recently proposed fault-tolerant\ncontroller platform, Ravana, solves this problem by extending fault-tolerant\nSDN control with mechanisms that guarantee control messages to be processed\ntransactionally and exactly once, at both the controllers and the switches.\nThese guarantees are given even in the face of controller and switch crashes.\nThe elegance of this solution comes at a cost. Ravana requires switches to be\nmodified and OpenFlow to be extended with hitherto unforeseen additions to the\nprotocol. In face of this challenge we propose Rama, a fault-tolerant SDN\ncontroller platform that offers the same strong guarantees as Ravana without\nrequiring modifications to switches or to the OpenFlow protocol. Experiments\nwith our prototype implementation show the additional overhead to be modest,\nmaking Rama the first fault-tolerant SDN solution that can be immediately\ndeployable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 13:23:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-06"}

This can be related\nto the conventional Ito calculus-based framework through the time integral of a\nprice's squared volatility, or `cumulative variance'. In the new framework,\ncorresponding processes are strictly increasing, solve random ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs), and are composed with geometric Brownian motion.\nThe new framework has no dependence on stochastic calculus, so processes can be\nstudied on a pathwise basis using probability-free ODE techniques and\nfunctional analysis.\n  The ODEs considered depend on continuous driving functions which are\n`spatially irregular', meaning they need not have any spatial regularity\nproperties such as Holder continuity. They are however strictly increasing in\ntime, thus temporally asymmetric. When sensible initial values are chosen,\ninitial value problem (IVP) solutions are also strictly increasing, and the\nsolution set of such IVPs is shown to contain all differentiable bijections on\nthe non-negative reals. This enables the modelling of any non-negative\nvolatility path which is not zero over intervals, via the time derivative of\nsolutions. Despite this generality, new well-posedness results establish the\nuniqueness of solutions going forwards in time.\n  Motivation to explore this framework comes from its connection with a\ntime-changed Heston volatility model.

The latter is now yielding\nthe first measurements of latitudinal differential rotation obtained directly\nfrom oscillation frequencies. Differential rotation is a fundamental mechanism\nof the stellar dynamo effect. Our goal is to measure the amount of differential\nrotation in the solar analogues 16 Cyg A and B, which are the components of a\nbinary system. These stars are the brightest observed by Kepler and have\ntherefore been extensively observed, with exquisite precision on their\noscillation frequencies. We modelled the acoustic power spectrum of 16 Cyg A\nand B using a model that takes into account the contribution of differential\nrotation to the rotational frequency splitting. The estimation was carried out\nin a Bayesian setting. We then inverted these results to obtain the rotation\nprofile of both stars under the assumption of a solar-like functional form. We\nobserve that the magnitude of latitudinal differential rotation has a strong\nchance of being solar-like for both stars, their rotation rates being higher at\nthe equator than at the pole. The measured latitudinal differential rotation,\ndefined as the difference of rotation rate between the equator and the pole, is\n$320\\pm269$ nHz and $440^{+363}_{-383}$ nHz for 16 Cyg A and B, respectively,\nconfirming that the rotation rates of these stars are almost solar-like. Their\nequatorial rotation rates are $535\\pm75$ nHz and $565_{-129}^{+150}$ nHz. Our\nresults are in good agreement with measurements obtained from\nspectropolarimetry, spectroscopy, and photometry. We present the first\nconclusive measurement of latitudinal differential rotation for solar\nanalogues. Their rotational profiles are very close to those of the Sun. These\nresults depend weakly on the uncertainties of the stellar parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 13:51:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Feb 2019 11:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

We go beyond the phase terms found by Ryan, which were\nobtained in the quadrupolar approximation of the point-particle limit, and\nderive terms up to the fifth post-Newtonian (PN) order. Since corrections due\nto horizon absorption (i.e., if the central object is a black hole) and tidal\nheating appear by that order, at 2.5PN and 5PN, respectively, we include them\nhere. Corrections due to the motion of the central object, which was addressed\nonly partially by Ryan, are included as well. Additionally, we obtain the\ncontribution of the higher order radiative multipole moments. For the tidal\ninteraction, our results have been derived in the approximation of the\nNewtonian tidal field. Therefore, in the potential for tidal field only the\ncontribution due to the mass of the central object has been included as well.\nUsing these results we argue that it might be possible for LISA to probe if the\ncentral object in an EMRI has a horizon or not. We also discuss how our results\ncan be used to test the No-hair theorem from the inspiral phase of such\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 14:57:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 14:59:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

The pipeline is capable of reducing data\nfrom different VLBI arrays. It can be run non-interactively after only a few\nnon-default input parameters are set and delivers high-quality calibrated data.\nCPU scalability based on a message-passing interface (MPI) implementation\nensures that large bandwidth data from future arrays can be processed within\nreasonable computing times. Phase calibration is done with a Schwab-Cotton\nfringe fit algorithm. For the calibration of residual atmospheric effects,\noptimal solution intervals are determined based on the signal-to-noise ratio\n(S/N) of the data for each scan. Different solution intervals can be set for\ndifferent antennas in the same scan to increase the number of detections in the\nlow S/N regime. These novel techniques allow rPICARD to calibrate data from\ndifferent arrays, including high-frequency and low-sensitivity arrays. The\namplitude calibration is based on standard telescope metadata, and a robust\nalgorithm can solve for atmospheric opacity attenuation in the high-frequency\nregime.

However, developing efficient methods for the\nnonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems with certain performance\nguarantee remains a challenge. Proximal coordinate descent (PCD) has been\nwidely used for solving optimization problems, but the knowledge of PCD methods\nin the nonconvex setting is very limited. On the other hand, the asynchronous\nproximal coordinate descent (APCD) recently have received much attention in\norder to solve large-scale problems. However, the accelerated variants of APCD\nalgorithms are rarely studied. In this paper, we extend APCD method to the\naccelerated algorithm (AAPCD) for nonsmooth and nonconvex problems that\nsatisfies the sufficient descent property, by comparing between the function\nvalues at proximal update and a linear extrapolated point using a delay-aware\nmomentum value.

(2019),\ncarefully accounting for large-angle effects at one order beyond leading. Based\non Monte Carlo trials, the uncertainty in the one-dimensional velocity\ndispersion is $\\approx 100$ m/s when using sky-projected relative velocities.\nUsing line velocities reduces this to $\\approx 30$ m/s because these are much\nless affected by distance uncertainties.\n  My analysis does not support the Hernandez et. al.

To this end, estimating an\noptimal individualized treatment regime (ITR) that recommends treatment\ndecisions based on patient characteristics to maximize the mean of a\npre-specified outcome is of particular interest. Several methods have been\nproposed for estimating an optimal ITR from clinical trial data in the parallel\ngroup setting where each subject is randomized to a single intervention.\nHowever, little work has been done in the area of estimating the optimal ITR\nfrom crossover study designs. Such designs naturally lend themselves to\nprecision medicine, because they allow for observing the response to multiple\ntreatments for each patient. In this paper, we introduce a method for\nestimating the optimal ITR using data from a 2x2 crossover study with or\nwithout carryover effects. The proposed method is similar to policy search\nmethods such as outcome weighted learning; however, we take advantage of the\ncrossover design by using the difference in responses under each treatment as\nthe observed reward.

Several studies have shown that the DRAM-based off-chip memory\naccesses are one of the most energy-consuming operations in deep neural network\n(DNN) accelerators, and thereby limit the designs from achieving efficiency\ngains at the full potential. DRAM access energy varies depending upon the\nnumber of accesses required as well as the energy consumed per-access.\nTherefore, searching for a solution towards the minimum DRAM access energy is\nan important optimization problem. Towards this, we propose the ROMANet\nmethodology that aims at reducing the number of memory accesses, by searching\nfor the appropriate data partitioning and scheduling for each layer of a\nnetwork using a design space exploration, based on the knowledge of the\navailable on-chip memory and the data reuse factors. Moreover, ROMANet also\ntargets decreasing the number of DRAM row buffer conflicts and misses, by\nexploiting the DRAM multi-bank burst feature to improve the energy-per-access.\nBesides providing the energy benefits, our proposed DRAM data mapping also\nresults in an increased effective DRAM throughput, which is useful for\nlatency-constraint scenarios. Our experimental results show that the ROMANet\nsaves DRAM access energy by 12% for the AlexNet, by 36% for the VGG-16, and by\n46% for the MobileNet, while also improving the DRAM throughput by 10%, as\ncompared to the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 20:04:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2020 11:40:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

Typically, this structure or ranking is not known;\ninstead we only have observed outcomes of the interactions, and the goal is to\ninfer the hierarchy from these observations. Discovering a hierarchy in the\ncontext of directed networks can be formulated as follows: given a graph,\npartition vertices into levels such that, ideally, there are only edges from\nupper levels to lower levels. The ideal case can only happen if the graph is\nacyclic. Consequently, in practice we have to introduce a penalty function that\npenalizes edges violating the hierarchy. A practical variant for such penalty\nis agony, where each violating edge is penalized based on the severity of the\nviolation. Hierarchy minimizing agony can be discovered in $O(m^2)$ time, and\nmuch faster in practice. In this paper we introduce several extensions to\nagony. We extend the definition for weighted graphs and allow a cardinality\nconstraint that limits the number of levels. While, these are conceptually\ntrivial extensions, current algorithms cannot handle them, nor they can be\neasily extended. We solve the problem by showing the connection to the\ncapacitated circulation problem, and we demonstrate that we can compute the\nexact solution fast in practice for large datasets. We also introduce a\nprovably fast heuristic algorithm that produces rankings with competitive\nscores. In addition, we show that we can compute agony in polynomial time for\nany convex penalty, and, to complete the picture, we show that minimizing\nhierarchy with any concave penalty is an NP-hard problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 15:52:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 17:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}
