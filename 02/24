Over the past decades, numerous efforts have\nmainly focused on the study of the RBC biomechanical properties that arise from\nthe unique deformability of erythrocytes. Here, we demonstrate nonlinear\noptical effects from human RBCs suspended in different osmotic solutions.\nSpecifically, we observe self-trapping and scattering-resistant nonlinear\npropagation of a laser beam through RBC suspensions under all three osmotic\nconditions, where the strength of the optical nonlinearity increases with\nosmotic pressure on the cells. This tunable nonlinearity is attributed to\noptical forces, particularly the forward scattering and gradient forces.\nInterestingly, in aged blood samples (with lysed cells), a notably different\nnonlinear behavior is observed due to the presence of free hemoglobin. We use a\ntheoretical model with an optical force-mediated nonlocal nonlinearity to\nexplain the experimental observations.

Starting with the\ncelebrated Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma, such reductions have been studied in\ndepth for the Euclidean $(\\ell_2)$ metric, but much less for the Manhattan\n$(\\ell_1)$ metric. Our primary motivation is the approximate nearest neighbor\nproblem in $\\ell_1$. We exploit its reduction to the decision-with-witness\nversion, called approximate \\textit{near} neighbor, which incurs a roughly\nlogarithmic overhead. In 2007, Indyk and Naor, in the context of approximate\nnearest neighbors, introduced the notion of nearest neighbor-preserving\nembeddings.

Even with eventual rescue, evolutionary\ntime lags can cause the population size to temporarily fall below a threshold\nsusceptible to extinction. To reduce extinction risk given human-driven global\nchange, conservation management can enhance populations through actions such as\ncaptive breeding. To quantify the optimal timing of, and indicators for\nengaging in, investment in temporary enhancement to enable evolutionary rescue,\nwe construct a model of coupled demographic-genetic dynamics given a moving\noptimum. We assume 'decelerating change', as might be relevant to climate\nchange, where the rate of environmental change initially exceeds a rate where\nevolutionary rescue is possible, but eventually slows. We analyze the optimal\ncontrol path of an intervention to avoid the population size falling below a\nthreshold susceptible to extinction, minimizing costs. We find that the optimal\npath of intervention initially increases as the population declines, then\ndeclines and ceases when the population growth rate becomes positive, which\nlags the stabilization in environmental change. In other words, the optimal\nstrategy involves increasing investment even in the face of a declining\npopulation, and positive population growth could serve as a signal to end the\nintervention. In addition, a greater carrying capacity relative to the initial\npopulation size decreases the optimal intervention. Therefore, a one-time\naction to increase carrying capacity, such as habitat restoration, can reduce\nthe amount and duration of longer-term investment in population enhancement,\neven if the population is initially lower than and declining away from the new\ncarrying capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Feb 2019 18:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-07"}

The accompanying uncertainty from the finite Monte Carlo\nsample size can be incorporated into parameter estimation by modifying the\nPoisson likelihood. We first review previous Frequentist methods of this type\nby Barlow et al, Bohm et al, and Chirkin, as well as recently proposed\nprobabilistic methods by the author and Arg\\\"uelles et al. We show that all\nthese approaches can be understood in a unified way: they all approximate the\nunderlying probability distribution of the sum of weights in a given bin, the\ncompound Poisson distribution (CPD). The Probabilistic methods marginalize the\nPoisson mean with a distribution that approximates the CPD, while the\nFrequentist counterparts optimize the same integrand treating the mean as a\nnuisance parameter. With this viewpoint we can motivate three new probabilistic\nlikelihoods based on generalized gamma-Poisson mixture distributions which we\nderive in analytic form. Afterwards, we test old and new formulas in different\nparameter estimation settings consisting of a \"background\" and \"signal\"\ndataset. The probablistic counterpart to the Ansatz by Barlow et al.\noutperforms all other existing approaches in various scenarios. We further find\na surprising outcome: usage of the exact CPD is actually bad for parameter\nestimation. A continuous approximation performs much better and in principle\nallows to perform bias-free inference at any level of simulated livetime if the\nfirst two moments of the CPD of each dataset are known exactly. Finally, we\nalso discuss the situation where new Monte Carlo simulation is produced for a\ngiven parameter choice which leads to fluctuations in the computed likelihood\nvalue.

We address this challenge by introducing a\nnon-intrusive reduced basis (RB) method for constructing surrogate models to\nreduce computational cost. In this method, a reduced basis is extracted from a\nset of full-order snapshots by the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and a\ndoubly stochastic radial basis function (DSRBF) is used to learn the projection\ncoefficients. The DSRBF is carried out in the offline stage with a stochastic\nleave-one-out cross-validation algorithm to select the shape parameter, and the\noutputs for new parameter values can be obtained rapidly during the online\nstage. Due to the complete decoupling of the offline and online stages, the\nproposed non-intrusive RB method -- referred to as POD-DSRBF -- provides a\npowerful tool to accelerate the EKI approach for TFDIPs.

By combining an active polar fluid model with measurements of\nphysical forces as a function of tissue size, contractility, cell-cell and\ncell-substrate adhesion, and substrate stiffness, we show that the wetting\ntransition results from the competition between traction forces and contractile\nintercellular stresses.

One important task in\nphylodynamics is to estimate changes in (effective) population size. When\napplied to infectious disease sequences such estimation of population size\ntrajectories can provide information about changes in the number of infections.\nTo model changes in the number of infected individuals, current phylodynamic\nmethods use non-parametric approaches, parametric approaches, and stochastic\nmodeling in conjunction with likelihood-free Bayesian methods. The first class\nof methods yields results that are hard-to-interpret epidemiologically. The\nsecond class of methods provides estimates of important epidemiological\nparameters, such as infection and removal/recovery rates, but ignores variation\nin the dynamics of infectious disease spread. The third class of methods is the\nmost advantageous statistically, but relies on computationally intensive\nparticle filtering techniques that limits its applications. We propose a\nBayesian model that combines phylodynamic inference and stochastic epidemic\nmodels, and achieves computational tractability by using a linear noise\napproximation (LNA) --- a technique that allows us to approximate probability\ndensities of stochastic epidemic model trajectories. LNA opens the door for\nusing modern Markov chain Monte Carlo tools to approximate the joint posterior\ndistribution of the disease transmission parameters and of high dimensional\nvectors describing unobserved changes in the stochastic epidemic model\ncompartment sizes (e.g., numbers of infectious and susceptible individuals). We\napply our estimation technique to Ebola genealogies estimated using viral\ngenetic data from the 2014 epidemic in Sierra Leone and Liberia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2019 02:24:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-26"}

We\nshow that previously analyzed propositions to de-bias the Lasso require a\nmodification in order to enjoy efficiency in a full range of sparsity. This\nmodification takes the form of a degrees-of-freedom adjustment that accounts\nfor the dimension of the model selected by Lasso.\n  Let $s_0$ be the true sparsity. If $\\Sigma$ is known and the ideal score\nvector proportional to $X\\Sigma^{-1}a_0$ is used, the unadjusted de-biasing\nschemes proposed previously enjoy efficiency if $s_0\\lll n^{2/3}$. However, if\n$s_0\\ggg n^{2/3}$, the unadjusted schemes cannot be efficient in certain $a_0$:\nthen it is necessary to modify existing procedures by a degrees-of-freedom\nadjustment.

First of all, we show that massive Yang-Mills model is obtained as a\ngauge-fixed version of the gauge-invariantly extended theory which is\nidentified with the gauge-scalar model with a single fixed-modulus scalar field\nin the fundamental representation of the gauge group. This equivalence is\nobtained through the gauge-independent description of the Brout-Englert-Higgs\nmechanism proposed recently by one of the authors. Then, we reconfirm that the\nEuclidean gluon and ghost propagators in the Landau gauge obtained by numerical\nsimulations on the lattice are reproduced with good accuracy from the massive\nYang-Mills model by taking into account one-loop quantum corrections. Moreover,\nwe demonstrate in a numerical way that the Schwinger function calculated from\nthe gluon propagator in the Euclidean region exhibits violation of the\nreflection positivity at the physical point of the parameters. In addition, we\nperform the analytic continuation of the gluon propagator from the Euclidean\nregion to the complex momentum plane towards the Minkowski region. We give an\nanalytical proof that the reflection positivity is violated for any choice of\nthe parameters in the massive Yang-Mills model, due to the existence of a pair\nof complex conjugate poles and the negativity of the spectral function for the\ngluon propagator to one-loop order. The complex structure of the propagator\nenables us to explain why the gluon propagator in the Euclidean region is well\ndescribed by the Gribov-Stingl form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2019 04:58:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 15:18:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2020 01:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

A situation is considered in which\nmatter from a companion star flows into a gravitational field of a compact star\ncarrying a certain amount of specific angular momentum and first forms a\ngeometrically thick ring-tube along the Keplerian circular orbit. For the model\nto well fit to the observations, it is necessary that the optical depth of the\nring-tube for Compton scattering, $\\tau \\simeq 1 \\sim 2$, the ring matter\ntemperature, $T \\simeq 10^{5} \\sim 10^{6}$ K and the ionization parameter, $\\xi\n\\simeq 10^{2}$ erg cm s$^{-1}$ due to X-ray heating from the central X-ray\nsource.

The time during which matter accumulates in the ring is\nestimated to be $\\sim 10^{6}$ s, and is shown to be comparable to the time for\nan accretion disk to extend from the ring. It is discussed that in the above\n$T$ and $\\xi$ ranges, the ring-tube matter could become thermally unstable.\nThen, relatively high density regions in the ring-tube further cools down and\ntends to shrink to the tube center. The flow across the ring circulating flow\nshould excite turbulent motions, and angular momenta of the matter would be\neffectively transferred across the tube. Finally, a steady flow should be\nestablished from the companion star through the accretion ring to the accretion\ndisk towards the central compact star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2019 10:44:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-26"}

Because of the Nielsen-Ninomiya \"no-go theorem\", the\ntotal chiral magnetic current is absent in the equilibrium state. One of the\nmechanisms for generating this current is the chiral anomaly. This phenomenon\nis the anomalous nonconservation of chiral charge for massless relativistic\nparticles. It can be realized by parallel magnetic and electric fields, and it\nleads to such new transport phenomenon as the negative longitudinal\nmagnetoresistance. Using a simple theory (we consider both linearized and\nlattice model), we have shown, that in Weyl metals with tilted dispersion\nanother mechanism of the chiral magnetic current is possible. It is not\nassociated with the chiral anomaly. The new transport mechanism is based on the\nrelativistic effect of electric field on Landau levels. This effect is that an\nelectric field changes the distance between the Landau levels, and also changes\nthe effective velocity along magnetic field. At presence of a tilt in the\nspectrum, this velocity renormalization is differ for different Weyl points.\nThis leads to a non-zero resulting drift velocity. As a consequence, an\nelectrical current arises along the magnetic field. The induced by this\nmechanism the electric current is proportional to the pseudoscalar product of\nthe fields and directed along the magnetic field, that differs it from the Hall\ncurrent. At the same time, the conductivity corresponding to this transport\nmechanism does not depend on the scattering time like the Hall conductivity.\nThus, we have proposed a new anomalous transport mechanism in the Weyl\nsemimetal, which is not associated with the chiral anomaly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2019 13:29:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 18:26:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Specifically, the requests of each\nfile, which is further divided into a number of segments, are modeled as a\nPoisson point process within its finite lifetime. Two downlink transmission\nmodes are considered: (1) the base station reactively multicasts the file\nsegments to the requesting users and selected cache nodes; (2) the base station\nproactively multicasts some file segments to the selected cache nodes without\nrequests. The cache nodes with decoded file segments can help to offload the\ntraffic via other spectrum. Without the proactive multicast, we formulate the\ndownlink transmission resource minimization as a dynamic programming problem\nwith random stage number, which can be approximated via a finite-horizon Markov\ndecision process (MDP) with fixed stage number. To address the prohibitively\nhuge state space, we propose a low-complexity scheduling policy by linearly\napproximating the value functions of the MDP, where the bound on the\napproximation error is derived. Moreover, we propose a learning-based algorithm\nto evaluate the approximated value functions for unknown geographical\ndistribution of requesting users. Finally, given the above reactive multicast\npolicy, a proactive multicast policy is introduced to exploit the temporal\ndiversity of shadowing effect.

During the 21st century, global\ncooling demand is expected to grow significantly due to the increase in wealth\nand population in sunny nations across the globe and the advance of global\nwarming. The same locations that see high demand for cooling are also ideal for\nelectricity generation via photovoltaics (PV). Despite the apparent synergy\nbetween cooling demand and PV generation, the potential of the cooling sector\nto sustain PV generation has not been assessed on a global scale. Here, we\nperform a global assessment of increased PV electricity adoption enabled by the\nresidential cooling sector during the 21st century. Already today, utilizing PV\nproduction for cooling could facilitate an additional installed PV capacity of\napproximately 540 GW, more than the global PV capacity of today. Using\nestablished scenarios of population and income growth, as well as accounting\nfor future global warming, we further project that the global residential\ncooling sector could sustain an added PV capacity between 20-200 GW each year\nfor most of the 21st century, on par with the current global manufacturing\ncapacity of 100 GW. Furthermore, we find that without storage, PV could\ndirectly power approximately 50% of cooling demand, and that this fraction is\nset to increase from 49% to 56% during the 21st century, as cooling demand\ngrows in locations where PV and cooling have a higher synergy. With this\ngeographic shift in demand, the potential of distributed storage also grows. We\nsimulate that with a 1 m$^3$ water-based latent thermal storage per household,\nthe fraction of cooling demand met with PV would increase from 55% to 70%\nduring the century. These results show that the synergy between cooling and PV\nis notable and could significantly accelerate the growth of the global PV\nindustry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Feb 2019 10:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

However, most of the traditional\ntext mining methods perform somewhat poor in terms of employing such relations.\nIn this paper, we propose a sentence-level graph-based text representation\nwhich includes stop words to consider semantic and term relations.

Eventually, the\nlearned features of the documents are fed into a deep neural network for the\nsentiment classification task.

In this paper, we show the feasibility and study\nthe performance of image classification using IoT devices. Specifically, we\nexplore the relationships between various factors of image classification\nalgorithms that may affect energy consumption such as dataset size, image\nresolution, algorithm type, algorithm phase, and device hardware. Our\nexperiments show a strong, positive linear relationship between three predictor\nvariables, namely model complexity, image resolution, and dataset size, with\nrespect to energy consumption. In addition, in order to provide a means of\npredicting the energy consumption of an edge device performing image\nclassification, we investigate the usage of three machine learning algorithms\nusing the data generated from our experiments. The performance as well as the\ntrade offs for using linear regression, Gaussian process, and random forests\nare discussed and validated.
