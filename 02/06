It is generally believed that\nsuch a nonlocal behavior of the magnetic field is not possible in classical\nphysics and that this represents a clear difference between classical and\nquantum mechanics. Contrary to these beliefs, we argue that the classical\ncounterpart of the Aharonov-Bohm phase, which is identified here with the\nelectromagnetic angular momentum of the configuration formed by an electric\ncharge moving around an infinitely-long solenoid enclosing a uniform magnetic\nflux, shows that the magnetic field may produce nonlocal effects in classical\nmechanics. We discuss this momentum in detail by putting special emphasis on\nits topological and nonlocal features. The momentum is topological because it\ndepends on the number of windings the electric charge carries out around the\nsolenoid and is nonlocal because the magnetic flux has no local consequences at\nany point on the charge trajectory. The topological feature allows us to\nintroduce the concept of accumulated electromagnetic angular momentum and the\nnonlocal feature allows us to speak of a dynamical nonlocality attributable to\nthe equations of classical electrodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 16:50:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 14:38:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 17:51:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 18:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-22"}

Here we report our study of how\nthe debris streams arise from possible thermally-driven disruptions in the\nnear-Sun region. We calculate that a small body with a diameter $\\gtrsim0.5$ km\ncan produce a sufficient amount of material to allow the detection of the\ndebris at the Earth as meteor showers, and that bodies at such sizes thermally\ndisrupt every $\\sim2$ kyrs. We also find that objects from the inner parts of\nthe asteroid belt are more likely to become Sun-approacher than those from the\nouter parts. We simulate the formation and evolution of the debris streams\nproduced from a set of synthetic disrupting asteroids drawn from Granvik et al.\n(2016)'s near-Earth object population model, and find that they evolve 10--70\ntimes faster than streams produced at ordinary solar distances. We compare the\nsimulation results to a catalog of known meteor showers on Sun-approaching\norbits. We show that there is a clear overabundance of Sun-approaching meteor\nshowers, which is best explained by a combining effect of comet contamination\nand an extended disintegration phase that lasts up to a few kyrs. We suggest\nthat a few asteroid-like Sun-approaching objects that brighten significantly at\ntheir perihelion passages could, in fact, be disrupting asteroids. An extended\nperiod of thermal disruption may also explain the widespread detection of\ntransiting debris in exoplanetary systems.

The\nobtained analytical and simulation results show that the SER of the AC and\ncoherent MASK detectors are comparable, particularly for high values of the\nRician K-factor, and small number of receiving antennas. Moreover, the obtained\nresults show that the SER of the optimal AC detector is equivalent to that of\nthe coherent detector. However, the optimal AC detector complexity is\nprohibitively high, particularly at high SNRs. In most of the scenarios, the\nheuristic AC detector significantly outperforms the optimum noncoherent\ndetector, except for the binary ASK case at low SNRs. Moreover, the obtained\nresults show that the heuristic AC detector is immune to phase noise, and thus,\nit outperforms the coherent detector in scenarios where system is subject to\nconsiderable phase noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 17:39:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-06"}

The hierarchically low rank block partitioning produces\nrepresentations that can be stored and operated on in near-linear complexity\ninstead of the usual polynomial complexity of dense matrices. In this paper, we\npresent high performance implementations of matrix vector multiplication and\ncompression operations for the $\\mathcal{H}^2$ variant of hierarchical matrices\non GPUs. This variant exploits, in addition to the hierarchical block\npartitioning, hierarchical bases for the block representations and results in a\nscheme that requires only $O(n)$ storage and $O(n)$ complexity for the mat-vec\nand compression kernels. These two operations are at the core of algebraic\noperations for hierarchical matrices, the mat-vec being a ubiquitous operation\nin numerical algorithms while compression/recompression represents a key\nbuilding block for other algebraic operations, which require periodic\nrecompression during execution. The difficulties in developing efficient GPU\nalgorithms come primarily from the irregular tree data structures that underlie\nthe hierarchical representations, and the key to performance is to recast the\ncomputations on flattened trees in ways that allow batched linear algebra\noperations to be performed.

The social\nconnections of a given person may have very high variability: from close\nfriends and relatives to acquaintances to people who hardly know. Inferring the\nstrength of social ties is an important ingredient for modeling the interaction\nof users in a network and understanding their behavior. Furthermore, the\nproblem has applications in computational social science, viral marketing, and\npeople recommendation.\n  In this paper we study the problem of inferring the strength of social ties\nin a given network. Our work is motivated by a recent approach [27], which\nleverages the strong triadic closure (STC) principle, a hypothesis rooted in\nsocial psychology [13]. To guide our inference process, in addition to the\nnetwork structure, we also consider as input a collection of tight communities.\nThose are sets of vertices that we expect to be connected via strong ties. Such\ncommunities appear in different situations, e.g., when being part of a\ncommunity implies a strong connection to one of the existing members.\n  We consider two related problem formalizations that reflect the assumptions\nof our setting: small number of STC violations and strong-tie connectivity in\nthe input communities. We show that both problem formulations are NP-hard. We\nalso show that one problem formulation is hard to approximate, while for the\nsecond we develop an algorithm with approximation guarantee. We validate the\nproposed method on real-world datasets by comparing with baselines that\noptimize STC violations and community connectivity separately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 18:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-06"}

Such binaries experience perturbations from random stellar\nfly-bys which excite their eccentricities. Once a wide-binary is driven to a\nsufficiently small peri-center approach, GW-emission becomes significant, and\nthe binary inspirals and merges.

The observed radio\nfluence peaks once the optical depth ahead of the shock to induced Compton\nscattering decreases to <~ few, a condition which places a GHz observer on the\nhigh frequency tail of the maser SED. Given intervals between ion shell\nejection events ~1e5 s similar to the occurrence rate of the most powerful\nbursts from FRB 121102, we demonstrate the production of FRBs of frequency ~\n0.1-10 GHz, isotropic radiated energies ~1e37-1e40 erg and durations ~0.1-10 ms\nfor flares of energy ~1e43-1e45 erg.

We explore the possibility to break the degeneracy\nbetween modified gravity and neutrino effects in the growth of structures by\nconsidering kinematic information related to either the growth rate on large\nscales or the virial velocities inside of collapsed structures. In order to\nstudy the degeneracy up to fully non-linear scales, we employ a suite of\n$N$-body simulations including both $f(R)$ modified gravity and massive\nneutrinos.

In\nsuch models with a power spectrum comparable to $\\Lambda$CDM today, the growth\nrate is strictly enhanced.

Explaining the presence of\nsuper-Jovian planets at large separations, as revealed by direct imaging, is\ncurrently an open question.\n  We want to derive statistical constraints on the mass and initial entropy of\nHIP65426b and to explore possible formation pathways of directly imaged objects\nwithin the core-accretion paradigm, focusing on HIP65426b.\n  Constraints on the planet's mass and post-formation entropy are derived from\nits age and luminosity combined with cooling models. For the first time, the\nresults of population synthesis are also used to inform the results. Then, a\nformation model that includes N-body dynamics with several embryos per disc is\nused to study possible formation histories and the properties of possible\nadditional companions. Finally, the outcomes of two- and three-planet\nscattering in the post-disc phase are analysed, taking tides into account.\n  The mass of HIP65426b is found to be Mp = 9.9 +1.1 -1.8 MJ using the hot\npopulation and Mp = 10.9 +1.4 -2.0 MJ with the cold-nominal population. Core\nformation at small separations from the star followed by outward scattering and\nrunaway accretion at a few hundred AU succeeds in reproducing the mass and\nseparation of HIP65426b. Alternatively, systems having two or more giant\nplanets close enough to be on an unstable orbit at disc dispersal are likely to\nend up with one planet on a wide HIP65426b-like orbit with a relatively high\neccentricity (>~ 0.5).\n  If this scattering scenario explains its formation, HIP65426b is predicted to\nhave a high eccentricity and to be accompanied by one or several roughly\nJovian-mass planets at smaller semi-major axes, which also could have a high\neccentricity.

Discovering hierarchy from a given\ndirected network can be formulated as follows: partition vertices into levels\nsuch that, ideally, there are only forward edges, that is, edges from upper\nlevels to lower levels. In practice, the ideal case is impossible, so instead\nwe minimize some penalty function on the backward edges. One practical option\nfor such a penalty is agony, where the penalty depends on the severity of the\nviolation. In this paper we extend the definition of agony to temporal\nnetworks. In this setup we are given a directed network with time stamped\nedges, and we allow the rank assignment to vary over time. We propose 2\nstrategies for controlling the variation of individual ranks. In our first\nvariant, we penalize the fluctuation of the rankings over time by adding a\npenalty directly to the optimization function. In our second variant we allow\nthe rank change at most once. We show that the first variant can be solved\nexactly in polynomial time while the second variant is NP-hard, and in fact\ninapproximable.

Actual ship wakes differ in their appearance from both each other\nand Kelvin's prediction. The difference can be attributed to a deviation from\nthe point source limit and for given shape of the disturbance quantified by the\nFroude number $F$.

Further, resulting wake patterns are qualitatively different\ndepending on whether water-piercing is present or not (\"sharp\" vs \"smooth\"\ndisturbances). For smooth pressure sources, we generalize Kelvin's stationary\nphase argument to encompass finite size effects and classify resulting wake\npatterns.

Utilizing multiple\npolarizing matrices increases the length flexibility of polar codes at the\nexpense of a more complicated decoding process.

Some of these index\nstructures far more complex than a single string, as was originally done with\nthe FM-index [Ferragina and Manzini, J. ACM 2005]. As such, there has been an\neffort to better understand under which conditions such an indexing scheme is\npossible. This led to the introduction of Wheeler graphs [Gagie it et al.,\nTheor. Comput. Sci., 2017]. A Wheeler graph is a directed graph with edge\nlabels which satisfies two simple axioms. Wheeler graphs can be indexed in a\nway which is space efficient and allows for fast traversal. Gagie et al. showed\nthat de Bruijn graphs, generalized compressed suffix arrays, and several other\nBWT related structures can be represented as Wheeler graphs. Here we answer the\nopen question of whether or not there exists an efficient algorithm for\nrecognizing if a graph is a Wheeler graph. We demonstrate:(i) Recognizing if a\ngraph is a Wheeler graph is NP-complete for any edge label alphabet of size\n$\\sigma \\geq 2$, even for DAGs. It can be solved in linear time for $\\sigma\n=1$; (ii) An optimization variant called Wheeler Graph Violation (WGV) which\naims to remove the minimum number of edges needed to obtain a Wheeler graph is\nAPX-hard, even for DAGs. Hence, unless P = NP, there exists constant $C > 1$\nsuch that there is no $C$-approximation algorithm. We show conditioned on the\nUnique Games Conjecture, for every constant $C \\geq 1$, it is NP-hard to find a\n$C$-approximation to WGV; (iii) The Wheeler Subgraph problem (WS) which aims to\nfind the largest Wheeler subgraph is in APX for $\\sigma=O(1)$; (iv) For the\nabove problems there exist efficient exponential time exact algorithms, relying\non graph isomorphism being computed in strictly sub-exponential time; (v) A\nclass of graphs where the recognition problem is polynomial time solvable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 22:29:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 19:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

In the previous models of protostellar\nflares, the interaction between a protostellar magnetosphere with the\nsurrounding disk plays crucial roles in building-up and releasing the magnetic\nenergy. However, it remains unclear if protostars indeed have magnetospheres\nbecause vigorous disk accretion and strong disk magnetic fields in the\nprotostellar phase may destroy the magnetosphere. Considering this possibility,\nwe investigate the energy accumulation and release processes in the absence of\na magnetosphere using a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation. Our\nsimulation reveals that protostellar flares are repeatedly produced even in\nsuch a case. Unlike in the magnetospheric models, the protostar accumulates\nmagnetic energy by acquiring large-scale magnetic fields from the disk by\naccretion. Protostellar flares occur when a portion of the large-scale magnetic\nfields are removed from the protostar as a result of magnetic reconnection.\nProtostellar flares in the simulation are consistent with observations; the\nreleased magnetic energy (up to $\\sim 3\\times 10^{38}$ erg) is large enough to\ndrive observed flares, and the flares produce hot ejecta. The expelled magnetic\nfields enhance accretion, and the energy build-up and release processes are\nrepeated as a result. The magnetic flux removal via reconnection leads to\nredistribution of magnetic fields in the inner disk. We therefore consider that\nprotostellar flares will play an important role in the evolution of the disk\nmagnetic fields in the vicinity of protostars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 03:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 01:56:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

We provide the first comprehensive study of pace within the sport of\nhockey, focusing on how teams and players impact pace in different regions of\nthe ice, and the resultant effect on other aspects of the game.\n  First we examined how pace of play varies across the surface of the rink,\nacross different periods, at different manpower situations, between different\nprofessional leagues, and through time between seasons. Our analysis of pace by\nzone helps to explain some of the counter-intuitive results reported in prior\nstudies. For instance, we show that the negative correlation between attacking\nspeed and shots/goals is likely due to a large decline in attacking speed in\nthe OZ.\n  We also studied how pace impacts the outcomes of various events. We found\nthat pace is positively-correlated with both high-danger zone entries (e.g.\nodd-man rushes) and higher shot quality. However, we find that passes with\nfailed receptions occur at higher speeds than successful receptions. These\nfindings suggest that increased pace is beneficial, but perhaps only up to a\ncertain extent. Higher pace can create breakdowns in defensive structure and\nlead to better scoring chances but can also lead to more turnovers.\n  Finally, we analyzed team and player-level pace in the NHL, highlighting the\nconsiderable variability in how teams and players attack and defend against\npace.

These PDEs are fluid descriptions of plasmas, where the\neffect of collisions is neglected (no resistivity), while the motion of the\nelectrons relative to the ions (Hall current term) is taken into account. The\nHall current term endows the magnetic field equation with a quasilinear\ndispersive character, which is key to our mechanism for illposedness. Perhaps\nthe most striking conclusion of this article is that the Cauchy problems for\nthe Hall-MHD (either viscous or inviscid) and the electron-MHD equations, under\none translational symmetry, are ill-posed near the trivial solution in any\nsufficiently high regularity Sobolev space and even in Gevrey spaces. This\nresult holds despite obvious wellposedness of the linearized equations near the\ntrivial solution, as well as conservation of the nonlinear energy, by which the\n$L^{2}$ norm (energy) of the solution stays constant in time. The core\nillposedness mechanism is degeneration of certain high frequency wave packet\nsolutions to the linearization around a class of linearly degenerate stationary\nsolutions of these equations, which are essentially dispersive equations with\ndegenerate principal symbols. The method developed in this work is sharp and\nrobust, in that we also prove nonlinear $H^{s}$-illposedness in the presence of\nfractional dissipation of any order less than 1, matching known wellposedness\nresults.

In this region,\nthe absence of dominant linear mechanisms is reflected in the lack of low-rank\ncharacteristics of the resolvent and in the disagreement between the structure\nof resolvent modes and actual flow features. To demonstrate the procedure, we\nchoose low Reynolds number cylinder flow and the Couette equilibrium solution\nEQ1, which are representative of very low-rank flows dominated by one linear\nmechanism. The former is evolving in time, allowing us to compare resolvent\nmodes with Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) modes at the first and second\nharmonics of the shedding frequency. There is a match between the modes at the\nfirst harmonic but not at the second harmonic where there is no separation of\nthe resolvent operator's singular values. We compute the self-interaction of\nthe resolvent mode at the shedding frequency and illustrate its similarity to\nthe nonlinear forcing of the second harmonic.

A similar phenomenon is observed for the fundamental streamwise\nwavenumber of the EQ1 solution and its second harmonic. The importance of\nparasitic modes, labeled as such since they are driven by the amplified\nfrequencies, is their contribution to the nonlinear forcing of the main\namplification mechanisms as shown for the shedding mode, which has subtle\ndiscrepancies with its DMD counterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 05:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-07"}

Changing the size of one or many grains tunes the pressure, which\ncontrols the vibrational response of the device.

In this paper, an adversarial example attack\nwhich triggers malfunctioning of NMS in end-to-end OD models is proposed. The\nattack, namely \\texttt{Daedalus}, compresses the dimensions of detection boxes\nto evade NMS. As a result, the final detection output contains extremely dense\nfalse positives. This can be fatal for many OD applications such as autonomous\nvehicles and surveillance systems. The attack can be generalised to different\nend-to-end OD models, such that the attack cripples various OD applications.\nFurthermore, a way to craft robust adversarial examples is developed by using\nan ensemble of popular detection models as the substitutes.

We aim at characterising the mass, kinematics,\nand stability against gravitational collapse of a statistically significant\nsample of filaments in the Orion B molecular cloud, which is renown for its\nvery low star formation efficiency. We characterise the gas column densities\nand kinematics over a field of 1.9 deg$^2$, using C$^{18}$O(J=1-0) data from\nthe IRAM-30m large programme ORION-B. Using two different Hessian-based\nfilters, we extract and compare two filamentary networks, each containing over\n100 filaments. Independent of the extraction method, the filaments have widths\nof 0.12$\\pm$0.04 pc, and show a wide range of linear (1 - 100\n$M_{\\odot}$pc$^{-1}$) and volume densities (2.10$^3$ - 2.10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$).\nCompared to previous studies, the filament population is dominated by\nlow-density, thermally sub-critical structures, suggesting that most of the\nidentified filaments are not collapsing to form stars. In fact, only ~1% of the\nOrion B cloud mass covered by our observations can be found in super-critical,\nstar-forming filaments, explaining the low star formation efficiency of the\nregion. The velocity profiles observed across the filaments show quiescence in\nthe centre, and coherency in the plane of the sky, despite being mostly\nsupersonic. The filaments in Orion B apparently belong to a continuum which\ncontains a few elements comparable to already studied star-forming filaments as\nwell as many lower-density, gravitationally unbound structures. This\ncomprehensive study of the Orion B filaments shows that the mass fraction in\nsuper-critical filaments is a key factor in determining star formation\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 09:19:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 14:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

The HiRise camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has\ncaptured high-resolution images covering large tracts of the surface.

A critical capability gap exists in our ability to image,\nprovide services and explore large tracts of the surface of Mars required for\nenabling a future human mission. A promising solution is to develop a\nreconnaissance sailplane that travels tens to hundreds of kilometers per sol.\nThe aircraft would be equipped with imagers that provide that in-situ depth of\nfield, with coverage comparable to orbital assets such as MRO. A major\nchallenge is that the Martian carbon dioxide atmosphere is thin, with a\npres-sure of 1% of Earth at sea level.

This presents the need for a surveillance\nspacecraft to observe the surface of small bodies where these features exist.\nWhile traditionally, the small body exploration has been performed by a large\nmonolithic spacecraft, a group of small, low-cost spacecraft can enhance the\nobservational value of the mission.

A common and well-known practice to reduce this increasing\ncomputational effort is to take advantage of the translational symmetry $C_N$\nin periodic systems. This represents a rather simple yet elegant application of\nthe group theoretical symmetry projection operator technique. For isotropic\nexchange interactions, the spin-rotational symmetry SU(2) can be used, where\nthe Hamiltonian matrix is block-structured according to the total spin- and\nmagnetization quantum numbers. Rewriting the Heisenberg Hamiltonian in terms of\nirreducible tensor operators allows for an efficient and highly parallelizable\nimplementation to calculate its matrix elements recursively in the\nspin-coupling basis. When combining both $C_N$ and SU(2), mathematically, the\nsymmetry projection technique leads to ready-to-use formulas. However, the\nevaluation of these formulas is very demanding in both computation time and\nmemory consumption, problems which are said to outweigh the benefits of the\nsymmetry reduced matrix shape. We show a way to minimize the computational\neffort for selected systems and present the largest numerically accessible\ncases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 10:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

The Generalised Baker-Schmidt Problem (1970)\nconcerns the $g$-dimensional Hausdorff measure ($\\HH^g$-measure) of the set of\n$\\Psi$-approximable points on nondegenerate manifolds. The problem relates the\n`size' of the set of $\\Psi$-approximable points with the convergence or\ndivergence of a certain series. In the dual approximation setting, the\ndivergence case has been established by Beresnevich-Dickinson-Velani (2006) for\nany nondegenerate manifold. The convergence case, however, represents a major\nchallenging open problem and progress thus far has been effectuated in limited\ncases only. In this paper, we discuss and prove several results on the\n$\\HH^g$-measure on Veronese curves in any dimension $n$.

Tibial bone density and texture was evaluated from radiographs\nwith both minimal and clinical post-processing in 109 subjects with and without\nosteoarthritis. Bone texture was evaluated using fractal signature analysis.\nSignificant correlations (p<0.001) were found in all regions (between 0.94 and\n0.97) for calibrated bone density between radiographs with minimal and clinical\npost-processing. Correlations varied between 0.51 and 0.97 (p<0.001) for FD_Ver\ntexture variable and between -0.10 and 0.97 for FD_Hor.

Furthermore, flow-based models have recently been shown to be\nan attractive alternative that scales well to high-dimensional data. In this\npaper we close the performance gap by constructing VAE models that can\neffectively utilize a deep hierarchy of stochastic variables and model complex\ncovariance structures. We introduce the Bidirectional-Inference Variational\nAutoencoder (BIVA), characterized by a skip-connected generative model and an\ninference network formed by a bidirectional stochastic inference path.

We observe that BIVA, in contrast\nto recent results, can be used for anomaly detection. We attribute this to the\nhierarchy of latent variables which is able to extract high-level semantic\nfeatures.

However, the impact of ocean dynamics on the habitable zone's\nboundaries (inner edge and outer edge) is still unknown and represents a major\ngap in our understanding of this type of planets. Here we use a coupled\natmosphere-ocean global climate model to show that planetary heat transport\nfrom the day to night side is dominated by the ocean at lower stellar fluxes\nand by the atmosphere near the inner edge of the habitable zone. This decrease\nin oceanic heat transport (OHT) at high stellar fluxes is mainly due to\nweakening of surface wind stress and a decrease in surface shortwave energy\ndeposition. We further show that ocean dynamics have almost no effect on the\nobservational thermal phase curves of planets near the inner edge of the\nhabitable zone. For planets in the habitable zone's middle range, ocean\ndynamics moves the hottest spot on the surface eastward from the substellar\npoint. These results suggest that future studies of the inner edge may devote\ncomputational resources to atmosphere-only processes such as clouds and\nradiation. For studies of the middle range and outer edge of the habitable\nzone, however, fully coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling will be necessary.

The first one is\nbased on the magnitude of the events listed in the earthquake catalogue, and\nlocated within the active seismogenic zones. This is the standard approach,\nused in most of the NDSHA computations performed up to now. It is adequate for\ncountries, like Italy, where the catalogue can be reasonably considered\ncomplete for events of M=5 and above.

To represent free energy of the subsystem of mobile charges in the\nform of a functional of their density and to calculate cell potentials of the\nmean forces by the method of conditional distributions, a cumulant expansion\nwith respect to the renormalized Mayer functions is used. To take into account\nthe screening effects, the results of the collective variables method are used.\nA system of integral equations for the potentials of mean forces is obtained\nthat accounts for the effects of near- and long-range interactions.

The correlation component\ndistinguished in the expression for the binary distribution function makes it\npossible to calculate the correlated and uncorrelated parts of the electric\npotential using the Poisson equation. In the case of sufficiently small\nelectric fields, a linear expansion of the chemical potential in terms of\ndeviation of the charge concentration from the homogeneous distribution is\nconsidered. In final calculations the correlation between particles is taken\ninto account in the approximation of the first neighbors. In this approximation\nthe potential and charge concentration distribution is described by a linear\ndifferential equation of the fourth order.

Here, we develop an efficient method for simulating Raman spectra of\nalloys, benchmark it against full density-functional theory calculations, and\napply it to several alloys of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides.\nIn this method, the Raman tensor for the supercell mode is constructed by\nsumming up the Raman tensors of the pristine system weighted by the projections\nof the supercell vibrational modes to those of the pristine system.

Ever since the first realization of such a hybrid\nquantum nanophotonic, heating rates of the atomic motion observed in various\nexperimental settings have typically been exceeding those in comparable\nfree-space optical microtraps by about three orders of magnitude. This\nexcessive heating is a roadblock for the implementation of certain protocols\nand devices. Its origin has so far remained elusive and, at the typical\natom-surface separations of less than an optical wavelength encountered in\nnanophotonic traps, numerous effects may potentially contribute to atom\nheating. Here, we theoretically describe the effect of mechanical vibrations of\nwaveguides on guided light fields and provide a general theory of\nparticle-phonon interaction in nanophotonic traps. We test our theory by\napplying it to the case of laser-cooled cesium atoms in nanofiber-based\ntwo-color optical traps. We find excellent quantitative agreement between the\npredicted heating rates and experimentally measured values. Our theory predicts\nthat, in this setting, the dominant heating process stems from the\noptomechanical coupling of the optically trapped atoms to the continuum of\nthermally occupied flexural mechanical modes of the waveguide structure. Beyond\nunraveling the long-standing riddle of excessive heating in nanofiber-based\natom traps, we also study the dependence of the heating rates on the relevant\nsystem parameters. Our findings allow us to propose several strategies for\nminimizing the heating. Finally, our findings are also highly relevant for\noptomechanics experiments with dielectric nanoparticles that are optically\ntrapped close to nanophotonic waveguides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 14:26:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 13:09:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 14:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

The complexity of exact\nminimization of this problem is well understood [34], and the class of digraphs\nH, for which the MinHOM(H) is polynomial time solvable is a small subset of all\ndigraphs.\n  In this paper, we consider the approximation of MinHOM within a constant\nfactor.

In\nthis respect, first, the effect of a Tikhonov regularisation in the Hilbert\nspace is analysed where the one-class learning problem in presence of\ncontaminations in the training set is posed as a sensitivity analysis problem.\nNext, driven by the success of the sparse representation methodology, the\neffect of a sparsity regularisation on the solution is studied. For both\nalternative regularisation schemes, iterative algorithms are proposed which\nrecursively update label confidences and rank training observations based on\ntheir fit with the model. Through extensive experiments conducted on different\ndata sets, the proposed methodology is found to enhance robustness against\ncontamination in the training set as compared with the baseline kernel\nnull-space technique as well as other existing approaches in a one-class\nclassification paradigm while providing the functionality to rank training\nsamples effectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 14:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-07"}

The study of HESS J1825-137 was carried out on the basis of new radio\nobservations centred at the position of PSR J1826-1334 performed with the Karl\nG.

The new radio continuum image towards PSR\nJ1826-1334 reveals a bright radio source, with the pulsar located in its\ncentre, which suggests that this feature could be the radio counterpart of the\ncompact component of the PWN detected at high energy. The new 1.4 GHz radio\ndata do not reveal emission with an extension comparable with that observed in\n$\\gamma$-rays for the HESS J1825-137 source. On the other hand, the XMM-Newton\nstudy of the region including PSR J1826-1256 reveals an elongated non-thermal\nX-ray emitting nebula with the pulsar located in the northern border and a tail\ntowards the peak of the very high energy source. The spectrum is characterized\nby a power law with a photon index going from 1.6 around the pulsar to 2.7 in\nthe borders of the nebula, a behaviour consistent with synchrotron cooling of\nelectrons.

The design of open-loop minimum-energy\ncontrol inputs to steer a linear system between two different states in finite\ntime is a classic problem in control theory, whose solution can be computed in\nclosed form using the system matrices and its controllability Gramian. Yet, the\ncomputation of these inputs is known to be ill-conditioned, especially when the\nsystem is large, the control horizon long, and the system model uncertain. Due\nto these limitations, open-loop minimum-energy controls and the associated\nstate trajectories have remained primarily of theoretical value. Surprisingly,\nin this paper we show that open-loop minimum-energy controls can be learned\nexactly from experimental data, with a finite number of control experiments\nover the same time horizon, without knowledge or estimation of the system\nmodel, and with an algorithm that is significantly more reliable than the\ndirect model-based computation. These findings promote a new philosophy of\ncontrolling large, uncertain, linear systems where data is abundantly\navailable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 15:19:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 18:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

Modern stochastic approaches to searching for\nthese configurations depend on the optimisation of structures to nearby local\nminima in the energy landscape. In many cases these local minima are relatively\nhigh in energy, and inspection reveals that they are trapped, tangled, or\notherwise frustrated in their descent to a lower energy configuration.\nStrategies have been developed which attempt to overcome these traps, such as\nclassical and quantum annealing, basin/minima hopping, evolutionary algorithms\nand swarm based methods. Random structure search makes no attempt to avoid the\nlocal minima, and benefits from a broad and uncorrelated sampling of\nconfiguration space. It has been particularly successful in the first\nprinciples prediction of unexpected new phases of dense matter. Here it is\ndemonstrated that by starting the structural optimisations in a higher\ndimensional space, or hyperspace, many of the traps can be avoided, and that\nthe probability of reaching low energy configurations is much enhanced.\nExcursions into the extra dimensions are progressively eliminated through the\napplication of a growing energetic penalty. This approach is tested on hard\ncases for random search - clusters, compounds, and covalently bonded networks.\nThe improvements observed are most dramatic for the most difficult ones. Random\nstructure search is shown to be typically accelerated by two orders of\nmagnitude, and more for particularly challenging systems. This increase in\nperformance is expected to benefit all approaches to structure prediction that\nrely on the local optimisation of stochastically generated structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 15:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-07"}

Though they have\nzero Lyapunov exponent their classical and quantum properties are involved due\nto scattering on singular vertices. It is demonstrated that in the\nsemiclassical limit multiple singular scattering on such vertices when optical\nboundaries of many scatters overlap leads to vanishing of quantum wave\nfunctions along straight lines built by these scatters. This phenomenon has an\nespecially important consequence for polygonal billiards where periodic orbits\n(when they exist) form pencils of parallel rays restricted from the both sides\nby singular vertices. Due to singular scattering on boundary vertices, waves\npropagated inside periodic orbit pencils in the semiclassical limit tend to\nzero along pencil boundaries thus forming weakly interacting quasi-modes.\nContrary to scars in chaotic systems the discussed quasi-modes in polygonal\nbilliards become almost exact for high-excited states and for brevity they are\ndesignated as superscars. Many pictures of eigenfunctions for a triangular\nbilliard and a barrier billiard which have clear superscar structures are\npresented in the paper. Special attention is given to the development of\nquantitative methods of detecting and analysing such superscars. In particular,\nit is demonstrated that the overlap between superscar waves associated with a\nfixed periodic orbit and eigenfunctions of a barrier billiard is distributed\naccording to the Breit-Wigner distribution typical for weakly interacting\nquasi-modes (or doorway states). For special sub-class of rational polygonal\nbilliards called Veech polygons where all periodic orbits can be calculated\nanalytically it is argued and checked numerically that their eigenfunctions are\nfractal in the Fourier space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Feb 2019 16:05:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-07"}

Because of\nthis, it is difficult to determine the daily food demand, and this causes cost,\ntime and labor loss for the institutions. Statistical or heuristic methods are\nused to remove or at least minimize these losses. In this study, an artificial\nintelligence model was proposed, which estimates the daily food demand quantity\nusing artificial neural networks for businesses.

Among other consequences, this introduces a level\nof sensitivity to the amplitude fluctuations and average relative phase. By\nmeans of simulations of Roessler systems and experiments on single-transistor\noscillator networks, it is shown that the resulting coherence measure may have\nan empirical value in improving the inference of the structural couplings from\nthe dynamics.

We formulate our problem under the\ntheory of Green and Naghdi of type-III (GN-III) to account for the interactions\nbetween the elastic, thermal as well as magnetic fields. A general dispersion\nrelation for coupled waves is deduced to ascertain the nature of waves\npropagating through the medium. Perturbation technique has been employed to\nobtain the solution of dispersion relation for small thermo-elastic coupling\nparameter and identify three different types of waves. We specially analyze the\nnature of important wave components like, phase velocity, specific loss and\npenetration depth of all three modes of waves. We attempt to compute these wave\ncomponents numerically to observe their variations with frequency. The effect\nof presence of magnetic field is analyzed. Comparative results under theories\nof type GN-I, II and III have been presented numerically in which we have found\nthat the coupled thermoelastic waves are un-attenuated and nondispersive in\ncase of Green-Naghdi-II model which is completely in contrast with the theories\nof type-I and type-III. Furthermore, the thermal mode wave is observed to\npropagate with finite phase velocity in case of GN-II model, whereas the phase\nvelocity of thermal mode wave is found to be an increasing function of\nfrequency in other two cases. We achieve significant variations among the\nresults predicted by all three theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 08:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}
