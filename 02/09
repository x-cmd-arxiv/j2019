This study shows that pressure induced H-H interactions can occur\nin metal hydrides at much lower compression and larger H-H distances than\npreviously thought and stimulates an alternative pathway in the search for\nnovel high-temperature superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 16:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

Using Laue3DND,\nwe were able to retrieve the position and orientation of 97 out of 100 grains\nfrom a synthetic{\\alpha}-Fe data set, as well as 24 and 9 grains respectively\nfrom the{\\alpha}-Fe and YBaCuFeO5 sample measured at FALCON. Results from the\nsynthetic tests also indicate that Laue3DND is capable of indexing 10 out of 10\ngrains for both symmetries in two extreme scenarios: using only 6 Laue\nprojections and using 360 projections with extremely noisy data. The precision\nachieved in terms of spatial and orientation resolution for the current version\nof the method is 430{\\mu}m and 1 degree respectively. Based on these results\nobtained, we are confident to present a tool that expands the capabilities of\nstandard Laue diffraction, providing the number, position, orientation and\nrelative size of grains in oligocrystalline samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 17:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-11"}

Abundance enhancements of elements with 2 <= Z <= 56, relative to\ncoronal abundances, show a power-law dependence, versus their average\nmass-to-charge ratio A/Q, that varies from event to event and with time during\nevents. The ion charge states Q depend upon the source plasma temperature T.\nFor most gradual SEP events, shock waves have accelerated ambient coronal\nmaterial with T < 2 MK with decreasing power-laws in A/Q. In this case, the\nproton abundances agree rather well with the power-law fits extrapolated from\nelements with Z >= 6 at A/Q > 2 down to hydrogen at A/Q = 1. Thus the\nabundances of the elements with Z >= 6 fairly accurately predict the observed\nabundance of H, at a similar velocity, in most SEP events. However, for those\ngradual SEP events where ion enhancements follow positive powers of A/Q,\nespecially those with T > 2 MK where shock waves have reaccelerated residual\nsuprathermal ions from previous impulsive SEP events, proton abundances\ncommonly exceed the extrapolated expectation, usually by a factor of order ten.\nThis is a new and unexpected pattern of behavior that is unique to the\nabundances of protons and may be related to the need for more streaming protons\nto produce sufficient waves for scattering and acceleration of more heavy ions\nat the shock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 17:59:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 May 2019 16:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}

In heavy fermion systems\nsuch localization is prototypically present only at liquid helium temperatures.\nIn these $f$-electron Kondo systems, conduction electrons magnetically couple\nto localized moments, enhancing their mass and scatting time. These\nquasiparticles may form Cooper pairs and cause unconventional superconductivity\nwith a critical temperature $T_c$ of the order of the Fermi energy\n$\\varepsilon_F$. In relative terms, this $T_c$ is much larger than in cuprate\nor BCS superconductors for which $T_c\\ll \\varepsilon_F$.

For this to occur, strong correlations that cause electron\nlocalization need to take place at much larger temperatures. Here we show that\nmetal hydrides manifest strong electron correlations in a single $3d_{x^2-y^2}$\nband at the Fermi level, similar to the cuprates but at room temperature.

The discovery\nof new classes of Weyl materials is driving the search for novel properties\nthat derive directly from the Berry charge. The circular photogalvanic effect\n(CPGE), whereby circular polarized light generates a current whose direction\ndepends on the helicity of the absorbed photons, is a striking example of a\nmacroscopic property that emerges from Weyl topology. Recently, it was\npredicted that the rate of current generation associated with optical\ntransitions near a Weyl node is proportional to its monopole charge and\nindependent of material-specific parameters. In Weyl semimetals that retain\nmirror symmetry this universal photogalvanic current is strongly suppressed by\nopposing contributions from energy equivalent nodes of opposite charge.\nHowever, when all mirror symmetries are broken, as in chiral Weyl systems,\nnodes with opposite topological charge are no longer degenerate, opening a\nwindow of photon energies where the topological CPGE can emerge. In this work\nwe test this theory through measurement of the photon-energy dependence of the\nCPGE in the chiral Weyl semimetal RhSi.

However, despite their physical and economic couplings, these networks\nare still operated independently, with asynchronous market mechanisms. This\nmode of operation may lead to significant economic and reliability risks in\ncongested environments as revealed by the 2014 polar vortex event experienced\nby the northeastern United States. To mitigate these risks, while preserving\nthe current structure of the markets, this paper explores the idea of\nintroducing gas network awareness into the standard unit commitment model.\nUnder the assumption that the power system operator has some (or full)\nknowledge of gas demand forecast and the gas network, the paper proposes a\ntri-level mathematical program where natural gas zonal prices are given by the\ndual solutions of natural-gas flux conservation constraints and commitment\ndecisions are subject to bid-validity constraints that ensure the economic\nviability of the committed GFPPs.

The approach is validated on a case\nstudy for the Northeastern United States [1] that can reproduce the gas and\nelectricity price spikes experienced during the early winter of 2014. The\nresults on the case study demonstrate that gas awareness in unit commitment is\ninstrumental in avoiding the peaks in electricity prices while keeping the gas\nprices to reasonable levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 18:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-11"}

We find that the total number of BHs increases significantly in this\nregion due to this process for lower mass SMBHs by up to a factor of 5, but\nthere is no increase in the vicinity of the highest mass SMBHs. Due to the high\nBH number density in the NSC, BH-BH binaries form during close approaches due\nto GW emission. We update the previous estimate of O'Leary et al. for the rate\nof such GW capture events by estimating the $\\langle n^2\\rangle/\\langle\nn\\rangle^2$ parameter where $n$ is the number density. We find a BH merger rate\nfor this channel to be in the range $\\sim0.01-0.1 \\, \\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$.\nThe total merger rate is dominated by the smallest galaxies hosting SMBHs, and\nthe number of heaviest BHs in the NSC.

Thanks to the extensive multi-wavelength photometry available in\nthe COSMOS field, we derive AGN luminosities, host stellar masses, and star\nformation rates (SFRs) via a multi-component SED fitting technique. Type 1 and\nType 2 AGNs follow the same intrinsic Lx-L6um relation, suggesting that\nmid-infrared emission is a reasonably good measure of the AGN accretion power\nregardless of obscuration.

The AGN luminosity and SFR are\nconsistent with an increase toward high stellar mass, while both the\nMstellar-dependence is weaker towards the high-mass end, which could be\ninterpreted as a consequence of quenching both star formation and AGN activity\nin massive galaxies. AGN host galaxies tend to have SFRs that are consistent\nwith normal star-forming galaxies, independent of AGN luminosities.

Unlike typical\nautoregressive models which rely on a fixed, often left-to-right ordering of\nthe output, our approach accommodates arbitrary orderings by allowing for\ntokens to be inserted anywhere in the sequence during decoding. This\nflexibility confers a number of advantages: for instance, not only can our\nmodel be trained to follow specific orderings such as left-to-right generation\nor a binary tree traversal, but it can also be trained to maximize entropy over\nall valid insertions for robustness. In addition, our model seamlessly\naccommodates both fully autoregressive generation (one insertion at a time) and\npartially autoregressive generation (simultaneous insertions at multiple\nlocations).

The proposed method reduces the number of parameters of each\nconvolutional layer by learning a 1D vector termed Filter Summary (FS). The\nconvolutional filters are located in FS as overlapping 1D segments, and nearby\nfilters in FS share weights in their overlapping regions in a natural way. The\nresultant neural network based on such weight sharing scheme, termed Filter\nSummary CNNs or FSNet, has a FS in each convolution layer instead of a set of\nindependent filters in the conventional convolution layer. FSNet has the same\narchitecture as that of the baseline CNN to be compressed, and each convolution\nlayer of FSNet has the same number of filters from FS as that of the basline\nCNN in the forward process. With compelling computational acceleration ratio,\nthe parameter space of FSNet is much smaller than that of the baseline CNN. In\naddition, FSNet is quantization friendly. FSNet with weight quantization leads\nto even higher compression ratio without noticeable performance loss. We\nfurther propose Differentiable FSNet where the way filters share weights is\nlearned in a differentiable and end-to-end manner.

Unlike the case of regression, where cross-validation of the\nprediction error is a widespread and trusted approach for model selection,\nthere are no tools for PCA model selection which reach this level of\nacceptance. In this work, we address this challenge and evaluate the utility of\nthe cross-validated ignorance score with both simulated and experimental data\nsets. Application of this method is based on the interpretation of PCA as a\ndensity model, as in probabilistic principal component analysis, and is shown\nto be a valuable tool to identify an optimal number of principal components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2019 21:17:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

In this context, functional climate\nnetworks can be constructed using a spatiotemporal climate dataset and a\nsuitable time series distance function. The resulting coarse-grained view on\nclimate variability consists of representing distinct areas on the globe (i.e.,\ngrid cells) by nodes and connecting pairs of nodes that present similar time\nseries. One fundamental concern when constructing such a functional climate\nnetwork is the definition of a metric that captures the mutual similarity\nbetween time series. Here we study systematically the effect of 29 time series\ndistance functions on functional climate network construction based on global\ntemperature data. We observe that the distance functions previously used in the\nliterature commonly generate very similar networks while alternative ones\nresult in rather distinct network structures and reveal different long-distance\nconnection patterns. These patterns are highly important for the study of\nclimate dynamics since they generally represent pathways for the long-distance\ntransportation of energy and can be used to forecast climate variability on\nsubseasonal to interannual or even decadal scales.

A thin domain in three\ndimensional Euclidean space is roughly a small neighborhood of regular enough\ntwo dimensional compact surface. We prove an asymptotically sharp geometric\nrigidity interpolation inequality for thin domains with little regularity. In\ncontrast to that celebrated Friesecke-James-M\\\"uller rigidity estimate\n[\\textit{Comm. Pure Appl. Math.,} 55(11):1461-1506, 2002] for plates, our\nestimate holds for any proper rotations $\\BR\\in SO(3).$ Namely, the estimate\nbounds the $L^p$ distance of the gradient of any $\\By\\in W^{1,p}(\\Omega,\\mathbb\nR^3)$ field from any constant proper rotation $\\BR\\in SO(3)$, in terms of the\naverage $L^p$ distance (nonlinear strain) of the gradient $\\nabla\\By$ from the\nrotation group $SO(3)$, and the average $L^p$ distance of the field itself from\nthe set of rigid motions corresponding to the rotation $\\BR$. There are several\nremarkable facts about the estimate: 1. The constants in the estimate are sharp\nin terms of the domain thickness scaling for any thin domains with the required\nregularity. 2. In the special cases when the domain has positive or negative\nGaussian curvature, the inequality reduces the problem of estimating the\ngradient $\\nabla\\By$ in terms of the prototypical nonlinear strain\n$\\int_\\Omega\\mathrm{dist}^p(\\nabla\\By(x),SO(3))dx$ to the easier problem of\nestimating only the vector field $\\By$ in terms of the nonlinear strain without\nany loss in the constant scalings as the Ans\\\"atze suggest.

Here, we systematically tune the chirality of the\nbackground membrane, and find that in the achiral limit colloidal rafts acquire\nfundamentally new structural properties and interactions. In particular, rafts\ncan switch between two chiral states of opposite handedness, which dramatically\nalters the nature of the membrane-mediated raft-raft interactions. Rafts with\nthe same chirality have long-ranged repulsions, while those with opposite\nchirality acquire attractions with a well-defined minimum. Both attractive and\nrepulsive interactions are explained by a continuum model that accounts for the\ncoupling between the membrane thickness and the local tilt of the constituent\nrods. These switchable interactions enable assembly of colloidal rafts into\nintricate higher-order architectures with unusual symmetries, including stable\ntetrameric clusters and \"ionic crystallites\" of counter-twisting domains\norganized on a binary square lattice. Furthermore, the properties of individual\nrafts, such as their sizes, are controlled by their complexation with other\nrafts. The emergence of these complex behaviors can be rationalized purely in\nterms of generic couplings between compositional and orientational order of\nfluids of rod-like elements. Thus, the uncovered principles might have\nrelevance for conventional lipid bilayers, in which the assembly of\nhigher-order structures is also mediated by complex membrane-mediated\ninteractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Feb 2019 00:45:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

A proper patient similarity\nmeasure enables various downstream applications, such as cohort study and\ntreatment comparative effectiveness research. One major carrier for conducting\npatient similarity research is Electronic Health Records(EHRs), which are\nusually heterogeneous, longitudinal, and sparse. Though existing studies on\nlearning patient similarity from EHRs have shown being useful in solving real\nclinical problems, their applicability is limited due to the lack of medical\ninterpretations. Moreover, most previous methods assume a vector-based\nrepresentation for patients, which typically requires aggregation of medical\nevents over a certain time period.

While a\n$2$ approximation was known before, the running time of the algorithm is at\nleast $\\Omega(n^{256})$ in the worst case. Therefore, an $O(n)$ algorithm is\nsurprising and the best possible. We archive this result by calling an AEPTAS\nwith approximation guarantee $(1+\\varepsilon)OPT +p_{\\max}$ and running time of\nthe form $O(n\\log(1/\\varepsilon)+ f(1/\\varepsilon))$ with a constant\n$\\varepsilon$ to schedule the jobs on a single cluster.

In this paper we investigate how, in a fully connected social\nnetwork, connectivity dynamics, alone and in interaction with different\ncognitive biases, affect the evolution of cultural variants. Using agent-based\ncomputer simulations, we manipulate population connectivity dynamics (early,\nmiddle and late full-population connectivity); content bias, or a preference\nfor high-quality variants; coordination bias, or whether agents tend to use\nself-produced variants (egocentric bias), or to switch to variants observed in\nothers (allocentric bias); and memory size, or the number of items that agents\ncan store in their memory. We show that connectivity dynamics affect the\ntime-course of variant spread, with lower connectivity slowing down convergence\nof the population onto a single cultural variant. We also show that, compared\nto a neutral evolutionary model, content bias accelerates convergence and\namplifies the effects of connectivity dynamics, whilst larger memory size and\ncoordination bias, especially egocentric bias, slow down convergence.\nFurthermore, connectivity dynamics affect the frequency of high quality\nvariants (adaptiveness), with late connectivity populations showing bursts of\nrapid change in adaptiveness followed by periods of relatively slower change,\nand early connectivity populations following a single-peak evolutionary\ndynamic.

One reason for the reticence in its usage for conventional\nquantum instruction is that the approach for simple problems like the\nparticle-in-a-box is much more complicated than the differential equation\napproach, making it appear to be less useful for pedagogy. We argue that the\napproach is still quite attractive because it employs only algebraic methods,\nand thereby has a much lower level of math background needed to use it. We show\nhow Schroedinger's operator method can be streamlined for these\nparticle-in-a-box problems greatly reducing the complexity of the solution and\nmaking it much more accessible. As an application, we illustrate how this\napproach can be used to prove an important result, the existence of bound\nstates for one- and two-dimensional attractive potentials, using only algebraic\nmethods. The approach developed here can be employed in undergraduate classes\nand possibly even high school classes because it employs only algebra and\nrequires essentially no calculus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Feb 2019 01:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}
