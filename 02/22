Key points in these calculations, which are\nhandled differently by the various codes, are the sharing of the total\nexcitation energy between the fragments and the generation of angular momenta.\nAfter the initial states of the fragments is set, the de-excitation through the\nemission of neutrons and photons can be model. However, many models also\ninclude tunable parameters that are used to make the calculations conform with\nliterature data. As a result, it could be possible to obtain good agreement\nwith experimental results even with questionable assumptions on the initial\nconditions. To test the assumptions made by different fission models the code\nDE$\\ell$FIN has been developed. DE$\\ell$FIN starts with the fission fragments\nas generated by the models and calculates the average neutron emission as a\nfunction of mass in a transparent and coherent way using the nuclear reaction\ncode TALYS. Hence, the probabilities of neutron emission in competition with\n$\\gamma$ de-excitation comes from parameters of the TALYS code that have not\nbeen optimised. The results are then compared looking at general trends and at\nthe difference to what is obtained with the stand-alone versions of the codes.\nIn this study, the output of DE$\\ell$FIN for five of the most commonly used\nfission codes is compared to the results of the stand-alone versions, and to\nexperimental data, for the reactions $^{235}$U(n$_{\\mathrm{th}}$,f),\n$^{239}$Pu(n$_{\\mathrm{th}}$,f) and $^{252}$Cf(sf).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 16:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-22"}

For example, surveillance face\nimages (typically acquired in the visible spectrum, VIS) may need to be\ncompared against a legacy iris database (typically acquired in near-infrared,\nNIR).

Using photometric and geometric criteria, we identified\npairs of candidates of lensed galaxies (LGCs) in the \"string field\" (SF), which\nwere then compared with the average density of background galaxy pairs in a set\nof \"control fields\" (CFs).

Our analysis used predictions of N-body\nsimulations to estimate the initial number of stars of the remnants from their\ndissolution timescales. The investigated open cluster remnants present masses\nand velocity dispersions within well-defined ranges: M between ~10-40M_Sun and\nsigma_v between ~1-7km/s. Some objects in the remnant sample have a limiting\nradius R_lim<~2pc, which means that they are more compact than the investigated\nopen clusters; other remnants have R_lim between ~2-7pc, which is comparable to\nthe open clusters. We suggest that the open cluster NGC2180 is entering a\nremnant evolutionary stage. In general, our clusters show signals of depletion\nof low-mass stars.

Optimization is\ntraditionally automated with digital or quantum computers, each having their\nlimitations and none guaranteeing an optimal solution. Here, we conceive a\nprinciple behind optimization based on delay-induced bifurcations, which is\npotentially implementable in non-quantum analog devices. Often, optimization\ntechniques are interpreted via a particle moving in multi-well energy landscape\nand to prevent confinement to a non-global minima they should incorporate\nmechanisms to overcome barriers between the minima. Particularly, simulated\nannealing digitally emulates pushing a fictitious particle over a barrier by\nrandom noise, whereas quantum computers utilize tunneling through barriers. In\nour principle, the barriers are effectively destroyed by delay-induced\nbifurcations. Although bifurcation scenarios in nonlinear delay-differential\nequations can be very complex and are notoriously difficult to predict, we\nhypothesize, verify, and utilize the finding that they become considerably more\npredictable in dynamical systems, where the right-hand side depends only on the\ndelayed variable and represents a gradient of some potential energy function.\nBy tuning the delay introduced into the gradient descent setting, thanks to\nglobal bifurcations destroying local attractors, one could force the system to\nspontaneously wander around all minima. This would be similar to noise-induced\nbehavior in simulated annealing but achieved deterministically. Ideally, a slow\nincrease and then decrease of the delay should automatically push the system\ntoward the global minimum. We explore the possibility of this scenario and\nformulate some prerequisites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 00:07:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 14:01:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 19:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

The best probe to observationally\nmeasure both the morphology and the strength of this magnetic field at scales\nof 10-100 au is maser polarization. We measure the direction of magnetic fields\nat mas resolution around a sample of massive star-forming regions to determine\nwhether there is a relation between the orientation of the magnetic field and\nof the outflows. In addition, by estimating the magnetic field strength via the\nZeeman splitting measurements, the role of magnetic field in the dynamics of\nthe massive star-forming region is investigated. We selected a flux-limited\nsample of 31 massive star-forming regions to perform a statistical analysis of\nthe magnetic field properties with respect to the molecular outflows\ncharacteristics. We report the linearly and circularly polarized emission of\n6.7 GHz CH3OH masers towards seven massive star-forming regions of the total\nsample with the EVN.

The model allows us to\nseparate the effects of tropospheric lapse rate (TLR), optical depth, outgoing\nlongwave radiation (OLR) and stratospheric cooling on the tropopause height.\nWhen applied locally at each latitudinal band the model predicts the overall\nmeridional structure of the tropopause height, with a tropical tropopause\nsubstantially higher than that in higher latitudes and a sharp transition at\nthe edge of the extratropics. The large optical depth of the tropics, due\nmainly to the large water vapour path (WVP), is the dominant tropospheric\neffect producing the higher tropical tropopause, whereas the larger tropical\nlapse rate acts to lower the tropopause height. The dynamical cooling induced\nby the stratospheric circulation further lifts the thermal tropopause in the\ntropics resulting in it being significantly cooler and higher than in mid- and\nhigh latitudes. The model quantifies the causes of the tropopause height\nincrease with global warming that is robustly found in climate integrations\nfrom the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The large spread\nin the increase rate of tropopause height in the CMIP5 models is captured by\nthe simple model, which attributes the dominant contributions to changes in WVP\nand TLR, with changes in CO2 concentration and OLR having much smaller effects.\nThe CMIP5 models also show a small but robust increase in the tropopause\ntemperature in low latitudes, with a much smaller increase in higher latitudes.\nWe suggest that the tropical increase may in part be caused by non-grey effects\nin the radiative transfer associated with the higher levels of water vapour in\nthe tropics, with near constant tropopause temperatures predicted otherwise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 19:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

However,\nSOT algorithms are generally designed for distinguishing a target from its\nenvironment, and hence meet problems when a target is spatially mixed with\nsimilar objects as observed frequently in MOT. To address this issue, in this\npaper we propose an instance-aware tracker to integrate SOT techniques for MOT\nby encoding awareness both within and between target models. In particular, we\nconstruct each target model by fusing information for distinguishing target\nboth from background and other instances (tracking targets). To conserve\nuniqueness of all target models, our instance-aware tracker considers response\nmaps from all target models and assigns spatial locations exclusively to\noptimize the overall accuracy. Another contribution we make is a dynamic model\nrefreshing strategy learned by a convolutional neural network. This strategy\nhelps to eliminate initialization noise as well as to adapt to the variation of\ntarget size and appearance. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach,\nit is evaluated on the popular MOT15 and MOT16 challenge benchmarks. On both\nbenchmarks, our approach achieves the best overall performances in comparison\nwith published results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 19:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-25"}

Numerical simulations show that essentially two\naccumulation regimes are identified: for low and for high flow velocities. When\nparticles accumulate in high-velocity regions, at the entrance of a pore\nthroat, a clog is formed. The formation of a clog significantly modifies the\nflow, as the partial blockage of the pore causes a local redistribution of\npressure. This redistribution can divert the upstream water flow into\nneighbouring pores.

To address\nsuch challenges, we established a pipeline that co-learns from detailed\nclinical demographics and 3D CT images. Toward this end, we leveraged data from\nthe Consortium for Molecular and Cellular Characterization of Screen-Detected\nLesions (MCL), which focuses on early detection of lung cancer.

To address this, we present a Deep Fully\nConvolutional Neural Network (DFCN) that is comprehensive in its use of\ninterferometric data, where both amplitude and phase information are used\njointly for identifying RFI. We train the network using simulated HERA\nvisibilities containing mock RFI, yielding a known \"ground truth\" dataset for\nevaluating the accuracy of various RFI algorithms. Evaluation of the DFCN model\nis performed on observations from the 67 dish build-out, HERA-67, and achieves\na data throughput of 1.6$\\times 10^{5}$ HERA time-ordered 1024 channeled\nvisibilities per hour per GPU. We determine that relative to an amplitude only\nnetwork including visibility phase adds important adjacent time-frequency\ncontext which increases discrimination between RFI and Non-RFI. The inclusion\nof phase when predicting achieves a Recall of 0.81, Precision of 0.58, and\n$F_{2}$ score of 0.75 as applied to our HERA-67 observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 20:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

These problems are multidisciplinary, complex, and\nrequire collaboration. This is especially true at the base scientific level\nwhere the underlying physical equations need to be solved, and data, associated\nwith physical experiments, need to be inverted. In this paper, we present\narguments for adopting an open-source methodology for geophysics and provide\nsome background about open-source software for electromagnetics. Immediate\nbenefits are the reduced time required to carry out research, being able to\ncollaborate, having reproducible results, and being able to disseminate results\nquickly. To illustrate the use of an open-source methodology in\nelectromagnetics, we present two challenges. The first is to simulate data from\na time domain airborne system over a conductive plate buried in a more\nresistive earth. The second is to jointly invert airborne TDEM and FDEM data\nwith ground TDEM. SimPEG, Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics,\n(https://simpeg.xyz) is used for the open-source software. The figures in this\npaper can be reproduced by downloading the Jupyter Notebooks we provide with\nthis paper (https://github.com/simpeg-research/oldenburg-2018-AEM). Access to\nthe source code allows the researcher to explore the simulations and inversions\nby changing model and inversion parameters, plot fields and fluxes to gain\nfurther insight about the EM phenomena, and solve a new research problem by\nusing open-source software as a base. By providing results in a manner that\nallows others to reproduce, further explore, and even extend them, we hope to\ndemonstrate that an open-source paradigm has the potential to enable more rapid\nprogress of the geophysics community as a whole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 20:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

This is particularly important for monitoring\ndegenerative condition such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), where the condition of\nthe patient will decay over time. Detecting early symptoms and progression\nsign, and continuous severity evaluation, are all essential for disease\nmanagement. While a few methods have been developed in the literature,\nuncertainty quantification of those health index models has been largely\nneglected. To ensure the continuity of the care, we should be more explicit\nabout the level of confidence in model outputs. Ideally, decision-makers should\nbe provided with recommendations that are robust in the face of substantial\nuncertainty about future outcomes. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by\ndeveloping an uncertainty quantification based contemporaneous longitudinal\nindex, named UQ-CHI, with a particular focus on continuous patient monitoring\nof degenerative conditions. Our method is to combine convex optimization and\nBayesian learning using the maximum entropy learning (MEL) framework,\nintegrating uncertainty on labels as well. Our methodology also provides\nclosed-form solutions in some important decision making tasks, e.g., such as\npredicting the label of a new sample. Numerical studies demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the propose UQ-CHI method in prediction accuracy, monitoring\nefficacy, and unique advantages if uncertainty quantification is enabled\npractice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 20:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-25"}

The study\nis motivated by the fact that falling graupels in clouds are heated by the\nlatent heat released during the accretion of liquid water droplets. They may\ntherefore be considerably warmer than their surrounding and evaporate water\nvapor, which mixes with the surrounding air in the wake of the graupel, thereby\ncreating transient zones of supersaturation there. The problem of a falling\ngraupel is modeled as that of a heated sphere falling in a quiescent ambient\nfluid under the action of gravity. The coupling between the temperature and\nvelocity fields is accounted for by the Boussinesq approximation. This problem\ncan be parameterized by four parameters: the particle/fluid density ratio, the\nGalileo number, the Prandtl number, and the Richardson number. A separate\nscalar transport equation accounts for the vapor transport. Typical cloud\nconditions involve small temperature differences between the sphere and the\nsurrounding, yielding relatively small Richardson numbers for both heat and\nmass transport.

We first prove that our framework results in images\nthat are unattainable by attack styles in isolation. We then perform\nadversarial training using attacks generated by our framework to demonstrate\nthat networks are only robust to classes of adversarial perturbations they have\nbeen trained against, and combination attacks are stronger than any of their\nindividual components. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that our combined\nattacks retain the same perceptual distortion but induce far higher\nmisclassification rates when compared against individual attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 21:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-25"}

However, when considering\nmassive graphs containing millions or even billions of nodes not only the input\ngraph, but also the output spanner might be too large for a single processor to\nstore.\n  To tackle this challenge, we initiate the study of local computation\nalgorithms (LCAs) for graph spanners in general graphs, where the algorithm\nshould locally decide whether a given edge $(u,v) \\in E$ belongs to the output\nspanner. Such LCAs give the user the `illusion' that a specific sparse spanner\nfor the graph is maintained, without ever fully computing it. We present the\nfollowing results:\n  -For general $n$-vertex graphs and $r \\in \\{2,3\\}$, there exists an LCA for\n$(2r-1)$-spanners with $\\widetilde{O}(n^{1+1/r})$ edges and sublinear probe\ncomplexity of $\\widetilde{O}(n^{1-1/2r})$.

This improves upon, and extends the work of\n[Lenzen-Levi, 2018].\n  We also complement our results by providing a polynomial lower bound on the\nprobe complexity of LCAs for graph spanners that holds even for the simpler\ntask of computing a sparse connected subgraph with $o(m)$ edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 21:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-25"}

Using analytic models for the cluster\nprofile, we develop a halo model formalism to study this cross-correlation and\napply it to forecast the signal-to-noise of upcoming measurements from eROSITA\nand the Simons Observatory. In the soft X-ray band (0.5--2 keV), we forecast a\nsignal-to-noise of 174 for the cross-power spectrum. Over a wide range of the\nscales, the X-rays will be signal-dominated, and so sample variance is\nimportant.

One of the difficulties with modeling\nspatial processes that change in time is the complexity of the dependence\nstructures that must describe how such a process varies, and the presence of\nhigh-dimensional complex data sets and large prediction domains. It is\nparticularly challenging to specify parameterizations for nonlinear dynamic\nspatio-temporal models (DSTMs) that are simultaneously useful scientifically\nand efficient computationally. Statisticians have developed deep hierarchical\nmodels that can accommodate process complexity as well as the uncertainties in\nthe predictions and inference.

All the ULIRGs in our sample\nexhibit a ratio of optical depth of H2O ice to silicate dust (tau3.0/tau9.7)\nthat is lower than that in the Taurus dark cloud. This implies that ULIRGs\ncannot be described as an ensemble of low-mass star-forming regions and that a\nsignificant amount of high-mass star-forming regions contribute to star-forming\nclouds in local ULIRGs. The results also show that the ratios of optical depth\nof aliphatic carbon to silicate dust, tau3.4/tau9.7, exhibit diverse values. We\ninvestigate two effects that can affect this ratio: the geometric temperature\ngradient (which increases the ratio) and the intense UV environment (which\ndecreases it). The geometric temperature gradient is typically considered as a\nsign of active galactic nuclei (AGN). ULIRGs with AGN signs (optical\nclassification, NIR color, and a PAH emission strength of 3.3 um) indeed tend\nto exhibit a large tau3.4/tau9.7 ratio. However, we find that the presence of\nburied AGN is not the only cause of the geometric temperature gradient, because\nthe enhancement of the ratio is also evident in pure starburst-like ULIRGs\nwithout these AGN signs. Regarding the intense UV environment in star-forming\nregions, the correlation between the aliphatic carbon ratio and the ratio of\nthe [C II] 158 um line luminosity to the far-infrared luminosity (L[CII]/LFIR),\nwhich represents the UV environment in photodissociation regions, implies that\nthe intense UV environment causes the decrease of the aliphatic carbon ratio.\nWe find that an intense UV environment (G/nH > 3) in star-forming regions is\nneeded for the aliphatic carbon ratio to be suppressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 01:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-25"}

Motivated\nby the excellent performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in processing\ntime series, in this paper, we propose a novel Encoder-LSTM-Decoder (E-LSTM-D)\ndeep learning model to predict dynamic links end to end. It could handle long\nterm prediction problems, and suits the networks of different scales with\nfine-tuned structure. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that\nLSTM, together with an encoder-decoder architecture, is applied to link\nprediction in dynamic networks. This new model is able to automatically learn\nstructural and temporal features in a unified framework, which can predict the\nlinks that never appear in the network before.

It\nwell balances the demand for sufficient beamforming gains to overcome the\npropagation loss and the desire to reduce the hardware cost and power\nconsumption. In this paper, the mean square error (MSE) is chosen as the\nperformance metric to characterize the transmission reliability. Using the\nminimum sum-MSE criterion, we investigate the HBF design for broadband mmWave\ntransmissions. To overcome the difficulty of solving the multi-variable design\nproblem, the alternating minimization method is adopted to optimize the hybrid\ntransmit and receive beamformers alternatively. Specifically, a manifold\noptimization based HBF algorithm is firstly proposed, which directly handles\nthe constant modulus constraint of the analog component. Its convergence is\nthen proved. To reduce the computational complexity, we then propose a\nlow-complexity general eigenvalue decomposition based HBF algorithm in the\nnarrowband scenario and three algorithms via the eigenvalue decomposition and\northogonal matching pursuit methods in the broadband scenario. A particular\ninnovation in our proposed alternating minimization algorithms is a carefully\ndesigned initialization method, which leads to faster convergence.\n{Furthermore, we extend the sum-MSE based design to that with weighted sum-MSE,\nwhich is then connected to the spectral efficiency based design.} Simulation\nresults show that the proposed HBF algorithms achieve significant performance\nimprovement over existing ones, and perform close to full-digital beamforming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 02:35:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-25"}

The Monitor of\nAll-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) detected XTE J1810-197 immediately after a November\n20-26 visibility gap, contemporaneous with its reactivation as a radio pulsar,\nfirst observed on December 8. On December 13 the Nuclear Spectroscopic\nTelescope Array (NUSTAR) detected X-ray emission up to at least 30 keV, with a\nspectrum well-characterized by a blackbody plus power-law model with\ntemperature kT = 0.74+/-0.02 keV and photon index Gamma = 4.4+/-0.2 or by a\ntwo-blackbody model with kT = 0.59+/-0.04 keV and kT = 1.0+/-0.1 keV, both\nincluding an additional power-law component to account for emission above 10\nkeV, with Gamma_h = -0.2+/-1.5 and Gamma_h = 1.5+/-0.5, respectively. The\nlatter index is consistent with hard X-ray flux reported for the non-transient\nmagnetars. In the 2-10 keV bandpass, the absorbed flux is 2E-10 erg/s/cm^2, a\nfactor of 2 greater than the maximum flux extrapolated for the 2003 outburst.\nThe peak of the sinusoidal X-ray pulse lags the radio pulse by approx. 0.13\ncycles, consistent with their phase relationship during the 2003 outburst. This\nsuggests a stable geometry in which radio emission originates on magnetic field\nlines containing currents that heat a spot on the neutron star surface.\nHowever, a measured energy-dependent phase shift of the pulsed X-rays suggests\nthat all X-ray emitting regions are not precisely co-aligned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 04:24:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 18:33:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

Our core principle is\nto use meta-gradients to solve the bilevel problem underlying training-time\nattacks, essentially treating the graph as a hyperparameter to optimize. Our\nexperiments show that small graph perturbations consistently lead to a strong\ndecrease in performance for graph convolutional networks, and even transfer to\nunsupervised embeddings. Remarkably, the perturbations created by our algorithm\ncan misguide the graph neural networks such that they perform worse than a\nsimple baseline that ignores all relational information. Our attacks do not\nassume any knowledge about or access to the target classifiers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 09:20:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-29"}

Recent wall concepts based on micro-architected\nsurfaces have been proposed to mitigate surface erosion and SEE. The idea\nbehind these designs is to take advantage of very-high surface-to-volume ratios\nto reduce SEE and ion erosion by internal trapping and redeposition. This has\nresulted in renewed interest to study electron-electron processes in relevant\nthruster wall materials. In this work, we present calculations of SEE yields in\nmicro-porous hexagonal BN surfaces using stochastic simulations of\nelectron-material interactions in discretized surface geometries. Our model\nconsists of two complementary parts. First we study SEE as a function of\nprimary electron energy and incidence angle in flat surfaces using Monte Carlo\nsimulations of electron multi-scattering processes. The results are then used\nto represent the response function of discrete surface elements to individual\nelectron rays generated using a ray-tracing Monte Carlo model. We find that\nmicro-porous surfaces result in SEE yield reductions of over 50% in the energy\nrange experienced in Hall thrusters. This points to the suitability of these\nmicro-architected surface concepts to mitigate SEE-related issues in compact\nelectric propulsion devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 09:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

In this paper, we analyse the\ndynamical large deviations of such models, starting from their microscopic\nversion, the chemical master equation. By taking a large-volume limit, we show\nthat those systems can be described by a path integral formalism over a\nLagrangian functional of concentrations and chemical fluxes. This Lagrangian is\ndual to a Hamiltonian, whose trajectories correspond to the most likely\nevolution of the system given its boundary conditions. The same can be done for\na system biased on time-averaged concentrations and currents, yielding a biased\nHamiltonian whose trajectories are optimal paths conditioned on those\nobservables. The appropriate boundary conditions turn out to be mixed, so that,\nin the long time limit, those trajectories converge to well-defined attractors.\nWe are then able to identify the largest value that the Hamiltonian takes over\nthose attractors with the scaled cumulant generating function of our\nobservables, providing a non-linear equivalent to the well-known\nDonsker-Varadhan formula for jump processes. On that basis, we prove that\nchemical reaction networks that are deterministically multistable generically\nundergo first-order dynamical phase transitions in the vicinity of zero bias.\nWe illustrate that fact through a simple bistable model called the Schl\\\"ogl\nmodel, as well as multistable and unstable generalisations of it, and we make a\nfew surprising observations regarding the stability of deterministic fixed\npoints, and the breaking of ergodicity in the large-volume limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 09:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Despite the model being quite\npopular, this is the first Bayesian implementation that allows a wide choice of\ndistances, and that works well with a large amount of items to be ranked.\nBayesMallows supports footrule, Spearman, Kendall, Cayley, Hamming and Ulam\ndistances, allowing full use of the rich expressiveness of the Mallows model.\nThis is possible thanks to the implementation of fast algorithms for\napproximating the partition function of the model under various distances.\nAlthough developed for being used in computing the posterior distribution of\nthe model, these algorithms may be of interest in their own right.\n  BayesMallows handles non-standard data: partial rankings and pairwise\ncomparisons, even in cases including non-transitive preference patterns. The\nadvantage of the Bayesian paradigm in this context comes from its ability to\ncoherently quantify posterior uncertainties of estimates of any quantity of\ninterest.

This\nincludes the study of the preceding confined C2.4 flare that occurred on the\nsame AR ~25 minutes earlier. We observed that the M9.0 flare occurred as a\nconsequence of two distinct triggering events well separated in time. The first\ntriggering episode occurred as early as ~20 minutes before the onset of the\nM9.0 flare, evidenced by the destabilization and rise of a pre-existing\nfilament to a new position of equilibrium at a higher coronal altitude during\nthe decay phase of the C2.4 flare. This brought the system to a magnetic\nconfiguration where the establishment of the second triggering event was\nfavorable. The second triggering episode occurred ~17 minutes later, during the\nearly phase of the M9.0 flare, evidenced by the further rise of the filament\nand successful ejection. The second trigger is followed by a flare precursor\nphase, characterized by non-thermal emission and the sequential formation of a\nhot channel as shown by the SDO/AIA DEM (differential emission measure) maps,\nthe RHESSI X-ray images and spectra. These observations are suggestive of\nmagnetic reconnection and particle acceleration that can explain the precursor\nphase and can be directly related to the formation of the hot channel.

These backreaction\nvariables can be modeled as an effective scalar field, called the `morphon\nfield'. The general cosmological equations still need a closure condition to be\nsolved. A simple example is the class of scaling solutions where $W_D$ and\n$Q_D$ are assumed to follow a power law of the volume scale factor $a_D$. But\nwhile they can describe models of quintessence, these and other models still\nassume the existence of dark matter in addition to the known sources. Going\nbeyond scaling solutions by using a model for structure formation that we argue\nis reasonably generic, we investigate the correspondence between the morphon\nfield and fundamental scalar field dark matter models, in order to describe\ndark matter as an effective phenomenon arising from kinematical backreaction\nand the averaged spatial curvature of the inhomogeneous Universe. While we find\nsignificant differences with those fundamental models, our main result is that\nthe energy budget on typical collapsing domains is provided by curvature and\nmatter in equal parts already around the turn-around time, leading to curvature\ndominance thereafter and increasing to a curvature contribution of $3/4$ of the\nenergy budget at the onset of virialization. Kinematical backreaction is\nsubdominant at early stages, but its importance rises quickly after turn-around\nand dominates the curvature contribution in the final phase of the collapse. We\nconclude that backreaction can indeed mimic dark matter (in the energy budget)\nduring the collapse phase of megaparsec-scale structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 11:29:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 18:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-12"}

The most\nsensitive searches for these sources are based on accurate matched filtering\ntechniques, that assume the continuous wave to be phase-locked with the pulsar\nbeamed emission. While matched filtering maximizes the search sensitivity, a\nsignificant signal-to-noise ratio loss will happen in case of a mismatch\nbetween the assumed and the true signal phase evolution. Narrow-band algorithms\nallow for a small mismatch in the frequency and spin-down values of the pulsar\nwhile integrating coherently the entire data set. In this paper we describe a\nnarrow-band search using LIGO O2 data for the continuous wave emission of 33\npulsars. No evidence for a continuous wave signal has been found and\nupper-limits on the gravitational wave amplitude, over the analyzed frequency\nand spin-down volume, have been computed for each of the targets.

This is mainly because of the rapid\nincrease in the number of wireless devices and data hungry applications\nper-device. This creates a formidable bandwidth crisis. Milimeter-wave (mmWave)\nsystems with massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) operation are two\ncomplementary concepts poised to meet this exploding demand, as verified by the\nwealth of investigations by both industry and academia. Nevertheless, existing\nMIMO processing techniques, requiring a dedicated radio-frequency (RF)\nup/down-conversion chain per antenna, results in prohibitively high complexity\nand cost of the mmWave prototypes. The primary objective of this paper is to\npresent a complete feasibility study on alternative beamforming techniques\ntargeted to reduce the system complexity without drastically compromising its\nperformance. More precisely, at 28 GHz, we investigate the end-to-end\nperformance of two different lens-based beamforming topologies.

In this paper, we do so, by exploiting a recently proposed\nmultiple-classifier architecture combining the improved security of 1-Class\n(1C) classification and the good performance ensured by conventional 2-Class\n(2C) classification in the absence of attacks. The architecture, also known as\n1.5-Class (1.5C) classifier, consists of one 2C classifier and two 1C\nclassifiers run in parallel followed by a final 1C classifier. In our system,\nthe first three classifiers are implemented by means of Support Vector Machines\n(SVM) fed with SPAM features. The outputs of such classifiers are then\nprocessed by a final 1C SVM in charge of making the final decision. Particular\ncare is taken to design a proper strategy to train the SVMs the 1.5C classifier\nrelies on. This is a crucial task, due to the difficulty of training the two 1C\nclassifiers at the front end of the system. We assessed the performance of the\nproposed solution with regard to three manipulation detection tasks, namely\nimage resizing, contrast enhancement and median filtering. As a result, the\nsecurity improvement allowed by the 1.5C architecture with respect to a\nconventional 2C solution is confirmed, with a performance loss in the absence\nof attacks that remains at a negligible level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 11:41:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2019 13:37:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 14:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

In this\npaper, we obtain improved bounds in many of these situations, showing that the\nMetropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) is faster than the best bounds\nfor its competitor algorithms when the target distribution satisfies weak\nthird- and fourth- order regularity properties associated with the input data.\nIn many settings, our regularity conditions are weaker than the usual Euclidean\noperator norm regularity properties, allowing us to show faster bounds for a\nmuch larger class of distributions than would be possible with the usual\nEuclidean operator norm approach, including in statistics and machine learning\napplications where the data satisfy a certain incoherence condition. In\nparticular, we show that using our regularity conditions one can obtain faster\nbounds for applications which include sampling problems in Bayesian logistic\nregression with weakly convex priors, and the nonconvex optimization problem of\nlearning linear classifiers with zero-one loss functions.\n  Our main technical contribution in this paper is our analysis of the\nMetropolis acceptance probability of MALA in terms of its \"energy-conservation\nerror,\" and our bound for this error in terms of third- and fourth- order\nregularity conditions.

While the vast majority\nof these domains are legitimate, adversaries also register new hostnames to\ncarry out nefarious purposes, such as scams, phishing, or other types of\nattacks. In this paper, we present insights on the global utilization of DNS\nthrough a measurement study examining exclusively newly observed hostnames via\npassive DNS data analysis. We analyzed more than two billion such hostnames\ncollected over a period of two months. Surprisingly, we find that only three\nsecond-level domains are responsible for more than half of all newly observed\nhostnames every day. More specifically, we found that Google's Accelerated\nMobile Pages (AMP) project, the music streaming service Spotify, and a DNS\ntunnel provider generate the majority of new domains on the Internet. DNS\ntunneling is a covert channel technique to transfer arbitrary information over\nDNS via DNS queries and answers. This technique is often (ab)used by attackers\nto transfer data in a stealthy way, bypassing traditional network security\nsystems. We find that potential DNS tunnels cause a significant fraction of the\nglobal DNS requests for new hostnames: our analysis reveals that nearly all\nresource record type NULL requests and more than a third of all TXT requests\ncan be attributed to DNS tunnels.\n  Motivated by these empirical measurement results, we propose and implement a\nmethod to identify DNS tunnels via a step-wise filtering approach that relies\non general characteristics of such tunnels (e.g., number of subdomains or\nresource record type). Using our approach on empirical data, we successfully\nidentified 273 suspicious domains related to DNS tunnels, including two known\nAPT campaigns (Wekby and APT32).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 12:07:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-25"}

Analysing error growth\nrates along a very long model trajectory, we show that blockings are associated\nwith conditions of anomalously high instability of the atmosphere.\nAdditionally, the lifetime of a blocking is positively correlated with the\nintensity of such an anomaly, against intuition. In the case of Atlantic\nblockings, predictability is especially reduced at the onset and decay of the\nblocking, while a relative increase of predictability is found in the mature\nphase, while the opposite holds for Pacific blockings, for which predictability\nis lowest in the mature phase. We associate blockings to a specific class of\nunstable periodic orbits (UPOs), natural modes of variability that cover the\nattractor of the system. The UPOs differ substantially in terms of instability,\nwhich explains the diversity of the atmosphere in terms predictability. The\nUPOs associated to blockings are indeed anomalously unstable, which leads to\nthem being rarely visited. The onset of a blocking takes place when the\ntrajectory of the system hops into the neighbourhood of one of these special\nUPOs. The decay takes place when the trajectory hops back to the neighbourhood\nof usual, less unstable UPOs associated with zonal flow. This justifies the\nclassical Markov chains-based analysis of transitions between weather regimes.\nThe existence of UPOs differing in the dimensionality of their unstable\nmanifold indicates a very strong violation of hyperbolicity in the model, which\nleads to a lack of structural stability.

In the earliest (`heroic') one, simulations\nwere expensive and could at most be considered as substitutes for experiments.\nLater, as computers grew faster and some meaningful simulations could be\nperformed overnight, it became practical to use them as (`routine') as tools to\nprovide answers to specific theoretical questions. More recently, some\nturbulence simulations have become trivial, able to run in minutes, and it is\npossible to think of computers as `Monte Carlo' theory machines, which can be\nused to systematically pose a wide range of `random' theoretical questions,\nonly to later evaluate which of them are interesting or useful. Although\napparently wasteful, it is argued that this procedure has the advantage of\nbeing reasonably independence of received wisdom, and thus more able than human\nresearchers to scape established paradigms. The rate of growth of computer\npower ensures that the interval between consecutive stages is about fifteen\nyears. Rather than offering conclusions, the purpose of the paper is to\nstimulate discussion on whether machine- and human-generated theories can be\nconsidered comparable concepts, and on how the challenges and opportunities\ncreated by our new computer `colleagues' can be made to fit into the\ntraditional research process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 12:44:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-12"}

However, when the dimension $p$ is large relative to\nsample size $n$ and where either or both of means and covariances/graphical\nmodels may differ between the latent groups, mixture models face statistical\nand computational difficulties and currently available methods cannot\nrealistically go beyond $p \\! \\sim \\! 10^4$ or so. We propose an approach\ncalled Model-based Clustering via Adaptive Projections (MCAP). Instead of\nestimating mixtures in the original space, we work with a low-dimensional\nrepresentation obtained by linear projection. The projection dimension itself\nplays an important role and governs a type of bias-variance tradeoff with\nrespect to recovery of the relevant signals. MCAP sets the projection dimension\nautomatically in a data-adaptive manner, using a proxy for the assignment risk.\nCombining a full covariance formulation with the adaptive projection allows\ndetection of both mean and covariance signals in very high dimensional\nproblems. We show real-data examples in which covariance signals are reliably\ndetected in problems with $p \\! \\sim \\! 10^4$ or more, and simulations going up\nto $p = 10^6$. In some examples, MCAP performs well even when the mean signal\nis entirely removed, leaving differential covariance structure in the\nhigh-dimensional space as the only signal. Across a number of regimes, MCAP\nperforms as well or better than a range of existing methods, including a\nrecently-proposed $\\ell_1$-penalized approach; and performance remains broadly\nstable with increasing dimension.

The results are presented in terms of accuracy and convergence\nrates, using different approximations and refinement setups, namely Gaussian\nand monomial based approximations, and a comparison of execution time for each\nblock of the solution procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 13:28:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-25"}

In this work, we continue the development of the MPS approach to\nstudy ultrafast electron dynamics in quantum chemical systems.

We use advanced LIGO data from its first and\nsecond observing runs spanning 2015-2017, which provides the\nhighest-sensitivity gravitational-wave data so far obtained. In this search we\ntarget emission from both the $l = m = 2$ mass quadrupole mode, with a\nfrequency at twice that of the pulsar's rotation, and from the $l = 2$, $m = 1$\nmode, with a frequency at the pulsar rotation frequency. The search finds no\nevidence for gravitational-wave emission from any pulsar at either frequency.\nFor the $l = m = 2$ mode search, we provide updated upper limits on the\ngravitational-wave amplitude, mass quadrupole moment, and fiducial ellipticity\nfor 167 pulsars, and the first such limits for a further 55. For 20 young\npulsars these results give limits that are below those inferred from the\npulsars' spin-down. For the Crab and Vela pulsars our results constrain\ngravitational-wave emission to account for less than 0.017% and 0.18% of the\nspin-down luminosity, respectively. For the recycled millisecond pulsar\nJ0711-6830 our limits are only a factor of 1.3 above the spin-down limit,\nassuming the canonical value of $10^{38}$ kg m$^2$ for the star's moment of\ninertia, and imply a gravitational-wave-derived upper limit on the star's\nellipticity of $1.2\\!\\times\\!10^{-8}$. We also place new limits on the emission\namplitude at the rotation frequency of the pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 14:23:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 10:09:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 18:34:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 21:36:39 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 11:57:47 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 16:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

This leads to various\ninstabilities, bearing the name of double-diffusive convection. We investigate\nrotating double-diffusive convection (RDDC) in fluid spheres. We use the\nBoussinesq approximation with homogeneous internal thermal and compositional\nsource terms. We focus on the finger regime, in which the thermal gradient is\nstabilising whereas the compositional one is destabilising. First, we perform a\nglobal linear stability analysis in spheres. The critical Rayleigh numbers\ndrastically drop for stably stratified fluids, yielding large-scale convective\nmotions where local analyses predict stability. We evidence the inviscid nature\nof this large-scale double-diffusive instability, enabling the determination of\nthe marginal stability curve at realistic planetary regimes. In particular, we\nshow that in stably stratified spheres, the Rayleigh numbers $Ra$ at the onset\nevolve like $Ra \\sim Ek^{-1}$, where $Ek$ is the Ekman number. This differs\nfrom rotating convection in unstably stratified spheres, for which $Ra \\sim\nEk^{-4/3}$. The domain of existence of inviscid convection thus increases as\n$Ek^{-1/3}$. Second, we perform nonlinear simulations. We find a transition\nbetween two regimes of RDDC, controlled by the strength of the stratification.\nFurthermore, far from the RDDC onset, we find a dominating equatorially\nanti-symmetric, large-scale zonal flow slightly above the associated linear\nonset. Unexpectedly, a purely linear mechanism can explain this phenomenon,\neven far from the instability onset, yielding a symmetry breaking of the\nnonlinear flow at saturation. For even stronger stable stratification, the flow\nbecomes mainly equatorially-symmetric and intense zonal jets develop. Finally,\nwe apply our results to the early Earth core. Double diffusion can reduce the\ncritical Rayleigh number by four decades for realistic core conditions. We\nsuggest that the early Earth core was prone to turbulent RDDC, with large-scale\nzonal flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 15:09:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 13:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

The Zwicky Transient Facility is one example of such a\nsurvey. In addition, it has a dedicated very-low resolution spectrograph, the\nSEDMachine, operating on the Palomar 60-inch telescope. This spectrograph's\nprimary aim is object classification. In practice most, if not all, transients\nof interest brighter than ~19 mag are typed. This corresponds to approximately\n10 to 15 targets a night. In this paper, we present a fully automated pipeline\nfor the SEDMachine. This pipeline has been designed to be fast, robust, stable\nand extremely flexible. pysedm enables the fully automated spectral extraction\nof a targeted point source object in less than 5 minutes after the end of the\nexposure. The spectral color calibration is accurate at the few percent level.\nIn the 19 weeks since pysedm entered production in early August of 2018, we\nhave classified, among other objects, about 400 Type Ia supernovae and 140 Type\nII supernovae.

With this perspective in mind, pysedm has been\ndesigned to easily be adaptable to any IFU-like spectrograph (see\nhttps://github.com/MickaelRigault/pysedm).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 15:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

This could have significant consequences for\nusing particle stabilisation in industrial applications where increased\nstability is generally desirable. It is therefore important to characterise the\nbehaviour and stability of these composites under the influence of freeze-thaw\ncycles. Water-in-oil Pickering emulsions stabilised by poly(methyl\nmethacrylate) particles were subjected to freeze-thaw cycles of the continuous\nphase under two different conditions - uniform and non-uniform freezing.\nConfocal microscopy was used to study the emulsion behaviour and structure\nduring these processes. The effect of droplet size and cooling rate on\nuniformly frozen emulsions was also considered. The final structure of the\nemulsion after a single freeze-thaw cycle is strongly dependent on the freezing\nmethod. Uniformly frozen emulsions show crumpled droplet structures, while\nnon-uniformly frozen emulsions have a non-uniform structure containing\nfoam-like regions not observed in uniform freezing. Droplet size has little\neffect on the final structure of uniformly frozen emulsions, which we attribute\nto the Laplace pressure in the droplets being orders of magnitude smaller than\nthe pressure exerted on the droplets by the growing oil crystals. Cooling rate\nalso has little effect as droplets become surrounded and trapped by oil\ncrystals rapidly after samples reach the oil freezing temperature, irrespective\nof the speed at which they reached that temperature. When compared to\nsurfactant-stabilised emulsions undergoing the same process, we find emulsion\nstructure is recoverable in the surfactant case, whereas particle-stabilised\nemulsions are irreversibly altered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 15:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-25"}

Our work demonstrates both the\napplication of similarity comparison networks to animal re-identification, as\nwell as the capabilities of deep convolutional neural networks to generalize\nacross domains. Few studies have considered animal re-identification methods\nacross species. Here, we compare two similarity comparison methodologies:\nSiamese and Triplet-Loss, based on the AlexNet, VGG-19, DenseNet201,\nMobileNetV2, and InceptionV3 architectures considering mean average precision\n(mAP)@1 and mAP@5.

We demonstrate that\nTriplet Loss outperformed its Siamese counterpart for all species. Without any\nspecies-specific modifications, our results demonstrate that similarity\ncomparison networks can reach a performance level beyond that of humans for the\ntask of animal re-identification. The ability for researchers to re-identify an\nanimal individual upon re-encounter is fundamental for addressing a broad range\nof questions in the study of population dynamics and community/behavioural\necology.

First, to make the hidden states\nmore distinguishable, we regularize the similarity between consecutive hidden\nstates based on the corresponding target tokens. Second, to force the hidden\nstates to contain all the information in the source sentence, we leverage the\ndual nature of translation tasks (e.g., English to German and German to\nEnglish) and minimize a backward reconstruction error to ensure that the hidden\nstates of the NAT decoder are able to recover the source side sentence.\nExtensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets show that both\nregularization strategies are effective and can alleviate the issues of\nrepeated translations and incomplete translations in NAT models. The accuracy\nof NAT models is therefore improved significantly over the state-of-the-art NAT\nmodels with even better efficiency for inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 02:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-28"}

The model predicts a cyclic\nexpansion/contraction evolution of the Universe within a limited range of scale\nfactors. The maximum scale factor is controlled by the overcritical density of\nthe Universe, the minimum scale factor depends on global stellar and dust\nmasses in the Universe. During contraction due to gravitational forces, the\nextragalactic background light (EBL) and intergalactic opacity increase with\ntime because of a smaller proper volume of the Universe. The radiation pressure\nproduced by absorption of the EBL by dust steeply rises and counterbalances the\ngravitational forces. The maximum redshift, at which the radiation pressure is\ncapable to stop the contraction and start a new expansion, is between 15 and\n45. The model avoids the Big Bang and concepts of the non-baryonic dark matter\nand dark energy. The model successfully explains the existence of very old\nmature galaxies at high redshifts and observed dimming of the luminosity of SNe\nIa with redshift. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is interpreted as\nthermal radiation of intergalactic dust and its temperature is predicted with\naccuracy higher than 2%. The CMB temperature anisotropies are caused by the EBL\nfluctuations related to large-scale structures in the Universe. A strong\ndecline of the luminosity density at z > 4 is explained by high opacity of the\nUniverse rather than by its darkness due to a missing stellar mass at high\nredshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 14:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-28"}

In the\nliterature, many libraries of elementary approximate circuits have already been\nproposed to simplify the design process of approximate accelerators. Because\nthese libraries contain from tens to thousands of approximate implementations\nfor a single arithmetic operation it is intractable to find an optimal\ncombination of approximate circuits in the library even for an application\nconsisting of a few operations. An open problem is \"how to effectively combine\ncircuits from these libraries to construct complex approximate accelerators\".\nThis paper proposes a novel methodology for searching, selecting and combining\nthe most suitable approximate circuits from a set of available libraries to\ngenerate an approximate accelerator for a given application. To enable fast\ndesign space generation and exploration, the methodology utilizes machine\nlearning techniques to create computational models estimating the overall\nquality of processing and hardware cost without performing full synthesis at\nthe accelerator level. Using the methodology, we construct hundreds of\napproximate accelerators (for a Sobel edge detector) showing different but\nrelevant tradeoffs between the quality of processing and hardware cost and\nidentify a corresponding Pareto-frontier. Furthermore, when searching for\napproximate implementations of a generic Gaussian filter consisting of 17\narithmetic operations, the proposed approach allows us to identify\napproximately $10^3$ highly important implementations from $10^{23}$ possible\nsolutions in a few hours, while the exhaustive search would take four months on\na high-end processor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 08:35:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 09:11:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-13"}
