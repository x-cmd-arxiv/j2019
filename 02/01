Standard approaches like\nmomentum or ADAM only consider a single direction, and do not try to model\ndistance from extremum - neglecting valuable information from calculated\nsequence of gradients, often stagnating in some suboptimal plateau. Second\norder methods could exploit these missed opportunities, however, beside\nsuffering from very large cost and numerical instabilities, many of them\nattract to suboptimal points like saddles due to negligence of signs of\ncurvatures (as eigenvalues of Hessian).\n  Saddle-free Newton method is a rare example of addressing this issue -\nchanges saddle attraction into repulsion, and was shown to provide essential\nimprovement for final value this way. However, it neglects noise while\nmodelling second order behavior, focuses on Krylov subspace for numerical\nreasons, and requires costly eigendecomposion.\n  Maintaining SFN advantages, there are proposed inexpensive ways for\nexploiting these opportunities. Second order behavior is linear dependence of\nfirst derivative - we can optimally estimate it from sequence of noisy\ngradients with least square linear regression, in online setting here: with\nweakening weights of old gradients.

A recent approach proposed to\naddress this problem directly tackles these considerations, but has a\nsignificant limitation: it assumes that the decision maker has accurate\nknowledge of the joint maliciousness probability of the nodes on the network.\nThis is clearly not the case in practice, where such a distribution is at best\nan estimate from limited evidence.

We first classify higher-order Dirac models according to the\ntime-reversal, particle-hole, and chiral symmetries, and determine the\neven-oddness of the order of band crossing in each symmetry class. The\neven-oddness further constrains the rotational symmetry $m$ permitted in a\nsymmetry class.

The former relies on machine learning and cannot work well due\nto the severe imbalance between non-vulnerable and vulnerable code or lack of\nfeatures to characterize vulnerabilities. The latter needs the prior knowledge\nof known vulnerabilities and can only identify similar but not new types of\nvulnerabilities.\n  In this paper, we propose and implement a generic, lightweight and extensible\nframework, LEOPARD, to identify potentially vulnerable functions through\nprogram metrics. LEOPARD requires no prior knowledge about known\nvulnerabilities. It has two steps by combining two sets of systematically\nderived metrics. First, it uses complexity metrics to group the functions in a\ntarget application into a set of bins. Then, it uses vulnerability metrics to\nrank the functions in each bin and identifies the top ones as potentially\nvulnerable. Our experimental results on 11 real-world projects have\ndemonstrated that, LEOPARD can cover 74.0% of vulnerable functions by\nidentifying 20% of functions as vulnerable and outperform machine\nlearning-based and static analysis-based techniques. We further propose three\napplications of LEOPARD for manual code review and fuzzing, through which we\ndiscovered 22 new bugs in real applications like PHP, radare2 and FFmpeg, and\neight of them are new vulnerabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 17:09:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Jan 2020 11:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

One approach to construct the MGP and account for non-trivial\ncommonalities amongst outputs employs a convolution process (CP). The CP is\nbased on the idea of sharing latent functions across several convolutions.\nDespite the elegance of the CP construction, it provides new challenges that\nneed yet to be tackled. First, even with a moderate number of outputs, model\nbuilding is extremely prohibitive due to the huge increase in computational\ndemands and number of parameters to be estimated. Second, the negative transfer\nof knowledge may occur when some outputs do not share commonalities. In this\npaper we address these issues. We propose a regularized pairwise modeling\napproach for the MGP established using CP. The key feature of our approach is\nto distribute the estimation of the full multivariate model into a group of\nbivariate GPs which are individually built. Interestingly pairwise modeling\nturns out to possess unique characteristics, which allows us to tackle the\nchallenge of negative transfer through penalizing the latent function that\nfacilitates information sharing in each bivariate model. Predictions are then\nmade through combining predictions from the bivariate models within a Bayesian\nframework.

To achieve this level of security, the FAPI\nemploys a range of mechanisms that have been developed to harden OAuth 2.0.\n  In this paper, we perform a rigorous, systematic formal analysis of the\nsecurity of the FAPI, based on the Web Infrastructure Model (WIM) proposed by\nFett, Kuesters, and Schmitz. To this end, we first develop a precise model of\nthe FAPI in the WIM, including different profiles and combinations of security\nfeatures. We then use our model of the FAPI to precisely define central\nsecurity properties. In an attempt to prove these properties, we uncover partly\nsevere attacks, breaking authentication, authorization, and session integrity\nproperties. We develop mitigations against these attacks and finally are able\nto formally prove the security of a fixed version of the FAPI.\n  This analysis is an important contribution to the development of the FAPI\nsince it helps to define exact security properties and attacker models, and to\navoid severe security risks.\n  Of independent interest, we also uncover weaknesses in the aforementioned\nsecurity mechanisms for hardening OAuth 2.0.

First, we examine\nvalve anatomy and present the results of original dissections. These display\nthe gross anatomy and information on fiber structure of the mitral valve. Next,\nwe build a model valve following a design-based methodology, meaning that we\nderive the model geometry and the forces that are needed to support a given\nload, and construct the model accordingly. We incorporate information from the\ndissections to specify the fiber topology of this model. We assume the valve\nachieves mechanical equilibrium while supporting a static pressure load. The\nsolution to the resulting differential equations determines the pressurized\nconfiguration of the valve model. To complete the model we then specify a\nconstitutive law based on a stress-strain relation consistent with experimental\ndata that achieves the necessary forces computed in previous steps. Finally,\nusing the immersed boundary method, we simulate the model valve in fluid in a\ncomputer test chamber. The model opens easily and closes without leak when\ndriven by physiological pressures over multiple beats. Further, its closure is\nrobust to driving pressures that lack atrial systole or are much lower or\nhigher than normal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 18:40:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 20:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-19"}

This is referred to as the thermal eccentricity\ndistribution, and has been widely used for initial conditions in theoretical\ninvestigations of binary stars. However, observations suggest that the\neccentricity distributions of most observed binaries, and particularly those\nwith masses < 5 Msun, are flatter than thermal and follow more closely to a\nuniform distribution. Nonetheless, it is often argued that dynamical\ninteractions in a star cluster would quickly thermalize the binaries, which\ncould justify imposing a thermal eccentricity distribution at birth for all\nbinaries. In this paper we investigate the validity of this assumption. We\ndevelop our own rapid semi-analytic model for binary evolution in star\nclusters, and also compare with detailed N-body and Monte Carlo star cluster\nmodels. We show that, for nearly all binaries, dynamical encounters fail to\nconvert an initially uniform eccentricity distribution to thermal within a star\ncluster's lifetime. Thus, if a thermal eccentricity distribution is observed,\nit is likely imprinted upon formation rather than through subsequent long-term\ndynamical processing. Theoretical investigations that initialize all binaries\nwith a thermal distribution will make incorrect predictions for the evolution\nof the binary population. Such models may overpredict the merger rate for\nbinaries with modest orbital separations by a factor of about two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

Two specific ways this challenge exhibits itself is\nthrough keyword mapping and join path inference. Keyword mapping is the task of\nmapping individual keywords in the original NLQ to database elements (such as\nrelations, attributes or values). It is challenging due to the ambiguity in\nmapping the user's mental model and diction to the schema definition and\ncontents of the underlying database. Join path inference is the process of\nselecting the relations and join conditions in the FROM clause of the final SQL\nquery, and is difficult because NLIDB users lack the knowledge of the database\nschema or SQL and therefore cannot explicitly specify the intermediate tables\nand joins needed to construct a final SQL query. In this paper, we propose\nleveraging information from the SQL query log of a database to enhance the\nperformance of existing NLIDBs with respect to these challenges. We present a\nsystem Templar that can be used to augment existing NLIDBs. Our extensive\nexperimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, leading\nup to 138% improvement in top-1 accuracy in existing NLIDBs by leveraging SQL\nquery log information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 19:00:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

As a consequence, besides the existence of classical\neffects due to the interaction between particle and boundary, there will be a\nquantum contribution to the motion of the particle whose magnitude depends on\nhow fast the transition between the different vacuum states occurs.

Dispersions of the\nparticle velocity in both, zero and finite temperature regimes are examined.\nMore than just generalizing previous results for specific configurations, new\neffects are unveiled.

The use of a controllable switching enable us to\nconclude that thermal effects can be as important as or even stronger than\nvacuum effects arbitrarily near the wall. Additionally, the residual effect\npredicted to occur in the late time regime was here shown to be linked to the\nduration of the transition.

Here, we introduce a\ncoarse-grained continuum model, based on local-slender body theory, for elastic\nfibers immersed in a viscous Newtonian fluid. It takes the form of an\nanisotropic Brinkman equation whose skeletal drag is coupled to elastic forces.\nThis model has two significant benefits: (1) the density effects of the fibers\nin a suspension become analytically manifest, and (2) it allows for the rapid\nsimulation of dense suspensions of fibers in regimes inaccessible to standard\nmethods. As a first validation, without fitting parameters, we achieve very\nreasonable agreement with 3D Immersed Boundary simulations of a bed of anchored\nfibers bent by a shear flow. Secondly, we characterize the effect of density on\nthe relaxation time of fiber beds under oscillatory shear, and find close\nagreement to results from full numerical simulations. We then study buckling\ninstabilities in beds of fibers, using our model both numerically and\nanalytically to understand the role of fiber density and the structure of\nbuckling transitions. We next apply our model to study the flow-induced bending\nof inclined fibers in a channel, as has been recently studied as a flow\nrectifier, examining the nature of the internal flows within the bed, and the\nemergence of inhomogeneous permeability.

The well known and widely celebrated\ntotal variation regularization, which is the L1 norm of derivatives, turns out\nto be unsuitable for this problem; it is unable to handle both noise and\nunder-sampling together. This issue is linked with the notion of phase\ntransition phenomenon observed in compressive sensing research, which is\nessentially the break-down of total variation methods, when sampling density\ngets lower than certain threshold. The severity of this breakdown is determined\nby the so-called mutual incoherence between the derivative operators and\nmeasurement operator. In our problem, the mutual incoherence is low, and hence\nthe total variation regularization gives serious artifacts in the presence of\nnoise even when the sampling density is not very low. There has been very few\nattempts in developing regularization methods that perform better than total\nvariation regularization for this problem. We develop a multi-resolution based\nregularization method that is adaptive to image structure. In our approach, the\ndesired reconstruction is formulated as a series of coarse-to-fine\nmulti-resolution reconstructions; for reconstruction at each level, the\nregularization is constructed to be adaptive to the image structure, where the\ninformation for adaption is obtained from the reconstruction obtained at\ncoarser resolution level. This adaptation is achieved by using maximum entropy\nprinciple, where the required adaptive regularization is determined as the\nmaximizer of entropy subject to the information extracted from the coarse\nreconstruction as constraints. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\nregularization method over existing ones using several reconstruction examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 20:36:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 10:38:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Feb 2019 04:15:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 17 Feb 2019 12:51:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Cluster\nidentification and photometry in this subsample are similar to that of the\nentire LEGUS sample, but special methods were developed to provide robust\ncatalogs with accurate fluxes due to low cluster statistics. The colors and\nages are largely consistent for two widely used aperture corrections, but a\nsignificant fraction of the clusters are more compact than the average training\ncluster. However, the ensemble luminosity, mass, and age distributions are\nconsistent suggesting that the systematics between the two methods are less\nthan the random errors. When compared with the clusters from previous dwarf\ngalaxy samples, we find that the LEGUS catalogs are more complete and provide\nmore accurate total fluxes. Combining all clusters into a composite dwarf\ngalaxy, we find that the luminosity and mass functions can be described by a\npower law with the canonical index of $-2$ independent of age and global SFR\nbinning. The age distribution declines as a power law, with an index of\n$\\approx-0.80\\pm0.15$, independent of cluster mass and global SFR binning. This\ndecline of clusters is dominated by cluster disruption since the combined star\nformation histories and integrated-light SFRs are both approximately constant\nover the last few hundred Myr.

They share characteristics of both brown\ndwarfs and transiting exoplanets, therefore, are critical for connecting\natmospheric characterizations for these objects. Rotational phase mapping is a\npowerful technique to constrain the condensate cloud properties in ultra-cool\natmospheres. Applying this technique to directly-imaged planetary-mass\ncompanions will be extremely valuable for constraining cloud models in low mass\nand surface gravity atmospheres and for determining the rotation rate and\nangular momentum of substellar companions.

Pairs of\nfeature vectors are trained to be similar or different, depending on whether\nthe corresponding pixels belong to same or different ground truth segments. To\nsegment a new image, the feature vectors are computed and clustered. Both\nempirically and theoretically, it is unclear whether or when deep metric\nlearning is superior to the more conventional approach of directly predicting\nan affinity graph with a convolutional net. We compare the two approaches using\nbrain images from serial section electron microscopy images, which constitute\nan especially challenging example of instance segmentation. We first show that\nseed-based postprocessing of the feature vectors, as originally proposed,\nproduces inferior accuracy because it is difficult for the convolutional net to\npredict feature vectors that remain uniform across large objects. Then we\nconsider postprocessing by thresholding a nearest neighbor graph followed by\nconnected components.

As a result, miners are heavily\nincentivized to design and utilize Application Specific Integrated Circuits\n(ASICs) that can compute hashes far more efficiently than existing general\npurpose hardware. Currently, it is difficult for most users to purchase and\noperate ASICs due to pricing and availability constraints, resulting in a\nrelatively small number of miners with respect to total user base for most\npopular cryptocurrencies. In this work, we aim to invert the problem of ASIC\ndevelopment by constructing a Proof-of-Work function for which an existing\ngeneral purpose processor (GPP, such as an x86 IC) is already an optimized\nASIC. In doing so, we will ensure that any would-be miner either already owns\nan ASIC for the Proof-of-Work system they wish to participate in or can attain\none at a competitive price with relative ease.

In this paper, we build on this strong baseline by designing\nan episodic training procedure that trains a single deep network in a way that\nexposes it to the domain shift that characterises a novel domain at runtime.\nSpecifically, we decompose a deep network into feature extractor and classifier\ncomponents, and then train each component by simulating it interacting with a\npartner who is badly tuned for the current domain. This makes both components\nmore robust, ultimately leading to our networks producing state-of-the-art\nperformance on three DG benchmarks.

Here, we study how analogical reasoning\ncan be induced in neural networks that learn to perceive and reason about raw\nvisual data. We find that the critical factor for inducing such a capacity is\nnot an elaborate architecture, but rather, careful attention to the choice of\ndata and the manner in which it is presented to the model. The most robust\ncapacity for analogical reasoning is induced when networks learn analogies by\ncontrasting abstract relational structures in their input domains, a training\nmethod that uses only the input data to force models to learn about important\nabstract features. Using this technique we demonstrate capacities for complex,\nvisual and symbolic analogy making and generalisation in even the simplest\nneural network architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 23:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-04"}

Six years\nafter the discovery, with a conspicuously larger dataset collected during LHC\nRun 2 at a 13 TeV centre-of-mass energy, the theory and experimental particle\nphysics communities have started a meticulous exploration of the potential for\nprecision measurements of its properties.

Each receiver requests an\narbitrary file from the library. The objective is to design a cache placement\nwithout knowing the receivers' requests and a communication scheme such that\nthe sum Degrees of Freedom (sum-DoF) of the delivery is maximized.

One of biggest limitations of this\nscheme is the requirement of high subpacketization level. This paper is the\nfirst attempt in the literature (according to our knowledge) to reduce the file\nsubpacketization in such a network. In particular, we propose a new approach\nfor both prefetching and linear delivery schemes based on a combinatorial\ndesign called {\\em hypercube}.

Surprisingly, the identical\nand near optimal sum-DoF performance can be achieved using the hypercube\napproach with a much less file subpacketization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 23:51:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 06:14:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 07:34:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

Approximate message passing (AMP) is a class of\nlow-complexity algorithms for efficiently solving such high-dimensional\nregression tasks. Often, it is the case that side information (SI) is available\nduring reconstruction. For this reason a novel algorithmic framework that\nincorporates SI into AMP, referred to as approximate message passing with side\ninformation (AMP-SI), has been recently introduced. An attractive feature of\nAMP is that when the elements of the signal are exchangeable, the entries of\nthe measurement matrix are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)\nGaussian, and the denoiser applies the same non-linearity at each entry, the\nperformance of AMP can be predicted accurately by a scalar iteration referred\nto as state evolution (SE). However, the AMP-SI framework uses different\nentry-wise scalar denoisers, based on the entry-wise level of the SI, and\ntherefore is not supported by the standard AMP theory. In this work, we provide\nrigorous performance guarantees for AMP-SI when the input signal and SI are\ndrawn i.i.d. according to some joint distribution subject to finite moment\nconstraints. Moreover, we provide numerical examples to support the theory\nwhich demonstrate empirically that the SE can predict the AMP-SI mean square\nerror accurately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 02:10:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 00:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

There has been no work found to reduce the number of parameters\nused in GANs. Therefore, we propose a method to compress GANs using knowledge\ndistillation techniques, in which a smaller \"student\" GAN learns to mimic a\nlarger \"teacher\" GAN. We show that the distillation methods used on MNIST,\nCIFAR-10, and Celeb-A datasets can compress teacher GANs at ratios of 1669:1,\n58:1, and 87:1, respectively, while retaining the quality of the generated\nimage.

Group-based intervention programs offer a promising means of preventing\nand reducing substance abuse. While effective, unfortunately, inappropriate\nintervention groups can result in an increase in deviant behaviors among\nparticipants, a process known as deviancy training. This paper investigates the\nproblem of optimizing the social influence related to the deviant behavior via\ncareful construction of the intervention groups. We propose a Mixed Integer\nOptimization formulation that decides on the intervention groups, captures the\nimpact of the groups on the structure of the social network, and models the\nimpact of these changes on behavior propagation. In addition, we propose a\nscalable hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm that combines Mixed Integer\nProgramming and Large Neighborhood Search to find near-optimal network\npartitions. Our algorithm is packaged in the form of GUIDE, an AI-based\ndecision aid that recommends intervention groups. Being the first quantitative\ndecision aid of this kind, GUIDE is able to assist practitioners, in particular\nsocial workers, in three key areas: (a) GUIDE proposes near-optimal solutions\nthat are shown, via extensive simulations, to significantly improve over the\ntraditional qualitative practices for forming intervention groups; (b) GUIDE is\nable to identify circumstances when an intervention will lead to deviancy\ntraining, thus saving time, money, and effort; (c) GUIDE can evaluate current\nstrategies of group formation and discard strategies that will lead to deviancy\ntraining.

Current discrete methods are either slow or require heavy parallel\ncomputing. The objective of this paper is to present a novel fast and robust\nmethod of solving the image gradient or Laplacian with minimal error, which can\nbe used for gradient domain editing.

Previous\nstudies investigated the wake form dependance on $KC=U_0T/D$, where $KC$ is the\nKeulegan-Carpenter number, $D$ is the island diameter, $U_0$ the tidal velocity\namplitude and $T$ the tidal period, and the stability parameter $S=c_fD/h$\nwhere $h$ is the water depth and $c_f$ is the bottom boundary friction\ncoefficient. In this study we demonstrate that when the influence of bottom\nfriction is confined to a Stokes boundary layer the parameter $S=\\delta^+/KC$\nwhere $\\delta^+=\\delta/h$ and $\\delta=2\\pi\\sqrt{2\\nu/\\omega}$ is the wavelength\nof the Stokes bottom boundary layer.

The gravitational-wave (GW)\nstandard sirens, produced by the coalescence of double neutron stars and black\nhole--neutron star binaries, provide an independent way to measure the\ndistances of GW sources, which are not affected by cosmic opacity. In this\npaper, we first propose that combining the GW observations of third-generation\nGW detectors with SN Ia data in similar redshift ranges offers a novel and\nmodel-independent method to constrain cosmic opacity. Through Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we find that one can constrain the cosmic opacity parameter\n$\\kappa$ with an accuracy of $\\sigma_{\\kappa}\\sim0.046$ by comparing the\ndistances from 100 simulated GW events and 1048 current Pantheon SNe Ia.

These capabilities are being exploited by mobile apps developers to\nproduce apps that offer more functionalities and optimized performance. To\nensure acceptable quality and to meet their specifications (e.g., design),\nmobile apps need to be tested thoroughly. As the testing process is often\ntedious, test automation can be the key to alleviating such laborious\nactivities. In the context of the Android-based mobile apps, researchers and\npractitioners have proposed many approaches to automate the testing process\nmainly on the creation of the test suite.

In the\nsmall-angle (\"pencil beam\") approximation, this diffusion further occurs over a\nsmall solid angle in wavevector space. The second regime corresponds to a much\nlater time, by which scattering has rendered the photon distribution\nnear-isotropic resulting in a spatial diffusion of the radiation. The third\nregime involves time-dependent fluctuations and, therefore, Fermi acceleration\nof photons. Combined, these results provide a comprehensive theoretical\nframework within which to understand several important features of propagation\nof radio burst waves in the solar corona: emitted photons are accelerated in a\nrelatively small inner region and then diffuse outwards to larger distances. En\nroute, angular diffusion results both in source sizes which are substantially\nlarger than the intrinsic source, and in observed intensity-versus-time\nprofiles that are asymmetric, with a sharp rise and an exponential decay. Both\nof these features are consistent with observations of solar radio bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 09:15:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 22:35:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

And we compare the algorithm\nwith the traditional brute force method, then conclude that our algorithm has\nlower time complexity and can solve the problems of maximum-weight matching\nmore effectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 10:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-04"}

They can lock these planets into an asynchronous rotation state of\nequilibrium. We aim at characterizing the dependence of the tidal torque\nresulting from the semidiurnal thermal tide on the tidal frequency, the planet\norbital radius, and the atmospheric surface pressure. The tidal torque is\ncomputed from full 3D simulations of the atmospheric climate and mean flows\nusing a generic version of the LMDZ general circulation model (GCM) in the case\nof a nitrogen-dominated atmosphere. Numerical results are discussed with the\nhelp of an updated linear analytical framework. Power scaling laws governing\nthe evolution of the torque with the planet orbital radius and surface pressure\nare derived. The tidal torque exhibits i) a thermal peak in the vicinity of\nsynchronization, ii) a resonant peak associated with the excitation of the Lamb\nmode in the high frequency range, and iii) well defined frequency slopes\noutside these resonances. These features are well explained by our linear\ntheory. Whatever the star-planet distance and surface pressure, the torque\nfrequency spectrum -- when rescaled with the relevant power laws -- always\npresents the same behaviour. This allows us to provide a single and easily\nusable empirical formula describing the atmospheric tidal torque over the whole\nparameter space. With such a formula, the effect of the atmospheric tidal\ntorque can be implemented in evolutionary models of the rotational dynamics of\na planet in a computationally efficient, and yet relatively accurate way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 11:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

The short-term reliability evaluation of power systems, which is\nessential for power system operators in decision making to secure the system\nreal time balancing, calls for the accurate modelling of operating reserve\nprovided by TCLs. However, the particular characteristics of TCLs make their\ndynamic response different from the traditional generating units, resulting in\ndifficulties to accurately represent the reliability of operating reserve\nprovided by TCLs with conventional reliability model. This paper proposes a\nnovel multi-state reliability model of operating reserve provided by TCLs\nconsidering their dynamic response during the reserve deployment process. An\nanalytical model for characterizing dynamics of operating reserve provided by\nTCLs is firstly developed based on the migration of TCLs' room temperature\nwithin the temperature hysteresis band. Then, considering the stochastic\nconsumers' behaviour and ambient temperature, the probability distribution\nfunctions of reserve capacity provided by TCLs are obtained by cumulants. On\nthis basis, the states of reserve capacity and the corresponding probabilities\nat each time instant are obtained for representing the reliability of operating\nreserve provided by TCLs in the LZ-transform approach. Case studies are\nconducted to validate the proposed technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 12:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-04"}

A\ncomparison of the performance of the designed sensing matrix and the sensing\nmatrices constructed using other existing methods is also presented. The\nsimulation results on the recovery of synthetic, speech, and image signals,\ncompressively sensed using the sensing matrix identified, shows an improvement\nin the accuracy of recovery.

In this thesis, we develop an\napproach to the study of such theories purely in terms of the behaviour of\ntheir processes, as described mathematically through the language of category\ntheory. This extends a framework for quantum processes known as categorical\nquantum mechanics (CQM) due to Abramsky and Coecke.\n  We first consider categorical frameworks for operational theories. We\nintroduce a notion of such theory, based on those of Chiribella, D'Ariano and\nPerinotti (CDP), but more general than the probabilistic ones typically\nconsidered. We establish a correspondence between these and what we call\n\"operational categories\", using features introduced by Jacobs et al. in\neffectus theory, an area of categorical logic to which we provide an\noperational interpretation. We then see how to pass to a broader category of\n\"super-causal\" processes, allowing for the powerful diagrammatic features of\nCQM.\n  Next we study operational theories themselves. We survey numerous principles\nthat a theory may satisfy, treating them in a basic diagrammatic setting, and\nrelating notions from probabilistic theories, CQM and effectus theory. We\nprovide a new description of superpositions in the category of pure quantum\nprocesses, using this to give an abstract construction of the category of\nHilbert spaces and linear maps.\n  Finally, we reconstruct finite-dimensional quantum theory itself. More\nbroadly, we give a recipe for recovering a class of generalised quantum\ntheories, before instantiating it with operational principles inspired by an\nearlier reconstruction due to CDP. This reconstruction is fully categorical,\nnot requiring the usual technical assumptions of probabilistic theories.\nSpecialising to such theories recovers both standard quantum theory and that\nover real Hilbert spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 14:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-04"}

However, their\nnet effect on energy and environmental outcomes is unclear. Higher fuel economy\nreduces the energy required per mile of travel, but it also reduces the fuel\ncost of travel, incentivizing more travel and causing an energy \"rebound\neffect.\" Moreover, CAVs are predicted to vastly reduce the time cost of travel,\ninducing further increases in travel and energy use. In this paper, we forecast\nthe induced travel and rebound from CAVs using data on existing travel\nbehavior. We develop a microeconomic model of vehicle miles traveled (VMT)\nchoice under income and time constraints; then we use it to estimate\nelasticities of VMT demand with respect to fuel and time costs, with fuel cost\ndata from the 2017 United States National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) and\nwage-derived predictions of travel time cost. Our central estimate of the\ncombined price elasticity of VMT demand is -0.4, which differs substantially\nfrom previous estimates. We also find evidence that wealthier households have\nmore elastic demand, and that households at all income levels are more\nsensitive to time costs than to fuel costs. We use our estimated elasticities\nto simulate VMT and energy use impacts of full, private CAV adoption under a\nrange of possible changes to the fuel and time costs of travel. We forecast a\n2-47% increase in travel demand for an average household. Our results indicate\nthat backfire - i.e., a net rise in energy use - is a possibility, especially\nin higher income groups. This presents a stiff challenge to policy goals for\nreductions in not only energy use but also traffic congestion and local and\nglobal air pollution, as CAV use increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 17:19:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 23:55:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 18:47:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 20:16:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-13"}

This crucial aspect will ultimately enable the dynamic\ndeployment of heterogeneous services by different network operators over the\nsame physical infrastructure. RAN slicing is a form of 5G virtualization that\nallows network infrastructure owners to dynamically \"slice\" and \"serve\" their\nnetwork resources (i.e., spectrum, power, antennas, among others) to different\nmobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), according to their current needs.\nOnce the slicing policy (i.e., the percentage of resources assigned to each\nMVNO) has been computed, a major challenge is how to allocate spectrum\nresources to MVNOs in such a way that (i) the slicing policy defined by the\nnetwork owner is enforced; and (ii) the interference among different MVNOs is\nminimized. In this article, we mathematically formalize the RAN slicing\nenforcement problem (RSEP) and demonstrate its NP-hardness. For this reason, we\ndesign three approximation algorithms that render the solution scalable as the\nRSEP increases in size. We extensively evaluate their performance through\nsimulations and experiments on a testbed made up of 8 software-defined radio\nperipherals.

Converting this\nosmotic energy through reverse-electrodialysis relies on ion-selective\nmembranes. A novel generation of these membranes is based on atomically thin\nMoS$_2$ membranes to decrease the resistance to current flow to increase power\noutput. By modulating the surface charge by light we are able to raise the ion\nselectivity of the membrane by a factor of 5 while staying at a neutral pH.\nFurthermore, we find that the behavior of small nanopores is dominated by\nsurface conductance. We introduce a formalism based on the Dukhin number to\nquantify these effects in the case of a concentration gradient system. As a\nconsequence, the charges created by light illumination provoke two important\nchanges. Increased surface charge at the pore rim enhances the ion selectivity\nand therefore larger osmotic voltage (dominating in small pores), while the\nincreased surface charge of the overall membrane enhances the surface\nconductance and therefore the osmotic current (dominating in larger pores). The\ncombination of these effects might be able to efficiently boost the energy\ngeneration with arrays of nanopores with varying pore sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 15:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-04"}

This method\naims at building up a statistically-equivalent surrogate for the PPF solutions\nthrough a small number of power flow evaluations. By exploiting the retained\ntensor-product form of the univariate polynomial basis, a sequential\ncorrection-updating scheme is applied, making the total number of unknowns to\nbe linear rather than exponential to the number of random inputs.

We show that simple interval techniques for propagating perturbation\neffects through the network enables the efficient computation of robustness\n(i.e., accuracy guarantees) for MWD networks under any perturbations, including\nadversarial attacks.\n  MWD networks are significantly more robust to input perturbations than ReLU\nnetworks. On permutation invariant MNIST, when test examples can be perturbed\nby 20% of the input range, MWD networks provably retain accuracy above 83%,\nwhile the accuracy of ReLU networks drops below 5%. The provable accuracy of\nMWD networks is superior even to the observed accuracy of ReLU networks trained\nwith the help of adversarial examples. In the absence of adversarial attacks,\nMWD networks match the performance of sigmoid networks, and have accuracy only\nslightly below that of ReLU networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 00:56:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

The reversible case was addressed by Hsu et al. [2019], who left the\ngeneral case as an open problem. In the reversible case, the analysis is\ngreatly facilitated by the fact that the Markov operator is self-adjoint, and\nWeyl's inequality allows for a dimension-free perturbation analysis of the\nempirical eigenvalues. As Hsu et al. point out, in the absence of reversibility\n(which induces asymmetric pair probabilities matrices), the existing\nperturbation analysis has a worst-case exponential dependence on the number of\nstates $d$. Furthermore, even if an eigenvalue perturbation analysis with\nbetter dependence on $d$ were available, in the non-reversible case the\nconnection between the spectral gap and the mixing time is not nearly as\nstraightforward as in the reversible case. Our key insight is to estimate the\npseudo-spectral gap $\\gamma_{\\mathsf{ps}}$ instead, which allows us to overcome\nthe loss of symmetry and to achieve a polynomial dependence on the minimal\nstationary probability $\\pi_\\star$ and $\\gamma_{\\mathsf{ps}}$. Additionally, in\nthe reversible case, we obtain simultaneous nearly (up to logarithmic factors)\nminimax rates in $t_{\\mathsf{mix}}$ and precision $\\varepsilon$, closing a gap\nin Hsu et al., who treated $\\varepsilon$ as constant in the lower bounds.\nFinally, we construct fully empirical confidence intervals for\n$\\gamma_{\\mathsf{ps}}$, which shrink to zero at a rate of roughly $1/\\sqrt{m}$,\nand improve the state of the art in even the reversible case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 08:13:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 09:07:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 13:43:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2022 09:18:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-17"}

The study concludes by\nnoting that with the methods used, RZT can distinguish between the speech\nrhythms of well-defined sub-genres of native speaker reading vs. non-native\nlearner reading, but needs further refinement in order to be applied to the\nparadoxically more complex speech of low-performing language learners, whose\nspeech rhythms are co-determined by non-fluency and disfluency factors in\naddition to well-known linguistic factors of grammar, vocabulary and discourse\nconstraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 20:49:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 19:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-14"}

Knowledge of the equilibrium\npoints is important for our life, since all complex structures, such as any\nhighly developed living organism, our society and also multi-competitive\norganizations in economics, biology and game theory strive for them. To reduce\na more complicated case with nonsmooth functions describing the state of each\nelement of the system as damage, loss, or profit, to a case with smooth\nfunctions the Steklov average integrals are used that turn nonsmooth functions\ninto smooth ones, for which previously developed numerical methods can be used\nfor finding equilibrium points.

The gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) satellite mission\nprovided a valuable independent data source for tracking TWS at regional and\ncontinental scales. Strong interests exist in fusing GRACE data into global\nhydrological models to improve their predictive performance. Here we develop\nand apply deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models to learn the\nspatiotemporal patterns of mismatch between TWS anomalies (TWSA) derived from\nGRACE and those simulated by NOAH, a widely used land surface model. Once\ntrained, our CNN models can be used to correct the NOAH simulated TWSA without\nrequiring GRACE data, potentially filling the data gap between GRACE and its\nfollow-on mission, GRACE-FO. Our methodology is demonstrated over India, which\nhas experienced significant groundwater depletion in recent decades that is\nnevertheless not being captured by the NOAH model. Results show that the CNN\nmodels significantly improve the match with GRACE TWSA, achieving a\ncountry-average correlation coefficient of 0.94 and Nash-Sutcliff efficient of\n0.87, or 14\\% and 52\\% improvement respectively over the original NOAH TWSA. At\nthe local scale, the learned mismatch pattern correlates well with the observed\nin situ groundwater storage anomaly data for most parts of India, suggesting\nthat deep learning models effectively compensate for the missing groundwater\ncomponent in NOAH for this study region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 16:28:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-07"}

Instead of sending pickers to the inventory area to\nsearch for and pick the ordered items, robots carry shelves (called \"pods\")\nincluding ordered items from the inventory area to picking stations. In the\npicking stations, human pickers put ordered items into totes; then these items\nare transported by a conveyor to the packing stations. This type of warehousing\nsystem relieves the human pickers and improves the picking process. In this\npaper, we concentrate on decisions about the assignment of pods to stations and\norders to stations to fulfill picking for each incoming customer's order. In\nprevious research for an RMFS with multiple picking stations, these decisions\nare made sequentially. Instead, we present a new integrated model.

By applying the B\\'ezier extraction, the\noriginal Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) control meshes can be\ntransformed into the B\\'ezier elements which allow us to inherit the standard\nnumerical procedure like the finite element method (FEM).

The FG plate contains the internal pores and GPLs\ndispersed in the metal matrix either uniformly or non-uniformly according to\nvarious different patterns along the thickness of plate. In addition, to\ncontrol dynamic responses, two piezoelectric layers are perfectly bonded on the\ntop and bottom surfaces of the FG plate.
