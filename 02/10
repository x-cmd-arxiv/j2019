One way to alleviate this is through network policy enforcement.\nUnfortunately, WiFi lacks protocol support for configuring policies for its\nusage, and since network-wide coordination cannot generally be ensured,\nenforcing policy is challenging. However, as we have shown in previous work, an\naccess point can influence the behaviour of connected devices by changing its\nscheduling of transmission opportunities, which can be used to achieve airtime\nfairness.

In the thermodynamic mean-field limit, an infinite number of\nneurons interact via vanishingly small interactions, thereby erasing the finite\nsize of interactions. To better capture the finite-size effects of\ninteractions, we propose to analyze the activity of neural networks in the\nreplica-mean-field limit.

In\ncontrast, the SAS-CFF model demonstrates that environmental stochasticity can\npromote genetic diversity. Extending the SAS-CFF to account for demography, I\nexamine the simultaneous effects of environmental stochasticity on genetic\ndiversity and population persistence. Consistent with Gillespie's analysis, if\nthe log-fitness function is concave and allelic responses to the environment\nare not perfectly correlated, then per-capita growth rates of rare alleles are\npositive and genetic diversity is maintained in the sense of stochastic\npersistence i.e. allelic frequencies tend to stay away from zero almost-surely\nand in probability. Alternatively, if the log-fitness function is convex, then\nper-capita growth rates of rare alleles are negative and an allele\nasymptotically fixates with probability one. If the population's low-density,\nper-capita growth rate is positive, then the population persists in the sense\nof stochastic persistence, else it goes asymptotically extinct with probability\none. In contrast to per-capita growth rates of rare alleles, the population's\nper-capita growth rate is a decreasing function of the concavity of the\nlog-fitness function. Moreover, when the log-fitness function is concave,\nallelic diversity increases the population's per-capita growth rate while\ndecreasing the per-capita growth rate of rare alleles, and environmental\nstochasticity increases the per-capita growth rate of rare alleles but\ndecreases the population's per-capita growth rate.

The performance of SSI and BOLT-SSI are evaluated by\ncomprehensive simulation and real case studies. Numerical results demonstrate\nthat SSI and BOLT-SSI can often outperform their competitors in terms of\ncomputational efficiency and statistical accuracy. The proposed method can be\napplied for fully detecting interactions with more than 300,000 predictors.\nBased on this study, we believe that there is a great need to rethink the\nrelationship between statistical accuracy and computational efficiency. We have\nshown that the computational performance of a statistical method can often be\ngreatly improved by exploring the advantages of computational architecture with\na tolerable loss of statistical accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2019 01:32:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 08:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

The\ncontributions of global shape and local interactions usually mix together and\nare difficult to tease part. In this work, we use symmetry to elucidate the\ndistinct roles of global shape and local interactions in protein dynamics.\nSymmetric complexes provide an ideal platform for this task since in them the\neffects of local interactions and global shape are separable, allowing their\ndistinct roles to be identified. Our key findings based on symmetric assemblies\nare: (i) the motion patterns of each subunit are determined primarily by\nintra-subunit interactions (IRSi), and secondarily by inter-subunit\ninteractions (IESi); (ii) the motion patterns of the whole assembly are fully\ndictated by the global symmetry/shape and have nothing to do with local iESi or\nIRSi.

A large volume of data\nsteadily come out of a large number of sensors in the monitoring system. Thus,\nwe need to consider how to store and manage these data. Existing time series\ndatabases (TSDBs) can be used for monitoring data storage, but they do not have\ngood models for describing the data streams stored in the database. In this\npaper, we develop a semantic model for the specification of the monitoring data\nstreams (time series data) in terms of which sensor generated the data stream,\nwhich metric of which entity the sensor is monitoring, what is the relation of\nthe entity to other entities in the system, which measurement unit is used for\nthe data stream, etc. We have also developed a tool suite, SE-TSDB, that can\nrun on top of existing TSDBs to help establish semantic specifications for data\nstreams and enable semantic-based data retrievals. With our semantic model for\nmonitoring data and our SE-TSDB tool suite, users can retrieve non-existing\ndata streams that can be automatically derived from the semantics. Users can\nalso retrieve data streams without knowing where they are. Semantic based\nretrieval is especially important in a large-scale integrated IoT-Edge-Cloud\nsystem, because of its sheer quantity of data, its huge number of computing and\nIoT devices that may store the data, and the dynamics in data migration and\nevolution. With better data semantics, data streams can be more effectively\ntracked and flexibly retrieved to help with timely data analysis and control\ndecision making anywhere and anytime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2019 04:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

A further reduction to the nuclear\nscale is needed to produce an effective interaction for soft Hilbert spaces,\nsuch as those employed in the shell model. Here we describe an alternative\nconstruction of this effective interaction, from QCD directly to the nuclear\nscale, that is direct and precise. This eliminates the need for constructing\nand renormalizing the high-momentum NN potential. Instead, continuum phase\nshifts and mixing angles are used directly at the nuclear scale. The method\nexploits the analytic continuity in energy of HOBET (Harmonic-Oscillator-Based\nEffective Theory) to connect bound states to continuum solutions at specific\nenergies. The procedure is systematic, cutoff independent, and convergent,\nyielding keV accuracy at NNLO or N$^3$LO, depending on the channel.

In this paper, we extend a previous study\nby investigating a problem of sampling a stationary Gauss-Markov process,\nnamely the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. The optimal sampling problem is\nformulated as a constrained continuous-time Markov decision process (MDP) with\nan uncountable state space.

Further, if the sampler has no knowledge of the OU\nprocess, the optimal sampling problem reduces to an MDP for minimizing a\nnonlinear age of information metric. The age-optimal sampling policy is a\nthreshold policy on expected estimation error and the threshold is found.

The relaxation is\ncharacterized by multiply time scales, and in the long-time limit it is\ndetermined by the single particle relaxation process in a typical time scale\n$T^*$. For the bulk bands, we find $T^* \\propto N^3/\\gamma n^2 $ in the weak\ndissipation limit; and $T^* \\propto \\gamma N^3/ n^2$ in the strong dissipation\nlimit, where $N$ is the chain length, $\\gamma$ is the dissipation rate and $n$\nis the band index.

Current heterogeneous methods try\nto extend VIS face recognition methods to the NIR spectrum by synthesizing VIS\nimages from NIR images. However, due to self-occlusion and sensing gap, NIR\nface images lose some visible lighting contents so that they are always\nincomplete compared to VIS face images. This paper models high resolution\nheterogeneous face synthesis as a complementary combination of two components,\na texture inpainting component and pose correction component. The inpainting\ncomponent synthesizes and inpaints VIS image textures from NIR image textures.\nThe correction component maps any pose in NIR images to a frontal pose in VIS\nimages, resulting in paired NIR and VIS textures. A warping procedure is\ndeveloped to integrate the two components into an end-to-end deep network. A\nfine-grained discriminator and a wavelet-based discriminator are designed to\nsupervise intra-class variance and visual quality respectively. One UV loss,\ntwo adversarial losses and one pixel loss are imposed to ensure synthesis\nresults. We demonstrate that by attaching the correction component, we can\nsimplify heterogeneous face synthesis from one-to-many unpaired image\ntranslation to one-to-one paired image translation, and minimize spectral and\npose discrepancy during heterogeneous recognition. Extensive experimental\nresults show that our network not only generates high-resolution VIS face\nimages and but also facilitates the accuracy improvement of heterogeneous face\nrecognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2019 10:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

In this work, we explore a new\ndirection with Generative Adversarial Networks and show that they contribute to\nbetter face modeling performances, especially in decoupling natural factors,\nwhile also achieving more diverse samples. To train the model we introduce a\nnovel architecture that combines a 3D generator with a 2D discriminator that\nleverages conventional CNNs, where the two components are bridged by a geometry\nmapping layer. We further present a training scheme, based on auxiliary\nclassifiers, to explicitly disentangle identity and expression attributes.\nThrough quantitative and qualitative results on standard face datasets, we\nillustrate the benefits of our model and demonstrate that it outperforms\ncompeting state of the art methods in terms of decoupling and diversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2019 15:15:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 14:02:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 7 Sep 2019 17:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

However, as new vulnerabilities are discovered, requirements\nevolve aimed at ensuring resiliency. There is currently a shortage of an\ninexpensive, automated mechanism that can effectively repair the initial\ndesign, and a model-based system developer regularly needs to redesign and\nreimplement the system from scratch. In this paper, we propose a new\nmethodology along with a Matlab toolkit called REAFFIRM to facilitate the\nmodel-based repair for improving the resiliency of CPSs. REAFFIRM takes the\ninputs including 1) an original hybrid system modeled as a Simulink/Stateflow\ndiagram, 2) a given resiliency pattern specified as a model transformation\nscript, and 3) a safety requirement expressed as a Signal Temporal Logic\nformula, and then outputs a repaired model which satisfies the requirement. The\noverall structure of REAFFIRM contains two main modules, a model\ntransformation, and a model synthesizer built on top of the falsification tool\nBreach. We introduce a new model transformation language for hybrid systems,\nwhich we call HATL to allow a designer to specify resiliency patterns. To\nevaluate the proposed approach, we use REAFFIRM to automatically synthesize\nrepaired models for an adaptive cruise control (ACC) system under a GPS sensor\nspoofing attack, for a single-machine infinite-bus (SMIB) system under a\nsliding-mode switching attack, and for a missile guidance system under\ngyroscopes sensor attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Feb 2019 20:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

One of the main reasons is that often the\ninterpretation of the news requires the knowledge of political or social\ncontext or 'common sense', which current NLP algorithms are still missing.\nRecent studies have shown that fake and real news spread differently on social\nmedia, forming propagation patterns that could be harnessed for the automatic\nfake news detection.

This paper examines the performance of different\nreputation algorithms when applied to a large and statistically significant\nportion of the news that are spread via Twitter. Our main result is that simple\ncrowdsourcing-based algorithms are able to identify a large portion of fake or\nmisleading news, while incurring only very low false positive rates for\nmainstream websites. We believe that these algorithms can be used as the basis\nof practical, large-scale systems for indicating to consumers which news sites\ndeserve careful scrutiny and skepticism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2019 07:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

This linguistic differences and diversity,\nthough may be seen as a beautiful feature, have contributed to the difficulty\nin the promotion of educational and cultural development of different domains\nin the country. An effective machine translation system solely dedicated to\ncater Philippine languages will surely help bridge this gap. In this research\nwork, a never before applied approach for language translation to a Philippine\nlanguage was used for a Cebuano to Tagalog translator. A Recurrent Neural\nNetwork was used to implement the translator using OpenNMT sequence modeling\ntool in TensorFlow. The performance of the translation was evaluated using the\nBLEU Score metric. For the Cebuano to Tagalog translation, BLEU produced a\nscore of 20.01. A subword unit translation for verbs and copyable approach was\nperformed where commonly seen mistranslated words from the source to the target\nwere corrected. The BLEU score increased to 22.87. Though slightly higher, this\nscore still indicates that the translation is somehow understandable but is not\nyet considered as a good translation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2019 13:28:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-21"}

This extra flavor\nmay change the observable, $|m_{\\beta\\beta}|$ of currently data taking and\nnext-generation $(\\beta\\beta)_{0\\nu}$-decay experiments aim to probe and\npossibly look the Inverted Ordering region($|m_{\\beta\\beta}| \\simeq 10^{-2}$eV)\nof parameter space. This observation would allow establishing physics beyond\nthe standard model and phenomena like lepton number violation and Majorana\nnature of neutrino. The range of this observable ($|m_{\\beta\\beta}|$) is not\nvery well defined for both the ordering of mass spectrum(Normal Ordering and\nInverted Ordering). Several attempts have been made for defining exactly the\nrange for three active neutrino states. For contrasting this range, I have\nworked with an extra mass states, $\\nu_{4}$ and its effect on the observable\nwith various combination of CP violation Majorana phases by taking into account\nthe updated data on the neutrino oscillation parameters for IO case. Based on\nthe Monte Carlo technique, a parameter region is obtained using the fourth\nMajorana-Dirac phase of sterile parameters that lead to an effective mass below\n0.01 eV or .05 eV for inverted mass ordering case which is planned to be\nobserved in the near future experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2019 13:12:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-09"}

Redundancy is eliminated by\ndimensionality reduction, but contemporary digital processing techniques face\nharsh fundamental tradeoffs when implementing this class of functions. These\ntradeoffs can be broken in the analog domain, in which the performance of\noptical technologies greatly exceeds that of electronic counterparts. Here, we\npresent concepts, methods, and a first demonstration of multivariate photonics:\na combination of integrated photonic hardware, analog dimensionality reduction,\nand blind algorithmic techniques. We experimentally demonstrate 2-channel, 1.0\nGHz principal component analysis in a photonic weight bank using recently\nproposed algorithms for synthesizing the multivariate properties of signals to\nwhich the receiver is blind. Novel methods are introduced for controlling\nblindness conditions in a laboratory context.
