These protocols are often claimed to guarantee privacy\nbecause of the uncertainty they introduce on the node that started the\ndissemination. But is that claim really true? Can the source of a gossip safely\nhide in the crowd? This paper examines, for the first time, gossip protocols\nthrough a rigorous mathematical framework based on differential privacy to\ndetermine the extent to which the source of a gossip can be traceable.\nConsidering the case of a complete graph in which a subset of the nodes are\ncurious, we study a family of gossip protocols parameterized by a ``muting''\nparameter $s$: nodes stop emitting after each communication with a fixed\nprobability $1-s$. We first prove that the standard push protocol,\ncorresponding to the case $s=1$, does not satisfy differential privacy for\nlarge graphs. In contrast, the protocol with $s=0$ achieves optimal privacy\nguarantees but at the cost of a drastic increase in the spreading time compared\nto standard push, revealing an interesting tension between privacy and\nspreading time. Yet, surprisingly, we show that some choices of the muting\nparameter $s$ lead to protocols that achieve an optimal order of magnitude in\nboth privacy and speed. We also confirm empirically that, with appropriate\nchoices of $s$, we indeed obtain protocols that are very robust against\nconcrete source location attacks while spreading the information almost as fast\nas the standard (and non-private) push protocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 16:52:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 12:49:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 09:01:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 13:59:51 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 15:01:20 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 13:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

Recent experimental and theoretical studies on the\nsteady flow in shallow deformable microchannels have shown that the flow rate\nis a nonlinear function of the pressure drop due to the deformation of the\nupper soft wall. Here, we extend the steady theory of Christov et al. (2018) by\nconsidering the start-up flow from rest, both in pressure-controlled and in\nflow-rate-controlled configurations. The characteristic scales and relevant\nparameters governing the transient flow are first identified, followed by the\ndevelopment of an unsteady lubrication theory assuming that the inertia of the\nfluid is negligible, and that the upper wall can be modeled as an elastic plate\nunder pure bending satisfying the Kirchhoff-Love equation. The model is\ngoverned by two non-geometrical dimensionless numbers: a compliance parameter\n$\\beta$, which compares the characteristic displacement of the upper wall with\nthe undeformed channel height, and a parameter $\\gamma$ that compares the\ninertia of the solid with its flexural rigidity. In the limit of negligible\nsolid inertia, $\\gamma \\to 0$, a quasi-steady model is developed, whereby the\nfluid pressure satisfies a nonlinear diffusion equation, with $\\beta$ as the\nonly parameter, which admits a self-similar solution under pressure-controlled\nconditions. This simplified lubrication description is validated with coupled\nthree-dimensional numerical simulations of the Navier equations for the elastic\nsolid and the Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid. The agreement is very good\nwhen the hypotheses behind the model are satisfied. Unexpectedly, we find fair\nagreement even in cases where the solid and liquid inertia cannot be neglected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 17:52:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 14:58:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 08:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-14"}

The\nevaporation behaviour is modulated by an increase in the field strength and\nfrequency. The classical diffusion driven evaporation model is found\ninsufficient in predicting the improved evaporation rates. The change in\nsurface tension due to field constraint is insufficient for explaining the\nobserved physics. Consequently, the internal hydrodynamics of the droplet is\nprobed employing particle image velocimetry. It is revealed that the electric\nfield induces enhanced internal advection, which improves the evaporation\nrates. A scaled analytical model is proposed to understand the role of internal\nelectrohydrodynamics, electrothermal and the electrosolutal effects. Stability\nmaps reveal that the advection is caused nearly equally by the electrosolutal\nand electrothermal effects within the droplet. The model is able to illustrate\nthe influence played by the governing thermal and solutal Marangoni number, the\nelectro Prandtl and electro Schmidt number, and the associated\nElectrohydrodynamic number.

In a single step of the dynamics, an\nindividual chosen at random copies the state of a random neighbor in the\npopulation. In this basic formulation it is assumed that the copying is\nperfect, and thus an exact copy of an individual is generated at each time\nstep. Here we introduce and study a variant of the multi-state voter model in\nmean-field that incorporates a degree of imperfection or error in the copying\nprocess, which leaves the states of the two interacting individuals similar but\nnot exactly equal. This dynamics can also be interpreted as a perfect copying\nwith the addition of noise; a minimalistic model for flocking. We found that\nthe ordering properties of this multi-state noisy voter model, measured by a\nparameter $\\psi$ in [0, 1], depend on the amplitude $\\eta$ of the copying error\nor noise and the population size N. In the case of perfect copying $\\eta=0$ the\nsystem reaches an absorbing configuration with complete order ($\\psi=1$) for\nall values of N. However, for any degree of imperfection $\\eta>0$, we show that\nthe average value of $\\psi$ at the stationary state decreases with N as\n$\\langle \\psi \\rangle \\simeq 6/(\\pi^2 \\eta^2 N)$ for $\\eta \\ll 1$ and $\\eta^2 N\n\\gtrsim 1$, and thus the system becomes totally disordered in the thermodynamic\nlimit $N \\to \\infty$.

In any\nnumerical implementation of the FPF algorithm, the main challenge is to\nnumerically approximate the so-called gain function. A numerical algorithm for\ngain function approximation is the subject of this paper. The exact gain\nfunction is the solution of a Poisson equation involving a probability-weighted\nLaplacian $\\Delta_\\rho$. The numerical problem is to approximate this solution\nusing {\\em only} finitely many particles sampled from the probability\ndistribution $\\rho$. A diffusion map-based algorithm was proposed by the\nauthors in a prior work to solve this problem. The algorithm is named as such\nbecause it involves, as an intermediate step, a diffusion map approximation of\nthe exact semigroup $e^{\\Delta_\\rho}$. The original contribution of this paper\nis to carry out a rigorous error analysis of the diffusion map-based algorithm.\nThe error is shown to include two components: bias and variance. The bias\nresults from the diffusion map approximation of the exact semigroup. The\nvariance arises because of finite sample size. Scalings and upper bounds are\nderived for bias and variance. These bounds are then illustrated with numerical\nexperiments that serve to emphasize the effects of problem dimension and sample\nsize.

Several concepts of fairness are investigated and special\nattention is paid to a solution concept named nucleolus, which aims to minimize\nthe maximum dissatisfaction in the system.

Turbulence in galaxy\nclusters is then characterized by multiple injection scales, with the small\nscale driving source acting in addition to the large scale injection\nmechanisms. Cooling runs of relaxed clusters exhibit enstrophy profiles with a\npower-law behavior over more than two decades in radius, and a\nturbulent-to-thermal energy ratio ~1 %.

However,\npersonalization of the synergy setting is necessary for the effective operation\nof the prosthetic device. Two major challenges hinder the personalization of\nsynergies in human-prosthesis interfaces. The first is related to the process\nof human motor adaptation and the second to the variation in motor learning\ndynamics of individuals. In this paper, a systematic personalization of\nkinematic synergies for human-prosthesis interfaces using on-line measurements\nfrom each individual is proposed. The task of reaching using the upper-limb is\ndescribed by an objective function and the interface is parameterized by a\nkinematic synergy. Consequently, personalizing the interface for a given\nindividual can be formulated as finding an optimal personalized parameter. A\nstructure to model the observed motor behavior that allows for the personalized\ntraits of motor preference and motor learning is proposed, and subsequently\nused in an on-line optimization scheme to identify the synergies for an\nindividual. The knowledge of the common features contained in the model enables\non-line adaptation of the human-prosthesis interface to happen concurrently to\nhuman motor adaptation without the need to re-tune the personalization\nalgorithm for each individual.

There has been extensive interest in\nrigid matrices as Valiant showed in his MFCS'77 paper that rigidity can be used\nto prove arithmetic circuit lower bounds.\n  In a surprising result, Alman and Williams (FOCS'19) showed that the (real\nvalued) Hadamard matrix, which was conjectured to be rigid, is actually not\nvery rigid. This line of work was extended by Dvir and Edelman (\\emph{Theory of\nComputing}, 2019) to a family of matrices related to the Hadamard matrix, but\nover finite fields. In our work, we take another step in this direction and\nshow that for any abelian group $G$ and function $f:G \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$,\nthe matrix given by $M_{xy} = f(x - y)$ for $x,y \\in G$ is not rigid. In\nparticular, we get that complex valued Fourier matrices, circulant matrices,\nand Toeplitz matrices are all not rigid and cannot be used to carry out\nValiant's approach to proving circuit lower bounds. Our results also hold when\nwe consider matrices over a fixed finite field instead of the complex numbers.\nThis complements a recent result of Goldreich and Tal (\\emph{Comp.

To this aim, we\ndownloaded 15 years (2003-2017) of cloud coverage data from the AQUA satellite,\nin a matrix that includes also Armazones, the site of the European Extremely\nLarge Telescope. By applying the Fast Fourier Transform to these data we\ndetected a periodicity peak of about 14 days. We studied the tide cycle at\nChanaral De Las Animas, on the ocean coast, for the year 2017, and we\ncorrelated it with the atmospheric perturbations at Paranal and the lunar\nphases. We found a significant correlation (96%) between the phenomena of short\nduration and intensity (1-3 days) and the tidal cycle at Chanaral. We then show\nthat an atmospheric perturbation occurs at Paranal in concomitance with the low\ntide, which anticipates the full (or the new) moon by 3-4 days. This result\nallows to improve current weather forecasting models for astronomical\nobservatories by introducing a lunar variable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 23:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

For practical applications, large-scale\nroom-temperature solid-state platforms are required. Color centers in layered\nhexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have recently been found to be ultra-bright and\nstable SPEs at room temperature. Yet, to scale up solid-state quantum\ninformation processing, large tuning range of single photon energy is demanded\nfor wavelength division multiplexing quantum key distribution, where\nindistinguishability is not required, and for indistinguishable single-photon\nproduction from multi-emitters. Stark effect can tune the single photon energy\nby an electric field, which however, has been achieved only at cryogenic\ntemperature so far. Here we report the first room-temperature Stark effect of\nSPEs by exploiting hBN color centers. Surprisingly, we observe a giant Stark\nshift of single photon more than 30 meV, about one order of magnitude greater\nthan previously reported in color center emitters. Moreover, for the first\ntime, the orientation of the electric permanent dipole moment in the\nsolid-state SPE is determined via angle-resolved Stark effect, revealing the\nintrinsic broken symmetries at such a color center.

In this scenario, clients send their raw\ndata to the server to run the deep learning model and send back the results.\nOne standing challenge in this setting is to ensure the privacy of the clients'\nsensitive data. Oblivious inference is the task of running the neural network\non the client's input without disclosing the input or the result to the server.\nThis paper introduces XONN, a novel end-to-end framework based on Yao's Garbled\nCircuits (GC) protocol, that provides a paradigm shift in the conceptual and\npractical realization of oblivious inference. In XONN, the costly\nmatrix-multiplication operations of the deep learning model are replaced with\nXNOR operations that are essentially free in GC. We further provide a novel\nalgorithm that customizes the neural network such that the runtime of the GC\nprotocol is minimized without sacrificing the inference accuracy.\n  We design a user-friendly high-level API for XONN, allowing expression of the\ndeep learning model architecture in an unprecedented level of abstraction.\nExtensive proof-of-concept evaluation on various neural network architectures\ndemonstrates that XONN outperforms prior art such as Gazelle (USENIX\nSecurity'18) by up to 7x, MiniONN (ACM CCS'17) by 93x, and SecureML (IEEE\nS&P'17) by 37x.

DRAM chips do not carry out any computation or other important\nfunctions, such as security. Processors implement most of the existing security\nmechanisms that protect the system against security threats, because 1)\nexecuting security mechanisms usually require non-trivial computational\ncapabilities (e.g., encryption), and 2) commodity DRAM chips are not designed\nto perform computations or tasks other than data storage. In this work, we\nadvocate for DRAM as a key component for providing security mechanisms to the\nsystem. To this end, we propose Dataplant, a new class of low-cost,\nhigh-performance, and reliable security primitives that can be integrated in\ncommodity DRAM chips with minimal changes. The main idea of Dataplant is to\nslightly modify the internal DRAM timing signals to expose the inherent process\nvariation found in all DRAM chips for generating unpredictable but reproducible\nvalues (e.g., keys) within DRAM. We use Dataplant to build two new security\nmechanisms. First, a new Dataplant-based physical unclonable function (PUF)\nwith non-destructive read-out, low evaluation latency, robust responses,\nresiliency to temperature changes, and data-independent responses. Second, a\nnew cold boot attack prevention mechanism that automatically destroys all data\nwithin DRAM on every power cycle with zero run-time energy and latency\noverheads. Using a combination of detailed simulations and experiments with 136\nreal commodity DRAM chips, we show that our Dataplant-based PUF has 1.8x higher\nthroughput than the best state-of-the-art DRAM PUFs.

In DSMS, there\nare $k$ identical mobile servers residing at the processors of a network. At\narbitrary points of time, any subset of processors can invoke one or more\nrequests. To serve a request, one of the servers must move to the processor\nthat invoked the request. Resource allocation is performed in a distributed\nmanner since only the processor that invoked the request initially knows about\nit. All processors cooperate by passing messages to achieve correct resource\nallocation. They do this with the goal to minimize the communication cost.\n  Routing servers in large-scale distributed systems requires a scalable\nlocation service. We introduce the distributed protocol GNN that solves the\nDSMS problem on overlay trees.

In the refugee matching context, this score\ncorresponds to the predicted probability of employment, while in the student\nassignment context it corresponds to standardized test scores. The mechanism is\na priority mechanism that considers both outcomes and preferences by assigning\nagents (refugee families, students) based on their preferences, but subject to\nmeeting the planner's specified threshold. The mechanism is both strategy-proof\nand constrained efficient in that it always generates a matching that is not\nPareto dominated by any other matching that respects the planner's threshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 00:17:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 01:41:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 17:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-13"}

We conducted experiments on NIST LRE07\nclosed-set task, and the results reveal that the proposed attention-based\nCNN-BLSTM model achieves comparable error reduction with other state-of-the-art\nutterance-level neural network approaches for all 3 seconds, 10 seconds, 30\nseconds duration tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 02:14:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-21"}

Sample re-weighting strategy is\ncommonly used to alleviate this issue by designing a weighting function mapping\nfrom training loss to sample weight, and then iterating between weight\nrecalculating and classifier updating. Current approaches, however, need\nmanually pre-specify the weighting function as well as its additional\nhyper-parameters.

This\ntrend has largely been driven by a line of research aiming to characterize the\naverage-case complexity of sparse PCA through reductions from the planted\nclique (PC) conjecture - which conjectures that there is no polynomial-time\nalgorithm to detect a planted clique of size $K = o(N^{1/2})$ in\n$\\mathcal{G}(N, \\frac{1}{2})$. All previous reductions to sparse PCA either\nfail to show tight computational lower bounds matching existing algorithms or\nshow lower bounds for formulations of sparse PCA other than its canonical\ngenerative model, the spiked covariance model. Also, these lower bounds all\nquickly degrade with the exponent in the PC conjecture. Specifically, when only\ngiven the PC conjecture up to $K = o(N^\\alpha)$ where $\\alpha < 1/2$, there is\nno sparsity level $k$ at which these lower bounds remain tight. If $\\alpha \\le\n1/3$ these reductions fail to even show the existence of a\nstatistical-computational tradeoff at any sparsity $k$. We give a reduction\nfrom PC that yields the first full characterization of the computational\nbarrier in the spiked covariance model, providing tight lower bounds at all\nsparsities $k$. We also show the surprising result that weaker forms of the PC\nconjecture up to clique size $K = o(N^\\alpha)$ for any given $\\alpha \\in (0,\n1/2]$ imply tight computational lower bounds for sparse PCA at sparsities $k =\no(n^{\\alpha/3})$. This shows that even a mild improvement in the signal\nstrength needed by the best known polynomial-time sparse PCA algorithms would\nimply that the hardness threshold for PC is subpolynomial. This is the first\ninstance of a suboptimal hardness assumption implying optimal lower bounds for\nanother problem in unsupervised learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 02:35:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-21"}

A current\ndetermined from the interplay between a fast photochemical isomerization\n(photoisomerization) process triggered by pulses and a slow thermal\nisomerization (thermalization) process arising from an overdamped environment\nis numerically evaluated. For this purpose, we employ the multi-state\nlow-temperature quantum Smoluchowski equations that allow us to simulate the\nfast quantum electronic dynamics in the overdamped environment.

This allows it to control packet delivery probabilities, and\nthereby, for example, avert imminent video outages at clients. It must however\nrespect the access point's constraints on bandwidth and average transmission\npower. The goal is to maximize video \"Quality of Experience\" (QoE), which\ndepends on several factors such as (i) outage duration when the video playback\nbuffer is empty, (ii) number of outage periods, (iii) how many frames\ndownloaded are of lower resolution, (iv) temporal variations in resolution,\netc.\n  It is shown that there exists an optimal decentralized solution where the AP\nannounces the price of energy, and each client distributedly and dynamically\nmaximizes its own QoE subject to the cost of energy. A distributed iterative\nalgorithm to solve for optimal decentralized policy is also presented. Further,\nfor the client-level QoE optimization, the optimal choice of video-resolution\nand power-level of packet transmissions has a simple monotonicity and threshold\nstructure vis-a-vis video playback buffer level. When the number of orthogonal\nchannels is less than the number of clients, there is an index policy for\nprioritizing packet transmissions. When the AP has to simply choose which\nclients' packets to transmit, the index policy is asymptotically optimal as the\nnumber of channels is scaled up with clients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 05:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-21"}

To increase eavesdropping success probability, we\npropose cognitive jamming for the monitor to change the suspicious link's\nlong-term belief on the parallel channels' distributions, and thereby induce it\nto transmit more likely over a smaller subset of unjammed channels with a lower\ntransmission rate. As the half-duplex monitor cannot eavesdrop the channel that\nit is simultaneously jamming to, our jamming design should also control the\nprobability of such \"own goal\" that occurs when the suspicious link chooses one\nof the jammed (uneavesdroppable) channels to transmit. We formulate the optimal\njamming design problem as a mixed integer nonlinear programming and show that\nit is non-convex. Nevertheless, we prove that the monitor should optimally use\nthe maximum jamming power if it decides to jam, for maximally reducing\nsuspicious link's communication rate and driving the suspicious link out of the\njammed channels. Then we manage to simplify the MINLP to integer programming\nand reveal a fundamental trade-off in deciding the number of jammed channels:\njamming more channels helps reduce the suspicious link's communication rate for\noverhearing more clearly, but increases own goal probability and thus decreases\neavesdropping success probability. Finally, we extend our study to the two-way\nsuspicious communication scenario, and show there is another interesting\ntrade-off in deciding the common jammed channels for balancing bidirectional\neavesdropping performances. Numerical results show that our optimized\njamming-assisted eavesdropping scheme greatly increase eavesdropping success\nprobability as compared with the conventional passive eavesdropping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 05:51:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-21"}

In the paper, we investigate not\nonly the seed selection problem but also the effect of SC allocation for\noptimizing the redemption rate which represents the efficiency of SC\nallocation. Accordingly, we formulate a problem named Seed Selection and SC\nallocation for Redemption Maximization (S3CRM) and prove the hardness of S3CRM.\nWe design an effective algorithm with a performance guarantee, called Seed\nSelection and Social Coupon allocation algorithm. For S3CRM, we introduce the\nnotion of marginal redemption to evaluate the efficiency of investment in seeds\nand SCs. Moreover, for a balanced investment, we develop a new graph structure\ncalled guaranteed path, to explore the opportunity to optimize the redemption\nrate.

At\nthermal equilibrium, an equation of state exists and stress is likewise\nobtained from intrinsic bulk properties; even more, stress can be calculated\nlocally. Comparable local descriptions for active systems require a particular\nconsideration of active forces. Here, we derive expressions for the stress\nexerted on a local volume of a systems of spherical active Brownian particles\n(ABPs). Using the virial theorem, we obtain two identical stress expressions, a\nstress due to momentum flux across a hypothetical plane, and a bulk stress\ninside of the local volume. In the first case, we obtain an active contribution\nto momentum transport in analogy to momentum transport in an underdamped\npassive system, and we introduce an active momentum. In the second case, a\ngenerally valid expression for the swim stress is derived. By simulations, we\ndemonstrate that the local bulk stress is identical to the wall stress of a\nconfined system for both, non-interacting ABPs as well as ABPs with\nexcluded-volume interactions. This underlines the existence of an equation of\nstate for a system of spherical ABPs. Most importantly, our calculations\ndemonstrated that active stress is not a wall (boundary) effect, but is caused\nby momentum transport. We demonstrate that the derived stress expression\npermits the calculation of the local stress in inhomogeneous systems of ABPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 07:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-21"}

This phenomenon affects\nmajor financial services, including wealth management, employee savings plans,\nasset managers, etc. Since the robo-advisory model is in its early stages, we\nestimate that robo-advisors will help to manage around $1 trillion of assets in\n2020 (OECD, 2017). And this trend is not going to stop with future generations,\nwho will live in a technology-driven and social media-based world. In the\ninvestment industry, robo-advisors face different challenges: client profiling,\ncustomization, asset pooling, liability constraints, etc. In its primary sense,\nrobo-advisory is a term for defining automated portfolio management. This\nincludes automated trading and rebalancing, but also automated portfolio\nallocation. And this last issue is certainly the most important challenge for\nrobo-advisory over the next five years. Today, in many robo-advisors, asset\nallocation is rather human-based and very far from being computer-based. The\nreason is that portfolio optimization is a very difficult task, and can lead to\noptimized mathematical solutions that are not optimal from a financial point of\nview (Michaud, 1989). The big challenge for robo-advisors is therefore to be\nable to optimize and rebalance hundreds of optimal portfolios without human\nintervention. In this paper, we show that the mean-variance optimization\napproach is mainly driven by arbitrage factors that are related to the concept\nof hedging portfolios. This is why regularization and sparsity are necessary to\ndefine robust asset allocation. However, this mathematical framework is more\ncomplex and requires understanding how norm penalties impacts portfolio\noptimization. From a numerical point of view, it also requires the\nimplementation of non-traditional algorithms based on ADMM methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 08:30:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-21"}

To limit such\nconcerns, organizations often provide analysts with aggregate time-series that\nindicate, e.g., how many people are in a location at a time interval, rather\nthan raw individual traces. In this paper, we perform a measurement study to\nunderstand Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on aggregate location\ntime-series, where an adversary tries to infer whether a specific user\ncontributed to the aggregates.\n  We find that the volume of contributed data, as well as the regularity and\nparticularity of users' mobility patterns, play a crucial role in the attack's\nsuccess.

Differentially private techniques provide reasonable accuracy only in\nvery specific settings, e.g., discovering hotspots and forecasting their\ntraffic, and more so when using weaker privacy notions like crowd-blending\nprivacy.

The trapped\npopulation of electrons is modeled based on well-known Schamel distribution\nfunction. Head-on mutual collisions of nonlinear solutions are performed in\norder to examine their collisional stability. The findings include three major\naspects: (I) These nonlinear solutions are found to be divided into three\ncategories based on their Mach numbers, i.e. stable, semi-stable and unstable.\nSemi-stable solutions indicates a smooth transition from stable to unstable\nsolutions for increasing Mach number. (II) The stability of solutions is traced\nback to a condition imposed on averaged velocities, i.e. net neutrality.

This bipolar structure acts as the seed of the\nnet-neutrality instability, which tips off the energy balance of nonlinear\nsolution during collisions. As the Mach number increases, the amplitude of\nbipolar structure grows and results in a stronger instability.

A wide\nclass of systems expected to exhibit exotic correlations are based on nanoscale\nconductors with strong spin-orbit interaction, subject to a strong external\nmagnetic field. The strength of the spin-orbit coupling is a crucial parameter\nfor the topological protection of Majorana modes as it forbids other trivial\nexcitations at low energy. The spin-orbit interaction is in principle intrinsic\nto a material. As a consequence, experimental efforts have been recently\nfocused on semiconducting nano-conductors or spin-active atomic chains\ncontacted to a superconductor. Alternatively, we show how both a spin-orbit and\na Zeeman effect can be autonomously induced by using a magnetic texture coupled\nto any low dimensional conductor, here a carbon nanotube. Transport\nspectroscopy through superconducting contacts reveals oscillations of Andreev\nlike states under a change of the magnetic texture. These oscillations are well\naccounted for by a scattering theory and are absent in a control device with no\nmagnetic texture. A large synthetic spin-orbit energy of about 1.1 meV, larger\nthan the intrinsic spin orbit energy in many other platforms, is directly\nderived from the number of oscillations. Furthermore, a robust zero energy\nstate, the hallmark of devices hosting localized Majorana modes, emerges at\nzero magnetic field. Our findings synthetize all the features for the emergence\nof Majorana modes at zero magnetic field in a controlled, local and autonomous\nfashion.

Our results further suggest that\nsocially responsible investors have leverage: a small share of 10--20\\,\\% of\nsuch moral investors is sufficient to initiate the burst of the carbon bubble,\nconsistent with the Pareto Principle. These findings demonstrate that\ndivestment has potential for contributing to decarbonization alongside other\nsocial movements and policy instruments, particularly given the credible\nimminence of strong international climate policy. Our analysis also indicates\nthe possible existence of a carbon bubble with potentially destabilizing\neffects to the economy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 10:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-21"}

This is in stark contrast to robotics. In this field, the relative\nlack of good real-world interaction models - along with very restricted sensors\nand a scarcity of suitable training data to leverage machine learning methods -\nhas so far rendered haptic exploration a largely underdeveloped skill. In the\npresent work, we connect recent advances in recurrent models of visual\nattention with previous insights about the organisation of human haptic search\nbehavior, exploratory procedures and haptic glances for a novel architecture\nthat learns a generative model of haptic exploration in a simulated\nthree-dimensional environment.

With the proposed Noisy multi-label semi-supervised dimensionality\nreduction (NMLSDR) method, the noisy multi-labels are denoised and unlabeled\ndata are labeled simultaneously via a specially designed label propagation\nalgorithm. NMLSDR then learns a projection matrix for reducing the\ndimensionality by maximizing the dependence between the enlarged and denoised\nmulti-label space and the features in the projected space.

Accurate segmentation\nof the optic disc (OD) and cup (OC) from fundus images is beneficial to\nglaucoma screening and diagnosis. Recently, convolutional neural networks\ndemonstrate promising progress in joint OD and OC segmentation. However,\naffected by the domain shift among different datasets, deep networks are\nseverely hindered in generalizing across different scanners and institutions.\nIn this paper, we present a novel patchbased Output Space Adversarial Learning\nframework (pOSAL) to jointly and robustly segment the OD and OC from different\nfundus image datasets. We first devise a lightweight and efficient segmentation\nnetwork as a backbone. Considering the specific morphology of OD and OC, a\nnovel morphology-aware segmentation loss is proposed to guide the network to\ngenerate accurate and smooth segmentation. Our pOSAL framework then exploits\nunsupervised domain adaptation to address the domain shift challenge by\nencouraging the segmentation in the target domain to be similar to the source\nones. Since the whole-segmentationbased adversarial loss is insufficient to\ndrive the network to capture segmentation details, we further design the pOSAL\nin a patch-based fashion to enable fine-grained discrimination on local\nsegmentation details. We extensively evaluate our pOSAL framework and\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in improving the segmentation performance on\nthree public retinal fundus image datasets, i.e., Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and\nREFUGE.

Then we conducted a board range of measurements on\nthe pool evolutions, labeled transactions (blocks) as well as real-time network\ntraffics, and discovered new interesting observations and features.\nSpecifically, our measurements show the following. 1) A few mining pools\nentities continuously control most of the computing resources of the Bitcoin\nnetwork. 2) Mining pools are caught in a prisoner's dilemma where mining pools\ncompete to increase their computing resources even though the unit profit of\nthe computing resource decreases. 3) Mining pools are stuck in a Malthusian\ntrap where there is a stage at which the Bitcoin incentives are inadequate for\nfeeding the exponential growth of the computing resources. 4) The market price\nand transaction fees are not sensitive to the event of halving block rewards.\n5) The block interval of empty blocks is significantly lower than the block\ninterval of non-empty blocks. 6) Feerate plays a dominating role in transaction\ncollection strategy for the top mining pools. Our measurements and analysis\nhelp to understand and improve the Bitcoin network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 13:35:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 03:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-22"}

In the context of device pairing, on\nthe other hand, the attack has received little attention outside the\ntrusted-computing community. This paper points out that most device pairing\nprotocols are vulnerable to misbinding. Device pairing protocols are\ncharacterized by lack of a-priory information, such as identifiers and\ncryptographic roots of trust, about the other endpoint. Therefore, the devices\nin pairing protocols need to be identified by the user's physical access to\nthem.

We have implemented the attacks. We also show how\nthe attacks can be found in formal models of the protocols with carefully\nformulated correspondence assertions. The formal analysis yields a new type of\ndouble misbinding attack.

First, it seems that there is a universal property:\nthe superconducting phase always has a smaller complexity than the unstable\nnormal phase below the critical temperature, which is similar to a free energy.\nWe investigate the temperature dependence of the complexity. In the low\ntemperature limit, the complexity (of formation) scales as $T^\\alpha$, where\n$\\alpha$ is a function of the complex scalar mass $m^2$, the $U(1)$ charge $q$,\nand dimension $d$. In particular, for $m^2=0$, we find $\\alpha=d-1$,\nindependent of $q$, which can be explained by the near horizon geometry of the\nlow temperature holographic superconductor. Next, we develop a general\nnumerical method to compute the time-dependent complexity by the CV conjecture.\nBy this method, we compute the time-dependent complexity of holographic\nsuperconductors. In both normal and superconducting phase, the complexity\nincreases as time goes on and the growth rate saturates to a temperature\ndependent constant. The higher the temperature is, the bigger the growth rate\nis.

In this paper we present a simple document\nlisting index for repetitive string collections of total length $n$ that lists\nthe $ndoc$ distinct documents where a pattern of length $m$ appears in time\n$\\mathcal{O}(m+ndoc \\cdot \\log n)$. We exploit the repetitiveness of the\ndocument array (i.e., the suffix array coarsened to document identifiers) to\ngrammar-compress it while precomputing the answers to nonterminals, and store\nthem in grammar-compressed form as well. Our experimental results show that our\nindex sharply outperforms existing alternatives in the space/time tradeoff map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 15:34:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-21"}

We seek to find\npotential new members of Ophiuchus and identify those surrounded by a\ncircumstellar disc. We constructed a control sample composed of 188 bona fide\nOphiuchus members. Using this sample as a reference we applied three different\ndensity-based machine learning clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, OPTICS, and\nHDBSCAN) to a sample drawn from the Gaia catalogue centred on the Ophiuchus\ncloud. The clustering analysis was applied in the five astrometric dimensions\ndefined by the three-dimensional Cartesian space and the proper motions in\nright ascension and declination. The three clustering algorithms systematically\nidentify a similar set of candidate members in a main cluster with astrometric\nproperties consistent with those of the control sample. The increased\nflexibility of the OPTICS and HDBSCAN algorithms enable these methods to\nidentify a secondary cluster. We constructed a common sample containing 391\nmember candidates including 166 new objects, which have not yet been discussed\nin the literature.

Due\nto the additional consideration of connections between examples (\\eg articles\nwith citation link tend to be in the same class), graph neural networks could\nbe more sensitive to the perturbations, since the perturbations from connected\nexamples exacerbate the impact on a target example. Adversarial Training (AT),\na dynamic regularization technique, can resist the worst-case perturbations on\ninput features and is a promising choice to improve model robustness and\ngeneralization. However, existing AT methods focus on standard classification,\nbeing less effective when training models on graph since it does not model the\nimpact from connected examples.\n  In this work, we explore adversarial training on graph, aiming to improve the\nrobustness and generalization of models learned on graph.

They flow out of kino veins,\nschizolysigenous ducts composing an anatomically distinct continuous system of\ntangentially anastomosing lacunae produced by the vascular cambium, which\nencircle the plant. Kino is secreted holocrinously into the vein lumen by a\ncambiform epithelium lined by suberized cells that separate kino veins from the\nsurrounding axial parenchyma. A model describing kino flow in eucalypts is\npresented to investigate how vein distribution and structure, as well as kino\nholocrine loading, crystallization, and viscosity affect flow. Considering\nviscosity, vein anatomy, and a time-dependent holocrine loading of kino, the\nunsteady Stokes equation was applied. Qualitatively, kino flow is similar to\nresin flow. There is an increase in flow towards the vein open end, and both\npressure and flow depend on vein dimensions, kino properties and holocrine\nloading. However, kino veins present a much smaller specific resistance to flow\ncompared to resin ducts. Also, unlike resin loading in conifers, holocrine kino\nloading is not pressure-driven. The pressure and pressure gradient required to\ndrive an equally fast flow are smaller than what is observed on the resin ducts\nof conifers.

This trend is commonly attributed to the wide adoption\nof the REST architectural principles. Still, the development of Web APIs is\nrather autonomous and it is up to the providers to decide how to implement,\nexpose and describe the Web APIs. The individual implementations are then\ncommonly documented in textual form as part of a webpage, showing a wide\nvariety in terms of content, structure and level of detail. As a result, client\napplication developers are forced to manually process and interpret the\ndocumentation. Before we can achieve a higher level of automation and can make\nany significant improvement to current practices and technologies, we need to\nreach a deeper understanding of their similarities and differences. Therefore,\nin this paper we present a thorough analysis of the most popular Web APIs\nthrough the examination of their documentation. We provide conclusions about\ncommon description forms, output types, usage of API parameters, invocation\nsupport, level of reusability, API granularity and authentication details. The\ncollected data builds a solid foundation for identifying deficiencies and can\nbe used as a basis for devising common standards and guidelines for Web API\ndevelopment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 12:36:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-28"}

This work is motivated by potential power saving\nopportunity arising from the fact that heartbeat intervals can be detected\nenergy-efficiently using inexpensive and power-efficient piezo sensors, which\nobviates the need to employ complex heartbeat monitors such as\nElectrocardiogram or Photoplethysmogram. Indeed, our experiments show that\npiezo sensors can measure heartbeat intervals on many different body locations\nincluding chest, wrist, waist, neck and ankle. Unfortunately, we also discover\nthat the heartbeat interval signal captured by piezo vibration sensors has low\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) because they are not designed as precision\nheartbeat monitors, which becomes the key challenge for H2B. To overcome this\nproblem, we first apply a quantile function-based quantization method to fully\nextract the useful entropy from the noisy piezo measurements.
