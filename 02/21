We\nshow that our model performs almost as well as the monolingual models by using\nsix times fewer parameters, and is capable of better adaptation to languages\nnot seen during training in a low resource scenario.

A key property of all these models, which is also an important\nreason for their popularity, is that they are presumed to be very robust, since\nthey are simple, randomized, and, crucially, do not utilize explicitly the\nglobal structure of the underlying graph. While sporadic results exist, there\nhas been no systematic theoretical treatment quantifying the robustness of\nthese models. Here we investigate this question with respect to two orthogonal\naspects: (adversarial) modifications of the underlying graph and message\ntransmission failures.\n  We explore in particular the following notion of Local Resilience: beginning\nwith a graph, we investigate up to which fraction of the edges an adversary has\nto be allowed to delete at each vertex, so that the protocols need\nsignificantly more rounds to broadcast the information. Our main findings\nestablish a separation among the three models. It turns out that Pull is robust\nwith respect to all parameters that we consider. On the other hand, Push may\nslow down significantly, even if the adversary is allowed to modify the degrees\nof the vertices by an arbitrarily small positive fraction only. Finally,\nPush&Pull is robust when no message transmission failures are considered,\notherwise it may be slowed down.\n  On the technical side, we develop two novel methods for the analysis of\nrandomized rumour spreading protocols. First, we exploit the notion of\nself-bounding functions to facilitate significantly the round-based analysis:\nwe show that for any graph the variance of the growth of informed vertices is\nbounded by its expectation, so that concentration results follow immediately.\nSecond, in order to control adversarial modifications of the graph we make use\nof a powerful tool from extremal graph theory, namely Szemer\\`edi's Regularity\nLemma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 16:07:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 15:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

In sociology the sum of\n(social) resources available to a person through their social network is often\ndescribed as social capital. In this article, we look at social capital from a\ndifferent angle. Instead of evaluating the advantage that people have because\nof their membership in a certain group, we investigate various ways to infer\nthe social capital a person adds or may add to the network, their contributive\nsocial capital (CSC). As there is no consensus in the literature on what the\nsocial capital of a person exactly consists of, we look at various related\nproperties: expertise, reputation, trustworthiness, and influence. The analysis\nof these features is investigated for five different sources of online data:\nmicroblogging (e.g., Twitter), social networking platforms (e.g., Facebook),\ndirect communication (e.g., email), scientometrics, and threaded discussion\nboards (e.g., Reddit).

The machine learning approaches, such as straightforward\nclassifiers (e.g., support vector machines) use ground truths that are\nconnected to social capital.

Although some of their properties are understood, Q-functions\ngenerating optimal policies for continuous problems are usually hard to\ncompute. Even when a system model is available, optimal control is generally\ndifficult to achieve except in rare cases where an analytical solution happens\nto exist, or an explicit exact solution can be computed. It is typically\nnecessary to discretize the state and action spaces, or parameterize the\nQ-function with a basis that can be hard to select a priori.

The IRS (ITS) consists of a large\nnumber of low-cost and energy-efficient passive antenna elements which are able\nto reflect (transmit) a phase-shifted version of the incident electromagnetic\nfield. Similar to lens array (LA) antennas, IRS/ITS-aided antenna architectures\nare energy efficient due to the almost lossless over-the-air connection between\nthe active antennas and the intelligent surface. However, unlike for LA\nantennas, for which the number of active antennas has to linearly grow with the\nnumber of passive elements (i.e., the lens aperture) due to the\nnon-reconfigurablility (i.e., non-intelligence) of the lens, for IRS/ITS-aided\nantennas, the reconfigurablility of the IRS/ITS facilitates scaling up the\nnumber of radiating passive elements without increasing the number of costly\nand bulky active antennas.

A natural design choice to\nmaximize reliability and minimize retransmission is to select the lowest\nallowed target error rate. However, the overall latency is the sum of queueing\nlatency and retransmission latency, hence choosing the lowest target error rate\ndoes not always minimize the overall latency. In this paper, we minimize the\noverall latency by jointly designing the target error rate and transmission\nrate adaptation, which leads to a fundamental tradeoff point between queueing\nand retransmission latency. This design problem can be formulated as a Markov\ndecision process, which is theoretically optimal, but its complexity is\nprohibitively high for real-system deployments. We managed to develop a\nlow-complexity closed-form policy named Large-arraY Reliability and Rate\nControl (LYRRC), which is proven to be asymptotically latency-optimal as the\nnumber of antennas increases. In LYRRC, the transmission rate is twice of the\narrival rate, and the target error rate is a function of the antenna number,\narrival rate, and channel estimation error. With simulated and measured\nchannels, our evaluations find LYRRC satisfies the latency and reliability\nrequirements of URLLC in all the tested scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 17:47:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 19:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-03"}

These\ninclude non-local games, tasks with quantum communication between players and\nreferee, and simulating bipartite unitaries or communication channels. By\ncontrast, we prove that the bounded-error entanglement-assisted quantum\ncommunication complexity of a function cannot be improved by more than a\nconstant factor by replacing maximally entangled states with arbitrary\nentangled states.

If a logical quantum system is encoded into\n$n$ physical subsystems, we say that the code is covariant with respect to a\nsymmetry group $G$ if a $G$ transformation on the logical system can be\nrealized by performing transformations on the individual subsystems. For a\n$G$-covariant code with $G$ a continuous group, we derive a lower bound on the\nerror correction infidelity following erasure of a subsystem.

We exhibit codes achieving approximately the same scaling\nof infidelity with $n$ or $d$ as the lower bound. Leveraging tools from\nrepresentation theory, we prove an approximate version of the Eastin-Knill\ntheorem: If a code admits a universal set of transversal gates and corrects\nerasure with fixed accuracy, then, for each logical qubit, we need a number of\nphysical qubits per subsystem that is inversely proportional to the error\nparameter.

We systematically construct codes\ncovariant with respect to general groups, obtaining natural generalizations of\nqubit codes to, for instance, oscillators and rotors. In the context of the\nAdS/CFT correspondence, our approach provides insight into how time evolution\nin the bulk corresponds to time evolution on the boundary without violating the\nEastin-Knill theorem, and our five-rotor code can be stacked to form a\ncovariant holographic code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

We also demonstrate the new\nimplementations of various natal-kick mechanisms on NSs and BHs such as the\n'convection-asymmetry-driven', 'collapse-asymmetry-driven', and\n'neutrino-emission-driven' kicks, in addition to a fully consistent\nimplementation of the standard, fallback-dependent, momentum-conserving natal\nkick. We find that the SN material fallback causes the convection-asymmetry\nkick to effectively retain similar number and mass of BHs in clusters as for\nthe standard, momentum-conserving kick. The collapse-asymmetry kick would cause\nnearly all BHs to retain in clusters irrespective of remnant formation model\nand metallicity, whereas the inference of a large number of BHs in GCs would\npotentially rule out the neutrino-driven kick mechanism. Pre-SN mergers of\nmassive primordial binaries would cause BH masses to deviate from the\nsingle-star ZAMS mass-remnant mass relation. Such mergers, at low\nmetallicities, can produce low-spinning BHs within the PSN mass gap that can be\nretained in a stellar cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 19:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 11:26:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

Dissolved nitrogen oxide anions\n(NO$_{X}^{-}$), in particular nitrate (NO$_{3}^{-}$) and nitrite\n(NO$_{2}^{-}$), have been invoked in diverse origins-of-life chemistry, from\nthe oligomerization of RNA to the emergence of protometabolism. Recent work has\ncalculated the supply of NO$_{X}^{-}$ from the prebiotic atmosphere to the\nocean, and reported steady-state [NO$_{X}^{-}$] to be high across all plausible\nparameter space. These findings rest on the assumption that NO$_{X}^{-}$ is\nstable in natural waters unless processed at a hydrothermal vent. Here, we show\nthat NO$_{X}^{-}$ is unstable in the reducing environment of early Earth. Sinks\ndue to UV photolysis and reactions with reduced iron (Fe$^{2+}$) suppress\n[NO$_{X}^{-}$] by several orders of magnitude relative to past predictions.

These findings inform the kind of prebiotic chemistries that would\nhave been possible on early Earth. We discuss the implications for proposed\nprebiotic chemistries, and highlight the need for further studies of\nNO$_{X}^{-}$ kinetics to reduce the considerable uncertainties in predicting\n[NO$_{X}^{-}$] on early Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 19:20:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

For the latter,\ndynamic arrest is possible without a growing static correlation length, and we\nsketch the derivation of a key result: the parabolic law for the structural\nrelaxation time.

However, such\napproximations may not work well when non-smooth loss functions are involved.\nAs a case in point, approximate cross validation schemes for penalized quantile\nregression do not work well for extreme quantiles. In this paper, we propose a\nnew algorithm to compute the leave-one-out cross validation scores exactly for\nquantile regression with ridge penalty through a case-weight adjusted solution\npath. Resorting to the homotopy technique in optimization, we introduce a case\nweight for each individual data point as a continuous embedding parameter and\ndecrease the weight gradually from one to zero to link the estimators based on\nthe full data and those with a case deleted. This allows us to design a\nsolution path algorithm to compute all leave-one-out estimators very\nefficiently from the full-data solution.

In order to\nconsider these requirements Generation Expansion Planning (GEP) models have\nrecently incorporated Unit Commitment (UC) constraints, using traditional\nenergy-based formulations. However, recent studies have shown that energy-based\nUC formulations overestimate the actual flexibility of the system. Instead,\npower-based UC models overcome these problems by correctly modeling ramping\nconstraints and operating reserves. This paper proposes a power-based GEP-UC\nmodel that improves the existing models. The proposed model optimizes\ninvestment decisions on vRES, Energy Storage Systems (ESS), and thermal\ntechnologies. In addition, it includes real-time flexibility requirements, and\nthe flexibility provided by ESS, as well as other UC constraints, e.g., minimum\nup/down times, startup and shutdown power trajectories, network constraints.\nThe results show that power-based model uses the installed investments more\neffectively than the energy-based models because it more accurately represents\nflexibility capabilities and system requirements. For instance, the power-based\nmodel obtains less investment (6-12%) and yet it uses more efficiently this\ninvestment because operating cost is also lower (2-8%) in a real-time\nvalidation. We also propose a semi-relaxed power-based GEP-UC model, which is\nat least 10 times faster than its full-integer version and without\nsignificantly losing accuracy in the results (less than 0.2% error).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 21:12:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-22"}

We formulate a stochastic local interaction model for\nregular and scattered space-time data that incorporates interactions within\ncontrolled space-time neighborhoods. The strength of the interaction and the\nsize of the neighborhood are defined by means of kernel functions and adaptive\nlocal bandwidths.

To improve preparedness, we study\nhistorical measles data both pre- and post-vaccine, and design new methodology\nto forecast measles counts with uncertainty quantification. We propose to model\nthe disease counts as an integer-valued functional time series: measles counts\nare a function of time-of-year and time-ordered by year. The counts are modeled\nusing a negative-binomial distribution conditional on a real-valued latent\nprocess, which accounts for the overdispersion observed in the data.

In this paper, we perform a\ndetailed performance analysis of the transient gradual typing approach\nimplemented in Reticulated Python, a gradually typed variant of Python. The\ntransient approach inserts lightweight checks throughout a program rather than\ninstalling proxies on higher order values. We show that, when running\nReticulated Python and the transient approach on CPython, performance decreases\nas programs evolve from dynamic to static types, up to a 6x slowdown compared\nto equivalent Python programs.\n  To reduce this overhead, we design a static analysis and optimization that\nremoves redundant runtime checks. The optimization employs a static type\ninference algorithm that solves traditional subtyping constraints and also a\nnew kind of check constraint. We evaluate the resulting performance and find\nthat for many programs, the efficiency of partially typed programs is close to\ntheir untyped counterparts, removing most of the slowdown of transient checks.\nFinally, we measure the efficiency of Reticulated Python programs when running\non PyPy, a tracing JIT.

The\nregion where the segment can be found is contained within the input RoI mask.\nFull image segmentation can be achieved by running this net sequentially,\nregion-by-region on the image, and stitching the output segments into a single\nsegmentation map.

In this\npaper, we propose a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ)-based real-time\nremote estimation framework for linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamic systems.\nConsidering the estimation quality of such a system, there is a fundamental\ntradeoff between the reliability and freshness of the sensor's measurement\ntransmission. When a failed transmission occurs, the sensor can either\nretransmit the previous old measurement such that the receiver can obtain a\nmore reliable old measurement, or transmit a new but less reliable measurement.\nTo design the optimal decision, we formulate a new problem to optimize the\nsensor's online decision policy, i.e., to retransmit or not, depending on both\nthe current estimation quality of the remote estimator and the current number\nof retransmissions of the sensor, so as to minimize the long-term remote\nestimation mean-squared error (MSE). This problem is non-trivial. In\nparticular, it is not clear what the condition is in terms of the communication\nchannel quality and the LTI system parameters, to ensure that the long-term\nestimation MSE can be bounded. We give a sufficient condition of the existence\nof a stationary and deterministic optimal policy that stabilizes the remote\nestimation system and minimizes the MSE.

Applying an external source to these memristor\ncircuits, they exhibit complex behavior, such as chaos and non-periodic\noscillation. If the memristor circuits have an integral invariant, they can\nexhibit quasi-periodic or non-periodic behavior by the sinusoidal forcing.\nTheir behavior greatly depends on the initial conditions, the parameters, and\nthe maximum step size of the numerical integration.

This observation leads to a\nfundamental question: For IoT applications, can one develop a new brand of\nneural network structures that synthesize features inspired not only by the\nbiology of human perception but also by the fundamental nature of physics?\nHence, in this paper, instead of using conventional building blocks (e.g.,\nconvolutional and recurrent layers), we propose a new foundational neural\nnetwork building block, the Short-Time Fourier Neural Network (STFNet). It\nintegrates a widely-used time-frequency analysis method, the Short-Time Fourier\nTransform, into data processing to learn features directly in the frequency\ndomain, where the physics of underlying phenomena leave better foot-prints.\nSTFNets bring additional flexibility to time-frequency analysis by offering\nnovel nonlinear learnable operations that are spectral-compatible.

Whole heart segmentation (WHS), which delineates substructures of\nthe heart, can be very valuable for modeling and analysis of the anatomy and\nfunctions of the heart. However, automating this segmentation can be arduous\ndue to the large variation of the heart shape, and different image qualities of\nthe clinical data. To achieve this goal, a set of training data is generally\nneeded for constructing priors or for training.

This manuscript presents the\nmethodologies and evaluation results for the WHS algorithms selected from the\nsubmissions to the Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation (MM-WHS) challenge,\nin conjunction with MICCAI 2017. The challenge provides 120 three-dimensional\ncardiac images covering the whole heart, including 60 CT and 60 MRI volumes,\nall acquired in clinical environments with manual delineation.

After locating and\ntracking human eye using SeetaFace engine and KCF tracker respectively, a\nmodified LSTM model able to capture the multi-scale temporal information is\nproposed to execute eyeblink verification. A feature extraction approach that\nreveals appearance and motion characteristics simultaneously is also proposed.\nThe experiments on HUST-LEBW reveal the superiority and efficiency of our\napproach. It also verifies that, the existing eyeblink detection methods cannot\nachieve satisfactory performance in the wild.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 07:15:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 May 2019 05:38:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 12:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-19"}

The purpose of the proposed schemes is to obtain a high\nclassification accuracy with a reduced number of training data through the use\nof detected contours in X-ray images. There are two contour-based fracture\ndetection schemes. The first is the Standard Contour Histogram Feature-Based\n(CHFB) and the second is the improved CHFB scheme. The difference between the\ntwo schemes is the removal of the surrounding detected flesh contours from the\nleg region in the improved CHFB scheme. The flesh contours are automatically\nclassified as non-fractures. The contours are further refined to give a precise\nrepresentation of the image edge objects. A total of 19 features are extracted\nfrom each refined contour. 8 out of the 19 features are based on the number of\noccurrences for particular detected gradients in the contour. Moreover, the\noccurrence of the 0-degree gradient in the contours are employed for the\nseparation of the knee, leg and foot region. The features are a summary\nrepresentation of the contour, in which it is used as inputs into the\nArtificial Neural Network (ANN).

In the image\nclassification setting, such distances measure the cost of moving pixel mass,\nwhich naturally cover \"standard\" image manipulations such as scaling, rotation,\ntranslation, and distortion (and can potentially be applied to other settings\nas well).

All current architecture designs necessitate a 2D arrangement of\nsuperconducting qubits with nearest neighbour interactions, compatible with\npowerful quantum error correction using the surface code. A major hurdle for\nscalability in superconducting systems is the so called wiring problem, where\nqubits internal to a chip-set become inaccessible for external control/readout\nlines. Current approaches resort to intricate and exotic 3D wiring and\npackaging technology which is a significant engineering challenge to realize,\nwhile maintaining qubit fidelity. Here we solve this problem and present a\nmodified superconducting scalable micro-architecture that does not require any\n3D external line technology and reverts back to a completely planar design.\nThis is enabled by a new pseudo-2D resonator network that provides inter-qubit\nconnections via airbridges. We carried out experiments to examine the\nfeasibility of the newly introduced airbridge component. The measured quality\nfactor of these new inter-qubit resonators is sufficient for high fidelity\ngates, below the threshold for the surface code, with negligible measured\ncross-talk. The resulting physical separation of the external wirings and the\ninter-qubit connections on-chip should reduce cross-talk and decoherence as the\nchip-set increases in size. This result demonstrates that a large-scale, fully\nerror corrected quantum computer can be constructed by monolithic integration\ntechnologies without additional overhead and without special packaging\nknow-hows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 08:42:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 08:03:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 11:36:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Dark sector states charged\nunder the dark force can give a macroscopic charge to astronomical bodies. Yet\nthe requirement of having gravitationally bounded stars limits this charge to\nnegligible values if the force has a sizeable strength. Gravitational tests are\nonly possible if the dark force is weaker than gravity. By solving the\nEinstein-Maxwell field equations, we study in detail an explicit model for dark\ncharge generation and separation in a neutron star. Charged states originate\nfrom the decay of neutrons inside the star into three dark fermions; we show\nthat in this model the equation of state is consistent with limits on neutron\nstar masses and tidal deformability. We find that while the dark force can be\nobserved in binary mergers (making them an optimal observational test even\nthough with limited precision), it is Debye screened in binary pulsars (for\nwhich more precise data exist). The emitted radiation in the inspiral phase of\na binary system is modified and the dark force tested at the level of the\nuncertainty of the experimental detection.

One of the main contributors to latency in cellular\nnetworks is the reservation-based access, which involves lengthy and\nresource-inefficient signaling exchanges. An alternative is to use grant-free\naccess, in which there is no resource reservation. A handful of recent works\ninvestigated how to fulfill reliability and latency requirements with different\nflavors of grant-free solutions. However, the resource efficiency, i.e., the\nthroughput, has been only the secondary focus. In this work, we formulate the\nthroughput of grant-free access under reliability-latency constraints, when the\nactual number of arrived users or only the arrival distribution are known. We\ninvestigate how these different levels of knowledge about the arrival process\ninfluence throughput performance of framed slotted ALOHA with $K$-multipacket\nreception, for the Poisson and Beta arrivals. We show that the throughput under\nreliability-latency requirements can be significantly improved for the higher\nexpected load of the access network, if the actual number of arrived users is\nknown. This insight motivates the use of techniques for the estimation of the\nnumber of arrived users, as this knowledge is not readily available in\ngrant-free access.

The\ngoal of this paper is to improve our knowledge of the erosion of exoplanetary\natmospheres through radiation from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) undergoing\nan active galactic nucleus (AGN) phase. To this end, we extended the well-known\nenergy-limited mass-loss model to include the case of radiation from AGNs. We\nset the fraction of incident power $\\epsilon$ available to heat the atmosphere\nas either constant ($\\epsilon = 0.1$) or flux dependent ($\\epsilon =\n\\epsilon(F_{\\textrm{XUV}})$). We calculated the possible atmospheric mass loss\nfor 54 known exoplanets (of which 16 are hot Jupiters residing in the Galactic\nbulge and 38 are Earth-like planets (EPs)) due to radiation from the Milky\nWay's (MW) central SMBH, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), and from a set of 107,220\nAGNs generated using the 33,350 AGNs at $z < 0.5$ of the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey database. We found that planets in the Galactic bulge might have lost up\nto several Earth atmospheres in mass during the AGN phase of Sgr A*, while the\nEPs are at a safe distance from Sgr A* ($> 7$ kpc) and have not undergone any\natmospheric erosion in their lifetimes. We also found that the MW EPs might\nexperience a mass loss up to $\\sim 15$ times the Mars atmosphere over a period\nof $50$ Myr as the result of exposure to the cumulative extreme-UV flux\n$F_{\\textrm{XUV}}$ from the AGNs up to $z = 0.5$.

For\nrealistic values of the momentum relaxation times, the intrinsic\n(Elliott--Yafet) spin relaxation times are hundreds of picoseconds to\nnanoseconds. Applying a transverse electric field (simulating gating and\nsubstrates) generates extrinsic $C_{2v}$ symmetric spin-orbit fields in\nphosphorene, which activate the D'yakonov--Perel' mechanism for spin\nrelaxation.

We\nshow that in order to recover the simplified exciton-photon model that is\ntypically used to describe polaritons, one must correctly define the\nexciton-photon detuning and exciton-photon (Rabi) coupling in terms of the bare\nmicroscopic parameters. For the case of unscreened Coulomb interactions, we\nfind that the exciton-photon detuning is strongly shifted from its bare value\nin a manner akin to renormalization in quantum electrodynamics. Within the\nrenormalized theory, we exactly solve the problem of a single exciton-polariton\nfor the first time and obtain the full spectral response of the microcavity. In\nparticular, we find that the electron-hole wave function of the polariton can\nbe significantly modified by the very strong Rabi couplings achieved in current\nexperiments. Our microscopic approach furthermore allows us to obtain the\neffective interaction between identical polaritons for any light-matter\ncoupling. Crucially, we show that the standard treatment of polariton-polariton\ninteractions in the very strong coupling regime is incorrect, since it neglects\nthe light-induced modification of the exciton size and thus greatly\noverestimates the effect of Pauli exclusion on the Rabi coupling, i.e., the\nsaturation of exciton oscillator strength.

As the mutant\npopulation grows, cell division becomes less probable, and it may in fact turn\nless likely than that of residents. Our analysis rests on the assumption of the\nprocess starting from resident population, with sizes proportional to a large\ncarrying capacity $K$.

To address this issue, we turn to Hawking's \"principle of\nignorance\", which says that, for an observer with limited information, all\ndescriptions that are consistent with known physics are equally valid. We\ncompare three different observers who view the BH from the outside and agree on\nthe external Schwarzschild geometry. First, the modernist, who accepts the\nclassical BH as the final state of gravitational collapse, the singularity\ntheorems that underlie this premise and the central singularity that the\ntheorems predict. The modernist is willing to describe matter in terms of\nquantum fields in curved space but insists on (semi)classical gravity. Second\nis the skeptic, who wishes to evade any singular behavior by finding a loophole\nto the singularity theorems within the realm of classical general relativity\n(GR). The third is a postmodernist who similarly wants to circumvent the\nsingularity theorems but is willing to invoke exotic quantum physics in the\ngravitational and/or matter sector to do so. The postmodern view suggests that\nthe uncertainty principle can stabilize a classically singular BH in a similar\nmanner to the stabilization of the classically unstable hydrogen atom: Strong\nquantum effects in the matter and gravitational sectors resolve the would-be\nsingularity over horizon-sized length scales. The postmodern picture then\nrequires a significant departure from (semi)classical gravity, as well as some\nexotic matter beyond the standard model of particle physics (SM). We find that\nonly the postmodern framework is consistent with what is known so far about BH\nphysics and conclude that a valid description of the BH interior needs matter\nbeyond the SM and gravitational physics beyond (semi)classical GR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 12:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

This paper attempts to address this issue, at least to some\nextent, by providing accessible descriptions of the most cited nature-inspired\nalgorithms published in the last twenty years. It also discusses commonalities\nbetween these algorithms and more classical nature-inspired metaheuristics such\nas evolutionary algorithms and particle swarm optimisation, and finishes with a\ndiscussion of future directions for the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 12:26:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:18:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-26"}

By exploiting a\nspatial proximity criterion, the dynamics of a set of fluid particles is\ngeometrized into a time-varying weighted network. Specifically, a numerically\nsolved turbulent channel flow is employed as an exemplifying case. We show that\nthe time-varying network is able to clearly describe the particle swarm\ndynamics, in a parametrically robust and computationally inexpensive way. The\nnetwork formalism enables to straightforwardly identify transient and long-term\nflow regimes, the interplay between turbulent mixing and mean flow advection,\nand the occurrence of proximity events among particles. Thanks to their\nversatility and ability to highlight significant flow features, complex\nnetworks represent a suitable tool for Lagrangian investigations of turbulence\nmixing. The present application of complex networks offers a powerful resource\nfor Lagrangian analysis of turbulent flows, thus providing a further step in\nbuilding bridges between turbulence research and network science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 12:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

A major trend in automata network theory is to\nunderstand how the interaction graph affects dynamical properties of $f$. In\nthis work we introduce the following property called expansivity: the\nobservation of the sequence of states at any given node is sufficient to\ndetermine the initial configuration of the whole network. Our main result is a\ncharacterization of interaction graphs that allow expansivity. Moreover, we\nshow that this property is generic among linear automata networks over such\ngraphs with large enough alphabet.

In this paper, we aim to\ninvestigate a practical problem of fashion recommendation by answering the\nquestion \"which item should we select to match with the given fashion items and\nform a compatible outfit\". The key to this problem is to estimate the outfit\ncompatibility. Previous works which focus on the compatibility of two items or\nrepresent an outfit as a sequence fail to make full use of the complex\nrelations among items in an outfit. To remedy this, we propose to represent an\noutfit as a graph. In particular, we construct a Fashion Graph, where each node\nrepresents a category and each edge represents interaction between two\ncategories. Accordingly, each outfit can be represented as a subgraph by\nputting items into their corresponding category nodes. To infer the outfit\ncompatibility from such a graph, we propose Node-wise Graph Neural Networks\n(NGNN) which can better model node interactions and learn better node\nrepresentations. In NGNN, the node interaction on each edge is different, which\nis determined by parameters correlated to the two connected nodes. An attention\nmechanism is utilized to calculate the outfit compatibility score with learned\nnode representations. NGNN can not only be used to model outfit compatibility\nfrom visual or textual modality but also from multiple modalities. We conduct\nexperiments on two tasks: (1) Fill-in-the-blank: suggesting an item that\nmatches with existing components of outfit; (2) Compatibility prediction:\npredicting the compatibility scores of given outfits. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the great superiority of our proposed method over others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 12:50:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-22"}

This process is performed about 100 times per wafer, at a\nrate of over a hundred wafers an hour. During this process, a certain\npercentage of the light energy is converted into heat in the wafer. In turn,\nthis heat causes the wafer to deform which increases the overlay error, and as\na result, reduces the manufacturing yield. To alleviate this, we propose a firm\nreal-time control system that uses a wafer heat feed-forward model to\ncompensate for the wafer deformation. The model calculates the expected wafer\ndeformation, and then, compensates for that by adjusting the light projection\nand/or the wafer movement.

Put simply, in this work we show that the most powerful known\ntechniques for fault-tolerant and gradient clock synchronization are\ncompatible, in the sense that the best of both worlds can be achieved\nsimultaneously.\n  Concretely, we combine the Lynch-Welch algorithm [Welch1988] for\nsynchronizing a clique of $n$ nodes despite up to $f<n/3$ Byzantine faults with\nthe gradient clock synchronization (GCS) algorithm by Lenzen et al.\n[Lenzen2010] in order to render the latter resilient to faults.

In this paper, we retrieve knowledge from\nexternal knowledge source to enhance the semantic representation of short\ntexts. We take conceptual information as a kind of knowledge and incorporate it\ninto deep neural networks. For the purpose of measuring the importance of\nknowledge, we introduce attention mechanisms and propose deep Short Text\nClassification with Knowledge powered Attention (STCKA). We utilize Concept\ntowards Short Text (C- ST) attention and Concept towards Concept Set (C-CS)\nattention to acquire the weight of concepts from two aspects. And we classify a\nshort text with the help of conceptual information. Unlike traditional\napproaches, our model acts like a human being who has intrinsic ability to make\ndecisions based on observation (i.e., training data for machines) and pays more\nattention to important knowledge. We also conduct extensive experiments on four\npublic datasets for different tasks.

However, there\nare uncertainties regarding CO2 fluxes for semi-arid ecosystems in Africa,\nparticularly savannas and dry tropical woodlands. In order to improve on\nexisting remote-sensing based methods for estimating carbon uptake across\nsemi-arid Africa we applied and tested the recently developed plant phenology\nindex (PPI). We developed a PPI-based model estimating gross primary\nproductivity (GPP) that accounts for canopy water stress, and compared it\nagainst three other Earth observation-based GPP models: the temperature and\ngreenness model, the greenness and radiation model and a light use efficiency\nmodel. The models were evaluated against in situ data from four semi-arid sites\nin Africa with varying tree canopy cover (3 to 65 percent). Evaluation results\nfrom the four GPP models showed reasonable agreement with in situ GPP measured\nfrom eddy covariance flux towers (EC GPP) based on coefficient of variation,\nroot-mean-square error, and Bayesian information criterion. The PPI-based GPP\nmodel was able to capture the magnitude of EC GPP better than the other tested\nmodels. The results of this study show that a PPI-based GPP model is a\npromising tool for the estimation of GPP in the semi-arid ecosystems of Africa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 14:04:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-22"}

In the\nexperiment, we show that our proposed approach enables full-text search engines\nto achieve significant speed-ups over its state-of-the-art term match approach\nfor NNS within binary codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 19:31:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 00:38:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}

We propose a method to quantify the importance of\ndifferent components in the pipeline, by computing an error contribution\nrelative to an agnostic choice of computational steps, algorithms and\nhyperparameters. We also propose a methodology to quantify the propagation of\nerror from individual components of the pipeline with the help of a naive set\nof benchmark algorithms not involved in the pipeline. We demonstrate our\nmethodology on image classification pipelines. The agnostic and naive\nmethodologies quantify the error contribution and propagation respectively from\nthe computational steps, algorithms and hyperparameters in the image\nclassification pipeline. We show that algorithm selection and hyperparameter\noptimization methods like grid search, random search and Bayesian optimization\ncan be used to quantify the error contribution and propagation, and that random\nsearch is able to quantify them more accurately than Bayesian optimization.\nThis methodology can be used by domain experts to understand machine learning\nand data analysis pipelines in terms of their individual components, which can\nhelp in prioritizing different components of the pipeline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 14:42:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-04"}

Event reconstruction,\nwhich allows investigators to understand the timeline of a crime, is one of the\nmost important step of a DI process. This complex task requires exploration of\na large amount of events due to the pervasiveness of new technologies nowadays.\nAny evidence produced at the end of the investigative process must also meet\nthe requirements of the courts, such as reproducibility, verifiability,\nvalidation, etc. For this purpose, we propose a new methodology, supported by\ntheoretical concepts, that can assist investigators through the whole process\nincluding the construction and the interpretation of the events describing the\ncase. The proposed approach is based on a model which integrates knowledge of\nexperts from the fields of digital forensics and software development to allow\na semantically rich representation of events related to the incident. The main\npurpose of this model is to allow the analysis of these events in an automatic\nand efficient way.

We find that under a wide range of conditions and datasets, the\nperformance of a distributed Apriori-like algorithm is not related to global\nstrategies of pruning since the performance of the local Apriori generation is\nusually characterized by relatively high success rates of candidate sets\nfrequency at low levels which switch to very low rates at some stage, and often\ndrops to zero.

Our physical model includes the atmosphere, the window, and the\nbackwall that are all in the thermal equilibrium with each other, and that can\nexchange energy via radiative heat transfer or convection. Moreover, we use a\nsimplified two-state model for the optical properties of an atmosphere and a\nwindow material which assumes two distinct sets of the optical\nreflection/absorption/transmission parameters in the visible/near-IR versus\nmid-IR spectral ranges. Furthermore, we have distinguished the design goals for\nthe partially transparent windows and radiative coolers and provided optimal\nchoice for the material parameters to realize these goals. Thus, radiative\ncoolers are normally non-transparent in the visible, and the main goal is to\ndesign a cooler with the temperature of its dark side as low as possible\ncompared to that of the atmosphere. For the radiative windows, however, their\nsurfaces are necessarily partially transparent in the visible. In the cooling\nmode, therefore, the main question is about the maximal visible light\ntransmission through the window at which the temperature on the window somber\nside does not exceed that of the atmosphere.
