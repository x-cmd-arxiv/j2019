The goal of\nstudying these objects together is that, although they have roughly similar\nintermediate excitation and evolution of central stars (CSs), they display very\ndifferent evolution in their nebular structure which needs to be understood.\nThe morphologies and ionisation structures of the objects are investigated\nusing a set of emission-line maps representative of the different ionisation\nzones. We use those in order to construct two-zone self-consistent\nphotoionisation models for each nebula to determine new model-dependent\ndistances, progenitor luminosities, effective temperatures and CS masses. The\nphysical conditions, chemical compositions, and expansion velocities and ages\nof these nebulae are derived. In Hen 2-7 we discover a strong poleward-directed\njet from the presumed binary CS. Oxygen and nitrogen abundances derived from\nboth collisionally excited and recombination lines reveal that PB4 displays an\nextreme abundance discrepancy factor, and we present evidence that this is\ncaused by uorescent pumping of the OII ion by the EUV continuum of an\ninteracting binary CS, rather than by recombination of the OIII ion. Both IC\n2501 and PB4 were classified by others as Weak Emission Line Stars (WELS).\nHowever, our emission line maps show that their recombination lines are\nspatially extended in both objects, and are therefore of nebular rather than CS\norigin. Given that we have found this result in a number of other PNe, this\nresult casts further doubt on the reliability, or even the reality, of the WELS\nclassification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2019 16:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

In this paper, we observe that local minima of\nmodern deep networks are more than being flat or sharp. Specifically, at a\nlocal minimum there exist many asymmetric directions such that the loss\nincreases abruptly along one side, and slowly along the opposite side--we\nformally define such minima as asymmetric valleys. Under mild assumptions, we\nprove that for asymmetric valleys, a solution biased towards the flat side\ngeneralizes better than the exact minimizer.

But when the charge distribution of a\nsingle solute can overlap with the intramolecular charge distribution of\nsolvent molecules, as is the case in electron holography, for example, the\nBethe potential is needed when comparing to experiment. Our work may also\nprovide insight into the validity of \"extra thermodynamic assumptions\"\ntraditionally made during the experimental determination of single ion\nsolvation free energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2019 20:10:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 14:15:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

In particular, caches play a key role in the\ncloud due to the nature of large-scale, data-intensive processing. One of the\nkey challenges for the cloud providers is how to share the caching capacity\namong tenants, under the circumstance that each often requires a different\ndegree of quality of service (QoS) with respect to data access performance. The\ninvariant is that the individual tenants' QoS requirements should be satisfied\nwhile the cache usage is optimized in a system-wide manner. In this paper, we\nintroduce a learning-based approach for dynamic cache management in a cloud,\nwhich is based on the estimation of data access pattern of a tenant and the\nprediction of cache performance for the access pattern in question. We consider\na variety of probability distributions to estimate the data access pattern, and\nexamine a set of learning-based regression techniques to predict the cache hit\nrate for the access pattern. The predicted cache hit rate is then used to make\na decision whether reallocating cache space is needed to meet the QoS\nrequirement for the tenant. Our experimental results with an extensive set of\nsynthetic traces and the YCSB benchmark show that the proposed method\nconsistently optimizes the cache space while satisfying the QoS requirement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2019 21:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

Prompted by the increasing\ncomplexity of power systems, decentralized IoT solutions are emerging, which\narrange local communities into transactive microgrids. The core functionality\nof these solutions is to provide mechanisms for matching producers with\nconsumers while ensuring system safety. However, there are multiple challenges\nthat these solutions still face: privacy, trust, and resilience. The privacy\nchallenge arises because the time series of production and consumption data for\neach participant is sensitive and may be used to infer personal information.\nTrust is an issue because a producer or consumer can renege on the promised\nenergy transfer.

The common method for\nidentifying proteins and characterising their amino acid sequences is to digest\nthe proteins into peptides, analyse the peptides using mass spectrometry and\nassign the resulting tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) to peptides using database\nsearch tools. However, database search algorithms are highly dependent on a\nreference protein database and they cannot identify peptides and proteins not\nincluded in the database. Therefore, de novo sequencing algorithms are\ndeveloped to overcome the problem by directly reconstructing the peptide\nsequence of an MS/MS spectrum without using any protein database. Current de\nnovo sequencing algorithms often fail to construct the completely matched\nsequences, and produce partial matches. In this study, we propose a genetic\nalgorithm based method, GA-Novo, to solve the complex optimisation task of de\nnovo peptide sequencing, aiming at constructing full length sequences. Given an\nMS/MS spectrum, GA-Novo optimises the amino acid sequences to best fit the\ninput spectrum. On the testing dataset, GA-Novo outperforms PEAKS, the most\ncommonly used software for this task, by constructing 8% higher number of fully\nmatched peptide sequences, and 4% higher recall at partially matched sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Feb 2019 04:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

Manual selection of\nthe method sensitivity (tau*) and threshold (eT) are necessary for effective\ndiscrimination between burst periods and the background turbulent flow\nfluctuations (burst-free periods). The flow characteristic used for\nidentification is the normalized 'instantaneous' TKE dissipation rate levels,\ncalculated using sliding window averaging. Use of the record root mean square\nand average values for normalization eliminates the need for definition of a\nphysics-based flow-specific threshold. Instead, the suitable sensitivity range\nand the threshold parameters are selected based on preliminary examination of\nthe velocity records. This, potentially, makes the method applicable for use\nacross various flow fields, especially as it does not require resolving the\nburst-generation mechanism. The method performance is examined using a field\nobtained dataset of buoyancy driven turbulent boundary layer flow. Here, the\nselection of a two-fold (eT=2) increase is used and the sensitivity of the\nmethod is examined. Spectral shapes of non-bursting periods show distinguished\nsimilarity to those of the Kolmogorov theory, while the bursting period\nspectral shapes vary significantly. Low resolution records of temperature\nfluctuations were observed to exhibit a significant decrease in temperature\n(scalar) dissipation rate during bursting periods. Based on this observation\nand additional processing, a statistical examination of temperature (scalar)\ndissipation rate is presented along with a normalization procedure. Future\nexamination of additional scalar variations, i.e. particulate matter and/or\ngaseous pollutant concentrations, in connection with turbulent bursting periods\ncan assist in further understanding of bursting generation and scalar transfer\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Feb 2019 10:45:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2019 15:07:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 11:12:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 20:15:11 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 17:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Currently, PKIs are under the\ncontrol of centralized authorities, which is problematic as evidenced by\nnumerous incidents where they have been compromised. The distributed, fault\ntolerant log of transactions provided by blockchains and more recently, smart\ncontract platforms, constitutes a powerful tool for the decentralization of\nPKIs. To verify the validity of identity records, blockchain-based identity\nsystems store on chain either all identity records, or, a small (or even\nconstant) sized amount of data to verify identity records stored off chain.\nHowever, as most of these systems have never been implemented, there is little\ninformation regarding the practical implications of each design's tradeoffs.\n  In this work, we first implement and evaluate the only provably secure, smart\ncontract based PKI of [1] on top of Ethereum. This construction incurs\nconstant-sized storage at the expense of computational complexity. To explore\nthis tradeoff, we propose and implement a second construction which, eliminates\nthe need for trusted setup, preserves the security properties of [1] and, as\nillustrated through our evaluation, is the only version with constant-sized\nstate that can be deployed on the live chain of Ethereum. Furthermore, we\ncompare these two systems with the simple approach of most prior works, e.g.,\nthe Ethereum Name Service, where all identity records are stored on the smart\ncontract's state, to illustrate several shortcomings of Ethereum and its cost\nmodel. We propose several modifications for fine tuning the model, which would\nbe useful to be considered for any smart contract platform like Ethereum so\nthat it reaches its full potential to support arbitrary distributed\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Feb 2019 10:59:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-05"}

This simplicity stems from the\ninherent utility of employing the state of smart contracts to store, query and\nverify the validity of application data. In Ethereum, data storage incurs an\nunderpriced, non-recurring, predefined fee. Furthermore, as there is no\nincentive for freeing or minimizing the state of smart contracts, Ethereum is\nfaced with a tragedy of the commons problem with regards to its monotonically\nincreasing state. This issue, if left unchecked, may lead to centralization and\ndirectly impact Ethereum's security and longevity. In this work, we introduce\nan alternative paradigm for developing smart contracts in which their state is\nof constant size and facilitates the verification of application data that are\nstored to and queried from an external, potentially unreliable, storage\nnetwork. This approach is relevant for a wide range of applications, such as\nany key-value store. We evaluate our approach by adapting the most widely\ndeployed standard for fungible tokens, i.e., the ERC20 token standard. We show\nthat Ethereum's current cost model penalizes our approach, even though it\nminimizes the overhead to Ethereum's state and aligns well with Ethereum's\nfuture. We address Ethereum's monotonically increasing state in a two-fold\nmanner. First, we introduce recurring fees that are proportional to the state\nof smart contracts and adjustable by the miners that maintain the network.\nSecond, we propose a scheme where the cost of storage-related operations\nreflects the effort that miners have to expend to execute them. Lastly, we show\nthat under such a pricing scheme that encourages economy in the state consumed\nby smart contracts, our ERC20 token adaptation reduces the incurred transaction\nfees by up to an order of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Feb 2019 11:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-05"}

Firstly, we consider the case in which the players'\ndynamics are subject to bounded disturbances only.

This has led to three proposed contributions in this thesis. The\nfirst approach takes advantage of the emergence of Web 2.0 and, therefore,\nsocial networks using minimal transversal for the detection of important actors\nwithin these networks. The second part of research in this thesis has focused\non reducing the number of hypergraph minimal transversal. A concise and\naccurate representation of minimal transversal was proposed and is based on the\nconstruction of an irredundant hypergraph, hence are calculated the irredundant\nminimal transversal of the initial hypergraph. An application of this\nrepresentation to the dependency inference problem is presented to illustrate\nthe usefulness of this approach.

But success is\nsubject to complexity, uncertainty, and change - and at times becoming\nincreasingly unequally distributed. This leads to tension and confusion over to\nwhat extent people actually get what they deserve (i.e., fairness/meritocracy).\nMoreover, in many fields, humans are over-confident and pervasively confuse\nluck for skill (I win, it's skill; I lose, it's bad luck). In some fields,\nthere is too much risk taking; in others, not enough. Where success derives in\nlarge part from luck - and especially where bailouts skew the incentives\n(heads, I win; tails, you lose) - it follows that luck is rewarded too much.\nThis incentivizes a culture of gambling, while downplaying the importance of\nproductive effort. And, short term success is often rewarded, irrespective, and\npotentially at the detriment, of the long-term system fitness. However, much\nsuccess is truly meritocratic, and the problem is to discern and reward based\non merit. We call this the fair reward problem. To address this, we propose\nthree different measures to assess merit: (i) raw outcome; (ii) risk adjusted\noutcome, and (iii) prospective. We emphasize the need, in many cases, for the\ndeductive prospective approach, which considers the potential of a system to\nadapt and mutate in novel futures. This is formalized within an evolutionary\nsystem, comprised of five processes, inter alia handling the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off.

The approximate solver provides the\ninterface stress and normal velocity by an iterative method.

The proposed solver is applied in computing the numerical flux at the\nphase interface for our compressible multi-medium flow simulation on Eulerian\ngirds.

Due to limited evacuation resource, i.e., number of available exits,\nthere exists interdependence among pedestrians such as cooperation, competition\nand herd effect. Thus human factors - more specifically, pedestrians' behavior\nin emergency evacuation - play a significant role in evacuation research.\nEffective evacuation can only be reached when route planning are considered in\nconjunction with psychological dynamics, which is often ignored. As another\ndrawback, previous research assumes the environment including available exits\nas stationary. However, we note that during emergency, some exits which are not\noften utilized in normal times are opened, which potentially helps if\npedestrians are aware of them. In this paper, we analyze the effect of\npedestrians' behavior, i.e., herd effect and knowledge of changing environment\nwith Cellular Automata (CA) simulation. Results of the simulation show the\nharmful effect of herd effect as well as highlight the importance of timely\ninforming pedestrians of environmental change. Accordingly, we propose policy\nand procedural recommendations for emergency management of large, crowded\nstructures. Our future work includes considering more human factors and\napplying our model to log data provided by videos in public venues, which can\nfurther show effectiveness of our model in real scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Feb 2019 10:49:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 03:24:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 05:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}
