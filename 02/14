Thus, developing techniques for transfer learning, in its broadest\ndefinition, is a crucial element towards the deployment of effective and\naccurate intelligent systems. This thesis will focus on a family of transfer\nlearning methods applied to the task of visual object recognition, specifically\nimage classification. Transfer learning is a general term, and specific\nsettings have been given specific names: when the learner has only access to\nunlabeled data from the a target domain and labeled data from a different\ndomain (the source), the problem is known as that of \"unsupervised domain\nadaptation\" (DA).

The second part will focus on the real life issues of\nrobotic perception, specifically RGB-D recognition. Robotic platforms are\nusually not limited to color perception; very often they also carry a Depth\ncamera. Unfortunately, the depth modality is rarely used for visual recognition\ndue to the lack of pretrained models from which to transfer and little data to\ntrain one on from scratch. Two methods for dealing with this scenario will be\npresented: one using synthetic data and the other exploiting cross-modality\ntransfer learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 16:32:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-14"}

The momentum and heat fluxes as well as the cooling rate\nare obtained to first order in the deviations of the hydrodynamic field\ngradients from their values in the homogeneous steady state. Since the cooling\nterms (arising from collisional dissipation and viscous friction) cannot be\ncompensated for by the energy gained by grains due to collisions with the\ninterstitial gas, the reference distribution (zeroth-order approximation of the\nChapman--Enskog solution) depends on time through its dependence on\ntemperature.

This\nsimplification allows us to get explicit expressions for the Navier--Stokes\ntransport coefficients.

To understand these processes and place them in the context of a\nsolar wind plasma interacting with a neutral atmosphere, numerical or\nanalytical models are necessary. Inputs of these models, such as collision\ncross sections and chemistry, are crucial.\n  Book-keeping and fitting of experimentally measured charge-changing and\nionization cross sections of hydrogen and helium particles in a water gas are\ndiscussed, with emphasis on the low-energy/low-velocity range that is\ncharacteristic of solar wind bulk speeds ($< 20$ keV u$^{-1}$/$2000$ km\ns$^{-1}$).\n  We provide polynomial fits for cross sections of charge-changing and\nionization reactions, and list the experimental needs for future studies. We\ncalculated Maxwellian-averaged cross sections and fitted them with bivariate\npolynomials for solar wind temperatures ranging from $10^5$ to $10^6$ K\n($12-130$ eV). Single- and double-electron captures by He$^{2+}$ dominate at\ntypical solar wind speeds. Correspondingly, single-electron capture by H$^+$\nand single-electron loss by H$^-$ dominate at these speeds, resulting in the\nproduction of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs). Ionization cross sections all\npeak at energies above $20$ keV and are expected to play a moderate role in the\ntotal ion production. The effect of solar wind Maxwellian temperatures is found\nto be maximum for cross sections peaking at higher energies, suggesting that\nlocal heating at shock structures in cometary and planetary environments may\nfavor processes previously thought to be negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 18:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Numerical simulations of the nonlinear transitional regime in a\nBlasius boundary layer are performed where streaks are excited in the boundary\nlayer via a high level of free-stream turbulence (FST). The occurring\ndisturbances are measured via localized wall sensors and damped via near-wall\nactuators resembling plasma actuators. The time-varying amplitude of the signal\nof each actuator is computed by processing signals from the sensors. This\nprocessing is the result of two control laws: the Linear Quadratic Gaussian\nregulator (LQG) and the Inverse Feed-Forward Control technique (IFFC). The use\nof the first, LQG, requires a state-space representation of the system\ndynamics, so the flow is described via an operator that captures only the most\nrelevant information of the dynamics and results in a reduced order model\n(ROM). The ROM is computed via the eigensystem realization algorithm, based on\nthe impulse responses of the real system. Collecting such impulse responses may\nbe unfeasible when considering FST because of the high dimensionality of the\ninput forcing needed for a precise description of such a phenomenon. Here, a\nnew method to identify the relevant system dynamics and generate the needed\nimpulse responses is proposed, in a data-driven approach that would be\nrealizable in experiments. Finally, the effectiveness of the technique in\ndelaying bypass transition is shown. The work (i) presents a systematic way to\ndeal with high dimensional disturbances to build ROMs for a control technique,\nand (ii) shows that even when considering constraints such as the type and size\nof actuators and sensors, it is possible to achieve at least as large delay of\nbypass transition as that obtained in more idealized cases found in literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 18:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

In this work,\nwe revisit this idea and consider a model where $A^{\\prime}$ couples\ninelastically to dark matter and an excited dark sector state, leading to a\nmore exotic decay topology we refer to as a semi-visible decay. We show that\nfor large mass splittings between the dark sector states this decay mode is\nenhanced, weakening the previous invisibly decaying dark photon bounds. As a\nconsequence, $A^{\\prime}$ resolves the $g_{\\mu} - 2$ anomaly in a region of\nparameter space the thermal dark matter component of the Universe is readily\nexplained. Interestingly, it is possible that the semi-visible events we\ndiscuss may have been vetoed by experiments searching for invisible dark photon\ndecays. A re-analysis of the data and future searches may be crucial in\nuncovering this exotic decay mode or closing the window on the dark photon\nexplanation of the $g_{\\mu} - 2$ anomaly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 19:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 19:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}

EMS BH scalarisation presents a\ntechnical simplification over the BH scalarisation that has been conjectured to\noccur in extended Scalar-Tensor Gauss-Bonnet (eSTGB) models. It is then natural\nto ask: 1) how universal are the conclusions extracted from the EMS model? And\n2) how much do these conclusions depend on the choice of the non-minimal\ncoupling function? Here we perform a comparative analysis of different forms\nfor the coupling function including: exponential, hyperbolic, power-law and a\nrational function (fraction) couplings. In all of them we obtain and study the\ndomain of existence of fundamental, spherically symmetric, scalarised BHs and\ncompute, in particular, their entropy. The latter shows that scalarised EMS BHs\nare always entropically preferred over the RN BHs with the same total charge to\nmass ratio $q$. This contrasts with the case of eSTGB, where for the same\npower-law coupling the spherical, fundamental scalarised BHs are not\nentropically preferred over Schwarzschild. Also, while the scalarised solutions\nin the EMS model for the exponential, hyperbolic and power-law coupling are\nvery similar, the rational function coupling leads to a transition in the\ndomain of existence. Furthermore, fully non-linear dynamical evolutions of\nunstable RN BHs with different values of $q$ are presented. These show: 1) for\nsufficiently small $q$, scalarised solutions with (approximately) the same $q$\nform dynamically; 2) for large $q$, spontaneous scalarisation visibly decreases\n$q$; thus evolutions are non-conservative; 3) despite the existence of\nnon-spherical, static scalarised solutions, the evolution of unstable RN BHs\nunder non-spherical perturbations leads to a spherical scalarised BH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 19:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 15:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Comm. 228, 229-244 (2018)] which dealt\nwith quantum dynamics of closed and open systems, respectively, the present\nPart III adds fully classical and mixed quantum-classical propagations to\nWavePacket. In those simulations classical phase-space densities are sampled by\ntrajectories which follow (diabatic or adiabatic) potential energy surfaces. In\nthe vicinity of (genuine or avoided) intersections of those surfaces\ntrajectories may switch between surfaces. To model these transitions, two\nclasses of stochastic algorithms have been implemented: (1) J. C. Tully's\nfewest switches surface hopping and (2) Landau-Zener based single switch\nsurface hopping. The latter one offers the advantage of being based on\nadiabatic energy gaps only, thus not requiring non-adiabatic coupling\ninformation any more.\n  The present work describes the MATLAB version of WavePacket 6.0.2 which is\nessentially an object-oriented rewrite of previous versions, allowing to\nperform fully classical, quantum-classical and quantum-mechanical simulations\non an equal footing, i.e., for the same physical system described by the same\nWavePacket input.

We present three challenges to a naive reading of\npilot-wave theory, each based on a system of several entangled particles. With\nthe help of a coarse graining of pilot wave theory into a discrete system, we\nshow how these challenges can be answered. However this comes with a cost. In\nthe description of individual systems, particles appear to scatter off empty\nbranches of the wave function as if they were particles, and conversely travel\nthrough particles as if they were waves. More generally, the \"particles\" of\npilot wave theory are led by the guidance equation to move in ways no classical\nparticle would, involving apparent violations of the principles of inertia and\nmomentum conservation.We next argue that the aforementioned cost can be avoided\nwithin a retrocausal model.

If the out-of-virtual-machine\nsecurity tools want to monitor some kernel objects, they need to intercept the\noperation of the whole memory page. Since there are some other objects stored\nin the monitored pages, the modification of them will also trigger the monitor.\nTherefore, page-level memory monitor usually introduces overhead to related\nkernel services of the target virtual machine. In this paper, we propose a\nlow-overhead kernel object monitoring approach to reduce the overhead caused by\npage-level monitor. The core idea is to migrate the target kernel objects to a\nprotected memory area and then to monitor the corresponding new memory pages.\nSince the new pages only contain the kernel objects to be monitored, other\nkernel objects will not trigger our monitor. Therefore, our monitor will not\nintroduce runtime overhead to the related kernel service. The experimental\nresults show that our system can monitor target kernel objects effectively only\nwith very low overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 21:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-15"}

It was previously shown that, for even $D$,\nsimilar to the original Kuramoto model ($D=2$), there exists a continuous\ndynamical phase transition from incoherence to coherence of the time asymptotic\nattracting state as the coupling parameter $K$ increases through a critical\nvalue $K_c^{(+)}>0$. We consider this transition from the point of view of the\nstability of an incoherent state, i.e., where the $N\\to\\infty$ distribution\nfunction is time-independent and the macroscopic order parameter is zero. In\ncontrast with $D=2$, for even $D>2$ there is an infinity of possible incoherent\nequilibria, each of which becomes unstable with increasing $K$ at a different\npoint $K=K_c$. We show that there are incoherent equilibria for all $K_c$\nwithin the range $(K_c^{(+)}/2)\\leq K_c \\leq K_c^{(+)}$. How can the possible\ninstability of incoherent states arising at $K=K_c<K_c^{(+)}$ be reconciled\nwith the previous finding that, at large time, the state is always incoherent\nunless $K>K_c^{(+)}$? We find, for a given incoherent equilibrium, that, if $K$\nis rapidly increased from $K<K_c$ to $K_c<K<K_c^{(+)}$, due to the instability,\na short, macroscopic burst of coherence is observed, which initially grows\nexponentially, but then reaches a maximum, past which it decays back into\nincoherence. After this decay, we observe that the equilibrium has been reset\nto one whose $K_c$ value exceeds that of the increased $K$. Thus this process,\nwhich we call `Instability-Mediated Resetting,' leads to an increase in the\neffective $K_c$ with continuously increasing $K$, until the equilibrium has\nbeen effectively set to one for which for which $K_c\\approx K_c^{(+)}$, leading\nto a unique critical point of the time asymptotic state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 23:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

We first show that there is the similarity between\nthe dynamics of memristors and neurons. That is, some kind of flux-controlled\nmemristors can not respond to the sinusoidal voltage source quickly, namely,\nthey can not switch `on' rapidly. Furthermore, these memristors have refractory\nperiod after switch `on', which means that it can not respond to further\nsinusoidal inputs until the flux is decreased. We next show that the\nmemristor-coupled two-cell CNN can exhibit chaotic behavior. In this system,\nthe memristors switch `off' and `on' at irregular intervals, and the two cells\nare connected when either or both of the memristors switches `on'. We then\npropose the modified CNN model, which can hold a binary output image, even if\nall cells are disconnected and no signal is supplied to the cell after a\ncertain point of time. However, the modified CNN requires power to maintain the\noutput image, that is, it is volatile. We next propose a new memristor CNN\nmodel. It can also hold a binary output state (image), even if all cells are\ndisconnected, and no signal is supplied to the cell, by memristor's switching\nbehavior. Furthermore, even if we turn off the power of the system during the\ncomputation, it can resume from the previous average output state, since the\nmemristor CNN has functions of both short-term (volatile) memory and long-term\n(non-volatile) memory. The above suspend and resume feature are useful when we\nwant to save the current state, and continue work later from the previous\nstate. Finally, we show that the memristor CNN can exhibit interesting\ntwo-dimensional waves, if an inductor is connected to each memristor CNN cell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 00:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-15"}

This\nformulation yields a policy generation framework for multi-robot systems that\ncan combine controllers for a variety of objectives while implicitly handling\nthe interaction among robots and subtasks.

The SBSs will collect\ntracking data from the VR users, over the uplink, in order to generate the VR\ncontent and transmit it to the end-users using downlink cellular links. For\nthis model, the data requested or transmitted by the users can exhibit\ncorrelation, since the VR users may engage in the same immersive virtual\nenvironment with different locations and orientations. As such, the proposed\nresource management framework can factor in such spatial data correlation, to\nbetter manage uplink and downlink traffic. This potential spatial data\ncorrelation can be factored into the resource allocation problem to reduce the\ntraffic load in both uplink and downlink. In the downlink, the cloud can\ntransmit 360 contents or specific visible contents that are extracted from the\noriginal 360 contents to the users according to the users' data correlation to\nreduce the backhaul traffic load. For uplink, each SBS can associate with the\nusers that have similar tracking information so as to reduce the tracking data\nsize. This data correlation-aware resource management problem is formulated as\nan optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users' successful\ntransmission probability, defined as the probability that the content\ntransmission delay of each user satisfies an instantaneous VR delay target. To\nsolve this problem, an echo state networks (ESNs) based transfer learning is\nintroduced. By smartly transferring information on the SBS's utility, the\nproposed transfer-based ESN algorithm can quickly cope with changes in the\nwireless networking environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 01:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-15"}

However, spectroscopic data will be available for only a small\nfraction of these sources, and in most cases even the optical and infrared\nphotometry will be of limited quality. Furthermore, radio sources tend to be at\nhigher redshift than most optical sources and so a significant fraction of\nradio sources hosts differ from those for which most photometric redshift\ntemplates are designed. We therefore need to develop new techniques for\nestimating the redshifts of radio sources. As a starting point in this process,\nwe evaluate a number of machine-learning techniques for estimating redshift,\ntogether with a conventional template-fitting technique. We pay special\nattention to how the performance is affected by the incompleteness of the\ntraining sample and by sparseness of the parameter space or by limited\navailability of ancillary multi-wavelength data. As expected, we find that the\nquality of the photometric-redshift degrades as the quality of the photometry\ndecreases, but that even with the limited quality of photometry available for\nall sky-surveys, useful redshift information is available for the majority of\nsources, particularly at low redshift. We find that a template-fitting\ntechnique performs best with high-quality and almost complete multi-band\nphotometry, especially if radio sources that are also X-ray emitting are\ntreated separately. When we reduced the quality of photometry to match that\navailable for the EMU all-sky radio survey, the quality of the template-fitting\ndegraded and became comparable to some of the machine learning methods. Machine\nlearning techniques currently perform better at low redshift than at high\nredshift, because of incompleteness of the currently available training data at\nhigh redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 02:07:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

This poses an insurmountable\nchallenge to response surface modeling since the number of forward model\nevaluations needed to construct an accurate surrogate grows exponentially with\nthe dimension of the uncertain parameter space; a phenomenon referred to as the\n\\textit{curse of dimensionality}. State-of-the-art methods for high-dimensional\nuncertainty propagation seek to alleviate the curse of dimensionality by\nperforming dimensionality reduction in the uncertain parameter space.

Formal\nverification provides ways of establishing correctness guarantees, which can be\nquite important for such safety-critical applications. But since PLC code does\nnot include an analytic model of the system plant, their verification is\nlimited to discrete properties. In this paper, we, thus, start the other way\naround with hybrid programs that include continuous plant models in addition to\ndiscrete control algorithms. Even deep correctness properties of hybrid\nprograms can be formally verified in the theorem prover KeYmaera X that\nimplements differential dynamic logic, dL, for hybrid programs. After verifying\nthe hybrid program, we now present an approach for translating hybrid programs\ninto PLC code. The new tool, HyPLC, implements this translation of discrete\ncontrol code of verified hybrid program models to PLC controller code and, vice\nversa, the translation of existing PLC code into the discrete control actions\nfor a hybrid program given an additional input of the continuous dynamics of\nthe system to be verified. This approach allows for the generation of real\ncontroller code while preserving, by compilation, the correctness of a valid\nand verified hybrid program. PLCs are common cyber-physical interfaces for\nsafety-critical industrial control applications, and HyPLC serves as a\npragmatic tool for bridging formal verification of complex cyber-physical\nsystems at the algorithmic level of hybrid programs with the execution layer of\nconcrete PLC implementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 03:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-15"}

Scalaron linearly\ncouples to matter via the trace of energy-momentum tensor. We study scenarios\nwith a sequestered matter sector, where the trace of energy-momentum tensor\npredominantly determines the scalaron coupling to matter. In a sequestered\nsetup, heavy degrees of freedom are expected to decouple from low-energy\ndynamics. On the other hand, it is non-trivial to see the decoupling since\nscalaron couples to a mass term of heavy degrees of freedom. Actually, when\nheavy degrees of freedom carry some gauge charge, the amplitude of scalaron\ndecay to two gauge bosons does not vanish in the heavy mass limit. Here the\nquantum contribution to the trace of energy-momentum tensor plays an essential\nrole. This quantum contribution is known as trace anomaly or Weyl anomaly. The\ntrace anomaly contribution from heavy degrees of freedom cancels with the\ncontribution from the ${\\it classical}$ scalaron coupling to a mass term of\nheavy degrees of freedom.

While previous studies have only considered spherical\nhaze particles, photochemical hazes composed of hydrocarbon aggregate particles\nare common throughout the solar system. We use an aerosol microphysics model to\ninvestigate the effect of aggregate photochemical haze particles on\ntransmission spectra of warm exoplanets. We find that the wavelength dependence\nof the optical depth of aggregate particle hazes is flatter than for spheres\nsince aggregates grow to larger radii. As a result, while spherical haze\nopacity displays a scattering slope towards shorter wavelengths, aggregate haze\nopacity can be gray in the optical and NIR, similar to those assumed for\ncondensate cloud decks. We further find that haze opacity increases with\nincreasing production rate, decreasing eddy diffusivity, and increasing monomer\nsize, though the magnitude of the latter effect is dependent on production rate\nand the atmospheric pressure levels probed. We generate synthetic exoplanet\ntransmission spectra to investigate the effect of these hazes on spectral\nfeatures. For high haze opacity cases, aggregate hazes lead to flat, nearly\nfeatureless spectra, while spherical hazes produce sloped spectra with clear\nspectral features at long wavelengths. Finally, we generate synthetic\ntransmission spectra of GJ 1214b for aggregate and spherical hazes and compare\nthem to space-based observations. We find that aggregate hazes can reproduce\nthe data significantly better than spherical hazes, assuming a production rate\nlimited by delivery of methane to the upper atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 06:11:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

The orientation of the active\nparticle is governed by a stochastic dynamics, with the orientational\npersistence time determined by the rotational diffusivity. To hydrodynamically\ndrive the active particle as a pusher, a pair of active forces are exerted on\nthe head particle and the phantom fluid region respectively.

Compared to single-phase flow, we\nfind that the resulting steady state conditions exhibit reduced Taylor\nmicroscale Reynolds numbers owing to the presence of the dispersed phase, which\nacts as a sink of turbulent kinetic energy for the carrier fluid. At steady\nstate, the mean power of surface tension is zero and the turbulent production\nrate is in balance with the turbulent dissipation rate, with their values being\nlarger than in the reference single-phase case. The interface modifies the\nenergy spectrum by introducing energy at small-scales, with the difference from\nthe single-phase case reducing as the Weber number increases. This is caused by\nboth the number of droplets in the domain and the total surface area increasing\nmonotonically with the Weber number. This reflects also in the droplets size\ndistribution which changes with the Weber number, with the peak of the\ndistribution moving to smaller sizes as the Weber number increases. We show\nthat the Hinze estimate for the maximum droplet size, obtained considering\nbreakup in homogeneous isotropic turbulence, provides an excellent estimate\nnotwithstanding the action of significant coalescence and the presence of a\nmean shear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 08:36:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 13:19:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

Participants directly make payments through a network\nof payment channels without the overhead of committing onchain transactions.\nRouting is critical to the performance of offchain networks. Existing solutions\nuse either static routing with poor performance or dynamic routing with high\noverhead to obtain the dynamic channel balance information. In this paper, we\npropose Flash, a new dynamic routing solution that leverages the unique\ncharacteristics of transactions in offchain networks to strike a better\ntradeoff between path optimality and probing overhead. By studying the traces\nof real offchain networks, we find that the payment sizes are heavy-tailed, and\nmost payments are highly recurrent. Flash thus differentiates the treatment of\nelephant payments from mice payments. It uses a modified max-flow algorithm for\nelephant payments to find paths with sufficient capacity, and strategically\nroutes the payment across paths to minimize the transaction fees. Mice payments\nare directly sent by looking up a routing table with a few precomputed paths to\nreduce probing overhead. Testbed experiments and data-driven simulations show\nthat Flash improves the success volume of payments by up to 2.3x compared to\nthe state-of-the-art routing algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 08:36:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 03:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

Using [Fe/MgO]$_n$ as a\nmodel system, we perform ultraviolet pump/soft X-ray probe experiments, which\nare sensitive to all constituents of these heterostructures, to probe both\nelectronic and lattice excitations. Complementary ultrafast electron\ndiffraction experiments independently analyze the lattice dynamics of the Fe\nconstituent, and together with ab initio calculations yield comprehensive\ninsight into the microscopic processes leading to local relaxation within a\nsingle constituent or non-local relaxation between two constituents. Besides\nelectronic excitations in Fe, which are monitored at the Fe L$_3$ absorption\nedge and relax within 1 ps by electron-phonon coupling, soft X-ray analysis\nidentifies a change at the oxygen K absorption edge of the MgO layers which\noccurs within 0.5 ps. This ultrafast energy transfer across the Fe-MgO\ninterface is mediated by high-frequency, interface vibrational modes, which are\nexcited by hot electrons in Fe and couple to vibrations in MgO in a\nmode-selective, non-thermal manner. A second, slower timescale is identified at\nthe oxygen K pre-edge and the Fe L$_3$ edge. The slower process represents\nenergy transfer by acoustic phonons and contributes to thermalization of the\nentire heterostructure. We thus find that the interfacial energy transfer is\nassociated with non-equilibrium behavior in the phonon system. Because our\nexperiments lack signatures of charge transfer across the interface, we\nconclude that phonon-mediated processes dominate the competition of electronic\nand lattice excitations in these non-local, non-equilibrium dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 08:54:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 2019 16:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

Here we explore and interpret the\ncorrelations in the $(v_R, v_z)$-velocity distribution as a function of\nposition in the Milky Way. We selected a high-quality sample of stars from the\nGaia DR2 catalogue and characterised the orientation of the velocity\ndistribution or tilt angle over a radial distance range of $[4-13]~$kpc and up\nto $3.5~$kpc away from the Galactic plane while taking into account the effects\nof the measurement errors. We find that the tilt angles change from spherical\nalignment in the inner Galaxy ($R\\sim4~$kpc) towards more cylindrical\nalignments in the outer Galaxy ($R\\sim11~$kpc) when using distances that take a\nglobal zero-point offset in the parallax of $-29~\\mu$as. However, if the\namplitude of this offset is underestimated, then the inferred tilt angles in\nthe outer Galaxy only appear shallower and are intrinsically more consistent\nwith spherical alignment for an offset as large as $-54~\\mu$as. We further find\nthat the tilt angles do not seem to strongly vary with Galactic azimuth and\nthat different stellar populations depict similar tilt angles. Therefore we\nintroduce a simple analytic function that describes the trends found over the\nfull radial range. Since the systematic parallax errors in Gaia DR2 depend on\ncelestial position, magnitude, and colour in complex ways, it is not possible\nto fully correct for them. Therefore it will be particularly important for\ndynamical modelling of the Milky Way to thoroughly characterise the systematics\nin astrometry in future Gaia data releases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 09:01:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 13:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

While previous\nstudies provide a visual classification of a patched area, we used the public\ncode called galaxy Support Vector Machine (galSVM) and HST/ACS data as well as\nWFP2 master catalogue to automatically classify all cluster members up to 1\nMpc. galSVM analyses galaxy morphologies through Support Vector Machine (SVM).\nFrom the 231 cluster galaxies, we classified 97 as early-types (ET) and 83 as\nlate-types (LT). The remaining 51 stayed unclassified (or undecided, UD). By\ncross-matching our results with the existing visual classification, we found an\nagreement of 81%. In addition to previous Zwcl0024 morphological\nclassifications, 121 of our galaxies were classified for the first time in this\nwork. In addition, we tested the location of classified galaxies on the\nstandard morphological diagrams, colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams.\nOut of all cluster members, $\\sim$20% are emission line galaxies (ELG), taking\ninto account previous GLACE results. We have verified that the ET fraction is\nslightly higher near the cluster core and decreases with the clustercentric\ndistance, while the opposite trend has been observed for LT galaxies. We found\nhigher fraction of ET (54%) than LT (46%) throughout the analysed central\nregion, as expected. In addition, we analysed the correlation between the five\nmorphological parameters (Abraham concentration, Bershady-Concelice\nconcentration, Asymmetry, Gini and M20 moment of light) and clustercentric\ndistance, without finding a clear trend. Finally, as a result of our work, the\nmorphological catalogue of 231 galaxies containing all the measured parameters\nand the final classification is available in the electronic form of this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 09:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-15"}

In particular, its anisotropy (easy basal\nslip) has been suspected for a long time, then fully characterized 40 years\nago. More recently emerged the interest of ice as a model material to study\nsome fundamental aspects of crystalline plasticity. An example is the nature of\nplastic fluctuations and collective dislocation dynamics. 20 years ago,\nacoustic emission measurements performed during the deformation of ice single\ncrystals revealed that plastic flow proceeds through intermittent dislocation\navalanches, power law distributed in size and energy. This means that most of\nice plasticity takes place through few, very large avalanches, thus qualifying\nassociated plastic fluctuations as wild. This launched an intense research\nactivity on plastic intermittency in the Material Science community. The\ninterest of ice in this debate is reviewed, from a comparison with other\ncrystalline materials. In this context, ice appears as an extreme case of\nplastic intermittency, characterized by scale-free fluctuations, complex space\nand time correlations as well as avalanche triggering. In other words, ice can\nbe considered as the paradigm of wild plasticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 09:32:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-15"}

There are two main distinct classes of\nsolar cycle prediction methods: the precursor-like ones and the\nmathematical-numerical ones. The main characteristic of precursor techniques,\nboth purely solar and geomagnetic, is their physical basis. Conversely, the\nnon-precursor methods use different mathematical and/or numerical properties of\nthe known temporal evolution of solar activity indices to extract useful\ninformation for predicting future activity. For current solar cycle #24 we\nobtained fairly good statistical performances from both precursor and purely\nnumerical methods, such as the so-called solar precursor and nonlinear ones. To\nfurther check the performances of these prediction techniques, we compared the\nearly predictions for the next solar cycle #25.

Importantly, their functionality depends on the emerging\ncollective dynamics of the network. Synchrony of oscillations is one of the\nmost prominent examples of such collective behavior and has been associated\nboth with function and dysfunction. Understanding how network structure and\ninteractions, as well as the microscopic properties of individual units, shape\nthe emerging collective dynamics is critical to find factors that lead to\nmalfunction. However, many biological systems such as the brain consist of a\nlarge number of dynamical units. Hence, their analysis has either relied on\nsimplified heuristic models on a coarse scale, or the analysis comes at a huge\ncomputational cost. Here we review recently introduced approaches, known as the\nOtt-Antonsen and Watanabe-Strogatz reductions, allowing one to simplify the\nanalysis by bridging small and large scales. Thus, reduced model equations are\nobtained that exactly describe the collective dynamics for each subpopulation\nin the oscillator network via few collective variables only. The resulting\nequations are next-generation models: Rather than being heuristic, they exactly\nlink microscopic and macroscopic descriptions and therefore accurately capture\nmicroscopic properties of the underlying system. At the same time, they are\nsufficiently simple to analyze without great computational effort. In the last\ndecade, these reduction methods have become instrumental in understanding how\nnetwork structure and interactions shape the collective dynamics and the\nemergence of synchrony.

However, in this paper, we propose a novel saliency-channel\nattention residual network based on the just-noticeable-difference (JND)\nconcept for full-reference image quality assessments (FR-IQA). It is referred\nto as JND-SalCAR and shows significant improvements in large IQA datasets with\nvarious types of distortion. The proposed JND-SalCAR effectively learns how to\nincorporate human psychophysical characteristics, such as visual saliency and\nJND, into image quality predictions. In the proposed network, a SalCAR block is\ndevised so that perceptually important features can be extracted with the help\nof saliency-based spatial attention and channel attention schemes. In addition,\na saliency map serves as a guideline for predicting a patch weight map in order\nto afford stable training of end-to-end optimization for the JND-SalCAR. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our work presents the first HVS-inspired trainable\nFR-IQA network that considers both visual saliency and the JND characteristics\nof the HVS. When the visual saliency map and the JND probability map are\nexplicitly given as priors, they can be usefully combined to predict IQA scores\nrated by humans more precisely, eventually leading to performance improvements\nand faster convergence. The experimental results show that the proposed\nJND-SalCAR significantly outperforms all recent state-of-the-art FR-IQA methods\non large IQA datasets in terms of the Spearman rank order coefficient (SRCC)\nand the Pearson linear correlation coefficient (PLCC).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 11:50:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 12:51:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 08:08:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 06:34:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-19"}

The\nyoung massive cluster Westerlund 1 provides an ideal testbed for understanding\nthis phenomenon, with over 50 cluster members detected in historical X-ray\nobservations. In the decade since these data were obtained, significant new\nmulti-epoch observations of the cluster have been made, allowing a fundamental\nreappraisal of the nature of both X-ray bright and dark stars. A total of 45\nX-ray sources within Wd1 now have precise spectral classifications. These\nobservations identify 16 candidate and confirmed massive binaries; by\ncomparison 22 stars have X-ray properties that imply a contribution from a wind\ncollision zone. X-ray emission appears confined to O9-B0.5 supergiants,\nWolf-Rayets and a small group of highly luminous interacting/post-interaction\nbinaries. Despite their presence in large numbers, no emission is seen from\nearlier, less evolved O stars or later, cooler B super-/hypergiants. We suppose\nthat the lack of X-ray emission from O giants is due to their comparatively low\nbolometric luminosities if, as expected, they follow the canonical L_X/L_bol\nrelation for hot stars. The transition away from X-ray emission for OB\nsupergiants occurs at the location of the bistability jump; we speculate that\nbelow this limit, stellar wind velocities are insufficient for internal, X-ray\nemitting shocks to form. Our results are consistent with recent findings that\nmassive binaries are not uniformly brighter than single stars of comparable\nluminosity and spectral type, although it is noteworthy that the brightest and\nhardest stellar X-ray sources within Wd1 are all either confirmed or candidate\nmassive, interacting/post-interaction binaries (Abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 12:22:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

If a treatment passes through early phase experiments, the\ninvestigators may want to assess it in a late phase randomised controlled\ntrial. An efficient way to do this is adding it as a new research arm to an\nongoing trial. This allows to add the new treatment while the existing arms\ncontinue. The familywise type I error rate (FWER) is often a key quantity of\ninterest in any multi-arm trial. We set out to clarify how it should be\ncalculated when new arms are added to a trial some time after it has started.\n  Methods: We show how the FWER, any-pair and all-pairs powers can be\ncalculated when a new arm is added to a platform trial. We extend the Dunnett\nprobability and derive analytical formulae for the correlation between the test\nstatistics of the existing pairwise comparison and that of the newly added arm.\nWe also verify our analytical derivation via simulations.\n  Results: Our results indicate that the FWER depends on the shared control arm\ninformation (i.e. individuals in continuous and binary outcomes and primary\noutcome events in time-to-event outcomes) from the common control arm patients\nand the allocation ratio. The FWER is driven more by the number of pairwise\ncomparisons and the corresponding (pairwise) Type I error rates than by the\ntiming of the addition of the new arms. The FWER can be estimated using\n\\v{S}id\\'{a}k's correction if the correlation between the test statistics of\npairwise comparisons is less than 0:30.\n  Conclusions: The findings we present in this article can be used to design\ntrials with pre-planned deferred arms or to design new pairwise comparisons\nwithin an ongoing platform trial where control of the pairwise error rate\n(PWER) or FWER (for a subset of pairwise comparisons) is required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 13:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-15"}

The\nmodels in these three different grids all have a current mass of one solar\nmass; effective temperatures of 2600K, 2800K, 3000K, or 3200K; and stellar\nluminosities equal to log(L/Lsun)=3.70, 3.85, or 4.00.\n  The models show that mass loss in carbon stars is facilitated by high\nluminosities, low effective temperatures, and a high carbon excess (C-O) at\nboth solar and subsolar metallicities. Similar combinations of effective\ntemperature, luminosity, and carbon excess produce outflows at both solar and\nsubsolar metallicities. There are no large systematic differences in the\nmass-loss rates and wind velocities produced by these wind models with respect\nto metallicity, nor any systematic difference concerning the distribution of\ngrain sizes or how much carbon is condensed into dust. DARWIN models at\nsubsolar metallicity have approximately 15% lower mass-loss rates compared to\nDARWIN models at solar metallicity with the same stellar parameters and carbon\nexcess. For both solar and subsolar environments typical grain sizes range\nbetween 0.1 and 0.5 micron, the degree of condensed carbon varies between 5%\nand 40%, and the gas-to-dust ratios between 500 and 10000. Furthermore, stellar\nevolution models can use the mass-loss rates calculated from DARWIN models at\nsolar metallicity when modeling the AGB phase at subsolar metallicities if\ncarbon excess is used as the critical abundance parameter instead of the C/O\nratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 13:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

There have been effective schemes such as satisfiability-checking\n(SAT)-based attacks that can potentially decrypt obfuscated circuits, called\ndeobfuscation. Deobfuscation runtime could have a large span ranging from few\nmilliseconds to thousands of years or more, depending on the number and layouts\nof the ICs and camouflaged gates. And hence accurately pre-estimating the\ndeobfuscation runtime is highly crucial for the defenders to maximize it and\noptimize their defense.

Pebbles initially form in the inner\nprotoplanetary disc, sweeping outwards in a radially expanding front,\npotentially forming planetesimals and planetary cores via migration and the\nstreaming instability. This pebble front appears at early times, in what is\ntypically assumed to be a low mass disc. We argue this picture is in conflict\nwith the reality of young circumstellar discs, which are massive and\nself-gravitating. We apply standard pebble accretion and streaming instability\nformulae to self-gravitating protostellar disc models. Fragments will open a\ngap in the pebble disc, but they will likely fail to open a gap in the gas, and\ncontinue rapid inward migration. If this does not strongly perturb the pebble\ndisc, our results show that disc fragments will accrete pebbles efficiently. We\nfind that in general the pebble-to-gas-density ratio fails to exceed 0.01,\nsuggesting that the streaming instability will struggle to operate. It may be\npossible to activate the instability if 10 cm grains are available, and spiral\nstructures can effectively concentrate them in regions of low\ngravito-turbulence. If this occurs, lunar mass cores might be assembled on\ntimescales of a few thousand years, **but this is likely to be rare, and is far\nfrom proven**.

To understand the mechanism of banding experimentally\nobserved we have performed interface resolved simulations of the two-fluid\nsystem. The experiments were perfomed starting with a random distribution of\ndroplets which, under the applied shear, evolves in time resulting in a phase\nseparation.

The formation of massive stars leads to a variety of stellar clusters,\nranging from low stellar density OB associations to dense, gravitationally\nbound starburst clusters. We aimed at identifying the massive stellar content\nand reconstructing the star formation history of the W51 giant molecular cloud.\nWe performed near-infrared imaging and K-band spectroscopy of the massive stars\nin W51. We analyzed the stellar populations using colour-magnitude and\ncolour-colour diagrams and compared the properties of the spectroscopically\nidentified stars with stellar evolution models. We derived the ages of the\ndifferent sub-clusters in W51 and, based on our spectroscopy derived an age for\nW51 of 3 Myrs or less. The age of the P Cygni star LS1 and the presence of two\nstill forming proto-clusters suggests that the star formation history of W51 is\nmore complex than a single burst. We did not find evidence for triggered star\nformation and we concluded that the star formation in W51 is multi seeded. We\nfinally concluded that W51 is a OB association where different sub-clusters\nform over a time span of at least 3-5 Myrs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 15:51:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

Redundant operations\nare a common performance limiter in these code bases. Missed compiler\noptimization opportunities, inappropriate data structure and algorithm choices,\nand developers' inattention to performance are some common reasons for the\nexistence of redundant operations. Developers mainly depend on compilers to\neliminate redundant operations. However, compilers' static analysis often\nmisses optimization opportunities due to ambiguities and limited analysis\nscope; automatic optimizations to algorithmic and data structural problems are\nout of scope.\n  We develop LoadSpy, a whole-program profiler to pinpoint redundant memory\nload operations, which are often a symptom of many redundant operations. The\nstrength of LoadSpy exists in identifying and quantifying redundant load\noperations in programs and associating the redundancies with program execution\ncontexts and scopes to focus developers' attention on problematic code. LoadSpy\nworks on fully optimized binaries, adopts various optimization techniques to\nreduce its overhead, and provides a rich graphic user interface, which make it\na complete developer tool. Applying LoadSpy showed that a large fraction of\nredundant loads is common in modern software packages despite highest levels of\nautomatic compiler optimizations. Guided by LoadSpy, we optimize several\nwell-known benchmarks and real-world applications, yielding significant\nspeedups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 15:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-15"}

These problems include cooperative optimization problems and\nnon-cooperative Nash games. Accordingly, first we consider a multi-agent system\nwhere the agents cooperatively minimize the summation of their local convex\nobjectives, and second, we consider Cartesian stochastic variational inequality\n(CSVI) problems with monotone mappings for addressing stochastic Nash games on\nsemidefinite matrix spaces. Despite the recent advancements in first-order\nmethods addressing problems over vector spaces, there seems to be a major gap\nin the theory of the first-order methods for optimization problems and\nequilibriums on semidefinite matrix spaces. In particular, to the best of our\nknowledge, there exists no method with provable convergence rate for solving\nthe two classes of problems under mild assumptions. Most existing methods\neither rely on strong assumptions, or require a two-loop framework where at\neach iteration a semidefinite optimization problem needs to be solved.\nMotivated by this gap, in the first part of the paper, we develop a mirror\ndescent incremental subgradient method for minimizing a finite-sum function. We\nshow that the iterates generated by the algorithm converge asymptotically to an\noptimal solution and derive a non-asymptotic convergence rate. In the second\npart, we consider semidefinite CSVI problems. We develop a stochastic mirror\ndescent method that only requires monotonicity of the mapping. We show that the\niterates generated by the algorithm converge to a solution of the CSVI almost\nsurely. Using a suitably defined gap function, we derive a convergence rate\nstatement.

Among other medical emergencies,\nsudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the most time-sensitive event that requires the\nquick provision of medical treatment including cardiopulmonary resuscitation\nand electric shocks by automated external defibrillators (AED). An emerging\ntechnology called unmanned aerial vehicles (or drones) is regarded to support\nmountain rescuers in overcoming the time criticality of these emergencies by\nreducing the time span between SCA and early defibrillation.

Putting all those into the\nDisCoCat framework, we can \"compute\" the function of a protein based on the\nfunctions of its domains with the grammar rules that combine them together.\nSince the functions of both the protein and its domains are represented in\nvector spaces, we provide a novel way to formalize the functional\nrepresentation of proteins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 22:06:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 16:54:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 11:44:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

In\nthis paper, we tackle the CPP that simultaneously considers the communication\ndelay, the control plane utilization, and the controller workload distribution.\nDue to this reason, our CPP is intrinsically different from and clearly more\ndifficult than any previously studied CPPs that are NP-hard. To tackle this\nchallenging issue, we develop a new algorithm that seamlessly integrates the\ngenetic algorithm (GA) and the gradient descent (GD) optimization method.\nParticularly, GA is used to search for suitable CPP solutions.

Nature capitalises on the\nphysical attributes of iron biominerals for a variety of functional, structural\nand sensory applications. Although magnetism is an integral property of iron\nbiominerals, the role it plays in their nano-assembly remains a fundamental,\nunanswered question. This is well exemplified by the magnetite-bearing radula\nof chitons. Chitons, a class of marine mollusc, create the hardest biomineral\nof any animal in their abrasion-resistant, self-sharpening teeth4. Despite this\nsystem being subjected to a range of high resolution imaging studies, the\nmechanisms that drive mineral assembly remain unresolved. However, the advent\nof quantum imaging technology provides a new avenue to probe magnetic\nstructures directly. Here we use quantum magnetic microscopy, based on\nnitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond, to attain the first subcellular magnetic\nprofiling of a eukaryotic system. Using complementary magnetic imaging\nprotocols, we spatially map the principal mineral phases (ferrihydrite and\nmagnetite) in the developing teeth of Acanthopleura hirtosa with submicron\nresolution. The images reveal previously undiscovered long-range magnetic\norder, established at the onset of magnetite mineralisation. This is in\ncontrast to electron microscopy studies that show no strong common\ncrystallographic orientation. The quantum-based magnetic profiling techniques\npresented in this work have broad application in biology, earth science,\nchemistry and materials engineering and can be applied across the range of\nsystems for which iron is vital.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 05:42:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 05:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-01"}

Intuitively, if we can learn less discriminative features, and\nthese features still could fit the training data well, the generalization\nability of neural network could be improved. Therefore, we propose a new layer\nwhich is placed between fully connected layers and convolutional layers, called\nas Chanel Max Pooling.
