A Monte-Carlo Particle-in-Cell charged particle transport\npackage for the radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code Chimera was developed for\nthis work. Hotspot power balance between alpha-heating, electron thermal\nconduction and radiation was studied in 1D for each regime, and the impact of\nperturbations on this power balance explored in 3D using a single\nRayleigh-Taylor spike. Heat flow into the spike from thermal conduction and\nalpha-heating increases by $\\sim2-3\\times$, due to sharper temperature\ngradients and increased proximity of the cold, dense material to the main\nfusion regions respectively. The radiative contribution remains largely\nunaffected in magnitude. Hydrodynamic scaling with capsule size and laser\nenergy of two perturbation scenarios (a short-wavelength multi-mode & a\nlow-mode radiation asymmetry) is explored in 3D, demonstrating the differing\nhydrodynamic evolution of the three alpha-heating regimes. The multi-mode yield\nincreases faster with scale factor due to more synchronous $PdV$ compression\nproducing higher temperatures and densities, and hence stronger bootstrapping.\nEffects on the hydrodynamic evolution are clearer for stronger alpha-heating\nregimes and include: reduced perturbation growth due to ablation from\nfire-polishing and stronger thermal conduction; sharper temperature and density\ngradients; and increased hotspot pressures which further compress the shell,\nincrease hotspot size and induce faster re-expansion. Faster expansion into\nregions of weak confinement is more prominent for stronger alpha-heating\nregimes, and can result in loss of confinement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 16:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-30"}

Two decisions are made to schedule jobs on\nthe batch processing machine, namely grouping jobs to form batches and\nsequencing the batches on the machines. Both the decisions are interdependent\nas the composition of the batch affects the processing time of the batch. The\nproblem under study is NP-hard. Consequently, solving a mathematical\nformulation to find an optimal solution is computationally intensive.

The Ap stars that rotate extremely slowly, with periods of decades\nto centuries, represent one of the keys to the understanding of the processes\nleading to the differentiation of stellar rotation.\n  Aims. We characterise the variations of the magnetic field of the Ap star HD\n50169 and derive constraints about its structure.\n  Methods. We combine published measurements of the mean longitudinal field\n<Bz> of HD 50169 with new determinations of this field moment from circular\nspectropolarimetry obtained at the 6-m telescope BTA of the Special\nAstrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. For the mean\nmagnetic field modulus <B>, literature data are complemented by the analysis of\nESO spectra, both newly acquired and from the archive.

In serverless computing, programmers write what are called serverless\nfunctions, and the cloud platform transparently manages the operating system,\nresource allocation, load-balancing, and fault tolerance. When demand for the\nservice spikes, the platform automatically allocates additional hardware to the\nservice and manages load-balancing; when demand falls, the platform silently\ndeallocates idle resources; and when the platform detects a failure, it\ntransparently retries affected requests. In 2014, Amazon Web Services\nintroduced the first serverless platform, AWS Lambda, and similar abstractions\nare now available on all major cloud computing platforms.\n  Unfortunately, the serverless computing abstraction exposes several low-level\noperational details that make it hard for programmers to write and reason about\ntheir code.

These\nresults are in sharp contrast to interactions of ions (monovalent and divalent)\nwith rigid charged rods in which ion condensation is uniform and position\nindependent.

The potential also\ncontains regions suitable for inflation, and gives rise to a natural type of\ndark matter. First-order phase transitions from one minimum to the vicinity of\nanother play the role of big bangs and produce many bubbles containing evolving\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universes. The great majority either\ncollapse in a tiny fraction of a second, or expand exponentially forever as\nempty, structureless universes. However, restricting to those bubble universes\nthat form non-linear structure at some time in their history we find\ncosmologies that look remarkably similar to ours. They undergo about 60 efolds\nof inflation, making them flat, homogeneous and isotropic, and endowing them\nwith a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of primordial density perturbations with\nroughly the observed magnitude and tilt. They reheat after inflation to a\nperiod of radiation domination, followed by matter domination with roughly the\nobserved abundance, followed by vacuum energy domination at roughly the\nobserved density. None of these features require any model building or small\nparameters. Instead, all dimensionful parameters in the theory can be set equal\nto the grand unified scale 0.01 M_p, and the dimensionless parameters are order\none and can be chosen randomly. The small value of dark energy ultimately comes\nfrom non-perturbative gravitational effects, giving an exponentially small\nvacuum energy density.

Using a suite of 50 multi-GC\nN-body simulations that match observational constraints on both the stellar\ncomponent of NGC1052-DF2 and its GC population but differ in the initial\nline-of-sight positions and the tangential velocities of the GCs, we show that\nthere is a substantial amount of realization-to-realization variance in the\nevolution of the GCs.

In order to answer these questions, two\nimportant ingredients are needed: 1) data from observations and 2) a\ntheoretical model that allows fast comparison between observation and theory.\nMost of the cosmological surveys observe galaxies, which are very difficult to\nmodel theoretically due to the complicated physics involved in their formation\nand evolution; modeling realistic galaxies over cosmological volumes requires\nrunning computationally expensive hydrodynamic simulations that can cost\nmillions of CPU hours. In this paper, we propose to use deep learning to\nestablish a mapping between the 3D galaxy distribution in hydrodynamic\nsimulations and its underlying dark matter distribution. One of the major\nchallenges in this pursuit is the very high sparsity in the predicted galaxy\ndistribution. To this end, we develop a two-phase convolutional neural network\narchitecture to generate fast galaxy catalogues, and compare our results\nagainst a standard cosmological technique. We find that our proposed approach\neither outperforms or is competitive with traditional cosmological techniques.\nCompared to the common methods used in cosmology, our approach also provides a\nnice trade-off between time-consumption (comparable to fastest benchmark in the\nliterature) and the quality and accuracy of the predicted simulation.

Because verifying the\ncorrectness of neural networks is extremely challenging, it is common to focus\non the verification of other properties of these systems. One important\nproperty, in particular, is robustness. Most existing definitions of\nrobustness, however, focus on the worst-case scenario where the inputs are\nadversarial. Such notions of robustness are too strong, and unlikely to be\nsatisfied by-and verifiable for-practical neural networks. Observing that\nreal-world inputs to neural networks are drawn from non-adversarial probability\ndistributions, we propose a novel notion of robustness: probabilistic\nrobustness, which requires the neural network to be robust with at least $(1 -\n\\epsilon)$ probability with respect to the input distribution. This\nprobabilistic approach is practical and provides a principled way of estimating\nthe robustness of a neural network. We also present an algorithm, based on\nabstract interpretation and importance sampling, for checking whether a neural\nnetwork is probabilistically robust. Our algorithm uses abstract interpretation\nto approximate the behavior of a neural network and compute an\noverapproximation of the input regions that violate robustness. It then uses\nimportance sampling to counter the effect of such overapproximation and compute\nan accurate estimate of the probability that the neural network violates the\nrobustness property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 20:44:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-19"}

However, for\nthe GFCC to be routinely used in the electronic structure calculations, robust\nnumerical techniques and approximations must be employed to reduce its high\ncomputational overhead. In our recent studies, we demonstrated that the GFCC\nequations can be solved directly in the frequency domain using iterative linear\nsolvers, which can be easily distributed in a massively parallel environment.\nIn the present work, we demonstrate a successful application of\nmodel-order-reduction (MOR) techniques in the GFCC framework. Briefly, for a\nfrequency regime which requires high resolution spectral function, instead of\nsolving GFCC linear equation of full dimension for every single frequency\npoint, an efficiently-solvable linear system model of a reduced dimension may\nbe built upon projecting the original GFCC linear system onto a subspace. From\nthis reduced order model is obtained a reasonable approximation to the full\ndimensional GFCC linear equations in both interpolative and extrapolative\nspectral regions. Here, we show that the subspace can be properly constructed\nin an iterative manner from the auxiliary vectors of the GFCC linear equations\nat some selected frequencies within the spectral region of interest. During the\niterations, the quality of the subspace and the linear system model can be\nsystematically improved. The method is tested in terms of the efficiency and\naccuracy of computing spectral functions for some typical molecular systems\nsuch as carbon monoxide, 1,3-butadiene, benzene, and adenine. As a byproduct,\nthe obtained reduced order model may provide a high quality initial guess which\nimproves the convergence rate for the existing iterative linear solver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Feb 2019 00:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-18"}

When heterogeneous CR networks that are based on different\nwireless standards operate in the same TVWS, coexistence issues can potentially\ncause major problems. Enabling collaborative coexistence via direct\ncoordination between heterogeneous CR networks is very challenging, due to\nincompatible MAC/PHY designs of coexisting networks, requirement of an\nover-the-air common control channel for inter-network communications, and time\nsynchronization across devices from different networks. Moreover, such a\ncoexistence scheme would require competing networks or service providers to\nexchange sensitive control information that may raise conflict of interest\nissues and customer privacy concerns. In this paper, we present an architecture\nfor enabling collaborative coexistence of heterogeneous CR networks over TVWS,\ncalled Symbiotic Heterogeneous coexistence ARchitecturE (SHARE). Define\n\"indirect coordination\" first before using it. Because coexistence cannot avoid\ncoordination By mimicking the symbiotic relationships between heterogeneous\norganisms in a stable ecosystem, SHARE establishes an indirect coordination\nmechanism between heterogeneous CR networks via a mediator system, which avoids\nthe drawbacks of direct coordination. SHARE includes two spectrum sharing\nalgorithms whose designs were inspired by well-known models and theories from\ntheoretical ecology, viz, the interspecific competition model and the ideal\nfree distribution model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Feb 2019 03:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-19"}

However, detecting tiny objects in\nlarge-scale remote sensing images still remains challenging. First, the extreme\nlarge input size makes the existing object detection solutions too slow for\npractical use. Second, the massive and complex backgrounds cause serious false\nalarms. Moreover, the ultratiny objects increase the difficulty of accurate\ndetection. To tackle these problems, we propose a unified and self-reinforced\nnetwork called remote sensing region-based convolutional neural network\n($\\mathcal{R}^2$-CNN), composing of backbone Tiny-Net, intermediate global\nattention block, and final classifier and detector. Tiny-Net is a lightweight\nresidual structure, which enables fast and powerful features extraction from\ninputs. Global attention block is built upon Tiny-Net to inhibit false\npositives. Classifier is then used to predict the existence of targets in each\npatch, and detector is followed to locate them accurately if available. The\nclassifier and detector are mutually reinforced with end-to-end training, which\nfurther speed up the process and avoid false alarms. Effectiveness of\n$\\mathcal{R}^2$-CNN is validated on hundreds of GF-1 images and GF-2 images\nthat are 18 000 $\\times$ 18 192 pixels, 2.0-m resolution, and 27 620 $\\times$\n29 200 pixels, 0.8-m resolution, respectively. Specifically, we can process a\nGF-1 image in 29.4 s on Titian X just with single thread.

The network evolved in parallel with technology (e.g.,\nfaster trains) and under strong constraints, such as preserving a good\npopulation coverage and balancing cost and efficiency.

Starting with the fluid parameters for an FSM in a straight\ntube with equilibrium parameters largely compatible with the IRIS measurements,\nwe synthesize the line profiles by incorporating the non-Equilibrium Ionization\n(NEI) effect in the computation of the contribution function. We find that both\nthe intensity and Doppler shift oscillate at the wave period ($P$). The phase\ndifference between the two differs from the expected value ($90^\\circ$) only\nslightly because NEI plays only a marginal role in determining the ionic\nfraction of Fe XXI in the examined dense loop. The Doppler width modulations,\nhowever, posses an asymmetry in the first and second halves of a wave period,\nleading to a secondary periodicity at $P/2$ in addition to the primary one at\n$P$.

The\n\"unphysical\" metric $\\tilde g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is related to the $(2+1)$-dimensional\nKerr spacetime. The equation for the angular momentum $J$ decouples, for the\nvacuum situation as well as for global strings, from the other field equations\nand delivers a kind of spin-mass relation.

The formation of closed timelike curves can\nbe pushed to space infinity for suitable values of the parameters and the\nviolation of the weak energy condition can be avoided.

Both the\nagent and the treasure are modeled as points. This is a variant of the task\nknown as treasure hunt. The treasure is at a distance at most $D$ from the\ninitial position of the agent, and the agent finds the treasure when it gets at\ndistance $r$ from it, called the {\\em vision radius}. However, the agent does\nnot know the location of the treasure and does not know the parameters $D$ and\n$r$. The cost of finding the treasure is the length of the trajectory of the\nagent. We investigate the tradeoffs between the amount of information held {\\em\na priori} by the agent and the cost of treasure hunt.

However, the consequences of the\nexistence of a classical (critical) phase transition on the corresponding\nquantum state has been mostly ignored. This is particularly interesting since\nthe classical partition function exhibits non-analytic behavior at the critical\npoint and such behavior could have important consequences on the quantum side.\nIn this paper, we consider this problem for an important example of Kitaev\ntoric code model which has been shown to correspond to the two-dimensional (2D)\nIsing model though a duality transformation. Through such duality\ntransformation, it is shown that the temperature on the classical side is\nmapped to bit-flip noise on the quantum side. It is then shown that a\ntransition from a coherent superposition of a given quantum state to a\nnon-coherent mixture corresponds exactly to paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase\ntransition in the Ising model. To identify such a transition further, we define\nan order parameter to characterize the decoherency of such a mixture and show\nthat it behaves similar to the order parameter (magnetization) of 2D Ising\nmodel, a behavior that is interpreted as a robust coherency in the toric code\nmodel. Furthermore, we consider other properties of the noisy toric code model\nexactly at the critical point. We show that there is a relative stability to\nnoise for the toric code state at the critical noise which is revealed by a\nrelative reduction in susceptibility to noise. We close the paper with a\ndiscussion on connection between the robust coherency as well as the critical\nstability with topological order of the toric code model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Feb 2019 13:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-13"}

Skeletons of\nassociahedra, for instance, are the graphs induced by quadrilateral flips in\ntriangulations of a convex polygon. For some definition of a flip graph, a\nnatural computational problem to consider is the flip distance: Given two\nobjects, what is the minimum number of flips needed to transform one into the\nother?\n  We consider flip graphs on orientations of simple graphs, where flips consist\nof reversing the direction of some edges. More precisely, we consider so-called\n$\\alpha$-orientations of a graph $G$, in which every vertex $v$ has a specified\noutdegree $\\alpha(v)$, and a flip consists of reversing all edges of a directed\ncycle. We prove that deciding whether the flip distance between two\n$\\alpha$-orientations of a planar graph $G$ is at most two is \\NP-complete.\nThis also holds in the special case of perfect matchings, where flips involve\nalternating cycles. This problem amounts to finding geodesics on the common\nbase polytope of two partition matroids, or, alternatively, on an alcoved\npolytope. It therefore provides an interesting example of a flip distance\nquestion that is computationally intractable despite having a natural\ninterpretation as a geodesic on a nicely structured combinatorial polytope.\n  We also consider the dual question of the flip distance betwe en graph\norientations in which every cycle has a specified number of forward edges, and\na flip is the reversal of all edges in a minimal directed cut. In general, the\nproblem remains hard. However, if we restrict to flips that only change sinks\ninto sources, or vice-versa, then the problem can be solved in polynomial time.\nHere we exploit the fact that the flip graph is the cover graph of a\ndistributive lattice.

Getafix is based on a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm\nthat summarizes fix patterns into a hierarchy ranging from general to specific\npatterns. Instead of a computationally expensive exploration of a potentially\nlarge space of candidate fixes, Getafix uses a simple yet effective ranking\ntechnique that uses the context of a code change to select the most appropriate\nfix for a given bug. Our evaluation applies Getafix to 1,268 bug fixes for six\nbug categories reported by popular static analyzers for Java, including null\ndereferences, incorrect API calls, and misuses of particular language\nconstructs.

Here, we apply the\nmethod of manufactured solutions (MMS) to verify a commercial finite element\ncode for elastostatic solid mechanics analyses using linear-elastic,\nhyperelastic (neo-Hookean), and quasi-hyperelastic (Hencky) constitutive\nmodels. Analytical source terms are generated using either Python/SymPy or\nMathematica and are implemented in ABAQUS/Standard without modification to the\nsolver source code.

Refinement studies reveal second-order displacement convergence\nin response to mesh refinement for all constitutive models and first-order\ndisplacement convergence in response to increment refinement for the\nfinite-strain problems.

These settings\nare often modeled with illness-death models for the hazards of the terminal and\nnonterminal events, but evaluating causal treatment effects with hazard models\nis problematic due to conditioning on survival (a post-treatment outcome) that\nis embedded in the definition of a hazard. Extending an existing survivor\naverage causal effect (SACE) estimand, we frame the evaluation of treatment\neffects in the context of semicompeting risks with principal stratification and\nintroduce two new causal estimands: the time-varying survivor average causal\neffect (TV-SACE) and the restricted mean survivor average causal effect\n(RM-SACE). These principal causal effects are defined among units that would\nsurvive regardless of assigned treatment. We adopt a Bayesian estimation\nprocedure that parameterizes illness-death models for both treatment arms.

However, their learning performance varies significantly\ndepending on the function or the solution space that they attempt to\napproximate. This is mainly because of their homogenous configuration based\nsolely on the linear neuron model. Therefore, while they learn very well those\nproblems with a monotonous, relatively simple and linearly separable solution\nspace, they may entirely fail to do so when the solution space is highly\nnonlinear and complex. Sharing the same linear neuron model with two additional\nconstraints (local connections and weight sharing), this is also true for the\nconventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and, it is, therefore, not\nsurprising that in many challenging problems only the deep CNNs with a massive\ncomplexity and depth can achieve the required diversity and the learning\nperformance.

Analysis of resilient market performance, therefore, becomes\nuseful for investors. From a systems perspective, this paper proposes a novel\nfunction-based resilience metric that considers the effect of two\nfault-tolerance thresholds: the Robustness Range (RR) and the Elasticity\nThreshold (ET). We examined the consecutive resilience cycles and their\ndynamics in the performance of two stock markets, NASDAQ and SSE. The proposed\nmetric was also compared with three well-documented resilience models. The\nresults showed that this new metric could satisfactorily quantify the\ntime-varying resilience cycles in the multi-cycle volatile performance of stock\nmarkets while also being more feasible in comparative analysis. Furthermore,\nanalysis of dynamics revealed that those consecutive resilience cycles in\nmarket performance were distributed non-linearly, following a power-law\nbehavior in the upper tail. Finally, sensitivity tests demonstrated the\nlarge-value resilience cycles were relatively sensitive to changes in RR. In\npractice, RR could indicate investors' psychological capability to withstand\ndownturns. It supports the observation that perception on the market's\nresilient responses may vary among investors. This study provides a new tool\nand valuable insight for researchers, practitioners, and investors when\nevaluating market performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Feb 2019 06:18:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}
