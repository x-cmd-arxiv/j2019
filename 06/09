In this model, clusters are ranked by size and partitioned into small-\nand large-cluster sets.

This research direction draws increasing\nattention in research areas such as economics, healthcare, and education. For\nexample, we can study how a medicine (the treatment) causally affects the\nhealth condition (the outcome) of a patient using existing electronic health\nrecords. To validate causal effects learned from observational data, we have to\ncontrol confounding bias -- the influence of variables which causally influence\nboth the treatment and the outcome. Existing work along this line\noverwhelmingly relies on the unconfoundedness assumption that there do not\nexist unobserved confounders. However, this assumption is untestable and can\neven be untenable. In fact, an important fact ignored by the majority of\nprevious work is that observational data can come with network information that\ncan be utilized to infer hidden confounders. For example, in an observational\nstudy of the individual-level treatment effect of a medicine, instead of\nrandomized experiments, the medicine is often assigned to each individual based\non a series of factors. Some of the factors (e.g., socioeconomic status) can be\nchallenging to measure and therefore become hidden confounders. Fortunately,\nthe socioeconomic status of an individual can be reflected by whom she is\nconnected in social networks. With this fact in mind, we aim to exploit the\nnetwork information to recognize patterns of hidden confounders which would\nfurther allow us to learn valid individual causal effects from observational\ndata. In this work, we propose a novel causal inference framework, the network\ndeconfounder, which learns representations to unravel patterns of hidden\nconfounders from the network information. Empirically, we perform extensive\nexperiments to validate the effectiveness of the network deconfounder on\nvarious datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jun 2019 16:23:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 05:31:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2019 21:51:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations on\nsemi-flexible, repulsive bead-spring chains of which one of the two end beads\nattract each other. We calculate the phase diagram as a function of both the\nvolume fraction of the chains and the strength of the attractive potential. We\nidentify a large number of phases that include isotropic, nematic, smectic A,\nsmectic B and crystalline states. For tip attraction energies lower than the\nthermal energy, our results are qualitatively consistent with experimental\nfindings: we find that an increase of the attraction strength shifts the\nnematic to smectic A phase transition to lower volume fractions, with only\nminor effect on the stability of the other phases. For sufficiently strong tip\nattraction, the nematic phase disappears completely, in addition leading to the\ndestabilisation of the isotropic phase. In order to better understand the\nunderlying physics of these phenomena, we also investigate the clustering of\nthe particles at their attractive tips and the effective molecular field\nexperienced by the particles in the smectic A phase. Based on these results, we\nargue that the clustering of the tips only affects the phase stability if\nlamellar structures (``micelles'') are formed. We find that an increase of the\nattraction strength increases the degree of order in the layered\nphases.Interestingly, we also find evidence for the existence of an\nanti-ferroelectric smectic A phase transition induced by the interaction\nbetween the tips. A simple Maier-Saupe-McMillan model confirms our findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jun 2019 18:34:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

The performance of tomographic adaptive\noptics is strongly dependent on the vertical distribution (profile) of this\nturbulence. An important way in which this manifests is the tomographic error,\narising from imperfect measurement and reconstruction of the turbulent phase at\naltitude. Conventionally, a small number of reference profiles are used to\nobtain this error in simulation however these profiles are not constructed to\nbe representative in terms of tomographic error. It is therefore unknown\nwhether these simulations are providing realistic performance estimates. Here,\nwe employ analytical adaptive optics simulation that drastically reduces\ncomputation times to compute tomographic error for 10 691 measurements of the\nturbulence profile gathered by the Stereo-SCIDAR instrument at ESO Paranal. We\nassess for the first time the impact of the profile on tomographic error in a\nstatistical manner. We find, in agreement with previous work, that the\ntomographic error is most directly linked with the distribution of turbulence\ninto discrete, stratified layers. Reference profiles are found to provide\nmostly higher tomographic error than expected, which we attribute to the fact\nthat these profiles are primarily composed of averages of many measurements\nresulting in unrealistic, continuous distributions of turbulence.

Often such flexible policies are not desirable, and\nthe decision maker may need to commit to a set of actions for a number of\nplanning periods. Two-stage stochastic programming might be better suited to\nsuch settings, where the decisions for all periods are made here-and-now and do\nnot adapt to the uncertainty realized. In this paper, we propose a novel\nalternative approach, where the stages are not predetermined but part of the\noptimization problem. Each component of the decision policy has an associated\nrevision point, a period prior to which the decision is predetermined and after\nwhich it is revised to adjust to the uncertainty realized thus far.

For Earth,\nthis extreme climate transition is thought to occur for a ~6% increase only of\nthe solar luminosity, though the exact limit at which the transition would\noccur is still a highly debated topic. In general, the runaway greenhouse is\nbelieved to be a fundamental process in the evolution of Earth-size, temperate\nplanets. Using 1-D radiative-convective climate calculations accounting for\nthick, hot water vapour-dominated atmospheres, we evaluate the transit\natmospheric thickness of a post-runaway greenhouse atmosphere, and find that it\ncould possibly reach over a thousand kilometers (i.e., a few tens of % of Earth\nradius).

To better understand controversial issues, one needs to\nview them from a diverse yet comprehensive set of perspectives.

However, due to the lack of annotations on contextual\nobjects and their relationships, existing methods degenerate the above joint\ngrounding process into a holistic association between the expression and\nregions, thus suffering from unsatisfactory performance and limited\ninterpretability. In this paper, we alleviate the missing-annotation problem\nand enable the joint reasoning by leveraging the language scene graph which\ncovers both labeled referent and unlabeled contexts (other objects, attributes,\nand relationships). Specifically, the language scene graph is a graphical\nrepresentation where the nodes are objects with attributes and the edges are\nrelationships.

The impact of the rotation parameter ($a$) and the\ngauge coupling constant ($g$) on the behaviour of horizon and ergoregion of the\nBH is studied. It is of interest to note that, compared with the extremal Kerr\nBH, the gauge coupling constant, under certain constraints, can enhance the\nmaximum efficiency of energy extraction by the Penrose process almost double.\nUnder the same constraints, we can extract approximately 60.75\\% of the initial\nmass energy from the BH which is noticeably higher in contrast to the extremal\nKerr BH.

In this scenario, where the standard model (SM)\nis extended by three gauge singlet fermions and one additional scalar doublet,\nall odd under an in-built $Z_2$ symmetry, the lightest singlet fermion which\nalso happens to be the lightest $Z_2$ odd particle, can be either thermal or\nnon-thermal DM candidate depending upon the strength of its couplings with SM\nleptons and the $Z_2$ odd scalar doublet. In both the scenarios, the $Z_2$ odd\nscalar doublet plays a non-trivial role either by assisting coannihilation with\nthermal DM or by providing a source for non-thermal DM via decay. The heavier\n$Z_2$ odd singlet fermion produces a net lepton asymmetry through its\nout-of-equilibrium decay into SM leptons and $Z_2$ odd scalar doublet.

Recent work in systems\nwithout sharing has shown that redundancy can improve performance considerably.\nIn this paper, we combine partial sharing and redundancy by developing partial\nsharing models for providers operating multi-server systems with redundancy.\nTwo M/M/N queues with redundant service models are considered. Copies of an\narriving job are placed in the queues of servers that can serve the job.\nPartial sharing models for cancel-on-complete and cancel-on-start redundancy\nmodels are developed. For cancel-on-complete, it is shown that the Pareto\nefficient region is the full pooling configuration. For a cancel-on-start\npolicy, we conjecture that the Pareto frontier is always non-empty and is such\nthat at least one of the two providers is sharing all of its resources. For\nthis system, using bargaining theory the sharing configuration that the\nproviders may use is determined.

The method consists of two passes of denoising\nfollowed by a voice activity detection (VAD) stage. In the first pass,\nhigh-energy segments in a speech signal are detected by using a posteriori\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) weighted energy difference and if no pitch is\ndetected within a segment, the segment is considered as a high-energy noise\nsegment and set to zero. In the second pass, the speech signal is denoised by a\nspeech enhancement method, for which several methods are explored. Next,\nneighbouring frames with pitch are grouped together to form pitch segments, and\nbased on speech statistics, the pitch segments are further extended from both\nends in order to include both voiced and unvoiced sounds and likely non-speech\nparts as well. In the end, a posteriori SNR weighted energy difference is\napplied to the extended pitch segments of the denoised speech signal for\ndetecting voice activity. We evaluate the VAD performance of the proposed\nmethod using two databases, RATS and Aurora-2, which contain a large variety of\nnoise conditions. The rVAD method is further evaluated, in terms of speaker\nverification performance, on the RedDots 2016 challenge database and its\nnoise-corrupted versions. Experiment results show that rVAD is compared\nfavourably with a number of existing methods. In addition, we present a\nmodified version of rVAD where computationally intensive pitch extraction is\nreplaced by computationally efficient spectral flatness calculation. The\nmodified version significantly reduces the computational complexity at the cost\nof moderately inferior VAD performance, which is an advantage when processing a\nlarge amount of data and running on low resource devices.

We construct a Bayesian\nframework to statistically compare models with additional fields given the\ncurrent astronomical data. Putting inflation to the test, we perform our\nanalysis on the quadratic curvaton accompanying a range of inflationary\npotentials, where we find that only one potential remains as a viable\ncandidate. Furthermore, if the curvaton mechanism were to be confirmed by\nfuture non-Gaussianity measurements (from large scale structure surveys), the\nmodel could prove to be tremendously informative of the early inflationary\nhistory. The initial conditions given to these scalar fields become apparent\nwhen considering their fundamentally quantum behaviour. Taking this physics\ninto account leads us to develop detailed models for post-inflationary\nphenomenology (namely, the curvaton and freeze-in dark matter models) and to\ndiscover powerful new probes of inflation itself.

The thesis finishes with a\ndiscussion of the future prospects for inflationary model selection.

Most existing works on estimating ROA\nrely on analytical Lyapunov functions, which are subject to two limitations:\nthe analytic Lyapunov functions may not be always readily available, and the\nresulting ROA may be overly conservative. This work overcomes these two\nlimitations by leveraging the converse Lyapunov theorem in control theory to\neliminate the need of an analytic Lyapunov function and learning the unknown\nLyapunov function with the Gaussian Process (GP) approach. In addition, a\nGaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (GP-UCB) based sampling algorithm is\ndesigned to reconcile the trade-off between the exploitation for enlarging the\nROA and the exploration for reducing the uncertainty of sampling region. Within\nthe constructed ROA, it is guaranteed in probability that the system state will\nconverge to the stable equilibrium with a confidence level. Numerical\nsimulations are also conducted to validate the assessment approach for the ROA\nof the single machine infinite bus system and the New England $39$-bus system.\nNumerical results demonstrate that our approach can significantly enlarge the\nestimated ROA compared to that of the analytic Lyapunov counterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jun 2019 08:13:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}

A promising high level approach\ntackling this limitation is knowledge distillation, which let small student\nmodel mimic cumbersome teacher model's output to get improved generalization.\nHowever, related methods mainly focus on simple task of classification while do\nnot consider complex tasks like object detection. We show applying the vanilla\nknowledge distillation to detection model gets minor gain. To address the\nchallenge of distilling knowledge in detection model, we propose a fine-grained\nfeature imitation method exploiting the cross-location discrepancy of feature\nresponse. Our intuition is that detectors care more about local near object\nregions. Thus the discrepancy of feature response on the near object anchor\nlocations reveals important information of how teacher model tends to\ngeneralize. We design a novel mechanism to estimate those locations and let\nstudent model imitate the teacher on them to get enhanced performance. We first\nvalidate the idea on a developed lightweight toy detector which carries\nsimplest notion of current state-of-the-art anchor based detection models on\nchallenging KITTI dataset, our method generates up to 15% boost of mAP for the\nstudent model compared to the non-imitated counterpart. We then extensively\nevaluate the method with Faster R-CNN model under various scenarios with common\nobject detection benchmark of Pascal VOC and COCO, imitation alleviates up to\n74% performance drop of student model compared to teacher.

Moreover, we also carefully analyze existing evaluation protocols for\nage estimation, finding that the overlap in identity between the training and\ntesting sets affects the relative performance of different age encoding\nmethods. Finally, since existing face databases for age estimation are\ngenerally small, deep models tend to suffer from an overfitting problem. To\naddress this issue, we propose a novel regularization strategy to encourage\ndeep models to learn more robust features from facial parts for age estimation\npurposes. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed techniques improve\nthe age estimation performance; moreover, we achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on the three most popular age databases, $i.e.$, Morph II,\nCLAP2015, and CLAP2016.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jun 2019 12:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}

Several approaches have been developed to get\nearly estimations of area and yield, the two components of crop production. The\nmost common methods, based on Earth observation data, are image classification\nfor crop area and correlation with vegetation index for crop yield. Regardless\nof the approach used, early estimators of cropland area, crop area or crop\nyield should have an accuracy providing lower production error than existing\nhistorical crop statistics. The objective of this study is to develop a\nmethodological framework to define the accuracy requirements for early\nestimators of cropland area, crop area and crop yield in Senegal. These\nrequirements are made according to (i) the inter-annual variability and the\ntrend of historical data, (ii) the calendar of official statistics data\ncollection, and (iii) the time at which early estimations of cropland area,\ncrop area and crop yield can theoretically be available. This framework is\napplied to the seven main crops in Senegal using 20 years of crop production\ndata. Results show that the inter-annual variability of crop yield is the main\nfactor limiting the accuracy of pre-harvest production forecast. Estimators of\ncropland area can be used to improve production prediction of groundnuts,\nmillet and rice, the three main crops in Senegal stressing the value of\ncropland mapping for food security. While applied to Senegal, this study could\neasily be reproduced in any country where reliable agricultural statistics are\navailable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jun 2019 12:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}

The obtained ABCD matrices\nfor equivalent interfaces capture the non-local effects due to the evanescent\ntransverse magnetic (TM) WM mode and in part due to the propagating transverse\nelectromagnetic (TEM) WM mode. This enables one to characterize the overall\nresponse of bounded WM structures by cascading the ABCD matrices of equivalent\nWM interfaces and WM slabs as transmission lines supporting only the\npropagating TEM WM mode, resulting in a simple circuit-model formalism for\nbounded WM structures with arbitrary terminations, including the open-end,\npatch/slot arrays, and thin metal/2D material, among others. The individual\nABCD matrices for equivalent WM interfaces apparently violate the conservation\nof energy and reciprocity, and therefore, the equivalent interfaces apparently\nbehave as non-reciprocal lossy or active systems. However, the overall response\nof a bounded WM structure is consistent with the lossless property maintaining\nthe conservation of energy and reciprocity. These unusual features are\nexplained by the fact that in the non-local WM the Poynting vector has an\nadditional correction term which takes into account a \"hidden power\" due to\nnon-local effects. Results are obtained for various numerical examples\ndemonstrating a rapid and efficient solution for bounded WM structures,\nincluding the case of geometrically complex multilayer configurations with\narbitrary terminations, subject to the condition that WM interfaces are\ndecoupled by the evanescent TM WM mode below the plasma frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jun 2019 13:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

One common theme in these discussions is the\nthesis that the ability of a machine to conduct convincing dialogues with human\nbeings can serve as at least a sufficient criterion of AGI. We argue that this\nvery ability should be accepted also as a necessary condition of AGI, and we\nprovide a description of the nature of human dialogue in particular and of\nhuman language in general against this background. We then argue that it is for\nmathematical reasons impossible to program a machine in such a way that it\ncould master human dialogue behaviour in its full generality. This is (1)\nbecause there are no traditional explicitly designed mathematical models that\ncould be used as a starting point for creating such programs; and (2) because\neven the sorts of automated models generated by using machine learning, which\nhave been used successfully in areas such as machine translation, cannot be\nextended to cope with human dialogue. If this is so, then we can conclude that\na Turing machine also cannot possess AGI, because it fails to fulfil a\nnecessary condition thereof. At the same time, however, we acknowledge the\npotential of Turing machines to master dialogue behaviour in highly restricted\ncontexts, where what is called ``narrow'' AI can still be of considerable\nutility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jun 2019 12:42:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 20:26:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-02"}
