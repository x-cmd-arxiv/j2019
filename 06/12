An important condition for a good\nSM polarizer is the matching of the substrate SLD (Scattering Length Density)\nwith the SM coating SLD for spin-down neutrons. For traditional Fe/Si SM on Si\nsubstrate, this SLD step is positive when a neutron goes from the substrate to\nthe SM, which leads to a significant loss of the polarizer performance at small\nQ. Instead, we use single-crystal Sapphire/Quartz substrates. The latter show a\nnegative SLD step for spin-down neutrons at the interface with Fe and,\ntherefore, avoid the total reflection regime at small Q. To optimize the\npolarizer performance, we formulate the concept of Sapphire V-bender, perform\nray-tracing simulations of Sapphire V-bender, compare results with those for\ntraditional C-bender on Si, and study experimentally V-bender prototypes with\ndifferent substrates. Our results show that the choice of substrate material,\npolarizer geometry and the strength and quality of magnetizing field have\ndramatic effect.

However, automatic\nsegmentation is often hampered by motion artifacts caused by infant head\nmovements during image acquisition. Methods have been developed to remove or\nminimize these artifacts during image reconstruction using frequency domain\ndata. However, frequency domain data might not always be available. Hence, in\nthis study we propose a method for removing motion artifacts from the already\nreconstructed MR scans. The method employs a generative adversarial network\ntrained with a cycle consistency loss to transform slices affected by motion\ninto slices without motion artifacts, and vice versa. In the experiments 40\nT2-weighted coronal MR scans of preterm born infants imaged at 30 weeks\npostmenstrual age were used. All images contained slices affected by motion\nartifacts hampering automatic tissue segmentation. To evaluate whether\ncorrection allows more accurate image segmentation, the images were segmented\ninto 8 tissue classes: cerebellum, myelinated white matter, basal ganglia and\nthalami, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, brain stem, cortical\ngray matter, and extracerebral cerebrospinal fluid.

ProPublica's COMPAS data is used in an\nincreasing number of studies to test various definitions of algorithmic\nfairness. This paper takes a closer look at the actual datasets put together by\nProPublica. In particular, the sub-datasets built to study the likelihood of\nrecidivism within two years of a defendant's original COMPAS survey screening\ndate. I take a new yet simple approach to visualize these data, by analyzing\nthe distribution of defendants across COMPAS screening dates. I find that\nProPublica made an important data processing error when it created these\ndatasets, failing to implement a two-year sample cutoff rule for recidivists in\nsuch datasets (whereas it implemented a two-year sample cutoff rule for\nnon-recidivists). When I implement a simple two-year COMPAS screen date cutoff\nrule for recidivists, I estimate that in the two-year general recidivism\ndataset ProPublica kept over 40% more recidivists than it should have. This\nfundamental problem in dataset construction affects some statistics more than\nothers. It obviously has a substantial impact on the recidivism rate;\nartificially inflating it. For the two-year general recidivism dataset created\nby ProPublica, the two-year recidivism rate is 45.1%, whereas, with the simple\nCOMPAS screen date cutoff correction I implement, it is 36.2%. Thus, the\ntwo-year recidivism rate in ProPublica's dataset is inflated by over 24%. This\nalso affects the positive and negative predictive values. On the other hand,\nthis data processing error has little impact on some of the other key\nstatistical measures, which are less susceptible to changes in the relative\nshare of recidivists, such as the false positive and false negative rates, and\nthe overall accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 17:27:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 17:50:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 19:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

The cornerstone of volumetric and morphologic\nanalysis in fetal MRI is segmentation of the fetal brain into different tissue\nclasses. Manual segmentation is cumbersome and time consuming, hence automatic\nsegmentation could substantially simplify the procedure. However, automatic\nbrain tissue segmentation in these scans is challenging owing to artifacts\nincluding intensity inhomogeneity, caused in particular by spontaneous fetal\nmovements during the scan. Unlike methods that estimate the bias field to\nremove intensity inhomogeneity as a preprocessing step to segmentation, we\npropose to perform segmentation using a convolutional neural network that\nexploits images with synthetically introduced intensity inhomogeneity as data\naugmentation. The method first uses a CNN to extract the intracranial volume.\nThereafter, another CNN with the same architecture is employed to segment the\nextracted volume into seven brain tissue classes: cerebellum, basal ganglia and\nthalami, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, brain stem, cortical\ngray matter and extracerebral cerebrospinal fluid. To make the method\napplicable to slices showing intensity inhomogeneity artifacts, the training\ndata was augmented by applying a combination of linear gradients with random\noffsets and orientations to image slices without artifacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 17:28:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

Measurements\nof the turn-around radius hold promises of constraining cosmological\nparameters, and possibly even properties of gravity. Such a measurement is,\nhowever, complicated by the fact that the surroundings of galaxy clusters are\nnot spherical, but instead are a complicated collection of filaments, sheets\nand voids. In this paper we use the results of numerically simulated universes\nto quantify realistic error-bars of the measurement of the turn-around radius.\nWe find that for a $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology these error-bars are typically of the\norder of $20\\%$. We numerically simulate three different implementations of\ndark energy models and of a scalar dark sector interaction to address whether\nthe turn-around radius can be used to constrain non-trivial cosmologies, and we\nfind that only rather extreme models can be distinguished from a $\\Lambda$CDM\nuniverse due to the large error-bars arising from the non-trivial cluster\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:00:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 May 2020 19:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

When considering network data,\nregular convolutions do not hold since the data domain presents an irregular\nstructure given by the network topology.\n  In this work, we extend scattering transforms to network data by using\nmultiresolution graph wavelets, whose computation can be obtained by means of\ngraph convolutions. Furthermore, we prove that the resulting graph scattering\ntransforms are stable to metric perturbations of the underlying network. This\nrenders graph scattering transforms robust to changes on the network topology,\nmaking it particularly useful for cases of transfer learning, topology\nestimation or time-varying graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 19:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-13"}

These make\nthree useful diagnostics cleanly visible. (1.)

To address\nthis, dedicated foreground measurement experiments are being undertaken at\nradio frequencies between 2 and 40 GHz. Foreground polarized synchrotron\nemission measurements are particularly challenging, primarily due to the\ncomplicated frequency dependence in the presence of Faraday rotation, and are\nbest recovered through broad fractional-bandwidth polarization measurements at\nfrequencies $\\lesssim 5$ GHz. A unique opportunity for measuring the foreground\npolarized synchrotron emission will be provided by the 15-m SKA-MPG telescope\noperating in the frequency range 1.7 to 3.5~GHz (S-Band).

End users\noften have to face a dilemma in the preparation process: the more they know\nabout a knowledge domain, the easier it is for them to find the relevant data\nto meet their needs adequately; the little they know, the harder the problem\nis. What can we do to avoid missing something valuable but beyond our initial\ndescription? In this article, we introduce a flexible and generic methodology,\ncascading citation expansion, to increase the quality of constructing a\nbibliographic dataset for systematic reviews. Furthermore, the methodology\nsimplifies the conceptualization of globalism and localism in science mapping\nand unifies them on a consistent and continuous spectrum. We demonstrate an\napplication of the methodology to the research of literature-based discovery\nand compare five datasets constructed based on three use scenarios, namely a\nconventional keyword-based search (one dataset), an expansion process starting\nwith a groundbreaking article of the knowledge domain (two datasets), and an\nexpansion process starting with a recently published review article by a\nprominent expert in the domain (two datasets).

Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims at\nacquiring such reward functions through inference, allowing to generalize the\nresulting policy to states not observed in the past. This paper investigates\nwhether IRL can infer such rewards from agents within real financial stochastic\nenvironments: limit order books (LOB). We introduce a simple one-level LOB,\nwhere the interactions of a number of stochastic agents and an expert trading\nagent are modelled as a Markov decision process. We consider two cases for the\nexpert's reward: either a simple linear function of state features; or a\ncomplex, more realistic non-linear function. Given the expert agent's\ndemonstrations, we attempt to discover their strategy by modelling their latent\nreward function using linear and Gaussian process (GP) regressors from previous\nliterature, and our own approach through Bayesian neural networks (BNN). While\nthe three methods can learn the linear case, only the GP-based and our proposed\nBNN methods are able to discover the non-linear reward case. Our BNN IRL\nalgorithm outperforms the other two approaches as the number of samples\nincreases.

This connection has been difficult to show unequivocally, as other\nprocesses may also produce these features. Particularly, a photoelectric\ninstability (PEI) has been proposed, operating in gas-rich optically thin\ndisks, that generates structures predicted by planet--disk interactions. We\nexamine the question of how to disentangle planetary effects on disk structure\nfrom the effects of the PEI. We use the Pencil Code to perform 2D global\nhydrodynamical models of the dynamics of gas and dust in a thin disk, with and\nwithout planetary perturbers. Photoelectric heating is modeled with an equation\nof state where pressure is proportional to dust surface density. The drag force\non grains and its backreaction on the gas are included. Analyzing the situation\nwithout PEI, we find that gas--dust interactions alter the shape of the\nplanetary gap from the dust-free case when the local dust-to-gas ratio\n$\\varepsilon$ approaches unity. This result applies also to primordial disks,\nbecause dust drifting inwards accumulates at the edge of the planetary gap, and\nany initial dust-to-gas ratio eventually achieves $\\varepsilon=1$ if the dust\nreservoir is sufficient. We find a result particular to high dust-to-gas ratio\ndisks as well: as dust drifts inwards, the dust front becomes a sharp\ntransition, and the backreaction triggers the Rossby wave instability. When PEI\nis included, we find that it obscures structures induced by planets unless the\nplanet's mass is sufficiently large to carve a noticeable gap. Specifically,\nthe instability generates arcs and rings of regular spacing: a planet is\ndiscernible when it carves a dust gap wider than the wavelength of the PEI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 20:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

P-GNN first\nsamples sets of anchor nodes, computes the distance of a given target node to\neach anchor-set,and then learns a non-linear distance-weighted aggregation\nscheme over the anchor-sets. This way P-GNNs can capture positions/locations of\nnodes with respect to the anchor nodes. P-GNNs have several advantages: they\nare inductive, scalable,and can incorporate node feature information. We apply\nP-GNNs to multiple prediction tasks including link prediction and community\ndetection. We show that P-GNNs consistently outperform state of the art GNNs,\nwith up to 66% improvement in terms of the ROC AUC score.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 20:52:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 18:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-17"}

While various existing algorithms can efficiently\ncompute optimal journeys in either a pure public transit network or a pure\ntransfer graph, combining the two increases running times significantly.\nExisting approaches therefore typically only support limited walking between\nstops, either by imposing a maximum transfer distance or by requiring the\ntransfer graph to be transitively closed.

Prior work on exploiting edge pixels instead\ntreats edges as features and employ various techniques to match edge lines or\npixels, which adds unnecessary complexity. Direct methods typically operate on\nall pixel intensities, which proves to be highly redundant. In contrast our\nmethod builds on direct visual odometry methods naturally with minimal added\ncomputation. It is not only more efficient than direct dense methods since we\niterate with a fraction of the pixels, but also more accurate. We achieve high\naccuracy and efficiency by extracting edges from only one image, and utilize\nrobust Gauss-Newton to minimize the photometric error of these edge pixels.\nThis simultaneously finds the edge pixels in the reference image, as well as\nthe relative camera pose that minimizes the photometric error.

First, the reconnection electric\nfield is often well above the runaway limit, implying that collisional\nresistivity is invalid. Furthermore, both theory and simulations suggest that\nplasmoid formation may rapidly induce a transition to kinetic scales, due to\nthe formation of thin current sheets.

However, most predicates\nonly occur a handful of times making them difficult to learn. We introduce the\nfirst scene graph prediction model that supports few-shot learning of\npredicates. Existing scene graph generation models represent objects using\npretrained object detectors or word embeddings that capture semantic object\ninformation at the cost of encoding information about which relationships they\nafford. So, these object representations are unable to generalize to new\nfew-shot relationships. We introduce a framework that induces object\nrepresentations that are structured according to their visual relationships.\nUnlike past methods, our framework embeds objects that afford similar\nrelationships closer together. This property allows our model to perform well\nin the few-shot setting. For example, applying the 'riding' predicate\ntransformation to 'person' modifies the representation towards objects like\n'skateboard' and 'horse' that enable riding.

For small piles, the\ngrains flow smoothly downhill, but after a critical pile size $X_c$, the flow\nbecomes intermittent: sudden avalanches slide downhill from the apex to the\nbase, followed by an \"uphill front\" that slowly climbs up, until a new downhill\navalanche interrupts the process. By means of experiments controlling the\ndistance between the apex of the sandpile and the container feeding it from\nabove, we show that $X_c$ grows linearly with the input flux, but scales as the\nsquare root of the feeding height. We explain these facts based on a\nphenomenological model based on the experimental observation that the flowing\ngranular phase forms a \"wedge\" on top of the static one, differently from the\ncase of stationary heaps.

A set of agents is feasible if\nthey form both an independent set in the matroid and an independent set in the\ngraph. Our main result is an ex-ante 1/(2d+2)-prophet inequality, where d is a\ngraph parameter upper-bounded by the maximum size of an independent set in the\nneighborhood of any vertex.\n  We establish this result through a framework that sets both dynamic prices\nfor elements in the matroid (using the method of balanced thresholds), and\nstatic but discriminatory prices for vertices in the graph (motivated by recent\ndevelopments in approximate dynamic programming). The threshold for accepting\nan agent is then the sum of these two prices.\n  We show that for graphs induced by a certain family of interval-scheduling\nconstraints, the value of d is 1. Our framework thus provides the first\nconstant-factor prophet inequality when there are both matroid-independence\nconstraints and interval-scheduling constraints. It also unifies and improves\nseveral results from the literature, leading to a 1/2-prophet inequality when\nagents have XOS valuation functions over a set of items and use them for a\nfinite interval duration, and more generally, a 1/(d+1)-prophet inequality when\nthese items each require a bundle of d resources to procure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 02:34:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 22:59:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

To create apps that behave\nas expected, developers must follow complex and often implicit asynchronous\nprogramming protocols. Such protocols intertwine the proper registering of\ncallbacks to receive control from the framework with appropriate\napplication-programming interface (API) calls that in turn affect the set of\npossible future callbacks. An app violates the protocol when, for example, it\ncalls a particular API method in a state of the framework where such a call is\ninvalid. What makes automated reasoning hard in this domain is largely what\nmakes programming apps against such frameworks hard: the specification of the\nprotocol is unclear, and the control flow is complex, asynchronous, and\nhigher-order. In this paper, we tackle the problem of specifying and modeling\nevent-driven application-programming protocols. In particular, we formalize a\ncore meta-model that captures the dialogue between event-driven frameworks and\napplication callbacks. Based on this meta-model, we define a language called\nlifestate that permits precise and formal descriptions of\napplication-programming protocols and the callback control flow imposed by the\nevent-driven framework. Lifestate unifies modeling what app callbacks can\nexpect of the framework with specifying rules the app must respect when calling\ninto the framework. In this way, we effectively combine lifecycle constraints\nand typestate rules. To evaluate the effectiveness of lifestate modeling, we\nprovide a dynamic verification algorithm that takes as input a trace of\nexecution of an app and a lifestate protocol specification to either produce a\ntrace witnessing a protocol violation or a proof that no such trace is\nrealizable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 03:36:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 01:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

The immutable nature of the blockchain makes it a winner on\nsecurity and transparency; it is nearly inconceivable for ledgers to be altered\nin a way not instantly clear to every single user involved. However, most\nblockchains fall short in privacy aspects, particularly in data protection.\nGarlic Routing and Onion Routing are two of major Privacy Enhancing Techniques\n(PETs) which are popular for anonymization and security.

The carrier is first reduced by a controlled amount (30-40 dB)\nby adding a reference signal of nearly equal amplitude and opposite in phase.\nThen, residual carrier and noise sidebands are amplified and sent to a\nconventional PN analyzer. The main virtues of our method are: (i) the noise\nspecs of the PN analyzer are relaxed by a factor equal to the carrier\nsuppression ratio; and, (ii) the capability to measure the AN using a PN\nanalyzer, with no need for the analyzer to feature AN measurement. An obvious\nvariant enables AN and PN measurements using an AN analyzer with no PN\nmeasurement capability. Such instrument is extremely simple and easy to\nimplement with a power-detector diode followed by a FFT analyzer. Unlike the\nclassical bridge (interferometric) method, there is no need for external line\nstretcher and variable attenuators because phase and amplitude control is\nimplemented in the device under test.

By summarizing the experimental results, we provide general\nguidelines for properly selecting graph embedding methods and setting their\nhyper-parameters for different biomedical tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 09:15:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2019 17:58:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 16:32:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-21"}

The airplane boarding problem is\nnaturally embedded in a 1+1 dimensional space-time with a flat Lorentzian\nmetric. The duration of the boarding process can be calculated based on a\nrepresentation of the one-dimensional queue of passengers attempting to reach\ntheir seats, into a two-dimensional space-time diagram. The ability of a\npassenger to delay other passengers depends on their queue positions and row\ndesignations. This is equivalent to the causal relationship between two events\nin space-time, whereas two passengers are time-like separated if one is\nblocking the other, and space-like if both can be seated simultaneously.\nGeodesics in this geometry can be utilized to compute the asymptotic boarding\ntime, since space-time geometry is the many-particle (passengers) limit of\nairplane boarding.\n  Our approach naturally leads to a novel definition of an effective refractive\nindex. The introduction of an effective refractive index enables, for the first\ntime, an analytical calculation of the average boarding time for groups of\npassengers with different aisle-clearing time distribution. In the past,\nairline companies attempted to shorten the boarding times by trying boarding\npolicies that either allow slow or fast passengers to board first. Our\nanalytical calculations, backed by discrete-event simulations, support the\ncounter-intuitive result that the total boarding time is shorter with the slow\npassengers boarding before the fast passengers. This is a universal result,\nvalid for any combination of the parameters that characterize the problem ---\npercentage of slow passengers, ratio between aisle-clearing times between the\nfast and the slow groups, and the density of passengers along the aisle. We\nfind an improvement of up to 28% compared with the Fast-First boarding policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 09:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

However, although the performance of recommendations is\ngreatly improved, the \"Matthew effect\" becomes increasingly evident. While the\nhead contents get more and more popular, many competitive long-tail contents\nare difficult to achieve timely exposure because of lacking behavior features.\nThis issue has badly impacted the quality and diversity of recommendations. To\nsolve this problem, look-alike algorithm is a good choice to extend audience\nfor high quality long-tail contents. But the traditional look-alike models\nwhich widely used in online advertising are not suitable for recommender\nsystems because of the strict requirement of both real-time and effectiveness.\nThis paper introduces a real-time attention based look-alike model (RALM) for\nrecommender systems, which tackles the challenge of conflict between real-time\nand effectiveness. RALM realizes real-time look-alike audience extension\nbenefiting from seeds-to-user similarity prediction and improves the\neffectiveness through optimizing user representation learning and look-alike\nlearning modeling. For user representation learning, we propose a novel neural\nnetwork structure named attention merge layer to replace the concatenation\nlayer, which significantly improves the expressive ability of multi-fields\nfeature learning. On the other hand, considering the various members of seeds,\nwe design global attention unit and local attention unit to learn robust and\nadaptive seeds representation with respect to a certain target user. At last,\nwe introduce seeds clustering mechanism which not only reduces the time\ncomplexity of attention units prediction but also minimizes the loss of seeds\ninformation at the same time.

Recently, mobile-edge\ncomputing (MEC) and unmanned aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs) have\nemerged as promising techniques in IoT. In this paper, we propose a three-layer\nonline data processing network based on MEC technique. On the bottom layer, raw\ndata are generated by widely distributed sensors, which reflects local\ninformation. Upon them, unmanned aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs) are\ndeployed as moving MEC servers, which collect data and conduct initial steps of\ndata processing. On top of them, a center cloud receives processed results and\nconducts further evaluation. As this is an online data processing system, the\nedge nodes should stabilize delay to ensure data freshness. Furthermore,\nlimited onboard energy poses constraints to edge processing capability. To\nsmartly manage network resources for saving energy and stabilizing delay, we\ndevelop an online determination policy based on Lyapunov Optimization. In cases\nof low data rate, it tends to reduce edge processor frequency for saving\nenergy. In the presence of high data rate, it will smartly allocate bandwidth\nfor edge data offloading. Meanwhile, hovering UAV-BSs bring a large and\nflexible service coverage, which results in the problem of effective path\nplanning. In this paper, we apply deep reinforcement learning and develop an\nonline path planning algorithm. Taking observations of around environment as\ninput, a CNN network is trained to predict the reward of each action. By\nsimulations, we validate its effectiveness in enhancing service coverage. The\nresult will contribute to big data processing in future IoT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 09:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-13"}

The induced fit and population shift models, which differ by the\nassumed number of stable configurations, explain such cooperative binding from\na thermodynamic viewpoint. Yet, understanding what mechanical principles\nconstrain these models remains a challenge. Here we provide an empirical study\non 34 proteins supporting the idea that allosteric conformational change\ngenerally occurs along a soft elastic mode presenting extended regions of high\nshear. We argue, based on a detailed analysis of how the energy profile along\nsuch a mode depends on binding, that in the induced fit scenario there is an\noptimal stiffness $k_a^*\\sim 1/N$ for cooperative binding, where $N$ is the\nnumber of residues involved in the allosteric response. We find that the\npopulation shift scenario is more robust to mutation affecting stiffness, as\nbinding becomes more and more cooperative with stiffness up to the same\ncharacteristic value $k_a^*$, beyond which cooperativity saturates instead of\ndecaying. We confirm numerically these findings in a non-linear mechanical\nmodel. Dynamical considerations suggest that a stiffness of order $k_a^*$ is\nfavorable in that scenario as well, supporting that for proper function\nproteins must evolve a functional elastic mode that is softer as their size\nincreases. In consistency with this view, we find a significant anticorrelation\nbetween the stiffness of the allosteric response and protein size in our data\nset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 10:10:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 14:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-28"}

Instead of the\ndirect analytic continuation of the correlation functions, the Pade method is\napplied for the self-energy that is then used for deriving the Green's\nfunctions at real energies. We find that this modified, self-energy Pade\napproach is more stable and robust against statistical errors compared to the\ndirect way. The characteristics and success of the modified Pade approach are\nanalyzed by actual calculations for the illustrative cases of the\nnon-interacting Anderson lattice and Hubbard model. A zero-gap Kondo lattice\nmodel with linearly vanishing conduction electron density of states at the\nFermi level is also studied, where we use the modified Pade approach as\nanalytic continuation. We investigate the properties of the Kondo insulating\nstate including the dependence of the insulating gap on the Kondo coupling and\ncoherence effects.

Agricultural\nmachinery operates in both indoor and outdoor farm environments, resulting in\nchanging operational conditions. Variation in the load transported by\nground-vehicles is a common occurrence in the agricultural domain, in tasks\nsuch as animal feeding and field spraying. The development of automated and\nrobotic ground-vehicle solutions for conditions and scenarios in the\nagricultural domain is a complex task, which requires input from multiple\nengineering disciplines. This PhD thesis proposes modelling and simulation for\nthe research and development of automated and robotic ground-vehicle solutions\nfor purposes such as component development, virtual prototype testing, and\nscenario evaluation. The collaboration of multiple engineering disciplines is\nachieved by combining multiple modelling and simulation tools from different\nengineering disciplines. These combined models are known as co-models and their\nexecution is referred to as co-simulation. The results of this thesis are a\nmodel-based development methodology for automated and robotic ground-vehicles\nutilised for a number of research and development cases. The co-models of the\nautomated and robotic ground vehicles were created using the model-based\ndevelopment methodology, and they contribute to the future development support\nin this research domain. The thesis presents four contributions toward the\nexploration of a chosen design space for an automated or robotic ground\nvehicle.

Working in this scenario, we show that the mass\nfunction of SMBH after such a limited time period with growing formation rate\npaired with super-Eddington accretion can be described as a broken power-law\nwith two characteristic features. There is a power-law at intermediate masses\nwhose index is the dimensionless ratio {\\alpha} = {\\lambda}/{\\gamma}, where\n{\\lambda} is the growth rate of the number of DCBH during their formation era,\nand {\\gamma} is the growth rate of DCBH masses by super-Eddington accretion\nduring the DCBH growth era. A second feature is a break in the power law\nprofile at high masses, above which the mass function declines rapidly. The\nlocation of the break is related to the dimensionless number \\b{eta} = {\\gamma}\nT, where T is the duration of the period of DCBH growth.

Lately, social tagging systems, in which users can insert new contents,\ntag, organize, share, and search for contents are becoming more popular.

These\nreal-world graphs are often substantially more structured than a generic\nvertex-and-edge model would suggest, but this insight has remained mostly\nunexplored by existing graph engines for graph query optimization purposes.\nTherefore, in this work, we focus on leveraging structural properties of graphs\nand queries to automatically derive materialized graph views that can\ndramatically speed up query evaluation. We present KASKADE, the first graph\nquery optimization framework to exploit materialized graph views for query\noptimization purposes. KASKADE employs a novel constraint-based view\nenumeration technique that mines constraints from query workloads and graph\nschemas, and injects them during view enumeration to significantly reduce the\nsearch space of views to be considered. Moreover, it introduces a graph view\nsize estimator to pick the most beneficial views to materialize given a query\nset and to select the best query evaluation plan given a set of materialized\nviews. We evaluate its performance over real-world graphs, including the\nprovenance graph that we maintain at Microsoft to enable auditing, service\nanalytics, and advanced system optimizations.

Our\nsolutions show growth rates considerably stronger than those of the earlier\ntreatments, which were mostly Newtonian. On scales near and beyond the Hubble\nradius, namely at the long-wavelength limit, peculiar velocities are found to\ngrow as $a^2$, in terms of the scale factor, instead of the Newtonian\n$a^{1/2}$-law. We attribute this to the fact that, in general relativity, the\nenergy flux, triggered here by the peculiar motion of the matter, also\ncontributes to the local gravitational field. In a sense, the bulk flow\ngravitates, an effect that has been bypassed in related relativistic studies.\nThese stronger growth-rates imply faster peculiar velocities at horizon\ncrossing and higher residual values for the peculiar-velocity field.\nAlternatively, one could say that our study favours bulk peculiar flows larger\nand faster than anticipated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 14:25:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 17:20:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 14:57:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 12:23:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

However, very few research works have focused on\nevaluating the perceptual visual quality of omnidirectional images, especially\nfor stereoscopic omnidirectional images. In this paper, based on the predictive\ncoding theory of the human vision system (HVS), we propose a stereoscopic\nomnidirectional image quality evaluator (SOIQE) to cope with the\ncharacteristics of 3D 360-degree images. Two modules are involved in SOIQE:\npredictive coding theory based binocular rivalry module and multi-view fusion\nmodule. In the binocular rivalry module, we introduce predictive coding theory\nto simulate the competition between high-level patterns and calculate the\nsimilarity and rivalry dominance to obtain the quality scores of viewport\nimages. Moreover, we develop the multi-view fusion module to aggregate the\nquality scores of viewport images with the help of both content weight and\nlocation weight. The proposed SOIQE is a parametric model without necessary of\nregression learning, which ensures its interpretability and generalization\nperformance. Experimental results on our published stereoscopic omnidirectional\nimage quality assessment database (SOLID) demonstrate that our proposed SOIQE\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art metrics.

In this\npaper, we consider using a swarm of UAVs as amplify-and-forward MIMO relays to\nprovide connectivity between an obstructed multi-antenna equipped source and\ndestination. We start by optimizing UAV placement for the single antenna case,\nand analyze its dependence on the noise introduced by the relay, its gain, and\ntransmit power constraint. We extend our analysis for an arbitrary UAV swarm\nand show how the MIMO link capacity can be optimized by changing the distance\nof the swarm to the source and the destination. Then, we consider the effect of\noptimizing the positions of the UAVs within the swarm and derive an upper bound\nfor the capacity at any given placement of the swarm.

The most spectacular of such phenomena are pulsar\nglitches, sudden spin-ups observed in many pulsars. A background flow of a\nnormal-fluid component with respect to the superfluid is also known to lead to\na number of instabilities in laboratory superfluids, possibly leading to\nturbulence and modifying the nature of the mutual friction coupling between the\ntwo fluids. In this paper we consider modes of oscillation in the crust and\ncore of a superfluid neutron star, by conducting a plane-wave analysis. We\nexplicitly account for a background flow between the two components (as would\nbe expected in the presence of pinning) and the entrainment, and we consider\nboth standard (Hall-Vinen) and isotropic (Gorter-Mellink) forms of the mutual\nfriction. We find that for standard mutual friction there are families of\nunstable inertial and sound waves both in the case of a counter-flow along the\nsuperfluid vortex axis and for counterflow perpendicular to the vortex axis and\nfind that entrainment leads to a quantitative difference between instabilities\nin the crust and core of the star. For isotropic mutual friction we find no\nunstable modes, and speculate that instabilities in a straight vortex array may\nbe linked to glitching behaviour, which then ceases until the turbulence has\ndecayed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 14:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

As a result, PSP maintains\nprediction performance, creates a substantial amount of sparsity that is\nstructured and, thus, easy and efficient to map to a variety of massively\nparallel processors, which are mandatory for utmost compute power and energy\nefficiency.

Based on the weak-friction model, we derive expressions of the\nresulting forces and torques considering complete tidal interactions between\nall the bodies of the system. Although the tidal deformation suffered by each\nextended mass must take into account the combined gravitational effects of the\nother two bodies, the only tidal forces that have a net effect on the dynamic\nare those that are applied on the same body that exerts the deformation, as\nlong as no mean-motion resonance exists between the masses. We apply the model\nto the Kepler-38 binary system. The evolution of the spin equations shows that\nthe planet reaches a stationary solution much faster than the stars, and the\nequilibrium spin frequency is sub-synchronous. The binary components evolve on\na longer timescale, reaching a super-synchronous solution very close to that\nderived for the 2-body problem. After reaching spin stationarity, the\neccentricity is damped in all bodies and for all the parameters analyzed here.\nA similar effect is noted for the binary separation. The semimajor axis of the\nplanet, on the other hand, may migrate inwards or outwards, depending on the\nmasses and orbital parameters. In some cases the secular evolution of the\nsystem may also exhibit an alignment of the pericenters, requiring to include\nadditional terms in the tidal model. Finally, we derived analytical expressions\nfor the variational equations of the orbital evolution and spin rates based on\nlow-order elliptical expansions in the semimajor axis ratio and the\neccentricities. These are found to reduce to the 2-body case when one of the\nmasses is taken equal to zero.

Most methods in this space assume, however, the\nknowledge of task boundaries, and focus on alleviating catastrophic forgetting.\nIn this work, we depart from this view and move the focus towards faster\nremembering -- i.e measuring how quickly the network recovers performance\nrather than measuring the network's performance without any adaptation.

Detecting\nanomalies, or irregular and rare events, in time series data, can enable us to\nfind abnormal events in any natural phenomena, which may require special\ntreatment. Moreover, labeled instances of anomaly are hard to get in time\nseries data. On the other hand, time series data, due to its nature, often\nexhibits localized expansions and compressions in the time dimension which is\ncalled warping.

When the Knudsen\nnumber is large, i.e. the system is highly rarefied, the conventional iteration\nscheme can lead to convergence within a few iterations. However, when the\nKnudsen number is small, i.e. the flow falls in the near-continuum regime,\nhundreds of thousands iterations are needed, and yet the \"converged\" solutions\nare prone to be contaminated by accumulated error and large numerical\ndissipation. Recently, based on the gas kinetic models, the implicit unified\ngas kinetic scheme (UGKS) and its variants have significantly reduced the\niterations in the near-continuum flow regime, but still much higher than that\nof the highly rarefied gas flows. In this paper, we put forward a general\nsynthetic iteration scheme (GSIS) to find the steady-state solutions of general\nrarefied gas flows within dozens of iterations at any Knudsen number. As the\nGSIS does not rely on the specific kinetic model/collision operator, it can be\nnaturally extended to quickly find converged solutions for mixture flows and\neven flows involving chemical reactions.

A\nnovel adversarial training framework is formulated to learn an anonymization\ntransform for input videos such that the trade-off between target utility task\nperformance and the associated privacy budgets is explicitly optimized on the\nanonymized videos. Notably, the privacy budget, often defined and measured in\ntask-driven contexts, cannot be reliably indicated using any single model\nperformance because strong protection of privacy should sustain against any\nmalicious model that tries to steal private information.
