Ground-based imagery offers\na convenient data source for satellite characterization; however, analysis\nalgorithms must contend with atmospheric distortion, variable lighting, and\nunknown reflectance properties. Traditional feature-based pose estimation\napproaches are unable to discover an accurate correlation between a known 3D\nmodel and imagery given this challenging image environment. This paper presents\nan innovative method for automated 3D pose estimation of known space objects in\nthe absence of satisfactory texture. The proposed approach fits the silhouette\nof a known satellite model to ground-based imagery via particle filtering. Each\nparticle contains enough information (orientation, position, scale, model\narticulation) to generate an accurate object silhouette. The silhouette of\nindividual particles is compared to an observed image. Comparison is done\nprobabilistically by calculating the joint probability that pixels inside the\nsilhouette belong to the foreground distribution and that pixels outside the\nsilhouette belong to the background distribution. Both foreground and\nbackground distributions are computed by observing empty space. The population\nof particles are resampled at each new image observation, with the probability\nof a particle being resampled proportional to how the particle's silhouette\nmatches the observation image. The resampling process maintains multiple pose\nestimates which is beneficial in preventing and escaping local minimums.\nExperiments were conducted on both commercial imagery and on LEO satellite\nimagery. Imagery from the commercial experiments are shown in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 16:02:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-27"}

Aging processes are ubiquitous and play a fundamental role in the\nphysics of glasses and spin glasses and in other applications (e.g. in\nalgorithms minimizing complex cost/loss functions). The theory of aging in the\nout of equilibrium dynamics of mean-field spin glass models has achieved a\nfundamental role, thanks to the asymptotic analytic solution found by\nCugliandolo and Kurchan. However this solution is based on assumptions (e.g.\nthe weak ergodicity breaking hypothesis) which have never been put under a\nstrong test until now. In the present work we present the results of an\nextraordinary large set of numerical simulations of the prototypical mean-field\nspin glass models, namely the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick and the Viana-Bray\nmodels. Thanks to a very intensive use of GPUs, we have been able to run the\nlatter model for more than $2^{64}$ spin updates and thus safely extrapolate\nthe numerical data both in the thermodynamical limit and in the large times\nlimit. The measurements of the two-times correlation functions in isothermal\naging after a quench from a random initial configuration to a temperature\n$T<T_c$ provides clear evidence that, at large times, such correlations do not\ndecay to zero as expected by assuming weak ergodicity breaking. We conclude\nthat strong ergodicity breaking takes place in mean-field spin glasses aging\ndynamics which, asymptotically, takes place in a confined configurational\nspace. Theoretical models for the aging dynamics need to be revised\naccordingly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 16:29:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-04"}

The mixing between the light and matter characters\nmodifies the photophysical and photochemical properties. Especially, it was\nreported that these polaritons can be employed to control photochemical\nreactions, charge and energy transfer, and other processes. In addition,\naccording to recent studies, vibrational strong coupling can be employed to\nresonantly enhance the thermally-activated chemical reactions. In this work, a\ntheoretical model and an efficient numerical method for studying the dynamics\nof molecules strongly interacting with quantum light are developed based on\nnon-adiabatic excited-state molecular dynamics. The methodology was employed to\nstudy the \\textit{cis-trans} photoisomerization of a realistic molecule in a\ncavity. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the photochemical reactions can\nbe controlled by tuning the properties of the cavity. In the calculated\nexample, the isomerization is suppressed when polaritonic states develop a\nlocal minimum on the lower polaritonic state. Moreover, the observed reduction\nof isomerization is tunable via the photon energy and light-molecule coupling\nstrength. But the fluctuation in transition dipole screens the effect of\nlight-matter, which makes it harder to tune the photochemical properties via\nthe coupling strength. These insights suggest quantum control of photochemical\nreactions is possible by specially designed photonic or plasmonic cavities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 17:01:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 21:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

As a result, we obtain several models with similar\n$\\chi^2$ values as the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. When we allow for a\nredshift-dependence of the SNIa intrinsic luminosity, a model with a $G$\nexponentially decreasing to zero while remaining positive (model 4) can explain\nthe observations without acceleration.

By utilizing morphological information about\nthe flux of real astronomical sources during object detection, Morpheus shows\nresiliency to false-positive identifications of sources.

Appropriately\nusing covariates further yields more precise estimators in randomized\nexperiments. R. A. Fisher suggested blocking on discrete covariates in the\ndesign stage or conducting analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in the analysis\nstage. We can embed blocking into a wider class of experimental design called\nrerandomization, and extend the classical ANCOVA to more general regression\nadjustment. Rerandomization trumps complete randomization in the design stage,\nand regression adjustment trumps the simple difference-in-means estimator in\nthe analysis stage. It is then intuitive to use both rerandomization and\nregression adjustment. Under the randomization-inference framework, we\nestablish a unified theory allowing the designer and analyzer to have access to\ndifferent sets of covariates. We find that asymptotically (a) for any given\nestimator with or without regression adjustment, rerandomization never hurts\neither the sampling precision or the estimated precision, and (b) for any given\ndesign with or without rerandomization, our regression-adjusted estimator never\nhurts the estimated precision. Therefore, combining rerandomization and\nregression adjustment yields better coverage properties and thus improves\nstatistical inference. To theoretically quantify these statements, we discuss\noptimal regression-adjusted estimators in terms of the sampling precision and\nthe estimated precision, and then measure the additional gains of the designer\nand the analyzer.

We investigate\nearly-time neutron-star mergers as the mechanism for this enrichment. Through\nboth numerical modeling and analytical arguments, we show that neutron-star\nmergers cannot be induced through dynamical interactions early in the history\nof the cluster, even when the most liberal assumptions about neutron-star\nsegregation are assumed. Therefore, if neutron-star mergers are the primary\nmechanism for r-process dispersion in globular clusters, they likely result\nfrom the evolution of isolated, primordial binaries in the clusters. Through\npopulation modeling, we find that moderate fractions of GCs with enrichment are\nonly possible when a significant number of double neutron-star progenitors\nproceed through Case BB mass transfer --- under various assumptions for the\ninitial properties of globular clusters, a neutron-star merger with the\npotential for enrichment will occur in ~15-60% (~30-90%) of globular clusters\nif this mass transfer proceeds stably (unstably). The strong anti-correlation\nbetween the pre-supernova orbital separation and post-supernova systemic\nvelocity due to mass loss in the supernova leads to efficient ejection of most\nenrichment candidates from their host clusters.

Many strategies have been developed to reveal structural or\ndynamical information about chiral molecules, from the microwave to the extreme\nultraviolet range. Most schemes employ circularly or elliptically polarized\nradiation, and more sophisticated configurations involve, for instance, light\npulses with time-varying polarization states. In all these schemes, the\npolarization state of light is always considered as constant over one optical\ncycle. In this study, we zoom into the optical cycle in order to resolve and\ncontrol a subcyle attosecond chiroptical process. We engineer an electric field\nwhose instantaneous chirality can be controlled within the optical cycle, by\ncombining two phase-locked orthogonally polarized fundamental and second\nharmonic fields. While the composite field has zero net ellipticity, it shows\nan instantaneous optical chirality which can be controlled via the two-color\ndelay. We theoretically and experimentally investigate the photoionization of\nchiral molecules with this controlled chiral field. We find that electrons are\npreferentially ejected forward or backward relative to the laser propagation\ndirection depending on the molecular handedness, similarly to the\nwell-established photoelectron circular dichroism process. However, since the\ninstantaneous chirality switches sign from one half cycle to the next,\nelectrons ionized from two consecutive half cycles of the laser show opposite\nforward/backward asymmetries.

In the outer solar system, the best place\nto look for clues is the Kuiper belt, where icy planetesimals survived to this\nday. Here we report evidence that Kuiper belt planetesimals formed by the\nstreaming instability, a process in which aerodynamically concentrated clumps\nof pebbles gravitationally collapse into 100-km-class bodies.

Results: Four factors were identified:\nFactor A groups undecided researchers that need more evidence before using RRs;\nResearchers grouped in Factor B are generally positive about RRs, but highlight\nthe need to define minimum standards; Factor C researchers are more skeptical\nand reinforce the importance of high quality evidence; Researchers aligned to\nFactor D have a pragmatic point of view, considering RRs can be applied based\non the context and constraints faced by practitioners. Conclusions: In\nconclusion, although there are opposing viewpoints, there are also some common\ngrounds. For example, all viewpoints agree that both RRs and Systematic Reviews\ncan be poorly or well conducted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 21:08:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-28"}

Previous research\non the desorption of molecules from the ice mantle assumed that grains are at\nrest which is contrary to the fact that grains are suprathermally rotating as a\nresult of their interaction with an anisotropic radiation or gas flow. {To\nclearly understand how molecules are released in to the gas phase, the effect\nof grain suprathermal rotation on surface chemistry must be quantified}. In\nthis paper, we study the effect of suprathermal rotation of dust grains spun-up\nby radiative torques on the desorption of molecules from icy grain mantles\naround protostars.

In practice, however, they contain errors despite all efforts\nto minimise them. These errors then propagate up to the accuracy assessment\nstage and impact the validation results. For photo-interpreted reference data,\nthe three most widely studied sources of error are systematic incorrect\nlabelling, vigilance drops, and demographic factors. How internal estimation\nerrors, i.e., errors intrinsic to the response design, affect the accuracy of\nreference data is far less understood. We analysed the impact of estimation\nerrors for two types of legends as well as for point-based and partition-based\nresponse designs with a range of sub-sample sizes. We showed that the accuracy\nof response designs depends on the class proportions within the sampling units,\nwith complex landscapes being more prone to errors. As a result, response\ndesigns where the number of sub-samples are fixed are inefficient, and the\nlabels of reference data sets have inconsistent confidence levels. To control\nestimation errors, to guarantee high accuracy standards of validation data, and\nto minimise data collection efforts, we proposed to rely on confidence\nintervals of the photo-interpreted data to define how many sub-samples should\nbe labelled. In practice, sub-samples are iteratively selected and labelled\nuntil the estimated class proportions reach the desired level of confidence. As\na result, less effort is spent on labelling obvious cases and the spared effort\ncan be allocated to more complex cases. This approach could reduce the\nlabelling effort by 50% to 75% in our study site, with greater gains in\nhomogeneous landscapes. We contend that adopting this optimisation approach\nwill not only increase the efficiency of reference data collection but will\nalso help deliver reliable accuracy estimates to the user community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 00:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

Design of the RLC circuit was\nperformed in electrical circuit modelling software, aided by in vitro impedance\nmeasurements on nerve and nerve cuff in the range 5 Hz to 50 kHz. Main results:\nThe frequency range 17 +/- 1 kHz was selected for the RLC experiment.

Since the view of each user is\nlimited, it is unnecessary to send the whole 360-degree scene at high quality\nwhich can be a heavy burden for the transmission system. Assuming filed-of-view\n(FoV) of each user can be predicted with high probability, we can divide the\nvideo screen into partitions and send those partitions which will appear in FoV\nat high quality. Hence, we propose an novel strategy for VR video streaming.\nFirst, we define a quality-of-experience metric to measure the viewing\nexperience of users and define a channel model to reflect the fluctuation of\nthe wireless channel. Next, we formulate the optimization problem and find its\nfeasible solution by convex optimization. In order to improve bandwidth\nefficiency, we also add adaptive modulation to this part. Finally, we compare\nour algorithm with other VR streaming algorithm in the simulation. It turns out\nthat our algorithm outperforms other algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 00:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-28"}

A total of 186 GRBs are found; of these,\n91 show emission in the range $30-100\\,$MeV (17 of which are seen only in this\nband) and 169 are detected above 100 MeV. Most of these sources were discovered\nby other instruments ($Fermi$/GBM, $Swift$/BAT, AGILE, INTEGRAL) or reported by\nthe Interplanetary Network (IPN); the LAT has independently triggered on 4\nGRBs. This catalog presents the results for all 186 GRBs. We study onset,\nduration and temporal properties of each GRB, as well as spectral\ncharacteristics in the $100\\,$MeV$-100\\,$GeV energy range. Particular attention\nis given to the photons with highest energy. Compared with the first LAT GRB\ncatalog, our rate of detection is significantly improved. The results generally\nconfirm the main findings of the first catalog: the LAT primarily detects the\nbrightest GBM bursts, and the high-energy emission shows delayed onset as well\nas longer duration. However, in this work we find delays exceeding 1 ks, and\nseveral GRBs with durations over 10 ks. Furthermore, the larger number of LAT\ndetections shows that these GRBs cover not only the high-fluence range of\nGBM-detected GRBs, but also samples lower fluences. In addition, the greater\nnumber of detected GRBs with redshift estimates allows us to study their\nproperties in both the observer and rest frames.

The most\npopular single-shot interferogram analysis method involves Fourier filtering of\ncross-term but this method suffers from poor resolution. For obtaining full\npixel resolution, it is necessary to model the object wave recovery as an\noptimization problem. The optimization approach typically involves minimizing a\ncost function consisting of a data consistency term and one or more constraint\nterms. Despite its potential performance advantages, this method is not used\nwidely due to several tedious and difficult tasks such as empirical tuning of\nfree parameters. We introduce a new optimization approach Mean gradient descent\n(MGD) for single-shot interferogram analysis that is simple to implement,\nrobust and does not require any free parameters. The MGD iteration does not try\nto achieve minimization of any cost function but instead aims to reach a\nsolution point where the data consistency and the constraint terms balance each\nother. This is achieved by iteratively progressing the solution in the\ndirection that bisects the descent directions associated with the error and\nconstraint terms. Numerical illustrations are shown for recovery of a step\nphase object from its corresponding off-axis as well as on-axis interferograms\nsimulated with multiple noise levels.

In this paper, therefore, a generalized Dempster-Shafer evidence theory\nis proposed. To be specific, a mass function in the generalized Dempster-Shafer\nevidence theory is modeled by a complex number, called as a complex basic\nbelief assignment, which has more powerful ability to express uncertain\ninformation. Based on that, a generalized Dempster's combination rule is\nexploited.

One of the critical\nconsiderations for designing, training or calibrating visual localization\nsystems is the coverage of the visual sensors equipped on the platforms. In an\naerial context for example, the altitude of the platform and camera field of\nview plays a critical role in how much of the environment a downward facing\ncamera can perceive at any one time. Furthermore, in other applications, such\nas on roads or in indoor environments, additional factors such as camera\nresolution and sensor placement altitude can also affect this coverage. The\nsensor coverage and the subsequent processing of its data also has significant\ncomputational implications. In this paper we present for the first time a set\nof methods for automatically determining the trade-off between coverage and\nvisual localization performance, enabling the identification of the minimum\nvisual sensor coverage required to obtain optimal localization performance with\nminimal compute. We develop a localization performance indicator based on the\noverlapping coefficient, and demonstrate its predictive power for localization\nperformance with a certain sensor coverage. We evaluate our method on several\nchallenging real-world datasets from aerial and ground-based domains, and\ndemonstrate that our method is able to automatically optimize for coverage\nusing a small amount of calibration data. We hope these results will assist in\nthe design of localization systems for future autonomous robot, vehicle and\nflying systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 03:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-28"}

Some\nresearch works have attempted to use extra information such as a depth map to\nhelp RGB based semantic segmentation because the depth map could provide\ncomplementary geometric cues. However, due to the inaccessibility of depth\nsensors, depth information is usually unavailable for the test images. In this\npaper, we leverage only the depth of training images as the privileged\ninformation to mine the hard pixels in semantic segmentation, in which depth\ninformation is only available for training images but not available for test\nimages. Specifically, we propose a novel Loss Weight Module, which outputs a\nloss weight map by employing two depth-related measurements of hard pixels:\nDepth Prediction Error and Depthaware Segmentation Error. The loss weight map\nis then applied to segmentation loss, with the goal of learning a more robust\nmodel by paying more attention to the hard pixels. Besides, we also explore a\ncurriculum learning strategy based on the loss weight map. Meanwhile, to fully\nmine the hard pixels on different scales, we apply our loss weight module to\nmulti-scale side outputs. Our hard pixels mining method achieves the\nstate-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets, and even outperforms the\nmethods which need depth input during testing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 05:01:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Sep 2019 09:26:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 01:49:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 07:37:01 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 01:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-12"}

We detected a dense molecular clump that contains FIR 4/5.\nWe also detected in $^{13}$CO blueshifted and redshifted components driven\npresumably by protostellar outflows in this region. The axes of the FIR 3 and\nVLA 13 outflows, projected on the plane of the sky, appear to point toward the\nFIR 4 clump, suggesting that the clump may be compressed by protostellar\noutflows from Class I sources, FIR 3 and VLA 13. Applying the hyperfine fit of\nN$_2$H$^+$ lines, we estimated the excitation temperature to be $\\sim$ 20 K.\nThe high excitation temperature is consistent with the fact that the clump\ncontains protostars. The CCS emission was detected in this region for the first\ntime. Its abundance is estimated to be a few $\\times 10^{-12}$, indicating that\nthe region is chemically evolved at $\\sim 10^5$ years, which is comparable to\nthe typical lifetime of the Class I protostars. This timescale is consistent\nwith the scenario that star formation in FIR 4 is triggered by dynamical\ncompression of the protostellar outflows.

To find help, programmers often take to\nonline question-and-answer forums such as Stack Overflow to start discussion\nthreads about the errors they encountered.\n  Aims: We conjecture that information from Stack Overflow threads which\ndiscuss compiler errors can be automatically collected and repackaged to\nprovide programmers with enhanced compiler error messages, thus saving\nprogrammers' time and energy.\n  Method: We present Pycee, a plugin integrated with the popular Sublime Text\nIDE to provide enhanced compiler error messages for the Python programming\nlanguage. Pycee automatically queries Stack Overflow to provide customised and\nsummarised information within the IDE. We evaluated two Pycee variants through\na think-aloud user study during which 16 programmers completed Python\nprogramming tasks while using Pycee.\n  Results: The majority of participants agreed that Pycee was helpful while\ncompleting the study tasks. When compared to a baseline relying on the official\nPython documentation to enhance compiler error messages, participants generally\npreferred Pycee in terms of helpfulness, citing concrete suggestions for fixes\nand example code as major benefits.\n  Conclusions: Our results confirm that data from online sources such as Stack\nOverflow can be successfully used to automatically enhance compiler error\nmessages. Our work opens up venues for future work to further enhance compiler\nerror messages as well as to automatically reuse content from Stack Overflow\nfor other aspects of programming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 06:41:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-28"}

Change detection in multi-temporal VHR images\nplays a significant role in urban expansion and area internal change analysis.\nNevertheless, traditional change detection methods can neither take full\nadvantage of spatial context information nor cope with the complex internal\nheterogeneity of VHR images. In this paper, a powerful feature extraction model\nentitled multi-scale feature convolution unit (MFCU) is adopted for change\ndetection in multi-temporal VHR images. MFCU can extract multi-scale\nspatial-spectral features in the same layer. Based on the unit two novel deep\nsiamese convolutional neural networks, called as deep siamese multi-scale\nconvolutional network (DSMS-CN) and deep siamese multi-scale fully\nconvolutional network (DSMS-FCN), are designed for unsupervised and supervised\nchange detection, respectively. For unsupervised change detection, an automatic\npre-classification is implemented to obtain reliable training samples, then\nDSMS-CN fits the statistical distribution of changed and unchanged areas from\nselected training samples through MFCU modules and deep siamese architecture.\nFor supervised change detection, the end-to-end deep fully convolutional\nnetwork DSMS-FCN is trained in any size of multi-temporal VHR images, and\ndirectly outputs the binary change map. In addition, for the purpose of solving\nthe inaccurate localization problem, the fully connected conditional random\nfield (FC-CRF) is combined with DSMS-FCN to refine the results.

One interpretation is that these\nrings are caused by growing planets. These potential planets are not yet\nopening very deep gaps in their discs. These planets instead form small gaps in\nthe discs to generate small pressure bumps exterior to their orbits that stop\nthe inflow of the largest dust particles. In the pebble accretion paradigm,\nthis planetary mass corresponds to the pebble isolation mass, where pebble\naccretion stops and efficient gas accretion starts. We perform planet\npopulation synthesis via pebble and gas accretion including type-I and type-II\nmigration. In the first stage of our simulations, we investigate the conditions\nnecessary for planets to reach the pebble isolation mass and compare their\nposition to the observed gaps. We find that in order to match the gap\nstructures 2000 M E in pebbles is needed, which would be only available for the\nmost metal rich stars.

Recently, Hoang et al. proposed that the increase in the abundance of\nsmall grains relative to large grains near SNe Ia due to RAdiative Torque\nDisruption (RATD) can explain this puzzle. To test this scenario, we will\nperform detailed modeling of dust extinction and polarization of SNe Ia\naccounting for grain disruption by RATD and grain alignment by RAdiative\nTorques (RATs). For dust clouds at distance $d< 4$ pc from the source, we find\nthat $R_{\\rm V}$ decreases rapidly from the standard value of $3.1$ to $\\sim\n1.5$ after a disruption time $t_{\\rm disr}\\le 40$ days. We then calculate the\nobserved SNe Ia light curve and find that the colors of SNe Ia would change\nwith time due to time-varying extinction for dust clouds at distance of $d<4$\npc. We also calculate the wavelength-dependence polarization produced by grains\naligned with the magnetic fields by RATs. We find that $ \\lambda_{\\rm max}$\ndecreases rapidly from $\\sim 0.55 \\mu$m to $\\sim 0.15 \\mu$m over an alignment\ntime of $t_{\\rm align}< 10$ days due to the enhanced alignment of small grains.\nBy fitting the theoretical polarization curve with the Serkowski law, we find\nthat the parameter $K$ from the Serkowski law increases when large grains are\ndisrupted by RATD which can explain the $K$ vs. $\\lambda_{\\rm max}$ data\nobserved for SNe Ia. Finally, we discover an anti-correlation between $K$ and\n$R_{\\rm V}$ which might already be supported by SNe Ia observational data. Our\nresults demonstrate the important effect of rotational disruption of dust\ngrains by radiative torques on the time-dependent extinction, polarization, and\ncolors of SNe Ia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 08:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-28"}

Such correlation\ncomes from the fact that the low-dimensionality of the electronic structure,\nwhich enhances the density of states near the band edge, strongly depends on\nthe pnictogen atom through, e.g., the strength of the spin-orbit coupling.\nMoreover, hybridization of the wave functions in the pnictogen-dichalcogenide\nlayer and those in the rock-salt layer plays a key role in gap opening, and\nthus is important for achieving high thermoelectric performance. In\nLaOSbPbSe$_3$, such hybridization also pushes up the conduction band bottom,\nwhich enhances the density of states near the band edge and thus the power\nfactor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 08:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

Dynamic analysis, which is particularly\npopular for languages such as JavaScript, faces the question whether to invest\nin analyzing flows caused by not executing a particular branch, so-called\nhidden implicit flows. This paper addresses the questions how common different\nkinds of flows are in real-world programs, how important these flows are to\nenforce security policies, and how costly it is to consider these flows. We\naddress these questions in an empirical study that analyzes 56 real-world\nJavaScript programs that suffer from various security problems, such as code\ninjection vulnerabilities, denial of service vulnerabilities, memory leaks, and\nprivacy leaks. The study is based on a state-of-the-art dynamic information\nflow analysis and a formalization of its core.

In contrast, we do not find any evidence that\ntracking hidden implicit flows reveals otherwise missed security problems.

It has been found that adaptation methods using\ndiscriminative objective functions - such as cross-entropy loss - often require\ncareful regularisation to avoid over-fitting to errors in the one-best\ntranscriptions. In this paper we solve this problem by performing\ndiscriminative adaptation using lattices obtained from a first pass decoding,\nan approach that can be readily integrated into the lattice-free maximum mutual\ninformation (LF-MMI) framework. We investigate this approach on three\ntranscription tasks of varying difficulty: TED talks, multi-genre broadcast\n(MGB) and a low-resource language (Somali). We find that our proposed approach\nenables many more parameters to be adapted without over-fitting being observed,\nand is successful even when the initial transcription has a WER in excess of\n50%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 09:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-28"}

More recently, methods have been introduced\nthat build a so-called surrogate model that predicts the validation loss for a\nspecific hyperparameter setting, model and dataset and then sequentially select\nthe next hyperparameter to test, based on a heuristic function of the expected\nvalue and the uncertainty of the surrogate model called acquisition function\n(sequential model-based Bayesian optimization, SMBO).\n  In this paper we model the hyperparameter optimization problem as a\nsequential decision problem, which hyperparameter to test next, and address it\nwith reinforcement learning. This way our model does not have to rely on a\nheuristic acquisition function like SMBO, but can learn which hyperparameters\nto test next based on the subsequent reduction in validation loss they will\neventually lead to, either because they yield good models themselves or because\nthey allow the hyperparameter selection policy to build a better surrogate\nmodel that is able to choose better hyperparameters later on.

A general\nframework for understanding and interpreting frictional rupture commonly\ninvolves an analogy to ordinary crack propagation, with far-reaching\nimplications for various disciplines, from engineering tribology to geophysics.\nAn important feature of the analogy to cracks is the existence of a reduction\nin the stress-bearing capacity of the ruptured interface, i.e. of a drop from\nthe applied stress, realized far ahead of a propagating rupture, to the\nresidual stress left behind it. Yet, how and under what conditions such finite\nand well-defined stress drops emerge from basic physics are not well\nunderstood. Here we show that for rapid rupture a stress drop is directly\nrelated to wave radiation from the frictional interface to the bodies\nsurrounding it and to long-range bulk elastodynamics, and not exclusively to\nthe physics of the contact interface. Furthermore, we show that the emergence\nof a stress drop is a transient effect, affected by the wave travel time in\nfinite systems and by the decay of long-range elastic interactions. Finally, we\nsupplement our results for rapid rupture with predictions for slow rupture. All\nof the theoretical predictions are supported by available experimental data and\nby extensive computations.

In patrolling, mobile robots repeatedly travel through an environment,\ncapture sensor data at certain sensing locations and deliver this data to the\nbase station in a way that maximizes the changes of detection. Robots move on\ntours, exchange data when they meet with robots on neighboring tours and so\neventually deliver data to the base station.\n  In this paper we jointly consider two important optimization criteria of\nmulti-robot patrolling: (i) idleness, i.e. the time between consecutive visits\nof sensing locations, and (ii) delay, i.e. the time between capturing data at\nthe sensing location and its arrival at the base station. We systematically\ninvestigate the effect of the robots' moving directions along their tours and\nthe selection of meeting points for data exchange. We prove that the problem of\ndetermining the movement directions and meeting points such that the data delay\nis minimized is NP-hard. We propose heuristics and provide a simulation study\nwhich shows that the cooperative approach can outperform an uncooperative\napproach where every robot delivers the captured data individually to the base\nstation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 10:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

Multiple scenarios and use cases\nwill highly benefit from such technology such as (i) offloading terrestrial\nbase stations (BSs) in dense and urban areas, and (ii) providing coverage for\nrural areas. However, one of the main challenges facing the deployment of\nairborne BSs is the limited available energy at the drone, which limits the\nflight time. In fact, most of the currently used unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAVs) can only operate for one hour maximum. This limits the performance of\nthe UAV-enabled cellular network due to the need to frequently visit the ground\nstation to recharge, leaving the UAV's coverage area temporarily out of\nservice. In this article, we propose a new UAV-enabled cellular network setup\nbased on tethered UAVs (TUAVs). In the proposed setup, the TUAV is connected to\na ground station (GS) through a tether, which provides the TUAV with both\nenergy and data. This enables a flight that can stay for days. We describe in\ndetail the components of the proposed system. Furthermore, we enlist the main\nadvantages of a TUAV-enabled cellular network compared to typical untethered\nUAVs. Next, we discuss the potential applications and use cases for TUAVs.\nFinally, we discuss the challenges, design considerations, and future research\ndirections to realize the proposed setup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 11:35:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 21:11:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-14"}

We find only undergraduate GPA to have a\nstatistically significant association with physics PhD completion across all\nmodels studied.

Here,\nwe propose a method of chip-based 3D nanoscopy through large and tunable\nspatial-frequency-shift effect, capable of covering full extent of the\nspatial-frequency component within a wide passband. The missing of\nspatial-frequency can be effectively solved by developing a\nspatial-frequency-shift actively tuning approach through wave vector\nmanipulation and operation of optical modes propagating along multiple\nazimuthal directions on a waveguide chip to interfere. In addition, the method\nincludes a chip-based sectioning capability, which is enabled by saturated\nabsorption of fluorophores.

In this\ncontext, we revisit those astrophysical hypotheses (also relevant for direct\ndetection). We focus especially on the DM velocity distribution considering\ndifferent possibilities beyond the popular Maxwellian distribution. Namely,\nsome alternatives can be considered through analytical approaches and by\nlooking into cosmological simulations of spiral galaxies. Most of the fitting\nformulas used to constrain the local velocity distribution function fail to\ndescribe the peak and the high velocity tail of the velocity distribution\nobserved in simulations, the latter being improved when adding the local escape\nvelocity of DM into the benchmark fitting models. In addition we test the\npredictions by the Eddington inversion method and also illustrate the\nimportance of the galactic dynamical history. We estimate the resulting\nuncertainties on the DM capture rate by the Sun and conclude that different\nvelocity distributions will affect the capture rate of DM by the Sun up to a\n$15-20\\%$. On top of that, the calculation of the intrinsic variance of the\ncapture rate leads to poorly controlled uncertainties especially for high WIMP\nmasses ($>$30 GeV) raising concerns about the capture scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 14:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

Several physicists have, in recent years, attempted to\nuse such tools to throw light on the mechanisms underlying a plethora of\nsocio-economic phenomena.

However, the emergence of this field has also exposed several academic\nfault-lines. Social scientists often regard physics-inspired models, such as\nthose involving spins coupled to each other, as over-simplifications of\nempirical phenomena. At the same time, while models of rational agents who\nstrategically make choices based on complete information so as to maximize\ntheir utility are commonly used in economics, many physicists consider them to\nbe caricatures of reality. We show here that while these contrasting approaches\nmay seem irreconcilable there are in fact many parallels and analogies between\nthem.

SFL techniques use control-flow spectra to pinpoint the\nmost suspicious program elements. However, data-flow spectra provide more\ndetailed information about the program execution, which may be useful for fault\nlocalization. Aims: We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of ten SFL\nranking metrics using data-flow spectra. Method: We compare the performance of\ndata- and control-flow spectra for SFL using 163 faults from 5 real-world open\nsource programs, which contain from 468 to 4130 test cases. The data- and\ncontrol-flow spectra types used in our evaluation are definition-use\nassociations (DUAs) and lines, respectively. Results: Using data-flow spectra,\nup to 50% more faults are ranked in the top-15 positions compared to\ncontrol-flow spectra. Also, most SFL ranking metrics present better\neffectiveness using data-flow to inspect up to the top-40 positions. The\nexecution cost of data-flow spectra is higher than control-flow, taking from 22\nseconds to less than 9 minutes. Data-flow has an average overhead of 353% for\nall programs, while the average overhead for control-flow is of 102%.\nConclusions: The results suggest that SFL techniques can benefit from using\ndata-flow spectra to classify faults in better positions, which may lead\ndevelopers to inspect less code to find bugs. The execution cost to gather\ndata-flow is higher compared to control-flow, but it is not prohibitive.\nMoreover, data-flow spectra also provide information about suspicious variables\nfor fault localization, which may improve the developers' performance using\nSFL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 15:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-28"}

Such\nserial execution is unable to exploit modern multi-core resources efficiently,\nhence limiting the system throughput and increasing the transaction acceptance\nlatency. The objective of this work is to increase the transaction throughput\nby introducing parallel transaction execution using a static analysis\ntechnique. We propose a framework DiPETrans for the distributed execution of\nthe transactions in a block. Here, peers in the blockchain network form a\ncommunity to execute the transactions and find the PoW parallelly, using a\nleader-follower approach. During mining, the leader statically analyzes the\ntransactions, creates different groups (shards) of independent transactions,\nand distributes them to followers to execute them in parallel. After the\ntransaction executes, the community's compute power is utilized to solve the\nPoW concurrently. When a block is successfully created, the leader broadcasts\nthe proposed block to other peers in the network for validation. On receiving a\nblock, validators re-execute the block transactions and accept the block if\nthey reach the same state as shared by the miner. Validation can also be done\nas a community, in parallel, following the same leader-follower approach as\nmining. We report experiments using over 5 Million real transactions from the\nEthereum blockchain and execute them using our DiPETrans framework to\nempirically validate the benefits of our techniques over traditional sequential\nexecution. We achieve a maximum speedup of 2.2x for the miner and 2.0x for the\nvalidator, with 100 to 500 transactions per block.

While\nmany regularization approaches have been proposed on variational autoencoders,\nheuristic tuning is required to balance between disentanglement and loss in\nreconstruction accuracy -- due to the unsupervised nature, there is no\nprincipled way to find an optimal weight for regularization. Motivated to\ncompletely bypass regularization, we consider a projection strategy: modifying\nthe canonical Gaussian encoder, we add a layer of scaling and rotation to the\nGaussian mean, such that the marginal correlations among latent sub-coordinates\nbecome exactly zero. This achieves a theoretically maximal disentanglement, as\nguaranteed by zero cross-correlation between one latent sub-coordinate and the\nobserved varying with the rest. Unlike regularizations, the extra projection\nlayer does not impact the flexibility of the previous encoder layers, leading\nto almost no loss in expressiveness. This approach is simple to implement in\npractice.

This is mainly due to the non-Gaussian property, the non-linear\nphysics, and the fact that many repeated evaluations of the forward model are\noften required. In this study, we develop a convolutional adversarial\nautoencoder (CAAE) to parameterize non-Gaussian conductivity fields with\nheterogeneous conductivity within each facies using a low-dimensional latent\nrepresentation. In addition, a deep residual dense convolutional network\n(DRDCN) is proposed for surrogate modeling of forward models with\nhigh-dimensional and highly-complex mappings.

Moreover, the fMRI data is often extremely\nhigh-dimensional and contains a lot of visually-irrelevant information.\nExisting methods generally suffer from these issues so that a satisfactory\nreconstruction is still challenging. In this paper, we show that it is possible\nto overcome these challenges by learning visually-guided cognitive latent\nrepresentations from the fMRI signals, and inversely decoding them to the image\nstimuli. The resulting framework is called Dual-Variational Autoencoder/\nGenerative Adversarial Network (D-VAE/GAN), which combines the advantages of\nadversarial representation learning with knowledge distillation. In addition,\nwe introduce a novel three-stage learning approach which enables the\n(cognitive) encoder to gradually distill useful knowledge from the paired\n(visual) encoder during the learning process.

A membrane boundary condition is presented which is\nable to accurately represent the effects of thin curvilinear membranes\ntypically found in biological tissues.

Simulations for a radiometer based on WGM\nresonance are analyzed and compared with state-of-the-art coherent receivers.\nThe results are then discussed, finding that although promising, WGM technology\nneeds R\\&D in several directions in order to be competitive, whose are\nsuggested by the authors with the idea of inspiring the work of the researchers\nin the field towards a new direction or approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 15:43:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 11:37:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 14:34:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 10:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

To reduce\ncommunication delay, the 5th generation new radio is adopted in radio access\nnetworks. To avoid long queueing delay for short packets from MC-IoT,\nProcessor-Sharing (PS) servers are deployed at MEC systems, where the service\nrate of the server is equally allocated to all the packets in the buffer. We\nderive the distribution of latency experienced by short packets in closed-form,\nand minimize the overall packet loss probability subject to the end-to-end\ndelay requirement. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we propose an\nalgorithm that converges to a near optimal solution when the throughput of eMBB\nservices is much higher than MC-IoT services, and extend it into more general\nscenarios. Furthermore, we derive the optimal solutions in two asymptotic\ncases: communication or computing is the bottleneck of reliability. Simulation\nand numerical results validate our analysis and show that the PS server\noutperforms first-come-first-serve servers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 23:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-26"}

Moreover, we also\nshow a way of constructing rotational surfaces of constant negative curvature\nin R3 by evolving these extremal curves under their associated binormal flow\nwith prescribed velocity. Finally, we prove that, locally, all rotational\nconstant negative curvature surfaces of R3 are foliated by extremal curves of\nthese energies.

The solution\ndevelop shifts the focus from the result to the strategy s ability to operate\nin a cognitive way by exploiting useful information about the system. In order\nto determine from a mathematical point of view if a strategy is cognitive, we\nuse Von Mises' axiom of randomness. Based on this axiom, the knowledge of\nuseful information consequently generates results that cannot be reproduced\nrandomly. Useful information in this case may be seen as a significant datum\nfor the recipient, for their present or future decision-making process.\nFinally, by resolving the paradox from this new point of view, we will\ndemonstrate that an expected gain that tends toward infinity is not always a\nconsequence of a cognitive and non-random strategy.

It has also been\ndescribed as the gauge boson that appears when the free electrons' Lagrangian\nin the crystal is requested to be locally gauge invariant with respect to T(3),\nthe group of the infinitesimal spatial translations. However, the\nnon-Abelianity of T(3) makes the acoustic phonon a frequency-gapped mode, in\ncontradiction with its description as Goldstone boson. A different perspective\novercomes this contradiction. In fact, we show that both the acoustic and\noptical phonon - the latter never appearing following the other two approaches\n- emerge respectively as the gapless Goldstone (phase) and the gapped Higgs\n(amplitude) fluctuation mode of an order parameter arising from the spontaneous\nbreaking of a global symmetry, without invoking the gauge principle. The\noptical phonon's frequency-gap is present in all regimes, and it arises from a\nmass-like term in the Lagrangian due to the Higgs mechanism itself. Instead, an\neventual acoustic phonon's frequency-gap appears only in the strong nonlinear\nregime, and it is due to an anharmonic term, the same term arising from the\ngauging of T(3), an approach which did not provide any description of the\noptical phonon, though. In addition, the Higgs mechanism describes all the\nphonon-phonon interactions, including a possible perturbation on the acoustic\nphonon's frequency dispersion relation induced by the eventual optical phonon,\na peculiar behavior not described so far in these terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 14:44:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 07:23:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 08:14:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}
