In\nthis paper, we present Telephonetic, a data augmentation framework that helps\nrobustify language model features to ASR corrupted inputs. To capture phonetic\nalterations, we employ a character-level language model trained using\nprobabilistic masking. Phonetic augmentations are generated in two stages: a\nTTS encoder (Tacotron 2, WaveGlow) and a STT decoder (DeepSpeech). Similarly,\nsemantic perturbations are produced by sampling from nearby words in an\nembedding space, which is computed using the BERT language model. Words are\nselected for augmentation according to a hierarchical grammar sampling\nstrategy. Telephonetic is evaluated on the Penn Treebank (PTB) corpus, and\ndemonstrates its effectiveness as a bootstrapping technique for transferring\nneural language models to the speech domain.

In high temperature and high pressure\nin-cylinder conditions, the fuel-air mixture auto-ignites creating pressure\nshock waves in the cylinder. Knock can significantly damage the engine and\nhinder its performance; as such, conservative knock control strategies are\ngenerally implemented that avoid such operating conditions at the cost of lower\nthermal efficiencies. Significant improvements in the performance of\nconventional knock controllers are possible if the properties of the knock\nprocess are better characterized and exploited in knock controller designs. One\nof the methods undertaken to better characterize knocking instances is to\nemploy a probabilistic approach, in which the likelihood of knock is derived\nfrom the statistical distribution of knock intensity. In this paper, it is\nshown that knock intensity values at a fixed operating point for single fuel\nand dual fuel engines are accurately described using a mixed lognormal\ndistribution. The fitting accuracy is compared against those for a randomly\ngenerated mixed-lognormally distributed data set, and shown to exceed a 95%\naccuracy threshold for almost all of the operating points tested. Additionally,\nthis paper discusses a stochastic knock control approach that leverages the\nmixed lognormal distribution to adjust spark timing based on knock intensity\nmeasurements. This more informed knock control strategy would allow for\nimprovements in engine performance and fuel efficiency by minimizing knock\noccurrences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 16:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

The SNe IIn found and followed by the\nPTF/iPTF were used to select a sample of 42 events with useful constraints on\nthe rise times as well as with available post-peak photometry. The sample SNe\nwere discovered in 2009-2016 and have at least one low-resolution\nclassification spectrum, as well as photometry from the P48 and P60 telescopes\nat Palomar Observatory. We study the light-curve properties of these SNe IIn\nusing spline fits (for the peak and the declining portion) and template\nmatching (for the rising portion). We find that the typical rise times are\ndivided into fast and slow risers at $20\\pm6$ d and $50\\pm11$ d, respectively.\nThe decline rates are possibly divided into two clusters, but this division has\nweak statistical significance. We find no significant correlation between the\npeak luminosity of SNe IIn and their rise times, but the more luminous SNe IIn\nare generally found to be more long-lasting. Slowly rising SNe IIn are\ngenerally found to decline slowly. The SNe in our sample were hosted by\ngalaxies of absolute magnitude $-22 \\lesssim M_g \\lesssim -13$ mag. The\nK-corrections at light-curve peak of the SNe IIn in our sample are found to be\nwithin 0.2 mag for the observer's frame $r$-band, for SNe at redshifts $z <\n0.25$. By applying K-corrections and also including ostensibly \"superluminous\"\nSNe IIn, we find that the peak magnitudes are $M_{\\rm peak}^{r} =\n-19.18\\pm1.32$ mag. We conclude that the occurrence of conspicuous light-curve\nbumps in SNe IIn, such as in iPTF13z, are limited to $1.4^{+14.6}_{-1.0} \\%$ of\nthe SNe IIn. We also investigate a possible sub-type of SNe IIn with a fast\nrise to a $\\gtrsim 50$ d plateau followed by a slow, linear decline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 16:56:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 17:35:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 14:42:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 11:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-25"}

Previous work on PAC learning of\nadversarial examples have all modeled adversarial examples as corrupted inputs\nin which the goal of the adversary is to achieve $h(\\widetilde{x}) \\neq c(x)$,\nwhere $x$ is the original untampered instance. These two definitions of\nadversarial risk coincide for many natural distributions, such as images, but\nare incomparable in general.\n  We first prove that for many theoretically natural input spaces of high\ndimension $n$ (e.g., isotropic Gaussian in dimension $n$ under $\\ell_2$\nperturbations), if the adversary is allowed to apply up to a sublinear\n$o(||x||)$ amount of perturbations on the test instances, PAC learning requires\nsample complexity that is exponential in $n$. This is in contrast with results\nproved using the corrupted-input framework, in which the sample complexity of\nrobust learning is only polynomially more.\n  We then formalize hybrid attacks in which the evasion attack is preceded by a\npoisoning attack. This is perhaps reminiscent of \"trapdoor attacks\" in which a\npoisoning phase is involved as well, but the evasion phase here uses the\nerror-region definition of risk that aims at misclassifying the perturbed\ninstances. In this case, we show PAC learning is sometimes impossible all\ntogether, even when it is possible without the attack (e.g., due to the bounded\nVC dimension).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 17:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

This\nis achieved by modeling the interaction between the robot and its environment\nas a two-player zero-sum game. However, existing reactive synthesis methods\nassume both players to have complete information, which is not the case in many\nstrategic interactions. In this paper, we use a variant of hypergames to model\nthe interaction between the robot and its environment; which has incomplete\ninformation about the specification of the robot. This model allows us to\nidentify a subset of game states from where the robot can leverage the\nasymmetrical information to achieve a better outcome, which is not possible if\nboth players have symmetrical and complete information. We then introduce a\nnovel method of opportunistic synthesis by defining a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP) using the hypergame under temporal logic specifications. When the\nenvironment plays some stochastic strategy in its perceived sure-winning and\nsure-losing regions of the game, we show that by following the opportunistic\nstrategy, the robot is ensured to only improve the outcome of the game -\nmeasured by satisfaction of sub-specifications - whenever an opportunity\nbecomes available. We demonstrate the correctness and optimality of this method\nusing a robot motion planning example in the presence of an adversary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 17:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-24"}

Their ambiguous properties motivate two potential formation\nscenarios: the \"failed\" Milky Way and the dwarf galaxy scenario. In this paper,\nfor the first time, we employ X-ray observations to test these formation\nscenarios on a sample of isolated, low-surface-brightness galaxies. Since hot\ngas X-ray luminosities correlate with the dark matter halo mass, \"failed\" Milky\nWay-type galaxies, which reside in massive dark matter halos, are expected to\nhave significantly higher X-ray luminosities than dwarf galaxies, which reside\nin low-mass dark matter halos.

The demand for tools to analyze such\ndata is therefore bigger now than ever. We present TDOSE; a flexible Python\ntool for Three Dimensional Optimal Spectral Extraction from IFS data cubes.\nTDOSE works on any three-dimensional data cube and bases the spectral\nextractions on morphological reference image models. In each wavelength layer\nof the IFS data cube, TDOSE simultaneously optimizes all sources in the\nmorphological model to minimize the difference between the scaled model\ncomponents and the IFS data. The flux optimization produces individual data\ncubes containing the scaled three-dimensional source models. This allows for\nefficient de-blending of flux in both the spatial and spectral dimensions of\nthe IFS data cubes, and extraction of the corresponding one-dimensional\nspectra. We present an example of how the three-dimensional source models\ngenerated by TDOSE can be used to improve two-dimensional maps of physical\nparameters. By extracting TDOSE spectra of $\\sim$150 [OII] emitters from the\nMUSE-Wide survey we show that the median increase in line flux is $\\sim$5% when\nusing multi-component models as opposed to single-component models. However,\nthe increase in recovered line emission in individual cases can be as much as\n50%. Comparing the TDOSE model-based extractions of the MUSE-Wide [OII]\nemitters with aperture spectra, the TDOSE spectra provides a median flux (S/N)\nincrease of 9% (14%). Hence, TDOSE spectra optimizes the S/N while still being\nable to recover the total emitted flux.

Recent approaches have argued for going beyond convolutions in order\nto capture long-range dependencies. These efforts focus on augmenting\nconvolutional models with content-based interactions, such as self-attention\nand non-local means, to achieve gains on a number of vision tasks. The natural\nquestion that arises is whether attention can be a stand-alone primitive for\nvision models instead of serving as just an augmentation on top of\nconvolutions. In developing and testing a pure self-attention vision model, we\nverify that self-attention can indeed be an effective stand-alone layer. A\nsimple procedure of replacing all instances of spatial convolutions with a form\nof self-attention applied to ResNet model produces a fully self-attentional\nmodel that outperforms the baseline on ImageNet classification with 12% fewer\nFLOPS and 29% fewer parameters. On COCO object detection, a pure self-attention\nmodel matches the mAP of a baseline RetinaNet while having 39% fewer FLOPS and\n34% fewer parameters.

In our approach the caustic\nsurfaces are approximated by a set of triangles whose vertices are particles of\nthe simulation. The major obstacle we encountered was insufficient sampling of\nsmall scale perturbations. We overcame it by a brute force approach. We\ncontinued to raise the scale of the cutoff in the initial power spectrum until\nobtained the reliable resolution of the caustics shells up to seven layers.\nAlthough quite modest, our result is the first reliable direct construction of\ncaustic surfaces in N-body simulation. It reveals a number of unexpected\ngeometrical features. In particular shapes of some of them are contrastingly\ndifferent from the known shapes of the caustics formed in the Zeldovich\napproximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:40:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-17"}

Due to rapid growth in thread-level parallelism of GPU and slowly\nimproved peak memory bandwidth, the memory becomes a bottleneck of GPU's\nperformance and energy efficiency. In this work, we propose an integrated\narchitectural scheme to optimize the memory accesses and therefore boost the\nperformance and energy efficiency of GPU. Firstly, we propose a thread batch\nenabled memory partitioning (TEMP) to improve GPU memory access parallelism. In\nparticular, TEMP groups multiple thread blocks that share the same set of pages\ninto a thread batch and applies a page coloring mechanism to bound each stream\nmultiprocessor (SM) to the dedicated memory banks. After that, TEMP dispatches\nthe thread batch to an SM to ensure high-parallel memory-access streaming from\nthe different thread blocks. Secondly, a thread batch-aware scheduling (TBAS)\nscheme is introduced to improve the GPU memory access locality and to reduce\nthe contention on memory controllers and interconnection networks. Experimental\nresults show that the integration of TEMP and TBAS can achieve up to 10.3%\nperformance improvement and 11.3% DRAM energy reduction across diverse GPU\napplications. We also evaluate the performance interference of the mixed\nCPU+GPU workloads when they are run on a heterogeneous system that employs our\nproposed schemes. Our results show that a simple solution can effectively\nensure the efficient execution of both GPU and CPU applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-17"}

Street View can be a sensible testbed for such RL\nagents, because it provides real-world photographic imagery at ground level,\nwith diverse street appearances; it has been made into an interactive\nenvironment called StreetLearn and used for research on navigation. However,\ngoal-driven street navigation agents have not so far been able to transfer to\nunseen areas without extensive retraining, and relying on simulation is not a\nscalable solution. Since aerial images are easily and globally accessible, we\npropose instead to train a multi-modal policy on ground and aerial views, then\ntransfer the ground view policy to unseen (target) parts of the city by\nutilizing aerial view observations. Our core idea is to pair the ground view\nwith an aerial view and to learn a joint policy that is transferable across\nviews. We achieve this by learning a similar embedding space for both views,\ndistilling the policy across views and dropping out visual modalities. We\nfurther reformulate the transfer learning paradigm into three stages: 1)\ncross-modal training, when the agent is initially trained on multiple city\nregions, 2) aerial view-only adaptation to a new area, when the agent is\nadapted to a held-out region using only the easily obtainable aerial view, and\n3) ground view-only transfer, when the agent is tested on navigation tasks on\nunseen ground views, without aerial imagery.

Examples of emerging\npatterns are the spots and stripes on the coat or skin of animals, the spatial\ndistribution of vegetation in arid areas, the organization of the colonies of\ninsects in host-parasitoid systems and the architecture of large complex\necosystems. Spatial self-organization can be described following the visionary\nintuition of Alan Turing, who showed how non-linear interactions between slow\ndiffusing activators and fast diffusing inhibitors could induce patterns. The\nTuring instability, as the mechanism described is universally referred to, was\nraised to paradigm status in those realms of investigations where microscopic\nentities are subject to diffusion, from small biological systems to large\necosystems. Requiring a significant ratio of the assigned diffusion constants\nhowever is a stringent constraint, which limited the applicability of the\ntheory. Building on the observation that spatial interactions are usually\ndirection biased, and often strongly asymmetric, we here propose a novel\nframework for the generation of short wavelength patterns which overcomes the\nlimitation inherent in the Turing formulation. In particular, we will prove\nthat patterns can always set in when the system is composed by sufficiently\nmany cells - the units of spatial patchiness - and for virtually any ratio of\nthe diffusivities involved.

Past work in this area has only looked at reducing intra-class\nvariability by elastic temporal alignment.

(2) For dynamical capture of PBHs\nin stars, we derive a general result on the capture rate based on phase space\narguments. We argue that survival of stars does not constrain PBHs, but that\ndisruption of stars by captured PBHs should occur and that the asteroid-mass\nPBH hypothesis could be constrained if we can work out the observational\nsignature of this process.

For nonlinear dynamical\nsystems exhibiting strongly coherent structures, DMD can be a useful\napproximation to extract dominant, interpretable modes. In many domains with\nlarge spatiotemporal data---including fluid dynamics, video processing, and\nfinance---the dynamics of interest are often perturbations about fixed points\nor equilibria, which motivates the application of DMD to centered (i.e.\nmean-subtracted) data. In this work, we show that DMD with centered data is\nequivalent to incorporating an affine term in the dynamic model and is not\nequivalent to computing a discrete Fourier transform. Importantly, DMD with\ncentering can always be used to compute eigenvalue spectra of the dynamics.\nHowever, in many cases DMD without centering cannot model the corresponding\ndynamics, most notably if the dynamics have full effective rank. Additionally,\nwe generalize the notion of centering to extracting arbitrary, but known, fixed\nfrequencies from the data. We corroborate these theoretical results numerically\non three nonlinear examples: the Lorenz system, a surveillance video, and brain\nrecordings. Since centering the data is simple and computationally efficient,\nwe recommend it as a preprocessing step before DMD; furthermore, we suggest\nthat it can be readily used in conjunction with many other popular\nimplementations of the DMD algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 00:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-17"}

The LearnBD algorithm includes two phases: (i)\nsampling cuts and collecting information from training problems and (ii)\nsolving testing problems with a support vector machine (SVM) cut classifier. We\nrun the LearnBD algorithm on instances of capacitated facility location and\nmulti-commodity network design under uncertain demand. Our results show that\nSVM cut classifier works effectively for identifying valuable cuts, and the\nLearnBD algorithm reduces the total solving time of all instances for different\nproblems with various sizes and complexities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 02:54:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 14:27:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 16:07:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 02:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-16"}

The whole framework can be\ntrained end-to-end and is able to handle text of arbitrary shapes. The\nconvolutional features are calculated only once and shared by both detection\nand recognition modules. Through multi-task training, the learned features\nbecome more discriminate and improve the overall performance. By employing the\n$2$D attention model in word recognition, the irregularity of text can be\nrobustly addressed. It provides the spatial location for each character, which\nnot only helps local feature extraction in word recognition, but also indicates\nan orientation angle to refine text localization.

This paper utilizes knowledge distillation through\nteacher-student paradigm (Hinton et al., 2015) in a novel setting that exploits\nthe feature extraction capability of DNNs for higher-accuracy quantization. As\nsuch, our algorithm logically divides a pretrained full-precision DNN to\nmultiple sections, each of which exposes intermediate features to train a team\nof students independently in the quantized domain.

According to the standard scenario, the magnetic field is reduced\nas a consequence of accretion, either through ohmic dissipation or through\nscreening by the accreted matter. We explored an alternative hypothesis in\nwhich the magnetic field is reduced through ambipolar diffusion before the\naccretion. This is particularly effective during the long epoch in which the\npulsar has cooled, but has not yet started accreting. This makes the final\nmagnetic field dependent on the evolution time of the companion star and thus\nits initial mass.

Here, the\nself-potential (SP) method, a passive electrical geophysical method, is used to\ncharacterize water flow in situ. Unlike tensiometers, which use a measurement\nof state (i.e. matric pressure) at two locations to infer fluid flow, the SP\nmethod directly measures signals generated by water movement. We collected SP\nmeasurements in a two-dimensional array at the base of a Douglas-fir tree\n(Pseudotsuga menziesii) in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in western\nOregon over five months to provide insight on the propagation of transpiration\nsignals into the subsurface under variable soil moisture. During dry\nconditions, SP data appear to show downward unsaturated flow, while nearby\ntensiometer data appear to suggest upward flow during this period. After the\ntrees enter dormancy in the fall, precipitation-induced vertical flow dominates\nin the SP and tensiometer data. Diel variations in SP data correspond to\nperiods of tree transpiration. Changes in volumetric water content occurring\nfrom soil moisture movement during transpiration are not large enough to appear\nin volumetric water content data. Fluid flow and electrokinetic coupling (i.e.\nelectrical potential distribution) were simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics to\nexplore the system controls on field data. The coupled model, which included a\nroot-water uptake term, reproduced components of both the long-term and diel\nvariations in SP measurements, thus indicating that SP has potential to provide\nspatially and temporally dense measurements of transpiration-induced changes in\nwater flow.

In this paper, we consider a\npossibility that the signal recorded by the Geograv resonant gravitational-wave\ndetector in 1987 during the explosion of SN 1987A was produced by an abrupt\nchange in the metric during the passage of a strong neutrino flux through the\ndetector. Such an impact on the detector is possible, in particular, in\nextended scalar-tensor theories in which the local matter density gradient\naffects the gravitational force. The first short neutrino pulse emitted at the\ninitial stage of stellar core collapse before the onset of neutrino opacity\ncould exert a major influence on the detector by exiting the detector response\nat the main resonance frequency. In contrast, the influence of the subsequent\nbroad pulse (with a duration of several seconds) in the resonant detector is\nexponentially suppressed, despite the fact that the second pulse carries an\norder-of-magnitude more neutrino energy, and it could generate a signal in the\nLSD neutrino detector. This explains the time delay of 1.4s between the Geograv\nand LSD signals. The consequences of this effect of modified gravity for\nLIGO/Virgo observations are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 09:26:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

For the former regime, as the parametric\ngain of OPA increases to a critical value, the classical dynamics of the\noptical or mechanical modes can experience a transition from the regular\nperiodic oscillation to period-doubling motion, in which cases the\nlight-mechanical entanglement can be well studied by the logarithm negativity\nand can manifest the dynamical transition in the classical nonlinear dynamics.\nMoreover, the optomechanical entanglement shows a second-order transition\ncharacteristic at the critical parametric gain. For the latter regime, the kind\nof normal mode splitting comes up in the laser detuning dependence of\noptomechanical entanglement, which is induced by the squeezing of the optical\nand mechanical hybrid modes and finds no classical correspondence. The OPA\nassisted optomechanical systems therefore offer a simple way to study and\nexploit quantum manifestations of classical nonlinear dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 09:57:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 11:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

Here we perform a high-redshift analysis to check if this new\nmodel is compatible with present day observational data and compare predictions\nof this model with that of the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model.

In\nthis work, we rigorously study the extension of network pruning strategies to\npreserve both benign accuracy and robustness of a network. Starting with a\nformal definition of the pruning procedure, including pre-training, weights\npruning, and fine-tuning, we propose a new pruning method that can create\ncompact networks while preserving both benign accuracy and robustness.

To\nconfirm the existence of this emission and to understand its relation to the\nsolar activity, we conducted an additional Suzaku observation in 2014 around\nthe maximum of the 24th solar cycle.

The luminosity of the\npoint-like emission which was probably composed of solar X-ray scattering,\ncharge exchange, or auroral bremsstrahlung emission increased by a factor of $\n\\sim 5$ with respect to 2006, most likely due to an increase of the solar\nactivity. The diffuse emission spectrum in the $1\\unicode{x2013}5$ keV band was\nwell-fitted with a flat power-law function ($ \\Gamma = 1.4 \\pm 0.1 $) as in the\npast observation, which supported the inverse-Compton scattering hypothesis.\nHowever, its spatial distribution changed from $ \\sim 12 \\times 4 $ Jovian\nradius (Rj) to $ \\sim 20 \\times 7 $ Rj. The luminosity of the diffuse emission\nincreased by a smaller factor of $ \\sim 3 $. This indicates that the diffuse\nemission is not simply responding to the solar activity, which is also known to\ncause little effect on the distribution of high-energy electrons around\nJupiter.

However, the estimates are subject\nto the choice of the distribution of baryons needed in this type of studies. In\nthis work we explore several Galactic mass models that differ in the\ndistribution of baryons and dark matter, in order to determine $\\rho_{{\\rm\nDM},\\odot}$. For this purpose we analyze the precise circular velocity curve\nmeasurement of the Milky Way up to $\\sim 25$ kpc from the Galactic centre\nobtained from Gaia DR2 [1]. We find that the estimated value of $\\rho_{{\\rm\nDM},\\odot}$ stays robust to reasonable changes in the spherical dark matter\nhalo. However, we show that $\\rho_{{\\rm DM},\\odot}$ is affected by the choice\nof the model for the underlying baryonic components. In particular, we find\nthat $\\rho_{{\\rm DM},\\odot}$ is mostly sensitive to uncertainties in the disk\ncomponents of the Galaxy. We also show that, when choosing one particular\nbaryonic model, the estimate of $\\rho_{{\\rm DM},\\odot}$ has an uncertainty of\nonly about $10\\%$ of its best-fit value, but this uncertainty gets much bigger\nwhen we also consider the variation of the baryonic model. In particular, the\nrotation curve method does not allow to exclude the presence of an additional\nvery thin component, that can increase $\\rho_{{\\rm DM},\\odot}$ by more than a\nfactor of 8 (the thin disk could even be made of dark matter). Therefore, we\nconclude that exclusively using the rotation curve of the Galaxy is not enough\nto provide a robust estimate of $\\rho_{{\\rm DM},\\odot}$.

However, the\ndrawback with this certificate lies in its realization dependency. Firstly,\ncomputing such a realization requires to find a polyhedral cone with a\npotentially high number of extremal generators that lifts the dimension of the\nstate-space representation, significantly. Secondly, not all externally\npositive systems posses an internally positive realization. Thirdly, in many\ntypical applications such as controller design, system identification and model\norder reduction, internal positivity is not preserved. To overcome these\ndrawbacks, we present a tractable sufficient certificate of external positivity\nbased on second-order cones. This certificate does not require any special\nstate-space realization: if it succeeds with a possibly non-minimal\nrealization, then it will do so with any minimal realization. While there exist\nsystems where this certificate is also necessary, we also demonstrate how to\nconstruct systems, where both second-order and polyhedral cones as well as\nother certificates fail. Nonetheless, in contrast to other realization\nindependent certificates, the present one appears to be favourable in terms of\napplicability and conservatism. Three applications are representatively\ndiscussed to underline its potential. We show how the certificate can be used\nto find externally positive approximations of nearly externally positive\nsystems and demonstrated that this may help to reduce system identification\nerrors.

Multiple tools that have been developed, in the\nrecent years, for assessment of urban climate, building energy demand, the\noutdoor thermal comfort and the energy systems. In this review, we, however,\nnoted that these tools often address only one or two of these urban planning\naspects. There is however an intricate link between them. For instance, the\noutdoor comfort assessment has showed that there is a strong link between\nbiometeorology and architecture and urban climate. Additionally, to address the\nchallenges of the energy transition, there will be a convergence of the energy\nneeds in the future with an energy nexus regrouping the energy demand of urban\nareas. It is also highlighted that the uncertainty related to future climatic\ndata makes urban adaptation and mitigation strategies complex to implement and\nto design given the lack of a comprehensive framework. We thus conclude by\nsuggesting the need for a holistic interface to take into account this\nmulti-dimensional problem.

This high\nresolution makes it possible to separate the emission associated with the inner\nhot envelope and disk around the forming star from that of its cool outer\nenvelope. In addition, the high sensitivity of ALMA makes it possible to\nidentify weak and optically thin lines and allows for many isotopologues to be\ndetected, providing a more complete and accurate inventory of the source. A\ntotal of 23 different molecular species and their isotopologues are detected in\nthe spectrum towards AFGL 4176.

Benefitting from field enhancement effects, namely\ntip-enhancement and plasmonic enhancement, laser-induced field emission is\nrealized over large, dense and highly uniform field emitter arrays. The\ntheoretical principles of these field emitter arrays are studied and their\nsuitability for pico-Coulomb charge production over femtosecond time-scales is\nconfirmed. In the framework of THz injectors, two ground-breaking concepts\nincluding ultrafast single-cycle THz guns and segmented THz electron\naccelerator and manipulator (STEAM) devices are developed and tested. The\npossibility of using transient fields to realize ultrahigh acceleration\ngradients close to 0.5 GeV/m is confirmed.

Travelling wave THz linacs based on dielectric-loaded\nmetallic waveguides operating under few-cycle excitations are proposed. Based\non this concept, keV-level energy gain through a linear accelerator using\noptically-generated THz pulses is demonstrated.

In particular, a coherently oscillating classical dark-matter field may\ninduce apparent oscillations of physical constants in time, while the passage\nof macroscopic dark-matter objects (such as topological defects) may induce\napparent transient variations in the physical constants. In this paper, we\npoint out several new signatures of the aforementioned types of dark matter\nthat can arise due to the geometric asymmetry created by the beam-splitter in a\ntwo-arm laser interferometer. These new signatures include dark-matter-induced\ntime-varying size changes of a freely-suspended beam-splitter and associated\ntime-varying shifts of the main reflecting surface of the beam-splitter that\nsplits and recombines the laser beam, as well as time-varying refractive-index\nchanges in the freely-suspended beam-splitter and time-varying size changes of\nfreely-suspended arm mirrors. We demonstrate that existing ground-based\nexperiments already have sufficient sensitivity to probe extensive regions of\nunconstrained parameter space in models involving oscillating scalar\ndark-matter fields and domain walls composed of scalar fields.

The scattered object wave interferes with the reference (unscattered)\nwave at the plane where a digital sensor is situated, producing a digital\nhologram that can be processed in several ways to extract and numerically\nreconstruct an in-focus image using the back propagation algorithm. Without\nrequiring any lenses and other intermediate optical components, the LFOCDHM has\nunique advantages of offering a large effective numerical aperture (NA) close\nto unity across the native wide field-of-view (FOV) of the imaging sensor in a\ncost-effective and compact design. However, unlike conventional coherent\ndiffraction limited imaging systems, where the limiting aperture is used to\ndefine the system performance, typical lens-free microscopes only produce\ncompromised imaging resolution that far below the ideal coherent diffraction\nlimit. At least five major factors may contribute to this limitation, namely,\nthe sample-to-sensor distance, spatial and temporal coherence of the\nillumination, finite size of the equally spaced sensor pixels, and finite\nextent of the image sub-FOV used for the reconstruction, which have not been\nsystematically and rigorously explored until now.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of\ninaccurate angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation as a beam alignment impairment on\nthe performance of a directional mmWave D2D network. We have used tools from\nstochastic geometry to quantify the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio\n(SINR) coverage probability in the presence of beam misalignment, which can be\napplied to evaluate D2D network performance. Moreover, the analytical results\nare verified to be reliable and effective through extensive simulations.\nFinally, the coverage probability of the D2D network with erroneous beam\nalignment is compared to the network with perfect beam alignment. The numerical\nresults indicate that the beam misalignment can lead to significant losses in\nthe network's coverage probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 14:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-17"}

The\nDAWs are spontaneously excited in dusty plasma after adding more particles in\nthe confining potential well and found to propagate in the direction of\nstreaming ions. The spontaneous excitation of such low-frequency modes is\npossible due to the instabilities associated with streaming ions through the\ndust grain medium. The background E-field and neutral pressure determine the\nstability of excited DAWs. The characteristics of DAWs strongly depend on the\nstrength of external magnetic field. The magnetic field of strength B $<$ 0.05\nT only modifies the characteristics of propagating waves in dusty plasma at\nmoderate power and pressure, P = 3.5 W and p = 27 Pa respectively. It is found\nthat DAWs start to be damped with increasing the magnetic field beyond B $>$\n0.05 T and get completely damped at higher magnetic field B $\\sim$ 0.13 T.\nAfter lowering the power and pressure to 3 W and 23 Pa respectively, the\nexcited DAWs in the absence of B are slightly unstable. In this case, the\nmagnetic field only stabilizes and modifies the propagation characteristics of\nDAWs while the strength of B is increased up to 0.1 T or even higher. The\nmodification of the sheath electric field where particles are confined in the\npresence of the external magnetic field is the main cause of the modification\nand damping of the DAWs in a magnetized rf discharge plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 15:45:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2019 08:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

One major challenge is the frequently occurred coreference\nand information omission in our daily conversation, making it hard for machines\nto understand the real intention. In this paper, we propose rewriting the human\nutterance as a pre-process to help multi-turn dialgoue modelling. Each\nutterance is first rewritten to recover all coreferred and omitted information.\nThe next processing steps are then performed based on the rewritten utterance.\nTo properly train the utterance rewriter, we collect a new dataset with human\nannotations and introduce a Transformer-based utterance rewriting architecture\nusing the pointer network. We show the proposed architecture achieves\nremarkably good performance on the utterance rewriting task. The trained\nutterance rewriter can be easily integrated into online chatbots and brings\ngeneral improvement over different domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 06:45:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

It consists of a\nstochastic-gradient-descent (SGD) based base-learner used for the field model\nprediction aiming to minimize the average prediction error, and a reinforcement\nmeta-learner aiming to optimize the sensing decision by simultaneously\nrewarding the error reduction with samples obtained so far and penalizing the\ncorresponding communication cost. An adaptive sensing algorithm based on the\nabove two-layer meta-learning framework is presented. It actively determines\nthe next most informative sensing location, and thus considerably reduces the\nspatial samples and yields superior performance and robustness compared with\nconventional schemes.

However, these methods rely\non defining specific regions where the spatial information a point contributes\nis limited to binary 0 or 1, of either inside or outside the region, while in\nreality anomalies will tend to follow smooth distributions with decaying\ndensity further from an epicenter. In this work, we propose a method that\naddresses this shortcoming through a continuous scan statistic that generalizes\nSSS by allowing the point contribution to be defined by a kernel. We provide\nextensive experimental and theoretical results that shows our methods can be\ncomputed efficiently while providing high statistical power for detecting\nanomalous regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:45:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 21:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

Its main challenges\nfor large-scale data sets are visual clutter and overplotting which hamper the\nrecognition of patterns and trends in the data. In this paper, we propose a\nconfluent drawing approach of parallel coordinates to support the web-based\ninteractive visual analytics of large multi-dimensional data. The proposed\nmethod maps multi-dimensional data to node-link diagrams through the data\nbinning-based clustering for each dimension. It uses density-based confluent\ndrawing to visualize clusters and edges to reduce visual clutter and\noverplotting. Its rendering time is independent of the number of data items. It\nsupports interactive visualization of large data sets without hardware\nacceleration in a normal web browser. Moreover, we design interactions to\ncontrol the data binning process with this approach to support interactive\nvisual analytics of large multi-dimensional data sets. Based on the proposed\napproach, we implement a web-based visual analytics application. The efficiency\nof the proposed method is examined through experiments on several data sets.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through a user study, in\nwhich two typical tasks of parallel coordinates plot are performed by\nparticipants to compare the proposed method with another parallel coordinates\nbundling technique. Results show that the proposed method significantly\nenhances the web-based interactive visual analytics of large multi-dimensional\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 12:14:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

Nevertheless, in some cases, rational investors with a certain level\nof experience are able to ordinally rank investment alternatives through\nrelative assessments of the probabilities that investments will be successful.\nHowever, to apply traditional portfolio optimization models, analysts must use\nhistorical (or simulated/expected) return data as the basis for their\ncalculations. This paper develops an alternative portfolio optimization\nframework that is able to handle this kind of information (given by an ordinal\nranking of investment alternatives) and to calculate an optimal capital\nallocation based on a Cobb-Douglas function, which we call the Sorted Weighted\nPortfolio (SWP). Considering risk-neutral investors, we show that the results\nof this portfolio optimization model usually outperform the output generated by\nthe (intuitive) Equally Weighted Portfolio (EWP) of different investment\nalternatives, which is the result of optimization when one is unable to\nincorporate additional data (the ordinal ranking of the alternatives). To\nfurther extend this work, we show that our model can also address risk-averse\ninvestors to capture correlation effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 08:57:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 04:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Currently available\nmobility datasets are restricted to geospatial information obtained through a\nsingle sensor at low spatiotemporal granularities. Furthermore, this passively\ncollected data lacks ground-truth information regarding points of interest and\ntheir semantic labels. These features are critical in order to push the\npossibilities of geospatial data analysis towards analyzing mobility behaviors\nand movement patterns at a fine-grained scale. To this end, Breadcrumbs\nprovides ground-truth and semantic labels for the points of interest of all the\nparticipants.
