The observed spectral\nline profile becomes asymmetric, and it becomes impossible to extract the value\nof transition frequency from this profile in a unique way. Nonresonant\ncorrections depend on the type of experiment and on the experimental\narrangement.

As a result, declarative user queries\nin these environments need to be optimized and executed over resources that\nconstantly change and are provisioned on demand for each job. This requires us\nto rethink traditional query optimizers designed for systems that run on\ndedicated resources. In this paper, we show evidence that the choice of query\nplans depends heavily on the available resources, and the current practice of\nchoosing query plans before picking the resources could lead to significant\nperformance loss in two popular big data systems, namely Hive and SparkSQL.\nTherefore, we make a case for Resource and Query Optimization (or RAQO), i.e.,\nchoosing both the query plan and the resource configuration at the same time.\nWe describe rule-based RAQO and present alternate decisions trees to make\nresource-aware query planning in Hive and Spark. We further present cost-based\nRAQO that integrates resource planning within a query planner, and show\ntechniques to significantly reduce the resource planning overheads. We evaluate\ncost-based RAQO using state-of-the-art System R query planner as well as a\nrecently proposed multi-objective query planner. Our evaluation on TPC-H and\nrandomly generated schemas show that: (i) we can reduce the resource planning\noverhead by up to 16x, and (ii) RAQO can scale to schemas as large as 100 table\njoins as well as clusters as big as 100K containers with 100GB each.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2019 16:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

However, optimizing the {\\em data gathering schedule}, i.e. optimizing\nthe transmission schedule of the sub-sinks to the $MS$ and the movement speed\nof the $MS$ can reduce data gathering latency.

The best 4D\nreconstruction algorithms use regularized iterative reconstruction approaches\nsuch as model based iterative reconstruction (MBIR), which depends critically\non the quality of the prior modeling. Recently, Plug-and-Play methods have been\nshown to be an effective way to incorporate advanced prior models using\nstate-of-the-art denoising algorithms designed to remove additive white\nGaussian noise (AWGN). However, state-of-the-art denoising algorithms such as\nBM4D and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are primarily available for\n2D and sometimes 3D images. In particular, CNNs are difficult and\ncomputationally expensive to implement in four or more dimensions, and training\nmay be impossible if there is no associated high-dimensional training data.\n  In this paper, we present Multi-Slice Fusion, a novel algorithm for 4D and\nhigher-dimensional reconstruction, based on the fusion of multiple\nlow-dimensional denoisers. Our approach uses multi-agent consensus equilibrium\n(MACE), an extension of Plug-and-Play, as a framework for integrating the\nmultiple lower-dimensional prior models. We apply our method to the problem of\n4D cone-beam X-ray CT reconstruction for Non Destructive Evaluation (NDE) of\nmoving parts. This is done by solving the MACE equations using\nlower-dimensional CNN denoisers implemented in parallel on a heterogeneous\ncluster. Results on experimental CT data demonstrate that Multi-Slice Fusion\ncan substantially improve the quality of reconstructions relative to\ntraditional 4D priors, while also being practical to implement and train.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2019 18:37:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

However, existing methods train only certain\nsub-modules using loss functions that often do not correlate with established\ntracking evaluation measures such as Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and\nPrecision (MOTP). As these measures are not differentiable, the choice of\nappropriate loss functions for end-to-end training of multi-object tracking\nmethods is still an open research problem. In this paper, we bridge this gap by\nproposing a differentiable proxy of MOTA and MOTP, which we combine in a loss\nfunction suitable for end-to-end training of deep multi-object trackers. As a\nkey ingredient, we propose a Deep Hungarian Net (DHN) module that approximates\nthe Hungarian matching algorithm.

Recently, sophisticated priors such as dark\nchannel prior, extreme channel prior, and local maximum gradient prior, have\nshown promising effectiveness. However, these methods are computationally\nexpensive. Meanwhile, since these priors involved subproblems cannot be solved\nexplicitly, approximate solution is commonly used, which limits the best\nexploitation of their capability. To address these problems, this work firstly\nproposes a simplified sparsity prior of local minimal pixels, namely patch-wise\nminimal pixels (PMP). The PMP of clear images is much more sparse than that of\nblurred ones, and hence is very effective in discriminating between clear and\nblurred images. Then, a novel algorithm is designed to efficiently exploit the\nsparsity of PMP in deblurring. The new algorithm flexibly imposes sparsity\ninducing on the PMP under the MAP framework rather than directly uses the half\nquadratic splitting algorithm. By this, it avoids non-rigorous approximation\nsolution in existing algorithms, while being much more computationally\nefficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can\nachieve better practical stability compared with state-of-the-arts. In terms of\ndeblurring quality, robustness and computational efficiency, the new algorithm\nis superior to state-of-the-arts.

Some schemes, particularly L-stable methods, offer\nsignificantly better convergence than others as they are guaranteed to converge\nrapidly at both limits of small and large $h_t\\xi$, where $\\xi$ denotes an\neigenvalue of $\\mathcal{L}$ and $h_t$ time-step size. On the other hand, some\nschemes do not obtain $h$-optimal convergence, and two-level convergence is\nrestricted to certain regimes. In certain cases, an $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ factor\nchange in time step $h_t$ or coarsening factor $k$ can be the difference\nbetween convergence factors $\\rho\\approx0.02$ and divergence! The analysis is\nextended to skew symmetric operators as well, which cannot obtain\n$h$-independent convergence and, in fact, will generally not converge for a\nsufficiently large number of time steps. Numerical results confirm the analysis\nin practice and emphasize the importance of a priori analysis in choosing an\neffective coarse-grid scheme and coarsening factor. A Mathematica notebook to\nperform a priori two-grid analysis is available at\nhttps://github.com/XBraid/xbraid-convergence-est.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 2019 12:54:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 05:46:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

In\nthis work, we propose a deep progressive quantization (DPQ) model, as an\nalternative to PQ, for large scale image retrieval. DPQ learns the quantization\ncodes sequentially and approximates the original feature space progressively.\nTherefore, we can train the quantization codes with different code lengths\nsimultaneously.

A new spectral reconstructed model is\nproposed by the information of several typical bands instead of all of the\nwavelength bands, and a linear combination spectral reconstruction model is\nalso discussed. By selecting 4 typical spectral datasets including green\nvegetation, bare soil, rangeland and concrete in the spectral range of 400-900\nnm, the PCA results show that 6 principal components could characterized the\nspectral dataset, and the relative reconstructed errors are smaller than 2%. If\nonly 6-7 selected typical bands are employed to spectral reconstruction for all\nthe surface reflectance in 400-900 nm, except that the reconstructed error of\ngreen vegetation is about 3.3%, the relative errors of other 3 datasets are all\nsmaller than 1.6%. The correlation coefficients of those 4 datasets are all\nlarger than 0.99, which can effectively satisfy the needs of spectral\nreconstruction. In addition, based on the spectral library and the linear\ncombination model of 4 common used bands of satellite remote sensing such as\n490, 555, 670 and 865 nm, the reconstructed errors are smaller than 8.5% in\nhigh reflectance region and smaller than 1.5% in low reflectance region\nrespectively, which basically meet the needs of spectral reconstruction. This\nstudy can provide a reference value for the surface reflectance processing and\nspectral reconstruction in satellite remote sensing research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2019 16:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}
