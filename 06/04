For this task, Temporal\nDensity Extrapolation (TDX) is proposed. This novel method models and predicts\ngradual monotonous changes in a distribution. It is based on the expansion of\nbasis functions, whose weights are modelled as functions of compositional data\nover time by using an isometric log-ratio transformation. Extrapolated density\nestimates are then obtained by extrapolating the weights to the requested time\npoint, and querying the density from the basis functions with back-transformed\nweights.

The full parameter range is explored for each method to\ndetermine the best choices for planet discovery. We conclude that the ideal\nmethod is a time-windowed slider with an iterative robust location estimator\nbased on Tukey's biweight. This method recovers 99% and 94% of the shallowest\nKepler and K2 planets, respectively. We include an additional analysis for\nyoung stars with extreme variability and conclude they are best treated using a\nspline-based method with a robust Huber estimator. All stellar detrending\nmethods explored are available for public use in wotan, an open-source Python\npackage on GitHub (see https://github.com/hippke/wotan).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 17:56:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 17:50:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

While\nthe nature of these states is well understood, the dynamical mechanisms\nunderpinning their formation remain largely unexplored and are the subject of\nthis study. We find that the long-range tail of the Coulomb interactions\nbetween monopoles plays a central role by suppressing the monopole-assisted\ndecay of noncontractible pairs with respect to monopole-antimonopole\nannihilation. In conjunction with low final quench temperatures, where the\nsystem enters a nonhydrodynamic regime in which the monopoles effectively move\nat terminal velocity in the direction of the local force acting on them, the\ninteractions lead to a metastable plateau that persists in the thermodynamic\nlimit. This is a remarkable phenomenon, reminiscent of jamming and some\ninstances of glassiness: A transient modification of the short-time dynamics of\nthe system allows it to enter a metastable state whose lifetime can easily be\nastronomically large at (experimentally relevant) low temperatures. We\ndemonstrate this using Monte Carlo simulations and mean field population\ndynamics theory, and we provide an analytical understanding of the mechanisms\nat play. When the interactions between monopoles are truncated to finite range,\nthe metastable plateau reduces to a finite size effect.

We estimate for these objects that at least 3-5 per cent of\ntheir bolometric luminosity is being converted into the kinetic power of the\nobserved wind.

The advantage of these dualities is that regions\nof the phase diagram which may be obscure on one side of the duality can be\naccessed by condensing local operators on the other side. Starting from parent\nAbelian states, we use this approach to construct Landau-Ginzburg theories of\nnon-Abelian states through a pairing mechanism.

Such a state can be described in terms of a state of closed,\ninteracting, fundamental strings in their high-temperature Hagedorn phase. The\nentropy density in this state is equal to the square root of the energy density\nin Planck units, while the pressure is positive and equal to the energy\ndensity. These relations imply a maximally large entropy density and,\ntherefore, a state that cannot be described by a semiclassical spacetime\ngeometry. If one nevertheless insists on an effective semiclassical description\nof this state, she can do so by ignoring the entropy. This leads to a partially\nequivalent description in which the pressure appears to be negative and equal\nin magnitude to the energy density, as if the energy-momentum tensor was that\nof a cosmological constant. From this effective perspective, the state\ndescribes a period of string-scale inflation. The bound state of strings\nultimately decays, possibly by a process akin to Hawking radiation, and\nundergoes a transition into a phase of hot radiation. But, from the effective\nperspective, the same decay corresponds to the heating of the Universe at the\nend of inflation. Small quantum mechanical fluctuations in the initial state\nlead to scale-invariant temperature anisotropies in the hot radiation. The\ntemperature anisotropies are interpreted in the effective description as\narising from quantum fluctuations of the curvature and an effective inflaton\nfield. The stringy microscopic description determines the parameters of the\nmodel of inflation, as well as the cosmological observables, in terms of the\nstring length scale and coupling strength. Our framework is similar,\nconceptually, to a recent description of black holes in terms of a maximal\nentropy state of strings in the Hagedorn phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 18:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

In principle, several counter-terms may be needed to\nhandle the short-distance sensitivity in perturbation theory. However, we show\nthat a small number of extra coefficients are sufficient to match numerical\nsimulations with percent accuracy when a generic renormalization prescription\nis implemented (allowing for running of the individual counter-terms). We show\nthat the level of accuracy increases with respect to the two loop results, up\nto $k \\simeq 0.4\\, h$Mpc$^{-1}$ at redshift $z=0$, although the overall\nimprovement is somewhat marginal. At the same time, we argue there is evidence\nthat the behavior of the loop expansion in the EFTofLSS is typical of an\nasymptotic series, already on the brink of its maximum predictive power (at\n$z=0$). Hence, the inclusion of higher orders will likely deteriorate the\nmatching to data, even at moderate values of $k$. Part of the reason for this\nbehavior is due to large contributions to the (renormalized) power spectrum at\nthree loop order from mildly non-linear scales, even after the UV counter-terms\nare included. In conclusion, the EFTofLSS to three loop orders provides the\nbest approximation to the (deterministic part of the) power spectrum in the\nweakly non-linear regime at $z=0$, and higher loops are not expected to improve\nour level of accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 18:03:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 13:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

To understand subtle and precise actions within a long time\nperiod, second-order information (e.g. feature covariance) or higher is\nreported to be effective in the literature. However, extracting such high-order\ninformation is considerably non-trivial. In particular, the dimensionality\nincreases exponentially with the information order, and hence gaining more\nrepresentation power also increases the computational cost and the risk of\noverfitting. In this paper, we propose an approach to representing high-order\ninformation for temporal action segmentation via a simple yet effective\nbilinear form. Specifically, our contributions are: (1) From the multilinear\nperspective, we derive a bilinear form of low complexity, assuming that the\nthree-way tensor has low-rank frontal slices. (2) Rather than learning the\ntensor entries from data, we sample the entries from different underlying\ndistributions, and prove that the underlying distribution influences the\ninformation order. (3) We employed our bilinear form as an intermediate layer\nin state-of-the-art deep neural networks, enabling to represent high-order\ninformation in complex deep models effectively and efficiently. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed bilinear form outperforms\nthe previous state-of-the-art methods on the challenging temporal action\nsegmentation task.

One way\nto avoid frame-based human annotation is the use of action order information to\nlearn the respective action classes. In this context, we propose a hierarchical\napproach to address the problem of weakly supervised learning of human actions\nfrom ordered action labels by structuring recognition in a coarse-to-fine\nmanner. Given a set of videos and an ordered list of the occurring actions, the\ntask is to infer start and end frames of the related action classes within the\nvideo and to train the respective action classifiers without any need for hand\nlabeled frame boundaries. We address this problem by combining a framewise RNN\nmodel with a coarse probabilistic inference. This combination allows for the\ntemporal alignment of long sequences and thus, for an iterative training of\nboth elements. While this system alone already generates good results, we show\nthat the performance can be further improved by approximating the number of\nsubactions to the characteristics of the different action classes as well as by\nthe introduction of a regularizing length prior.

We first apply rotational splitting theory to\nthe star's variable signal observed in short-cadence \\emph{Kepler} photometry\nto constrain KOI-976's obliquity angle, and then subtract off variability from\nthat dataset using the linear algorithm for significance reduction software\n{\\tt LASR}. We perform gravity-darkened fits to \\emph{Kepler}\nvariability-subtracted short-cadence photometry and to \\emph{Kepler's}\nphase-folded long-cadence photometry to obtain two more measurements of the\nstar's obliquity. We find that the binary system transits in a grazing\nconfiguration with measured obliquity values of $36^\\circ\\pm17^\\circ$,\n$46^\\circ\\pm16^\\circ$, and $43^\\circ\\pm20^\\circ$ respectively for the three\nmeasurements.

The Mechanism allows for lightning\ninitiation by either of two observed types of events: a high power VHF event\nsuch as a Narrow Bipolar Event, or a weak VHF event. According to the\nMechanism, both types of initiating events are caused by a group of\nrelativistic runaway electron avalanche particles (where the initial electrons\nare secondary particles of an extensive air shower) passing through many\nEth-volumes, thereby causing the nearly simultaneous launching of many positive\nstreamer flashes.

Often the segmentation method has\nto rely purely on edges between the background and foreground making the\nanalyzed images essentially silhouette images. Therefore, to segment the\nobjects, the method needs to be able to resolve the overlaps between multiple\nobjects by utilizing prior information about the shape of the objects. This\npaper introduces a novel method for segmentation of clustered partially\noverlapping convex objects in silhouette images. The proposed method involves\nthree main steps: pre-processing, contour evidence extraction, and contour\nestimation. Contour evidence extraction starts by recovering contour segments\nfrom a binarized image by detecting concave points. After this, the contour\nsegments which belong to the same objects are grouped. The grouping is\nformulated as a combinatorial optimization problem and solved using the branch\nand bound algorithm. Finally, the full contours of the objects are estimated by\na Gaussian process regression method. The experiments on a challenging dataset\nconsisting of nanoparticles demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms\nthree current state-of-art approaches in overlapping convex objects\nsegmentation.

In large ensembles, their\ncontrol and detection via magnetic resonance is widely exploited, e.g. in\nchemistry, medicine, materials science and mining. Nuclear spins also featured\nin early ideas and demonstrations of quantum information processing. Scaling up\nthese ideas requires controlling individual nuclei, which can be detected when\ncoupled to an electron. However, the need to address the nuclei via oscillating\nmagnetic fields complicates their integration in multi-spin nanoscale devices,\nbecause the field cannot be localized or screened. Control via electric fields\nwould resolve this problem, but previous methods relied upon transducing\nelectric signals into magnetic fields via the electron-nuclear hyperfine\ninteraction, which severely affects the nuclear coherence. Here we demonstrate\nthe coherent quantum control of a single antimony (spin-7/2) nucleus, using\nlocalized electric fields produced within a silicon nanoelectronic device. The\nmethod exploits an idea first proposed in 1961 but never realized\nexperimentally with a single nucleus.

These\nresults show that high-spin quadrupolar nuclei could be deployed as chaotic\nmodels, strain sensors and hybrid spin-mechanical quantum systems using\nall-electrical controls.

None of them\ncan capture the long-range van der Waals (vdW) attraction between separated\nsubsystems, but they differ remarkably in the extent to which they capture\nintermediate-range vdW effects responsible for equilibrium bonds between\nneighboring small closed-shell subsystems. The local density approximation\n(LDA) often overestimates this effect, while the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)\ngeneralized gradient approximation (GGA) underestimates it. The\nstrongly-constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA often estimates\nit well. All of these semi-local functionals require an additive non-local\ncorrection such as the revised Vydrov-Van Voorhis 2010 (rVV10) to capture the\nlong-range part. This work reports adsorption energies and the corresponding\ngeometry of the aromatic thiophene (C$_4$H$_4$S) bound to transition metal\nsurfaces. The adsorption process requires a genuine interplay of covalent and\nweak binding and requires a simultaneously accurate description of surface and\nadsorption energies with the correct prediction of the adsorption site. All\nthese quantities must come from well balanced short and long-range correlation\neffects for a universally applicable method for weak interactions with chemical\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 21:45:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 22:32:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

In this work, we consider a data-mining approach to\nenhance the GPS signal. We build a large-scale high precision GPS receiver grid\nsystem to collect real-time GPS signals for training. The Gaussian Process (GP)\nregression is chosen to model the vertical Total Electron Content (vTEC)\ndistribution of the ionosphere of the Earth. Our experiments show that the\nnoise in the real-time GPS signals often exceeds the breakdown point of the\nconventional robust regression methods resulting in sub-optimal system\nperformance. We propose a three-step approach to address this challenge. In the\nfirst step we perform a set of signal validity tests to separate the signals\ninto clean and dirty groups. In the second step, we train an initial model on\nthe clean signals and then reweigting the dirty signals based on the residual\nerror. A final model is retrained on both the clean signals and the reweighted\ndirty signals.

The\norigin and characteristics of many chromospheric features are, because of this,\nunresolved. We focus here on studying two prominent features: long fibrils and\nflare ribbons. To model them, we use a 3D MHD simulation of an active region\nwhich self-consistently reproduces both of them. We model the H$\\alpha$, Mg II\nk, Ca II K, and Ca II 8542 {\\AA} lines using the 3D non-LTE radiative transfer\ncode Multi3D.\n  This simulation reproduces long fibrils that span between the\nopposite-polarity sunspots and go up to 4 Mm in height. They can be traced in\nall lines due to density corrugation. Opposite to previous studies, H$\\alpha$,\nMg II h&k, and Ca II H&K, are formed at similar height in this model. Magnetic\nfield lines are aligned with the H$\\alpha$ fibrils, but the latter holds to a\nlesser extent for the Ca II 8542 {\\AA} line.\n  The simulation shows structures in the H$\\alpha$ line core that look like\nflare ribbons. The emission in the ribbons is caused by a dense chromosphere\nand a transition region at high column mass. The ribbons are visible in all\nchromospheric lines, but least prominent in Ca II 8542 {\\AA} line. In some\npixels, broad asymmetric profiles with a single emission peak are produced,\nsimilar to the profiles observed in flare ribbons. They are caused by a deep\nonset of the chromospheric temperature rise and large velocity gradients.\n  The simulation produces long fibrils similar to what is seen in observations.\nIt also produces structures similar to flare ribbons despite the lack of\nnon-thermal electrons in the simulation. The latter suggests that thermal\nconduction might be a significant agent in transporting flare energy to the\nchromosphere in addition to non-thermal electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 22:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

Examples\nof its use include the assessment of collaborative problem solving, or the\nevaluation of intra-team dynamics. The dIRT model generalizes both Item\nResponse Theory (IRT) models for measurement and the Social Relations Model\n(SRM) for dyadic data. The responses of an actor when paired with a partner are\nmodeled as a function of not only the actor's inclination to act and the\npartner's tendency to elicit that action, but also the unique relationship of\nthe pair, represented by two directional, possibly correlated, interaction\nlatent variables. Generalizations are discussed, such as accommodating triads\nor larger groups. Estimation is performed using Markov-chain Monte Carlo\nimplemented in Stan, making it straightforward to extend the dIRT model in\nvarious ways. Specifically, we show how the basic dIRT model can be extended to\naccommodate latent regressions, multilevel settings with cluster-level random\neffects, as well as joint modeling of dyadic data and a distal outcome.

For the Gaia hypothesis to be\nviable, life must be able to keep the conditions of its host planet habitable,\neven in the face of these challenges. ExoGaia, a model created to investigate\nthe Gaia hypothesis, has been previously used to demonstrate that a randomly\nmutating biosphere is in some cases capable of maintaining planetary\nhabitability.

To see how life responds to climate\nperturbations to its host planet, we created three climate perturbations in\nExoGaia: one rapid cooling of a planet and two heating events, one rapid and\none gradual. The planets on which Gaian feedbacks emerge without climate\nperturbations are the same planets on which life is most likely to survive each\nof our perturbation scenarios. Biospheres experiencing gradual changes to the\nenvironment are able to survive changes of larger magnitude than those\nexperiencing rapid perturbations, and the magnitude of change matters more than\nthe sign.

Instead, we suggest a simple heuristic that an external\nobserver might use to identify which nodes are not credible based upon their\ninvolvement with particular implicating edge motifs. Building on these notions,\nand analogously to some models of structural balance, we develop a discrete\ntime dynamical system where nodes engage in implication avoiding dynamics,\nwhere inconsistent arrangements of edges that cause a node to look 'suspicious'\nexert pressure for that node to change edges.

The mathematics\nbehind is to solve a dynamic constrained optimization problem. Traditional\nmethods like finite difference and forward sensitivity analysis require\ncomputational cost that increases linearly with the number of parameters times\nnumber of cost functions. Discrete adjoint sensitivity analysis (SA) is gaining\npopularity due to its computational efficiency. This algorithm requires a\nforward run followed by a backward run who involves integrating adjoint\nequation backward in time. This was done by doing one forward solve and store\nthe snapshot by checkpointing. Using the checkpoint data, the adjoint equation\nis numerically integrated. The computational cost of this algorithm only\ndepends on the number of cost functions and does not depend on the number of\nparameters. The algorithm is highly powerful when the parameter space is large,\nand in our case of heterogeneous permeability the number of parameters is\nproportional to the number of grid cells. The aim of this project is to\nimplement the discrete sensitivity analysis method in parallel to solve\nrealistic subsurface problems. To achieve this goal, we propose to implement\nthe algorithm in parallel using data structures such as TSAdjoint and TAO.

A joint analysis of redshift-space distortions\n(such as those probed by CMASS from SDSS) and a galaxy-galaxy lensing\nmeasurement for an equivalent sample from DES can provide powerful cosmological\nconstraints. Unfortunately, the DES and SDSS-BOSS footprints have only minimal\noverlap, primarily on the celestial equator near the SDSS Stripe 82 region.\nUsing this overlap, we build a robust Bayesian model to select CMASS-like\ngalaxies in the remainder of the DES footprint.

Two types\nof models are considered: First, a continuum model, wherein the individual\nparticulate sources are not resolved and the heat release is assumed spatially\nuniform, is solved via conventional finite difference techniques. Second, a\ndiscrete source model, wherein the heat diffusion from individual sources is\nmodeled via superposition of the Green's function of each source, is employed\nto examine the influence of the random, discrete nature of the media. Heat\ntransfer to cold, isothermal walls and to a layer of inert gas surrounding the\nreactive medium are considered as the loss mechanisms. Both cylindrical and\nrectangular (slab) geometries of the reactive medium are considered, and the\nflame speed is measured as a function of the diameter and thickness of the\ndomains, respectively. In the continuum model with inert gas confinement, a\nuniversal scaling of critical diameter to critical thickness near 2:1 is found.\nIn the discrete source model, as the time scale of heat release of the sources\nis made small compared to the interparticle diffusion time, the geometric\nscaling between cylinders and slabs exhibits values greater than 2:1. The\nability of the flame in the discrete regime to propagate in thinner slabs than\npredicted by continuum scaling is attributed to the flame being able to exploit\nlocal fluctuations in concentration across the slab to sustain propagation. As\nthe heat release time of the sources is increased, the discrete source model\nreverts back to results consistent with the continuum model.

We identify a region in parameter space for which the\nevent rate always involves a dip and another one for which this is never the\ncase.

In our model, Defender (DF) has locks and Attacker\n(AT) has bombs to allocate among sites, trying to destroy these sites. One or\nmore bombs can be placed into the same site. A site is destroyed if at least\none explosion occurs. A lock is a protection device which, placed in a site,\nprevents its destruction with any number of bombs in it. The important feature\nof the model is that AT can and will test every site, trying to find sites\nwithout locks. This testing is not perfect: a test of a site may have a\npositive result, even if there is no lock at the site, or a negative result,\neven if there is a lock. The probabilities of correct identification of both\ntypes (sensitivity and specificity) are known to both players. In the Bayesian\nsetting we assume that the probability distribution of the locks is known to\nAT, although the actual positions of the locks are not. After the locks are\nallocated, AT receives the test results, and distributes the bombs among the\nsites, trying to maximize the expected sum of values of all destroyed sites.\nThe goal of DF is to select a prior distribution of locks to minimize this\nloss. Some special cases of this game are completely solved, and some partial\nresults are obtained for the general model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 16:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

So far, this regime has been\nrarely accessed and systematic studies are much needed to advance the field.\nHere we demonstrate the control of topology in a heavy fermion system. We use\nmagnetic field to manipulate Weyl nodes in a Weyl-Kondo semimetal [6-8], up to\nthe point where they annihilate in a topological quantum phase transition. The\nsuppression of the topological characteristics occurs in an intact and only\nweakly varying strongly correlated \"background\". Thus, topology is changing per\nse and not as a consequence of a change of the correlation state, for instance\nacross a magnetic, electronic or structural phase transition. Our demonstration\nof genuine topology tuning in a strongly correlated electron system sets the\nstage for establishing global phase diagrams of topology, an approach that has\nproven highly valuable to explore and understand topologically trivial strongly\ncorrelated electron systems [1-4].

The median peculiar velocity is 11 km/s,\nsignificantly smaller than classical `runaway star' velocities. Mass-loss rates\nfor these O and early B stars agree with recently lowered theoretical\npredictions, ranging from ~10^-7 Msun/yr for mid-O dwarfs to 10^-9 Msun/yr for\nlate-O dwarfs---a factor of about 2.7 lower than the often-used Vink et al.\n(2001) formulation. Our results provide the first observational mass-loss rates\nfor B0--B3 dwarfs and giants---10^-9 to 10^-8 Msun/yr. We find evidence for an\nincrease in the mass-loss rates below a critical effective temperature,\nconsistent with predictions of the bi-stability phenomenon in the range\nTeff=19,000--27,000 K. The sample exhibits a correlation between modified wind\nmomentum and luminosity, consistent in slope but lower by 0.43 dex in magnitude\ncompared to canonical wind-luminosity relations. We identify a small subset of\nobjects deviating most significantly from theoretical expectations as probable\nradiation-driven bow wave nebulae by virtue of their low stellar-to-nebular\nluminosity ratios. For these, the inferred mass-loss rates must be regarded as\nupper limits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2019 05:33:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

By replacing pooling/striding with dilation in\nconvolution layers, they can preserve high-resolution information and still\nreach distant locations. Producing high-resolution predictions is also crucial\nin music source separation, whose goal is to separate different sound sources\nwhile maintaining the quality of the separated sounds. Therefore, this paper\ninvestigates using stacked dilated convolutions as the backbone for music\nsource separation. However, while stacked dilated convolutions can reach wider\ncontext than standard convolutions, their effective receptive fields are still\nfixed and may not be wide enough for complex music audio signals. To reach\ninformation at remote locations, we propose to combine dilated convolution with\na modified version of gated recurrent units (GRU) called the `Dilated GRU' to\nform a block. A Dilated GRU unit receives information from k steps before\ninstead of the previous step for a fixed k. This modification allows a GRU unit\nto reach a location with fewer recurrent steps and run faster because it can\nexecute partially in parallel. We show that the proposed model with a stack of\nsuch blocks performs equally well or better than the state-of-the-art models\nfor separating vocals and accompaniments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2019 05:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

However,\nthere is limited understanding of how graph convolution affects clustering\nperformance and how to properly use it to optimize performance for different\ngraphs. Existing methods essentially use graph convolution of a fixed and low\norder that only takes into account neighbours within a few hops of each node,\nwhich underutilizes node relations and ignores the diversity of graphs.

However, the learning speed of the traditional contextual\nbandit algorithms is often slow due to the need for extensive exploration. This\nposes a critical issue in applications like recommender systems, since users\nmay need to provide feedbacks on a lot of uninterested items. To accelerate the\nlearning speed, we generalize contextual bandit to conversational contextual\nbandit. Conversational contextual bandit leverages not only behavioral\nfeedbacks on arms (e.g., articles in news recommendation), but also occasional\nconversational feedbacks on key-terms from the user. Here, a key-term can\nrelate to a subset of arms, for example, a category of articles in news\nrecommendation. We then design the Conversational UCB algorithm (ConUCB) to\naddress two challenges in conversational contextual bandit: (1) which key-terms\nto select to conduct conversation, (2) how to leverage conversational feedbacks\nto accelerate the speed of bandit learning. We theoretically prove that ConUCB\ncan achieve a smaller regret upper bound than the traditional contextual bandit\nalgorithm LinUCB, which implies a faster learning speed. Experiments on\nsynthetic data, as well as real datasets from Yelp and Toutiao, demonstrate the\nefficacy of the ConUCB algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2019 06:31:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 09:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

I also obtain more precise metallicity\nestimates using priors from the $Gaia$ parallaxes for relatively nearby stars.\nClose to the Galactic mid-plane ($|Z|<2$ kpc), a mean metallicity map reveals\ndeviations from the mirror symmetry between the northern and southern\nhemispheres, displaying wave-like oscillations. The observed metallicity\nasymmetry structure is almost parallel to the Galactic mid-plane, and coincides\nwith the previously known asymmetry in the stellar number density distribution.\nThis result reinforces the previous notion of the plane-parallel vertical waves\npropagating through the disk, in which a local metallicity perturbation from\nthe mean vertical metallicity gradient is induced by the phase-space wrapping\nof stars in the $Z$-$V_Z$ plane.

In\nhigh critical temperature superconductors, where electronic correlation is the\nmain actor, the actual role of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is being\nintensely debated theoretically and investigated experimentally. We present an\nin-depth study of how the EPC strength can be obtained directly from resonant\ninelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) data through the theoretical approach derived\nby Ament et al.

Most existing methods resort\nto first detecting objects and their relationships, and then generating textual\ndescriptions, which heavily depends on pre-trained detectors and leads to\nperformance drop when facing problems of heavy occlusion, tiny-size objects and\nlong-tail in object detection. In addition, the separate procedure of detecting\nand captioning results in semantic inconsistency between the pre-defined\nobject/relation categories and the target lexical words. We exploit prior human\ncommonsense knowledge for reasoning relationships between objects without any\npre-trained detectors and reaching semantic coherency within one image or video\nin captioning. The prior knowledge (e.g., in the form of knowledge graph)\nprovides commonsense semantic correlation and constraint between objects that\nare not explicit in the image and video, serving as useful guidance to build\nsemantic graph for sentence generation. Particularly, we present a joint\nreasoning method that incorporates 1) commonsense reasoning for embedding image\nor video regions into semantic space to build semantic graph and 2) relational\nreasoning for encoding semantic graph to generate sentences. Extensive\nexperiments on the MS-COCO image captioning benchmark and the MSVD video\ncaptioning benchmark validate the superiority of our method on leveraging prior\ncommonsense knowledge to enhance relational reasoning for visual captioning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2019 09:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

With this insight, we design a novel Dispersion-based\nClustering (DBC) approach which can discover the underlying patterns in data.\nThis approach considers a wider context of sample-level pairwise relationships\nto achieve a robust cluster affinity assessment which handles the complications\nmay arise due to prevalent imbalanced data distributions. Additionally, our\nsolution can automatically prioritize standalone data points and prevents\ninferior clustering. Our extensive experimental analysis on image and video\nre-identification benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a significant margin.

In this way, the signature of a UPO can be identified in a short\ntime series without the need for a near recurrence to occur, which is a\nconsiderable drawback to recurrent flow analysis, the current state-of-the-art.\nWe first demonstrate the method by applying it to a known (simple) UPO and find\nthat the period can be reliably extracted even for time windows of length one\nquarter of the full period. We then turn to a long turbulent trajectory,\nsliding an observation window through the time series and performing many DMD\ncomputations.

Furthermore, it also yields converged UPOs at points where the\nrecurrent flow analysis flagged a near recurrence but the Newton solver did not\nconverge, suggesting that the new approach can be used alongside the old to\ngenerate improved initial guesses.

Here, we investigate what fraction of GRBs have spectra that are\nconsistent with emission from a photopshere in a non-dissipative outflow. This\nis the simplest possible photospheric emission scenario. We create synthetic\nspectra, with a range of peak energies, by folding the theoretical predictions\nthrough the detector response of the FERMI/GBM detector.

Existing face parsing literature\nhave illustrated significant advantages by focusing on individual regions of\ninterest (RoIs) for faces and facial components. However, the traditional\ncrop-and-resize focusing mechanism ignores all contextual area outside the\nRoIs, and thus is not suitable when the component area is unpredictable, e.g.\nhair. Inspired by the physiological vision system of human, we propose a novel\nRoI Tanh-warping operator that combines the central vision and the peripheral\nvision together. It addresses the dilemma between a limited sized RoI for\nfocusing and an unpredictable area of surrounding context for peripheral\ninformation. To this end, we propose a novel hybrid convolutional neural\nnetwork for face parsing. It uses hierarchical local based method for inner\nfacial components and global methods for outer facial components. The whole\nframework is simple and principled, and can be trained end-to-end.

As CFI\nis being adopted by commodity software (e.g., Windows and Android) and\ncommodity hardware (e.g., Intel's CET and ARM's BTI), the CFI information\nbecomes readily available through the hardware CFI extensions. With the CFI\ninformation, we apply CFI principles to also constrain illegal control-flow\nduring speculative execution. Specifically, our proposed defense, SPECCFI,\nensures that control flow instructions target legal destinations to constrain\ndangerous speculation on forward control-flow paths (indirect calls and\nbranches). We augment this protection with a precise speculation-aware hardware\nstack to constrain speculation on backward control-flow edges (returns). We\ncombine this solution with existing solutions against branch target predictor\nattacks (Spectre-PHT) to close all known non-vendor-specific Spectre\nvulnerabilities. We show that SPECCFI results in small overheads both in terms\nof performance and additional hardware complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2019 11:05:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 21:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-06"}

However, they explain a large part of the heterogeneity in a field\nand may have longer-term consequences, especially in mixed stands. Modeling can\nhelp to better understand these phenomena but requires simulating the\ninteractions between different individuals. In the case of large populations,\nassessing the parameters of a heterogeneous population model from experimental\ndata is intractable computationally. This paper investigates the mean-field\napproximation of large dynamical systems with random initial conditions and\nindividual parameters, and with interaction being represented by pairwise\npotentials between individuals. Under this approximation, each individual is in\ninteraction with an infinitely-crowded population, summarized by a probability\nmeasure, the mean-field limit distribution, being itself the weak solution of a\nnon-linear hyperbolic partial differential equation. In particular, the\nphenomenon of chaos propagation implies that the individuals are independent\nasymptotically when the size of the population tends towards infinity. This\nresult provides perspectives for a possible simplification of the inference\nproblem. The simulation of the mean-field distribution, consisting in a\nsemi-Lagrangian scheme with an interpolation step using Gaussian process\nregression, is illustrated for a heterogeneous population model representing\nplants in competition for light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2019 12:16:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

In optical remote\nsensing application, a prevalent mechanism is to fine-tune on an existing model\npre-trained with a large-scale natural image dataset, such as ImageNet.\nHowever, this scheme does not achieve satisfactory performance for SAR\napplication because of the prominent discrepancy between SAR and optical\nimages.

Several experiments\nare conducted on OpenSARShip.

We\nre-visit the question of the depletion of the elements incorporated into the\ncarbonaceous component of interstellar dust, i.e., C, H, O, N and S, in the\nlight of recent analyses of the organics in comets, meteorites and\ninterplanetary dust particles. We find that oxygen could be combined with ~ 10\nto 20 % of the carbon in the dust in dense regions in the form of a difficult\nto observe, organic carbonate, which could explain the unaccounted for 170-255\nppm oxygen depletion. We conclude that, while C, O and N atoms are depleted\ninto an amorphous a-C:H:O:N phase, we posit that a significant fraction of C\nand O atoms could be sequestered into an organic carbonate, which provides a\nviable solution to the oxygen depletion problem. Further, the thermal or\nphotolytic decomposition of this carbonate may have a bearing on the formation\nof CO_2 in the ISM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2019 12:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

The interaction between low-mass companions and the debris discs\nthey reside in is still not fully understood. A debris disc can evolve due to\nself-stirring, a process in which planetesimals can excite their neighbours to\nthe point of destructive collisions. In addition, the presence of a companion\ncould further stir the disc (companion-stirring). Additional information is\nnecessary to understand this fundamental step in the formation and evolution of\na planetary system, and at the moment of writing only a handful of systems are\nknown where a companion and a debris disc have both been detected and studied\nat the same time.\n  Aims. Our primary goal is to augment the sample of these systems and to\nunderstand the relative importance between self-stirring and\ncompanion-stirring.\n  Methods. In the course of the VLT/NaCo Imaging Survey for Planets around\nYoung stars (ISPY), we observed HD 193571, an A0 debris disc hosting star at a\ndistance of 68 pc with an age between 60 and 170 Myr.

We discovered a previously unknown M-dwarf companion around HD\n193571, making it the third low-mass stellar object discovered within a debris\ndisc.

If a generated input at\nthe system level causes a failure, this is a true alarm, as the input could\nalso have come from the user or a third party; but system testing is much\nslower.\n  In this paper, we introduce the concept of a test generation bridge, which\njoins the accuracy of system testing with the speed of unit testing. A Test\nGeneration Bridge allows to combine an arbitrary system test generator with an\narbitrary unit test generator. It does so by carving parameterized unit tests\nfrom system (test) executions. These unit tests run in a context recorded from\nthe system test, but individual parameters are left free for the unit test\ngenerator to systematically explore. This allows symbolic test generators such\nas KLEE to operate on individual functions in the recorded system context. If\nthe test generator detects a failure, we lift the failure-inducing parameter\nback to the system input; if the failure can be reproduced at the system level,\nit is reported as a true alarm.

Although the\nassumption was lifted in subsequent work using negative momentum, this\nintroduced a new parameter and required knowledge of strong convexity and\nsmoothness constants, which is rarely possible in practice. We rehabilitate the\nmethod by introducing a new variant that needs only smoothness constant and\ndoes not have any extra parameters. Furthermore, when removing the strong\nconvexity constant from the stepsize, we present a new analysis of the method,\nwhich no longer uses the assumption that every component is strongly convex.\nThis allows us to also obtain so far unknown nonconvex convergence of MISO. To\nmake the proposed method efficient in practice, we derive minibatching bounds\nwith arbitrary uniform sampling that lead to linear speedup when the expected\nminibatch size is in a certain range. Our numerical experiments show that MISO\nis a serious competitor to SAGA and SVRG and sometimes outperforms them on real\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2019 14:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

We present a solution to these questions that can be summed up in two\nwords; false structures. Indeed, deep learning does not learn the original\nstructures that humans use when recognising images (cats have whiskers, paws,\nfur, pointy ears, etc), but rather different false structures that correlate\nwith the original structure and hence yield the success. However, the false\nstructure, unlike the original structure, is unstable. The false structure is\nsimpler than the original structure, hence easier to learn with less data and\nthe numerical algorithm used in the training will more easily converge to the\nneural network that captures the false structure. We formally define the\nconcept of false structures and formulate the solution as a conjecture. Given\nthat trained neural networks always are computed with approximations, this\nconjecture can only be established through a combination of theoretical and\ncomputational results similar to how one establishes a postulate in theoretical\nphysics (e.g. the speed of light is constant). Establishing the conjecture\nfully will require a vast research program characterising the false structures.\nWe provide the foundations for such a program establishing the existence of the\nfalse structures in practice.

Our\nidea is to define a discrete neighborhood of the current SGD point containing a\nnumber of \"potentially good moves\" that exploit gradient information, and to\nsearch this neighborhood by using a classical metaheuristic scheme borrowed\nfrom Discrete Optimization.\n  In the present paper we investigate the use of a simple Simulated Annealing\n(SA) metaheuristic that accepts/rejects a candidate new solution in the\nneighborhood with a probability that depends both on the new solution quality\nand on a parameter (the temperature) which is modified over time to lower the\nprobability of accepting worsening moves. We use this scheme as an automatic\nway to perform hyper-parameter tuning, hence the title of the paper. A\ndistinctive feature of our scheme is that hyper-parameters are modified within\na single SGD execution (and not in an external loop, as customary) and\nevaluated on the fly on the current minibatch, i.e., their tuning is fully\nembedded within the SGD algorithm.\n  The use of SA for training is not new, but previous proposals were mainly\nintended for non-differentiable objective functions for which SGD is not\napplied due to the lack of gradients. On the contrary, our SA method requires\ndifferentiability of (a proxy of) the loss function, and leverages on the\navailability of a gradient direction to define local moves that have a large\nprobability to improve the current solution.\n  Computational results on image classification (CIFAR-10) are reported,\nshowing that the proposed approach leads to an improvement of the final\nvalidation accuracy for modern Deep Neural Networks such as ResNet34 and VGG16.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2019 15:14:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

Moreover, our\napproach reveals a correspondence between two different interpretations of the\nFrobenius equations on string diagrams and two synchronisation mechanisms for\nprocesses, \\`a la Hoare and \\`a la Milner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2019 15:31:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 09:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

The latter\ntask is challenging, due to its intricate non-local nature, which calls for\nadditional supervision. We mitigate this by descending the deep layers of a\npre-trained network, where the deep features contain more semantics, and\napplying the translation from and between these deep features.

As a result, in the grand\nscheme of things, mathematical models have so far played an auxiliary role in\nbiomedical sciences. We propose a new methodology allowing mathematical\nmodeling to give, in certain cases, definitive answers to systemic biomedical\nquestions that elude empirical resolution. Our methodology is based on two\nideas: (1) employing mathematical models that are firmly rooted in established\nbiomedical knowledge yet so general that they can account for any, or at least\nmany, biological mechanisms, both known and unknown; (2) finding model\nparameters whose likelihood-maximizing values are independent of observations\n(existence of such parameters implies that the model must not meet regularity\nconditions required for the consistency of maximum likelihood estimator). These\nuniversal parameter values may reveal general patterns (that we call natural\nlaws) in biomedical processes. We illustrate this approach with the discovery\nof a clinically important natural law governing cancer metastasis.\nSpecifically, we found that under minimal, and fairly realistic, mathematical\nand biomedical assumptions the likelihood-maximizing scenario of metastatic\ncancer progression in an individual patient is invariably the same: Complete\nsuppression of metastatic growth before primary tumor resection followed by an\nabrupt growth acceleration after surgery. This scenario is widely observed in\nclinical practice and supported by a wealth of experimental studies on animals\nand clinical case reports published over the last 110 years. The above most\nlikely scenario does not preclude other possibilities e.g. metastases may start\naggressive growth before primary tumor resection or remain dormant after\nsurgery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 18:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-06"}

This project addresses these problems in three steps.\nFirst, the code for the builtin functions is moved from the simulator into a\nlibrary from where relevant parts, determined by information in the bytecode\nfile, are linked into the runtime system at load time. Second, information is\nassociated with each library function about how it can be invoked from a\n$\\lambda$Prolog program and where the C code for it is to be found. Finally,\nthe compiler is modified to use the preceding information to include relevant\nlinking instructions in the bytecode file and to translate invocations to\nbuiltin relations into a special instruction that calls the dynamically linked\ncode. More generally, these ideas are capable of supporting an interface in\n$\\lambda$Prolog to \"foreign functions\" implemented in C, a possibility that is\nalso discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 19:32:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}
