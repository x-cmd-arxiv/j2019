Within this\nspectrum gamma oscillations have received particular attention due to their\nubiquitous nature and to their correlation with higher brain functions.\nRecently, it has been reported that gamma oscillations in the hippocampus of\nbehaving rodents are segregated in two distinct frequency bands: slow and fast.\nThese two gamma rhythms correspond to dfferent states of the network, but their\norigin has been not yet clarified. Here, we show theoretically and numerically\nthat a single inhibitory population can give rise to coexisting slow and fast\ngamma rhythms corresponding to collective oscillations of a balanced spiking\nnetwork. The slow and fast gamma rhythms are generated via two different\nmechanisms: the fast one being driven by the coordinated tonic neural firing\nand the slow one by endogenous fluctuations due to irregular neural activity.\nWe show that almost instantaneous stimulations can switch the collective gamma\noscillations from slow to fast and vice versa. Furthermore, to make a closer\ncontact with the experimental observations, we consider the modulation of the\ngamma rhythms induced by a slower (theta) rhythm driving the network dynamics.\nIn this context, depending on the strength of the forcing, we observe\nphase-amplitude and phase-phase coupling between the fast and slow gamma\noscillations and the theta forcing. Phase-phase coupling reveals different\ntheta-phases preferences for the two coexisting gamma rhythms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2019 16:09:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

With a growing awareness of\nlong-term mass surveillance programs by governments and others, FS has become\nwidely regarded as a highly desirable property. This is particularly true in\nthe TLS protocol, which is used to secure Internet communication. In this\npaper, we investigate FS in pre-TLS 1.3 protocols, which do not mandate FS, but\nstill widely used today. We conduct an empirical analysis of over 10 million\nTLS servers from three different datasets using a novel heuristic approach.\nUsing a modern TLS client handshake algorithms, our results show 5.37% of top\ndomains, 7.51% of random domains, and 26.16% of random IPs do not select FS\nkey-exchange algorithms. Surprisingly, 39.20% of the top domains, 24.40% of the\nrandom domains, and 14.46% of the random IPs that do not select FS, do support\nFS. In light of this analysis, we discuss possible paths toward forward secure\nInternet traffic. As an improvement of the current state, we propose a new\nclient-side mechanism that we call \"Best Effort Forward Secrecy\" (BEFS), and an\nextension of it that we call \"Best Effort Forward Secrecy and Authenticated\nEncryption\" (BESAFE), which aims to guide (force) misconfigured servers to FS\nusing a best effort approach. Finally, within our analysis, we introduce a\nnovel adversarial model that we call \"discriminatory\" adversary, which is\napplicable to the TLS protocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2019 16:19:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

This paper fills this\ngap by comprehensively evaluating nine state-of-the-art local geometric feature\nrepresentations. Our evaluation is on the ground that ground-truth LRFs are\nleveraged such that the ranking of tested feature representations are more\nconvincing as opposed to existing studies. The experiments are deployed on six\nstandard datasets with various application scenarios (shape retrieval, point\ncloud registration, and object recognition) and data modalities (LiDAR, Kinect,\nand Space Time) as well as perturbations including Gaussian noise, shot noise,\ndata decimation, clutter, occlusion, and limited overlap. The evaluated terms\ncover the major concerns for a feature representation, e.g., distinctiveness,\nrobustness, compactness, and efficiency. The outcomes present interesting\nfindings that may shed new light on this community and provide complementary\nperspectives to existing evaluations on the topic of local geometric feature\ndescription.

Goodness of fit analysis showed that the stoichiometric model\npredicted CH4 production well; normalized mean square error analysis revealed\nthat it surpassed previous models. Comparison of model predictions with field\nmeasurements of CH4 emissions further validated the new model. Importantly, the\nmodel also identified parameters that are currently lacking but are needed to\nenable future robust modeling of CH4 production from OSTP and EPL in situ.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2019 18:08:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-29"}

On very small scales, we observe\nhowever inhomogeneities such as galaxies, stars, planets and ourselves. In the\ncontext of hot Big-Bang cosmology, these inhomogeneities are often explained as\nthe remains of quantum fluctuations at very early times, enlarged to observable\nscales through the process of inflation. In this dissertation, I examine two\nimportant questions surrounding this scenario: a) How do inherently quantal\nfluctuations transition to the observed inhomogeneities, which behave\nclassically? ; and b) If the initial state of the universe was symmetric, how\ncan the currently observed state? This dissertation is organized in three\nparts. Part one first introduces the slow-roll inflation model and then\ndiscusses the behavior of small (scalar) perturbations to this model. The\nsecond part investigates various answers provided to the questions above,\nstarting with some general observations on the classical limit of quantum\nmechanics with special attention given to the inverted harmonic oscillator. The\nformalisms of `squeezing' and decoherence are discussed and weak points are\npointed out. In the final part, I examine in detail the pilot-wave approach to\nthe problem, discussing in detail the classical limit of the theory and how\npilot-wave theory addresses both questions above. Numerical results for\npilot-wave trajectories are presented, illustrating directly the classical\nlimit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2019 18:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

Under the standard paradigm of network\nfine-tuning, an entirely new CNN is learned per task, and the final network\nsize is independent of task complexity. This is wasteful, since simple tasks\nrequire smaller networks than more complex tasks, and limits the number of\ntasks that can be solved simultaneously. To address these problems, we propose\na transfer learning procedure, denoted NetTailor, in which layers of a\npre-trained CNN are used as universal blocks that can be combined with small\ntask-specific layers to generate new networks. Besides minimizing\nclassification error, the new network is trained to mimic the internal\nactivations of a strong unconstrained CNN, and minimize its complexity by the\ncombination of 1) a soft-attention mechanism over blocks and 2) complexity\nregularization constraints. In this way, NetTailor can adapt the network\narchitecture, not just its weights, to the target task. Experiments show that\nnetworks adapted to simple tasks, such as character or traffic sign\nrecognition, become significantly smaller than those adapted to hard tasks,\nsuch as fine-grained recognition. More importantly, due to the modular nature\nof the procedure, this reduction in network complexity is achieved without\ncompromise of either parameter sharing across tasks, or classification\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2019 20:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

Resistive crossbars\noffer a highly-parallel and efficient matrix-vector-multiplication (MVM)\noperation. MVM being the most dominant operation in DNNs makes crossbars\nideally suited. However, various sources of device and circuit non-idealities\nlead to errors in the MVM output, thereby reducing DNN accuracy. Towards that\nend, we propose crossbar re-mapping strategies to mitigate line-resistance\ninduced accuracy degradation in DNNs, without having to re-train the learned\nweights, unlike most prior works. Line-resistances degrade the voltage levels\nalong the crossbar columns, thereby inducing more errors at the columns away\nfrom the drivers.

The choice of distance metric has a fundamental impact on\nperformance of these procedures, raising questions about how to appropriately\ncalculate distances. When data points are real-valued vectors, by far the most\ncommon choice is the Euclidean distance. This article is focused on the problem\nof how to better calculate distances taking into account the intrinsic geometry\nof the data, assuming data are concentrated near an unknown subspace or\nmanifold. The appropriate geometric distance corresponds to the length of the\nshortest path along the manifold, which is the geodesic distance. When the\nmanifold is unknown, it is challenging to accurately approximate the geodesic\ndistance. Current algorithms are either highly complex, and hence often\nimpractical to implement, or based on simple local linear approximations and\nshortest path algorithms that may have inadequate accuracy. We propose a simple\nand general alternative, which uses pieces of spheres, or spherelets, to\nlocally approximate the unknown subspace and thereby estimate the geodesic\ndistance through paths over spheres. Theory is developed showing lower error\nfor many manifolds, with applications in clustering, conditional density\nestimation and mean regression.

This process requires logical operators, acting on protected\nqubits, to be translated into physical operators (circuits) acting on physical\nquantum states. We propose a mathematical framework for synthesizing physical\ncircuits that implement logical Clifford operators for stabilizer codes.\nCircuit synthesis is enabled by representing the desired physical Clifford\noperator in $\\mathbb{C}^{N \\times N}$ as a partial $2m \\times 2m$ binary\nsymplectic matrix, where $N = 2^m$. We state and prove two theorems that use\nsymplectic transvections to efficiently enumerate all binary symplectic\nmatrices that satisfy a system of linear equations. As a corollary of these\nresults, we prove that for an $[\\![ m,k ]\\!]$ stabilizer code every logical\nClifford operator has $2^{r(r+1)/2}$ symplectic solutions, where $r = m-k$, up\nto stabilizer degeneracy. The desired physical circuits are then obtained by\ndecomposing each solution into a product of elementary symplectic matrices,\nthat correspond to elementary circuits. This enumeration of all physical\nrealizations enables optimization over the ensemble with respect to a suitable\nmetric. Furthermore, we show that any circuit that normalizes the stabilizer of\nthe code can be transformed into a circuit that centralizes the stabilizer,\nwhile realizing the same logical operation.

In this paper, we examine 5 distinct behavioral characteristics\nassociated with creativity, and provide an example of a mechanisms from\ngenerative deep learning architectures that give rise to each these\ncharacteristics.

The tissue collected from\npatients that undergo pre-surgical MRI and radical prostatectomy provides a\nunique opportunity to correlate histopathology images of the entire prostate\nwith MRI in order to accurately map the extent of prostate cancer onto MRI.\nHere, we introduce the RAPSODI (framework for the registration of radiology and\npathology images.

Zero-shot learning models rely on\nlearning an embedding space, where both semantic descriptions of classes and\nvisual features of instances can be embedded for nearest neighbor search.\nRecently, most of the existing works consider the visual space formulated by\ndeep visual features as an ideal choice of the embedding space. However, the\ndiscrete distribution of instances in the visual space makes the data structure\nunremarkable. We argue that optimizing the visual space is crucial as it allows\nsemantic vectors to be embedded into the visual space more effectively. In this\nwork, we propose two strategies to accomplish this purpose. One is the visual\nprototype based method, which learns a visual prototype for each visual class,\nso that, in the visual space, a class can be represented by a prototype feature\ninstead of a series of discrete visual features. The other is to optimize the\nvisual feature structure in an intermediate embedding space, and in this method\nwe successfully devise a multilayer perceptron framework based algorithm that\nis able to learn the common intermediate embedding space and meanwhile to make\nthe visual data structure more distinctive.

In recent years, approaches based on local features and sparse 3D\npoint-cloud models have both dominated the benchmarks and seen successful\nrealworld deployment. They enable applications ranging from robot navigation,\nautonomous driving, virtual and augmented reality to device geo-localization.\nRecently end-to-end learned localization approaches have been proposed which\nshow promising results on small scale datasets. However the positioning\naccuracy, scalability, latency and compute & storage requirements of these\napproaches remain open challenges. We aim to deploy localization at\nglobal-scale where one thus relies on methods using local features and sparse\n3D models. Our approach spans from offline model building to real-time\nclient-side pose fusion. The system compresses appearance and geometry of the\nscene for efficient model storage and lookup leading to scalability beyond what\nwhat has been previously demonstrated. It allows for low-latency localization\nqueries and efficient fusion run in real-time on mobile platforms by combining\nserver-side localization with real-time visual-inertial-based camera pose\ntracking. In order to further improve efficiency we leverage a combination of\npriors, nearest neighbor search, geometric match culling and a cascaded pose\ncandidate refinement step. This combination outperforms previous approaches\nwhen working with large scale models and allows deployment at unprecedented\nscale. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a proof-of-concept\nsystem localizing 2.5 million images against models from four cities in\ndifferent regions on the world achieving query latencies in the 200ms range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2019 08:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

In calculations of the prediction interval,\nalthough the Higgins-Thompson-Spiegelhalter method is used most often in\npractice, it might not have adequate coverage probability for the true\ntreatment effect of a future study under realistic situations. An effective\nalternative candidate is the Bayesian prediction interval, which has also been\nwidely used in general prediction problems. However, these prediction intervals\nare constructed based on the Bayesian philosophy, and their frequentist\nvalidities are only justified by large-sample approximations even if\nnon-informative priors are adopted. There has been no certain evidence that\nevaluated their frequentist performances under realistic situations of\nmeta-analyses. In this study, we conducted extensive simulation studies to\nassess the frequentist coverage performances of Bayesian prediction intervals\nwith 11 non-informative prior distributions under general meta-analysis\nsettings. Through these simulation studies, we found that frequentist coverage\nperformances strongly depended on what prior distributions were adopted. In\naddition, when the number of studies was smaller than 10, there were no prior\ndistributions that retained accurate frequentist coverage properties. We also\nillustrated these methods via applications to eight real meta-analysis\ndatasets. The resultant prediction intervals also differed according to the\nadopted prior distributions. Inaccurate prediction intervals may provide\ninvalid evidence and misleading conclusions. Thus, if frequentist accuracy is\nrequired, Bayesian prediction intervals should be used cautiously in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2019 09:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

Although most of the time the information lost is\nredundant with respect to the target task, there are still cases where\ndiscriminative information is also discarded. For example, if the samples that\nbelong to the same category have multiple correlated features, the model may\nonly learn a subset of the features and ignore the rest. This may not be a\nproblem unless the classification in the test set highly depends on the ignored\nfeatures. We argue that the discard of the correlated discriminative\ninformation is partially caused by the fact that the minimization of the\nclassification loss doesn't ensure to learn the overall discriminative\ninformation but only the most discriminative information. To address this\nproblem, we propose an information flow maximization (IFM) loss as a\nregularization term to find the discriminative correlated features.

Specifically, the antenna activation pattern in the SCM\ncorresponds to a codeword in a properly designed codebook with a larger minimum\nHamming distance than its counterpart conventional spatial modulation. As the\nminimum Hamming distance increases, the reliability of the active antenna\ndetection is directly enhanced, which in turn improves the demodulation of the\nmodulated symbols and yields a better system reliability. In addition to the\nreliability, the proposed SCM scheme also achieves a higher capacity with the\nidentical antenna configuration compared to the conventional spatial modulation\ntechnique. Moreover, the proposed SCM scheme strikes a balance between spectral\nefficiency and reliability by trading off the minimum Hamming distance with the\nnumber of available codewords. The optimal maximum likelihood detector is first\nformulated. Then, a low-complexity suboptimal detector is proposed to reduce\nthe computational complexity, which has a two-step detection. Theoretical\nderivations of the channel capacity and the bit error rate are presented in\nvarious channel scenarios, i.e., Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami-m, imperfect\nchannel state information, and spatial correlation. Further derivation on\nperformance bounding is also provided to reveal the insight of the benefit of\nincreasing the minimum Hamming distance.

We employ\nstate-of-the-art data processing, velocity and electric field inversion methods\nfor deriving estimates of the energy and helicity injections from these\ndatasets. We find that the electric field inversion methods that reproduce the\nobserved magnetic field evolution through the use of Faraday's law are more\nstable against variable cadence: the PDFI (PTD-Doppler-FLCT-Ideal) electric\nfield inversion method produces consistent injection estimates for cadences\nfrom 2.25 minutes up to 2 hours, implying that the photospheric processes\nacting on time scales below 2 hours contribute little to the injections, or\nthat they are below the sensitivity of the input data and the PDFI method. On\nother hand, the electric field estimate derived from the output of DAVE4VM\n(Differential Affine Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms), which does\nnot fulfil Faraday's law exactly, produces significant variations in the energy\nand helicity injection estimates in the 2.25-minute to 2-hour cadence range. We\npresent also a third, novel DAVE4VM-based electric field estimate, which\ncorrects the poor inductivity of the raw DAVE4VM estimate. This method is less\nsensitive to the changes of cadence, but still faces significant issues for the\nlowest of considered cadences ($\\geq$2 hours). We find several potential\nproblems in both PDFI- and DAVE4VM-based injection estimates and conclude that\nthe quality of both should be surveyed further in controlled environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2019 11:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

The notion of port-Lagrangian systems in nonequilibrium\nthermodynamics is deduced from the variational formulation of nonequilibrium\nthermodynamics developed in Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura [2017a,2017b]. It is a\ntype of Lagrange-d'Alembert principle associated to a specific class of\nnonlinear nonholonomic constraints, called phenomenological constraints, which\nare associated to the entropy production equation of the system. To these\nphenomenological constraints are systematically associated variational\nconstraints, which need to be imposed on the variations considered in the\nprinciple. In this paper, by specifically focusing on the cases of simple\nthermodynamic systems with constraints, we show how the interconnections in\nthermodynamics can be also described by Dirac structures on the Pontryagin\nbundle as well as on the cotangent bundle of the thermodynamic configuration\nspace. Each of these Dirac structures is induced from the variational\nconstraint. Furthermore, the variational structure associated to this Dirac\nformulation is presented in the context of the Lagrange-d'Alembert-Pontryagin\nprinciple.

The popularity of tools for analyzing Technical Debt, and\nparticularly the popularity of SonarQube, is increasing rapidly. SonarQube\nproposes a set of coding rules, which represent something wrong in the code\nthat will soon be reflected in a fault or will increase maintenance effort.\nHowever, our local companies were not confident in the usefulness of the rules\nproposed by SonarQube and contracted us to investigate the fault-proneness of\nthese rules. Objective. In this work we aim at understanding which SonarQube\nrules are actually fault-prone and to understand which machine learning models\ncan be adopted to accurately identify fault-prone rules. Method. We designed\nand conducted an empirical study on 21 well-known mature open-source projects.\nWe applied the SZZ algorithm to label the fault-inducing commits. We analyzed\nthe fault-proneness by comparing the classification power of seven machine\nlearning models. Result. Among the 202 rules defined for Java by SonarQube,\nonly 25 can be considered to have relatively low fault-proneness. Moreover,\nviolations considered as \"bugs\" by SonarQube were generally not fault-prone\nand, consequently, the fault-prediction power of the model proposed by\nSonarQube is extremely low. Conclusion. The rules applied by SonarQube for\ncalculating technical debt should be thoroughly investigated and their\nharmfulness needs to be further confirmed. Therefore, companies should\ncarefully consider which rules they really need to apply, especially if their\ngoal is to reduce fault-proneness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2019 13:04:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 07:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-20"}

The process is computationally expensive, ill-posed to\nillumination, background composition, pose variation, as well as inefficient to\nbe deployed on gallery sets with more than 1000 elements. Hashing is a faster\nalternative which involves representing images in reduced dimensional simple\nfeature spaces. Encoding images into binary hash codes enables similarity\ncomparison in an image-pair using the Hamming distance measure. The challenge,\nhowever, lies in encoding the images using a semantic hashing scheme that lets\nsubjective neighbors lie within the tolerable Hamming radius.

Hydrodynamic arguments and numerical\nsimulations show, nevertheless, that a three-dimensional elastic-line array\nwith short-ranged repulsive interactions, such as vortex matter in a type-II\nsuperconductor, forms at equilibrium a class-II hyperuniform two-dimensional\npoint pattern for any constant-$z$ cross section. In this case, density\nfluctuations vanish isotropically as $\\sim q^{\\alpha}$ at small wave-vectors\n$q$, with $\\alpha=1$. This prediction includes the solid and liquid vortex\nphases in the ideal clean case, and the liquid in presence of weak uncorrelated\ndisorder. We also show that the three-dimensional Bragg glass phase is\nmarginally hyperuniform, while the Bose glass and the liquid phase with\ncorrelated disorder are expected to be non-hyperuniform at equilibrium.\nFurthermore, we compare these predictions with experimental results on the\nlarge-wavelength vortex density fluctuations of magnetically decorated vortex\nstructures nucleated in pristine, electron-irradiated and heavy-ion irradiated\nsuperconducting BiSCCO samples in the mixed state.

When probabilities are interpreted in the Bayesian sense, Bayes' law\nconstitutes a learning algorithm which shows how one can learn from a new\nobservation to improve their belief in a theory that is consistent with that\nobservation. Kolmogorov's notion of algorithmic information, which is based on\nthe theory of algorithms, proposes an objective measure of the amount of\ninformation in a finite string about itself and concludes that for any two\nfinite strings $x$ and $y$, the amount of information in $x$ about $y$ is\nalmost equal to the amount of information in $y$ about $x$. We view this\nconclusion of Kolmogorov as the algorithmic information version of Bayes' law.\nThis can be easily demonstrated if one considers the work of Levin on prefix\nKolmogorov complexity and then expresses the amount of Kolmogorov mutual\ninformation between two finite strings using Solomonoff's a priori probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2019 20:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-08"}

A typical post-event\nreconnaissance mission is conducted by first doing a preliminary survey,\nfollowed by a detailed survey. The preliminary survey is typically conducted by\ndriving slowly along a pre-determined route, observing the damage, and noting\nwhere further detailed data should be collected. This involves several manual,\ntime-consuming steps that can be accelerated by exploiting recent advances in\ncomputer vision and artificial intelligence. The objective of this work is to\ndevelop and validate an automated technique to support post-event\nreconnaissance teams in the rapid collection of reliable and sufficiently\ncomprehensive data, for planning the detailed survey. The technique\nincorporates several methods designed to automate the process of categorizing\nbuildings based on their key physical attributes, and rapidly assessing their\npost-event structural condition. It is divided into pre-event and post-event\nstreams, each intending to first extract all possible information about the\ntarget buildings using both pre-event and post-event images. Algorithms based\non convolutional neural network (CNNs) are implemented for scene (image)\nclassification. A probabilistic approach is developed to fuse the results\nobtained from analyzing several images to yield a robust decision regarding the\nattributes and condition of a target building.
