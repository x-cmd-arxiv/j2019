Here we consider the problem\nof optimal coding -- under an arbitrary coding scheme -- and show that it\npredicts Zipf's law of abbreviation, namely a tendency in natural languages for\nmore frequent words to be shorter. We apply this result to investigate optimal\ncoding also under so-called non-singular coding, a scheme where unique\nsegmentation is not warranted but codes stand for a distinct number. Optimal\nnon-singular coding predicts that the length of a word should grow\napproximately as the logarithm of its frequency rank, which is again consistent\nwith Zipf's law of abbreviation. Optimal non-singular coding in combination\nwith the maximum entropy principle also predicts Zipf's rank-frequency\ndistribution. Furthermore, our findings on optimal non-singular coding\nchallenge common beliefs about random typing. It turns out that random typing\nis in fact an optimal coding process, in stark contrast with the common\nassumption that it is detached from cost cutting considerations.

In this paper, we propose a novel task-guided pair\nembedding framework in heterogeneous network, called TaPEm, that directly\nmodels the relationship between a pair of nodes that are related to a specific\ntask (e.g., paper-author relationship in author identification). To this end,\nwe 1) propose to learn a pair embedding under the guidance of its associated\ncontext path, i.e., a sequence of nodes between the pair, and 2) devise the\npair validity classifier to distinguish whether the pair is valid with respect\nto the specific task at hand. By introducing pair embeddings that capture the\nsemantics behind the pairwise relationships, we are able to learn the\nfine-grained pairwise relationship between two nodes, which is paramount for\ntask-guided embedding methods.

In particular, autonomous\nvehicles may face moral dilemmas in accident scenarios, such as staying the\ncourse resulting in hurting pedestrians or swerving leading to hurting\npassengers. To investigate such ethical dilemmas, recent studies have adopted\npreference aggregation, in which each voter expresses her/his preferences over\ndecisions for the possible ethical dilemma scenarios, and a centralized system\naggregates these preferences to obtain the winning decision. Although a useful\nmethodology for building ethical AI systems, such an approach can potentially\nviolate the privacy of voters since moral preferences are sensitive information\nand their disclosure can be exploited by malicious parties. In this paper, we\nreport a first-of-its-kind privacy-preserving crowd-guided AI decision-making\napproach in ethical dilemmas. We adopt the notion of differential privacy to\nquantify privacy and consider four granularities of privacy protection by\ntaking voter-/record-level privacy protection and centralized/distributed\nperturbation into account, resulting in four approaches VLCP, RLCP, VLDP, and\nRLDP. Moreover, we propose different algorithms to achieve these privacy\nprotection granularities, while retaining the accuracy of the learned moral\npreference model.

While elegant\nand simple to apply, properties as such are rarely k-inductive and when they\ncan be strengthened, there is no effective strategy to guess the depth of\ninduction. It has been mostly displaced by techniques that compute inductive\nstrengthenings based on interpolation and property directed reachability (Pdr).\nIn this paper, we present kAvy, an SMC algorithm that effectively uses\nk-induction to guide interpolation and Pdr-style inductive generalization.\nUnlike pure k-induction, kAvy uses Pdr-style generalization to compute and\nstrengthen an inductive trace. Unlike pure Pdr, kAvy uses relative k-induction\nto construct an inductive invariant. The depth of induction is adjusted\ndynamically by minimizing a proof of unsatisfiability. We have implemented kAvy\nwithin the Avy Model Checker and evaluated it on HWMCC instances. Our results\nshow that kAvy is more effective than both Avy and Pdr, and that using\nk-induction leads to faster running time and solving more instances.

Those algorithms, however, are\nnot yet capable of scaling well to very large graphs with billions of edges. In\nthis paper we develop novel tools for the `motif counting via color coding'\nframework. As a result, our new algorithm, Motivo, is able to scale well to\nlarger graphs while at the same time provide more accurate graphlet counts than\never before. This is achieved thanks to two types of improvements. First, we\ndesign new succinct data structures that support fast common color coding\noperations, and a biased coloring trick that trades accuracy versus running\ntime and memory usage. These adaptations drastically reduce the time and memory\nrequirements of color coding. Second, we develop an adaptive graphlet sampling\nstrategy, based on a fractional set cover problem, that breaks the additive\napproximation barrier of standard sampling. This strategy gives multiplicative\napproximations for all graphlets at once, allowing us to count not only the\nmost frequent graphlets but also extremely rare ones.\n  To give an idea of the improvements, in $40$ minutes Motivo counts $7$-nodes\nmotifs on a graph with $65$M nodes and $1.8$B edges; this is $30$ and $500$\ntimes larger than the state of the art, respectively in terms of nodes and\nedges.

To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a new, higher level\nframework, i.e. Nemesyst, which uses databases along with model\nsequentialisation to allow processes to be fed unique and transformed data at\nthe point of need. This facilitates near real-time application and makes models\navailable for further training or use at any node that has access to the\ndatabase simultaneously. Nemesyst is well suited as an application framework\nfor internet of things aggregated control systems, deploying deep learning\ntechniques to optimise individual machines in massive networks. To demonstrate\nthis framework, we adopted a case study in a novel domain; deploying deep\nlearning to optimise the high speed control of electrical power consumed by a\nmassive internet of things network of retail refrigeration systems in\nproportion to load available on the UK National Grid (a demand side response).\nThe case study demonstrated for the first time in such a setting how deep\nlearning models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (vanilla and Long-Short-Term\nMemory) and Generative Adversarial Networks paired with Nemesyst, achieve\ncompelling performance, whilst still being malleable to future adjustments as\nboth the data and requirements inevitably change over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2019 17:23:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 22:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-22"}

We extend the\ninteracting torque equilibrium formalism, incorporating the effects of DM\ninteraction, to appropriately account for the zero-point quantum fluctuation\nthat manifests as the emergence of spin Casimir effect in a noncollinear spin\nspiral state. Using inelastic neutron scattering data from Cs$_2$CuCl$_4$ we\nfit the 1/S corrected TESWT dispersion to extract exchange and DM interaction\nparameters. We use these new fit coefficients alongside other relevant model\nparameters to investigate, compare, and contrast the effects of spatial\nanisotropy and DM interaction on the RIXS spectra at various points across the\nmagnetic Brillouin zone. We highlight the key features of the bi- and trimagnon\nRIXS spectrum at the two inequivalent rotonlike points, $M(0,2 \\pi/\\sqrt{3})$\nand $M^{\\prime}(\\pi,\\pi/\\sqrt{3})$, whose behavior is quite different from an\nisotropic triangular lattice system. While the roton RIXS spectrum at the $M$\npoint undergoes a spectral downshift with increasing anisotropy, the peak at\nthe $M^\\prime$ location loses its spectral strength without any shift. With the\ninclusion of DM interaction the spiral phase is more stable and the peak at\nboth $M$ and $M^\\prime$ point exhibits a spectral upshift. Our calculation\noffers a practical example of how to calculate interacting RIXS spectra in a\nnon-collinear quantum magnet using TESWT.

Massive halos' spins are oriented perpendicularly to\ntheir closest filament's axis and walls, while low mass halos tend to have\ntheir spins parallel to filaments and in the plane of walls. A similar\nmass-dependent spin flip is found for galaxies, albeit with a weaker signal\nparticularly at low mass and low-z, suggesting that galaxies' spins retain\nmemory of their larger-scale environment. Low-z star-forming and\nrotation-dominated galaxies tend to have spins parallel to nearby filaments,\nwhile quiescent and dispersion-dominated galaxies show preferentially\nperpendicular orientation; the star formation trend can be fully explained by\nthe stellar mass correlation, but the morphology trend cannot. There is a\nstrong dependence on HI mass, such that high-HI galaxies tend to have parallel\nspins while low-HI galaxies are perpendicular, which persists even when\nmatching samples in stellar mass, suggesting that HI content traces anisotropic\ninfall more faithfully than the stellar component. Finally, at fixed stellar\nmass, the strength of spin alignments correlates with the filament's density,\nwith parallel alignment for galaxies in high density environments. These\nfindings are consistent with conditional tidal torque theory, and highlight a\nsignificant correlation between galactic spin and the larger scale tides that\nare important e.g. for interpreting weak lensing studies.

Typically, the\nperformance of deep RL algorithms is evaluated via on-policy interactions with\nthe target environment. However, comparing models in a real-world environment\nfor the purposes of early stopping or hyperparameter tuning is costly and often\npractically infeasible. This leads us to examine off-policy policy evaluation\n(OPE) in such settings. We focus on OPE for value-based methods, which are of\nparticular interest in deep RL, with applications like robotics, where\noff-policy algorithms based on Q-function estimation can often attain better\nsample complexity than direct policy optimization. Existing OPE metrics either\nrely on a model of the environment, or the use of importance sampling (IS) to\ncorrect for the data being off-policy. However, for high-dimensional\nobservations, such as images, models of the environment can be difficult to fit\nand value-based methods can make IS hard to use or even ill-conditioned,\nespecially when dealing with continuous action spaces. In this paper, we focus\non the specific case of MDPs with continuous action spaces and sparse binary\nrewards, which is representative of many important real-world applications. We\npropose an alternative metric that relies on neither models nor IS, by framing\nOPE as a positive-unlabeled (PU) classification problem with the Q-function as\nthe decision function. We experimentally show that this metric outperforms\nbaselines on a number of tasks.

The (classical) null\ncondition guarantees that such a result holds, but it is too strong to capture\ncertain systems -- most famously the Einstein equations -- which nevertheless\nadmit global solutions for small initial data. The weak null condition has been\nproposed as a sufficient condition for such a result to hold; it takes the form\nof a condition on a related set of nonlinear ODEs known as the \"asymptotic\nsystem\". Previous results in this direction have required certain structural\nconditions on the asymptotic system in addition to the weak null condition. In\nthis work we show that, if the solutions to the asymptotic system are bounded\n(given small initial data), and, in addition, if these solutions are stable\nagainst rapidly decaying perturbations, then the corresponding system of\nnonlinear wave equations admits global solutions for all sufficiently small\ninitial data. This avoids any direct assumptions on the structure of the\nnonlinear terms. We also give an example of a class of systems obeying this\ncondition but not obeying previously identified structural conditions.

In this process,\nthe target is usually assumed to be in excess, so that its concentration does\nnot significantly vary while hybridizing to the surface-bound probes. If the\ntarget is initially at low concentrations and/or if the number of probes is\nvery large and have high affinity for the target, the DNA in solution may get\ndepleted. In this paper we analyze the equilibrium and kinetics of\nhybridization of DNA biosensors in the case of strong target depletion, by\nextending the Langmuir adsorption model. We focus, in particular, on the\ndetection of a small amount of a single-nucleotide \"mutant\" sequence\n(concentration $c_2$) in a solution, which differs by one or more nucleotides\nfrom an abundant \"wild-type\" sequence (concentration $c_1 \\gg c_2$).

Using representative values of rate constants and hybridization\nfree energies, we find that in the depletion regime one could detect relative\nconcentrations $c_2/c_1$ that are up to three orders of magnitude smaller than\nin the conventional approach. The kinetics is surprisingly rich, and exhibits a\nnon-monotonic adsorption with no counterpart in the no-depletion case. Finally,\nwe show that, alongside enhanced detection sensitivity, this approach offers\nthe possibility of sample enrichment, by substantially increasing the relative\namount of the mutant over the wild-type sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2019 18:08:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 08:41:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-27"}

The focus in particular is on nonrelativistic neutrinos with\nquasi-degenerate masses, for which oscillations in free space are described by\nthe same formula, to lowest order, as relativistic neutrinos. Trapping these\nparticles engenders corrections to their oscillation frequencies because the\ninterference terms are between discrete energy levels rather than continuous\nspectra. Especially novel is the frequency shift that occurs due to the\ndependence of the energy levels on the mass of the neutrino: this part of the\ncorrection is nonvanishing even in the extremely nonrelativistic limit,\nreflecting the fact that the neutrino mass states have different zero-point\nenergies in the well.

In this work, we focus on achieving sustainable transportation\nby incentivizing passengers to switch from private cars to public transport. We\naddress the following challenges. First, the passengers incur inconvenience\ncosts when changing their transit behaviors due to delay and discomfort, and\nthus need to be reimbursed. Second, the inconvenience cost, however, is unknown\nto the government when choosing the incentives. Furthermore, changing transit\nbehaviors raises privacy concerns from passengers. An adversary could infer\npersonal information, (e.g., daily routine, region of interest, and wealth), by\nobserving the decisions made by the government, which are known to the public.\nWe adopt the concept of differential privacy and propose privacy-preserving\nincentive designs under two settings, denoted as two-way communication and\none-way communication. Under two-way communication, passengers submit bids and\nthen the government determines the incentives, whereas in one-way communication\nthe government simply sets a price without acquiring information from the\npassengers. Under one-way communication, we focus on how the government should\ndesign the incentives without revealing passengers' inconvenience costs while\nstill preserving differential privacy. We formulate the problem as a convex\nprogram, and propose a differentially private and near-optimal solution\nalgorithm. A numerical case study using Caltrans Performance Measurement System\n(PeMS) data source is presented as evaluation.

In this context, this work considers the nonlinear steady-state\nversion of the gas flow (GF) problem. It first establishes that the solution to\nthe GF problem is unique under arbitrary NGN topologies, compressor types, and\nsets of specifications. For GF setups where pressure is specified on a single\n(reference) node and compressors do no appear in cycles, the GF task is posed\nas an convex minimization. To handle more general setups, a GF solver relying\non a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained quadratic program (MI-QCQP) is\nalso devised. This solver can be used for any GF setup at any NGN. It\nintroduces binary variables to capture flow directions; relaxes the pressure\ndrop equations to quadratic inequality constraints; and uses a carefully\nselected objective to promote the exactness of this relaxation. The relaxation\nis provably exact in NGNs with non-overlapping cycles and a single\nfixed-pressure node. The solver handles efficiently the involved bilinear terms\nthrough McCormick linearization.

In this work, we conduct a theoretical and numerical study on such a\nflow-driven \"watermill\" at low Reynolds number, focusing on its hydrodynamic\nfeatures. We model the watermill by a collection of equally-spaced rigid rods.\nBased on the classical resistive force (RF) theory and direct numerical\nsimulations, we compute the watermill's instantaneous rotational velocity as a\nfunction of its rod number $N$, position and orientation. When $N \\geq 4$, the\nRF theory predicts that the watermill's rotational velocity is independent of\n$N$ and its orientation, implying the full rotational symmetry (of infinity\norder), even though the geometrical configuration exhibits a lower-fold\nrotational symmetry; the numerical solutions including hydrodynamic\ninteractions show a weak dependence on $N$ and the orientation. In addition, we\nadopt a dynamical system approach to identify the equilibrium positions of the\nwatermill and analyse their stability. We further compare the theoretically and\nnumerically derived rotational velocities, which agree with each other in\ngeneral, while considerable discrepancy arises in certain configurations owing\nto the hydrodynamic interactions neglected by the RF theory. We confirm this\nconclusion by employing the RF-based asymptotic framework incorporating\nhydrodynamic interactions for a simpler watermill consisting of two or three\nrods and we show that accounting for hydrodynamic interactions can\nsignificantly enhance the accuracy of the theoretical predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 00:28:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-06"}

Moreover, the typical\nmethods for the analysis of multi-layered hybrid configurations can be\nexhaustive due to the complex mode couplings at the interfaces of the layers.\nIn contrast, an early method can analyze the single-slit transmission for\nsolutions entirely in real space [F. L. Neerhoff and G. Mur, Appl. Sci.

In\nthis article, we advance the method by developing a new type of Green's\nfunction for the asymmetric waveguide modes inside a groove. Since these wave\nmodes are independent in real space, the coupling physics from the method\nbecomes straightforward and the solutions are intuitive. With this meticulous\nmethod, we show that complex and multi-layered hybrid configurations can be\neasily analyzed with excellent accuracy.

To handle these flaws, we propose a light-weight deep model,\ni.e., the One-pass Multi-task Network (OM-Net) to solve class imbalance better\nthan MC does, while requiring only one-pass computation. First, OM-Net\nintegrates the separate segmentation tasks into one deep model, which consists\nof shared parameters to learn joint features, as well as task-specific\nparameters to learn discriminative features. Second, to more effectively\noptimize OM-Net, we take advantage of the correlation among tasks to design\nboth an online training data transfer strategy and a curriculum learning-based\ntraining strategy.

In addition to providing a sense of safety, NNS even can\nbe regarded as an indicator of infant's central nervous system development. The\nrich data, such as sucking frequency, the number of cycles, and their amplitude\nduring baby's non-nutritive sucking is important clue for judging the brain\ndevelopment of infants or preterm infants. Nowadays most researchers are\ncollecting NNS data by using some contact devices such as pressure transducers.\nHowever, such invasive contact will have a direct impact on the baby's natural\nsucking behavior, resulting in significant distortion in the collected data.\nTherefore, we propose a novel contact-less NNS data acquisition and\nquantification scheme, which leverages the facial landmarks tracking technology\nto extract the movement signals of baby's jaw from recorded baby's sucking\nvideo. Since completion of the sucking action requires a large amount of\nsynchronous coordination and neural integration of the facial muscles and the\ncranial nerves, the facial muscle movement signals accompanying baby's sucking\npacifier can indirectly replace the NNS signal. We have evaluated our method on\nvideos collected from several infants during their NNS behaviors and we have\nachieved the quantified NNS patterns closely comparable to results from visual\ninspection as well as contact-based sensor readings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 04:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-06"}

Multi-task deep learning (MTL) tackles these three\ntasks jointly, which provides several advantages saving computing time and\nresources and improving robustness against overfitting. However, existing\nmultitask deep models start with each task as an individual task and integrate\nparallelly conducted tasks at the end of the architecture with one cost\nfunction. Such architecture fails to take advantage of the combined power of\nthe features from each individual task at an early stage of the training.

Traditional transfer learning deals with the same or\nsimilar task from different data sources (a.k.a. domain). The underlying\nassumption is that the knowledge gained from source domains may help the\nlearning task on the target domain. Our proposed FTMTLNet utilizes the\ndifferent tasks from the same domain. Considering features from the tasks are\ndifferent views of the domain, the combined feature maps can be well exploited\nusing knowledge from multiple views to enhance the generalizability.

We\nrevisit Edelbaum's question by taking a bottom-up approach to generate a\nminimum-fuel switching surface. Sweeping through time profiles of the\nminimum-fuel switching function for increasing admissible thrust magnitude, and\nin the high-thrust limit, we find that the continuous thrust switching surface\nreveals the $N$-impulse solution. It is also shown that a \\textit{fundamental}\nminimum-thrust solution plays a pivotal role in our process to determine the\noptimal minimum-fuel maneuver for all thrust levels. We find the answer to\nEdelbaum's question is not generally unique, but is frequently a set of\nequal-$\\Delta v$ extremals. We further find, when Edelbaum's question is\nrefined to seek the number of finite duration thrust arcs for a specific rocket\nengine, that a unique extremal is usually found.

Although the global feature functions are in general complex\nnonlinear functions, the group action on this space can be easily calculated by\nconstructing these functions as tensor-product representations of basic\nrepresentations, resulting in an explicit form of invariant feature functions.\nThe effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on several image datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 07:15:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 09:03:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2023 07:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

There are several variants of the similarity\nsearch problem, and one of the most relevant is the $r$-near neighbor ($r$-NN)\nproblem: given a radius $r>0$ and a set of points $S$, construct a data\nstructure that, for any given query point $q$, returns a point $p$ within\ndistance at most $r$ from $q$. In this paper, we study the $r$-NN problem in\nthe light of fairness. We consider fairness in the sense of equal opportunity:\nall points that are within distance $r$ from the query should have the same\nprobability to be returned. In the low-dimensional case, this problem was first\nstudied by Hu, Qiao, and Tao (PODS 2014). Locality sensitive hashing (LSH), the\ntheoretically strongest approach to similarity search in high dimensions, does\nnot provide such a fairness guarantee. To address this, we propose efficient\ndata structures for $r$-NN where all points in $S$ that are near $q$ have the\nsame probability to be selected and returned by the query. Specifically, we\nfirst propose a black-box approach that, given any LSH scheme, constructs a\ndata structure for uniformly sampling points in the neighborhood of a query.\nThen, we develop a data structure for fair similarity search under inner\nproduct that requires nearly-linear space and exploits locality sensitive\nfilters. The paper concludes with an experimental evaluation that highlights\n(un)fairness in a recommendation setting on real-world datasets and discusses\nthe inherent unfairness introduced by solving other variants of the problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 07:27:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 13:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

Using kinetic modeling of electrons, we re-evaluate the transport and\ndeposition of flare energy.

There is an anticorrelation between\nspecific dust mass ($M_{\\rm dust}$/$M_{\\star}$) and the time elapsed since the\nstarburst ended, indicating that dust was either destroyed, expelled, or\nrendered undetectable over the $\\sim$1 Gyr after the burst. The $M_{\\rm\ndust}$/$M_{\\star}$ depletion timescale, 205$^{+58}_{-37}$ Myr, is consistent\nwith that of the CO-traced $M_{\\rm H_2}/M_{\\star}$, suggesting that dust and\ngas are altered via the same process. Extrapolating these trends leads to the\n$M_{\\rm dust}/M_{\\star}$ and $M_{\\rm H_2}/M_{\\star}$ values of early-type\ngalaxies (ETGs) within 1-2 Gyr, a timescale consistent with the evolution of\nother PSB properties into ETGs. Comparing $M_{\\rm dust}$ and $M_{\\rm H_2}$ for\nPSBs yields a calibration, log $M_{\\rm H_2}$ = 0.45 log $M_{\\rm dust}$ + 6.02,\nthat allows us to place 33 PSBs on the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) plane, $\\Sigma\n\\rm SFR-\\Sigma M_{\\rm H_2}$. Over the first $\\sim$200-300 Myr, the PSBs evolve\ndown and off of the KS relation, as their star formation rate (SFR) decreases\nmore rapidly than $M_{\\rm H_2}$. Afterwards, $M_{\\rm H_2}$ continues to decline\nwhereas the SFR levels off. These trends suggest that the star-formation\nefficiency bottoms out at 10$^{-11}\\ \\rm yr^{-1}$ and will rise to ETG levels\nwithin 0.5-1.1 Gyr afterwards. The SFR decline after the burst is likely due to\nthe absence of gas denser than the CO-traced H$_2$. The mechanism of the\n$M_{\\rm dust}/M_{\\star}$ and$M_{\\rm H_2}/M_{\\star}$ decline, whose timescale\nsuggests active galactic nucleus (AGN) or low-ionization nuclear emission-line\nregion (LINER) feedback, may also be preventing the large CO-traced molecular\ngas reservoirs from collapsing and forming denser star forming clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 09:06:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 15:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

Solving this problem can be challenging if, during\noptimization, the automated method cannot access information about the location\nof the lesions nor is given single examples of the lesions. We propose a new\nweakly supervised detection method using neural networks, that computes\nattention maps revealing the locations of brain lesions. These attention maps\nare computed using the last feature maps of a segmentation network optimized\nonly with global image-level labels. The proposed method can generate attention\nmaps at full input resolution without need for interpolation during\npreprocessing, which allows small lesions to appear in attention maps. For\ncomparison, we modify state-of-the-art methods to compute attention maps for\nweakly supervised object detection, by using a global regression objective\ninstead of the more conventional classification objective. This regression\nobjective optimizes the number of occurrences of the target object in an image,\ne.g. the number of brain lesions in a scan, or the number of digits in an\nimage. We study the behavior of the proposed method in MNIST-based detection\ndatasets, and evaluate it for the challenging detection of enlarged\nperivascular spaces - a type of brain lesion - in a dataset of 2202 3D scans\nwith point-wise annotations in the center of all lesions in four brain regions.\nIn the brain dataset, the weakly supervised detection methods come close to the\nhuman intrarater agreement in each region. The proposed method reaches the best\narea under the curve in two out of four regions, and has the lowest number of\nfalse positive detections in all regions, while its average sensitivity over\nall regions is similar to that of the other best methods. The proposed method\ncan facilitate epidemiological and clinical studies of enlarged perivascular\nspaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 09:08:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 15:44:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 21:17:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 18:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-23"}

Current skin disease researches adopt the auto-classification\nsystem for improving the accuracy rate of skin disease classification. However,\nthe excessive dependence on the image sample database is unable to provide\nindividualized diagnosis service for different population groups. To overcome\nthis problem, a medical AI framework based on data width evolution and\nself-learning is put forward in this paper to provide skin disease medical\nservice meeting the requirement of real time, extendibility and\nindividualization. First, the wide collection of data in the close-loop\ninformation flow of user and remote medical data center is discussed. Next, a\ndata set filter algorithm based on information entropy is given, to lighten the\nload of edge node and meanwhile improve the learning ability of remote cloud\nanalysis model. In addition, the framework provides an external algorithm load\nmodule, which can be compatible with the application requirements according to\nthe model selected. Three kinds of deep learning model, i.e. LeNet-5, AlexNet\nand VGG16, are loaded and compared, which have verified the universality of the\nalgorithm load module. The experiment platform for the proposed real-time,\nindividualized and extensible skin disease recognition system is built. And the\nsystem's computation and communication delay under the interaction scenario\nbetween tester and remote data center are analyzed.

This enables us to theoretically investigate spatially resolved\nevolution of grain size distribution in a galaxy. The grain size distribution\nevolves from a large-grain-dominated ($\\gtrsim 0.1~\\mu$m) phase to a\nsmall-grain production phase, eventually converging to a power-law-like grain\nsize distribution similar to the so-called MRN distribution. We find that the\nsmall-grain abundance is higher in the dense ISM in the early epoch ($t\\lesssim\n1$ Gyr) because of efficient dust growth by accretion, while coagulation makes\nthe small-grain abundance less enhanced in the dense ISM later. This leads to\nsteeper extinction curves in the dense ISM than in the diffuse ISM in the early\nphase, while they show the opposite trend later. The radial trend is also\ndescribed by faster evolution in the inner part. We also confirm that the\nsimulation reproduces the observed trend in the relation between dust-to-gas\nratio and metallicity, and in the radial gradients of dust-to-gas ratio and\ndust-to-metal ratio.

The proposed method uses\na new eddy-identification algorithm (TrackEddy). This algorithm is based on the\npremise that the sea level signature of a coherent eddy can be approximated as\na Gaussian feature. The eddy Gaussian signature then allows for the calculation\nof kinetic energy of the eddy field through the geostrophic approximation.\nTrackEddy has been validated using synthetic sea surface height data, and then\nused to investigate trends of eddy kinetic energy in the Southern Ocean using\nSatellite Sea Surface Height anomaly (AVISO+).

Since the discovery of the first Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsar\nSAX J1808.4-3658 in 1998, the family of these sources kept growing on.\nCurrently, it counts 22 members. All AMXPs are transients with usually very\nlong quiescence periods, implying that mass accretion rate in these systems is\nquite low and not constant. Moreover, for at least three sources, a\nnon-conservative evolution was also proposed.\n  Aims. Our purpose is to study the long term averaged mass-accretion rates in\nall the Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars discovered so far, to investigate a\nnon-conservative mass-transfer scenario.\n  Methods. We calculated the expected mass-transfer rate under the hypothesis\nof a conservative evolution based on their orbital periods and on the (minimum)\nmass of the secondary (as derived from the mass function), driven by\ngravitational radiation and/or magnetic braking. Using this theoretical\nmass-transfer, we determined the expected accretion luminosity of the systems.\nThus, we achieved the lower limit to the distance of the sources by comparing\nthe computed theoretical luminosity and the observed flux averaged over a time\nperiod of 20 years. Then, the lower limit to the distance of the sources has\nbeen compared to the value of the distance reported in literature to evaluate\nhow reasonable is the hypothesis of a conservative mass-transfer.\n  Results. Based on a sample of 18 sources, we found strong evidences of a\nnon-conservative mass-transfer for five sources, for which the estimated\ndistance lower limits are higher than their known distances. We also report\nhints for mass outflows in other six sources. The discrepancy can be fixed\nunder the hypothesis of a non-conservative mass-transfer in which a fraction of\nthe mass transferred onto the compact object is swept away from the system,\nlikely due to the (rotating magnetic dipole) radiation pressure of the pulsar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 11:26:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

These are essential for non-linear Koiter shell models, since such\nshell models are non-convex (w.r.t.\\ terms of highest order). The estimates are\nobtained by introducing new analytical tools that allow to exploit dissipative\neffects of the fluid for the (non-dissipative) solid. The regularity result\ndepends on the geometric constitution alone and is independent of the\napproximation procedure; hence it holds for arbitrary weak solutions. The\ndeveloped tools are further used to introduce a generalized Aubin-Lions type\ncompactness result suitable for fluid-structure interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 12:07:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 13:46:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 10:41:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 18:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-15"}

We\nperform radiative transfer simulations of young stellar objects (YSOs) formed\nin hydrodynamical simulations, varying the structure and luminosity properties\nin order to estimate the long-wavelength, sub-mm and mm, variations of their\nflux. We find that the flux increase due to an outburst event depends on the\nprotostellar structure and is more prominent at sub-mm wavelengths than at mm\nwavelengths; e.g. a factor of 40 increase in the luminosity of the young\nprotostar leads to a flux increase of a factor of 10 at 250 micron but only a\nfactor of 2.5 at 1.3 mm.

Numerical studies\nhave managed to reproduce such decayless oscillations in the form of footpoint\ndriven standing waves in coronal loops, and to treat them as a possible\nmechanism for wave heating of the solar corona. Our aim is to investigate the\ncorrelation between the observed amplitudes of the oscillations and input the\nenergy flux from different drivers. We perform 3D MHD simulations in single,\nstraight, density-enhanced coronal flux tubes for different drivers, in the\npresence of gravity.

The development of the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability leads to mixing of plasma between the flux tube\nand the hot corona. Once the KHI is fully developed, the amplitudes of the\ndecayless oscillations show only a weak correlation with the driver strength.\nWe find that low amplitude decayless kink oscillations may correspond to\nsignificant energy fluxes of the order of the radiative losses for the Quiet\nSun. A clear correlation between the input energy flux and the observed\namplitudes from our synthetic imaging data cannot be established. Stronger\ndrivers lead to higher vales of the line width estimated energy fluxes.\nFinally, estimations of the energy fluxes by spectroscopic data are affected by\nthe LOS angle, favoring combined analysis of imaging and spectroscopic data for\nsingle oscillating loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 12:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-06"}

The\ndatabase for training this network is assembled through solving a set of\nmicroscopic boundary values problems with the prescribed macroscopic\ndeformation gradients (input data) and subsequently retrieving the\ncorresponding averaged energies (output data). Therefore, the two-scale\ncomputational procedure for the nonlinear elasticity can be broken down into\ntwo solvers for microscopic and macroscopic equilibrium equations that work\nseparately in two stages, called the offline and online stages. A standard\nfinite element method is employed to solve the equilibrium equation at the\nmacroscale.

Binary evolution\nmodels predict that if the initial orbital periods of such systems are shorter\nthan a few thousand days, their orbits should have circularised due to tidal\neffects. However, observations of the progeny of AGB binaries show that many of\nthese objects have substantial eccentricities, up to about 0.9. In this work we\nexplore the impact of wind mass transfer on the orbits of AGB binaries by\nperforming numerical simulations in which the AGB wind is modelled using a\nhydrodynamical code and the stellar dynamics is evolved using an N-body code.\nWe find that in most models wind mass transfer contributes to the\ncircularisation of the orbit, but on longer timescales than tidal\ncircularisation if the eccentricity is less than about 0.4. For low initial\nwind velocities and pseudo-synchronisation of the donor star, we find a\nstructure resembling wind Roche-lobe overflow near periastron. In this case,\nthe interaction between the gas and the stars is stronger than for high initial\nwind velocities and the orbit shrinks while the eccentricity decreases. In one\nof our models wind interaction is found to pump the eccentricity on a similar\ntimescale as tidal circularisation. Although our study is based on a small\nsample of models, it offers some insight into the orbital evolution of\neccentric binaries interacting via winds. A larger grid of numerical models for\ndifferent binary parameters is needed to test if a regime exists where\nhydrodynamical eccentricity pumping can effectively counteract tidal\ncircularisation, and if this can explain the puzzling eccentricities of the\ndescendants of AGB binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 14:03:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

A brown dwarf was discovered with the VLT/SPHERE instrument in\n2017, which orbits at $\\sim$ 11 au around HD 206893.

Despite extensive work since their apparition, the lowest jitter\nachievable with SNSPDs is still not clear, and the origin of the intrinsic\nlimits is not fully understood. Understanding its intrinsic behaviour and\nlimits is a mandatory step toward improvements. Here, we report our\nexperimental study on the intrinsically-limited timing jitter in molybdenum\nsilicide (MoSi) SNSPDs. We show that to reach intrinsic jitter, several\ndetector properties such as the latching current and the kinetic inductance of\nthe devices have to be understood. The dependence on the nanowire cross-section\nand the energy dependence of the intrinsic jitter are exhibited, and the origin\nof the limits are explicited. System timing jitter of 6.0 ps at 532 nm and 10.6\nps at 1550 nm photon wavelength have been obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 15:29:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

The categorical nature of these\ntasks has led to common use of a cross entropy log-loss objective during\ntraining. We suggest this loss is intuitively wrong when applied to\nplausibility tasks, where the prompt by design is neither categorically\nentailed nor contradictory given the context.

With\nthe phased data, we show that the smallest strip containing the source support\nwith the observation direction as the normal can be uniquely determined by the\nmulti-frequency far field pattern at a single observation direction. A phased\ndirect sampling method is also proposed to reconstruct the strip. The phaseless\nfar field data is closely related to the outward energy flux, which can be\nmeasured more easily in practice. We show that the phaseless far field data is\ninvariant under the translation of the sources, which implies that the location\nof the sources can not be uniquely recovered by the data. To solve this\nproblem, we consider simultaneously the scattering of magnetic dipoles with one\nfixed source point and at most three scattering strengths.

Recent advances in modeling brain-behavior\nrelationships have highlighted the effectiveness of Riemannian geometry for\nsummarizing the spatially correlated time-series from M/EEG in terms of their\ncovariance. However, after artefact-suppression, M/EEG data is often rank\ndeficient which limits the application of Riemannian concepts. In this article,\nwe focus on the task of regression with rank-reduced covariance matrices. We\nstudy two Riemannian approaches that vectorize the M/EEG covariance\nbetween-sensors through projection into a tangent space. The Wasserstein\ndistance readily applies to rank-reduced data but lacks affine-invariance. This\ncan be overcome by finding a common subspace in which the covariance matrices\nare full rank, enabling the affine-invariant geometric distance. We\ninvestigated the implications of these two approaches in synthetic generative\nmodels, which allowed us to control estimation bias of a linear model for\nprediction. We show that Wasserstein and geometric distances allow perfect\nout-of-sample prediction on the generative models. We then evaluated the\nmethods on real data with regard to their effectiveness in predicting age from\nM/EEG covariance matrices. The findings suggest that the data-driven Riemannian\nmethods outperform different sensor-space estimators and that they get close to\nthe performance of biophysics-driven source-localization model that requires\nMRI acquisitions and tedious data processing.

The accepted probing tools, based\non the fluid-flow model of a bottleneck link with first-in, first-out\nmultiplexing, estimate the available bandwidth by measuring packet dispersions.\nThe estimation becomes more difficult if packet dispersions deviate from the\nassumptions of the fluid-flow model in the presence of non-fluid bursty\ncross-traffic, multiple bottleneck links, and inaccurate time-stamping. This\nmotivates us to explore the use of machine learning tools for available\nbandwidth estimation. Hence, we consider reinforcement learning and implement\nthe single-state multi-armed bandit technique, which follows the\n$\\epsilon$-greedy algorithm to find the available bandwidth.

To deal with this issue, a common solution for autonomous cars is to\nintegrate recognition with prior maps. However, additional solution is required\nfor the detection and recognition of the traffic light. Deep learning\ntechniques have showed great performance and power of generalization including\ntraffic related problems. Motivated by the advances in deep learning, some\nrecent works leveraged some state-of-the-art deep detectors to locate (and\nfurther recognize) traffic lights from 2D camera images. However, none of them\ncombine the power of the deep learning-based detectors with prior maps to\nrecognize the state of the relevant traffic lights. Based on that, this work\nproposes to integrate the power of deep learning-based detection with the prior\nmaps used by our car platform IARA (acronym for Intelligent Autonomous Robotic\nAutomobile) to recognize the relevant traffic lights of predefined routes. The\nprocess is divided in two phases: an offline phase for map construction and\ntraffic lights annotation; and an online phase for traffic light recognition\nand identification of the relevant ones. The proposed system was evaluated on\nfive test cases (routes) in the city of Vit\\'oria, each case being composed of\na video sequence and a prior map with the relevant traffic lights for the\nroute.
