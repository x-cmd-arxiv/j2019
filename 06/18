We propose here a\nparameterised family of \"least-misfit gridding functions\" which minimise an\nupper bound on the difference between the DFT and FFT dirty images for a given\ngridding support width and image cropping ratio. When compared with the widely\nused spheroidal function with similar parameters, these provide more than 100\ntimes better alias suppression and RMS misfit reduction over the usable dirty\nmap. We discuss how appropriate parameter selection and tabulation of these\nfunctions allow for a balance between accuracy, computational cost and storage\nsize. Although it is possible to reduce the errors introduced in the gridding\nor degridding process to the level of machine precision, accuracy comparable to\nthat achieved by CASA requires only a lookup table with 300 entries and a\nsupport width of 3, allowing for a greatly reduced computation cost for a given\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 16:04:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Oct 2019 08:06:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

The original and widely used meaning of QH\ntheory is to put T=0 volume-dependent harmonic phonon energies omega_Q(V) into\nthe non-interacting phonon free energy. This paper uses that meaning, but\nextends it to include the use of T=0 V-dependent single-particle electron\nenergies epsilon_K(V). It is demonstrated that the \"bare\" quasiparticle (QP)\nenergies omega_Q(V) and epsilon_K(V) correctly give the first-order term in the\nV-dependence of the Helmholtz free energy F(V,T). Therefore, they give the\nleading order result for thermal expansion alpha(T) and for the\ntemperature-dependence of the bulk modulus B(T)-B_0. However, neglected\ninteractions which shift and broaden omega_Q with T, also shift the free\nenergy. In metals, the low T electron-phonon mass enhancement of states near\nthe Fermi level causes a shift in free energy that is similar in size to the\nelectronic QH term. Before T reaches the Debye temperature, the mass\nrenormalization essentially disappears, and remaining electron-phonon shifts of\nfree energy contribute only higher-order terms to thermal expansion. Similarly,\nanharmonic phonon-phonon interactions shift the free energy, but contribute to\nthermal expansion only in higher order. Explicit next order formulas are given\nfor thermal expansion, which relate \"true\" anharmonic and similar free energy\ncorrections to quasiparticle self-energy shifts.

By relaxing the semantics of a data structure, a bigger design\nspace, that allows weaker synchronization and more useful parallelism, is\nunveiled. Investigating new data structure designs, capable of trading\nsemantics for achieving better performance in a monotonic way, is a major\nchallenge in the area. We algorithmically address this challenge in this\npaper.To address this challenge, we present an efficient lock-free, concurrent\ndata structure design framework for out-of-order semantic relaxation. Our\nframework introduces a new two dimensional algorithmic design, that uses\nmultiple instances of an implementation of the given data structure. The first\ndimension of our design is the number of data structure instances onto which\noperations are spread to, in order to achieve increased parallelism through\ndisjoint memory accesses. The second dimension is the number of consecutive\noperations of a single thread that can stay at the same data structure instance\nin order to benefit from data locality. Our design can flexibly explore this\ntwo-dimensional space to achieve the property of monotonically increasing\nthroughput performance via relaxing concurrent data structure semantics within\na tight deterministic relaxation bound, as we prove in the paper. We show how\nour framework can instantiate lock-free out-of-order queues, stacks, counters\nand dequeues. The experimental evaluation shows that our two-dimensional data\nstructures: i) significantly outperform the respected previous proposed ones\nwith respect to scalability and throughput performance and ii) monotonically\nincrease throughput as relaxation increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 16:13:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2023 12:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

For iso-viscous cases, experimental and three-dimensional\nnumerical results of the film thickness distribution agree well with each\nother. The mean film thickness is well captured by the Aussillous & Qu\\'er\\'e\n(2000) model with fitting parameters. The droplet also exhibits the\n''catamaran'' shape that has been identified experimentally for a\npressure-driven counterpart (Huerre $\\textit{et al}$. 2015). This pattern has\nbeen rationalized using a two-dimensional lubrication equation. In particular,\nwe show that this peculiar film thickness distribution is intrinsically related\nto the anisotropy of the fluxes induced by the droplet's motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 16:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

M-Bias is a problem in causal inference\nwhere the correct estimation of treatment effects requires that certain\nvariables are not adjusted for i.e. are simply neglected from inclusion in the\nmodel.

The comet is associated with the Phoenicids, an otherwise minor\nmeteor shower that produced significant outbursts in 1956 and 2014. The shower\npoints to the existence of significant mass-loss events of P/Blanpain in recent\nhistory. P/Blanpain was recovered during an apparent large outburst in 2013\nJuly at an appreciable heliocentric distance of 3.9 au, with brightness\nincrease of 9 mag, making it one of the largest comet outbursts ever observed.\nHere we present an analysis of archival data taken by several telescopes. We\nfind that the 2013 outburst has produced $\\sim10^{8}$ kg of dust, which\naccounts for a modest fraction ($\\sim1\\%$) of the mass of P/Blanpain's nucleus\nas measured in 2004. Based on analysis of long-term lightcurve and modeling of\ncoma morphology, we conclude that the 2013 outburst was most likely driven by\nthe crystallization of amorphous water ice triggered by a spin-up disruption of\nthe nucleus. Dust dynamical model shows that a small fraction of the dust\nejecta will reach the Earth in 2036 and 2041, but are only expected to produce\nminor enhancements to the Phoenicid meteor shower. The 2013 outburst of\nP/Blanpain, though remarkable for a comet at small sizes, does not necessary\nimply a catastrophic disruption of the nucleus. The upcoming close encounter of\nP/Blanpain in 2020 January will provide an opportunity to examine the current\nstate of the comet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 17:19:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

While the dominant\nidea is that the cascade occurs through the physical process of vortex\nstretching, evidence for this is debated. In the framework of the\nKarman-Howarth equation for the two point turbulent kinetic energy, we derive a\nnew result for the average flux of kinetic energy between two points in the\nflow that reveals the role of vortex stretching. However, the result shows that\nvortex stretching is in fact not the main contributor to the average energy\ncascade; the main contributor is the self-amplification of the strain-rate\nfield. We emphasize the need to correctly distinguish and not conflate the\nroles of vortex stretching and strain-self amplification in order to correctly\nunderstand the physics of the cascade, and also resolve a paradox regarding the\ndiffering role of vortex stretching on the mechanisms of the energy cascade and\nenergy dissipation rate. Direct numerical simulations are used to confirm the\nresults, as well as provide further results and insights on vortex stretching\nand strain-self amplification at different scales in the flow.

The\nflat nature of the bands favors the formation of collective ground states and,\nin particular, TBLG has been shown to support superconductivity. When the\nenergy bands participating in the superconductivity are well-isolated, the\nsuperfluid weight scales inversely with the effective mass of such bands. For\nflat-band systems one would therefore conclude that even if superconducting\npairing is present most of the signatures of the superconducting state should\nbe absent.

Transactions are created during\nretail sales at the point of sale (POS) terminals and then sent to some central\nservers for validations and other business operations. A considerable\nproportion of the retail transactions may have inconsistencies due to many\ntechnical and human errors. SAP provides an automated process for error\ndetection but still requires a manual process by dedicated employees using\nworkbench software for correction. However, manual corrections of these errors\nare time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may lead to further errors due to\nincorrect modifications. This is not only a performance overhead on the\ncustomers' business workflow but it also incurs high operational costs. Thus,\nautomated detection and correction of transaction errors are very important\nregarding their potential business values and the improvement in the business\nworkflow. In this paper, we present an industrial case study where we apply\nmachine learning (ML) to automatically detect transaction errors and propose\ncorrections.

A potential presence\nof magnetospherically originated emission outside this region, the so-called\noff-pulse emission, would challenge the existing theories. Detection of\nsignificant off-pulse emission has been reported so far from only two pulsars,\nB0525+21 and B2045-16, at 325 and 610 MHz. However, the nature of this newly\nuncovered off-pulse emission remains unclear. To probe its origin we conducted\nvery high resolution radio observations of B0525+21 and B2045-16 with the\nEuropean VLBI Network (EVN) at 1.39 GHz. Whereas the pulsed emission is\ndetected at a level consistent with previous observations, we report absence of\nany off-pulse emission above $42$ and $96\\ \\mathrm{\\mu Jy\\ beam^{-1}}$ (three\ntimes the rms noise levels) for B0525+21 and B2045-16, respectively. Our\nstringent upper limits imply the off-pulse emission to be less than $0.4$ and\n$0.3\\%$ of the period-averaged pulsed flux density, i.e., much fainter than the\npreviously suggested values of $1$-$10\\%$. Since the EVN data are most\nsensitive to extremely compact angular scales, our results suggest a\nnon-magnetospheric origin for the previously reported off-pulse emission.\nPresence of extended emission that is resolved out on these milliarcsecond\nscales still remains plausible. In this case, we constrain the emission to\narise from structures with sizes of $\\sim (0.61$-$19) \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{au}$\nfor B0525+21 and $\\sim (0.48$-$8.3) \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{au}$ for B2045-16.\nThese constraints might indicate that the two pulsars are accompanied by\ncompact bow-shock pulsar wind nebulae. Future observations probing intermediate\nangular scales ($\\sim 0.1$-$5\\ \\mathrm{arcsec}$) will help in clarifying the\nactual origin of the off-pulse emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 17:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

The number of\nhigh-quality multi-epoch spectropolarimetric data sets for CCSNe remains quite\nlow, however, due to the challenging nature of such observations. In this\nThesis we present and analyse the data of two Type IIb SNe (SN 2008aq - two\nepochs, SN 2011hs - seven epochs) and one Type Ic-bl (SN 2014ad - seven\nepochs). The latter is the most complete spectropolarimetric data set for a\nType Ic-bl to date. We also provide a preliminary re-analysis of the\nspectropolarimetric data of SN 1993J. The new datasets demonstrate that the\nspectropolarimetry of stripped envelope supernovae is complex and varied, and\nalthough early studies of type IIb SNe showed similar behaviour to type IIP, it\nis now clear that this early trend is broken by a growing sample of SNe.\nAdditionally, we identified potential signatures of a jet in SN 2014ad.\nFurthermore, a toy model to simulate spectropolarimetry from simple geometries\n(similar to Reilly et al. 2016) was created. A systematic approach to parameter\nspace exploration was developped; this showed that unfortunately these models\nsuffer extreme degeneracies and may not lead to accurate interpretations.\nFinally, spectropolarimetry can also be used to probe asymmetries caused by\nfast rotation in the potential progenitors of stripped envelope CCSNe. Although\nnumerous Wolf-Rayet stars of type WN and WC have been observed with\nspectropolarimetry, no single WO stars have been studied to date. In our data\nof two Galactic WO stars, we found no line effect and could not sufficiently\nconstrain the rotational velocity to exclude a collapsar scenario. Therefore,\nthe absence of a line effect may not necessarily equate to a low rotational\nvelocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 16:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

This\nis highly interesting, as eccentricity can be used to distinguish between\ndifferent astrophysical merger channels. However, all of these recent studies\nare based on various Monte Carlo (MC) techniques that only include strong\ninteractions for the dynamical evolution of BBHs, whereas any binary generally\nundergoes orders-of-magnitude more weak interactions than strong. It is well\nknown that weak interactions primarily lead to a change in the binary's\neccentricity, which for BBHs implies that weak interactions can change their GW\ninspiral time and thereby their merger probability. With this motivation, we\nperform MC simulations of BBHs evolving in dense clusters under the influence\nof both weak and strong interactions. We find that including weak interactions\nleads to a notable increase in the number of BBHs that merge inside their\ncluster, which correspondingly leads to a higher number of eccentric LISA\nsources.

The presence of non-conservative terms with\nspatial derivatives in the model equations prevents a unique weak solution\nbehind a shock. We investigate a number of methods for the numerical solution\nof the two-fluid equations and find that, in the presence of shock waves, the\nresults generally depend on the numerical details (spatial reconstruction, time\nstepping, the CFL number, and the adopted discretization). All methods converge\nto a unique result if the energy partition between the thermal and non-thermal\nfluids at the shock is prescribed using a subgrid prescription.

A large number of researchers dedicate to uncovering the mechanisms\nabout brain maturity during adolescence. Motivated by both achievement in graph\nsignal processing and recent evidence that some brain areas act as hubs\nconnecting functionally specialized systems, we proposed an approach to detect\nthese regions from spectral analysis perspective. In particular, as human brain\nundergoes substantial development throughout adolescence, we addressed the\nchallenge by evaluating the functional network difference among age groups from\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) observations. Methods: We treated\nthese observations as graph signals defined on the parcellated functional brain\nregions and applied graph Laplacian learning based Fourier Transform (GLFT) to\ntransform the original graph signals into frequency domain. Eigen-analysis was\nconducted afterwards to study the behavior of the corresponding brain regions,\nwhich enables the characterization of brain maturation.

If V is a real vector space, then\nHowe-Kashiwara-Vergne (HKV) duality asserts that there is a one-one\ncorrespondence between the irreducible subrepresentations of Sp(V) and the\nirreps of an orthogonal group O(t). It is well-known that this duality fails\nover finite fields. Addressing this situation, Gurevich and Howe have recently\nassigned a notion of rank to each Sp(V) representation.

Human\nactivity recognition has gained popularity due to its demands in many practical\napplications such as entertainment, healthcare, simulations and surveillance\nsystems. Vision based activity recognition is gaining advantage as it does not\nrequire any human intervention or physical contact with humans. Moreover, there\nare set of cameras that are networked with the intention to track and recognize\nthe activities of the agent. Traditional applications that were required to\ntrack or recognize human activities made use of wearable devices. However, such\napplications require physical contact of the person.

Audio generated by TTS systems trained on publicly\navailable data tends to not only sound less natural, but also exhibits more\nbackground noise. In this work, we aim to lower TTS systems' reliance on\nhigh-quality data by providing them the textual knowledge extracted by deep\npre-trained language models during training. In particular, we investigate the\nuse of BERT to assist the training of Tacotron-2, a state of the art TTS\nconsisting of an encoder and an attention-based decoder.

SN 2014J is similar to other normal SNe Ia near the maximum\nlight, but it shows flux excess in the $B$ band in the early nebular phase.\nThis excess flux emission can be due to light scattering by some structures of\ncircumstellar materials located at a few 10$^{17}$ cm, consistent with a single\ndegenerate progenitor system or a double degenerate progenitor system with mass\noutflows in the final evolution or magnetically driven winds around the binary\nsystem.

However, its code\ncoverage-centric design is inefficient in vulnerability detection. First, it\nblindly selects seeds for concolic execution and aims to explore new code\ncontinuously. However, as statistics show, a large portion of the explored code\nis often bug-free. Therefore, giving equal attention to every part of the code\nduring hybrid testing is a non-optimal strategy.

However, in many industrial processes, enforcing closed-loop fast-slow\ndynamics for peculiarly non-separable ones is a prior request and a crucial\nissue to be resolved. Aiming at the above problem, this paper presents two\ndual-level model predictive control (MPC) algorithms for two-timescale\ndynamical systems with unknown bounded disturbance and input constraint. The\nproposed algorithms, each one composed of two regulators working in slow and\nfast time scales, are designed to generate closed-loop separable dynamics at\nthe high and low levels.

To illustrate this procedure, we generated synthetic EEG and fMRI\ntimeseries for a mismatch negativity (or auditory oddball) paradigm, using\nbiologically plausible model parameters (i.e., posterior expectations from a\nDCM of empirical, open access, EEG data). Using model inversion, we found that\nBayesian fusion provided a substantial improvement in marginal likelihood or\nmodel evidence, indicating a more efficient estimation of model parameters, in\nrelation to inverting fMRI data alone.

In this paper, we design efficient and tight algorithms\nfor public persuasion, and focus on a fundamental multi-agent persuasion model\nwith no inter-agent externalities and binary actions introduced by Arieli and\nBabichenko. En route, we develop new algorithmic techniques which may be of\nindependent interests.\n  First, we prove that optimal public persuasion is fixed parameter tractable.\nOur main result here relies on an interesting connection to a basic question in\ncombinatorial geometry: how many cells can $n$ hyperplanes divide $R^d$ into?\nWe use this connection to show a new characterization of public persuasion,\nwhich then enables efficient algorithm design. Second, we relax agent\nincentives and show that optimal public persuasion admits a bi-criteria PTAS\nfor monotone submodular objectives and this approximation is tight. To prove\nthis result, we establish an intriguing \"noise stability\" property of\nsubmodular functions which strictly generalizes the key result of Cheraghchi et\nal., originally motivated by applications of learning submodular functions and\ndifferential privacy. Finally, motivated by automated persuasion implemented as\nsoftware, we consider relaxing the equilibrium concept of the model to coarse\ncorrelated equilibrium.

Forecasting the load accurately,\nhowever, is considerable more difficult when only a few households are\nincluded. A way to mitigate this challenge is to provide a set of scenarios\ninstead of one point forecast, so an operator or utility can consider a range\nof behaviors. This paper proposes a novel scenario forecasting approach for\nresidential load using flow-based conditional generative models. Compared to\nexisting scenario forecasting methods, our approach can generate scenarios that\nare not only able to infer possible future realizations of residential load\nfrom the observed historical data but also realistic enough to cover a wide\nrange of behaviors.

In order to better capture\nthe complex temporal dependency of the forecasted future load on the condition,\nwe extend the structure design for the reversible transformations in flow-based\nconditional generative models by strengthening the coupling between the output\nand the conditional input in the transformations. The simulation results show\nthe flow-based designs outperform existing methods in scenario forecasting for\nresidential load by both providing more accurate and more diverse scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 04:37:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

Therefore, to efficiently solve large\noptimization problems with one-hot encoding, partitioning methods that extract\nsubproblems with as many feasible solutions as possible are required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 05:33:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Such NMR with the FQ\nis attractive because of the possibility to detect the relatively small number\nof nuclear spins in a local region ($\\sim\\mu$m) with low temperatures ($\\sim$\nmK) and low magnetic fields ($\\sim$ mT), in which other types of quantum\nsensing schemes cannot easily access. A sample containing nuclear spins is\ndirectly attached on the FQ, and the FQ is used as a magnetometer to detect\nmagnetic fields from the nuclear spins. Especially, we consider two types of\napproaches to NMR with the FQ. One of them is to use spatially inhomogeneous\nexcitations of the nuclear spins, which are induced by a spatially asymmetric\ndriving with radio frequency~(RF) pulses. Such an inhomogeneity causes a change\nin the DC magnetic flux penetrating a loop of the FQ, which can be detected by\na standard Ramsey measurement on the FQ. The other approach is to use a\ndynamical decoupling on the FQ to measure AC magnetic fields induced by Larmor\nprecession of the nuclear spins. In this case, neither a spin excitation nor a\nspin polarization is required since the signal comes from fluctuating magnetic\nfields of the nuclear spins. We calculate the minimum detectable density\n(number) of the nuclear spins for the FQ with experimentally feasible\nparameters. We show that the minimum detectable density (number) of the nuclear\nspins with these approaches is around $10^{21}$ /cm$^3$ ($10^8$) with an\naccumulation time of a second.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 05:35:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

This asymptotic result shows that\nthe Fr{\\'e}chet mean behaves almost as the usual Euclidean case for\nsufficiently concentrated distributions. However, the asymptotic covariance\nmatrix of the empirical mean is modified by the expected Hessian of the squared\ndistance. This Hessian matrix was explicitly computed in [5] for constant\ncurvature spaces in order to relate it to the sectional curvature. Although\nexplicit, the formula remains quite difficult to interpret, and the intuitive\neffect of the curvature on the asymptotic convergence remains unclear.\nMoreover, we are most often interested in the mean of a finite sample of small\nsize in practice. In this work, we aim at understanding the effect of the\nmanifold curvature in this small sample regime. Last but not least, one would\nlike computable and interpretable approximations that can be extended from the\nempirical Fr{\\'e}chet mean in Rie-mannian manifolds to the empirical\nexponential barycenters in affine connection manifolds. For distributions that\nare highly concentrated around their mean, and for any finite number of\nsamples, we establish explicit Taylor expansions on the first and second moment\nof the empirical mean thanks to a new Taylor expansion of the Riemannian\nlog-map in affine connection spaces. This shows that the empirical mean has a\nbias in 1/n proportional to the gradient of the curvature tensor contracted\ntwice with the covariance matrix, and a modulation of the convergence rate of\nthe covariance matrix proportional to the covariance-curvature tensor. We show\nthat our non-asymptotic high concentration expansion is consistent with the\nasymptotic expansion of the BP-CLT. Experiments on constant curvature spaces\ndemonstrate that both expansions are very accurate in their domain of validity.\nMoreover, the modulation of the convergence rate of the empirical mean's\ncovariance matrix is explicitly encoded using a scalar multiplicative factor\nthat gives an intuitive vision of the impact of the curvature: the variance of\nthe empirical mean decreases faster than in the Euclidean case in negatively\ncurved space forms, with an infinite speed for an infinite negative curvature.\nThis suggests potential links with the stickiness of the Fr{\\'e}chet mean\ndescribed in stratified spaces. On the contrary, the variance of the empirical\nmean decreases more slowly than in the Euclidean case in positive curvature\nspace forms, with divergence when we approach the limits of the Karcher \\&\nKendall concentration conditions with a uniform distribution on the equator of\nthe sphere, for which the Fr{\\'e}chet mean is not a single point any more.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 07:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

There are multiple methods to do the same. Old school methods used\nmachine learning algorithms and optimization techniques to suggest possible\ncolors to use. With advances in the field of deep learning, colorization\nresults have improved consistently with improvements in deep learning\narchitectures. The latest development in the field of deep learning is the\nemergence of generative adversarial networks (GANs) which is used to generate\ninformation and not just predict or classify. As part of this report, 2\narchitectures of recent papers are reproduced along with a novel architecture\nbeing suggested for general colorization. Following this, we propose the use of\ncolorization by generating makeup suggestions automatically on a face. To do\nthis, a dataset consisting of 1000 images has been created. When an image of a\nperson without makeup is sent to the model, the model first converts the image\nto grayscale and then passes it through the suggested GAN model. The output is\na generated makeup suggestion. To develop this model, we need to tweak the\ngeneral colorization model to deal only with faces of people.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 07:45:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

These\nhighly subradiant states have a linewidth that decreases with the number of\natoms much faster than it was shown previously. In addition, our study shows\nthat such states are present even if there are additional interaction channels\nbetween the atoms, i.e. they interact via waveguide mode of an optical\nnanofiber for instance. We develop a theoretical framework allowing to describe\nthe spectral properties of the system in terms of contributions from each\ncollective eigenstate and we show that subradiant states manifest themselves in\nthe transmission and reflection spectra, allowing to observe\ninteraction-induced transparency in a very narrow spectral range.

A promising approach to\novercome this obstacle for quantum technologies is based on deep level defects\nin semiconductors, with the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond being the\nmost prominent example. Unfortunately, diamond in sufficient quality is scarce,\nwhich motivated efforts to find similar defects in silicon carbide (SiC).

The number of different naive T cell clones in an\norganism reflects the number of different T cell receptors (TCRs) arising from\nrecombination of the V(D)J gene segments during T cell development in the\nthymus. TCR diversity and more specifically, the clone abundance distribution\nis an important factor in immune function. Specific recombination patterns\noccur more frequently than others while subsequent interactions between TCRs\nand self-antigens are known to trigger proliferation and sustain naive T cell\nsurvival. These processes are TCR-dependent, leading to clone-dependent thymic\nexport and naive T cell proliferation rates. Using a mean-field approximation\nto the solution of a regulated birth-death-immigration model and a modification\narising from sampling, we systematically quantify how TCR-dependent\nheterogeneities in immigration and proliferation rates affect the shape of\nclone abundance distributions (the number of different clones that are\nrepresented by a specific number of cells, or \"clone counts\"). By comparing\npredicted clone counts derived from our heterogeneous birth-death-immigration\nmodel with experimentally sampled clone abundances, we show that although\nheterogeneity in immigration rates causes very little change to predicted\nclone-counts, significant heterogeneity in proliferation rates is necessary to\ngenerate the observed abundances with reasonable physiological parameter\nvalues.

The\nconsistent-exchange vdW-DF-cx version and its spin extension represent the\nfirst examples of this class; In general, consistent vdW-DFs reflect a\nconcerted expansion of a formal recast of the adiabatic-connection formula, an\nexponential summation of contributions to the local-field response, and the\nDyson equation.

State-of-the-art approaches to multi-source early\nPSD estimation, given an estimate of the associated relative early transfer\nfunctions (RETFs), conventionally minimize the approximation error defined with\nrespect to the early correlation matrix, requiring non-negative inequality\nconstraints on the PSDs. Instead, we here propose to factorize the early\ncorrelation matrix and minimize the approximation error defined with respect to\nthe early-correlation-matrix square root. The proposed minimization problem --\nconstituting a generalization of the so-called orthogonal Procrustes problem --\nseeks a unitary matrix and the square roots of the early PSDs up to an\narbitrary complex argument, making non-negative inequality constraints\nredundant. A solution is obtained iteratively, requiring one singular value\ndecomposition (SVD) per iteration. The estimated unitary matrix and early PSD\nsquare roots further allow to recursively update the RETF estimate, which is\nnot inherently possible in the conventional approach. An estimate of the said\nearly-correlation-matrix square root itself is obtained by means of the\ngeneralized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD), where we further propose to\nrestore non-stationarities by desmoothing the generalized eigenvalues in order\nto compensate for inevitable recursive averaging.

To apply all of these tools we need for the\ninvariant circles to be attracting (or repelling) and for the system to be\ninvertible. This is a severe restriction compared to alternative methods, but\nit is very numerically efficient and allows us to study even highly irregular\ncircles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 12:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

Several research works have been done in order to study\nmobility behavior of users that mainly use users' significant locations.\nHowever, these existing analysis are extremely intrusive because they require\nthe knowledge of the frequently visited places of users, which thus makes it\nfairly easy to identify them. Consequently, in this paper, we present a\nprivacy-aware methodology to analyze mobility behavior of users. We firstly\npropose a new metric based on the well-known Shannon entropy, called\nspatio-temporal entropy, to quantify the mobility level of a user during a time\nwindow. Then, we compute a sequence of spatio-temporal entropy from the\nlocation history of the user that expresses user's movements as rhythms. We\nsecondly present how to study the effects of several groups of additional\nvariables on the evolution of the spatio-temporal entropy of a user, such as\nspatio-temporal, demographic and mean of transportation variables. For this, we\nuse Generalized Additive Models (GAMs).

We also evaluate\nthe prediction accuracy of a global GAM compared to individual GAMs and\nindividual AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models.

For large cross sections, these scatterings might occur in the\nEarth or Sun even prior to the detection. In this thesis, we study the impact\nof these pre-detection scatterings on direct searches of light DM with the use\nof Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. By simulating the trajectories and scatterings\nof many individual DM particles in the Earth or Sun, we determine the local\ndistortions of the statistical properties of DM at any detector caused by\nelastic DM-nucleus collisions. Scatterings inside the Earth distort the\nunderground DM density and velocity distribution. Any detector moves\nperiodically through these inhomogeneities due to the Earth's rotation, and the\nexpected event rate will vary throughout a sidereal day. Using MC simulations,\nwe can determine the exact amplitude and phase of this diurnal modulation for\nany experiment. For even higher scattering probabilities, collisions in the\noverburden above the typically underground detectors start to attenuate the\nincoming DM flux. The critical cross section above which an experiment loses\nsensitivity to DM itself is determined for a variety of DM-nucleus and\nDM-electron scattering experiments and different interaction types.\nFurthermore, we develop the idea that sub-GeV DM particles can enter the Sun,\ngain kinetic energy by colliding on hot nuclei and get reflected with great\nspeeds. By deriving an analytic expressions for the particle flux from solar\nreflection via a single scattering, we demonstrate the prospects of future\nexperiments to probe reflected DM and extend their sensitivity to lower masses\nthan accessible by halo DM alone. Finally, we present first results for MC\nsimulations of solar reflections taking into account the effect of multiple\nscatterings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 13:13:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

The conformal\nboundary conditions (CBC) we find are of two types. The first is free boundary\nPotts spins, for which we confirm an old conjecture for the generating\nfunctions of conformal levels, and show them to be related to characters in a\nnon-linear deformation of the $W_\\infty$ algebra. The second type of CBC -\nwhich corresponds to restricting the values of the Potts spins to a subset of\nsize $Q_1$, or its complement of size $Q-Q_1$, at alternating sites along the\nboundary - is new, and turns out to be conformal in the antiferromagnetic case\nonly. Using algebraic and numerical techniques, we show that the corresponding\nspectrum generating functions produce all the characters of discrete\nrepresentations for the coset CFT. The normalizability bounds of the associated\ndiscrete states in the coset CFT are found to have a simple interpretation in\nterms of boundary phase transitions in the lattice model. For $\\sqrt{Q} = 2\n\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{k}$, with $k \\ge 3$ integer, we show also how our boundary\nconditions can be reformulated in terms of a RSOS height model.

In principle, the service orchestration capability of the\nFog and Cloud Computing paradigms could be an effective means of dynamically\nproviding resource-augmentation to smartphones. Motivated by these\nconsiderations, the peculiar focus of this paper is on the joint and adaptive\noptimization of the resource and task allocations of mobile stream applications\nin 5G-supported multi-tier Mobile-Fog-Cloud virtualized ecosystems. The\nobjective is the minimization of the computing-plus-network energy of the\noverall ecosystem under hard constraints on the minimum streaming rate and the\nmaximum computing-plus-networking resources. To this end: 1) we model the\ntarget ecosystem energy by explicitly accounting for the virtualized and\nmulti-core nature of the Fog/Cloud servers; 2) since the resulting problem is\nnon-convex and involves both continuous and discrete variables, we develop an\noptimality-preserving decomposition into the cascade of a (continuous) resource\nallocation sub-problem and a (discrete) task-allocation sub-problem; and 3) we\nnumerically solve the first sub-problem through a suitably designed set of\ngradient-based adaptive iterations, while we approach the solution of the\nsecond sub-problem by resorting to an ad-hoc-developed elitary Genetic\nalgorithm.

Efficient\nNeural Architecture Search (ENAS), proposed by Pham et al. (2018), has recently\nreceived considerable attention due to its ability to find excellent\narchitectures within a comparably short search time. In this work, which is\nmotivated by the quest to further improve the learning speed of architecture\nsearch, we evaluate the learning progress of the controller which generates the\narchitectures in ENAS. We measure the progress by comparing the architectures\ngenerated by it at different controller training epochs, where architectures\nare evaluated after having re-trained them from scratch. As a surprising\nresult, we find that the learning curves are completely flat, i.e., there is no\nobservable progress of the controller in terms of the performance of its\ngenerated architectures. This observation is consistent across the CIFAR-10 and\nCIFAR-100 datasets and two different search spaces. We conclude that the high\nquality of the models generated by ENAS is a result of the search space design\nrather than the controller training, and our results indicate that one-shot\narchitecture design is an efficient alternative to architecture search by ENAS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 14:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

Our oscillator model is purely dissipative,\nwith a two-photon gain balanced by single- and three-photon loss processes.\nWhen the gain rate is low, loss processes dominate and the oscillator has a\nvery low photon occupation number. In contrast, for large gain rates, the\noscillator is driven into a limit-cycle state where photon numbers can become\nlarge. The bistability emerges between these limiting cases with a region of\ncoexistence of limit-cycle and low-occupation states. Although an individual\noscillator has no preferred phase, when two of them are coupled together a\nrelative phase preference is generated which can indicate synchronization of\nthe dynamics. We find that the form and strength of the relative phase\npreference varies widely depending on the dynamical states of the oscillators.\nIn the limit-cycle regime, the phase distribution is $\\pi$-periodic with peaks\nat $0$ and $\\pi$, whilst in the low-occupation regime $\\pi$-periodic phase\ndistributions can be produced with peaks at $\\pi/2$ and $3\\pi/2$.

We describe our approach, a\ncascading neural architecture with selective sharing of LSTM layers, and show\nthat explicitly training the model with negation as an auxiliary task helps\nimprove the main task of sentiment analysis. The effect is demonstrated across\nseveral different standard English-language data sets for both tasks and we\nanalyze several aspects of our system related to its performance, varying types\nand amounts of input data and different multi-task setups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 14:31:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 09:17:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

These techniques generally display aggregate\nstatistics computed over sets of event sequences that share common patterns.\nSuch techniques are often hindered, however, by the high-dimensionality of many\nreal-world event sequence datasets because the large number of distinct event\ntypes within such data prevents effective aggregation. A common coping strategy\nfor this challenge is to group event types together as a pre-process, prior to\nvisualization, so that each group can be represented within an analysis as a\nsingle event type. However, computing these event groupings as a pre-process\nalso places significant constraints on the analysis. This paper presents a\ndynamic hierarchical aggregation technique that leverages a predefined\nhierarchy of dimensions to computationally quantify the informativeness of\nalternative levels of grouping within the hierarchy at runtime. This allows\nusers to dynamically explore the hierarchy to select the most appropriate level\nof grouping to use at any individual step within an analysis. Key contributions\ninclude an algorithm for interactively determining the most informative set of\nevent groupings from within a large-scale hierarchy of event types, and a\nscatter-plus-focus visualization that supports interactive hierarchical\nexploration.

We\nconsider the case of 11Be, the archetypical one-neutron halo nucleus, impinging\non 12C at 68 MeV/nucleon, which are usual experimental conditions for such\nmeasurements. The low-energy constants of the description of 11Be are fitted to\nexperimental data as well as to predictions of an ab initio nuclear-structure\nmodel.\n  Results: One-neutron knockout reaction is confirmed to be purely peripheral,\nthe parallel-momentum distribution of the remaining core is only sensitive to\nthe asymptotics of the ground-state wavefunction and not to its norm.

To address this, we analyze stability and\nthe bifurcation properties of RCP in both the cases i.e., with and without\nqueue size feedback. The model considers flows with two different round-trip\ntimes, operating over a single bottleneck link. By using an exogenous\nbifurcation parameter, we show that the system loses stability via a Hopf\nbifurcation and hence we can expect a limit cycle branching from the fixed\npoint. We highlight that the presence of queue feedback can readily destabilize\nthe system. Using Poincar{\\`e} normal forms and the center manifold theorem, we\nshow that the Hopf bifurcation is super-critical in the case of RCP without\nqueue feedback. Whereas, in the presence of queue feedback, we show that the\nsystem can undergoes a sub-critical Hopf bifurcation for some parameter values.\nA sub-critical Hopf bifurcation can result in either large amplitude limit\ncycles or unstable limit cycles, and hence should be avoided in engineering\napplications. Thus, the presence of queue feedback would create adverse effects\non the stability of the emerging limit cycles.

Due to no involvement of CPU, one-sided\nRDMA becomes efficient to access the remote memory, and NVM technologies have\nthe strengths of non-volatility, byte-addressability and DRAM-like latency. In\norder to achieve end-to-end high performance, many efforts aim to synergize\none-sided RDMA and NVM. Due to the need to guarantee Remote Data Atomicity\n(RDA), we have to consume extra network round-trips, remote CPU participation\nand double NVM writes. In order to address these problems, we propose a\nzero-copy log-structured memory design for Efficient Remote Data Atomicity,\ncalled Erda. In Erda, clients directly transfer data to the destination address\nat servers via one-sided RDMA writes without redundant copy and remote CPU\nconsumption.

Numerical experiments isolate the\ninfluence of mixing on these gradients using idealized conditions with zero\nsurface heat and momentum flux. Prompted by theoretical considerations and\nobserved consequences of mixing, a new non-linear horizontal diffusion scheme\nis introduced as an alternative to the standard Laplacian diffusion. Results\nsuggest that when horizontal mixing is parameterized using constant\ndiffusivities, horizontal density compensation is substantially unchanged as\nthe gradients erode.

Increasing challenges arise\nwith the dependency on large amounts of real-time data coming from off-board\nsources. At the core of addressing these challenges lies the concept of a\nDigital Dependability Identity (DDI) of a component or system.

A key aspect of this\ndevelopment is the possibility for seamless and simultaneous development; from\noffice simulation to human-in-the-loop and to real-time tests that include\nvehicle and powertrain hardware. Driver's acceptance and comfort is rated in an\nadvanced diver simulator mounted on a hexapod, capable of emulating\nlongitudinal and lateral acceleration of a real vehicle.
