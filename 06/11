However, in systems with low-resolution\nADCs, obtaining channel state information (CSI) is difficult due to significant\ndistortions in the received signals. The primary motivation of this paper is to\nshow that learning techniques can mitigate the impact of CSI unavailability. We\nstudy the blind detection problem in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)\nsystems with low-resolution ADCs using learning approaches. Two methods, which\nemploy a sequence of pilot symbol vectors as the initial training data, are\nproposed. The first method exploits the use of a cyclic redundancy check (CRC)\nto obtain more training data, which helps improve the detection accuracy. The\nsecond method is based on the perspective that the to-be-decoded data can\nitself assist the learning process, so no further training information is\nrequired except the pilot sequence. For the case of 1-bit ADCs, we provide a\nperformance analysis of the vector error rate for the proposed methods.

Specifically, we\ndemonstrate the use of multi-stability embedded in origami skeleton to\neliminate the need for multiple actuators or digital controllers to coordinate\nthe complex robotic movements in peristaltic crawling. The crawling robot in\nthis study consists of two serially connected bistable origami segments, each\nfeaturing a generalized Kresling design and a foldable anchoring mechanism.\nMechanics analysis and experimental testing of this dual-segment module reveal\na deterministic deformation sequence or actuation cycle, which is then used to\ngenerate the different phases in a peristaltic-like locomotion gait. Instead of\nindividually controlling the segment deformation like in earthworm and other\ncrawling robots, we only control the total length of this robot. Therefore,\nthis approach can significantly reduce the total number of actuators needed for\nlocomotion and simplify the control requirements. Moreover, the richness in\nKresling origami design offers us substantial freedom to tailor the locomotion\nperformance. Results of this study will contribute to a paradigm shift in how\nwe can use the mechanics of multi-stability for robotic actuation and control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 16:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}

In the\nconsidered model, each user transmits a superposition of two messages to a base\nstation (BS) with separate transmit power and the BS uses a successive decoding\ntechnique to decode the received messages. To maximize each user's transmission\nrate, the users must adjust their transmit power and the BS must determine the\ndecoding order of the messages transmitted from the users to the BS. This\nproblem is formulated as a sum-rate maximization problem with proportional rate\nconstraints by adjusting the users' transmit power and the BS's decoding order.\nHowever, since the decoding order variable in the optimization problem is\ndiscrete, the original maximization problem with transmit power and decoding\norder variables can be transformed into a problem with only the rate splitting\nvariable. Then, the optimal rate splitting of each user is determined. Given\nthe optimal rate splitting of each user and a decoding order, the optimal\ntransmit power of each user is calculated. Next, the optimal decoding order is\ndetermined by an exhaustive search method. To further reduce the complexity of\nthe optimization algorithm used for sum-rate maximization in RSMA, a user\npairing based algorithm is introduced, which enables two users to use RSMA in\neach pair and also enables the users in different pairs to be allocated with\northogonal frequency. For comparisons, the optimal sum-rate maximizing\nsolutions with proportional rate constraints are obtained in closed form for\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), frequency division multiple access\n(FDMA), and time division multiple access (TDMA).

In the construction of this state, even if the adiabatic limit is\nconsidered, the interaction Lagrangian is multiplied by a smooth time cut-off.\nIn this way the interaction starts adiabatically and the correlation functions\nare free from divergences. The corresponding interaction Hamiltonian is a local\ninteracting field smeared over the interval of time where the chosen cut-off is\nnot constant. In order to cope with this smearing, the Matsubara propagator\nneeds to be modified. We obtain an expansion of the correlation functions of\nthe interacting equilibrium state as a sum over certain type of graphs with\nmixed edges, some of them correspond to modified Matsubara propagators and\nothers to propagators of the real time formalism. An integration over the\nadiabatic time cut-off is present in every vertex. However, at every order in\nperturbation theory, the final result does not depend on the particular form of\nthe cut-off function. The obtained graphical expansion contains in it both the\nreal time formalism and the Matsubara formalism as particular cases. Finally,\nwe show that a particular factorisation which is used to derive the ordinary\nreal time formalism holds only in special cases and we present a\ncounterexample.

This paper is interested in answering the question of\nhow users should sample online conversations to selectively favour the\ncurrently justified or accepted positions in the debate. We apply techniques\nfrom argumentation theory and complex networks to build a model that predicts\nthe probabilities of the normatively justified arguments given their location\nin online discussions.

However, it is a purely linear\nmodel and includes no representation of a battery's nonlinear phenomena. Hence,\nthis work transforms the original model by introducing a\nnonlinear-mapping-based voltage source and a serial RC circuit. The\nmodification is justified by an analogy with the single-particle model. Two\nparameter estimation approaches, termed 1.0 and 2.0, are designed for the new\nmodel to deal with the scenarios of constant-current and variable-current\ncharging/discharging, respectively. In particular, the 2.0 approach proposes\nthe notion of Wiener system identification based on maximum a posteriori\nestimation, which allows all the parameters to be estimated in one shot while\novercoming the nonconvexity or local minima issue to obtain physically\nreasonable estimates. An extensive experimental evaluation shows that the\nproposed model offers excellent accuracy and predictive capability. A\ncomparison against the Rint and Thevenin models further points to its\nsuperiority.

The performance of\napplied protocols such as quantum key distribution (QKD) depends significantly\nupon the transmission efficiency through the turbulent atmosphere, which is\nespecially challenging for ground-to-satellite uplink scenarios. Adaptive\noptics (AO) techniques have been used in astronomical, communication, and other\napplications to reduce the detrimental effects of turbulence for many years,\nbut their applicability to quantum protocols, and their requirements\nspecifically in the uplink scenario, are not well established. Here, we model\nthe effect of the atmosphere on link efficiency between an Earth station and a\nsatellite using an optical uplink, and how AO can help recover from loss due to\nturbulence. Examining both low-Earth-orbit and geostationary uplink scenarios,\nwe find that a modest link transmissivity improvement of about 3dB can be\nobtained in the case of a co-aligned downward beacon, while the link can be\ndramatically improved, up to 7dB, using an offset beacon, such as a laser guide\nstar. AO coupled with a laser guide star would thus deliver a significant\nincrease in the secret key generation rate of the QKD ground-to-space uplink\nsystem, especially as reductions of channel loss have favourably nonlinear\nkey-rate response within this high-loss regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 18:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2021 00:05:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

The narrow\nescape problem is the dual problem: it models the behavior of a Brownian\nparticle confined to the interior of a sphere whose surface is reflective,\nexcept for a collection of small patches through which it can escape.\n  Mathematically, these give rise to mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary value\nproblems of the Poisson equation. They are numerically challenging for two main\nreasons: (1) the solutions are non-smooth at Dirichlet-Neumann interfaces, and\n(2) they involve adaptive mesh refinement and the solution of large,\nill-conditioned linear systems when the number of small patches is large.\n  By using the Neumann Green's functions for the sphere, we recast each\nboundary value problem as a system of first-kind integral equations on the\ncollection of patches. A block-diagonal preconditioner together with a multiple\nscattering formalism leads to a well-conditioned system of second-kind integral\nequations and a very efficient approach to discretization.

For this purpose, we investigate\ntwo experimentally relevant hydrogen bonded systems -- one system consists of\nshort poly({N}-acryloyl piperidine) (PAP) blended with longer chains of\npoly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and the second system is a mixture of PAA and short\npoly(acrylamide) (PAM) chains. Simulation results show that PAA-PAP blends are\nat the onset of phase separation over the full range of PAP monomer mole\nfraction $\\phi_{PAP}$, which intensifies even more for $\\phi_{PAP} > 0.3$.\nWhile PAA and PAP interact with preferential hydrogen bonding, phase separation\nis triggered by the dominant van der Waals attraction between the hydrophobic\nside groups of PAP. However, if PAP is replaced with PAM, which has a similar\nchemical structure as PAP without the hydrophobic side group, PAA-PAM blends\nshow much improved solubility. Better solubility is due to the preferential\nhydrogen bonding between PAA and PAM. As a result, PAM oligomers act as\ncross-linking bridges between PAA chains resulting in a three dimensional\nhighly cross-linked network. While $\\kappa$ for PAA-PAP blends remain almost\ninvariant with $\\phi_{PAP}$, PAA-PAM systems show improved $\\kappa$ with\nincreasing PAM concentration and also with respect to PAA-PAP blends.\nConsistent with the theoretical prediction for the thermal transport of\namorphous polymers, we show that $\\kappa$ is proportional to the materials\nstiffness, i.e., the bulk modulus K and sound velocity v of PAA-PAM blends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 18:50:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 01:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

One application of this technology is to visualize and to\ncharacterize human tongue shape and motion during a real-time speech to study\nhealthy or impaired speech production. Due to the noisy nature of ultrasound\nimages with low-contrast characteristic, it might require expertise for\nnon-expert users to recognize organ shape such as tongue surface (dorsum). To\nalleviate this difficulty for quantitative analysis of tongue shape and motion,\ntongue surface can be extracted, tracked, and visualized instead of the whole\ntongue region. Delineating the tongue surface from each frame is a cumbersome,\nsubjective, and error-prone task. Furthermore, the rapidity and complexity of\ntongue gestures have made it a challenging task, and manual segmentation is not\na feasible solution for real-time applications. Employing the power of\nstate-of-the-art deep neural network models and training techniques, it is\nfeasible to implement new fully-automatic, accurate, and robust segmentation\nmethods with the capability of real-time performance, applicable for tracking\nof the tongue contours during the speech.

Typical neural TTS models learn the\naverage of the data because they minimise mean squared error. In the context of\nprosody, taking the average produces flatter, more boring speech: an \"average\nprosody\". A generative model that can synthesise multiple prosodies will, by\ndesign, not model average prosody.

In image processing, kernels for\nspatial filtering possess some symmetry (e.g. Sobel operators, Gaussian,\nLaplacian). Convolutional layers in artificial feed-forward neural networks\nhave typically considered the kernel weights without any constraint. In this\npaper, we propose to investigate the impact of a symmetry constraint in\nconvolutional layers for image classification tasks, taking our inspiration\nfrom the processes involved in the primary visual cortex and common image\nprocessing techniques. The goal is to assess the extent to which it is possible\nto enforce symmetrical constraints on the filters throughout the training\nprocess of a convolutional neural network (CNN) by modifying the weight update\npreformed during the backpropagation algorithm and to evaluate the change in\nperformance. The main hypothesis of this paper is that the symmetrical\nconstraint reduces the number of free parameters in the network, and it is able\nto achieve near identical performance to the modern methodology of training. In\nparticular, we address the following cases: x/y-axis symmetry, point\nreflection, and anti-point reflection. The performance has been evaluated on\nfour databases of images. The results support the conclusion that while random\nweights offer more freedom to the model, the symmetry constraint provides a\nsimilar level of performance while decreasing substantially the number of free\nparameters in the model. Such an approach can be valuable in phase-sensitive\napplications that require a linear phase property throughout the feature\nextraction process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 19:55:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

The dust in the pressure trap is\nnot subject to radial drift so it can grow to reach sizes large enough to\nfragment.

Recently, algorithms based on Direct Coupling\nAnalysis (DCA) pairwise maximum-entropy models have allowed to identify\ninteraction partners among paralogous proteins from sequence data. This success\nof DCA at predicting protein-protein interactions could be mainly based on its\nknown ability to identify pairs of residues that are in contact in the\nthree-dimensional structure of protein complexes and that coevolve to remain\nphysicochemically complementary. However, interacting proteins possess similar\nevolutionary histories. What is the role of purely phylogenetic correlations in\nthe performance of DCA-based methods to infer interaction partners? To address\nthis question, we employ controlled synthetic data that only involve phylogeny\nand no interactions or contacts. We find that DCA accurately identifies the\npairs of synthetic sequences that share evolutionary history. While\nphylogenetic correlations confound the identification of contacting residues by\nDCA, they are thus useful to predict interacting partners among paralogs. We\nfind that DCA performs as well as phylogenetic methods to this end, and\nslightly better than them with large and accurate training sets. Employing DCA\nor phylogenetic methods within an Iterative Pairing Algorithm (IPA) allows to\npredict pairs of evolutionary partners without a training set. We demonstrate\nthe ability of these various methods to correctly predict pairings among real\nparalogous proteins with genome proximity but no known physical interaction,\nillustrating the importance of phylogenetic correlations in natural data.\nHowever, for physically interacting and strongly coevolving proteins, DCA and\nmutual information outperform phylogenetic methods.

Recent\nresearch shows that variational autoencoders (VAEs) yield state-of-the-art\nperformance by integrating flexible representations from deep neural networks\ninto latent variable models, mitigating limitations of traditional linear\nfactor models. VAEs are typically trained by maximizing the likelihood (MLE) of\nusers interacting with ground-truth items. While simple and often effective,\nMLE-based training does not directly maximize the recommendation-quality\nmetrics one typically cares about, such as top-N ranking. In this paper we\ninvestigate new methods for training collaborative filtering models based on\nactor-critic reinforcement learning, to directly optimize the\nnon-differentiable quality metrics of interest.

Introducing\nstochasticity is key to their success in practical problems, and there is some\nunderstanding of the role of stochastic gradient descent in this context.\nMomentum modifications of gradient descent such as Polyak's Heavy Ball method\n(HB) and Nesterov's method of accelerated gradients (NAG), are also widely\nadopted. In this work our focus is on understanding the role of momentum in the\ntraining of neural networks, concentrating on the common situation in which the\nmomentum contribution is fixed at each step of the algorithm. To expose the\nideas simply we work in the deterministic setting.\n  Our approach is to derive continuous time approximations of the discrete\nalgorithms; these continuous time approximations provide insights into the\nmechanisms at play within the discrete algorithms. We prove three such\napproximations. Firstly we show that standard implementations of fixed momentum\nmethods approximate a time-rescaled gradient descent flow, asymptotically as\nthe learning rate shrinks to zero; this result does not distinguish momentum\nmethods from pure gradient descent, in the limit of vanishing learning rate. We\nthen proceed to prove two results aimed at understanding the observed practical\nadvantages of fixed momentum methods over gradient descent. We achieve this by\nproving approximations to continuous time limits in which the small but fixed\nlearning rate appears as a parameter. Furthermore in a third result we show\nthat the momentum methods admit an exponentially attractive invariant manifold\non which the dynamics reduces, approximately, to a gradient flow with respect\nto a modified loss function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 21:36:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 19:32:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

With the lateral skip connection, the models can obtain and\nfuse both semantic and resolution information in deep layers to achieve more\naccurate segmentation performance. However, in many applications (e.g., blurry\nboundary images), these models often cannot precisely locate complex boundaries\nand segment tiny isolated parts. To solve this challenging problem, we firstly\nanalyze why simple skip connections are not enough to help accurately locate\nindistinct boundaries and argue that it is due to the fuzzy information in the\nskip connection provided in the encoder layers. Then we propose a\nsemantic-guided encoder feature learning strategy to learn both high resolution\nand rich semantic encoder features so that we can more accurately locate the\nblurry boundaries, which can also enhance the network by selectively learning\ndiscriminative features. Besides, we further propose a soft contour constraint\nmechanism to model the blurry boundary detection. Experimental results on real\nclinical datasets show that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art\nsegmentation accuracy, especially for the blurry regions.

Several previous\ncandidates for one-way group actions no longer stand, due to progress both on\nclassical algorithms (e.g., graph isomorphism) and quantum algorithms (e.g.,\ndiscrete logarithm).\n  We propose the general linear group action on tensors as a new candidate to\nbuild cryptography based on group actions. Recent works\n(Futorny--Grochow--Sergeichuk, Lin. Alg.

We\npresent evidence to justify the viability of this proposal from comprehensive\nstudy of the state-of-art heuristic algorithms, theoretical algorithms, and\nhardness results, as well as quantum algorithms.\n  We then introduce a new notion called pseudorandom group actions to further\ndevelop group-action based cryptography. Briefly speaking, given a group $G$\nacting on a set $S$, we assume that it is hard to distinguish two distributions\nof $(s, t)$ either uniformly chosen from $S\\times S$, or where $s$ is randomly\nchosen from $S$ and $t$ is the result of applying a random group action of\n$g\\in G$ on $s$. This subsumes the classical decisional Diffie-Hellman\nassumption when specialized to a particular group action. We carefully analyze\nvarious attack strategies that support the general linear group action on\ntensors as a candidate for this assumption.\n  Finally, we establish the quantum security of several cryptographic\nprimitives based on the one-way group action assumption and the pseudorandom\ngroup action assumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 00:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

Key components of\nunsupervised domain adaptation include: (a) maximizing performance on the\ntarget, and (b) aligning the source and target domains. Traditionally, these\ntasks have either been considered as separate, or assumed to be implicitly\naddressed together with high-capacity feature extractors. When considered\nseparately, alignment is usually viewed as a problem of aligning data\ndistributions, either through geometric approaches such as subspace alignment\nor through distributional alignment such as optimal transport. This paper\nrepresents a hybrid approach, where we assume simplified data geometry in the\nform of subspaces, and consider alignment as an auxiliary task to the primary\ntask of maximizing performance on the source. The alignment is made rather\nsimple by leveraging tractable data geometry in the form of subspaces.

Much of the progress in learning dynamics models in RL has\nbeen made by learning models via supervised learning. But traditional\nmodel-based approaches lead to `compounding errors' when the model is unrolled\nstep by step. Essentially, the state transitions that the learner predicts (by\nunrolling the model for multiple steps) and the state transitions that the\nlearner experiences (by acting in the environment) may not be consistent. There\nis enough evidence that humans build a model of the environment, not only by\nobserving the environment but also by interacting with the environment.\nInteraction with the environment allows humans to carry out experiments: taking\nactions that help uncover true causal relationships which can be used for\nbuilding better dynamics models. Analogously, we would expect such interactions\nto be helpful for a learning agent while learning to model the environment\ndynamics. In this paper, we build upon this intuition by using an auxiliary\ncost function to ensure consistency between what the agent observes (by acting\nin the real world) and what it imagines (by acting in the `learned' world).

We sampled and\nclassified 759 links from two different domains, regular expressions and\nAndroid development, to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the links'\ncontext and purpose, including attribution, awareness, and recommendations.

From geometric mechanics, it is known that for swimming at the\n\"Stokesian\" (viscous; zero Reynolds number) limit, the motion is governed by a\nreduced order \"connection\" model that describes how body shape change produces\nmotion for the body frame with respect to the world. In the \"perturbed Stokes\nregime\" where inertial forces are still dominated by viscosity, but are not\nnegligible (low Reynolds number), we show that motion is still governed by a\nfunctional relationship between shape velocity and body velocity, but this\nfunction is no longer linear in shape change rate. We derive this model using\nresults from singular perturbation theory, and the theory of noncompact\nnormally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIMs).\n  Using the theoretical properties of this reduced-order model, we develop an\nalgorithm that estimates an approximation to the dynamics near a cyclic body\nshape change (a \"gait\") directly from observational data of shape and body\nmotion. This extends our previous work which assumed kinematic \"connection\"\nmodels. To compare the old and new algorithms, we analyze simulated swimmers\nover a range of inertia to damping ratios.

Most current methods\nlearn injective embedding functions that map an instance to a single point in\nthe shared space. Unfortunately, injective embedding cannot effectively handle\npolysemous instances with multiple possible meanings; at best, it would find an\naverage representation of different meanings. This hinders its use in\nreal-world scenarios where individual instances and their cross-modal\nassociations are often ambiguous. In this work, we introduce Polysemous\nInstance Embedding Networks (PIE-Nets) that compute multiple and diverse\nrepresentations of an instance by combining global context with locally-guided\nfeatures via multi-head self-attention and residual learning. To learn\nvisual-semantic embedding, we tie-up two PIE-Nets and optimize them jointly in\nthe multiple instance learning framework.

A simple analysis of the spin-resolved\nlocal density of states of a free electrode allowed us to identify the Fe(110)\nas the most optimal electrode, providing perfect spin filtering and high\nconductance at the same time. These results are confirmed by $ab$ $initio$\nquantum transport calculations and are similar to those reported previously for\nmodel junctions.

This paper discusses the pros and\ncons of using Ethereum MainNet, the public Ethereum blockchain, as a\nCoordination Blockchain. The requirements Ethereum MainNet needs to fulfil to\nperform this role are discussed within the context of Ethereum Private\nSidechains, a private blockchain technology which allows many blockchains to be\noperated in parallel, and allows atomic crosschain transactions to execute\nacross blockchains. Ethereum MainNet is a permissionless network which aims to\noffer strong authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation properties, that\nincentivises good behaviour using crypto economics. This paper demonstrates\nthat Ethereum MainNet does deliver these properties. It then provides a\ncomprehensive review of the features of Ethereum Private Sidechains, with a\nfocus on the potential usage of Coordination Blockchains for these features.\nFinally, the merits of using Ethereum MainNet as a Coordination Blockchain are\nassessed.

We study whether the X-ray diffuse background (XDB)\nspectra estimated from the four deep fields collected over eight years, vary\nwith the integrated Earth's magnetic strength in the direction of each target\nfield at each observation epoch, which amounts to $10^2$ Tm-a value greater\nthan that achieved by terrestrial experiments due to the large coherent length.\nFrom the detailed analysis, we did not find evidence of the XDB confidence\nlevel spectra having dependence on the Earth's magnetic strength. We obtained\n99 % confidence level upper limit on a possible residual contribution to the\ncosmic X-ray background (CXB) surface brightness to be $1.6\\times 10^{-9}~{\\rm\nergs~s}^{-1}{\\rm cm}^{-2}{\\rm sr}^{-1}$ normalized at $10^4$ T${}^2$ m${}^2$ in\nthe 2-6 keV range, which corresponds to 6-15 % of the observed CXB brightness,\ndepending on which model of unresolved point sources are used in the\ninterpretation. It is consistent with 80-90 % of the CXB now being resolved\ninto point sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 08:07:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 05:09:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

We outline a reinforcement learning algorithm for the acquisition of the\nsyntactic morphology and arithmetic semantics of English numerals, based on\nminimalist grammar (MG), a recent computational implementation of generative\nlinguistics. Number words are presented to the agent by a teacher in form of\nutterance meaning pairs (UMP) where the meanings are encoded as arithmetic\nterms from a suitable term algebra. Since MG encodes universal linguistic\ncompetence through inference rules, thereby separating innate linguistic\nknowledge from the contingently acquired lexicon, our approach unifies\ngenerative grammar and reinforcement learning, hence potentially resolving the\nstill pending Chomsky-Skinner controversy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 08:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

We present results for a large class of problems\nthat reduce the determination of spectral stability of a wave to a simple task\nof locating zeros of explicitly constructed polynomials. We study spectral\nstability of small-amplitude periodic waves in scalar Hamiltonian problems as a\nperturbation of the zero-amplitude case. A necessary condition for stability of\nthe wave is that the unperturbed spectrum is restricted to the imaginary axis.\nInstability can come about through a Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcation, i.e., of a\ncollision of purely imaginary eigenvalues of the Floquet spectrum of opposite\nKrein signature. In recent work on the stability of small-amplitude waves the\ndispersion relation of the unperturbed problem was shown to play a central\nrole. We demonstrate that the dispersion relation provides even more explicit\ninformation about wave stability: we construct a polynomial of half the degree\nof the dispersion relation, and its roots directly characterize not only\ncollisions of eigenvalues at zero-amplitude but also an agreement or a\ndisagreement of their Krein signatures.

Unfortunately, existing work on grounding referring expressions\nfails to accurately extract multi-order relationships from the referring\nexpression and associate them with the objects and their related contexts in\nthe image.

To\ncapture the sequential dependencies, existing methods resort either to data\naugmentation techniques or left-to-right style autoregressive training.Since\nthese methods are aimed to model the sequential nature of user behaviors, they\nignore the future data of a target interaction when constructing the prediction\nmodel for it. However, we argue that the future interactions after a target\ninteraction, which are also available during training, provide valuable signal\non user preference and can be used to enhance the recommendation quality.\n  Properly integrating future data into model training, however, is non-trivial\nto achieve, since it disobeys machine learning principles and can easily cause\ndata leakage. To this end, we propose a new encoder-decoder framework named\nGap-filling based Recommender (GRec), which trains the encoder and decoder by a\ngap-filling mechanism. Specifically, the encoder takes a partially-complete\nsession sequence (where some items are masked by purpose) as input, and the\ndecoder predicts these masked items conditioned on the encoded representation.\nWe instantiate the general GRec framework using convolutional neural network\nwith sparse kernels, giving consideration to both accuracy and efficiency. We\nconduct experiments on two real-world datasets covering short-, medium-, and\nlong-range user sessions, showing that GRec significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods.

To\ndescribe nonlinear stability, initially, quadratic part of the Hamiltonian is\nnormalized in the neighborhood of triangular equilibrium point and then higher\norder normalization is performed. Due to the presence of perturbations and a\ntedious huge algebraic computation for intermediate terms, we have computed\nonly up to the fourth order normalized Hamiltonian using Lie transforms. In\nnon-resonance case, nonlinear stability of the system is discussed with the\nhelp of Arnold-Moser theorem.

Description of DIS in the small-x region\nrequires accounting for the both Q^2 and x -evolution at the same time.\nCombining DGLAP with total resummation of double logarithms of x and Q^2, we\npresent a description of structure function F_1 at large Q^2 and arbitrary x.\nMaking use of the necessity of the shift of Q^2 in order to regulate infrared\nsingularities, we obtain an expression for F_1 valid at arbitrary x and Q^2.\nThe obtained expressions coincide with the DLA expressions at small x and at\nthe same time coincides with the DGLAP result at large x and large Q^2.\nAccounting for virtualities k^2 of the external partons allows us to obtain\nexpressions for F_1 in K_T-Factorization, which are valid at arbitrary Q^2 and\narbitrary relations between Q^2 and k^2.

Various methods have been proposed in the\nliterature to compress trained CNNs. These include techniques like pruning\nweights, filter quantization and representing filters in terms of a basis\nfunctions. Our approach falls in this latter class of strategies, but is\ndistinct in that that we show both compressed learning and representation can\nbe achieved without significant modifications of popular CNN architectures.\nSpecifically, any convolution layer of the CNN is easily replaced by two\nsuccessive convolution layers: the first is a set of fixed filters (that\nrepresent the knowledge space of the entire layer and do not change), which is\nfollowed by a layer of one-dimensional filters (that represent the learned\nknowledge in this space). For the pre-trained networks, the fixed layer is just\nthe truncated eigen-decompositions of the original filters. The 1D filters are\ninitialized as the weights of linear combination, but are fine-tuned to recover\nany performance loss due to the truncation. For training networks from scratch,\nwe use a set of random orthogonal fixed filters (that never change), and learn\nthe 1D weight vector directly from the labeled data. Our method substantially\nreduces i) the number of learnable parameters during training, and ii) the\nnumber of multiplication operations and filter storage requirements during\nimplementation. It does so without requiring any special operators in the\nconvolution layer, and extends to all known popular CNN architectures.

Quite\nremarkably, it is shown that the high level of accuracy required on\ntwo-electron integrals to make Hartree-Fock (HF) and configuration interaction\n(CI) calculations feasible can be achieved. A first zero-variance estimator is\nbuilt by introducing a gaussian approximation of the orbitals and by evaluating\nthe two-electron integrals using a correlated sampling scheme for the\ndifference between exact and approximate orbitals.

These costs can be reduced by means of upsampling\ntechniques which tend to introduce artifacts and affect the visual quality of\nthe rendered image. This paper suggests a versatile approach for accelerating\nthe rendering of screen space methods while maintaining the visual quality.\nThis is achieved by exploiting the low frequency nature of many of these\nillumination methods and the geometrical continuity of the scene. First the\nscreen space is dynamically divided into separate sub-images, then the\nillumination is rendered for each sub-image in an adequate resolution and\nfinally the sub-images are put together in order to compose the final image.\nTherefore we identify edges in the scene and generate masks precisely\nspecifying which part of the image is included in which sub-image. The masks\ntherefore determine which part of the image is rendered in which resolution. A\nstep wise upsampling and merging process then allows optically soft transitions\nbetween the different resolution levels. For this paper, the introduced\nmulti-resolution rendering method was implemented and tested on three commonly\nused lighting methods. These are screen space ambient occlusion, soft shadow\nmapping and screen space global illumination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 13:23:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

One of the approaches is\nmulti-continuum technique, where every process in each continuum is modeled\nseparately and an interaction term is added. Direct numerical simulation in\nmulti scale media is usually not practicable. For this reason, one constructs\nthe corresponding homogenized equations. The paper develops a hierarchical\napproach for solving cell problems at a dense network of macroscopic points\nwith an essentially optimal computation cost. The method employs the fact that\nneighboring representative volume elements (RVEs) share similar features; and\neffective properties of the neighboring RVEs are close to each other. The\nhierarchical approach reduces computation cost by using different levels of\nresolution for cell problems at different macroscopic points.

To remedy this situation, weakly supervised methods leverage other forms\nof supervision that require substantially less annotation effort, but they\ntypically present an inability to predict precise object boundaries due to\napproximate nature of the supervisory signals in those regions. While great\nprogress has been made in improving the performance, many of these weakly\nsupervised methods are highly tailored to their own specific settings. This\nraises challenges in reusing algorithms and making steady progress. In this\npaper, we intentionally avoid such practices when tackling weakly supervised\nsemantic segmentation. In particular, we train standard neural networks with\npartial cross-entropy loss function for the labeled pixels and our proposed\nGated CRF loss for the unlabeled pixels. The Gated CRF loss is designed to\ndeliver several important assets: 1) it enables flexibility in the kernel\nconstruction to mask out influence from undesired pixel positions; 2) it\noffloads learning contextual relations to CNN and concentrates on semantic\nboundaries; 3) it does not rely on high-dimensional filtering and thus has a\nsimple implementation.

This leads to an\ninteresting question of whether controlling these quantities might improve the\ngeneralization behaviour of NNs. To this end, we propose stable rank\nnormalization (SRN), a novel, optimal, and computationally efficient\nweight-normalization scheme which minimizes the stable rank of a linear\noperator. Surprisingly we find that SRN, inspite of being non-convex problem,\ncan be shown to have a unique optimal solution. Moreover, we show that SRN\nallows control of the data-dependent empirical Lipschitz constant, which in\ncontrast to the Lipschitz upper-bound, reflects the true behaviour of a model\non a given dataset. We provide thorough analyses to show that SRN, when applied\nto the linear layers of a NN for classification, provides striking\nimprovements-11.3% on the generalization gap compared to the standard NN along\nwith significant reduction in memorization.

The\nclassification depends on the ground field, which we only assume to be perfect\nand not of characteristic 2. Our work uses the theory of representations of\npartially ordered sets with (order reversing) involution; for (co)isotropic\ntriples, the relevant poset is \"$2 + 2 + 2$\" consisting of three independent\nordered pairs, with the involution exchanging the members of each pair. A key\nfeature of the classification is that any indecomposable (co)isotropic triple\nis either \"split\" or \"non-split\". The latter is the case when the poset\nrepresentation underlying an indecomposable (co)isotropic triple is itself\nindecomposable. Otherwise, in the \"split\" case, the underlying representation\nis decomposable and necessarily the direct sum of a dual pair of indecomposable\nposet representations; the (co)isotropic triple is a \"symplectification\". In\nthe course of the paper we develop the framework of \"symplectic poset\nrepresentations\", which can be applied to a range of problems of symplectic\nlinear algebra. The classification of linear Hamiltonian vector fields, up to\nconjugation, is an example; we briefly explain the connection between these and\n(co)isotropic triples. The framework lends itself equally well to studying\nposet representations on spaces carrying a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear\nform; we mainly keep our focus, however, on the symplectic side.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 08:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-13"}
