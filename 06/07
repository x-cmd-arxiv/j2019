While\narchitectural advances have led to improved accuracy, building robust models\nremains challenging. Prior work has argued that there is an inherent trade-off\nbetween robustness and accuracy, which is exemplified by standard data augment\ntechniques such as Cutout, which improves clean accuracy but not robustness,\nand additive Gaussian noise, which improves robustness but hurts accuracy. To\novercome this trade-off, we introduce Patch Gaussian, a simple augmentation\nscheme that adds noise to randomly selected patches in an input image. Models\ntrained with Patch Gaussian achieve state of the art on the CIFAR-10 and\nImageNetCommon Corruptions benchmarks while also improving accuracy on clean\ndata. We find that this augmentation leads to reduced sensitivity to high\nfrequency noise(similar to Gaussian) while retaining the ability to take\nadvantage of relevant high frequency information in the image (similar to\nCutout). Finally, we show that Patch Gaussian can be used in conjunction with\nother regularization methods and data augmentation policies such as\nAutoAugment, and improves performance on the COCO object detection benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 17:54:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-07"}

Many numerical\nmethods for solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equations\nspecifying CLFs typically require dense state space discretizations and\nconsequently suffer from the curse of dimensionality. A relevant direction of\nattenuating the curse of dimensionality concerns reducing the computation of\nthe values of CLFs and associated feedbacks at any selected states to\nfinite-dimensional nonlinear programming problems. In this work, exit-time\noptimal control is used for that purpose. First, we state an exit-time optimal\ncontrol problem with respect to a sublevel set of an appropriate local CLF and\nestablish that, under a number of reasonable conditions, the concatenation of\nthe corresponding value function and the local CLF is a global CLF in the whole\ndomain of asymptotic null-controllability.

This article proposes a solution\nwithin the framework of probabilistic causal models, which extend\nhidden-variables theories, and then demonstrates an equivalence to the\ncontextuality-by-default (CbD) framework. CbD distinguishes contextuality from\ndirect influences of context on observables, defining the latter purely in\nterms of probability distributions. Here we take a causal view of direct\ninfluences, defining direct influence within any causal model as the\nprobability of all latent states of the system in which a change of context\nchanges the outcome of a measurement. Model-based contextuality\n(M-contextuality) is then defined as the necessity of stronger direct\ninfluences to model a full system than when considered individually. For\nconsistently connected systems, M-contextuality agrees with standard\ncontextuality. For general systems, it is proved that M-contextuality is\nequivalent to the property that any model of a system must contain \"hidden\ninfluences\", meaning direct influences that go in opposite directions for\ndifferent latent states, or equivalently signaling between observers that\ncarries no information. This criterion can be taken as formalizing the\n\"no-conspiracy\" principle that has been proposed in connection with CbD.\nM-contextuality is then proved to be equivalent to CbD-contextuality, thus\nproviding a new interpretation of CbD-contextuality as the non-existence of a\nmodel for a system without hidden direct influences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 17:35:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-07"}

I show that when STC\nis applied to systems of random variables, it can be recast in the language of\nthe Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) theory, and this allows one to extend STC to\narbitrary systems, in which the requirement in question (called \"consistent\nconnectedness'\" in CbD) is not necessarily satisfied.

The youngest Galactic supernova remnant G1.9+0.3 is an interesting\ntarget for next generation gamma-ray observatories. So far, the remnant is only\ndetected in the radio and the X-ray bands, but its young age of ~100 yrs and\ninferred shock speed of ~14,000 km/s could make it an efficient particle\naccelerator. Aims. We aim to model the observed radio and X-ray spectra\ntogether with the morphology of the remnant. At the same time, we aim to\nestimate the gamma-ray flux from the source and evaluated the prospects of its\ndetection with future gamma-ray experiments. Methods. We performed spherical\nsymmetric 1-D simulations with the RATPaC code, in which we simultaneously\nsolve the transport equation for cosmic rays, the transport equation for\nmagnetic turbulence, and the hydro-dynamical equations for the gas flow.\nSeparately computed distributions of the particles accelerated at the forward\nand the reverse shock are then used to calculate the spectra of synchrotron,\ninverse Compton, and pion-decay radiation from the source. Results. The\nemission from G1.9+0.3 can be self-consistently explained within the\ntest-particle limit. We find that the X-ray flux is dominated by emission from\nthe forward shock while most of the radio emission originates near the reverse\nshock, which makes G1.9+0.3 the first remnant with non-thermal radiation\ndetected from the reverse shock. The flux of very-high-energy gamma-ray\nemission from G1.9+0.3 is expected to be close to the sensitivity threshold of\nthe Cherenkov Telescope Array, CTA. The limited time available to grow\nlarge-scale turbulence limits the maximum energy of particles to values below\n100 TeV, hence G1.9+0.3 is not a PeVatron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 17:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

Disentangling these components via\ndetailed model fitting can thus be used to constrain the black hole spin, the\ngeometry and characteristics of the accretion flow, as well as of the outflows\nand surroundings of the black hole. We investigate how a high throughput high\nresolution X-ray spectrometer, such as the Athena X-ray Integral Field Unit\n(X-IFU) can be used to this aim, using the state of the art reflection model\nRelxill in a lamp post geometrical configuration. We simulate a representative\nsample of AGN spectra, including all necessary model complexities, as well as a\nrange of model parameters going from standard to more extreme values, and\nconsidered X-ray fluxes that are representative of known AGN and Quasars (QSOs)\npopulations. We also present a method to estimate the systematic errors related\nto the uncertainties in the calibration of the X-IFU. In a conservative\nsetting, in which the reflection component is computed self consistently by the\nRelxill model from the pre-set geometry and no iron over abundance, the mean\nerrors on the spin and height of the irradiating source are <0.05 and ~0.2 Rg.\nSimilarly the absorber parameters are measured to an accuracy typically less\nthan ~5%. Extending the simulations to include blue shifted ultra fast\noutflows, we show that X-IFU could measure their velocity with statistical\nerrors <1% even for high redshift objects (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 17:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

In\nparticular, how words in a sentence are abstracted into contexts by passing\nthrough the layers of the Transformer can be interpreted as approximating\nmultiple particles' movement in the space using the Lie-Trotter splitting\nscheme and the Euler's method. Given this ODE's perspective, the rich\nliterature of numerical analysis can be brought to guide us in designing\neffective structures beyond the Transformer. As an example, we propose to\nreplace the Lie-Trotter splitting scheme by the Strang-Marchuk splitting\nscheme, a scheme that is more commonly used and with much lower local\ntruncation errors. The Strang-Marchuk splitting scheme suggests that the\nself-attention and position-wise feed-forward network (FFN) sub-layers should\nnot be treated equally. Instead, in each layer, two position-wise FFN\nsub-layers should be used, and the self-attention sub-layer is placed in\nbetween. This leads to a brand new architecture. Such an FFN-attention-FFN\nlayer is \"Macaron-like\", and thus we call the network with this new\narchitecture the Macaron Net. Through extensive experiments, we show that the\nMacaron Net is superior to the Transformer on both supervised and unsupervised\nlearning tasks.

In this\nwork we assume that WGC holds for the microscopic Lagrangian so that $f <\nM_{Pl}$. However, inflation is controlled by an effective Lagrangian much below\nthe Planck scale where the inflaton is an effective axionic field associated\nwith an effective decay constant $f_e$ which could be very different from $f$.\nIn this work we propose a Coherent Enhancement Mechanism (CEM) for slow roll\ninflation controlled by flat potentials which can produce $f_e \\gg M_{Pl}$\nwhile $f < M_{Pl}$. In the analysis we consider a landscape of chiral fields\ncharged under a $U\\left(1\\right)$ global shift symmetry and consider breaking\nof the $U\\left(1\\right)$ symmetry by instanton type symmetry breaking terms. In\nthe broken phase there is one light pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-Boson (pNGB) which\nacts as the inflaton.

We discuss the utility of this mechanism for a\nvariety of inflaton models originating in supersymmetry and supergravity. The\nCoherent Enhancement Mechanism allows one to reduce an inflation model with an\narbitrary potential to an effective model of natural inflation, i.e. with a\nsingle cosine, by expanding the potential near a field point where horizon exit\noccurs, and matching the expansion coefficients to those of natural inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 18:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}

Extensive studies have shown that many amplifiers exist for the\nBirth-death Moran process, some of them substantially increasing the fixation\nprobability or even guaranteeing fixation in the limit of large population\nsize. On the other hand, no amplifiers are known for the death-Birth Moran\nprocess, and computer-assisted exhaustive searches have failed to discover\namplification. In this work we resolve this disparity, by showing that any\namplification under death-Birth updating is necessarily \\emph{bounded} and\n\\emph{transient}. Our boundedness result states that even if a population\nstructure does amplify selection, the resulting fixation probability is close\nto that of the well-mixed population.

In this survey we describe three popular finite element methods\nfor approximating solutions to the Laplace-Beltrami problem posed on an\n$n$-dimensional surface $\\gamma$ embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$: the\nparametric, trace, and narrow band methods. The parametric method entails\nconstructing an approximating polyhedral surface $\\Gamma$ whose faces comprise\nthe finite element triangulation. The finite element method is then posed over\nthe approximate surface $\\Gamma$ in a manner very similar to standard FEM on\nEuclidean domains. In the trace method it is assumed that the given surface\n$\\gamma$ is embedded in an $n+1$-dimensional domain $\\Omega$ which has itself\nbeen triangulated. An $n$-dimensional approximate surface $\\Gamma$ is then\nconstructed roughly speaking by interpolating $\\gamma$ over the triangulation\nof $\\Omega$, and the finite element space over $\\Gamma$ consists of the trace\n(restriction) of a standard finite element space on $\\Omega$ to $\\Gamma$.

Ultracold\nquantum gases have recently shown the appearance of the periodic order typical\nof a crystal, due to various types of controllable interactions. A crucial\nfeature of a D-dimensional supersolid is the occurrence of up to D+1 gapless\nexcitations reflecting the Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous\nbreaking of two continuous symmetries: the breaking of phase invariance,\ncorresponding to the locking of the phase of the atomic wave functions at the\norigin of superfluid phenomena, and the breaking of translational invariance\ndue to the lattice structure of the system. The occurrence of such modes has\nbeen the object of intense theoretical investigations, but their experimental\nobservation is still missing. Here we demonstrate the supersolid symmetry\nbreaking through the appearance of two distinct compressional oscillation modes\nin a harmonically trapped dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate, reflecting the\ngapless Goldstone excitations of the homogeneous system. We observe that the\ntwo modes have different natures, with the higher frequency mode associated\nwith an oscillation of the periodicity of the emergent lattice and the lower\none characterizing the superfluid oscillations.

We then train\nspiking networks which utilize IF neurons with and without noise and leakage,\nand experimentally confirm that the noisy networks are more robust.

These waves have a frequency of about half the\nlocal electron gyrofrequency. We also derive an analytic expression for the\noblique FM/W instability for $\\beta_{\\mathrm c}\\sim 1$. The comparison of our\ntheoretical results with data from the \\emph{Wind} spacecraft confirms the\nrelevance of the oblique FM/W instability for the solar wind.

In this paper, we aim to teach a machine how to make a pizza by\nbuilding a generative model that mirrors this step-by-step procedure. To do so,\nwe learn composable module operations which are able to either add or remove a\nparticular ingredient. Each operator is designed as a Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (GAN).

First,\nthe use of multi-scale approaches, i.e., encoder-decoder architectures, leads\nto a redundant use of information, where similar low-level features are\nextracted multiple times at multiple scales. Second, long-range feature\ndependencies are not efficiently modeled, resulting in non-optimal\ndiscriminative feature representations associated with each semantic class.

This approach is able to integrate local\nfeatures with their corresponding global dependencies, as well as highlight\ninterdependent channel maps in an adaptive manner.

However,\ncurrent diffusion models cannot capture transmissions occurring for indirect\ninteractions. For example, an airborne infected individual releases infectious\nparticles at locations that can suspend in the air and infect susceptible\nindividuals arriving even after the infected individual left. Thus, current\ndiffusion models miss transmissions during indirect interactions. In this\nthesis, a novel diffusion model called the same place different time\ntransmission based diffusion (SPDT) is introduced to take into account the\ntransmissions through indirect interactions. The behaviour of SPDT diffusion is\nanalysed on real dynamic contact networks and a significant amplification in\ndiffusion dynamics is observed. The SPDT model also introduces some novel\nbehaviours different from current diffusion models. In this work, a new SPDT\ngraph model is also developed to generate synthetic traces to explore SPDT\ndiffusion in several scenarios. The analysis shows that the emergence of new\ndiffusion becomes common thanks to the inclusion of indirect transmissions\nwithin the SPDT model. This work finally investigates how diffusion can be\ncontrolled and develops new methods to hinder diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 01:39:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}

Traditional methods to solve this problem are mainly\nbased on mathematical optimization techniques, where accurate channel state\ninformation (CSI), usually obtained through channel estimation and feedback, is\nneeded. To overcome the high computational complexity of the traditional\nmethods and eliminate the costly channel estimation stage, machine leaning (ML)\nhas been introduced recently to address the wireless link scheduling problems.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel graph embedding based method for link\nscheduling in D2D networks. We first construct a fully-connected directed graph\nfor the D2D network, where each D2D pair is a node while interference links\namong D2D pairs are the edges. Then we compute a low-dimensional feature vector\nfor each node in the graph. The graph embedding process is based on the\ndistances of both communication and interference links, therefore without\nrequiring the accurate CSI. By utilizing a multi-layer classifier, a scheduling\nstrategy can be learned in a supervised manner based on the graph embedding\nresults for each node. We also propose an unsupervised manner to train the\ngraph embedding based method to further reinforce the scalability and\ngeneralizability and develop a K-nearest neighbor graph representation method\nto reduce the computational complexity. Extensive simulation demonstrates that\nthe proposed method is near-optimal compared with the existing state-of-art\nmethods but is with only hundreds of training samples.

The proofs rely on estimates for the\nprobability that a random factor of a pseudorandom graph contains a given edge,\nwhich is of independent interest.\n  As applications, we obtain new results on the properties of random graphs\nwith given near-regular degree sequences, including Hamiltonicity and\nuniversality in subgraph containment. We also determine several graph\nparameters in these random graphs, such as the chromatic number, small subgraph\ncounts, the diameter, and the independence number. We are also able to\ncharacterise many phase transitions in edge percolation on these random graphs,\nsuch as the threshold for the appearance of a giant component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 03:36:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 21:22:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 22:37:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 09:40:36 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2022 14:10:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

The results characterize\nprecisely the contribution of the observations from the source distribution to\nthe classification task under the target distribution. A data-driven adaptive\nclassifier is then proposed and is shown to simultaneously attain within a\nlogarithmic factor of the optimal rate over a large collection of parameter\nspaces. Simulation studies and real data applications are carried out where the\nnumerical results further illustrate the theoretical analysis. Extensions to\nthe case of multiple source distributions are also considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 05:29:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}

Manual semantic analysis is time-consuming, because abstractions\nprovided by high level languages, such as type information, variable scope, or\ncomments are lost, and past analyses cannot apply to the current analysis task.\nExisting automated binary analysis tools currently suffer from low accuracy in\ndetermining semantic function identification in the presence of diverse\ncompilation environments.\n  We introduce Software Ethology, a binary analysis approach for determining\nthe semantic similarity of functions. Software Ethology abstracts semantic\nbehavior as classification vectors of program state changes resulting from a\nfunction executing with a specified input state, and uses these vectors as a\nunique fingerprint for identification. All existing semantic identifiers\ndetermine function similarity via code measurements, and suffer from high\ninaccuracy when classifying functions from compilation environments different\nfrom their ground truth source. Since Software Ethology does not rely on code\nmeasurements, its accuracy is resilient to changes in compiler, compiler\nversion, optimization level, or even different source implementing equivalent\nfunctionality.\n  Tinbergen, our prototype Software Ethology implementation, leverages a\nvirtual execution environment and a fuzzer to generate the classification\nvectors.

Selfie generalizes the concept of masked language\nmodeling of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) to continuous data, such as images, by\nmaking use of the Contrastive Predictive Coding loss (Oord et al., 2018). Given\nmasked-out patches in an input image, our method learns to select the correct\npatch, among other \"distractor\" patches sampled from the same image, to fill in\nthe masked location. This classification objective sidesteps the need for\npredicting exact pixel values of the target patches. The pretraining\narchitecture of Selfie includes a network of convolutional blocks to process\npatches followed by an attention pooling network to summarize the content of\nunmasked patches before predicting masked ones. During finetuning, we reuse the\nconvolutional weights found by pretraining. We evaluate Selfie on three\nbenchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet 32 x 32, and ImageNet 224 x 224) with varying\namounts of labeled data, from 5% to 100% of the training sets.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of generalized few-shot\nlearning (GFSL) -- a model during the deployment is required to learn about\ntail categories with few shots and simultaneously classify the head classes.

As a consequence, ACASTLE can handle GFSL with\nclasses from heterogeneous domains effectively.

Furthermore, we will circumvent several important\nlimitations that have been found in the literature: 1) Models are evaluated\nshortly before sepsis onset without considering interventions already\ninitiated. 2) Machine learning models are built on a restricted set of clinical\nparameters, which are not necessarily measured in all departments. 3) Model\nperformance is limited by current knowledge of sepsis, as feature interactions\nand time dependencies are hardcoded into the model. In this study, we present a\nmodel to overcome these shortcomings using a deep learning approach on a\ndiverse multicenter data set. We used retrospective data from multiple Danish\nhospitals over a seven-year period. Our sepsis detection system is constructed\nas a combination of a convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory\nnetwork. We suggest a retrospective assessment of interventions by looking at\nintravenous antibiotics and blood cultures preceding the prediction time.\nResults show performance ranging from AUROC 0.856 (3 hours before sepsis onset)\nto AUROC 0.756 (24 hours before sepsis onset). We present a deep learning\nsystem for early detection of sepsis that is able to learn characteristics of\nthe key factors and interactions from the raw event sequence data itself,\nwithout relying on a labor-intensive feature extraction work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 08:38:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}

The\nproposed lean testing process uses Machine Learning as a supporting machine,\nwhile keeping the human test manager in charge of the adequate test case\nselection. 1 Introduction Many established long running projects and programs\nare execute regression tests during the release tests. The regression tests are\nthe part of the release test to ensure that functionality from past releases\nstill works fine in the new release. In many projects, a significant part of\nthese regression tests are not automated and therefore executed manually.\nManual tests are expensive and time intensive [1], which is why often only a\nrelevant subset of all possible regression tests are executed in order to safe\ntime and money. Depending on the software process, different approaches can be\nused to identify the right set of regression tests. The source code file level\nis a frequent entry point for this identification [2]. Advanced approaches\ncombine different file level methods [3]. To handle black-box tests, methods\nlike [4] or [5] can be used for test case prioritiza-tion. To decide which\ntests can be skipped, a relevance ranking of the tests in a regression test\nsuite is needed. Based on the relevance a test is in or out of the regression\ntest set for a specific release. This decision is a task of the test manager\nsupported by experts. The task can be time-consuming in case of big (often a\n4-to 5-digit number) regression test suites because the selection is specific\nto each release. Trends are going to continuous prioritization [6], which this\nwork wants to support with the presented ML based approach for black box\nregression test case prioritization. Any regression test selection is made upon\nrelease specific changes. Changes can be new or deleted code based on\nrefactoring or implementation of new features. But also changes on externals\nsystems which are connected by interfaces have to be considered\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 09:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}

The particle escapes\nfrom its trap when the ambient pressure becomes comparable with or smaller than\na critical value, even if the particle motion is cooled by one of the feedback\n(or cavity) cooling schemes realized so far. The critical ambient pressure may\nbe so small that it is not a limiting factor in ground-state cooling, but\ncritical feedback cooling rates, which are also introduced, are limiting\nfactors. The particle escapes from its trap if any of the feedback cooling\nrates becomes comparable with or larger than its critical value. Critical\nfeedback cooling rate is different from the well-known manifestation of the\nmeasurement noise. The critical feedback cooling rate corresponding to a\ncertain component of the particle motion is usually smaller than the optimum\nfeedback cooling rate at which the standard quantum limit happens unless that\ncomponent is cooled by the Coulomb force (instead of the optical gradient\nforce). Also, given that the measurement noise for the z component is smaller\nthan the measurement noises for the other two components (assuming that the\nbeam illuminating the particle for photodetection propagates parallel to the z\naxis), the feedback scheme in which the z component of the particle motion is\ncooled by the Coulomb force has the best performance.

For fermions we find that the\ndecay lengths correlate with the inverse of the overall neutrino mass scale.\nThus, since no lower limit on the lightest neutrino mass exists, nearly\narbitrarily long decay lengths can be obtained for the case where fermions are\nthe lighter of the heavy particles. For charged scalars, on the other hand,\nthere exists a maximum value for the decay length. This maximum value depends\non the model and on the electric charge of the scalar under consideration, but\ncan at most be of the order of a few millimeters. Interestingly, independent of\nthe model, this maximum occurs always in a region of parameter space, where\nleptonic and gauge boson final states have similar branching ratios, i.e. where\nthe observation of lepton number violating final states from scalar decays is\npossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 12:01:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 16:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

This paper presents a novel method,\nnamed coherent point drift networks (CPD-Net), for the unsupervised learning of\ngeometric transformation towards real-time non-rigid point set registration. In\ncontrast to previous efforts (e.g. coherent point drift), CPD-Net can learn\ndisplacement field function to estimate geometric transformation from a\ntraining dataset, consequently, to predict the desired geometric transformation\nfor the alignment of previously unseen pairs without any additional iterative\noptimization process.

Training feature extraction models requires additional\nannotated language resources, which severely restricts the applicability and\nportability of relation extraction to novel languages. Similarly,\npre-processing introduces an additional source of error. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce TRE, a Transformer for Relation Extraction, extending\nthe OpenAI Generative Pre-trained Transformer [Radford et al., 2018]. Unlike\nprevious relation extraction models, TRE uses pre-trained deep language\nrepresentations instead of explicit linguistic features to inform the relation\nclassification and combines it with the self-attentive Transformer architecture\nto effectively model long-range dependencies between entity mentions. TRE\nallows us to learn implicit linguistic features solely from plain text corpora\nby unsupervised pre-training, before fine-tuning the learned language\nrepresentations on the relation extraction task. TRE obtains a new\nstate-of-the-art result on the TACRED and SemEval 2010 Task 8 datasets,\nachieving a test F1 of 67.4 and 87.1, respectively.

To achieve\nmeaningful human-computer and human-robot interactions, multi-modal models of\nthe users states (e.g., engagement) are therefore needed. Most of the existing\nworks that try to build classifiers for the users states assume that the data\nto train the models are fully labeled. Nevertheless, data labeling is costly\nand tedious, and also prone to subjective interpretations by the human coders.\nThis is even more pronounced when the data are multi-modal (e.g., some users\nare more expressive with their facial expressions, some with their voice).\nThus, building models that can accurately estimate the users states during an\ninteraction is challenging. To tackle this, we propose a novel multi-modal\nactive learning (AL) approach that uses the notion of deep reinforcement\nlearning (RL) to find an optimal policy for active selection of the users data,\nneeded to train the target (modality-specific) models. We investigate different\nstrategies for multi-modal data fusion, and show that the proposed model-level\nfusion coupled with RL outperforms the feature-level and modality-specific\nmodels, and the naive AL strategies such as random sampling, and the standard\nheuristics such as uncertainty sampling. We show the benefits of this approach\non the task of engagement estimation from real-world child-robot interactions\nduring an autism therapy.

An exemplar for these approaches is Breadth-First Search (BFS).\nThe algebraic BFS algorithm is simply a recurrence of matrix-vector\nmultiplications with the $n \\times n$ adjacency matrix, but the many redundant\noperations over nonzeros ultimately lead to suboptimal performance. Therefore\nan optimal algebraic BFS should be of keen interest especially if it is easily\nintegrated with existing matrix methods.\n  Current methods, notably in the GraphBLAS, use a Sparse Matrix masked-Sparse\nVector (SpMmSpV) multiplication in which the input vector is kept in a sparse\nrepresentation in each step of the BFS, and nonzeros in the vector are masked\nin subsequent steps. This has been an area of recent research in GraphBLAS and\nother libraries. While in theory these masking methods are asymptotically\noptimal on sparse graphs, many add work that leads to suboptimal runtime. We\ngive a new optimal, algebraic BFS for sparse graphs, thus closing a gap in the\nliterature.\n  Our method multiplies progressively smaller submatrices of the adjacency\nmatrix at each step. Let $n$ and $m$ refer to the number of vertices and edges,\nrespectively. On a sparse graph, our method takes $O(n)$ algebraic operations\nas opposed to $O(m)$ operations needed by theoretically optimal sparse matrix\napproaches. Thus for sparse graphs it matches the bounds of the best-known\nsequential algorithm and on a Parallel Random Access Machine (PRAM) it is\nwork-optimal. Our result holds for both directed and undirected graphs.\nCompared to a leading GraphBLAS library our method achieves up to 24x faster\nsequential time and for parallel computation it can be 17x faster on large\ngraphs and 12x faster on large-diameter graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 14:06:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 14:43:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 19:33:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 21:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

We propose a\ngeneral framework for multivariate conditional transformation models that\novercomes these limitations and describes the entire distribution in a\ntractable and interpretable yet flexible way conditional on nonlinear effects\nof covariates. The framework can be embedded into likelihood-based inference,\nincluding results on asymptotic normality, and allows the dependence structure\nto vary with covariates. In addition, the framework scales well beyond\nbivariate response situations, which were the main focus of most earlier\ninvestigations.

Design: A deep learning model\nwas developed to detect the presence of GA in color fundus photographs, and two\nadditional models to detect CGA in different scenarios. Participants: 59,812\ncolor fundus photographs from longitudinal follow up of 4,582 participants in\nthe AREDS dataset. Gold standard labels were from human expert reading center\ngraders using a standardized protocol. Methods: A deep learning model was\ntrained to use color fundus photographs to predict GA presence from a\npopulation of eyes with no AMD to advanced AMD. A second model was trained to\npredict CGA presence from the same population. A third model was trained to\npredict CGA presence from the subset of eyes with GA. For training and testing,\n5-fold cross-validation was employed. For comparison with human clinician\nperformance, model performance was compared with that of 88 retinal\nspecialists. Results: The deep learning models (GA detection, CGA detection\nfrom all eyes, and centrality detection from GA eyes) had AUC of 0.933-0.976,\n0.939-0.976, and 0.827-0.888, respectively.

Such extreme winds are\ntypically generated by extratropical cyclone systems originating in the North\nAtlantic and passing over Europe. Previous statistical studies tend to model\nextreme winds at a given set of sites, corresponding to inference in a Eulerian\nframework. Such inference cannot incorporate knowledge of the life cycle and\nprogression of extratropical cyclones across the region and is forced to make\nrestrictive assumptions about the extremal dependence structure. We take an\nentirely different approach which overcomes these limitations by working in a\nLagrangian framework. Specifically, we model the development of windstorms over\ntime, preserving the physical characteristics linking the windstorm and the\ncyclone track, the path of local vorticity maxima, and make a key finding that\nthe spatial extent of extratropical windstorms becomes more localised as its\nmagnitude increases irrespective of the location of the storm track. Our model\nallows simulation of synthetic windstorm events to derive the joint\ndistributional features over any set of sites giving physically consistent\nextrapolations to rarer events. From such simulations improved estimates of\nthis hazard can be achieved both in terms of intensity and area affected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 15:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}

To reduce the need for dense annotations, we\npropose a PoseWarper network that leverages training videos with sparse\nannotations (every k frames) to learn to perform dense temporal pose\npropagation and estimation. Given a pair of video frames---a labeled Frame A\nand an unlabeled Frame B---we train our model to predict human pose in Frame A\nusing the features from Frame B by means of deformable convolutions to\nimplicitly learn the pose warping between A and B. We demonstrate that we can\nleverage our trained PoseWarper for several applications. First, at inference\ntime we can reverse the application direction of our network in order to\npropagate pose information from manually annotated frames to unlabeled frames.\nThis makes it possible to generate pose annotations for the entire video given\nonly a few manually-labeled frames. Compared to modern label propagation\nmethods based on optical flow, our warping mechanism is much more compact (6M\nvs 39M parameters), and also more accurate (88.7% mAP vs 83.8% mAP).

Predicting run time is challenging, however. The inputs\nto scientific codes can be complex and high dimensional. Their relationship to\nthe run time may be highly non-linear, and, in the most general case is\ncompletely arbitrary and thus unpredictable (i.e., simply a random mapping from\ninputs to run time). Most codes are not so arbitrary, however, and there has\nbeen significant prior research on predicting the run time of applications and\nworkloads. Such predictions are generally application-specific, however. In\nthis paper, we focus on the Gaussian computational chemistry code.

However, existing approaches can only exploit\nthe exercising records of students, and the problem of extracting rich\ninformation existed in the exercise's materials (e.g., knowledge concepts,\nexercise content) to achieve both precise predictions of student performance\nand interpretable analysis of knowledge acquisition remains underexplored. In\nthis paper, we present a holistic study of student performance prediction. To\ndirectly achieve the primary goal of prediction, we first propose a general\nExercise-Enhanced Recurrent Neural Network (EERNN) framework by exploring both\nstudent's records and the exercise contents. In EERNN, we simply summarize each\nstudent's state into an integrated vector and trace it with a recurrent neural\nnetwork, where we design a bidirectional LSTM to learn the encoding of each\nexercise's content. For making predictions, we propose two implementations\nunder EERNN with different strategies, i.e., EERNNM with Markov property and\nEERNNA with Attention mechanism. Then, to explicitly track student's knowledge\nacquisition on multiple knowledge concepts, we extend EERNN to an explainable\nExercise-aware Knowledge Tracing (EKT) by incorporating the knowledge concept\neffects, where the student's integrated state vector is extended to a knowledge\nstate matrix. In EKT, we further develop a memory network for quantifying how\nmuch each exercise can affect the mastery of students on concepts during the\nexercising process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on large-scale\nreal-world data. The results demonstrate the prediction effectiveness of two\nframeworks as well as the superior interpretability of EKT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 08:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

Today, there is an\nenhanced emphasis on developing new experimental techniques to capture the\nlocal temperature profiles in gases at rarefied conditions. The main underlying\nreason behind this focus is the interesting physics exhibited by gases at these\nrarefied conditions, especially in the transition regime. There is the onset of\nlocal thermodynamic disequilibrium, which manifests as velocity slip and\ntemperature jump [1-4] at the wall. However, there is limited experimental\nevidence on understanding these aforementioned phenomena. With the advances in\nexperimental facilities, it is today possible, at least in principle, to map\nthe local temperature profiles in gases at rarefied conditions. Molecular\ntagging approach is one such technique which has shown the potential to map the\ntemperature profile in low pressure conditions [5]. In molecular tagging\napproach, a very small percentage of tracer molecules are introduced into the\ngas of interest, referred as carrier gas. In gas flow studies, the typical\ntracers employed are acetone and biacetyl. These tracer molecules, assumed to\nbe in equilibrium with the carrier gas, are excited with a source of energy at\na specific wavelength, typically a laser. The excited molecules are unstable\nand tend to de-excite in a radiative and non-radiative manner, which is\nmanifested as fluorescence and phosphorescence. Following the deformation with\ntime of a tagged line permits to obtain the flow velocity. In addition, the\ndependence of the phosphorescence and fluorescence intensity to the gas\ntemperature could also allow to use this technique for local temperature\nmeasurements. The objective of this study is to develop an experimental setup\ncapable of simultaneously mapping the wall and fluid near-wall temperatures\nwith the final goal to measure temperature jump at the wall when rarefied\nconditions are reached.
