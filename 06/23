We can point out many\nobjective reasons for this. On the one hand, users require services, mainly at\ntheir location, and on the other hand, location determination has become easy,\nespecially due to the proliferation of smartphones. But at the same time, the\nactual geo-calculation are not needed by most of these services. For the\nmajority of geo-services, geo-coordinates are used only for searching and\norganizing data. And the meaning of the service is to search for information\ntied to the current location of the requesting party. In other words, in most\ncases, service refers to data near the current location. So, our idea is to\nbuild services directly on assessing to proximity and completely bypass\ngeo-calculations. It also opens the way for completely new services that were\nimpossible or difficult to implement with geo-computations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 2019 16:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

However, finding solutions\nof Maxwell's equations is an extremely difficult task. Therefore, various\nsimplifying approaches are often used in optics. One such simplifying approach\nis to use the approximation of geometric optics. The approximation of geometric\noptics is constructed with the assumption that the wavelengths are small\n(short-wavelength approximation). The basis of geometric optics is the eikonal\nequation. The eikonal equation can be obtained from the wave equation\n(Helmholtz equation). Thus, the eikonal equation relates the wave and geometric\noptics. In fact, the eikonal equation is a quasi-classical approximation (the\nWentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method) of wave optics. This paper shows the\napplication of geometric methods of electrodynamics to the calculation of\noptical devices, such as Maxwell and Luneburg lenses.

We\nformulate nonparametric density estimation on a network as a nonparametric\nregression problem by binning. Nonparametric regression using local polynomial\nkernel-weighted least squares have been studied rigorously, and its asymptotic\nproperties make it superior to kernel estimators such as the Nadaraya-Watson\nestimator. When applied to a network, the best estimator near a vertex depends\non the amount of smoothness at the vertex. Often, there are no compelling\nreasons to assume that a density will be continuous or discontinuous at a\nvertex, hence a data driven approach is proposed. To estimate the density in a\nneighborhood of a vertex, we propose a two-step procedure. The first step of\nthis pretest estimator fits a separate local polynomial regression on each edge\nusing data only on that edge, and then tests for equality of the estimates at\nthe vertex. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, then the second step\nre-estimates the regression function in a small neighborhood of the vertex,\nsubject to a joint equality constraint. Since the derivative of the density may\nbe discontinuous at the vertex, we propose a piecewise polynomial local\nregression estimate to model the change in slope. We study in detail the\nspecial case of local piecewise linear regression and derive the leading bias\nand variance terms using weighted least squares theory. We show that the\nproposed approach will remove the bias near a vertex that has been noted for\nexisting methods, which typically do not allow for discontinuity at vertices.\nFor a fixed network, the proposed method scales sub-linearly with sample size\nand it can be extended to regression and varying coefficient models on a\nnetwork. We demonstrate the workings of the proposed model by simulation\nstudies and apply it to a dendrite network data set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 2019 17:22:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 18:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-06"}

Although it has\nbeen argued that these externalities create incentives to under-invest in\nsecurity, this presumption is challenged by the possibility of strategic\nadversaries that attack the least protected agents. In this paper we study a\nnew model of security games in which agents share tokens of sensitive\ninformation in a network of contacts. The agents have the opportunity to invest\nin security to protect against an attack that can be either strategically or\nrandomly targeted. We show that, in the presence of random attack,\nunder-investments always prevail at the Nash equilibrium in comparison with the\nsocial optimum. Instead, when the attack is strategic, either under-investments\nor over-investments are possible, depending on the network topology and on the\ncharacteristics of the process of the spreading of information. Actually,\nagents invest more in security than socially optimal when dependencies among\nagents are low (which can happen because the information network is sparsely\nconnected or because the probability that information tokens are shared is\nsmall). These over-investments pass on to under-investments when information\nsharing is more likely (and therefore, when the risk brought by the attack is\nhigher).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 2019 19:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

Over the past decades,\nnumerous models for ENSO prediction have been developed, among which\nstatistical models approximating ENSO evolution by linear dynamics have\nreceived significant attention owing to their simplicity and comparable\nforecast skill to first-principles models at short lead times. Yet, due to\nhighly nonlinear and chaotic dynamics (particularly during ENSO initiation),\nsuch models have limited skill for longer-term forecasts beyond half a year. To\nresolve this limitation, here we employ a new nonparametric statistical\napproach based on analog forecasting, called kernel analog forecasting (KAF),\nwhich avoids assumptions on the underlying dynamics through the use of for\nnonlinear kernel methods for machine learning and dimension reduction of\nhigh-dimensional datasets.

In\nthe massive MIMO architecture, each base station (BS) detects only the users\nfrom its own cell while treating inter-cell interference as noise. In the\ncooperative MIMO architecture, each BS detects the users from neighboring cells\nas well; the detection results are then forwarded in the form of log-likelihood\nratio (LLR) to a central unit where final decisions are made.

To do this,\na controller is developed that has two modes of operation: (1) normal mode, and\n(2) drift mode. In the normal mode the vehicle's thrust and sensor limitations\nare not exceeded by environmental conditions, whereas in the drift mode they\nare. In the drift mode, a drift frame that moves with the prevailing wind is\nestablished in which the vehicle maintains control authority to generate and\ntrack trajectories. The vehicle maintains control authority by relaxing the\ninertial frame trajectory tracking requirement and re-planning the trajectory\nin the drift frame.

Recent proposals such as gradient-based methods or\none-shot approaches significantly boost the efficiency of NAS. In this paper,\nwe formulate the NAS problem from a Bayesian perspective. We propose explicitly\nestimating the joint posterior distribution over pairs of network architecture\nand weights. Accordingly, a hybrid network representation is presented which\nenables us to leverage the Variational Dropout so that the approximation of the\nposterior distribution becomes fully gradient-based and highly efficient. A\nposterior-guided sampling method is then presented to sample architecture\ncandidates and directly make evaluations. As a Bayesian approach, our\nposterior-guided NAS (PGNAS) avoids tuning a number of hyper-parameters and\nenables a very effective architecture sampling in posterior probability space.\nInterestingly, it also leads to a deeper insight into the weight sharing used\nin the one-shot NAS and naturally alleviates the mismatch between the sampled\narchitecture and weights caused by the weight sharing. We validate our PGNAS\nmethod on the fundamental image classification task. Results on Cifar-10,\nCifar-100 and ImageNet show that PGNAS achieves a good trade-off between\nprecision and speed of search among NAS methods.

The time delay (years to\ndecades) between the SN and the QN and, the fragmented nature (i.e. millions of\nchunks) of the relativistic QN ejecta are key to yielding a robust LGRB engine.\nIn our model, a LGRB light-curve exhibits the interaction of the fragmented QN\nejecta with a turbulent (i.e. filamentary and magnetically saturated) SN ejecta\nwhich is shaped by its interaction with an underlying pulsar wind nebula (PWN).\nThe afterglow is due to the interaction of the QN chunks, exiting the SN\nejecta, with the surrounding medium. Our model can fit BAT/XRT prompt and\nafterglow light-curves, simultaneously with their spectra, thus yielding the\nobserved properties of LGRBs (e.g. the Band function and the X-ray flares). We\nfind that the Yonetoku law and the Amati law are not fundamental but\nphenomenological. FRBs result from coherent synchrotron emission when the QN\nchunks interact with non-turbulent weakly magnetized PWN-SN ejecta, where\nconditions are prone to the Weibel instability. Magnetic field amplification\ninduced by the Weibel instability sets the bunching length for electrons and\npairs to radiate coherently. The resulting emission frequency, luminosity,\nduration and dispersion measure in our model are consistent with FRB data. We\nfind a natural unification of high-energy burst phenomena from FRBs to LGRBs\nincluding X-ray Flashes and X-ray rich GRBs as well as Super-Luminous SNe.

Different from existing neural vocoders such as WaveNet,\nSampleRNN and WaveRNN which directly generate waveform samples using single\nneural networks, the HiNet vocoder is composed of an amplitude spectrum\npredictor (ASP) and a phase spectrum predictor (PSP). The ASP is a simple DNN\nmodel which predicts log amplitude spectra (LAS) from acoustic features. The\npredicted LAS are sent into the PSP for phase recovery. Considering the issue\nof phase warping and the difficulty of phase modeling, the PSP is constructed\nby concatenating a neural source-filter (NSF) waveform generator with a phase\nextractor. We also introduce generative adversarial networks (GANs) into both\nASP and PSP. Finally, the outputs of ASP and PSP are combined to reconstruct\nspeech waveforms by short-time Fourier synthesis. Since there are no\nautoregressive structures in both predictors, the HiNet vocoder can generate\nspeech waveforms with high efficiency. Objective and subjective experimental\nresults show that our proposed HiNet vocoder achieves better naturalness of\nreconstructed speech than the conventional STRAIGHT vocoder, a 16-bit WaveNet\nvocoder using open source implementation and an NSF vocoder with similar\ncomplexity to the PSP and obtains similar performance with a 16-bit WaveRNN\nvocoder. We also find that the performance of HiNet is insensitive to the\ncomplexity of the neural waveform generator in PSP to some extend. After\nsimplifying its model structure, the time consumed for generating 1s waveforms\nof 16kHz speech using a GPU can be further reduced from 0.34s to 0.19s without\nsignificant quality degradation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jun 2019 10:01:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 11:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-06"}

The first level\nguides the agents to single out exclusive target nodes on a topological map.\nThis target selection relies on a shared idleness representation and a\ncoordination mechanism preventing topological conflicts. The second level hosts\ncoordination strategies based on a metric representation of space and is\nsupported by a 3D SLAM system. Here, each robot path planner negotiates spatial\nconflicts by applying a multi-robot traversability function. Continuous\ninteractions between these two levels ensure coordination and conflicts\nresolution. Both simulations and real-world experiments are presented to\nvalidate the performances of the proposed patrolling strategy in 3D\nenvironments. Results show this is a promising solution for managing spatial\nconflicts and preventing deadlocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jun 2019 12:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

For high\ndimensional temporal-spatial models, classical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nmethods are often slow to converge, and it is necessary to apply\nMetropolis-within-Gibbs (MwG) sampling on parameter blocks. However, the\ncomputation cost of each MwG iteration is typically $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the\nmodel dimension. This can be too expensive in practice. This paper introduces a\nnew reduced computation method to bring down the computation cost to $O(n)$,\nfor the inverse initial value problem of a stochastic differential equation\n(SDE) with local interactions. The key observation is that each MwG proposal is\nonly different from the original iterate at one parameter block, and this\ndifference will only propagate within a local domain in the SDE computations.\nTherefore we can approximate the global SDE computation with a surrogate\nupdated only within the local domain for reduced computation cost.

We discuss how to implement the local\ncomputation scheme using Euler--Maruyama and 4th order Runge--Kutta methods.

Medical image reconstruction is one of the most\nfundamental and important components of medical imaging, whose major objective\nis to acquire high-quality medical images for clinical usage at minimal cost\nand risk to the patients. Mathematical models in medical image reconstruction\nor, more generally, image restoration in computer vision, have been playing a\nprominent role. Earlier mathematical models are mostly designed by human\nknowledge or hypothesis on the image to be reconstructed, and we shall call\nthese models handcrafted models. Later, handcrafted plus data-driven modeling\nstarted to emerge which still mostly relies on human designs, while part of the\nmodel is learned from the observed data. More recently, as more data and\ncomputation resources are made available, deep learning based models (or deep\nmodels) pushed data-driven modeling to the extreme where the models are mostly\nbased on learning with minimal human designs. Both handcrafted and data-driven\nmodeling have their own advantages and disadvantages. One of the major research\ntrends in medical imaging is to combine handcrafted modeling with deep modeling\nso that we can enjoy benefits from both approaches. The major part of this\narticle is to provide a conceptual review of some recent works on deep modeling\nfrom the unrolling dynamics viewpoint. This viewpoint stimulates new designs of\nneural network architectures with inspiration from optimization algorithms and\nnumerical differential equations. Given the popularity of deep modeling, there\nare still vast remaining challenges in the field, as well as opportunities\nwhich we shall discuss at the end of this article.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jun 2019 06:57:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2022 07:06:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2022 03:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

A Hu-Washizu-type functional is\nextremized in order to obtain a mixed formulation for nonlinear elasticity. The\nindependent fields of the mixed formulations are the displacement, the\ndisplacement gradient, and the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress. A pressure-like\nfield is also introduced in the case of incompressible elasticity. We define\nthe displacement in $H^1$, the displacement gradient in $H(curl)$, the stress\nin $H(div)$, and the pressure-like field in $L^2$. In this setting, for\nimproving the stability of the proposed finite element methods without\ncompromising their consistency, we consider some stabilizing terms in the\nHu-Washizu-type functional that vanish at its critical points. Using a\nconforming interpolation, the solution and the test spaces are approximated\nwith some piecewise polynomial subspaces of them. In three dimensions, this\nrequires using the N\\'ed\\'elec edge elements for the displacement gradient and\nthe N\\'ed\\'elec face elements for the stress. This approach results in mixed\nfinite element methods that satisfy the Hadamard jump condition and the\ncontinuity of traction on all internal faces of the mesh. This, in particular,\nmakes CSFEMs quite efficient for modeling heterogeneous solids. We assess the\nperformance of CSFEMs by solving several numerical examples, and demonstrate\ntheir good performance for bending problems, for bodies with complex\ngeometries, and in the near-incompressible and the incompressible regimes.\nUsing CSFEMs, one can capture very large strains and accurately approximate\nstresses and the pressure field. Moreover, in our numerical examples, we do not\nobserve any numerical artifacts such as checkerboarding of pressure, hourglass\ninstability, or locking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jun 2019 04:09:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

Minute amounts of long chain polymers added to\nwater has been known to arrest the droplet rebound effect on superhydrophobic\nsurfaces. Previous studies have attributed different reasons like extensional\nviscosity, dominance of elastic stresses or slowing down of contact line in\nretraction phase due to stretching of polymer chains. The present study\nattempts to unravel the existence of critical criteria of polymer concentration\nand impact velocity on the inhibition of droplet rebound. The impact velocity\nwill indirectly influence the shear rate during the retraction phase, and the\npolymer concentration dictates the relaxation timescale of the elastic fluids.\nFinally we show that the Weissenberg number (at onset of retraction), which\nquantifies both the elastic effects of polymer chains and the hydrodynamics, is\nthe critical parameter in determining the regime of onset of rebound\nsuppression, and that there exists a critical value which determines the onset\nof bounce arrest. The previous three causes, which are manifestations of\nelastic effects in non-Newtonian fluids, can be related with the proposed\nWeissenberg number criterion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jun 2019 07:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}
