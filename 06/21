The full-field simulations reveal in\ngreat detail the pinning and de-pinning of a twin boundary at individual\nprecipitates, resulting in a maximum resistance to twin growth when the\nprecipitate is partially embedded in the twin. Furthermore, statistically\nrepresentative precipitate distributions are used to systematically investigate\nthe influence of key microstructural parameters such as precipitate\norientation, volume fraction, size, and aspect ratio on the resistance to twin\ngrowth.

For a constant volume fraction of precipitates, reduction of the\nprecipitate size below a critical level produces a strong increase in the CRSS\ndue to the Orowan-like strengthening mechanism between the twin interface and\nprecipitates.

The\nmodel employs a ${\\rm U(1)}_{\\rm weak} \\times {\\rm U(1)}_{\\rm strong}$\neffective gauge field theory under which electrons and monopoles (assumed to be\nfermions) are appropriately charged. The non-perturbative quantum effects of\nthe strongly coupled sector of the theory lead to dressed effective couplings\nof the monopole/dyon with the electromagnetic photon, due to non-trivial\nwave-function renormalization effects. For slowly-moving monopole/dyons, such\neffects lead to weak coupling, thus turning the bare non-perturbative magnetic\ncharge, which is large due to the Dirac/Schwinger quantization rule, into a\nperturbative effective, velocity-(\"$\\beta$\")-dependent magnetic coupling.

Whilst both keyframe and sparse\nkeypoint matching methods can be used online, the former often fail away from\nthe training trajectory, and the latter can struggle in textureless regions. By\ncontrast, scene coordinate regression (SCoRe) methods generalise to novel poses\nand can leverage dense correspondences to improve robustness, and recent work\nhas shown how to adapt SCoRe forests between scenes, allowing their\nstate-of-the-art performance to be leveraged online.

In this paper, we address this by proposing a novel way of leveraging\na network trained on one scene to predict points in another scene.

Existing\nmethods can be categorized into two groups: (1) the first group learns two\nseparated node representations from network structure and node attribute\nrespectively and concatenates them together; (2) the other group obtains node\nrepresentations by translating node attributes into network structure or vice\nversa. However, both groups have their drawbacks. The first group neglects the\ncorrelation between network structure and node attributes, while the second\ngroup assumes strong dependence between these two types of information. In this\npaper, we address attributed network embedding from a novel perspective, i.e.,\nlearning node context representation for each node via modeling its attributed\nlocal subgraph. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel attributed network\nauto-encoder framework, namely ANAE. For a target node, ANAE first aggregates\nthe attribute information from its attributed local subgraph, obtaining its\nlow-dimensional representation. Next, ANAE diffuses the representation of the\ntarget node to nodes in its local subgraph to reconstruct their attributes.\nSuch an encoder-decoder framework allows the learned representations to better\npreserve the context information manifested in both network structure and node\nattributes, thus having high capacity to learn good node representations for\nattributed network.

A popular theory for this\nphenomenon centers on the concept of \"filter bubbles\": by automatically\nrecommending content that a user is likely to agree with, social network\nalgorithms create echo chambers of similarly-minded users that would not have\narisen otherwise. However, while echo chambers have been observed in real-world\nnetworks, the evidence for filter bubbles is largely post-hoc.\n  In this work, we develop a mathematical framework to study the filter bubble\ntheory. We modify the classic Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model by\nintroducing another actor, the network administrator, who filters content for\nusers by making small changes to the edge weights of a social network (for\nexample, adjusting a news feed algorithm to change the level of interaction\nbetween users).\n  On real-world networks from Reddit and Twitter, we show that when the network\nadministrator is incentivized to reduce disagreement among users, even\nrelatively small edge changes can result in the formation of echo chambers in\nthe network and increase user polarization. We theoretically support this\nobserved sensitivity of social networks to outside intervention by analyzing\nsynthetic graphs generated from the stochastic block model. Finally, we show\nthat a slight modification to the incentives of the network administrator can\nmitigate the filter bubble effect while minimally affecting the administrator's\ntarget objective, user disagreement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 17:54:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-21"}

The high-energy radiation environment influences the\nhabitability, plays a crucial role for abiogenesis, and impacts planetary\natmospheres. LHS 1140b is a super-Earth-size planet orbiting in the HZ of LHS\n1140, an M4.5 dwarf at ~15 parsecs. We present the results of a Swift X-ray/UV\nobserving campaign. We characterize for the first time the X-ray/UV radiation\nenvironment of LHS 1140b. We measure the variability of the near ultraviolet\n(NUV) flux and estimate the far ultraviolet (FUV) flux with a correlation\nbetween FUV and NUV flux of a sample of low-mass stars in the GALEX archive. We\nhighlight the presence of a dominating X-ray source close to the J2000\ncoordinates of LHS 1140, characterize its spectrum, and derive an X-ray flux\nupper limit for LHS 1140.

LHS 1140 is in the\n25th percentile of least variable M4-M5 dwarfs of the GALEX sample. Analyzing\nthe UV flux experienced by the HZ planet LHS 1140b, we find that outside the\natmosphere it receives a NUV flux <2% with respect to that of the present-day\nEarth, while the FUV/NUV ratio is ~100-200 times higher. This represents a\nlower limit to the true FUV/NUV ratio since the GALEX FUV band does not include\nLyman-alpha, which dominates the FUV output of low-mass stars. This is a\nwarning for future searches for biomarkers, which must take into account this\nhigh ratio. The relatively low level and stability of UV flux experienced by\nLHS 1140b should be favorable for its present-day habitability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

One way to alleviate this problem is to\nmanage the radio resources in order to maximize either the average or the\nworst-case performance. However, joint consideration of both metrics is often\nneglected as they are competing in nature. In this article, a mechanism for\nradio resource management using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL) is\nproposed, which strikes the right trade-off between maximizing the average and\nthe $5^{th}$ percentile user throughput. Each transmitter in the network is\nequipped with a deep RL agent, receiving partial observations from the network\n(e.g., channel quality, interference level, etc.) and deciding whether to be\nactive or inactive at each scheduling interval for given radio resources, a\nprocess referred to as link scheduling. Based on the actions of all agents, the\nnetwork emits a reward to the agents, indicating how good their joint decisions\nwere. The proposed framework enables the agents to make decisions in a\ndistributed manner, and the reward is designed in such a way that the agents\nstrive to guarantee a minimum performance, leading to a fair resource\nallocation among all users across the network. Simulation results demonstrate\nthe superiority of our approach compared to decentralized baselines in terms of\naverage and $5^{th}$ percentile user throughput, while achieving performance\nclose to that of a centralized exhaustive search approach. Moreover, the\nproposed framework is robust to mismatches between training and testing\nscenarios. In particular, it is shown that an agent trained on a network with\nlow transmitter density maintains its performance and outperforms the baselines\nwhen deployed in a network with a higher transmitter density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 18:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-24"}

One of\nthe major challenges in using detection systems in practice is in dealing with\nan overwhelming number of alerts that are triggered by normal behavior (the\nso-called false positives), obscuring alerts resulting from actual malicious\nactivity. While numerous methods for reducing the scope of this issue have been\nproposed, ultimately one must still decide how to prioritize which alerts to\ninvestigate, and most existing prioritization methods are heuristic, for\nexample, based on suspiciousness or priority scores. We introduce a novel\napproach for computing a policy for prioritizing alerts using adversarial\nreinforcement learning. Our approach assumes that the attackers know the full\nstate of the detection system and dynamically choose an optimal attack as a\nfunction of this state, as well as of the alert prioritization policy. The\nfirst step of our approach is to capture the interaction between the defender\nand attacker in a game theoretic model. To tackle the computational complexity\nof solving this game to obtain a dynamic stochastic alert prioritization\npolicy, we propose an adversarial reinforcement learning framework. In this\nframework, we use neural reinforcement learning to compute best response\npolicies for both the defender and the adversary to an arbitrary stochastic\npolicy of the other. We then use these in a double-oracle framework to obtain\nan approximate equilibrium of the game, which in turn yields a robust\nstochastic policy for the defender. Extensive experiments using case studies in\nfraud and intrusion detection demonstrate that our approach is effective in\ncreating robust alert prioritization policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 18:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-24"}

Similar routing problems also\nexist in the design of complex hydraulic systems, pipe systems and logistic\nnetworks. Existing solutions typically consist of greedy algorithms and\nhard-coded heuristics. As such, existing approaches suffer from a lack of model\nflexibility and non-optimum solutions. As an alternative approach, this work\npresents a deep reinforcement learning method for solving the global routing\nproblem in a simulated environment. At the heart of the proposed method is deep\nreinforcement learning that enables an agent to produce an optimal policy for\nrouting based on the variety of problems it is presented with leveraging the\nconjoint optimization mechanism of deep reinforcement learning. Conjoint\noptimization mechanism is explained and demonstrated in details; the best\nnetwork structure and the parameters of the learned model are explored. Based\non the fine-tuned model, routing solutions and rewards are presented and\nanalyzed. The results indicate that the approach can outperform the benchmark\nmethod of a sequential A* method, suggesting a promising potential for deep\nreinforcement learning for global routing and other routing or path planning\nproblems in general.

Conventionally, Shannon's random coding arguments -- using randomly\ngenerated unstructured codebooks whose blocklength is taken to be\nasymptotically large -- are used to derive achievability results. However, it\nwas recently observed that in various multi-terminal communications scenarios,\nusing random codes with constant finite blocklength may lead to improved\nachievable regions compared to the conventional approach. In other words, in\nsome network communication scenarios, there is a finite optimal value in the\nblocklength of the randomly generated code used for distributed processing of\ninformation sources. Motivated by this, a coding scheme is proposed which\nconsists of two codebook layers: i) the primary codebook which has constant\nfinite blocklength, and ii) the secondary codebook whose blocklength is taken\nto be asymptotically large.

While this shrinkage improves performance and density, it also reduces\ntrust: the price to build leading-edge fabrication facilities has skyrocketed,\nforcing even nation states to outsource the fabrication of high-performance\nICs. Outsourcing fabrication presents a security threat because the black-box\nnature of a fabricated IC makes comprehensive inspection infeasible. Since\nprior work shows the feasibility of fabrication-time attackers' evasion of\nexisting post-fabrication defenses, IC designers must be able to protect their\nphysical designs before handing them off to an untrusted foundry. To this end,\nrecent work suggests methods to harden IC layouts against attack.\nUnfortunately, no tool exists to assess the effectiveness of the proposed\ndefenses---meaning gaps may exist.\n  This paper presents an extensible IC layout security analysis tool called IC\nAttack Surface (ICAS) that quantifies defensive coverage. For researchers, ICAS\nidentifies gaps for future defenses to target, and enables the quantitative\ncomparison of existing and future defenses. For practitioners, ICAS enables the\nexploration of the impact of design decisions on an IC's resilience to\nfabrication-time attack. ICAS takes a set of metrics that encode the challenge\nof inserting a hardware Trojan into an IC layout, a set of attacks that the\ndefender cares about, and a completed IC layout and reports the number of ways\nan attacker can add each attack to the design. While the ideal score is zero,\npractically, our experience is that lower scores correlate with increased\nattacker effort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 20:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-24"}

While this\nadvancement significantly improves computing capability, fabrication costs have\nskyrocketed. As a result, most IC designers must now outsource fabrication.\nOutsourcing, however, presents a security threat: comprehensive\npost-fabrication inspection is infeasible given the size of modern ICs, so it\nis nearly impossible to know if the foundry has altered the original design\nduring fabrication (i.e., inserted a hardware Trojan). Defending against a\nfoundry-side adversary is challenging because---even with as few as two\ngates---hardware Trojans can completely undermine software security.\nResearchers have attempted to both detect and prevent foundry-side attacks, but\nall existing defenses are ineffective against Trojans with footprints of a few\ngates or less.\n  We present Targeted Tamper-Evident Routing (T-TER), a preventive layout-level\ndefense against untrusted foundries, capable of thwarting the insertion of even\nthe stealthiest hardware Trojans. T-TER is directed and routing-centric: it\nprevents foundry-side attackers from routing Trojan wires to, or directly\nadjacent to, security-critical wires by shielding them with guard wires. Unlike\nshield wires commonly deployed for cross-talk reduction, T-TER guard wires pose\nan additional technical challenge: they must be tamper-evident in both the\ndigital (deletion attacks) and analog (move and jog attacks) domains. We\naddress this challenge by developing a class of designed-in guard wires, that\nare added to the design specifically to protect security-critical wires.\nT-TER's guard wires incur minimal overhead, scale with design complexity, and\nprovide tamper-evidence against attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 20:42:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 18:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-29"}

The demand strictly exceeds the carrier's capacity; even though,\nthe average demand can be still fulfilled throughout the year. In this sense,\nwe let the carrier has three options to respond to the demand: Dispersing the\ndemand with a penalty, leasing additional asset(s) temporarily, and outsourcing\nsome capacity. We propose a modeling and solution approach that jointly\nincorporates asset management and sizing, outsourcing (3PLs), and\nearliness/tardiness penalties.

Since the\nbalance between predictive mean and the predictive variance is the key\ndeterminant to the success of Bayesian optimization, the current sparse\nspectrum methods are less suitable for it. We derive a new regularized marginal\nlikelihood for finding the optimal frequencies to fix this over-confidence\nissue, particularly for Bayesian optimization.

Generally, it is essential to measure the importance of\neach individual view, due to some noises, or inherent capacities in\ndescription. Many previous works model the view importance as weight, which is\nsimple but effective empirically. In this paper, instead of following the\ntraditional thoughts, we propose a new weight learning paradigm in context of\nmulti-view clustering in virtue of the idea of re-weighted approach, and we\ntheoretically analyze its working mechanism. Meanwhile, as a carefully achieved\nexample, all of the views are connected by exploring a unified Laplacian rank\nconstrained graph, which will be a representative method to compare with other\nweight learning approaches in experiments. Furthermore, the proposed weight\nlearning strategy is much suitable for multi-view data, and it can be naturally\nintegrated with many existing clustering learners. According to the numerical\nexperiments, the proposed intrinsic weight learning approach is proved\neffective and practical to use in multi-view clustering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 01:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-24"}

Current\nresearch efforts on emergency response assessments focus on case studies, where\nspecific periods (e.g., super storm Sandy) of emergency response times are\nanalyzed. Simulation based studies that aim to evaluate response times in\nrelation to various constraints/fleet sizes also exist. However, they do not\nanalyze how specific changes (e.g., new and ongoing construction projects) in\nurban settings impact emergency response times of first responders. This paper\naims to fill the gap and proposes a novel approach to predict the expected\nemergency response time for a given location using the fabric of zones\nregarding construction activities. This approach relies on historical records\nof emergency response and construction permits issued by city agencies. The\napproach first defines the signature of a zone (by zip codes) for construction\nactivities based on the distribution of historical construction work types\npermitted in that zone over time. Then, zones that share similar signatures are\nclustered to find if there exists a relationship between construction\nsignatures and emergency response times. Next, supervised learning algorithms\nare deployed to predict the average emergency response times for each cluster.\nThe approach was tested using New York City's construction permit and emergency\nresponse records, and can be easily replicated for other cities with similar\npublic datasets. This study serves as the first step towards quantitatively\nunderstanding construction projects' impact on a quality of life (QoL)\nindicator (specifically emergency response times) in urban settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 01:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-24"}

Although\nobservational properties are largely affected by bound-bound opacities of\nr-process elements, available atomic data have been limited. In this paper, we\nstudy element-to-element variation of the opacities in the ejecta of neutron\nstar mergers by performing systematic atomic structure calculations of\nr-process elements for the first time. We show that the distributions of energy\nlevels tend to be higher as electron occupation increases for each electron\nshell due to the larger energy spacing caused by larger effects of spin-orbit\nand electron-electron interactions. As a result, elements with a fewer number\nof electrons in the outermost shells tend to give larger contributions to the\nbound-bound opacities. This implies that Fe is not representative for the\nopacities of light r-process elements. The average opacities for the mixture of\nr-process elements are found to be kappa ~ 20-30 cm^2 g^{-1} for the electron\nfraction of Ye < 0.20, kappa ~ 3-5 cm^2 g^{-1} for Ye = 0.25-0.35, and kappa ~\n1 cm^2 g^{-1} for Ye = 0.40 at T = 5,000-10,000 K, and they steeply decrease at\nlower temperature.

This basic phenomenon is called the Kondo\neffect. Contrary to electric charge screening, the spin screening cloud occurs\nquantum coherently, forming spin-singlet entanglement with the impurity.\nAlthough the spins interact locally around the impurity, the cloud can spread\nout over micrometers. The Kondo cloud has never been detected to date, and its\nexistence, a fundamental aspect of the Kondo effect, remains as a long-standing\ncontroversial issue. Here we present experimental evidence of a Kondo cloud\nextending over a length of micrometers comparable to the theoretical length\n$\\xi_\\mathrm{K}$. In our device, a Kondo impurity is formed in a quantum dot\n(QD), one-sided coupling to a quasi-one dimensional\nchannel~\\cite{Theory_Proposal_HS} that houses a Fabry-Perot (FP) interferometer\nof various gate-defined lengths $L > 1 \\, \\mu$m. When we sweep a voltage on the\ninterferometer end gate separated from the QD by the length $L$ to induce FP\noscillations in conductance, we observe oscillations in measured Kondo\ntemperature $T_\\mathrm{K}$, a sign of the cloud at distance $L$. For $L\n\\lesssim \\xi_\\mathrm{K}$ the $T_\\mathrm{K}$ oscillation amplitude becomes\nlarger for the smaller $L$, obeying a scaling function of a single parameter\n$L/ \\xi_\\mathrm{K}$, while for $L>\\xi_\\mathrm{K}$ the oscillation is much\nweaker. The result reveals that $\\xi_\\mathrm{K}$ is the only length parameter\nassociated with the Kondo effect, and that the cloud lies mostly inside the\nlength $\\xi_\\mathrm{K}$ which reaches microns. Our experimental method of using\nelectron interferometers offers a way of detecting the spatial distribution of\nexotic non-Fermi liquids formed by multiple magnetic impurities or multiple\nscreening channels and solving long-standing issues of spin-correlated systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 02:09:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-02"}

In robotics however, IRL often struggles\nbecause it is difficult to get high-quality demonstrations; conversely,\npreference-based learning is very inefficient since it attempts to learn a\ncontinuous, high-dimensional function from binary feedback. We propose a new\nframework for reward learning, DemPref, that uses both demonstrations and\npreference queries to learn a reward function. Specifically, we (1) use the\ndemonstrations to learn a coarse prior over the space of reward functions, to\nreduce the effective size of the space from which queries are generated; and\n(2) use the demonstrations to ground the (active) query generation process, to\nimprove the quality of the generated queries.

In numerical\nexperiments, we find that DemPref is significantly more efficient than a\nstandard active preference-based learning method.

However, the\nnumber of non-relation entity pairs in context (negative instances) usually far\nexceeds the others (positive instances), which negatively affects a model's\nperformance. To mitigate this problem, we propose a multi-task architecture\nwhich jointly trains a model to perform relation identification with\ncross-entropy loss and relation classification with ranking loss. Meanwhile, we\nobserve that a sentence may have multiple entities and relation mentions, and\nthe patterns in which the entities appear in a sentence may contain useful\nsemantic information that can be utilized to distinguish between positive and\nnegative instances. Thus we further incorporate the embeddings of\ncharacter-wise/word-wise BIO tag from the named entity recognition task into\ncharacter/word embeddings to enrich the input representation.

Motivated by the recent discovery of fast-moving objects that\noccupy unusual locations on the HR diagram, we explore the impact of the\nthermonuclear supernovae on the donors in this specific double detonation\nscenario. We use MESA to model the binary up to the moment of detonation, then\n3D Athena++ to model the hydrodynamic interaction of the supernova ejecta with\nthe donor star, calculating the amount of mass that is stripped and the entropy\ndeposited in the deep stellar interior by the strong shock that traverses it.\nWe show that these donor remnants are ejected with velocities primarily set by\ntheir orbital speeds: $700-900\\ \\rm km\\ s^{-1}$.

We propose an approach for mitigating this problem by\ndecreasing the strength of the side channels as measured by entropy-based\nobjectives, such as min-guess entropy. Our goal is to minimize the information\nleaks while guaranteeing a user-specified maximal acceptable performance\noverhead. We dub the decision version of this problem Shannon mitigation, and\nconsider two variants, deterministic and stochastic. First, we show the\ndeterministic variant is NP-hard. However, we give a polynomial algorithm that\nfinds an optimal solution from a restricted set. Second, for the stochastic\nvariant, we develop an algorithm that uses optimization techniques specific to\nthe entropy-based objective used. For instance, for min-guess entropy, we used\nmixed integer-linear programming. We apply the algorithm to a threat model\nwhere the attacker gets to make functional observations, that is, where she\nobserves the running time of the program for the same secret value combined\nwith different public input values. Existing mitigation approaches do not give\nconfidentiality or performance guarantees for this threat model. We evaluate\nour tool SCHMIT on a number of micro-benchmarks and real-world applications\nwith different entropy-based objectives. In contrast to the existing mitigation\napproaches, we show that in the functional-observation threat model, SCHMIT is\nscalable and able to maximize confidentiality under the performance overhead\nbound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 05:50:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-24"}

Such mechanosensitive responses to ECM mechanics are key to\nunderstanding the regulation of biological tissues by mechanical cues, as it\noccurs, e.g., during angiogenesis and the alignment of cells in muscles and\ntendons. Although it is well established that the mechanical cell-ECM\ninteractions are mediated by focal adhesions, the mechanosensitive molecular\ncomplexes linking the cytoskeleton to the substrate, it is poorly understood\nhow the stiffness-dependent kinetics of the focal adhesions eventually produce\nthe observed interdependence of substrate stiffness and cell shape and cell\nbehavior. Here we show that the mechanosensitive behavior of single-focal\nadhesions, cell contractility and substrate adhesivity together suffice to\nexplain the observed stiffness-dependent behavior of cells. We introduce a\nmultiscale computational model that is based upon the following assumptions:\n(1) cells apply forces onto the substrate through FAs; (2) the FAs grow and\nstabilize due to these forces; (3) within a given time-interval, the force that\nthe FAs experience is lower on soft substrates than on stiffer substrates due\nto the time it takes to reach mechanical equilibrium; and (4) smaller FAs are\npulled from the substrate more easily than larger FAs. Our model combines the\ncellular Potts model for the cells with a finite-element model for the\nsubstrate, and describes each FA using differential equations. Together these\nassumptions provide a unifying model for cell spreading, cell elongation and\ndurotaxis in response to substrate mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 06:09:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-24"}

For the\nfirst time, the non-zero electron $v_2$ from beauty hadron decays ($v_2^{\\rm\nb\\rightarrow e}$) at $p_{\\rm T}$ $>$ 3.0 GeV/$c$ is observed and shows smaller\nelliptic flow compared with that from charmed hadron decays at $p_{\\rm T}$ $<$\n4.0 GeV/$c$. At 2.5 GeV/$c$ $<$ $p_{\\rm T}$ $<$ 4.5 GeV/$c$, $v_2^{\\rm\nb\\rightarrow e}$ is smaller than a number-of-constituent-quark (NCQ) scaling\nhypothesis. This suggests that beauty quark is unlikely thermalized and too\nheavy to be moved in a partonic collectivity in heavy-ion collisions at the\nRHIC energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 06:35:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2019 08:41:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 12:19:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 05:23:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-14"}

Furthermore, we extend\nthe DAR model to deal with continuous spectral features, and a prenet module\nwith self-attention layers is introduced to process historical frames.\nExperiments on a Chinese singing voice corpus demonstrate that our method using\nDARs can produce F0 contours with vibratos effectively, and can achieve better\nobjective and subjective performance than the conventional method using\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 06:40:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-24"}

Such a description is valid only if the\nspatial volume of the region considered is so large that its size and shape\nmoduli behave classically. However, if we trace an inflating universe back to\nearly times, the volume of any comoving region of interest -- for example the\npresent Hubble volume -- becomes exponentially small. Hence, quantum\nfluctuations in the trajectory of the background cannot be neglected at early\ntimes. In this paper, we develop a path integral description of a flat,\ninflating patch (approximated as de Sitter spacetime), treating both the\nbackground scale factor and the gravitational wave perturbations quantum\nmechanically. We find this description fails at small values of the initial\nscale factor, because \\emph{two} background saddle point solutions contribute\nto the path integral. This leads to a breakdown of QFT in curved spacetime,\ncausing the fluctuations to be unstable and out of control. We show the problem\nmay be alleviated by a careful choice of quantum initial conditions, for the\nbackground and the fluctuations, provided that the volume of the initial,\ninflating patch is larger than $\\gg H^{-1}$ in Planck units with $H$ the Hubble\nconstant at the start of inflation. The price of the remedy is high: not only\nthe inflating background, but also the stable, Bunch-Davies fluctuations must\nbe input by hand.

For supervised approaches, as the number of concepts\ngrows, so does the number of required training examples. Philosophers,\npsychologists, and computer scientists, have long recognized that children can\nlearn to label objects without being explicitly taught. In a series of\ncomputational experiments, we highlight how information in the environment can\nbe used to build and align conceptual systems. Unlike supervised learning, the\nlearning problem becomes easier the more concepts and systems there are to\nmaster. The key insight is that each concept has a unique signature within one\nconceptual system (e.g., images) that is recapitulated in other systems (e.g.,\ntext or audio). As predicted, children's early concepts form readily aligned\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 08:54:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 09:20:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 17:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-20"}

However, for\nmusculoskeletal robot systems, motor redundancy can be of useful information to\nexplain muscle activation patterns, thus the term motor abundance. In this\nwork, we introduce some simple heuristics to empirically define the unknown\ngoal space, and learn the inverse kinematics of a 10 DoF musculoskeletal robot\narm using directed goal babbling. We then further propose local online motor\nbabbling using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which\nbootstraps on the collected samples in goal babbling for initialization, such\nthat motor abundance can be queried for any static goal within the defined goal\nspace.

In this\npaper, we consider the problem of network-aware popularity prediction,\nleveraging both early adopters and social networks for popularity prediction.\nWe propose to capture the cascading effect explicitly, modeling the activation\nstate of a target user given the activation state and influence of his/her\nneighbors. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel method, namely CoupledGNN,\nwhich uses two coupled graph neural networks to capture the interplay between\nnode activation states and the spread of influence. By stacking graph neural\nnetwork layers, our proposed method naturally captures the cascading effect\nalong the network in a successive manner.

A recent line of work has\nconsidered fairness questions for resource allocation when the demands for the\nresource are distributed across multiple groups and drawn from probability\ndistributions. In such cases, a natural fairness requirement is that\nindividuals from different groups should have (approximately) equal\nprobabilities of receiving the resource. A largely open question in this area\nhas been to bound the gap between the maximum possible utilization of the\nresource and the maximum possible utilization subject to this fairness\ncondition.\n  Here, we obtain some of the first provable upper bounds on this gap. We\nobtain an upper bound for arbitrary distributions, as well as much stronger\nupper bounds for specific families of distributions that are typically used to\nmodel levels of demand.

The process consists of several\nrandom events among which the reinitiation of transcription by RNAP is an\nimportant one.

Standard coherence distillation and dilution problems have\nbeen thoroughly studied. In this paper, we introduce and study the problem of\none-shot coherence distillation with catalysts. In order to distill more\ncoherence from a state of interest, a catalytic system can be involved and a\njointly free operation is applied to both systems. The joint output state\nshould be a maximally coherent state in tensor product with the unchanged\ncatalysts, with some allowable fidelity error. We consider several different\ndefinitions of this problem. Firstly, with a small fidelity error in both\nsystems, we show that, even via the smallest free operation class (PIO), the\ndistillable coherence of any state with no restriction on the catalysts is\ninfinite, which is a \"coherence embezzling phenomenon\". We then define and\ncalculate a lower bound for the distillable coherence when the dimension of\ncatalysts is restricted. Finally, in consideration of physical relevance, we\ndefine the \"perfect catalysts\" scenario where the catalysts are required to be\npure and precisely unchanged. Interestingly, we show that in this setting\ncatalysts basically provide no advantages in pure state distillation via IO and\nSIO under certain smoothing restriction. Our work enhances the understanding of\ncatalytic effect in quantum resource theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 11:10:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

Nevertheless, existing techniques to facilitate\nVMI management overlook VMI semantics (i.e at the level of base image and\nsoftware packages) with either restricted possibility to identify and extract\nreusable functionalities or with higher VMI publish and retrieval overheads. In\nthis paper, we design, implement and evaluate Expelliarmus, a novel VMI\nmanagement system that helps to minimize storage, publish and retrieval\noverheads.

As a lower bound, we\nprove that virtually overtwisted structures on lens spaces never bound Stein\nrational homology balls.

However,\nit is challenging for a reinforcement model to learn a policy for each task\nsequentially due to catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, the model would\nforget knowledge it learned in the past when trained on a new task. We consider\nthis challenge from two perspectives: i) acquiring task-specific skills is\ndifficult since task information and rewards are not highly related; ii)\nlearning knowledge from previous experience is difficult in continuous control\ndomains. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end framework namely Continual\nDiversity Adversarial Network (CDAN). We first develop an unsupervised\ndiversity exploration method to learn task-specific skills using an\nunsupervised objective. Then, we propose an adversarial self-correction\nmechanism to learn knowledge by exploiting past experience. The two learning\nprocedures are presumably reciprocal. To evaluate the proposed method, we\npropose a new continuous reinforcement learning environment named Continual Ant\nMaze (CAM) and a new metric termed Normalized Shorten Distance (NSD). The\nexperimental results confirm the effectiveness of diversity exploration and\nself-correction. It is worthwhile noting that our final result outperforms\nbaseline by 18.35% in terms of NSD, and 0.61 according to the average reward.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 15:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-24"}

However, existing works on IRS mainly consider frequency-flat\nchannels and assume perfect knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the\ntransmitter. Motivated by this, in this paper we study an IRS-enhanced\northogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system under\nfrequency-selective channels and propose a practical transmission protocol with\nchannel estimation. First, to reduce the overhead in channel training and\nestimation and to exploit the channel spatial correlation, we propose a novel\nIRS elements grouping method, where each group consists of a set of adjacent\nIRS elements that share a common reflection coefficient. Based on this grouping\nmethod, we propose a practical transmission protocol where only the combined\nchannel of each group needs to be estimated, thus substantially reducing the\ntraining overhead. Next, with any given grouping and estimated CSI, we\nformulate the problem to maximize the achievable rate by jointly optimizing the\ntransmit power allocation and the IRS passive array reflection coefficients.\nAlthough the formulated problem is non-convex and thus difficult to solve, we\npropose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution for\nit, by alternately optimizing the power allocation and the passive array\ncoefficients in an iterative manner, along with a customized method for the\ninitialization. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly\nimproves the OFDM link rate performance as compared to the case without using\nIRS. Moreover, it is shown that there exists an optimal size for IRS elements\ngrouping which achieves the maximum achievable rate due to the trade-off\nbetween the training overhead and IRS passive beamforming flexibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 09:25:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 07:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-25"}

Interfaces tracking models like phase-field\nmodeling (PFM) are promising candidates to capture the microstructures\ndynamics. Contact PFM (CPFM) enables to include catalyzing/inhibiting (CI)\neffects, accelerating/delaying equilibrium, such as temperature or the presence\nof certain constituents. To emphasize the influence of geometry and CI effects,\nwe study numerically the chemo-mechanical response of digitalized geomaterials\nat the grain scale. An application to pressure solution creep (PSC) shows the\nimportance of the MG and how the influence of temperature and clay can be taken\ninto account without explicit modeling. As already inferred in previous works\non PSC, the lack of MG considerations could be the reason why a unique\ndescription of PSC is missing. A simple reason could be that PSC is directly\ndependent on the strain concentration, which is directly dependent on the MG.\nThis is our motivation here to investigate and suggest the influence of the MG\non a degradation process like PSC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 22:31:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

In many applications, contextual constraints need to be applied to\nrefine recommendations, e.g. when a user specifies a price range or product\ncategory filter. The conventional approach, for both context-aware and standard\nmodels, is to retrieve items and apply the constraints as independent\noperations. The order in which these two steps are executed can induce\nsignificant problems. For example, applying constraints a posteriori can result\nin incomplete recommendations or low-quality results for the tail of the\ndistribution (i.e., less popular items). As a result, the additional\ninformation that the constraint brings about user intent may not be accurately\ncaptured.\n  In this paper we propose integrating the information provided by the\ncontextual constraint into the similarity computation, by merging constraint\napplication and retrieval into one operation in the embedding space. This\ntechnique allows us to generate high-quality recommendations for the specified\nconstraint. Our approach learns constraints representations jointly with the\nuser and item embeddings. We incorporate our methods into a matrix\nfactorization model, and perform an experimental evaluation on one internal and\ntwo real-world datasets. Our results show significant improvements in\npredictive performance compared to context-aware and standard models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 07:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-04"}
