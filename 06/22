In this work, we propose novel lower and\nupper bounds for the fidelity $F(\\rho,\\sigma)$ based on the \"truncated\nfidelity\" $F(\\rho_m, \\sigma)$, which is evaluated for a state $\\rho_m$ obtained\nby projecting $\\rho$ onto its $m$-largest eigenvalues. Our bounds can be\nrefined, i.e., they tighten monotonically with $m$. To compute our bounds, we\nintroduce a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, called Variational Quantum\nFidelity Estimation, that involves three steps: (1) variationally diagonalize\n$\\rho$, (2) compute matrix elements of $\\sigma$ in the eigenbasis of $\\rho$,\nand (3) combine these matrix elements to compute our bounds. Our algorithm is\naimed at the case where $\\sigma$ is arbitrary and $\\rho$ is low rank, which we\ncall low-rank fidelity estimation, and we prove that a classical algorithm\ncannot efficiently solve this problem. Finally, we demonstrate that our bounds\ncan detect quantum phase transitions and are often tighter than previously\nknown computable bounds for realistic situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 17:35:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 21:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-27"}

However, due to our inability\nto track the time evolution of individual molecular clouds, quantifying the\nexact role of feedback on their star formation history is an observationally\nchallenging task. In the present study, we take advantage of the unique\nproperties of the G316.75-00.00 high-mass star-forming ridge to determine how\nfeedback from O-stars impacts the dynamical stability of filaments. G316.75 is\na 13.6pc long ridge containing 18,900Msun of H2 gas which is half IR dark, half\nIR bright. The IR bright half has already formed 4 O-type stars over the past\n2Myr, while the IR dark half is still quiescent. Therefore, by assuming the gas\nproperties of the dark part represents an earlier evolutionary stage of the\nbright part, we can quantify how feedback impacts these properties by\ncontrasting them. We use archive Herschel and molecular line data, tracing both\ndense (NH3 and N2H+) and more diffuse (13CO) gas, to measure the ratio of\nkinetic to gravitational energy per-unit-length, virial-ratio-per-line, across\nthe ridge for a range of gas volume densities. We show that despite the\npresence of 4 embedded O-stars, feedback cannot unbind the ridge's mass except\nfor some small gas pockets near the O-stars. In fact, the virial-ratio-per-line\nis almost indistinguishable for both parts of the ridge. These results are at\nodds with most simulations where O-star-forming clouds are dispersed by\nfeedback within a few cloud free-fall time. We conclude that the discrepancy\nbetween such simulations and our observations originates from different cloud\nmorphologies and average densities when the first O-star forms. These results\nhave important implications regarding, for instance, how feedback is\nimplemented within cosmological and galactic-scale simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

This restructuring of the power system has a considerable effect on\nthe transient response of the system resulting in inter-area oscillations, less\nsynchronized coupling and power swings. Furthermore, the concept of being\ndistributed itself and generating electricity from multiple locations in the\npower system makes the transient impact of DERs even worse by raising issues\nsuch as reverse power flows. This paper studies some impacts of the changing\nnature of power system which are limiting the large scale integration of DERs.\nIn addition, a solution to increase the inertial response of the system is\naddressed by adding virtual inertia to the inverter based DERs in the power\nsystem.

The injected synchronized active\npower to the system will prevent the protection relays from tripping by\nimproving the rate of change of frequency.

Coupling this with\nthe fact that an analyst can never know which approach is best for their\nparticular data, we propose a synthetic estimator that averages over a set of\ncandidate estimators. Averaging is widely used in statistics for problems such\nas prediction, where there are many possible models, and averaging can improve\nperformance and increase robustness to using incorrect models. We show that\nthese ideas carry over into the estimation of causal effects in\nhigh-dimensional scenarios. We show theoretically that averaging provides\nrobustness against choosing a bad model, and show empirically via simulation\nthat the averaging estimator performs quite well, and in most cases nearly as\nwell as the best among all possible candidate estimators. Finally, we\nillustrate these ideas in an environmental wide association study and see that\naveraging provides the largest benefit in the more difficult scenarios that\nhave large numbers of confounders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 19:45:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 03:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

We consider the case where the\nseller has costs to produce the items, and these costs are private information\nto the seller. How can the seller design a mechanism to maximize her profit?\nTwo well-studied problems, revenue maximization in multi-item auctions and\nsignaling in ad auctions, are special cases of our problem. We show that there\nexists a simple mechanism whose profit is at least $\\frac{1}{44}$ of the\noptimal profit for multiple buyers with matroid-rank valuation functions. When\nthere is a single buyer, the approximation factor is $11$ for general\nconstraint-additive valuations and $6$ for additive valuations. Our result\nholds even when the seller's costs are correlated across items.\n  We introduce a new class of mechanisms called permit-selling mechanisms. For\nsingle buyer case these mechanisms are quite simple: there are two stages. For\neach item $j$, we create a separate permit that allows the buyer to purchase\nthe item in the second stage. In the first stage, we sell the permits without\nrevealing any information about the costs. In the second stage, the seller\nreveals all the costs, and the buyer can buy item $j$ by paying the item price\nif the buyer has purchased the permit for item $j$ in the first stage. We show\nthat either selling the permits separately or as a grand bundle suffices to\nachieve the constant factor approximation to the optimal profit (6 for\nadditive, and 11 for constrained additive). For multiple buyers, we sell the\npermits sequentially and obtain the constant factor approximation. Our proof is\nenabled by constructing a benchmark for the optimal profit by combining a novel\ndual solution with the existing ex-ante relaxation technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 19:47:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 22:26:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20"}

The crucial component of any rate calculation is the\ndetectability and space-time volume sensitivity of a survey to a particular\ntransient type as a function of many intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. Fully\nsampling that multi-dimensional parameter space is challenging. Instead, we\npresent a scheme to assess the detectability of transients using supervised\nmachine learning.

Being\nrobust to a desired family of adversarial attacks is then equivalent to being\ninvariant to a family of transformations. Learning invariant representations\nthen naturally emerges as an important goal to achieve which we explore in this\npaper within specific application contexts. Specifically, we propose a\ncyclically-trained adversarial network to learn a mapping from image space to\nlatent representation space and back such that the latent representation is\ninvariant to a specified factor of variation (e.g., identity). The learned\nmapping assures that the synthesized image is not only realistic, but has the\nsame values for unspecified factors (e.g., pose and illumination) as the\noriginal image and a desired value of the specified factor. Unlike disentangled\nrepresentation learning, which requires two latent spaces, one for specified\nand another for unspecified factors, invariant representation learning needs\nonly one such space. We encourage invariance to a specified factor by applying\nadversarial training using a variational autoencoder in the image space as\nopposed to the latent space. We strengthen this invariance by introducing a\ncyclic training process (forward and backward cycle). We also propose a new\nmethod to evaluate conditional generative networks. It compares how well\ndifferent factors of variation can be predicted from the synthesized, as\nopposed to real, images. In quantitative terms, our approach attains\nstate-of-the-art performance in experiments spanning three datasets with\nfactors such as identity, pose, illumination or style.

However, many key aspects of a desired behavior are more\nnaturally expressed as constraints. For instance, the designer may want to\nlimit the use of unsafe actions, increase the diversity of trajectories to\nenable exploration, or approximate expert trajectories when rewards are sparse.\nIn this paper, we propose an algorithmic scheme that can handle a wide class of\nconstraints in RL tasks: specifically, any constraints that require expected\nvalues of some vector measurements (such as the use of an action) to lie in a\nconvex set. This captures previously studied constraints (such as safety and\nproximity to an expert), but also enables new classes of constraints (such as\ndiversity).

In this work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving data\nGenerative model based on the PATE framework (G-PATE), aiming to train a\nscalable differentially private data generator that preserves high generated\ndata utility. Our approach leverages generative adversarial nets to generate\ndata, combined with private aggregation among different discriminators to\nensure strong privacy guarantees. Compared to existing approaches, G-PATE\nsignificantly improves the use of privacy budgets. In particular, we train a\nstudent data generator with an ensemble of teacher discriminators and propose a\nnovel private gradient aggregation mechanism to ensure differential privacy on\nall information that flows from teacher discriminators to the student\ngenerator. In addition, with random projection and gradient discretization, the\nproposed gradient aggregation mechanism is able to effectively deal with\nhigh-dimensional gradient vectors. Theoretically, we prove that G-PATE ensures\ndifferential privacy for the data generator. Empirically, we demonstrate the\nsuperiority of G-PATE over prior work through extensive experiments.

The\ngravitational wave memory obtained this way depends linearly and locally on the\nretarded metric perturbation caused by the gravitational wave, and, remarkably,\nit takes on exactly the same formula (1) as in the flat case. To determine the\nmemory, in addition to the standard tail contribution to the gravitational\nradiation, one need to take into account of the contribution from the reflected\ngravitational wave off the AdS boundary. For general curved spacetime, our\nanalysis suggests that the use of a certain coordinate system adapted to the\nlocal geodesic (e.g. the Fermi normal coordinates system in the AdS case) would\nallow one to dissect the geodesic deviation of test particles and extract the\nrelevant contribution to define the memory due to gravitational radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 2019 01:20:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2019 14:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

Deforestation in high-income nations can\ncontribute substantially to global forest loss, despite the presence of strong\ninstitutions and high policy capacity. In Queensland, Australia, over 5 million\nhectares of native forest has been lost since 1988. Successive regulatory\npolicies have aimed to reduce deforestation in Queensland, though debate exists\nover their effect given the influence of other drivers of forest loss. Using a\nhierarchical Bayesian statistical framework, we combine satellite imagery of\nforest loss with macroeconomic, land tenure, biophysical and climatic variables\nto collectively model deforestation for 50 local government areas (LGAs) across\nQueensland. We apply the spatially explicit bent-cable regression model to\ndetect trend change that may signal a regulatory policy effect. We find that\nannual % growth in GDP was the only clear driver of LGA-specific deforestation\nafter adjusting for other covariate effects. Our model shows strong evidence of\nspatial contagion in deforestation across Queensland, and this effect is\ninfluenced by the dominant land tenure type within each LGA. We find our model\nexhibits a \"bend\" mostly between 2000 and 2007, consistent with expectations,\nbut the signal is not particularly strong due extreme variation in\ndeforestation trends between and within LGAs. Our results demonstrate that the\nbent-cable model is a promising technique for detecting system changes in\nresponse to policy interventions, but future work should be conducted at a\nnational scale to provide more data points, and incorporate more LGA-specific\ndata to improve model goodness-of-fit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 2019 02:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

We treat halo merger tree\nconstruction as a matrix generation problem, and propose a Generative\nAdversarial Network that learns to generate realistic halo merger trees. We\nevaluate our proposal on merger trees from the EAGLE simulation suite, and show\nthe quality of the generated trees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 2019 03:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

The proposed link prediction\nmethods compute a similarity measure between unconnected node pairs based on\nthe observed structure of the network.

The layers of\nreal-world multiplex networks do not have the same organization yet are not of\ntotally different organizations. So, it should be determined that how similar\nare the layers of a multiplex network. On the other hand, it is needed to be\nknown that how similar layers can contribute in link prediction task on a\ntarget layer with missing links. Eigenvectors are known to well reflect the\nstructural features of networks. Therefore, two layers of a multiplex network\nare similar w.r.t. structural features if they share similar eigenvectors.\nExperiments show that layers of real-world multiplex networks are similar\nw.r.t. structural features and the value of similarity is far beyond their\nrandomized counterparts. Furthermore, it is shown that missing links are highly\npredictable if their addition or removal do not significantly change the\nnetwork structural features. Otherwise, if the change is significant a similar\ncopy of structural features may come to help.

We further develop a novel\ndifference-of-convex (DC) programming algorithm to solve the resulting\nnon-convex quadratic programs efficiently by lifting the quadratic programs\ninto rank-one constrained matrix optimization problems, followed by\nrepresenting the non-convex rank function as a DC function. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the performance gains of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 2019 11:17:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 13:24:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2019 07:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

A Bayesian optimizer iteratively\nqueries the function values on its carefully selected points. Subsequently, it\nmakes a sensible recommendation about where the optimum locates based on its\naccumulated knowledge. This procedure usually demands a long execution time. In\npractice, however, there often exists a computational budget or an evaluation\nlimitation allocated to an optimizer, due to the resource scarcity. This\nconstraint demands an optimizer to be aware of its remaining budget and able to\nspend it wisely, in order to return as better a point as possible. In this\npaper, we propose a Bayesian optimization approach in this evaluation-limited\nscenario. Our approach is based on constraining searching directions so as to\ndedicate the model capability to the most promising area.

Methods: We surveyed a\nsample of 25 carbon-rich AGB stars in the $\\lambda$ 2 mm band, using the IRAM\n30 m telescope. We performed excitation and radiative transfer calculations\nbased on the LVG method to model the observed lines of the molecules and to\nderive their fractional abundances in the observed CSEs. Results: We detected\nCS in all 25 CSEs, SiO in 24 of them, and SiS in 17 sources. We found that CS\nand SiS have similar abundances in carbon star envelopes, while SiO is present\nwith a lower abundance. We also found a strong correlation in which the denser\nthe envelope, the less abundant are CS and SiO. The trend is however only\ntentatively seen for SiS in the range of high mass loss rates. Furthermore, we\nfound a relation in which the integrated flux of the MgS dust feature at 30 um\nincreases as the fractional abundance of CS decreases. Conclusions: The decline\nin the fractional abundance of CS with increasing density could be due to\ngas-phase chemistry in the inner envelope or to adsorption onto dust grains.\nThe latter possibility is favored by a correlation between the CS fractional\nabundance and the 30 um feature, which suggests that CS is efficiently\nincorporated onto MgS dust around C-rich AGB stars. In the case of SiO, the\nobserved abundance depletion with increasing density is most likely caused by\nan efficient incorporation onto dust grains.

Moreover, they are vulnerable to DDoS and Sybil attacks due to\nmalicious users involvement. Besides, high fees should be paid to the service\nprovider. In this paper, we propose a decentralized ride-sharing service based\non public Blockchain, named B-Ride. Both riders and drivers can find rides\nmatch while preserving their trip data, including pick-up/drop-off location,\nand departure/arrival date. However, under the anonymity of the public\nblockchain, a malicious user may submit multiple ride requests or offers, while\nnot committing to any of them, to discover better offer or to make the system\nunreliable. B-Ride solves this problem by introducing a time-locked deposit\nprotocol for a ride-sharing by leveraging smart contract and zero-knowledge set\nmembership proof. In a nutshell, both a driver and a rider have to show their\ncommitment by sending a deposit to the blockchain. Later, a driver has to prove\nto the blockchain on the agreed departure time that he has arrived at the\npick-up location. To preserve rider/driver location privacy by hiding the exact\npick-up location, the proof is done using zero-knowledge set membership\nprotocol. Moreover, to ensure a fair payment, a pay-as-you-drive methodology is\nintroduced based on the elapsed distance of the driver and the rider. Also, we\nintroduce a reputation-based trust model to rate drivers based on their past\ntrips to allow riders to select them based on their history on the system.\nFinally, we implement B-Ride in a test net of Ethereum.

The particle ultimately achieves\nfirst-passage, leaving the medium or it is absorbed. The Kubelka-Munk model\ndescribes a flux of particles moving perpendicular to the surface of a\nplane-parallel medium. The particle path alternates between the positive\ndirection into the medium and the negative direction back towards the surface.\nBackscattering events from the positive to the negative direction occur at\nlocal maxima or peaks, while backscattering from the negative to the positive\ndirection occur at local minima or valleys. The probability of a particle\navoiding absorption as it follows its path decreases exponentially with the\npath-length \\(\\lambda\\). The reflectance of a semi-infinite slab is therefore\nthe Laplace transform of the distribution of path-length that ends with a\nfirst-passage out of the medium.

The characteristic time for this\nmotion towards the bulk to happen, quantified as the time particles spend\ninside the thermal boundary layers (BLs) at the plates, is shown to depend on\nthe thermal response time, $\\tau_T$, and the thermal expansion coefficient of\nparticles relative to that of the fluid, $K = \\alpha_p / \\alpha_f$.
