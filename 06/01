Here, we use the tip of a scanning tunneling\nmicroscope to abstract one of the pyrrolic hydrogen atoms from phthalocyanine\n(H2Pc) deposited on a single layer of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) on Au(111).\nWe show the successful dissociation reaction by current-induced three-level\nfluctuations reflecting the inequivalent positions of the remaining H atom in\nthe pyrrole center. Tunneling spectroscopy reveals two narrow resonances inside\nthe semiconducting energy gap of MoS2 with their spatial extent resembling the\nhighest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of H2Pc. By comparison to simple\ndensity functional calculations of the isolated molecule, we show that these\ncorrespond to a single occupation of the Coulomb-split highest molecular\norbital of HPc. We conclude that the dangling $\\sigma$ bond after N-H bond\ncleavage is filled by an electron from the delocalized HOMO. The extended\nnature of the HOMO together with the inert nature of the MoS2 layer favor the\nstabilization of this radical state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2019 16:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

Short of designing new RNN architectures,\nprevious methods for dealing with this problem usually boil down to\northogonalization of the recurrent dynamics, either at initialization or during\nthe entire training period. The basic motivation behind these methods is that\northogonal transformations are isometries of the Euclidean space, hence they\npreserve (Euclidean) norms and effectively deal with vanishing/exploding\ngradients. However, this ignores the crucial effects of non-linearity and\nnoise. In the presence of a non-linearity, orthogonal transformations no longer\npreserve norms, suggesting that alternative transformations might be better\nsuited to non-linear networks. Moreover, in the presence of noise, norm\npreservation itself ceases to be the ideal objective. A more sensible objective\nis maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the propagated signal instead.\nPrevious work has shown that in the linear case, recurrent networks that\nmaximize the SNR display strongly non-normal, sequential dynamics and\northogonal networks are highly suboptimal by this measure. Motivated by this\nfinding, here we investigate the potential of non-normal RNNs, i.e. RNNs with a\nnon-normal recurrent connectivity matrix, in sequential processing tasks. Our\nexperimental results show that non-normal RNNs outperform their orthogonal\ncounterparts in a diverse range of benchmarks.

Arrays are important\nfor the performance of many memory-intensive applications due to the design of\nmodern memory hierarchies: contiguous storage facilitates spatial locality and\npredictive access patterns which enables prefetching. Operations on large\narrays often lend themselves well to parallelisation, such as a fork-join style\ndivide-and-conquer algorithm for sorting. For parallel operations on arrays to\nbe deterministic, data-race freedom must be guaranteed. For operations on\narrays of primitive data, data-race freedom is obtained by coordinating\naccesses so that no two threads operate on the same array indices. This is\nhowever not enough for arrays of non-primitives due to aliasing: accesses of\nseparate array elements may return pointers to the same object, or overlapping\nstructures. Reference capabilities have been used successfully in the past to\nstatically guarantee the absence of data-races in object-oriented programs.\nThis paper presents the first extension of reference capabilities -- called\narray capabilities -- that support concurrent and parallel operations on arrays\nof both primitive and non-primitive values. In addition to element access,\narray capabilities support the abstract manipulation of arrays, logical\nsplitting of arrays into subarrays, and merging subarrays. These operations\nallow expressing a wide range of array use cases.

In the first model, if a new update arrives when the service\nis busy, it is blocked; in the second model, a new update preempts the current\nupdate in service. For the blocking model, we first derive an exact age\nexpression, then we propose two simple to calculate upper bounds for the\naverage age. The first upper bound assumes the interarrival times to have\nlog-concave distribution. The second upper bound assumes both the interarrivals\nand service times to have log-concave distribution. Both upper bounds are tight\nin the case of M/M/1/1 systems. We show that deterministic interarrivals and\nservice times are optimum for the blocking service model. In addition, using\nthe age expression for G/G/1/1 systems, we calculate average age expressions\nfor special cases, i.e., M/G/1/1 and G/M/1/1 systems.

In addition, similar to blocking discipline, using the age expression for\nG/G/1/1 systems, we calculate average age expressions for special cases, i.e.,\nM/G/1/1 and G/M/1/1 systems. Average age for G/M/1/1 can be written as a\nsummation of two terms, the first of which depends only on the first and second\nmoments of interarrival times and the second of which depends only on the\nservice rate. In other words, interarrival and service times are decoupled. We\nshow that deterministic interarrivals are optimum for G/M/1/1 systems. On the\nother hand, we observe for non-exponential service times that the optimal\ndistribution of interarrival times depends on the relative values of the mean\ninterarrival time and the mean service time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2019 17:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-03"}

A recently discovered\npopulation of so-called naked red nuggets, galaxies that shortcut the ex-situ\nstage preserving their pristine properties, presents a unique opportunity to\nstudy in detail star formation in massive galaxies without the confounding\neffect of later accretion. We investigate the spatially resolved star formation\nhistories of a sample of 12 naked red nuggets.

We find that, while forming stars, red nuggets become gradually more\nconcentrated, reaching a maximum concentration at quenching.

Our\nmeasurements suggest that super-massive black holes and host galaxies grow\ntheir mass in a self-regulated way until a characteristic Mbh/Mhalo is reached.\nOnce black holes are massive enough, red nuggets get quenched and depart from\nthe star formation main sequence. While in the main sequence, red nuggets\nevolve at roughly constant star formation rate. This can explain up to ~0.3 dex\nof the scatter of the star formation main sequence, as well as its higher\nnormalization observed in the early Universe.

During this early\nmatter-dominated era, density perturbations will grow more quickly than\notherwise predicted, leading to a large abundance of sub-earth-mass dark matter\nmicrohalos. Since the dark matter does not couple directly to the Standard\nModel, the minimum halo mass is much smaller than expected for weakly\ninteracting dark matter, and the smallest halos could form during the\nradiation-dominated era. In this paper, we calculate the evolution of density\nperturbations within the context of such hidden sector models and use a series\nof $N$-body simulations to determine the outcome of nonlinear collapse during\nradiation domination. The resulting microhalos are extremely dense, which leads\nto very high rates of dark matter annihilation and to large indirect detection\nsignals that resemble those ordinarily predicted for decaying dark matter. We\nfind that the Fermi Collaboration's measurement of the high-latitude gamma-ray\nbackground rules out a wide range of parameter space within this class of\nmodels. The scenarios that are most difficult to constrain are those that\nfeature a very long early matter-dominated era; if microhalos form prior to the\ndecay of the unstable hidden sector matter, the destruction of these microhalos\neffectively heats the dark matter, suppressing the later formation of\nmicrohalos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2019 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

We do not find a\nconsistent relationship between the degree of test particle inclination\nexcitation and e-folding planet migration timescales in the range 5-50 Myr. Our\nresults present a counter-example to Nesvorny 2015's finding that the Plutino\nand hot classical inclinations showed a marked increase with increasing\ne-folding timescales for Neptune's migration.

However we note that separate fits to\nthe appearance and disappearance oscillation data sets within a 3+1 model do\nnot show the expected overlapping allowed regions in parameter space. This\n\"tension\" leads us to explore two options: 3+2, where a second additional mass\nstate is introduced, and a 3+1+decay model, where the $\\nu_4$ state can decay\nto invisible particles. The 3+1+decay model, which is also motivated by\nimproving compatibility with cosmological observations, yields the larger\nimprovement, with a $\\Delta \\chi^2=8$ for 1 additional parameter beyond the 3+1\nmodel, which is a $2.6\\sigma$ improvement.

Each chemical\ncomponent in the material under investigation has a characteristic absorption\nand phase contrast as a function of photon energy.

To tackle this issue from a\ncomputational perspective, Garimella et al. (NIPS'17) modeled the spread of\nthese viewpoints, also called campaigns, using the well-known independent\ncascade model and studied an optimization problem that aims at balancing\ninformation exposure in a social network when two opposing campaigns propagate\nin the network. The objective in their $NP$-hard optimization problem is to\nmaximize the number of people that are exposed to either both or none of the\nviewpoints. For two different settings, one corresponding to a model where\ncampaigns spread in a correlated manner, and a second one, where the two\ncampaigns spread in a heterogeneous manner, they provide constant ratio\napproximation algorithms.

While there is a surge of interest to understand the security\nissues of machine learning, their implications have not been understood yet for\nwireless applications such as those in IoT systems that are susceptible to\nvarious attacks due the open and broadcast nature of wireless communications.\nTo support IoT systems with heterogeneous devices of different priorities, we\npresent new techniques built upon adversarial machine learning and apply them\nto three types of over-the-air (OTA) wireless attacks, namely jamming, spectrum\npoisoning, and priority violation attacks. By observing the spectrum, the\nadversary starts with an exploratory attack to infer the channel access\nalgorithm of an IoT transmitter by building a deep neural network classifier\nthat predicts the transmission outcomes. Based on these prediction results, the\nwireless attack continues to either jam data transmissions or manipulate\nsensing results over the air (by transmitting during the sensing phase) to fool\nthe transmitter into making wrong transmit decisions in the test phase\n(corresponding to an evasion attack). When the IoT transmitter collects sensing\nresults as training data to retrain its channel access algorithm, the adversary\nlaunches a causative attack to manipulate the input data to the transmitter\nover the air. We show that these attacks with different levels of energy\nconsumption and stealthiness lead to significant loss in throughput and success\nratio in wireless communications for IoT systems. Then we introduce a defense\nmechanism that systematically increases the uncertainty of the adversary at the\ninference stage and improves the performance.

However,\nwith unequal and unknown intensities the curse returns regardless of the\nmeasurement, though the ideal scheme would still outperform image plane\ncounting (IPC), i.e., recording intensities on a screen. We analyze the limits\nof the SPLICE phase measurement scheme as the intensity imbalance between the\nemitters grows. We find that SPLICE still outperforms IPC for moderately\ndisparate intensities. For larger intensity imbalances we propose a hybrid of\nIPC and SPLICE, which we call \"adapted SPLICE\", requiring only simple\nmodifications. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we identify regions (emitter\nbrightness, separation, intensity imbalance) where it is advantageous to use\nSPLICE over IPC, and when to switch to the adapted SPLICE measurement.

Leaving\nagents to selfishly optimize comes with the risk of ending up in sub-optimal\nstates (in terms of performance and/or costs), compared to a centralized system\ndesign. However, the PoA relies on strong assumptions about agents' rationality\n(e.g., resources and information) and interactions, whereas in many distributed\nsystems agents interact locally with bounded resources. They do so repeatedly\nover time (in contrast to \"one-shot games\"), and their strategies may evolve.\nUsing a more realistic evolutionary game model, this paper introduces a\nrealized evolutionary Price of Anarchy (ePoA). The ePoA allows an exploration\nof equilibrium selection in dynamic distributed systems with multiple\nequilibria, based on local interactions of simple memoryless agents.\nConsidering a fundamental game related to virus propagation on networks, we\npresent analytical bounds on the ePoA in basic network topologies and for\ndifferent strategy update dynamics. In particular, deriving stationary\ndistributions of the stochastic evolutionary process, we find that the Nash\nequilibria are not always the most abundant states, and that different\nprocesses can feature significant off-equilibrium behavior, leading to a\nsignificantly higher ePoA compared to the PoA studied traditionally in the\nliterature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2019 22:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-04"}

Mainly due to\nits morphology, the nebula has been suggested to be a 0.5 Myr-old supernova\nremnant (SNR) that could be inducing star formation in the CMa OB1 association.\nWe aim to show, for the first time, that the nebula is part of a large,\nshell-like structure, which we have designated the ``CMa shell'', enclosing a\nbubble created by successive supernova (SN) explosions. We identified three\nrunaway stars, associated with bow-shock structures, in the direction of the\nCMa shell and we investigate the possibility that they have originated in the\ncenter of the shell. By analyzing images of the CMa OB1 association at several\nwavelengths, we clearly see that the Sh2-296 nebula is in fact part of a large\nstructure, which can be approximated by a large (with a diameter of ~60 pc)\nelliptical shell. Using the recent Gaia-DR2 astrometric data, we trace back the\npath of the three runaway stars, in order to find their original position in\nthe past, with relation to the CMa shell. We also revise the heating and\nionization of the Sh2-296 nebula, by comparing the photon budget provided by\nthe O stars in the region with results from radio observations.

Of\nparticular interest are wetlands, a type of ecosystem that constitutes the most\neffective terrestrial long-term carbon store. As permafrost thaws, the carbon\nthat was locked in these wetland soils for millennia becomes available for\naerobic and anaerobic decomposition, which releases CO2 and CH4, respectively,\nback to the atmosphere.As CO2 and CH4 are potent greenhouse gases, this\ntransfer of carbon from the land to the atmosphere further contributes to\nglobal warming, thereby increasing the rate of permafrost degradation in a\npositive feedback loop. Therefore, monitoring Arctic wetland health and\ndynamics is a key scientific task that is also of importance for policy.\nHowever, the identification and delineation of these important wetland\necosystems, remain incomplete and often inaccurate. Mapping the extent of\nArctic wetlands remains a challenge for the scientific community. Conventional,\ncoarser remote sensing methods are inadequate at distinguishing the diverse and\nmicro-topographically complex non-vascular vegetation that characterize Arctic\nwetlands, presenting the need for better identification methods.

However, extension of this notion\nto videos for recovering temporally coherent poses still remains unexplored. A\nmajor challenge in this regard is the lack of appropriately annotated video\ndata for learning the desired deep models. Existing human pose datasets only\nprovide 2D or 3D skeleton joint annotations, whereas the datasets are also\nrecorded in constrained environments. We first contribute a technique to\nsynthesize monocular action videos with rich 3D annotations that are suitable\nfor learning computational models for full mesh 3D human pose recovery.\nCompared to the existing methods which simply \"texture-map\" clothes onto the 3D\nhuman pose models, our approach incorporates Physics based realistic cloth\ndeformations with the human body movements. The generated videos cover a large\nvariety of human actions, poses, and visual appearances, whereas the\nannotations record accurate human pose dynamics and human body surface\ninformation. Our second major contribution is an end-to-end trainable Recurrent\nNeural Network for full pose mesh recovery from monocular video. Using the\nproposed video data and LSTM based recurrent structure, our network explicitly\nlearns to model the temporal coherence in videos and imposes geometric\nconsistency over the recovered meshes.

Motivated by the fact that semantic\nsegmentation is a mature algorithm on image data, we explore sensor fusion\nbased 3D segmentation. Our main contribution is to convert the RGB image to a\npolar-grid mapping representation used for LiDAR and design early and mid-level\nfusion architectures. Additionally, we design a hybrid fusion architecture that\ncombines both fusion algorithms. We evaluate our algorithm on KITTI dataset\nwhich provides segmentation annotation for cars, pedestrians and cyclists.

Specifically, the\nco-channel terrestrial users' messages are shared with the UAV's serving BSs\nand transmitted via CB to cancel their resultant interference at the UAV. To\nbalance between the CB gains for UAV signal enhancement and interference\ncancellation, we aim to maximize the UAV's receive\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio by jointly optimizing the power\nallocations at all of its serving BSs for transmitting the UAV's and co-channel\nterrestrial users' messages.

The\nexperimental results are promising: the fused image generated by our approach\ngreatly reduces the semantic information loss, and has better visual effects in\ncontrast to five state-of-art approaches. Our approach and tool have great\npotential to be applied in the clinical setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jun 2019 14:13:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 06:44:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-12"}

In doing so, datacenter operators employ streaming analytics for\ncollecting and processing datacenter telemetry over a temporal window. The\nquantile operator is key to these systems as it can summarize the typical and\nabnormal behavior of the monitored system. Computing quantiles in real-time is\nresource-intensive as it requires processing hundreds of millions of events in\nseconds while providing high accuracy.\n  We overcome these challenges in real-time quantile computation through\nworkload-driven approximation, motivated by three insights in our study: (i)\nvalues are dominated by a set of recurring small values, (ii) distribution of\nsmall values is consistent across different time scales, and (iii) tail values\nare dominated by a small set of large values. That is, we propose AOMG, an\nefficient and accurate quantile approximation algorithm that capitalizes on\nthese insights. AOMG minimizes memory footprint of the quantile operator via\ncompression and frequency-based summarization of small values. While these\nsummaries are stored and processed at sub-window granularity for memory\nefficiency, they can extend to compute quantiles on user-defined temporal\nwindows. Low value error for tail quantiles is achieved by retaining a few tail\nvalues per subwindow. AOMG estimates quantiles with high throughput and less\nthan 5% relative value error across a wide range of use cases while\nstate-of-the-art algorithms either have a high relative value error\n(9.3-137.0%) or deliver lower throughput (15-92%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jun 2019 14:18:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2019 14:14:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 15:53:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-18"}

As each multimedia item can be represented as multiple fine-grained\nvisual images (e.g., related images of the movie), personalized key frame\nrecommendation is necessary in these applications to attract users' unique\nvisual preferences. However, previous personalized key frame recommendation\nmodels relied on users' fine-grained image behavior of multimedia items (e.g.,\nuser-image interaction behavior), which is often not available in real\nscenarios. In this paper, we study the general problem of joint multimedia item\nand key frame recommendation in the absence of the fine-grained user-image\nbehavior. We argue that the key challenge of this problem lies in discovering\nusers' visual profiles for key frame recommendation, as most recommendation\nmodels would fail without any users' fine-grained image behavior. To tackle\nthis challenge, we leverage users' item behavior by projecting users (items) in\ntwo latent spaces: a collaborative latent space and a visual latent space. We\nfurther design a model to discern both the collaborative and visual dimensions\nof users, and model how users make decisive item preferences from these two\nspaces. As a result, the learned user visual profiles could be directly applied\nfor key frame recommendation. Finally, experimental results on a real-world\ndataset clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model on the two\nrecommendation tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jun 2019 15:34:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Jan 2020 06:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

In our setup, we consider the case when the climate system\nstarts from its warm attractor (the stable climate we experience today), and\nthe solar constant is decreased continuously in finite time, according to a\nparameter drift scenario, to a state, where only the Snowball Earth's attractor\nremains stable. This induces an inevitable transition, or climate tipping from\nthe warm climate. The reverse transition is also discussed.

It is also observed\nthat the FPGA performs increasingly better as a vision application's pipeline\ncomplexity grows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2019 21:25:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-01"}

The key novelty of this paper is that it shows that using\nper-image semantic supervision leads to substantial improvement in zero-shot\nperformance over using class-only supervision. On top of that, we provide a\nprobabilistic justification for a metric rescaling approach that solves a very\ncommon problem in the generalized zero-shot learning setting, i.e., classifying\ntest images from unseen classes as one of the classes seen during training. We\nevaluate our approach on two fine-grained zero-shot learning datasets: CUB and\nFLOWERS. We find that on the generalized zero-shot classification task CLAREL\nconsistently outperforms the existing approaches on both datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 2019 22:24:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 15:37:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2020 14:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

Starting from the centralized\nprojected gradient descent, an iterative and distributed solution was proposed\nthat responds to streaming data and employs stochastic approximations in place\nof actual gradient vectors, which are generally unavailable. We examined the\nsecond-order stability of the learning algorithm and we showed that, for small\nstep-sizes $\\mu$, the proposed strategy leads to small estimation errors on the\norder of $\\mu$. This Part II examines steady-state performance. The results\nreveal explicitly the influence of the gradient noise, data characteristics,\nand subspace constraints, on the network performance.
