This is most\nevident for the ubiquitous MobileNet architecture which requires a costly\nquantization-aware training cycle to achieve acceptable performance when\nquantized to 8-bits. In this paper, we trace the source of the degradation in\nMobileNets to a shift in the mean activation value. This shift is caused by an\ninherent bias in the quantization process which builds up across layers,\nshifting all network statistics away from the learned distribution. We show\nthat this phenomenon happens in other architectures as well. We propose a\nsimple remedy - compensating for the quantization induced shift by adding a\nconstant to the additive bias term of each channel. We develop two simple\nmethods for estimating the correction constants - one using iterative\nevaluation of the quantized network and one where the constants are set using a\nshort training phase. Both methods are fast and require only a small amount of\nunlabeled data, making them appealing for rapid deployment of neural networks.\nUsing the above methods we are able to match the performance of training-based\nquantization of MobileNets at a fraction of the cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 16:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}

On the one\nhand, we find modular pipelines, which divide the driving task into sub-tasks\nsuch as perception and maneuver planning and control. On the other hand, we\nfind end-to-end driving approaches that try to learn a direct mapping from\ninput raw sensor data to vehicle control signals. The later are relatively less\nstudied, but are gaining popularity since they are less demanding in terms of\nsensor data annotation. This paper focuses on end-to-end autonomous driving. So\nfar, most proposals relying on this paradigm assume RGB images as input sensor\ndata.

The method automatically recognizes cyclic patterns in data\n- even when they change repeatedly - and reduces communication load whenever\nthe current data can be accurately predicted from previous cycles. Nonetheless,\na bounded error between original and received signal is guaranteed. The cyclic\nexcitation model, which is used for predictions, is updated hierarchically,\ni.e., a full model update is only performed if updating a small number of model\nparameters is not sufficient. A nonparametric statistical test enforces that\nmodel updates happen only if the cyclic excitation changed with high\nprobability. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated using\nthe application example of wireless real-time pitch angle measurements of a\nhuman foot in a feedback-controlled neuroprosthesis.

It is therefore crucial to extend searches for globular cluster streams\nto other galaxies than the Milky Way. In this paper, we investigate the current\nand future prospects of detecting globular cluster streams in external galaxies\nin resolved stars (e.g. with WFIRST) and using integrated light (e.g. with HSC,\nLSST and Euclid). In particular, we inject mock-streams to data from the PAndAS\nM31 survey, and produce simulated M31 backgrounds mimicking what WFIRST will\nobserve in M31. Additionally, we estimate the distance limit to which globular\ncluster streams will be observable. Our results demonstrate that for a 1 hour\n(1000 sec.) exposure, using conservative estimates, WFIRST should detect\nglobular cluster streams in resolved stars in galaxies out to distances of ~3.5\nMpc (~2 Mpc). This volume contains 199 (122) galaxies of which >90% are dwarfs.\nWith integrated light, thin streams can be resolved out to ~100 Mpc with HSC\nand LSST and to ~600 Mpc with WFIRST and Euclid. The low surface brightness of\nthe streams (typically >30 mag/arcsec$^2$), however, will make them difficult\nto detect, unless the streams originate from very young clusters. We emphasize\nthat if the external galaxies do not host spiral arms or galactic bars, gaps in\ntheir stellar streams provide an ideal test case for evidence of interactions\nwith dark matter subhalos. Furthermore, obtaining a large samples of thin\nstellar streams can help constrain the orbital structure and hence the\npotentials of external halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

The host\nstar, KELT-24 (HD 93148), has a $T_{\\rm eff}$ =$6509^{+50}_{-49}$ K, a mass of\n$M_{*}$ = $1.460^{+0.055}_{-0.059}$ $M_{\\odot}$, radius of $R_{*}$ =\n$1.506\\pm0.022$ $R_{\\odot}$, and an age of $0.78^{+0.61}_{-0.42}$ Gyr. Its\nplanetary companion (KELT-24 b) has a radius of $R_{\\rm P}$ = $1.272\\pm0.021$\n$R_{\\rm J}$, a mass of $M_{\\rm P}$ = $5.18^{+0.21}_{-0.22}$ $M_{\\rm J}$, and\nfrom Doppler tomographic observations, we find that the planet's orbit is\nwell-aligned to its host star's projected spin axis ($\\lambda$ =\n$2.6^{+5.1}_{-3.6}$). The young age estimated for KELT-24 suggests that it only\nrecently started to evolve from the zero-age main sequence. KELT-24 is the\nbrightest star known to host a transiting giant planet with a period between 5\nand 10 days. Although the circularization timescale is much longer than the age\nof the system, we do not detect a large eccentricity or significant\nmisalignment that is expected from dynamical migration. The brightness of its\nhost star and its moderate surface gravity make KELT-24b an intriguing target\nfor detailed atmospheric characterization through spectroscopic emission\nmeasurements since it would bridge the current literature results that have\nprimarily focused on lower mass hot Jupiters and a few brown dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 18:04:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 20:22:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

At the first stage, the\nscene understanding module will categorize the RGB image into different\ndepth-ranges. We introduce two different scene understanding modules based on\nscene classification and coarse depth estimation respectively. At the second\nstage, SIDE networks trained by the images of specific depth-range are applied\nto obtain an accurate depth map. In order to improve the accuracy, we further\ndesign a multi-task encoding-decoding SIDE network DS-SIDENet based on\ndepthwise separable convolutions. DS-SIDENet is optimized to minimize both\ndepth classification and depth regression losses. This improves the accuracy\ncompared to a single-task SIDE network. Experimental results demonstrate that\ntraining DS-SIDENet on an individual dataset such as NYU achieves competitive\nperformance to the state-of-art methods with much better efficiency.

We empirically\nfind that the mean lepton Lorentz factor in the post-reconnection region\ndepends on $\\sigma, \\Theta_e$, and $\\sigma_{e,h}$ as $\\langle \\gamma_e-1\\rangle\n\\approx \\sqrt{\\sigma}(1+4\\Theta_e)\\left(1+\\sigma_{e,h}/30\\right)$, for\n$\\sigma\\ge1$. The high-energy part of the post-reconnection lepton energy\ndistributions can be described by a power law, whose slope is mainly controlled\nby $\\sigma_{e,h}$ for $\\kappa \\gtrsim 3-6$, with harder power laws obtained for\nhigher magnetizations. We finally show that reconnection in pair-proton plasmas\nwith multiplicities $\\kappa \\sim 1-20$, magnetizations $\\sigma \\sim 1-10$, and\ntemperatures $\\Theta_e \\sim 1-10$ results in particle power law slopes and\naverage electron Lorentz factors that are consistent with those inferred in\nleptonic models of AGN jet emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 18:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

These were compared to energies of excited\nstates in $^{89}$Y at 1507.4(1) keV, and in $^{139}$La at 2310(19) keV and\n2313(1) keV to determine $Q$-values of -5.20(37) keV for the potential\nultra-low $\\beta$-decay branch of $^{89}$Sr and -1.6(19.0) keV and -4.6(1.2)\nkeV for those of $^{139}$Ba. Conclusion: The potential ultra-low $Q$-value\ndecay branch of $^{89}$Sr to the $^{89}$Y (3/2$^-$, 1507.4 keV) state is\nenergetically forbidden and has been ruled out. The potential ultra-low\n$Q$-value decay branch of $^{139}$Ba to the 2313 keV state in $^{139}$La with\nunknown J$^{\\pi}$ has also been ruled out at the 4$\\sigma$ level, while more\nprecise energy level data is needed for the $^{139}$La (1/2$^+$, 2310 keV)\nstate to determine if an ultra-low $Q$-value $\\beta$-decay branch to this state\nis energetically allowed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 21:11:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 15:45:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-08"}

Bien and Tibshirani\nanalyzed properties of this method in 2011 [2], popularizing the method within\nthe statistics community. Additionally, they performed comparisons of minimax\nlinkage to standard linkage methods, making use of five data sets and two\ndifferent evaluation metrics (distance to prototype and misclassification\nrate). In an effort to expand upon their work and evaluate minimax linkage more\ncomprehensively, our benchmark study focuses on thorough method evaluation via\nmultiple performance metrics on several well-described data sets. We also make\nall code and data publicly available through an R package, for full\nreproducibility. Similarly to [2], we find that minimax linkage often produces\nthe smallest maximum minimax radius of all linkage methods, meaning that\nminimax linkage produces clusters where objects in a cluster are tightly\nclustered around their prototype. This is true across a range of values for the\ntotal number of clusters (k). However, this is not always the case, and special\nattention should be paid to the case when k is the true known value. For true\nk, minimax linkage does not always perform the best in terms of all the\nevaluation metrics studied, including maximum minimax radius. This paper was\nmotivated by the IFCS Cluster Benchmarking Task Force's call for clustering\nbenchmark studies and the white paper [5], which put forth guidelines and\nprinciples for comprehensive benchmarking in clustering.

In this paper, we focus on accurate early labeling of\nnews, and propose a model by considering earliness both in modeling and\nprediction. The proposed method utilizes recurrent neural networks with a novel\nloss function, and a new stopping rule. Given the context of news, we first\nembed it with a class-specific text representation. Then, we utilize the\navailable public profile of users, and speed of news diffusion, for early\nlabeling of the news. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our model both in terms of early labelling and accuracy,\ncompared to the state of the art baseline and models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jun 2019 08:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-06"}

In particular, we focus on how the epidemic threshold of the SIR model\nis affected by the heterogeneity of nodal activities and the memory strength in\ntemporal and static regimes, respectively. While strong ties (memory) between\nnodes inhibit the spread of epidemic to be localized, the heterogeneity of\nnodal activities enhances it to be globalized initially. Since the epidemic\nthreshold of the SIR model is very sensitive to the degree distribution of\nnodes in static networks, we test the SIR model on the modified ADTNs with the\npossible set of the activity exponents and the memory exponents that generates\nthe same degree distributions in temporal networks. We also discuss the role of\nspatiotemporal scaling properties of the largest cluster and the maximum degree\nin the epidemic threshold. It is observed that the presence of highly active\nnodes enables to trigger the initial spread of epidemic in a short period of\ntime, but it also limits its final spread to the entire network. This implies\nthat there is the trade-off between the spreading time of epidemic and its\noutbreak size. Finally, we suggest the phase diagram of the SIR model on ADTNs\nand the optimal condition for the spread of epidemic under the circumstances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jun 2019 12:07:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 18:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

However, how to assess the patch correctness remains to be an open\nchallenge. Two widely adopted ways to approach this challenge, including\nmanually checking and validating using automated generated tests, are biased\n(i.e., suffering from subjectivity and low precision respectively). Aim: To\naddress this concern, we propose to conduct an empirical study towards\nunderstanding the correct patches that are generated by existing\nstate-of-the-art APR techniques, aiming at providing guidelines for future\nassessment of patches. Method: To this end, we first present a Literature\nReview (LR) on the reported correct patches generated by recent techniques on\nthe Defects4J benchmark and collect 177 correct patches after a process of\nsanity check. We investigate how these machine-generated correct patches\nachieve semantic equivalence, but syntactic difference compared with\ndeveloper-provided ones, how these patches distribute in different projects and\nAPR techniques, and how the characteristics of a bug affect the patches\ngenerated for it. Results: Our main findings include 1) we do not need to fix\nbugs exactly like how developers do since we observe that 25.4% (45/177) of the\ncorrect patches generated by APR techniques are syntactically different from\ndeveloper-provided ones; 2) the distribution of machine-generated correct\npatches diverges for the aspects of Defects4J projects and APR techniques; and\n3) APR techniques tend to generate patches that are different from those by\ndevelopers for bugs with large patch sizes. Conclusion: Our study not only\nverifies the conclusions from previous studies but also highlights implications\nfor future study towards assessing patch correctness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jun 2019 12:30:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}

Based on\nthis observation, we propose three novel deep learning approaches that utilize\nMahalanobis distance. Our first approach uses user-playlist-song interactions,\nand combines Mahalanobis distance scores between (i) a target user and a target\nsong, and (ii) between a target playlist and the target song to account for\nboth the user's preference and the playlist's theme. Our second approach\nmeasures song-song similarities by considering Mahalanobis distance scores\nbetween the target song and each member song (i.e., existing song) in the\ntarget playlist. The contribution of each distance score is measured by our\nproposed memory metric-based attention mechanism. In the third approach, we\nfuse the two previous models into a unified model to further enhance their\nperformance. In addition, we adopt and customize Adversarial Personalized\nRanking (APR) for our three approaches to further improve their robustness and\npredictive capabilities.

We\ndevelop for this problem two robust schemes based on domain decomposition (DD)\nmethods and operator-splitting techniques. The first scheme follows a\nsequential procedure in which the (global) pressure, the saturation-advection\nand the saturation-diffusion problems are fully decoupled. In this scheme, each\nproblem is treated individually using various DD approaches and specialized\nnumerical methods. The coupling between the different problems is explicit and\nthe time-marching is with no iterations. To adapt to different time scales of\nproblem components and different rock types, the novel scheme uses a multirate\ntime stepping strategy, by taking multiple finer time steps for\nsaturation-advection within one coarse time step for saturation-diffusion and\npressure, and permits independent time steps for the advection step in the\ndifferent rocks. In the second scheme, we review the classical Implicit\nPressure--Explicit Saturation (IMPES) method (by decoupling only pressure and\nsaturation) in the context of multirate coupling schemes and\nnonconforming-in-time DD approaches. For the discretization, the\nsaturation-advection problem is approximated with the explicit Euler method in\ntime, and in space with the cell-centered finite volume method of first order\nof Godunov type. The saturation-diffusion problem is approximated in time with\nthe implicit Euler method and in space with the mixed finite element method, as\nin the pressure problem.

In these domains where safety is highly critical, an erroneous\ndecision can result in serious consequences. While a perfect prediction\naccuracy is not always achievable, recent work on Bayesian deep networks shows\nthat it is possible to know when DNNs are more likely to make mistakes. Knowing\nwhat DNNs do not know is desirable to increase the safety of deep learning\ntechnology in sensitive applications. Bayesian neural networks attempt to\naddress this challenge. However, traditional approaches are computationally\nintractable and do not scale well to large, complex neural network\narchitectures.

In this\npaper the design and performance of a NB-IoT uplink receiver is studied in\ndetail. First, receiver design for NB-IoT uplink channels, with corresponding\nmathematical analysis, is presented. Specifically, it is shown how the\ntime/frequency structure of signals can be exploited to enhance the receiver\nperformance. Second, the performance of each channel is characterized with both\nlink level simulations and implementation on a commercially deployed\nQualcomm(registered) FSM(Trade Mark) platform [1]. Comparisons against the 3GPP\ndefined Radio Performance and Protocol aspect requirements are also provided.\nFinally, implementation details are addressed and discussions on proposed\nenhancements to NB-IoT in 3GPP Release 15 are provided. It is shown how the\nproposed receiver algorithms can be adopted to Release 15 enhancements with\nminor or no modifications. The work in this paper is of significance to system\ndesigners looking to implement efficient NB-IoT uplink receiver to coexist with\nlegacy LTE systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 23:34:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 22:16:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-16"}

The paper opens with a\nbrief review of the development of an idea first advanced by Maupertui (1741):\nthe Dynamical Action Principle. The story reached a turning point with the\ncreation of Einstein's theory of General Relativity. The associated work of\nNoether served as an inspiration for particle physics for 100 years. The\ndiscovery of gravity waves (LIGO 2016) showed that Gravity is a phenomenon akin\nto, and part of, particle physics, to be treated as a canonical field theory,\nand eventually quantized. Here the subject is the theory of the classical\nmetric field in interaction with extended distributions of matter.We determine\na class of Noetherian field theories that provide extended sources for\nEinstein's equations and action integrals for classical hydrodynamics. The\nintimate relationship between hydrodynamics and General Relativity is\nemphasized. Results: The 2-form gauge theory of Ogievetskij and Polubarinov\n(1964) makes a crucial contribution to the matter source of gravity. Multiple,\nunexpected roles are played by `permittivities'. There is a unique,\nrelativistic hydrodynamics with 4 degrees of freedom that includes vorticity,\nthe equation of continuity and a generalization of the Bernoulli equation. It\nis based on an action principle and it reduces, in the non relativistic limit,\nto a simple generalization of Lagrange theory of 1760, with just one free\nparameter..\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 20:43:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 17:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

Although this process has been studied extensively, there are still\nopen questions about both the fundamental physics and the reconciliation of\ndifferent observations into a coherent quantitative view of this important\nmechanism for particle-turbulence interaction. In this work, we study the\neffect of projecting this phenomenon onto 2D and 1D (as usually done in\nexperiments). In particular, the effect of measurement volume in 1D projections\non detected cluster properties, such as size or concentration, is explored to\nprovide a method for comparison of published/future observations, from\nexperimental or numerical data. The results demonstrate that, in order to\ncapture accurate values of the mean cluster properties under a wide range of\nexperimental conditions, the measurement volume needs to be larger than the\nKolmogorov length scale, and smaller than about ten percent of the integral\nlength scale of the turbulence. This dependency provides the correct scaling to\ncarry out 1D measurements of preferential concentration, considering the\nturbulence characteristics. It is also critical to disentangle the\ncluster-characterizing results from random contributions to the cluster\nstatistics, especially in 1D, as the raw probability density function of\nVoronoi cells does not provide error-free information on the clusters size or\nlocal concentration. We propose a methodology to correct for this measurement\nbias, with an analytical model of the cluster PDF obtained from comparison with\na Random Poisson Process probability distribution in 1D, which appears to\ndiscard the existence of power laws in the cluster PDF. We develop a new test\nto discern between turbulence-driven clustering and randomness, that\ncomplements the cluster identification algorithm by segregating the number of\nparticles inside each cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jun 2019 15:26:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 07:34:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

In such models, the transformation of interest is\nparameterized by a fixed set of basis functions as for example B-splines. Each\nbasis function is located on a fixed regular grid position among the image\ndomain, because the transformation of interest is not known in advance. As a\nconsequence, not all basis functions will necessarily contribute to the final\ntransformation which results in a non-compact representation of the\ntransformation. We reformulate the pairwise registration problem as a recursive\nsequence of successive alignments. For each element in the sequence, a local\ndeformation defined by its position, shape, and weight is computed by our\nrecurrent registration neural network. The sum of all local deformations yield\nthe final spatial alignment of both images. Formulating the registration\nproblem in this way allows the network to detect non-aligned regions in the\nimages and to learn how to locally refine the registration properly. In\ncontrast to current non-sequence-based registration methods, our approach\niteratively applies local spatial deformations to the images until the desired\nregistration accuracy is achieved. We trained our network on 2D magnetic\nresonance images of the lung and compared our method to a standard parametric\nB-spline registration. The experiments show, that our method performs on par\nfor the accuracy but yields a more compact representation of the\ntransformation. Furthermore, we achieve a speedup of around 15 compared to the\nB-spline registration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 2019 16:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

These commonly used CNN models usually\nuse the same activation function, such as RELU, for all neurons in the\nconvolutional layers; they are \"Single-function CNNs.\" However, SCNNs may not\nalways be optimal. Thus, a \"Multi-function CNN\" (MCNN), which uses different\nactivation functions for different neurons, has been shown to outperform a\nSCNN. Also, CNNs typically have very large architectures that use a lot of\nmemory and need a lot of data in order to be trained well. As a result, they\ntend to have very high training and prediction times too. An important research\nproblem is how to automatically and efficiently find the best CNN with both\nhigh classification performance and compact architecture with high training and\nprediction speeds, small power usage, and small memory size for any image\nclassification problem. It is very useful to intelligently find an effective,\nfast, energy-efficient, and memory-efficient \"Compressed Multi-function CNN\"\n(CMCNN) from a large number of candidate MCNNs. A new compensatory algorithm\nusing a new genetic algorithm (GA) is created to find the best CMCNN with an\nideal compensation between performance and architecture size. The optimal CMCNN\nhas the best performance and the smallest architecture size. Simulations using\nthe CIFAR10 dataset showed that the new compensatory algorithm could find\nCMCNNs that could outperform non-compressed MCNNs in terms of classification\nperformance (F1-score), speed, power usage, and memory usage. Other effective,\nfast, power-efficient, and memory-efficient CMCNNs based on popular CNN\narchitectures will be developed for image classification problems in important\nreal-world applications, such as brain informatics and biomedical imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jun 2019 04:09:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-01"}
