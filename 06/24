To\nalleviate these issues, we propose a synchronous bidirectional sequence\ngeneration (SBSG) model which predicts its outputs from both sides to the\nmiddle simultaneously. In the SBSG model, we enable the left-to-right (L2R) and\nright-to-left (R2L) generation to help and interact with each other by\nleveraging interactive bidirectional attention network.

It is difficult to directly measure the\nsimilarity between images and descriptions due to the modality heterogeneity\n(the cross-modal problem). And all samples belonging to a single category (the\nfine-grained problem) makes this task even harder than the conventional\nimage-description matching task. In this paper, we propose a Multi-granularity\nImage-text Alignments (MIA) model to alleviate the cross-modal fine-grained\nproblem for better similarity evaluation in description-based person Re-id.\nSpecifically, three different granularities, i.e., global-global, global-local\nand local-local alignments are carried out hierarchically. Firstly, the\nglobal-global alignment in the Global Contrast (GC) module is for matching the\nglobal contexts of images and descriptions. Secondly, the global-local\nalignment employs the potential relations between local components and global\ncontexts to highlight the distinguishable components while eliminating the\nuninvolved ones adaptively in the Relation-guided Global-local Alignment (RGA)\nmodule. Thirdly, as for the local-local alignment, we match visual human parts\nwith noun phrases in the Bi-directional Fine-grained Matching (BFM) module. The\nwhole network combining multiple granularities can be end-to-end trained\nwithout complex pre-processing. To address the difficulties in training the\ncombination of multiple granularities, an effective step training strategy is\nproposed to train these granularities step-by-step.

Real people, on the other hand,\noften have systematic biases: risk-aversion, myopia, etc. One option is to try\nto characterize these biases and account for them explicitly during learning.\nBut in the era of deep learning, a natural suggestion researchers make is to\navoid mathematical models of human behavior that are fraught with specific\nassumptions, and instead use a purely data-driven approach.

In the GGP competition, an agent is\ngiven the rules of a game (described as a logic program) that it has never seen\nbefore. The task is for the agent to play the game, thus generating game\ntraces. The winner of the GGP competition is the agent that gets the best total\nscore over all the games. In this paper, we invert this task: a learner is\ngiven game traces and the task is to learn the rules that could produce the\ntraces. This problem is central to inductive general game playing (IGGP). We\nintroduce a technique that automatically generates IGGP tasks from GGP games.\nWe introduce an IGGP dataset which contains traces from 50 diverse games, such\nas Sudoku, Sokoban, and Checkers. We claim that IGGP is difficult for existing\ninductive logic programming (ILP) approaches. To support this claim, we\nevaluate existing ILP systems on our dataset. Our empirical results show that\nmost of the games cannot be correctly learned by existing systems. The best\nperforming system solves only 40% of the tasks perfectly. Our results suggest\nthat IGGP poses many challenges to existing approaches. Furthermore, because we\ncan automatically generate IGGP tasks from GGP games, our dataset will continue\nto grow with the GGP competition, as new games are added every year. We\ntherefore think that the IGGP problem and dataset will be valuable for\nmotivating and evaluating future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jun 2019 19:06:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

As the light intensity exceeds a certain threshold,\nlight-induced heating of the PCM layer triggers the phase transition\naccompanied by an abrupt change in its refractive index in the vicinity of the\ntransition temperature. The latter results in a shift of the nodal plane away\nfrom the metallic nanolayer, rendering the entire microcavity highly reflective\nover a broad frequency range. The nearly binary nature of the PCM refractive\nindex allows for the low-intensity resonant transmission over a broad range of\nambient temperatures below the transition point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jun 2019 19:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14"}

Recent work of\nAluffi introduces the Segre zeta function, a rational power series with integer\ncoefficients which captures the relationship between the Segre class of $Z$ and\nthose of its cones. The goal of this note is to define a relative version of\nthis construction for closed subschemes of projective bundles over a smooth\nvariety. If $Z$ is a closed subscheme of such a projective bundle $P(E)$, this\nrelative Segre zeta function will be a rational power series which describes\nthe Segre class of the cone over $Z$ in every projective bundle \"dominating\"\n$P(E)$. When the base variety is a point we recover the absolute Segre zeta\nfunction for projective spaces. Part of our construction requires $Z$ to be the\nzero scheme of a section of a bundle on $P(E)$ of rank smaller than that of $E$\nthat is able to extend to larger projective bundles. The question of what\nbundles may extend in this sense seems independently interesting and we discuss\nsome related results, showing that at a minimum one can always count on direct\nsums of line bundles to extend. Furthermore, the relative Segre zeta function\ndepends only on the Segre class of $Z$ and the total Chern class of the bundle\ndefining $Z$, and the basic forms of the numerator and denominator can be\ndescribed. As an application of our work we derive a Segre zeta function for\nproducts of projective spaces and prove its key properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jun 2019 21:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

For a particular choice of several physical parameter values,\nwe construct solutions with smooth initial data and finite energy that produce,\nin finite time, cusp singularities - blowups of gradients. The formation of\ncusp singularity is due to local interactions of wave-like characteristics of\nsolutions, which is different from the mechanism of finite time singularity\nformations for the parabolic Ericksen-Leslie system. The finite time\nsingularity formation for the physical model might raise some concerns for\npurposes of applications. This is, however, resolved satisfactorily; more\nprecisely, we are able to establish the global existence of weak solutions that\nare H\\\"older continuous and have bounded energy.

A\nhyperspectral camera was mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle to collect\naerial imagery with high spatial and spectral resolution. Aerial images were\ncaptured in two consecutive growing seasons from three experimental yield\nfields composed of hundreds experimental plots (1x2.4 meter), each contained a\nsingle wheat line. The grain of more than thousand wheat plots was harvested by\na combine, weighed, and recorded as the ground truth data. To leverage the high\nspatial resolution and investigate the yield variation within the plots, images\nof plots were divided into sub-plots by integrating image processing techniques\nand spectral mixture analysis with the expert domain knowledge.

To reduce the size, we superimposed focusing gradient and\nchromaticity compensating sextupole components over the dipole field utilizing\nsuperconducting magnets based on the Canted Cosine Theta (CCT) winding\ntechnology. The result is a model lattice with 50 pm horizontal emittance at 3\nGeV beam energy, with 400-500 m circumference and large 6D aperture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 02:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

Most existing deep adaptation methods focus on reducing\ndomain shift by matching marginal feature distributions through deep\ntransformations on the input features, due to the unavailability of target\ndomain labels. We show that domain shift may still exist via label distribution\nshift at the classifier, thus deteriorating model performances. To alleviate\nthis issue, we propose an approximate joint distribution matching scheme by\nexploiting prediction uncertainty. Specifically, we use a Bayesian neural\nnetwork to quantify prediction uncertainty of a classifier. By imposing\ndistribution matching on both features and labels (via uncertainty), label\ndistribution mismatching in source and target data is effectively alleviated,\nencouraging the classifier to produce consistent predictions across domains. We\nalso propose a few techniques to improve our method by adaptively reweighting\ndomain adaptation loss to achieve nontrivial distribution matching and stable\ntraining. Comparisons with state of the art unsupervised domain adaptation\nmethods on three popular benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our\napproach, especially on the effectiveness of alleviating negative transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 02:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

Yet, quantum teleportation in principle\nallows for a faithful and disembodied transmission of unknown quantum states\nbetween distant quantum systems using entanglement. There have been numerous\nexperiments on teleportation of quantum states of single photons, atoms,\ntrapped ions, defects in solid states, and superconducting circuits. However,\nall demonstrations to date were limited to a two-dimensional\nsubspace$-$so-called qubit$-$of the quantized multiple levels of the quantum\nsystems. In general, a quantum particle can naturally possess not only multiple\ndegrees of freedom, but also, many degrees of freedom can have high quantum\nnumber beyond the simplified two-level subspace. Here, making use of multiport\nbeam-splitters and ancillary single photons, we propose a resource-efficient\nand extendable scheme for teleportation of arbitrarily high-dimensional\nphotonic quantum states. We report the first experimental teleportation of a\nqutrit, which is equivalent to a spin-1 system. Measurements over a complete\nset of 12 states in mutually unbiased bases yield a teleportation fidelity of\n0.75(1), well above the optimal single-copy qutrit-state-estimation limit of\n1/2. The fidelity also exceeds the limit of 2/3, the maximum possible for\nexplanation through qubits only. Thus, we strictly prove a genuine\nthree-dimensional, universal, and highly non-classical quantum teleportation.\nCombining previous methods of teleportation of two-particle composite states\nand multiple degrees of freedom, our work provides a complete toolbox for\nteleporting a quantum particle intact. We expect that our results will pave the\nway for quantum technology applications in high dimensions, since teleportation\nplays a central role in quantum repeaters and quantum networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 03:06:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 02:05:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

Since the work by Guruswami and Wang, there have\nbeen some further investigations on the list decoding of insertion codes,\ndeletion codes and insdel codes. However, unlike classical Hamming metric or\neven rank-metric, there are still many unsolved problems on list decoding of\ninsdel codes.\n  The contributions of this paper mainly consist of two parts. Firstly, we\nanalyze the list decodability of random insdel codes. We show that list\ndecoding of random insdel codes surpasses the Singleton bound when there are\nmore insertion errors than deletion errors and the alphabet size is\nsufficiently large. Furthermore, our results reveal the existence of an insdel\ncode that can be list decoded against insdel errors beyond its minimum insdel\ndistance while still having polynomial list size. This provides a more complete\npicture on the list decodability of insdel codes when both insertion and\ndeletion errors happen. Secondly, we construct a family of explicit insdel\ncodes with efficient list decoding algorithm. As a result, we derive a\nZyablov-type bound for insdel errors. Recently, after our results appeared,\nGuruswami et al. provided a complete solution for another open problem on list\ndecoding of insdel codes. In contrast to the problems we considered, they\nprovided a region containing all possible insertion and deletion errors that\nare still list decodable by some q-ary insdel codes of non-zero rate. More\nspecifically, for a fixed number of insertion and deletion errors, while our\npaper focuses on maximizing the rate of a code that is list decodable against\nthat amount of insertion and deletion errors, Guruswami et al. focuses on\nfinding out the existence of a code with asymptotically non-zero rate which is\nlist decodable against this amount of insertion and deletion errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 03:26:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2019 03:02:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 06:45:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2019 10:46:55 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 01:59:00 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 14:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

Laurent develops a sequent-style subtyping\nsystem, without transitivity, and proves transitivity via a sequence of six\nlemmas that culminate in cut-elimination (2018). This article develops a\nsubtyping system in regular style that omits transitivity and provides a direct\nproof of transitivity, significantly reducing the length of the proof,\nexchanging the six lemmas for just one. Inspired by Laurent's system, the rule\nfor function types is essentially the $\\beta$-soundness property. The new\nsystem satisfies the \"subformula conjunction property\": every type occurring in\nthe derivation of $A <: B$ is a subformula of $A$ or $B$, or an intersection of\nsuch subformulas. The article proves that the new subtyping system is\nequivalent to that of Barendregt, Coppo, and Dezani-Ciancaglini.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 03:41:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 21:38:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

Recently, it was shown that\nthermal conductivity can be resolved exactly and in a closed form as a sum over\nrelaxons, $\\mathit{i.e.}$ collective phonon excitations that are the\neigenvectors of Boltzmann equation's scattering matrix [Cepellotti and Marzari,\nPRX $\\mathbf{6}$ (2016)].

This is because Gaussian kernel determines each\nlocal bandwidth based on one local point only, while Isolation kernel is\nderived directly from the data based on space partitioning. Second, the use of\nIsolation kernel yields a more efficient similarity computation because\ndata-dependent Isolation kernel has only one parameter that needs to be tuned.\nIn contrast, the use of data-independent Gaussian kernel increases the\ncomputational cost by determining n bandwidths for a dataset of n points. As\nthe root cause of these deficiencies in t-SNE is Gaussian kernel, we show that\nsimply replacing Gaussian kernel with Isolation kernel in t-SNE significantly\nimproves the quality of the final visualisation output (without creating\nmisrepresented structures) and removes one key obstacle that prevents t-SNE\nfrom processing large datasets.

The threshold used to train a\ndetector defines its \\textit{quality}. While the commonly used threshold of 0.5\nleads to noisy (low-quality) detections, detection performance frequently\ndegrades for larger thresholds. This paradox of high-quality detection has two\ncauses: 1) overfitting, due to vanishing positive samples for large thresholds,\nand 2) inference-time quality mismatch between detector and test hypotheses. A\nmulti-stage object detection architecture, the Cascade R-CNN, composed of a\nsequence of detectors trained with increasing IoU thresholds, is proposed to\naddress these problems. The detectors are trained sequentially, using the\noutput of a detector as training set for the next. This resampling\nprogressively improves hypotheses quality, guaranteeing a positive training set\nof equivalent size for all detectors and minimizing overfitting. The same\ncascade is applied at inference, to eliminate quality mismatches between\nhypotheses and detectors. An implementation of the Cascade R-CNN without bells\nor whistles achieves state-of-the-art performance on the COCO dataset, and\nsignificantly improves high-quality detection on generic and specific object\ndetection datasets, including VOC, KITTI, CityPerson, and WiderFace. Finally,\nthe Cascade R-CNN is generalized to instance segmentation, with nontrivial\nimprovements over the Mask R-CNN.

Hierarchical motion planning frameworks, which\ncombine path planning with path parameterization, are popular due to their time\nefficiency. However, the path planning cannot properly deal with non-static\ninitial states of the quadrotor, which may result in non-smooth or even\ndynamically infeasible trajectories. In this paper, we present an efficient\nkinodynamic replanning framework by exploiting the advantageous properties of\nthe B-spline, which facilitates dealing with the non-static state and\nguarantees safety and dynamical feasibility. Our framework starts with an\nefficient B-spline-based kinodynamic (EBK) search algorithm which finds a\nfeasible trajectory with minimum control effort and time. To compensate for the\ndiscretization induced by the EBK search, an elastic optimization (EO) approach\nis proposed to refine the control point placement to the optimal location.\nSystematic comparisons against the state-of-the-art are conducted to validate\nthe performance. Comprehensive onboard experiments using two different\nvision-based quadrotors are carried out showing the general applicability of\nthe framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 08:44:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

In\nthis paper, we explore the two most popular models proposed to explain the\nthree-minute oscillations: the chromospheric acoustic resonator and the\npropagation of waves with frequency above the cutoff value directly from lower\nlayers. We employ numerical simulations of wave propagation from the solar\ninterior to the corona. Waves are driven by a piston at the bottom boundary. We\nhave performed a parametric study of the measured chromospheric power spectra\nin a large number of numerical simulations with differences in the driving\nmethod, the height of the transition region (or absence of transition region),\nthe strength of the vertical magnetic field, and the value of the radiative\ncooling time. We find that both mechanisms require the presence of waves with\nperiod in the three-minute band at the photosphere. These waves propagate\nupward and their amplitude increases due to the drop of the density. Their\namplification is stronger than that of evanescent low-frequency waves. This\neffect is enough to explain the dominant period observed in chromospheric\nspectral lines. However, waves are partially trapped between the photosphere\nand the transition region, forming an acoustic resonator. This chromospheric\nresonant cavity strongly enhances the power in the three-minute band. The\nchromospheric acoustic resonator model and the propagation of waves in the\nthree-minute band directly from the photosphere can explain the observed\nchromospheric three-minute oscillations. They are both important in different\nscenarios. Resonances are produced by waves trapped between the temperature\nminimum and the transition region. Strong magnetic fields and radiative losses\nremove energy from the waves inside the cavity, resulting in weaker amplitude\nresonances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 09:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

Contrary to this dichotomic view, in the physical world,\nevolution and learning are complementary processes that continuously interact.\nThe recently proposed Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL) framework has\ndemonstrated mutual benefits to performance when combining the two methods.\nHowever, ERL has not fully addressed the scalability problem of GAs. In this\npaper, we show that this problem is rooted in an unfortunate combination of a\nsimple genetic encoding for DNNs and the use of traditional\nbiologically-inspired variation operators. When applied to these encodings, the\nstandard operators are destructive and cause catastrophic forgetting of the\ntraits the networks acquired. We propose a novel algorithm called Proximal\nDistilled Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (PDERL) that is characterised by\na hierarchical integration between evolution and learning. The main innovation\nof PDERL is the use of learning-based variation operators that compensate for\nthe simplicity of the genetic representation. Unlike traditional operators, our\nproposals meet the functional requirements of variation operators when applied\non directly-encoded DNNs.

For sources fainter than 16th magnitude\nthis is achieved thanks to Gaia's direct observations of quasars. At brighter\nmagnitudes it is difficult to validate the quality of the reference frame due\nto the scarcity of comparison data. This paper examines the use of VLBI\nobservations of radio stars to determine the spin and orientation of the bright\nreference frame of Gaia. Simultaneous estimation of the six spin and\norientation parameters makes optimal use of VLBI data and makes it possible to\ninclude even single-epoch VLBI observations in the solution. The method is\napplied to Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) using published VLBI data for 41 radio\nstars. Results for the 26 best-fitting sources indicate that the bright\nreference frame of Gaia DR2 is rotating relative to the faint quasars at a rate\nof about 0.1 mas/yr, significant at 2-sigma level. This supports a similar\nconclusion based on a comparison with stellar positions in the Hipparcos frame.\nThe accuracy is currently limited by the small number of radio sources used, by\nuncertainties in the Gaia DR2 proper motions, and by the astrophysical nature\nof the radio stars. While the origin of the indicated rotation is understood\nand can be avoided in future data releases, it remains important to validate\nthe bright reference frame of Gaia by independent observations. This can be\nachieved using VLBI astrometry, which may require re-observing the old sample\nof radio stars as well as measuring new objects.

In this paper a probability problem is presented whose solution\nfollows a completely reversed but systematic approach. Hence, this work is\nabout illustrating how complex probability problems could be tackled with the\nmore powerful techniques of a better studied and well understood field, that of\ndifferential equations. The problem is defined as follows: Inside a box\ncontaining r red and w white balls random removals occur. The balls are removed\nsuccessively according to the three following rules. Rule I: If a white ball is\nchosen it is immediately discarded. If a red ball is chosen, it is placed back\ninto the box and a new ball is randomly chosen. The second ball is then removed\nirrespective of the color. Rule II: Once one ball is removed, the game\ncontinues from Rule I. Rule III: The game ends once all the red balls are\nremoved. The question posed is the determination of the probability that k\nwhite balls remain where k = 0, 1, 2, ..., w. Ending the game once all the\nwhite balls are removed, a second question is the determination of the\nprobability that k red balls remain where k = 0, 1, 2, ..., r. While inductive\nsolutions are possible, the current approach demonstrates a different and\nalgorithmic route. In particular, the law of total probability yields a\nrecursion that is transformed into a linear inhomogeneous 2D PDE, with suitable\nboundary conditions. The PDE solutions, which are found analytically, provide\nthe generating functionals of the required probabilities as a function of r, w\nand k. Using the functionals, the probability formulas for any r, w and k are\nfinally obtained in a closed form. Reproducing existing results of the\nliterature this method is quite generic and adaptable to a large class of\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 10:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-27"}

In this\npaper, we use high resolution numerical simulations to investigate the impact\nof this streaming velocity on the spin and shape distributions of high-redshift\nminihalos, the formation sites of the earliest generation of stars. We find\nthat the presence of a streaming velocity has a negligible effect on the spin\nand shape of the dark matter component of the minihalos. However, it strongly\naffects the behaviour of the gas component. The most probable spin parameter\nincreases from $\\sim$0.03 in the absence of streaming to $\\sim$0.15 for a run\nwith a streaming velocity of three times $\\sigma_{\\rm rms}$, corresponding to\n1.4 km\\,s$^{-1}{}$ at redshift $z=15$. The gas within the minihalos becomes\nincreasingly less spherical and more oblate as the streaming velocity\nincreases, with dense clumps being found at larger distances from the halo\ncentre. The impact of the streaming velocity is also mass-dependent: less\nmassive objects are influenced more strongly, on account of their shallower\npotential wells. The number of halos in which gas cooling and runaway\ngravitational collapse occurs decreases substantially as the streaming velocity\nincreases. However, the spin and shape distributions of gas that does manage to\ncool and collapse are insensitive to the value of the streaming velocity and we\ntherefore do not expect the properties of the stars that formed from this\ncollapsed gas to depend on the value of the streaming velocity.

In contrast to other\nstate-of-the-art pose estimation approaches for spaceborne applications, the\nSPN method does not require the formulation of hand-engineered features and\nonly requires a single grayscale image to determine the pose of the spacecraft\nrelative to the camera. The SPN method uses a Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) with three branches to solve for the pose. The first branch of the CNN\nbootstraps a state-of-the-art object detector to detect a 2D bounding box\naround the target spacecraft. The region inside the bounding box is then used\nby the other two branches of the CNN to determine the attitude by initially\nclassifying the input region into discrete coarse attitude labels before\nregressing to a finer estimate.

In all cases the fermionic parameter of the\n$\\kappa$-symmetry is subject to two apparently different projection conditions\nwhich suggests that the ground state of the system, in particular a domain\njunction, might preserve at most 1/4 of the spacetime supersymmetry. The\nboundary term of the open supermembrane action, needed to preserve the\n$\\kappa$-symmetry, has the meaning of the action of a superstring. The\nWess--Zumino term of this superstring action is expressed in terms of real\nlinear superfield playing the role of St\\\"uckelberg field for the 3--form gauge\nsymmetry.

SiC would be\nattractive for more applications, but large-scale or large-surface area\nfabrication, with control over defects and surface is challenging. Sol-gel\nbased techniques are an affordable alternative towards such requirements. This\nreport describes two types of microcrystalline SiC derived after carbothermal\nreduction from sol-gel-based precursors, one with nitrogen added, the other\naluminum. Characterization of their bulk, structure and surface shows that\nincorporation of dopants affects the formation of polytypes and surface\nchemistry. Nitrogen leads exclusively to cubic SiC, exhibiting a native oxide\nsurface. Presence of aluminum instead promotes growth of hexagonal polytypes\nand induces self-passivation of the crystallites surface during growth. This is\nestablished by hydrogenation of silicon bonds and formation of a protecting\naluminum carbonate species. XPS provides support for the suggested mechanism.\nThis passivation is achieved in only one step, solely by aluminium in the\nprecursor. Hence, it is shown that growth, doping and passivation of SiC can be\nperformed as one-pot synthesis. Material without insulating oxide and a limited\nnumber of defects is highly valuable for applications involving\nsurface-sensitive charge-transfer reactions, therefore the potential of this\nmethod is significant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 12:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

To this end, designing an appropriate sharing mechanism is\nan issue with crucial importance and has captured great attention. This paper\naddresses the prosumers' demand response problem via energy sharing. Under a\ngeneral supply-demand function bidding scheme, a sharing market clearing\nprocedure considering network constraints is proposed, which gives rise to a\ngeneralized Nash game. The existence and uniqueness of market equilibrium are\nproved in non-congested cases.

Properties of\nthe improved sharing mechanism, including the individual rational behaviors of\nprosumers and the components of sharing price, are revealed.

Our goal is to complete the inventory of S-bearing molecules and their\nabundances in the prototypical photodissociation region (PDR) the Horsehead\nnebula to gain insight into sulphur chemistry in UV irradiated regions. Based\non the WHISPER millimeter (mm) line survey, our goal is to provide an improved\nand more accurate description of sulphur species and their abundances towards\nthe core and PDR positions in the Horsehead.\n  Methods. The Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) methodology and the molecular\nexcitation and radiative transfer code RADEX were used to explore the parameter\nspace and determine physical conditions and beam-averaged molecular abundances.\n  Results. A total of 13 S-bearing species (CS, SO, SO2, OCS, H2CS - both ortho\nand para - HDCS, C2S, HCS+, SO+, H2S, S2H, NS and NS+) have been detected in\nthe two targeted positions. This is the first detection of SO+ in the Horsehead\nand the first detection of NS+ in any PDR. We find a differentiated chemical\nbehaviour between C-S and O-S bearing species within the nebula. The C-S\nbearing species C2S and o-H2CS present fractional abundances a factor grater\nthan two higher in the core than in the PDR. In contrast, the O-S bearing\nmolecules SO, SO2, and OCS present similar abundances towards both positions. A\nfew molecules, SO+, NS, and NS+, are more abundant towards the PDR than towards\nthe core, and could be considered as PDR tracers.\n  Conclusions. This is the first complete study of S-bearing species towards a\nPDR. Our study shows that CS, SO, and H2S are the most abundant S-bearing\nmolecules in the PDR with abundances of a few 1E-9. We recall that SH, SH+, S,\nand S+ are not observable at the wavelengths covered by the WHISPER survey. At\nthe spatial scale of our observations, the total abundance of S atoms locked in\nthe detected species is < 1E-8, only ~0.1% of the cosmic sulphur abundance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 13:24:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

While lattice\nfrustration and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction are known to produce\nnon-collinear spin textures, the role of electron itinerancy in multi-q\nformation is much less studied. Here we investigated the non-collinear, helical\nspin structures in epitaxial films of the perovskite oxides SrFeO3 and CaFeO3\nusing magnetotransport and resonant soft x-ray magnetic diffraction. Metallic\nSrFeO3 exhibits features in its magnetoresistance that are consistent with its\nrecently proposed multi-q structure. Additionally, the magnetic Bragg peak of\nSrFeO3 measured at the Fe L edge resonance energy asymmetrically broadens with\ndecreasing temperature in its multi-q state. In contrast, insulating CaFeO3 has\na symmetric scattering peak with an intensity 10x weaker than SrFeO3. Enhanced\nmagnetic scattering at O K edge prepeak energies demonstrates the role of a\nnegative charge transfer energy and the resulting oxygen ligand holes in the\nmagnetic ordering of these ferrates. By measuring magnetic diffraction of\nCaFeO3/SrFeO3 superlattices with thick CaFeO3 layers, we find that the CaFeO3\nhelical ordering is coherent across 1 unit cell-thick SrFeO3 layers but not 6\nunit cell-thick layers. We conclude that insulating CaFeO3 supports only a\nsimple single-q helical structure in contrast to metallic SrFeO3 that hosts\nmulti-q structures.

Although single-graph inference is well-studied, multiple\ngraph inference is largely unexplored, in part because of the challenges\ninherent in appropriately modeling graph differences and yet retaining\nsufficient model simplicity to render estimation feasible. This paper addresses\nexactly this gap, by introducing a new model, the common subspace\nindependent-edge (COSIE) multiple random graph model, which describes a\nheterogeneous collection of networks with a shared latent structure on the\nvertices but potentially different connectivity patterns for each graph. The\nCOSIE model encompasses many popular network representations, including the\nstochastic blockmodel. The model is both flexible enough to meaningfully\naccount for important graph differences and tractable enough to allow for\naccurate inference in multiple networks. In particular, a joint spectral\nembedding of adjacency matrices - the multiple adjacency spectral embedding\n(MASE) - leads, in a COSIE model, to simultaneous consistent estimation of\nunderlying parameters for each graph. Under mild additional assumptions, MASE\nestimates satisfy asymptotic normality and yield improvements for graph\neigenvalue estimation and hypothesis testing. In both simulated and real data,\nthe COSIE model and the MASE embedding can be deployed for a number of\nsubsequent network inference tasks, including dimensionality reduction,\nclassification, hypothesis testing and community detection. Specifically, when\nMASE is applied to a dataset of connectomes constructed through diffusion\nmagnetic resonance imaging, the result is an accurate classification of brain\nscans by patient and a meaningful determination of heterogeneity across scans\nof different subjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 15:29:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 21:24:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 06:21:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 05:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

Our\nwork points out a novel path towards the creation of exotic superfluid states\nby exploiting the competition between long-range and short-range interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 15:51:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

While some\nlanguages, e.g., English, have a vast array of these resources, most\nunder-resourced languages do not, especially for fine-grained sentiment tasks,\nsuch as aspect-level or targeted sentiment analysis. To improve this situation,\nwe propose a cross-lingual approach to sentiment analysis that is applicable to\nunder-resourced languages and takes into account target-level information. This\nmodel incorporates sentiment information into bilingual distributional\nrepresentations, by jointly optimizing them for semantics and sentiment,\nshowing state-of-the-art performance at sentence-level when combined with\nmachine translation. The adaptation to targeted sentiment analysis on multiple\ndomains shows that our model outperforms other projection-based bilingual\nembedding methods on binary targeted sentiment tasks. Our analysis on ten\nlanguages demonstrates that the amount of unlabeled monolingual data has\nsurprisingly little effect on the sentiment results. As expected, the choice of\nannotated source language for projection to a target leads to better results\nfor source-target language pairs which are similar. Therefore, our results\nsuggest that more efforts should be spent on the creation of resources for less\nsimilar languages to those which are resource-rich already. Finally, a domain\nmismatch leads to a decreased performance.

To this end, we propose a common\nfeature learning scheme, in which the features of all teachers are transformed\ninto a common space and the student is enforced to imitate them all so as to\namalgamate the intact knowledge. We test the proposed approach on a list of\nbenchmarks and demonstrate that the learned student is able to achieve very\npromising performance, superior to those of the teachers in their specialized\ntasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 12:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

Today, semi-empirical tools are used by the\nindustry to predict VIV induced fatigue on risers. The load model and\nhydrodynamic parameters in present VIV prediction tools are developed based on\ntwo-dimensional (2D) flow conditions, as it is challenging to consider the\neffect of 3D flow along the risers. Accordingly, the current profiles must be\npurposely made 2D during the design process, which leads to significant\nuncertainty in the prediction results. Further, due to the limitations in the\nlaboratory, VIV model tests are mostly carried out under 2D flow conditions and\nthus little experimental data exist to document VIV response of riser subjected\nto varying directions of the current. However, a few experiments have been\nconducted with 3D current.

The framework proposed\nherein exploits the time series prediction capability of long short-term memory\n(LSTM) recurrent neural network such that: (i) in the training phase, the LSTM\nmodel is trained on the modal coefficients extracted from the high-resolution\ndata using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) transform, and (ii) in the\ntesting phase, the trained model predicts the modal coefficients for the total\ntime recursively based on the initial time history. To illustrate the\npredictive performance of the proposed framework, the mean flow fields and time\nseries response of the field values are reconstructed from the predicted modal\ncoefficients by using an inverse POD transform. As a representative benchmark\ntest case, we consider a two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic (QG) ocean\ncirculation model which, in general, displays an enormous range of fluctuating\nspatial and temporal scales. We first illustrate that the conventional Galerkin\nprojection based ROM of such systems requires a high number of POD modes to\nobtain a stable flow physics. In addition, ROM-GP does not seem to capture the\nintermittent bursts appearing in the dynamics of the first few most energetic\nmodes.

Inhomogeneities can\noccur at various steps of device preparation and appear in all layers with\ndifferent length scales and impact. The hole-transport interlayer (HTL) in OPV\ndevices blocks unwanted electron diffusion to the anode and corrects energetic\nmismatch between oxide electrode and organic semiconductor.

The improvement of device efficiency due to incorporation of\na hole-transport layer (HTL) in bulk-heterojunction solar cells has been\nextensively reported. However, the most widely used HTL material, PEDOT:PSS is\nfrequently suspected to be the dominating source for devices instability under\nenvironmental conditions. Thereby effects like photooxidation and electrode\ncorrosion are often reported to shorten device lifetime. However, often in\nenvironmental device studies, the source of degradation, whether being from the\nHTL, the active layer or the metal cathode are rather difficult to distinguish,\nbecause the external diffusion of oxygen and water affects all components. In\nthis study, different HTLs, namely prepared from traditional PEDOT:PSS and also\ntwo types of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3), are exposed to different environments\nsuch as oxygen, light or humidity, prior to device finalization under inert\nconditions.

The results\nshow that merely humidity-exposure of the HTL leads to decreased device\nperformance for PEDOT:PSS, but also for one type of the tested MoO3. The losses\nare related to the amount of absorbed water in the HTL, inducing loss of active\narea in terms of interfacial contact.
