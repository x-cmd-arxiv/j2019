For the auditory\ncontent, a minimalistic set of parameters such as prosodic, excitation, vocal\ntract, and spectral descriptors are used as features. The fusion of these two\nmodalities is carried out at a feature level, before training a single support\nvector regressor (SVR) or at a prediction level, after training one SVR for\neach modality. The proposed approach also includes preprocessing and\npost-processing techniques which contribute favorably to improving the\nconcordance correlation coefficient (CCC).

We solve\nthis model by dynamical mean-field theory within the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation. Consistently with the first-order character of the\nmetal-insulator transition, the Born-Oppenheimer potential has a rich\nlandscape, with minima corresponding to the undistorted phase and to the four\nequivalent distorted ones, and which translates into an equally rich\nthermodynamics that we uncover by the Monte Carlo method.

However, the meta-policy must still produce appropriate\ndecisions in all states. In this work, we propose a policy design that\ndecomposes into primitives, similarly to hierarchical reinforcement learning,\nbut without a high-level meta-policy. Instead, each primitive can decide for\nthemselves whether they wish to act in the current state. We use an\ninformation-theoretic mechanism for enabling this decentralized decision: each\nprimitive chooses how much information it needs about the current state to make\na decision and the primitive that requests the most information about the\ncurrent state acts in the world. The primitives are regularized to use as\nlittle information as possible, which leads to natural competition and\nspecialization. We experimentally demonstrate that this policy architecture\nimproves over both flat and hierarchical policies in terms of generalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2019 17:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

No additional stellar or planetary signals are\nseen in the data.

While the framework\nhas been generalized in a variety of different ways to the quantum case, much\nof this work leaves open whether causal concepts are fundamental to quantum\ntheory, or only find application at an emergent level of classical devices and\nmeasurement outcomes. Here, we present a framework of quantum causal models,\nwith causal relations defined in terms intrinsic to quantum theory, and the\ncentral object of study being the quantum process itself. Following Allen et\nal., Phys. Rev. X 7, 031021 (2017), the approach defines quantum causal\nrelations in terms of unitary evolution, in a way analogous to an approach to\nclassical causal models that assumes underlying determinism and situates causal\nrelations in functional dependences between variables. We show that any unitary\nquantum circuit has a causal structure corresponding to a directed acyclic\ngraph, and that when marginalising over local noise sources, the resulting\nquantum process satisfies a Markov condition with respect to the graph. We also\nprove a converse to this statement. We introduce an intrinsically quantum\nnotion that plays a role analogous to the conditional independence of classical\nvariables, and (generalizing a central theorem of the classical framework) show\nthat d-separation is sound and complete for it in the quantum case. We present\ngeneralizations of the three rules of the classical do-calculus, in each case\nrelating a property of the causal structure to a formal property of the quantum\nprocess, and to an operational statement concerning the outcomes of\ninterventions. In addition, we introduce and derive similar results for\nclassical split-node causal models, which are more closely analogous to quantum\ncausal models than the classical causal models that are usually studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2019 19:02:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 17:06:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-23"}

Given oracle access\nto an algorithm for an underlying optimization problem, the goal is to simulate\nan incentive compatible mechanism. The mechanism will be evaluated on its\nexpected welfare, relative to the algorithm provided, and its complexity is\nmeasured by the time (and queries) needed to simulate the mechanism on any\ninput. While it is known that black-box reductions are not possible in many\nprior-free settings, settings with priors appear more promising: there are\nknown reductions for Bayesian incentive compatible (BIC) mechanism design for\ngeneral classes of welfare maximization problems. This dichotomy begs the\nquestion: which mechanism design problems admit black-box reductions, and which\ndo not?\n  Our main result is that black-box mechanism design is impossible under two of\nthe simplest settings not captured by known positive results. First, for the\nproblem of allocating $n$ goods to a single buyer whose valuation is additive\nand independent across the goods, subject to a downward-closed constraint on\nfeasible allocations, we show that there is no polytime (in $n$) BIC black-box\nreduction for expected welfare maximization. Second, for the setting of\nmultiple single-parameter agents---where polytime BIC reductions are known---we\nshow that no polytime reductions exist when the incentive requirement is\ntightened to Max-In-Distributional-Range. In each case, we show that achieving\na sub-polynomial approximation to the expected welfare requires exponentially\nmany queries, even when the set of feasible allocations is known to be\ndownward-closed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 00:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-27"}

The Black Hole Accretion Code (BHAC) intends to aid with the modelling\nof such sources by means of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD)\nsimulations in arbitrary stationary spacetimes. New additions were required to\nguarantee an accurate evolution of the magnetic field when small and large\nscales are captured simultaneously. We discuss the adaptive mesh refinement\n(AMR) techniques employed in BHAC, essential to keep several problems\ncomputationally tractable, as well as staggered-mesh-based constrained\ntransport (CT) algorithms to preserve the divergence-free constraint of the\nmagnetic field, including a general class of prolongation operators for\nface-allocated variables compatible with them.

A new concept, termed as accessible capacity, is introduced to\nspecify the maximum rate at which the superposition transmission of extra bits\nis reliable and has a negligible effect on the performance of the coded payload\nlink. For a binary-input output-symmetric (BIOS) memoryless channel, the\naccessible capacity can be characterized as the difference between the channel\ncapacity and the mutual information rate of the coded payload link, which can\nbe numerically evaluated for very short payload codes. For a general payload\ncode, we present a simple lower bound on the accessible capacity, given by the\nchannel capacity minus the coding rate of the payload code. We then focus on\nthe scenarios where low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are implemented for\nthe payload link. We propose to transmit extra bits by random superposition for\nencoding, and exhaustive search (with the aid of statistical learning) for\ndecoding.

Successful\nstate inference of RNA sequences can be used to generate auxiliary information\nfor data-directed RNA secondary structure prediction. Bidirectional long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool that\ncan model global nonlinear sequence dependencies and have achieved\nstate-of-the-art performances on many different classification problems. This\npaper presents a practical approach to RNA secondary structure inference\ncentered around a deep learning method for state inference. State predictions\nfrom a deep bidirectional LSTM are used to generate synthetic SHAPE data that\ncan be incorporated into RNA secondary structure prediction via the Nearest\nNeighbor Thermodynamic Model (NNTM).

This metric geometry is generalized here to Lie geometry meaning\nan open cover by special coordinate charts in a model space whose transition\nmappings are related by one of several finite dimensional Lie groups acting on\nthe model space. The Lie group is allowed to vary in a constrained manner from\nregion to region in the manifold. Our geometric version of torus wall crossing\nafter fixing finitely many parameters is rigid using covering spaces, pushouts,\nand sliding flat toroidal cylinders rigidly together. A new concept, Lie\ngenerated geometry, describes abstractly what these constructions produce.\nThese Lie generated geometries are determined by special coordinate chart\ncoverings as suggested above, but structurally they consist of sheaves of germs\nof charts into the upper half space which are related by four Lie groups acting\nthere.

To overcome this difficulty, we propose gradient\nnoise convolution (GNC), which effectively smooths sharper minima of the loss\nfunction. For DP-SGD, GNC utilizes so-called gradient noise, which is induced\nby stochastic gradient variation and convolved to the loss function as a\nsmoothing effect. GNC computation can be performed by simply computing the\nstochastic gradient on each parallel worker and merging them, and is therefore\nextremely easy to implement.

Both disc galaxies have halos of\ndark matter, central bulges and initial supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds at\ntheir centers. The purpose of this work is to study the mass and dynamical\nevolution of the initial SMBH seed during a Hubble cosmological time. It is a\ncomplementation of our previous paper with different initial orbit conditions\nand by introducing the SMBH seed in the initial galaxy. The disc of the\nsecondary galaxy has coplanar or polar orientation in relation to the disc of\nthe primary galaxy and their initial orbit are eccentric and prograde. The\nprimary and secondary galaxies have mass and size of Milky Way with an initial\nSMBH seed. We have found that the merger of the primary and secondary discs can\nresult in a final normal disc or a final warped disc. After the fusion of\ndiscs, the final one is thicker and larger than the initial disc. The tidal\neffects are very important, modifying the evolution of the SMBH in the primary\nand secondary galaxy differently. The mass of the SMBH of the primary galaxy\nhave increased by a factor ranging from 52 to 64 times the initial seed mass,\ndepending on the experiment. However, the mass of the SMBH of the secondary\ngalaxy have increased by a factor ranging from 6 to 33 times the initial SMBH\nseed mass, depending also on the experiment. Most of the accreted particles\nhave come from the bulge and from the halo, depleting their particles. This\ncould explain why the observations show that the SMBH with masses of\napproximately $10^6 M_\\odot$ are found in many bulgeless galaxies.

In this paper, UNet is utilized to extract\ninter-frame and intra-frame spatio-temporal information of cells. Detection\nperformance of cells in mitotic phase is improved by multi-frame input. Good\ndetection results facilitate multi-cell tracking. A mitosis detection algorithm\nis proposed to detect cell mitosis and the cell lineage is built up. Another\nUNet is utilized to acquire primary segmentation. Jointly using detection and\nprimary segmentation, cells can be fine segmented in highly dense cell\npopulation. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our\nmethod, and results show its state-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 07:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-27"}

At\neach point convolution layer, features are computed from local neighborhoods of\n3D points and combined for subsequent processing in order to extract semantic\ninformation. Existing methods adopt the same individual point neighborhoods\nthroughout the network layers, defined by the same metric on the fixed input\npoint coordinates. This common practice is easy to implement but not\nnecessarily optimal. Ideally, local neighborhoods should be different at\ndifferent layers, as more latent information is extracted at deeper layers. We\npropose a novel end-to-end approach to learn different non-rigid\ntransformations of the input point cloud so that optimal local neighborhoods\ncan be adopted at each layer.

However, the Alfv\\'enic wave energy estimated from the Doppler\nvelocity measurements in the corona was found to be four orders of magnitude\nless than that estimated from non-thermal line widths. McIntosh & De Pontieu\n(2012) suggested that this discrepancy in energy might be due to the\nline-of-sight (LOS) superposition of the several oscillating structures, which\ncan lead to an underestimation of the Alfv\\'enic wave amplitudes and energies.\nMcIntosh & De Pontieu (2012) termed this coronal `dark' or `hidden' energy.\nHowever, their simulations required the use of an additional, unknown source of\nAlfv\\'enic wave energy to provide agreement with measurements of the coronal\nnon-thermal line widths. In this study, we investigate the requirement of this\nunknown source of additional `dark' energy in the solar corona using\ngravitationally stratified 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of\npropagating waves. We excite the transverse MHD waves and generate synthetic\nobservations for the Fe XIII emission line. We establish that the LOS\nsuperposition greatly reduces the Doppler velocity amplitudes and increases the\nnon-thermal line widths. Importantly, our model generates the observed\nwedge-shaped correlation between Doppler velocities and non-thermal line\nwidths.

The vast majority of studies for selecting a countermeasure\ndeployment are based on a limited risk assessment procedure that utilizes the\ncommon vulnerability scoring system (CVSS). Such a risk assessment procedure\ndoes not necessarily consider the prerequisites and exploitability of a\nspecific asset, cannot distinguish insider from outsider threat actor, and does\nnot express the consequences of exploiting a vulnerability as well as the\nattacker's lateral movements. Other studies applied a more extensive risk\nassessment procedure that relies on manual work and repeated assessment. These\nsolutions however, do not consider the network topology and do not specify the\noptimal position for deploying the countermeasures, and therefore are less\npractical. In this paper we suggest a heuristic search approach for selecting\nthe optimal countermeasure deployment under a given budget limitation. The\nproposed method expresses the risk of the system using an extended attack graph\nmodeling, which considers the prerequisites and consequences of exploiting a\nvulnerability, examines the attacker's potential lateral movements, and express\nthe physical network topology as well as vulnerabilities in network protocols.\nIn addition, unlike previous studies which utilizes attack graph for\ncountermeasure planning, the proposed methods does not require re-generating\nthe attack graph at each stage of the procedure, which is computationally\nheavy, and therefore it provides a more accurate and practical countermeasure\ndeployment planning process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 09:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-27"}

Current advanced methods for detecting events are primarily\nfocused on identifying with high accuracy the beginning of the AE wave;\nhowever, the detection of the conclusion has been disregarded in the\nliterature. For an automatic continuous detection of events within a data\nstream, this lack of accuracy for the conclusion of the events generates errors\nin two critical aspects. In one hand, it deteriorates the accuracy of the\nmeasurement of the events duration, truncating the span of the event\n(undesirable in evaluation applications), and in the other hand, it causes\nfalse detections. In this work, an accurate and computationally efficient AE\nactivity detector is presented, using a framework inspired by the area of\nspeech processing, and which provides the required indicators to accurately\ndetect the onset and the end of an AE event. This is achieved by means of a\nthreshold approach that instead of directly operates with the transduced\nvoltage signal it does so over the Short-Term Energy and the Short-Term\nZero-Crossing Rate measures of the signal. The STE-ZCR method is developed for\nan application related to the continuous monitoring of a single AE channel\nderived from the characterization of metallic components by means of a uniaxial\ntensile test. Additionally, two experimental test-benches are implemented with\nthe aim to quantify the accuracy and the quality of event detection of the\npresented method. Finally, the obtained results are compared with four\ndifferent techniques, representing the current state of the art related to AE\nactivity detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 10:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-31"}

As a\nrepresentative implementation of GNNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are\nsuccessfully applied in a variety of tasks on real datasets.

One of the main bottlenecks for efficient electronic cooling is\nthe electron-phonon coupling, as it represents a thermal leakage channel to the\nphonon bath. Graphene is a two-dimensional material that exhibits a weaker\nelectron-phonon coupling compared to standard metals.

We show that, by properly\nbiasing the graphene, its electronic temperature can reach base values lower\nthan those achieved in similar systems based on metallic ultra-thin films.\nMoreover, the lower electron-phonon coupling is mirrored in a lower heat power\npumped into the superconducting leads, thus avoiding their overheating and\npreserving the cooling mechanisms.

Though MSCs have been of increasing interest, understanding the\nreaction pathways toward their nucleation and stabilization is an outstanding\nissue. In this work, we demonstrate that high concentration synthesis (1000 mM)\npromotes a well-defined reaction pathway to form high-purity MSCs (greater than\n99.9 percent). The MSCs are resistant to typical growth and dissolution\nprocesses. Based on insights from in-situ X-ray scattering analysis, we\nattribute this stability to the accompanying production of a large, hexagonal\norganic-inorganic mesophase (greater than 100 nm grain size) that arrests\ngrowth of the MSCs and prevents NP growth. At intermediate concentrations (500\nmM), the MSC mesophase forms, but is unstable, resulting in NP growth at the\nexpense of the assemblies. These results provide an alternate explanation for\nthe high stability of MSCs. Whereas the conventional mantra has been that the\nstability of MSCs derives from the precise arrangement of the inorganic\nstructures (i.e., closed-shell atomic packing), we demonstrate that anisotropic\nclusters can also be stabilized by self-forming fibrous mesophase assemblies.\nAt lower concentration (less than 200 mM or greater than 16 acid-to-metal),\nMSCs are further destabilized and NPs formation dominates that of MSCs.\nOverall, the high concentration approach intensifies and showcases inherent\nconcentration-dependent surfactant phase behavior that is not accessible in\nconventional (i.e., dilute) conditions. This work provides not only a robust\nmethod to synthesize, stabilize, and study identical MSC products, but also\nuncovers an underappreciated stabilizing interaction between surfactants and\nclusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 11:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-27"}

The strings produced by either of these algorithms are\nconstructed by concatenating non-sensitive parts of the input string. However,\nit is possible to detect the sensitive patterns by ``reversing'' the\nconcatenation operations. In response, we propose a heuristic, MCSR-ALGO, which\nreplaces letters in the strings output by the algorithms with carefully\nselected letters, so that sensitive patterns are not reinstated, implausible\npatterns are not introduced, and occurrences of spurious patterns are\nprevented. In the second setting, we aim to generate a string that is at\nminimal edit distance from the original string, in addition to preserving the\norder of appearance and frequency of all non-sensitive patterns. To construct\nsuch a string, we propose an algorithm, ETFS-ALGO, based on solving specific\ninstances of approximate regular expression matching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 12:34:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Dec 2019 13:33:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

However, modern segmentation algorithms output a\nprobability or confidence map with continuous values in the zero-to-one\ninterval. Moreover, these binary overlapping measures are biased to structure\nsize. Addressing these challenges is the objective of this work. Methods: We\nextend the definition of the classical Dice coefficient (DC) overlap to\nfacilitate the direct comparison of a ground truth binary image with a\nprobabilistic map. We call the extended method continuous Dice coefficient\n(cDC) and show that 1) cDC is less or equal to 1 and cDC = 1 if-and-only-if the\nstructures overlap is complete, and, 2) cDC is monotonically decreasing with\nthe amount of overlap. We compare the classical DC and the cDC in a simulation\nof partial volume effects that incorporates segmentations of common targets for\ndeep-brainstimulation. Lastly, we investigate the cDC for an automatic\nsegmentation of the subthalamic-nucleus. Results: Partial volume effect\nsimulation on thalamus (large structure) resulted with DC and cDC averages (SD)\nof 0.98 (0.006) and 0.99 (0.001), respectively. For subthalamic-nucleus (small\nstructure) DC and cDC were 0.86 (0.025) and 0.97 (0.006), respectively. The DC\nand cDC for automatic STN segmentation were 0.66 and 0.80, respectively.\nConclusion: The cDC is well defined for probabilistic segmentation, less biased\nto structure size and more robust to partial volume effects in comparison to\nDC. Significance: The proposed method facilitates a better evaluation of\nsegmentation algorithms. As a better measurement tool, it opens the door for\nthe development of better segmentation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 12:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-27"}

Transmission over these channels has been originally studied with the\ngoal of recovering the sent message, and more recently with the goal of\ndetecting tampering with the sent messages. In this paper we introduce\nnon-malleability as the protection goal of message transmission over these\nchannels, and study binary (discrete memoryless) AVCs where possible tampering\nis modelled by the set of channel states. Our main result is that\nnon-malleability for these channels is achievable at a rate asymptotically\napproaching 1. We also consider the setting of an AVC with a special state s*,\nand the additional requirement that the message must be recoverable if s* is\napplied to all the transmitted bits. We give the outline of a message encoding\nscheme that in addition to non-malleability, can provide recovery for all s*\nchannel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 13:03:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 08:17:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-04"}

However, this assumption does not hold in many diverse\nscientific fields, such as astronomy, finance, and climatology, among others.\nThere are some techniques that fit unequally spaced time series, such as the\ncontinuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) processes. These models\nare defined as the solution of a stochastic differential equation. It is not\nuncommon in astronomical time series, that the time gaps between observations\nare large. Therefore, an alternative suitable approach to modeling astronomical\ntime series with large gaps between observations should be based on the\nsolution of a difference equation of a discrete process. In this work we\npropose a novel model to fit irregular time series called the complex irregular\nautoregressive (CIAR) model that is represented directly as a discrete-time\nprocess. We show that the model is weakly stationary and that it can be\nrepresented as a state-space system, allowing efficient maximum likelihood\nestimation based on the Kalman recursions. Furthermore, we show via Monte Carlo\nsimulations that the finite sample performance of the parameter estimation is\naccurate. The proposed methodology is applied to light curves from periodic\nvariable stars, illustrating how the model can be implemented to detect poor\nadjustment of the harmonic model. This can occur when the period has not been\naccurately estimated or when the variable stars are multiperiodic. Last, we\nshow how the CIAR model, through its state space representation, allows\nunobserved measurements to be forecast.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 15:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

These schemes may be\nstaggered or colocated, using either struc-tured meshes or general simplicial\nor tetrahedral/hexahedral meshes. The time discretization is performed by\nfractional-step algorithms; these may be either based on semi-implicit pressure\ncorrection techniques or segregated in such a way that only explicit steps are\ninvolved (referred to hereafter as \"explicit\" variants). In order to ensure the\npositivity of the density, the internal energy and the pressure, the discrete\nconvection operators for the mass and internal energy balance equations are\ncarefully designed; they use an upwind technique with respect to the material\nvelocity only. The construction of the fluxes thus does not need any Rie-mann\nor approximate Riemann solver, and yields easily implementable algorithms. The\nstability is obtained without restriction on the time step for the pressure\ncorrection scheme and under a CFL-like condition for explicit variants:\npreservation of the integral of the total energy over the computational domain,\nand positivity of the density and the internal energy. The semi-implicit\nfirst-order upwind scheme satisfies a local discrete entropy inequality. If a\nMUSCL-like scheme is used in order to limit the scheme diffusion, then a weaker\nproperty holds: the entropy inequality is satisfied up to a remainder term\nwhich is shown to tend to zero with the space and time steps, if the discrete\nsolution is controlled in L $\\infty$ and BV norms. The explicit upwind variant\nalso satisfies such a weaker property, at the price of an estimate for the\nvelocity which could be derived from the introduction of a new stabilization\nterm in the momentum balance. Still for the explicit scheme, with the\nabove-mentioned MUSCL-like scheme, the same result only holds if the ratio of\nthe time to the space step tends to zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 11:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-28"}

Here we propose an agent-based game-theoretical model\nfor these conflicts, where agents may decide to resort to A.I. to use and\nacquire additional information on the payoffs of a stochastic game, striving to\nbring insights from simulation to what has been, hitherto, a mostly\nphilosophical discussion.

Nevertheless, we show that it is possible\nto develop A.I. systems following human conscious policies that, when\nintroduced in society, lead to an equilibrium where the gains for the adopters\nare not at a cost for non-adopters, thus increasing the overall wealth of the\npopulation and lowering inequality.
