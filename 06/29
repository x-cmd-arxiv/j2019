We show that in waveguide QED, the problem of\nphoton counting can be reduced to atom counting, by entangling the photonic\nstate with an atomic array in the collective number basis.

Despite the recent\nsuccess of deep learning models in discriminative tasks of point clouds,\ngenerating point clouds remains challenging. This paper proposes a principled\nprobabilistic framework to generate 3D point clouds by modeling them as a\ndistribution of distributions. Specifically, we learn a two-level hierarchy of\ndistributions where the first level is the distribution of shapes and the\nsecond level is the distribution of points given a shape. This formulation\nallows us to both sample shapes and sample an arbitrary number of points from a\nshape. Our generative model, named PointFlow, learns each level of the\ndistribution with a continuous normalizing flow. The invertibility of\nnormalizing flows enables the computation of the likelihood during training and\nallows us to train our model in the variational inference framework.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate that PointFlow achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in point cloud generation.

In the absence of such a screening, the same\neffect must modify electromagnetic luminosity distances inferred from\nsupernovae Type Ia, to the extent that the effects can cancel in the\ncomparison.

The Robins use a unique method to determine the migratory direction.\nIn the procedure utilized, the important issue is the effect of the geomagnetic\nfield on the magnetic momentum of created radical pairs (triplet-singlet\nstates) dancing with a special frequency. To duplicate the same operational\nprocedure, the quantum sensor consisting of two coincident tripartite systems\nis designed. Each system is separately excited with the entangled photons\n(signal and idler) produced through nonlinearity. In a traditional tripartite\nsystem, the microwave cavity mode can be non-classically correlated with the\noptical cavity mode. In this study, however, there are two microwave cavities\nmodes separately affected by the entangled photons, and these modes can be\nentangled. The entangled microwave photons play the same role that the\ntriplet-singlet state of the electrons have in the Robins operating system. It\nis the key point that the quantum sensor is deigned to work with, in such a way\nthat the entangled microwave photons can be strongly affected by the applied\nexternal magnetic field. In fact, it is the criterion employed by the quantum\nsensor to sense the magnetic field intensity and the direction.

Several studies have highlighted the relationship between the\nangular coordinates of the nodes embedded in the hyperbolic space and the\ncommunity metadata available.

The result\nis a flexible modeling approach that can be used for data exploration in a\nlarge variety of problems. We demonstrate its use with applications from\ndifferent disciplines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 18:33:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-19"}

Our updated\ncensus of Taurus now contains 519 known members. According to Gaia data, this\ncensus should be nearly complete for spectral types earlier than M6-M7 at\nA_J<1. For a large field encompassing ~72% of the known members, the census\nshould be complete for K<15.7 at A_J<1.5, which corresponds to ~5-13 M_Jup for\nages of 1-10 Myr based on theoretical evolutionary models. Our survey has\ndoubled the number of known members at greater or equal to M9 and has uncovered\nthe faintest known member in M_K, which should have a mass of ~3-10 M_Jup for\nages of 1-10 Myr. We have used mid-IR photometry from the Spitzer Space\nTelescope and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer to determine whether the\nnew members exhibit excess emission that would indicate the presence of\ncircumstellar disks. The updated disk fraction for Taurus is ~0.7 at less than\nor equal to M3.5 and ~0.4 at >M3.5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 19:46:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

Moreover, the anatomical\nvariability encoded by this discriminative latent space can be visualised in\nthe segmentation space thanks to the generative properties of the model, making\nthe classification task transparent.

This approach is in stark contrast to modern methods for\nbrowser-based interactive visualization, which feature high-level declarative\nspecifications. In response, we present DIEL, a declarative framework that\nsupports asynchronous events over distributed data.

Ideally,\nthe transformation that registers one image to another should be a\ndiffeomorphism that is both invertible and smooth. Traditional methods like\ngeodesic shooting approach the problem via differential geometry, with\ntheoretical guarantees that the resulting transformation will be smooth and\ninvertible. Most previous research using unsupervised deep neural networks for\nregistration have used a local smoothness constraint (typically, a spatial\nvariation loss) to address the smoothness issue. These networks usually produce\nnon-invertible transformations with ``folding'' in multiple voxel locations,\nindicated by a negative determinant of the Jacobian matrix of the\ntransformation. While using a loss function that specifically penalizes the\nfolding is a straightforward solution, this usually requires carefully tuning\nthe regularization strength, especially when there are also other losses. In\nthis paper we address this problem from a different angle, by investigating\npossible training mechanisms that will help the network avoid negative\nJacobians and produce smoother deformations.

As small systems are solved\nin real-time by phcpy, they are suitable for interactive exploration through\nthe notebook interface. Meanwhile, phcpy supports GPU parallelization,\nimproving the speed and quality of solutions to much larger polynomial systems.\nFrom various model design and analysis problems in STEM, certain classes of\npolynomial system frequently arise, to which phcpy is well-suited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 22:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

To close this gap, we studied the\nperformance of parallel trajectory analysis with MPI and the Python MDAnalysis\nlibrary on three different XSEDE supercomputers where trajectories were read\nfrom a Lustre parallel file system. Strong scaling performance was impeded by\nstragglers, MPI processes that were slower than the typical process.

However, a more complicated picture emerged in\nwhich both the computation and the data ingestion exhibited close to ideal\nstrong scaling behavior whereas stragglers were primarily caused by either\nlarge MPI communication costs or long times to open the single shared\ntrajectory file. We improved overall strong scaling performance by either\nsubfiling (splitting the trajectory into separate files) or MPI-IO with\nParallel HDF5 trajectory files.

In\nearly studies the drag coefficient $B$ was computed and experimentally\ndetermined only for dislocation velocities $v$ much less than transverse sound\nspeed, $c_t$. In this paper we derive analytic expressions for the velocity\ndependence of $B$ up to $c_t$ in terms of the third-order continuum elastic\nconstants of an isotropic crystal, in the continuum Debye approximation, valid\nfor dislocation velocities approaching the sound speed. In so doing we point\nout that the most general form of the third order elastic potential for such a\ncrystal and the dislocation-phonon interaction requires two additional elastic\nconstants involving asymmetric local rotational strains, which have been\nneglected previously. We compute the velocity dependence of the transverse\nphonon wind contribution to $B$ in the range 1%-90% $c_t$ for Al, Cu, Fe, and\nNb in the isotropic Debye approximation. The drag coefficient for transverse\nphonons scattering from screw dislocations is finite as $v \\rightarrow c_t$,\nwhereas $B$ is divergent for transverse phonons scattering from edge\ndislocations in the same limit. This divergence indicates the breakdown of the\nDebye approximation and sensitivity of the drag coefficient at very high\nvelocities to the microscopic crystalline lattice cutoff. We compare our\nresults to experimental results wherever possible and identify ways to validate\nand further improve the theory of dislocation drag at high velocities with\nrealistic phonon dispersion relations, inclusion of lattice cutoff effects, MD\nsimulation data, and more accurate experimental measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 22:29:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 22:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

The Galactic population of white dwarfs conveys a wealth\nof information about several fundamental issues and are of vital importance to\nstudy the structure, evolution and chemical enrichment of our Galaxy and its\ncomponents ---including the star formation history of the Milky Way. In\naddition, white dwarfs are tracers of the evolution of planetary systems along\nseveral phases of stellar evolution. Also, white dwarfs are used as\nlaboratories for astro-particle physics, being their interest focused on\nphysics beyond the standard model. The last decade has witnessed a great\nprogress in the study of white dwarfs. In particular, a wealth of information\nof these stars from different surveys has allowed us to make meaningful\ncomparison of evolutionary models with observations. While some information\nlike surface chemical composition, temperature and gravity of isolated white\ndwarfs can be inferred from spectroscopy, and the total mass and radius can be\nderived as well when they are in binaries, the internal structure of these\ncompact stars can be unveiled only by means of asteroseismology, an approach\nbased on the comparison between the observed pulsation periods of variable\nstars and the periods predicted by appropriate theoretical models. The\nasteroseismological techniques allow us to infer details of the internal\nchemical stratification, the total mass, and even the stellar rotation profile.\nIn this review, we first revise the evolutionary channels currently accepted\nthat lead to the formation of white-dwarf stars, and then, we give a detailed\naccount of the different sub-types of pulsating white dwarfs known so far,\nemphasizing the recent observational and theoretical advancements in the study\nof these fascinating variable stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 23:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

Most of the papers on this topic mainly focus on minimizing\ntotal disagreement, a global objective for this problem. In this paper, we\nstudy a cluster-wise objective function that asks to minimize the maximum\nnumber of disagreements of each cluster, which we call min-max correlation\nclustering.

That's why the recommender systems\nresearch community has advocated some \"beyond accuracy\" evaluation metrics such\nas novelty, diversity, coverage, and serendipity with the hope of promoting\ninformation discovery and sustain users' interest over a long period of time.\nWhile bringing in new perspectives, most of these evaluation metrics have not\nconsidered individual users' difference: an open-minded user may favor highly\nnovel or diversified recommendations whereas a conservative user's appetite for\nnovelty or diversity may not be that large. In this paper, we developed a model\nto approximate an individual's curiosity distribution over different levels of\nstimuli guided by the well-known Wundt curve in Psychology. We measured an\nitem's surprise level to assess the stimulation level and whether it is in the\nrange of the user's appetite for stimulus. We then proposed a recommendation\nsystem framework that considers both user preference and appetite for stimulus\nwhere the curiosity is maximally aroused. Our framework differs from a typical\nrecommender system in that it leverages human's curiosity to promote intrinsic\ninterest with the system. A series of evaluation experiments have been\nconducted to show that our framework is able to rank higher the items with not\nonly high ratings but also high response likelihood.

The interaction of the stellar wind and radiation with gas and\ndust in the interstellar medium produces curved arcs of emission at optical,\ninfrared, and radio wavelengths. We recently proposed a new two-dimensional\nclassification scheme for the shape of such bow shocks, which we here apply to\nthree very different observational datasets: mid-infrared arcs around hot OB\nstars; far-infrared arcs around luminous cool stars; and H alpha emission-line\narcs around proplyds and other young stars in the Orion Nebula. For OB stars,\nthe average shape is consistent with simple thin-shell models for the\ninteraction of a spherical wind with a parallel stream, but the diversity of\nobserved shapes is many times larger than such models predict. We propose that\nthis may be caused by time-dependent oscillations in the bow shocks, due to\neither instabilities or wind variability. Cool star bow shocks have markedly\nmore closed wings than hot star bow shocks, which may be due to the dust\nemission arising in the shocked stellar wind instead of the shocked\ninterstellar medium. The Orion Nebula arcs, on the other hand, have both\nsignificantly more open wings and significantly flatter apexes than the hot\nstar bow shocks.

The challenges of past work can be overcome by relying on a\ndeeper understanding of realistic home automation usage. More specifically, the\navailability of natural home automation scenarios, i.e., sequences of home\nautomation events that may realistically occur in an end-user's home, could\nhelp security researchers design better security/safety systems. This paper\npresents Helion, a framework for building a natural perspective of home\nautomation. Helion identifies the regularities in user-driven home automation,\ni.e., from user-driven routines that are increasingly being created by users\nthrough intuitive platform UIs. Our intuition for designing Helion is that\nsmart home event sequences created by users exhibit an inherent set of semantic\npatterns, or naturalness that can be modeled and used to generate valid and\nuseful scenarios. To evaluate our approach, we first empirically demonstrate\nthat this naturalness hypothesis holds, with a corpus of 30,518 home automation\nevents, constructed from 273 routines collected from 40 users. We then\ndemonstrate that the scenarios generated by Helion are reasonable and valid\nfrom an end-user perspective, through an evaluation with 16 external\nevaluators. We further show the usefulness of Helion's scenarios by generating\n17 home security/safety policies with significantly less effort than existing\napproaches. We conclude by discussing key takeaways and future research\nchallenges enabled by Helion's natural perspective of home automation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2019 01:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

Among\nthese stars, we have 135 new identified hot subdwarfs which have not been\ncataloged before. Although 253 stars appear in the catalog by Geier et al.\n(2017) , but only 91 of them have atmospheric parameters. Together with the 294\nhot subdwarf stars found by Lei et al. (2018), we identified 682 hot subdwarf\nstars in total by using the Gaia HR-diagram and LAMOST spectra. These results\ndemonstrate the efficiency of our method to combine large surveys to search for\nhot subdwarf stars. We found a distinct gap in our He-sdOB stars based on their\nHe abundance, which is also presented in extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars\nof the globular cluster (GC) {\\omega} Cen. The number fraction of the sample\nsize for the two sub-groups is very different between the two counterparts.\nHowever, the distinct gap between the H-sdB stars and He-sdOB stars in {\\omega}\nCen is not visible in our sample.

The discrepancy between our field hot subdwarf stars and the EHB stas in\n{\\omega} Cen indicate different origins for the two counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2019 01:37:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

We use an Evans\nmodel (1993) to construct an isothermal mock galaxy whose properties somewhat\nresemble those of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. This mock galaxy\ncontains flattened luminous and dark matter components, resulting in a\nlogarithmic profile for the global potential. We have tested how well our\nSchwarzschild method could constrain the characteristic parameters of the\nsystem for different sample sizes, and also if the functional form of the\npotential was unknown.

Thus, security incidents\ntargeting CPSs can have disruptive consequences to assets and people. As prior\nincidents tend to re-occur, sharing knowledge about these incidents can help\norganizations be more prepared to prevent, mitigate or investigate future\nincidents. This paper proposes a novel approach to enable representation and\nsharing of knowledge about CPS incidents across different organizations. To\nsupport sharing, we represent incident knowledge (incident patterns) capturing\nincident characteristics that can manifest again, such as incident activities\nor vulnerabilities exploited by offenders. Incident patterns are a more\nabstract representation of specific incident instances and, thus, are general\nenough to be applicable to various systems - different than the one in which\nthe incident occurred. They can also avoid disclosing potentially sensitive\ninformation about an organization's assets and resources. We provide an\nautomated technique to extract an incident pattern from a specific incident\ninstance. To understand how an incident pattern can manifest again in other\ncyber-physical systems, we also provide an automated technique to instantiate\nincident patterns to specific systems. We demonstrate the feasibility of our\napproach in the application domain of smart buildings. We evaluate correctness,\nscalability, and performance using two substantive scenarios inspired by\nreal-world systems and incidents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2019 13:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

This representation is based on a direct adaptation of the\nprogressive-wave picture of mixed modes proposed by Takata (2016b). In this\nformulation, a glitch turns out to be characterized by three parameters: its\nacoustic depth, the phase lags introduced after the wave reflection at the\nconsidered point, and a coupling factor. Such an expression has two main\nadvantages. First, it can be easily applicable to a lot of different structural\nconfigurations. Second, it does not assume that the glitch is a small\nperturbation. Actually, we check that the obtained expression tends to the\nformulations previously derived when the glitch is weak.

In order to further reduce the computing time, a warm-start\nalgorithm for the Jacobi iterations in SVD is proposed. A fixed-point simulator\nis used to evaluate the performance of our design. Some synthetic data sets and\na real MRI data set are used to validate the design and evaluate its\nperformance. We compare our work with state-of-the-art software toolboxes\nrunning on both CPU and GPU, and our work shows 2.16 - 30.2x speedup on the\ncardiac MRI data set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 22:22:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-05"}

The main challenge is to\ncapture and weigh friends' preferences, as in practice they do necessarily\nmatch. In this paper, we propose a Neural Attention mechanism for Social\ncollaborative filtering, namely NAS. We design a neural architecture, to\ncarefully compute the non-linearity in friends' preferences by taking into\naccount the social latent effects of friends on user behavior. In addition, we\nintroduce a social behavioral attention mechanism to adaptively weigh the\ninfluence of friends on user preferences and consequently generate accurate\nrecommendations. Our experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed NAS model over other state-of-the-art methods.\nFurthermore, we study the effect of the proposed social behavioral attention\nmechanism and show that it is a key factor to our model's performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2019 15:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-04"}

Entropic Dynamics is an epistemic approach to quantum\nmechanics based on logical inference. It incorporates the probabilities that\nnaturally arise in situations where there is missing information. The\ndevelopment of Entropic Dynamics involves describing a particle in terms of a\nprobability density, and then following the time evolution of the probability\ndensity based on diffusion-like motion and maximization of entropy. Here we\nwill apply Entropic Dynamics to several of the paradigmatic examples used in\nthe instruction of quantum mechanics. These examples include wave packet\nexpansion, interference, the double slit experiment, the harmonic oscillator,\nand entanglement. In the section on the double slit experiment, some\ninteresting insight is gained concerning the occurrence of minima in the\nabsence of a mechanism for destructive interference, since probabilities only\nadd. Also, the section on the harmonic oscillator provides interesting insight\ninto rotation and angular momentum as it pertains to the flow of probability.\nThe last topic consists of some remarks concerning the state of education\nresearch as it pertains to quantum mechanics and the ways in which Entropic\nDynamics might address them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2019 01:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-04"}

This happens when the\ninter-particle interaction is strong enough, thus resulting in a chaotic\nstructure of the many-body eigenstates considered in an unperturbed basis. The\nsemi-analytical approach used here, allows one to estimate the rate of the\nexponential growth as well as the relaxation time, after which the\nequilibration (thermalization) emerges. The key ingredient parameter in the\ndescription of this process is the width $\\Gamma$ of the Local Density of\nStates (LDoS) defined by the initially excited state, the number of particles\nand the interaction strength. In this paper we show that apart from the meaning\nof $\\Gamma$ as the decay rate of survival probability, the width of the LDoS is\ndirectly related to the diagonal entropy and the latter can be linked to the\nthermodynamic entropy of a system equilibrium state emerging after the complete\nrelaxation. The analytical expression relating the two entropies is derived\nphenomenologically and numerically confirmed in a model of bosons with random\ntwo-body interaction, as well as in a deterministic model which becomes\ncompletely integrable in the continuous limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2019 13:16:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 09:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-23"}

The acquired data in XC, called\ndiffraction patterns, is the Fourier magnitudes of the unknown crystalline\nstructure. To estimate the crystalline structure from its diffraction patterns,\nwe propose to modify the traditional system by including an optical element\ncalled coded aperture which modulates the diffracted field to acquire coded\ndiffraction patterns (CDP). For the proposed coded system, in contrast with the\ntraditional, we derive exact reconstruction guarantees for the crystalline\nstructure from CDP (up to a global shift phase). Additionally, exploiting the\nfact that the crystalline structure can be sparsely represented in the Fourier\ndomain, we develop an algorithm to estimate the crystal structure from CDP. We\nshow that this method requires 50% fewer measurements to estimate the crystal\nstructure in comparison with its competitive alternatives.

Based on this decomposition, the\nmicromorphic constitutive relationships are derived for granular materials. In\nthe constitutive relationships, the macroscopic constitutive relationships are\nfirst-order because of the introduce of the independent rotation of particle\ninstead of the second-order micro-deformation gradient.
