Using a previous work where the\nscattering of phonons from a rough surface is mapped to scattering from\nrandomly situated localized phonons in the bulk of a smooth nanowire, we\nconsider the thermal current across a nanowire for various strengths of surface\ndisorder. We use non-equilibrium Green's function techniques that allow us to\nevaluate the thermal current beyond the linear response regime, for arbitrary\ncold and hot temperatures of the two semi-infinite connecting leads. We show\nhow the surface-roughness affects the frequency dependence of the thermal\ncurrent, eventually leading to a temperature dependent reduction of the net\ncurrent at high temperatures. We use a universal disorder parameter to describe\nthe surface-roughness as has been proposed, and show that the dependence of the\nnet current on this parameter provides a natural explanation for the\nexperimentally observed differences between smooth vs rough surfaces. We argue\nthat a systematic study of the thermal current for different values of the\ntemperature difference between the two sides of a surface-roughness dominated\nnanowire for various strengths of disorder would help in our understanding of\nhow best to optimize the thermoelectric efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 2019 17:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

In the introduced\nsystem, the blockchain ledger is located at the communication nodes (CNs), and\nthe MMs associated with CNs process the blockchain's proof-of-work (PoW)\ncomputation to verify the originality of the data. The MM that is the first to\nfinish its PoW will receive a reward by sending its computing result to the CNs\nthat are connected to other MMs. In the considered scenario, a blockchain\nforking event occurs if the MM having the shortest PoW delay fails to be the\nfirst to update its computing result to other MMs. To enable such mobile\noperations for a blockchain with minimum forking events, it is imperative to\nmaintain low-latency wireless communications between MMs and CNs. To analyze\nthe sensitivity of the system to latency, the probability of occurrence of a\nforking event is theoretically derived. The system is then designed so as to\ncompute the forked block's PoW again to recover from a forking event. For this\ncase, the average energy consumption of an MM is derived as a function of the\nsystem parameters such as the number of MMs and power consumed by the\ncomputing, transmission, and mobility processes of the MMs. Simulation results\nverify the analytical derivations and show that using a larger number of MMs\ncan reduce the energy consumption by up to 94.5% compared to a blockchain\nsystem with a single MM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 2019 19:49:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

As\nan interpolation parameter is changed, the pitches in one signal slide to the\npitches in the other, producing a portamento, or musical glide. The assignment\nof pitches in one sound to pitches in the other is accomplished by solving a\n1-dimensional optimal transport problem. In addition, we introduce several\ntechniques that preserve the audio fidelity over this highly non-linear\ntransformation.\n  A portamento is a natural way for a musician to transition between notes, but\ntraditionally it has only been possible for instruments with a continuously\nvariable pitch like the human voice or the violin. Audio transport extends the\nportamento to any instrument, even polyphonic ones. Moreover, the effect can be\nused to transition between different instruments, groups of instruments, or\nreally any transient-less audio signals. The audio transport effect operates in\nreal-time; we open-source implementation is provided.

In\nparticular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known to perform much\nbetter than Fully-Connected Networks (FCNs) on spatially structured data: the\narchitectural structure of CNNs benefits from prior knowledge on the features\nof the data, for instance their translation invariance. The aim of this work is\nto understand this fact through the lens of dynamics in the loss landscape.\n  We introduce a method that maps a CNN to its equivalent FCN (denoted as\neFCN). Such an embedding enables the comparison of CNN and FCN training\ndynamics directly in the FCN space. We use this method to test a new training\nprotocol, which consists in training a CNN, embedding it to FCN space at a\ncertain ``relax time'', then resuming the training in FCN space. We observe\nthat for all relax times, the deviation from the CNN subspace is small, and the\nfinal performance reached by the eFCN is higher than that reachable by a\nstandard FCN of same architecture. More surprisingly, for some intermediate\nrelax times, the eFCN outperforms the CNN it stemmed, by combining the prior\ninformation of the CNN and the expressivity of the FCN in a complementary way.\nThe practical interest of our protocol is limited by the very large size of the\nhighly sparse eFCN. However, it offers interesting insights into the\npersistence of architectural bias under stochastic gradient dynamics. It shows\nthe existence of some rare basins in the FCN loss landscape associated with\nvery good generalization.

There are\ntwo key questions about thin Si today: (a) how much can we still benefit\neconomically from thinning wafers? (b) what are the technological challenges to\ntransition to thin wafers? In this work, we re-evaluate the benefits and\nchallenges of thin Si for current and future PV modules using a comprehensive\ntechno-economic framework that couples device simulation, bottom-up cost\nmodeling, and a cash-flow growth model. When adopting an advanced technology\nconcept that features sufficiently good surface passivation, similarly high\nefficiencies are achievable for 50-um wafers as for 160-um ones. We then\nquantify the economic benefits for thin Si wafers in terms of poly-Si-to-module\nmanufacturing capex, module cost, and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for\nutility PV systems. Particularly, LCOE favors thinner wafers for all\ninvestigated device architectures, and can potentially be reduced by more than\n5% from the value of 160-um wafers. With further improvements in module\nefficiency, an advanced thin-wafer device concept with 50-um wafers could\nreduce manufacturing capex by 48%, module cost by 28%, and LCOE by 24%.\nFurthermore, we apply a sustainable growth model to investigate PV deployment\nscenarios in 2030. It is found that the state-of-the-art industry concept could\nnot achieve the climate targets even with very aggressive financial scenarios,\ntherefore the capex reduction benefit of thin wafers is needed to facilitate\nmore rapid PV growth.

The last years witnessed a revival of interest in the MHD tearing\ninstability as a driver for efficient reconnection. It has been established\nthat, provided the current sheet aspect ratio becomes small enough ($a/L \\sim\nS^{-1/3}$ for a given Lundquist number $S\\gg 1$), reconnection occurs on ideal\nAlfv\\'en timescales and becomes independent on $S$. Here we investigate, by\nmeans of two-dimensional simulations, the \\emph{ideal} tearing instability in\nthe Hall-MHD regime, which is appropriate when the width of the resistive layer\n$\\delta$ becomes comparable to the ion inertial length $d_i$. Moreover, we\nstudy in detail the spontaneous development and reconnection of secondary\ncurrent sheets, which for high $S$ naturally adjust to the ideal aspect ratio\nand hence their evolution proceeds very rapidly. For moderate low $S$, the\naspect ratio tends to the Sweet-Parker scaling ($a/L \\sim S^{-1/2}$), in order\nto fulfill the condition $\\delta \\ll a$ necessary for the onset of a tearing\ninstability. When the Hall term is included, the reconnection rate of this\nsecondary nonlinear phase is enhanced and, depending on the ratio $d_i/\\delta$,\ncan be twice with respect to the pure MHD case, and up to ten times larger than\nthe linear phase. Therefore, the evolution of the tearing instability in thin\ncurrent sheets in the Hall-MHD regime naturally leads to an explosive\ndisruption of the reconnecting site and to energy release on super-Alfv\\'enic\ntimescales, as required to explain astrophysical observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 2019 21:47:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2019 11:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

Sunspots typically appear in pairs of\nopposite magnetic polarities which have a systematic orientation. This polarity\norientation is opposite across the equator -- a trend that has persisted over\nthe last century over which magnetic field observations exist. Taken together\nwith the configuration of the global poloidal field of the Sun -- that governs\nthe heliospheric open flux and cosmic ray flux at Earth -- this phenomenon is\nconsistent with the dipolar parity state of an underlying magnetohydrodynamic\ndynamo. Although hemispheric asymmetry in the emergence of sunspots is observed\nin the Sun, a parity shift has never been observed. We simulate hemispheric\nasymmetry through the introduction of random fluctuations in a computational\ndynamo model of the solar cycle and demonstrate that changes in parity are\nindeed possible in long-term simulations covering thousands of years.\nQuadrupolar modes are found to exist over a significant fraction of the\nsimulated time. In particular, we find that a parity shift in the underlying\nnature of the sunspot cycle is more likely to occur when sunspot activity\ndominates in any one hemisphere for a time which is significantly longer than\nthe cycle period. We establish causal pathways connecting hemispheric asymmetry\nand cross-equatorial phase-shifts to parity flips in the underlying dynamo\nmechanism. Our findings indicate that the solar cycle may have resided in\nquadrupolar parity states in the distant past, and provides a possible pathway\nfor predicting parity flips in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 2019 21:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

A frequently proposed\nexplanation, apart from the possibility of having a third body, is the effect\nof magnetic activity, which may alter the internal structure of the secondary\nstar, particularly its quadrupole moment, and thereby cause quasi-periodic\noscillations. Here we present two compressible non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamical\n(MHD) simulations of the magnetic dynamo in a solar mass star, one of them with\nthree times the solar rotation rate (\"slow rotator\"), the other one with twenty\ntimes the solar rotation rate (\"rapid rotator\"), to account for the high\nrotational velocities in close binary systems. For the slow rotator, we find\nthat both the magnetic field and the stellar quadrupole moment change in a\nquasi-periodic manner, leading to O-C (observed - corrected times of the\neclipse) variations of ~0.025 s. For the rapid rotator, the behavior of the\nmagnetic field as well as the quadrupole moment changes become considerably\nmore complex, due to the less coherent dynamo solution. The resulting O-C\nvariations are of the order 0.13 s. The observed system V471~Tau shows two\nmodes of eclipsing time variations, with amplitudes of 151 s and 20 s,\nrespectively. However, the current simulations may not capture all relevant\neffects due to the neglect of the centrifugal force and self-gravity.\nConsidering the model limitations and that the rotation of V471 Tau is still a\nfactor of 2.5 faster than our rapid rotator, it may be conceivable to reach the\nobserved magnitudes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 2019 22:35:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 17:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

While a vast\namount of research has been focused on different prior models, the fidelity\nterm is almost always chosen to be the least squares (LS) objective, that\nencourages fitting the linearly transformed optimization variable to the\nobservations. In this paper, we examine a different fidelity term, which has\nbeen implicitly used by the recently proposed iterative denoising and backward\nprojections (IDBP) framework.

The predictor network uses\nthe observations selected by the selector network to predict a label, providing\nfeedback to the selector network (well-selected variables should be predictive\nof the label).

Our main contribution is to extend some\ngeneral equilibrium results to an incomplete-market Bewley-type economy with\nmany consumption goods. Under mild conditions on the agents' preferences, we\nshow that the aggregate demand for goods depends only on their relative prices\nand that the aggregate demand for savings is homogeneous of degree in prices,\nand we prove the existence of a CSE. When the agents' preferences can be\nrepresented by a CES (constant elasticity of substitution) utility function\nwith an elasticity of substitution that is higher than or equal to one, we\nprove that the CSE is unique. Under the same preferences, we show that a higher\ninequality of endowments does not change the equilibrium prices of goods, and\ndecreases the equilibrium interest rate.

This paper focuses on HNE for massive graphs, e.g., with\nbillions of edges. On this scale, most existing approaches fail, as they incur\neither prohibitively high costs, or severely compromised result utility. Our\nproposed solution, called Node-Reweighted PageRank (NRP), is based on a classic\nidea of deriving embedding vectors from pairwise personalized PageRank (PPR)\nvalues. Our contributions are twofold: first, we design a simple and efficient\nbaseline HNE method based on PPR that is capable of handling billion-edge\ngraphs on commodity hardware; second and more importantly, we identify an\ninherent drawback of vanilla PPR, and address it in our main proposal NRP.\nSpecifically, PPR was designed for a very different purpose, i.e., ranking\nnodes in G based on their relative importance from a source node's perspective.\nIn contrast, HNE aims to build node embeddings considering the whole graph.\nConsequently, node embeddings derived directly from PPR are of suboptimal\nutility. The proposed NRP approach overcomes the above deficiency through an\neffective and efficient node reweighting algorithm, which augments PPR values\nwith node degree information, and iteratively adjusts embedding vectors\naccordingly. Overall, NRP takes O(mlogn) time and O(m) space to compute all\nnode embeddings for a graph with m edges and n nodes. Our extensive experiments\nthat compare NRP against 18 existing solutions over 7 real graphs demonstrate\nthat NRP achieves higher result utility than all the solutions for link\nprediction, graph reconstruction and node classification, while being up to\norders of magnitude faster. In particular, on a billion-edge Twitter graph, NRP\nterminates within 4 hours, using a single CPU core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 03:18:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 08:05:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 06:21:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 01:26:03 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 03:48:31 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

The\nmain goal of the present paper is to provide a proof of this conjecture in as\nbroad a context as possible, making use of the technique of derived completion,\nand to consider several of the applications.\n  Our solution is broad enough to allow actions by all linear algebraic groups,\nirrespective of whether they are connected or not, and acting on any\nquasi-projective scheme of finite type over a field, irrespective of whether\nthey are regular or projective. This allows us therefore to consider the\nEquivariant Algebraic G-Theory of large classes of varieties like all Toric\nvarieties (for the action of a torus) and all Spherical varieties (for the\naction of a reductive group). Restricting to actions by split tori, we are also\nable to consider actions on Algebraic Spaces. These enable us to obtain a wide\nrange of applications, some of which are briefly sketched and which we plan to\nexplore in detail in the future.

This method is also applied to the semiparametric regression to\ntest the goodness-of-fit of the model. These tests are asymptotically optimal\nin terms of the rate of convergence, as they can detect a specific class of\ncontiguous alternatives at a rate of $n^{-1/2}$. An extensive simulation study\nis presented to support the theoretical results derived in this paper. Finally,\nthe method is applied to a real data to model the diamond price based on its\nquality attributes and physical measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 03:33:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

Lubin-Tate formal groups also arise from this universal formal\ngroup. If two $p$-adic fields have isomorphic multiplicative monoids\n$\\mathcal{O}^\\triangleright$ then the additive structure of one arises from\nthat of the other by means of this universal formal group law (in a suitable\nmanner). In particular if two $p$-adic fields have isomorphic absolute Galois\ngroups then it is well-known that the two respective monoids\n$\\mathcal{O}^\\triangleright$ are isomorphic and so this construction can be\napplied to such $p$-adic fields. In this sense this universal formal group law\nprovides a single additive structure which binds together $p$-adic fields whose\nabsolute Galois groups are isomorphic (this anabelian variation of ring\nstructure is studied and used extensively by Shinichi Mochizuki).

The observed CNM fraction is\nhigher around GMCs than in diffuse regions, and increases with increasing\ncolumn density (NHI) to a maximum of ~75%. On average, the optically thin\napproximation (N*(HI)) underestimates the total N(HI) by ~21%, but we find\nlarge regional differences in the relationship between N(HI) and the required\ncorrection factor, f=N(HI)/N*(HI). We examine two different methods (linear fit\nof f vs log10(N*(HI)) and uniform Ts) to correct for opacity effects using\nemission data from the GALFA-HI survey. We prefer the uniform Ts method, since\nthe linear relationship does not produce convincing fits for all subregions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 05:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

Despite their successful\napplications, those pruning methods based on Lasso either produce irregular\nsparse patterns in weight matrices, which is not helpful in practical speedup.\nTo address these issues, we propose structured pruning method through neuron\nselection which can reduce the sizes of basic structures of RNNs.

But smaller\nmodels also tend to have high bias. This suggests a trade-off between\ninterpretability and accuracy. Our work addresses this by: (a) showing that\nlearning a training distribution (often different from the test distribution)\ncan often increase accuracy of small models, and therefore may be used as a\nstrategy to compensate for small sizes, and (b) providing a model-agnostic\nalgorithm to learn such training distributions. We pose the distribution\nlearning problem as one of optimizing parameters for an Infinite Beta Mixture\nModel based on a Dirichlet Process, so that the held-out accuracy of a model\ntrained on a sample from this distribution is maximized.

Our objective is to minimize the\ncomputation error by jointly optimizing the transmit power at the\npower-constrained devices and a signal scaling factor (called denoising factor)\nat the fusion center (FC). The problem is generally non-convex due to the\ncoupling of the transmit power over devices and denoising factor at the FC. To\ntackle the challenge, we first consider the special case with static channels,\nfor which we derive the optimal solution in closed form. The optimal power\ncontrol exhibits a threshold-based structure. Specifically, for each device, if\nthe product of the channel quality and power budget, called quality indicator,\nexceeds an optimized threshold, this device applies channel-inversion power\ncontrol; otherwise, it performs full power transmission. Building on the\nresults, we proceed to consider the general case with time-varying channels.

Previous attention mechanism employed in image-text matching either\ntakes multiple self attention steps to gather correspondences or uses image\nobjects (or words) as context to infer image-text similarity. However, they\nonly take advantage of semantic information without considering that objects'\nrelative position also contributes to image understanding. To this end, we\nintroduce a novel position-aware relation module to model both the semantic and\nspatial relationship simultaneously for image-text matching in this paper.\nGiven an image, our method utilizes the location of different objects to\ncapture spatial relationship innovatively. With the combination of semantic and\nspatial relationship, it's easier to understand the content of different\nmodalities (images and sentences) and capture fine-grained latent\ncorrespondences of image-text pairs.

Of particular importance is to optimize\nthe placement of the limited available substitution inertia, to mitigate\nvoltage angle and frequency disturbances following a fault such as an abrupt\npower loss. Performance measures in the form of H2-norms have been recently\nintroduced to evaluate the overall magnitude of such disturbances on an\nelectric power grid. However, despite the mathematical conveniance of these\nmeasures, analytical results can be obtained only under rather restrictive\nassumptions of uniform damping ratio, or homogeneous distribution of inertia\nand/or primary control in the system.

Armed with that efficient tool, we\nconstruct two simple algorithms that independently determine the optimal\ngeographical distribution of inertia and primary control. These algorithms are\nthen implemented on a model of the synchronous transmission grid of continental\nEurope.

In this context, theoretical screening of new magnetic molecules\nprovides invaluable knowledge before carrying out sophisticated experiments.\nHerein, we investigate the transport properties of three equatorially\nlow-coordinated erbium single ion magnets with $C_{3v}$ symmetry:\nEr[N(SiMe$_3$)$_2$]$_3$ (1), Er(btmsm)$_3$ (2) and Er(dbpc)$_3$ (3), where\nbtmsm = bis(trimethylsilyl)methyl and dbpc = 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresolate. Our\nligand field analysis, based on previous spectroscopic data, confirms a ground\nstate mainly characterized by $M_J$ =$\\pm$15/2 in all three of them. The\nrelaxation of their molecular structures when placed between two Au (111)\nelectrodes leads to an even more symmetric $\\sim D_{3h}$ environment, which\nensures that these molecules would retain their single-molecule magnet behavior\nin the device setup. Hence, we simulate spin dependent transport using the DFT\noptimized structures on the basis of the non-equilibrium Green's function\nformalism, which, in 1 and 2, suggests a remarkable molecular spin filtering\nunder the effect of an external magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 10:31:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

The planetesimals\ncannot be observed directly, yet they produce detectable dust in mutual\ncollisions. Observing the dust, we can try to infer properties of invisible\nplanetesimals. Here we address the question of what is the best way to measure\nthe location of outer planetesimal belts that encompass extrasolar planetary\nsystems. A standard method is using resolved images at mm-wavelengths, which\nreveal dust grains with sizes comparable to the observational wavelength.\nSmaller grains seen in the infrared (IR) are subject to several\nnon-gravitational forces that drag them away from their birth rings, and so may\nnot closely trace the parent bodies. In this study, we examine whether imaging\nof debris discs at shorter wavelengths might enable determining the spatial\nlocation of the exo-Kuiper belts with sufficient accuracy. We find that around\nM-type stars the dust best visible in the mid-IR is efficiently displaced\ninward from their birth location by stellar winds, causing the discs to look\nmore compact in mid-IR images than they actually are. However, around\nearlier-type stars where the majority of debris discs is found, discs are still\nthe brightest at the birth ring location in the mid-IR regime. Thus, sensitive\nIR facilities with good angular resolution, such as MIRI on JWST, will enable\ntracing exo-Kuiper belts in nearby debris disc systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 11:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

Other ecological patterns also have simple forms. Why does\nthe complexity and variability of ecological systems reduce to such simplicity?\nCommon answers include maximum entropy, neutrality, and convergent outcome from\ndifferent underlying biological processes. This article proposes a more general\nanswer based on the concept of invariance, the property by which a pattern\nremains the same after transformation. Invariance has a long tradition in\nphysics. For example, general relativity emphasizes the need for the equations\ndescribing the laws of physics to have the same form in all frames of\nreference. By bringing this unifying invariance approach into ecology, we show\nthat the log series pattern dominates when the consequences of processes acting\non abundance are invariant to the addition or multiplication of abundance by a\nconstant. The lognormal pattern dominates when the processes acting on net\nspecies growth rate obey rotational invariance (symmetry) with respect to the\nsumming up of the individual component processes. Recognizing how these\ninvariances connect pattern to process leads to a synthesis of previous\napproaches. First, invariance provides a simpler and more fundamental maximum\nentropy derivation of the log series distribution. Second, invariance provides\na simple derivation of the key result from neutral theory: the log series at\nthe metacommunity scale and a clearer form of the skewed lognormal at the local\ncommunity scale. The invariance expressions are easy to understand because they\nuniquely describe the basic underlying components that shape pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 12:07:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 07:21:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

We show that the solution to the\nhome-return problem can then be given in terms of the solution to the\ncorresponding free-range problem---which not only reduces overall complexity\nbut also gives rise to a simple, and universal, phase-diagram for search. The\nlatter reveals that search with home returns outperforms free-range search in\nconditions of high uncertainty. Thus, when living gets rough, a home will not\nonly provide warmth and shelter but also allow one to locate food and other\nresources quickly and more efficiently than in its absence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 12:23:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 17:48:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 14:17:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

The current observational cosmology is starting to be limited by\nthe presence of systematic effects. The Stokes polarimeter with a rotating Half\nWave Plate (HWP) has the advantage of mitigating a long list of potential\nsystematics, by modulation of the linearly polarized component of the\nradiation, but the presence of the rotating HWP can by itself introduce new\nsystematic effects, which must be under control, representing one of the most\ncritical part in the design of a B-Modes experiment.

We then perform several\nnumerical simulations, showing the effect induced on the Stokes parameters by\nthis systematic.

While most SLAM approaches provide a geometrical\nrepresentation of the scene, a semantic map is necessary for more complex\ninteractions with the surroundings. Current methods treat the semantic map as\npart of the geometry which limits scalability and accuracy. We propose to\nrepresent the semantic map as a geometrical mesh and a semantic texture coupled\nat independent resolution. The key idea is that in many environments the\ngeometry can be greatly simplified without loosing fidelity, while semantic\ninformation can be stored at a higher resolution, independent of the mesh. We\nconstruct a mesh from depth sensors to represent the scene geometry and fuse\ninformation into the semantic texture from segmentations of individual RGB\nviews of the scene. Making the semantics persistent in a global mesh enables us\nto enforce temporal and spatial consistency of the individual view predictions.\nFor this, we propose an efficient method of establishing consensus between\nindividual segmentations by iteratively retraining semantic segmentation with\nthe information stored within the map and using the retrained segmentation to\nre-fuse the semantics.

Firstly, a decomposition formula for European option\nprices under general Volterra volatility models is introduced. Then we focus on\nparticular models with rough fractional volatility and we derive an explicit\nsemi-closed approximation formula. Numerical properties of the approximation\nfor a popular model -- the rBergomi model -- are studied and we propose a\nhybrid calibration scheme which combines the approximation formula alongside MC\nsimulations. This scheme can significantly speed up the calibration to\nfinancial markets as illustrated on a set of AAPL options.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 15:56:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 13:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-02"}

These conductances depend on previous depolarizing membrane\nvoltages, which can be identified with a memory resistive element called\nmemristor. Inspired by the recent quantization of the memristor, a simplified\nHodgkin-Huxley model including a single ion channel has been studied in the\nquantum regime. Here, we study the quantization of the complete Hodgkin-Huxley\nmodel, accounting for all three ion channels, and introduce a quantum source,\ntogether with an output waveguide as the connection to a subsequent neuron. Our\nsystem consists of two memristors and one resistor, describing potassium,\nsodium, and chloride ion channel conductances, respectively, and a capacitor to\naccount for the axon's membrane capacitance. We study the behavior of both ion\nchannel conductivities and the circuit voltage, and we compare the results with\nthose of the single channel, for a given quantum state of the source. It is\nremarkable that, in opposition to the single-channel model, we are able to\nreproduce the voltage spike in an adiabatic regime. Arguing that the circuit\nvoltage is a quantum variable, we find a purely quantum-mechanical contribution\nin the system voltage's second moment. This work represents a complete study of\nthe Hodgkin-Huxley model in the quantum regime, establishing a recipe for\nconstructing quantum neuron networks with quantum state inputs. This paves the\nway for advances in hardware-based neuromorphic quantum computing, as well as\nquantum machine learning, which might be more efficient resource-wise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 2019 20:10:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 15:42:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Dec 2021 11:13:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-13"}

Therefore, the mesh-based finite\nelement descriptions common in structural optimisation must be first translated\ninto CAD models. Currently, this can at best be performed semi-manually. We\npropose a fully automated and topologically accurate approach to synthesise a\nstructurally-sound parametric CAD model from topology optimised finite element\nmodels. Our solution is to first convert the topology optimised structure into\na spatial frame structure and then to regenerate it in a CAD system using\nstandard constructive solid geometry (CSG) operations. The obtained parametric\nCAD models are compact, that is, have as few as possible geometric parameters,\nwhich makes them ideal for editing and further processing within a CAD system.\nThe critical task of converting the topology optimised structure into an\noptimal spatial frame structure is accomplished in several steps. We first\ngenerate from the topology optimised voxel model a one-voxel-wide voxel chain\nmodel using a topology-preserving skeletonisation algorithm from digital\ntopology. The weighted undirected graph defined by the voxel chain model yields\na spatial frame structure after processing it with standard graph algorithms.\nSubsequently, we optimise the cross-sections and layout of the frame members to\nrecover its optimality, which may have been compromised during the conversion\nprocess. At last, we generate the obtained frame structure in a CAD system by\nrepeatedly combining primitive solids, like cylinders and spheres, using\nboolean operations. The resulting solid model is a boundary representation\n(B-Rep) consisting of trimmed non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) curves and\nsurfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 15:09:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 22:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Future weak lensing surveys, such as the Euclid mission, will\nattempt to measure the shapes of billions of galaxies in order to derive\ncosmological information. These surveys will attain very low levels of\nstatistical error, and systematic errors must be extremely well controlled. In\nparticular, the point spread function (PSF) must be estimated using stars in\nthe field, and recovered with high accuracy.\n  Aims. The aims of this paper are twofold. Firstly, we took steps toward a\nnonparametric method to address the issue of recovering the PSF field, namely\nthat of finding the correct PSF at the position of any galaxy in the field,\napplicable to Euclid. Our approach relies solely on the data, as opposed to\nparametric methods that make use of our knowledge of the instrument. Secondly,\nwe studied the impact of imperfect PSF models on the shape measurement of\ngalaxies themselves, and whether common assumptions about this impact hold true\nin an Euclid scenario.\n  Methods. We extended the recently proposed resolved components analysis\napproach, which performs super-resolution on a field of under-sampled\nobservations of a spatially varying, image-valued function. We added a spatial\ninterpolation component to the method, making it a true 2-dimensional PSF\nmodel. We compared our approach to PSFEx, then quantified the impact of PSF\nrecovery errors on galaxy shape measurements through image simulations.\n  Results. Our approach yields an improvement over PSFEx in terms of the PSF\nmodel and on observed galaxy shape errors, though it is at present far from\nreaching the required Euclid accuracy. We also find that the usual formalism\nused for the propagation of PSF model errors to weak lensing quantities no\nlonger holds in the case of an Euclid-like PSF. In particular, different shape\nmeasurement approaches can react differently to the same PSF modeling errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 11:50:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 17:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

That is because most PUFs\ndirectly utilize the underlying microelectronics, but that intrinsic randomness\ncan be limited and may thus be predicted, especially by machine learning.\nOptical PUFs, in contrast, are still considered as promising---they can derive\nstrong, hard-to-predict randomness independently from microelectronics, by\nusing some kind of \"optical token.\" Here we propose a novel concept for\nplasmonics-enhanced optical PUFs, or peo-PUFs in short. For the first time, we\nleverage two highly nonlinear phenomena in conjunction by construction: (i)\nlight propagation in a silicon disk resonator, and (ii) surface plasmons\narising from nanoparticles arranged randomly on top of the resonator. We\nelaborate on the physical phenomena, provide simulation results, and conduct a\nsecurity analysis of peo- PUFs for secure key generation and authentication.\nThis study highlights the good potential of peo-PUFs, and our future work is to\nfocus on fabrication and characterization of such PUFs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 10:23:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-01"}
