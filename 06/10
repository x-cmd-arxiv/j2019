In this work, we formalize the problem of learning\nthe continuous-time Koopman operator with deep neural networks in a\nmeasure-theoretic framework. Our approach induces two types of models:\ndifferential and recurrent form, the choice of which depends on the\navailability of the governing equations and data. We then enforce a structural\nparameterization that renders the realization of the Koopman operator provably\nstable. A new autoencoder architecture is constructed, such that only the\nresidual of the dynamic mode decomposition is learned. Finally, we employ\nmean-field variational inference (MFVI) on the aforementioned framework in a\nhierarchical Bayesian setting to quantify uncertainties in the characterization\nand prediction of the dynamics of observables.

Driving TE to zero by increasing fitting degrees of freedom (dof) is\nexpected to increase GE. However modern big-data approaches, including deep\nnets, seem to over-parametrize and send TE to zero (data interpolation) without\nimpacting GE. Overparametrization has the benefit that global minima of the\nempirical loss function proliferate and become easier to find. These phenomena\nhave drawn theoretical attention. Regression and classification algorithms have\nbeen shown that interpolate data but also generalize optimally. An interesting\nrelated phenomenon has been noted: the existence of non-monotonic risk curves,\nwith a peak in GE with increasing dof. It was suggested that this peak\nseparates a classical regime from a modern regime where over-parametrization\nimproves performance. Similar over-fitting peaks were reported previously\n(statistical physics approach to learning) and attributed to increased fitting\nmodel flexibility. We introduce a generative and fitting model pair\n(\"Misparametrized Sparse Regression\" or MiSpaR) and show that the overfitting\npeak can be dissociated from the point at which the fitting function gains\nenough dof's to match the data generative model and thus provides good\ngeneralization. This complicates the interpretation of overfitting peaks as\nseparating a \"classical\" from a \"modern\" regime. Data interpolation itself\ncannot guarantee good generalization: we need to study the interpolation with\ndifferent penalty terms.

The\nmethod of the drift-field is introduced. A systematic treatment of nodes is\ngiven. A category of quantum states is found for which relaxation is\nsignificantly impeded, and may not complete at all.\n  Chapters 4 and 5 consider the possibility that primordial quantum\nnonequilibrium may be conserved in the statistics of a species of relic\ncosmological particle. Necessary factors for this to be the case are discussed\nand illustrative scenarios are given both in terms of nonequilibrium particles\ncreated by inflaton decay, as well as relic vacuum modes for species that\ndecoupled close to the Planck temperature. The search for so-called\n`smoking-gun' spectral lines created by dark matter decay or annihilation is\nargued to be a particularly promising setting for the detection of quantum\nnonequilibrium. Unintuitive spectral effects relating to the contextuality of\nquantum measurements are described. If such a suspected source of quantum\nnonequilibrium were found, its subjection to a specifically quantum mechanical\ntest would confirm or deny the presence of the quantum nonequilibrium\nconclusively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jun 2019 16:45:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}

Thus, values of fundamental constants such as\nthe proton-to-electron mass ratio, mu, and/or the fine structure constant,\nalpha, measured in different environment conditions can be used as probes for\nthis coupling.

The analysis is based on\n[CI] and CO lines observed with the Herschel Space Observatory.

To better\nunderstand this phenomenon, we analyze the behavior of pruning over the course\nof training, finding that pruning's benefit to generalization increases with\npruning's instability (defined as the drop in test accuracy immediately\nfollowing pruning).

The perturbation is usually created by adding/deleting a\nfew edges, which might be noticeable even when the number of edges modified is\nsmall.

In the high-dimensional regime the\nunderlying parameter vector is often structured (sparse, block-sparse,\nfinite-alphabet, etc.) and so in this paper we study regularized logistic\nregression (RLR), where a convex regularizer that encourages the desired\nstructure is added to the negative of the log-likelihood function. An advantage\nof RLR is that it allows parameter recovery even for instances where the\n(unconstrained) maximum likelihood estimate does not exist. We provide a\nprecise analysis of the performance of RLR via the solution of a system of six\nnonlinear equations, through which any performance metric of interest (mean,\nmean-squared error, probability of support recovery, etc.) can be explicitly\ncomputed.

Batch normalization (BN) is a\ncrucial element for achieving state-of-the-art performance on many vision\ntasks, but we show it may prevent networks from obtaining strong robustness in\nadversarial training. One unexpected observation is that, for models trained\nwith BN, simply removing clean images from training data largely boosts\nadversarial robustness, i.e., 18.3%. We relate this phenomenon to the\nhypothesis that clean images and adversarial images are drawn from two\ndifferent domains. This two-domain hypothesis may explain the issue of BN when\ntraining with a mixture of clean and adversarial images, as estimating\nnormalization statistics of this mixture distribution is challenging. Guided by\nthis two-domain hypothesis, we show disentangling the mixture distribution for\nnormalization, i.e., applying separate BNs to clean and adversarial images for\nstatistics estimation, achieves much stronger robustness. Additionally, we find\nthat enforcing BNs to behave consistently at training and testing can further\nenhance robustness.\n  Second, we study the role of network capacity. We find our so-called \"deep\"\nnetworks are still shallow for the task of adversarial learning. Unlike\ntraditional classification tasks where accuracy is only marginally improved by\nadding more layers to \"deep\" networks (e.g., ResNet-152), adversarial training\nexhibits a much stronger demand on deeper networks to achieve higher\nadversarial robustness. This robustness improvement can be observed\nsubstantially and consistently even by pushing the network capacity to an\nunprecedented scale, i.e., ResNet-638.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 03:41:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Dec 2019 20:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

Transductive inference that utilizes unlabeled test\nset to deal with low-data problem has been employed for few-shot learning in\nrecent literature. Yet, these methods do not explicitly exploit the manifold\nstructures of semantic clusters, which is inefficient for transductive\ninference. In this paper, we propose a novel Progressive Cluster Purification\n(PCP) method for transductive few-shot learning. The PCP can progressively\npurify the cluster by exploring the semantic interdependency in the individual\ncluster space. Specifically, the PCP consists of two-level operations:\ninter-class classification and intra-class transduction. The inter-class\nclassification partitions all the test samples into several clusters by\ncomparing the test samples with the prototypes. The intra-class transduction\neffectively explores trustworthy test samples for each cluster by modeling data\nrelations within a cluster as well as among different clusters. Then, it\nrefines the prototypes to better represent the real distribution of semantic\nclusters. The refined prototypes are used to remeasure all the test instances\nand purify each cluster. Furthermore, the inter-class classification and the\nintra-class transduction are extremely flexible to be repeated several times to\nprogressively purify the clusters.

Based on recent advances in approximate Bayesian inference,\na doubly stochastic variational inference is developed, which allows the\nproposed DCM-ARD model to scale to very large and high-dimensional datasets.\nUsing semi-artificial choice data, the proposed approach is shown to very\naccurately recover the true utility function specifications that govern the\nobserved choices. Moreover, when applied to real choice data, DCM-ARD is shown\nto be able discover high quality specifications that can outperform previous\nones from the literature according to multiple criteria, thereby demonstrating\nits practical applicability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 09:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}

While a few prior\nresearch efforts have explored the benefits of leveraging still-image datasets\nfor video analysis, or vice-versa, most of these attempts have been limited to\npretraining a model on one type of visual modality and then adapting it via\nfinetuning on the other modality.

It consists\nof a shared 2D spatial convolution followed by two parallel point-wise\nconvolutional layers, one devoted to images and the other one used for videos.\nFor video input, the point-wise filtering implements a temporal convolution.\nFor image input, it performs a pixel-wise nonlinear transformation.

Radio\ninterferometric observations typically trade-off surface brightness sensitivity\nfor angular resolution. Hence, observations using a wide range of baseline\nlengths are required to recover both bright small-scale structures and diffuse\nextended emission. We investigate if generative adversarial networks (GANs) can\nextract additional information from radio data and might ultimately recover\nextended flux from a survey with a high angular resolution and vice versa. We\nuse a GAN for the image-to-image translation between two different data sets,\nnamely the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST) and the\nNRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) radio surveys. The GAN is trained to generate the\ncorresponding image cutout from the other survey for a given input. The results\nare analyzed with a variety of metrics, including structural similarity as well\nas flux and size comparison of the extracted sources. RadioGAN is able to\nrecover extended flux density within a $20\\%$ margin for almost half of the\nsources and learns more complex relations between sources in the two surveys\nthan simply convolving them with a different synthesized beam. RadioGAN is also\nable to achieve subbeam resolution by recognizing complicated underlying\nstructures from unresolved sources. RadioGAN generates over a third of the\nsources within a $20\\%$ deviation from both original size and flux for the\nFIRST to NVSS translation, while for the NVSS to FIRST mapping it achieves\nalmost $30\\%$ within this range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 09:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}

Here we develop such a method using spin-2 spherical harmonics to\ndecompose the linear polarization in terms of the parity-even and parity-odd E\nand B polarizations, respectively. Using simple one- and two-dimensional\nmodels, we show that the product of the spectral decompositions of E and B,\ntaken at spherical harmonic degrees that are shifted by one, can act as a proxy\nof the global magnetic helicity with a sign that represents that in the\nnorthern hemisphere.

We find a negative sign of the global EB helicity\nproxy at spherical harmonic degrees of around 6. This could indicate a positive\nmagnetic helicity at large length scales, but the spectrum fails to capture\nclear evidence of the well-known negative magnetic helicity at smaller scales.\nThis method might also be applicable to stellar and Galactic polarization data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 10:17:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 13:51:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 02:14:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 15 Sep 2019 07:34:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-30"}

The galaxy is initially composed of an\naxisymmetric, exponential stellar disk embedded in a spherical dark matter\nhalo. The parameters of the model are chosen so that the galaxy is mildly\nunstable to bar formation and the evolution is followed for 10 Gyr. A strong\nbar forms slowly over the first few Gyr and buckles after 4.5 Gyr from the\nstart of the simulation becoming much weaker and developing a pronounced\nboxy/peanut shape. We measure the properties of the bar at the time of buckling\nin terms of the mean acceleration, velocity and distortion in the vertical\ndirection. The maps of these quantities in face-on projections reveal\ncharacteristic quadrupole patterns which wind up over a short time-scale. We\nalso detect a secondary buckling event lasting much longer and occurring only\nin the outer part of the bar. We then study the orbital structure of the bar in\nperiods before and after the first buckling. We find that most of the buckling\norbits originate from x1 orbits supporting the bar. During buckling the ratio\nof the vertical to horizontal frequency of the stellar orbits decreases\ndramatically and after buckling the orbits obey a very tight relation between\nthe vertical and circular frequency: $3 \\nu = 4 \\Omega$. We propose that\nbuckling is initiated by the vertical resonance of the x1 orbits creating the\ninitial distortion of the bar that later evolves as kinematic bending waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 11:48:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 13:26:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 3 Aug 2019 14:36:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

It has been recently shown that, for centralized planning, the\nperformance of goal oriented search can be improved by combining goal oriented\nsearch and width-based search. The combination of these techniques has been\ncalled best-first width search. In this paper, we investigate the usage of\nbest-first width search in the context of (decentralised) multi-agent\nprivacy-preserving planning, addressing the challenges related to the agents'\nprivacy and performance. In particular, we show that best-first width search is\na very effective approach over several benchmark domains, even when the search\nis driven by heuristics that roughly estimate the distance from goal states,\ncomputed without using the private information of other agents. An experimental\nstudy analyses the effectiveness of our techniques and compares them with the\nstate-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 13:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}

The connectivity analysis was carried out by\nfollowing the probability $R_{L,k}(p)$ that a lattice composed of $L \\times L$\nsites percolates at a concentration $p$ of sites occupied by particles of size\n$k$. The results, obtained for $k$ ranging from 2 to 80, showed that the\npercolation threshold $p_c(k)$ exhibits a increasing function when it is\nplotted as a function of the $k$-mer size.

Helium admixtures with\nxenon can be an attractive solution to reduce the electron diffusion\nsignificantly, improving the discrimination efficiency of these optical TPCs.\nWe have measured the electroluminescence (EL) yield of Xe-He mixtures, in the\nrange of 0 to 30% He and demonstrated the small impact on the EL yield of the\naddition of helium to pure xenon. For a typical reduced electric field of 2.5\nkV/cm/bar in the scintillation region, the EL yield is lowered by ~ 2%, 3%, 6%\nand 10% for 10%, 15%, 20% and 30% of helium concentration, respectively.

From\nsingle-phase PIV measurements, it is found that the gas velocity in the\nvicinity of the prefilmer partly matches the analytical profile from the\nnear-wake theory. The characteristics of the liquid accumulation are extracted\nfrom the shadowgraphy images of the liquid phase directly downstream of the\nprefilmer. Two different characteristic lengths, as well as the ligament\nvelocity and a breakup frequency are determined.

Inspired by the\nancient Greeks, who believed that matter was made of the combination of four\nelements (earth, water, air and fire), we formulated a multi-component Magnetic\nResonance (MR) Fingerprinting framework, where every voxel was considered a\nweighted combination of four base elements: bone, water, air and fat. We named\nour approach Aristotelian MR based attenuation correction (ARISTOMRAC). We used\na 3D radial acquisition scheme at 1.5T, acquiring a transient-state spoiled\nacquisition with variable flip angles and echo times (TE), with the shortest\nTEs being ultra-short echo times (UTE). We simulated a multi-tissue MR signal\nmodel using the Bloch equations and used dictionary matching to extract tissue\nfraction maps for bone water and fat, while air fractions were obtained by\nthresholding the UTE parts of our acquisitions at higher spatial resolution.\nCompared to previous methods for MR-based Attenuation Correction (MRAC), our\napproach used a full multi-component signal model, including multiple tissues\nper voxel. For this reason, rather than reconstructing high resolutions images,\nMR data can be acquired more efficiently, directly at the resolution needed for\nPET attenuation maps. The ARISTOMRAC method allows to accurately estimate the\nair, water, bone and fat fractions (Concordance Correlation Coefficient =\n0.81/0.91/0.98 for bone, water and fat respectively).

A number of studies have estimated occupation-specific risk\nprofiles by examining the automatability of associated skills and tasks.\nHowever, relatively little work has sought to take a more holistic view on the\nprocess of labor reallocation and how employment prospects are impacted as\ndisplaced workers transition into new jobs. In this paper, we develop a new\ndata-driven model to analyze how workers move through an empirically derived\noccupational mobility network in response to automation scenarios which\nincrease labor demand for some occupations and decrease it for others. At the\nmacro level, our model reproduces a key stylized fact in the labor market known\nas the Beveridge curve and provides new insights for explaining the curve's\ncounter-clockwise cyclicality. At the micro level, our model provides\noccupation-specific estimates of changes in short and long-term unemployment\ncorresponding to a given automation shock. We find that the network structure\nplays an important role in determining unemployment levels, with occupations in\nparticular areas of the network having very few job transition opportunities.\nSuch insights could be fruitfully applied to help design more efficient and\neffective policies aimed at helping workers adapt to the changing nature of the\nlabor market.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 15:59:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 10:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 09:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

Our contribution to this special\nissue of Universe amounts to an application of a model for black hole accretion\nand jet formation to these observations. For illustrative purposes we include\nabout 100,000 data points from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7\nwhere the sub-Eddington boundary is also visible, and propose a theoretical\npicture that explains these features. By appealing to thin disk theory and both\nthe lower accretion efficiency and the time evolution of jetted quasars\ncompared to non-jetted quasars in our 'gap paradigm', we explain two features\nof the sub-Eddington boundary. First, we show that a drop-off on the quasar\nmass-luminosity plane for larger black hole mass occurs at all redshifts. But\nthe fraction of jetted quasars is directly related to the merger function in\nthis paradigm, which means the jetted quasar fraction drops with decrease in\nredshift, which allows us to explain a second feature of the sub-Eddington\nboundary, namely a redshift dependence of the slope of the quasar\nmass-luminosity boundary at high black hole mass stemming from a change in\nradiative efficiency with time. We are able to reproduce the mass dependence\nof, as well as the oscillating behavior in, the slope of the sub-Eddington\nboundary as a function of time. The basic physical idea involves retrograde\naccretion occurring only for a subset of the more massive black holes which\nimplies that most spinning black holes in our model are prograde accretors. In\nshort, this paper amounts to a qualitative overview of how a sub-Eddington\nboundary naturally emerges in the gap paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 14:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

However, most of\nthese models view the representation problem of the test samples as a\ndeterministic problem, ignoring the uncertainty of the representation. The\nuncertainty is caused by two factors, random noise in the samples and the\nintrinsic randomness of the sample set, which means that if we capture a group\nof samples, the obtained set of samples will be different in different\nconditions.

In this paper a\nmethod is proposed that uses a camera that takes images of slaughtered chicken\non the conveyor in a slaughter house, the images are then analyzed by a deep\nneural network to classify if the image is of a halal slaughtered chicken or\nnot. However, traditional deep learning models require large amounts of data to\ntrain on, which in this case these amounts of data were challenging to collect\nespecially the images of non-halal slaughtered chicken, hence this paper shows\nhow the use of one shot learning [1] and transfer learning [2] can reach high\naccuracy on the few amounts of data that were available. The architecture used\nis based on the Siamese neural networks architecture which ranks the similarity\nbetween two inputs [3] while using the Xception network [4] as the twin\nnetworks. We call it HalalNet. This work was done as part of SYCUT (syriah\ncompliant slaughtering system) which is a monitoring system that monitors the\nhalalness of the slaughtered chicken in a slaughter house. The data used to\ntrain and validate HalalNet was collected from the Azain slaughtering site\n(Semenyih, Selangor, Malaysia) containing images of both halal and non-halal\nslaughtered chicken.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 06:55:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-03"}

They\nare best detectable when viewed against uniform backgrounds and can persist for\nmultiple seconds. Consequently, the dynamics of afterimages appears to be slow\nby their very nature. To the contrary, we report here that about 50% of an\nafterimage intensity can be erased rapidly--within less than a second. The\nprerequisite is that subjects view a rich visual content to erase the\nafterimage; fast erasure of afterimages does not occur if subjects view a blank\nscreen. Moreover, we find evidence that fast removal of afterimages is a skill\nlearned with practice as our subjects were always more effective in cleaning up\nafterimages in later parts of the experiment. These results can be explained by\na tri-level hierarchy of adaptive mechanisms, as has been proposed by the\ntheory of practopoiesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 06:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-02"}

One of the most recently\nintroduced network optimization problems is the Clustered Shortest-Path Tree\nProblem (CluSTP). Since the problem is NP-Hard, recent approaches often prefer\nto use approximation algorithms to solve it, several of which used Evolutionary\nAlgorithms (EAs) and have been proven to be effective. However, most of the\nprior studies directly applied EAs to the whole CluSTP problem, which leads to\na great amount of resource consumption, especially when the problem size is\nlarge. To overcome these limitations, this paper suggests a method for reducing\nthe search space of the EAs applied to CluSTP by decomposing the original\nproblem into two sub-problems, the solution to one of which is found by an EAs\nand that to the other is found by another method. The goal of the first\nsub-problem is to determine a spanning tree which connects among the clusters,\nwhile the goal of the second sub-problem is to determine the best spanning tree\nfor each cluster. In addition, this paper proposes a new EAs, which can be\napplied to solve the first sub-problem and suggests using the Dijkstra's\nalgorithm to solve the second sub-problem. The proposed approach is\ncomprehensively experimented and compared with existing methods. Experimental\nresults prove that our method is more efficient and more importantly, it can\nobtain results which are close to the optimal results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 03:56:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}
