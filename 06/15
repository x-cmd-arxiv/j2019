Using the optimal\nPauli conjugation, we can achieve a higher logical fidelity than using twirling\nand doing nothing.

The approach, however, is computationally\nintensive for large data sets, due to the need to operate on a dense $n \\times\nn$ kernel matrix, where $n$ is the sample size. Recently, various approximation\nschemes for solving KRR have been considered, and some analyzed. Some\napproaches such as Nystr\\\"{o}m approximation and sketching have been shown to\npreserve the rate optimality of KRR. In this paper, we consider the simplest\napproximation, namely, spectrally truncating the kernel matrix to its largest\n$r < n$ eigenvalues. We derive an exact expression for the maximum risk of this\ntruncated KRR, over the unit ball of the RKHS. This result can be used to study\nthe exact trade-off between the level of spectral truncation and the\nregularization parameter.

It is capable of detecting barcodes of any type simultaneously both\nin the document scans and in the wild by means of a single model. The detector\nachieves state-of-the-art results on the ArTe-Lab 1D Medium Barcode Dataset\nwith detection rate 0.995. Moreover, developed detector can deal with more\ncomplicated object shapes like very long but narrow or very small barcodes. The\nproposed approach can also identify types of detected barcodes and performs at\nreal-time speed on CPU environment being much faster than previous\nstate-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 16:44:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 07:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-19"}

The scaling\nsolution accurately reproduces universal properties of the transition.

The velocity centroid maps may allow for more robust\nindirect detections of embedded planets. The non-Keplerian velocity along the\nplanetary wakes undergoes an abrupt sign reversal across the protoplanet. After\nsubtraction of the disk rotation curve, the location of the perturber should be\nidentifiable as a Doppler-flip in velocity centroid maps.

We\nconduct large scale experiments on MNIST and CIFAR datasets, and outperform all\nprevious linear relaxation and bound propagation based certified defenses in\n$\\ell_\\infty$ robustness. Notably, we achieve 7.02% verified test error on\nMNIST at $\\epsilon=0.3$, and 66.94% on CIFAR-10 with $\\epsilon=8/255$.

The\nkey challenges are how to efficiently explore the state space and how to decide\nwhen to stop exploring in conjunction with the function approximation scheme.\n  The current paper presents a provably efficient algorithm for $Q$-learning\nwith linear function approximation. Under certain regularity assumptions, our\nalgorithm, Difference Maximization $Q$-learning (DMQ), combined with linear\nfunction approximation, returns a near-optimal policy using a polynomial number\nof trajectories.

The addition of tidal shear\ninformation does not yield an improved halo collapse model over one based on\ndensity information alone; the difference in their predictive performance is\nconsistent with the statistical uncertainty of the density-only based model.\nThis implies that our machine learning setup does not identify any significant\nrole for the tidal shear in determining halo masses.

While for\nlaboratory plasmas these characteristics are derived from the gas density and\ntemperature, such recipes can be fundamentally different for the intergalactic\nplasma due to a low rate of particle collisions and a weak magnetic field. In\nnumerical simulations, one often cuts through these unknowns by modeling these\nplasmas as hydrodynamic fluids, even though local, non-hydrodynamic features\nobserved in clusters contradict this assumption. Using deep Chandra\nobservations of the Coma Cluster, we probe gas fluctuations in intergalactic\nmedium down to spatial scales where the transport processes should prominently\nmanifest themselves - at least if hydrodynamic models with pure Coulomb\ncollision rates were indeed adequate. We find that they do not, implying that\nthe effective isotropic viscosity is orders of magnitude smaller than naively\nexpected. This indicates an enhanced collision rate in the plasma due to\nparticle scattering off microfluctuations caused by plasma instabilities, or\nthat the transport processes are anisotropic with respect to local magnetic\nfield. For that reason, numerical models with high Reynolds number appear more\nconsistent with observations.

While this has inspired many strategies to tailor the rheology in\nthese systems, in the more general case, viz-a-viz suspensions of anisotropic\nparticles, the mechanism of shear-thickening remains unclear. Here through\nsimultaneous measurements of the bulk viscosity and the first Normal stress\ndifference, we show that strong shear thickening in suspensions of colloidal\nrods is accompanied by large positive normal stresses, indicating the formation\nof a system-spanning frictional contact network. We also find that flow in the\nshear-thickening regime is unsteady and shows a rather rich time-dependence. By\ncarrying out single particle-resolved confocal rheology measurements, we\nprovide compelling evidence that this rheological chaos arises from a strong\ncoupling between the imposed flow and particle orientational order. Building on\nthese observations, we designed colloidal rods with temperature-tunable\ntribological properties and demonstrate the feasibility of achieving in-situ\ncontrol over suspension rheology. These findings show that the interplay\nbetween orientational order and frictional interactions plays a critical role\nin the shear thickening of dense suspensions of colloidal rods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 18:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

The winglet was mounted\nnormally to a flat surface with an angle to the oncoming flow. A parametric\nstudy varying the winglet height (constant aspect ratio) and angle has shown,\ncontrary to the common classical single tip-vortex conception, that the wake\ngenerally consists of a complex system of multiple vortex structures. The\nprimary vortex has previously been discovered to contain a direct coupling\nbetween the axial and the rotational flow. In the current work, even the\nlongitudinal secondary structures detected from measured streamwise vorticity\ndisplay similar behavior. A regime map depicting the observed stable far wake\nstates of the multiple vortices as a function of winglet height and angle\nreveals complex patterns of the flow topologies not only with the primary tip\nvortex, but with the additional secondary structures as well. A bifurcation\ndiagram shows distinct regimes of the various secondary structures as well as\nhow the primary vortex is in some cases significantly affected by their\npresence. These data should serve as inspiration in the process of generating\nlongitudinal vortices for enhancement of heat and mass transfer in industrial\ndevices since the multiple vortex regimes can help improve the conditions for\nthese exchanges. Further, these results point to a weakness in existing\ninviscid models not accounting for the possibility of multiple vortical\nstructures in the wake.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 21:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

Our experimental results using\ndatasets from the computer vision and medical imaging domains---Street View\nHouse Numbers, CIFAR-10, and Chest X-Ray datasets---demonstrate competitive\nperformance against state-of-the-art semi-supervised models both in image\ngeneration and classification tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 23:04:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

In biofilms of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, we\nrecently discovered that some, but not all, cells participate in the\npropagation of an electrical signal, and the ones that do are organized in a\nway that is statistically consistent with percolation theory. However, two key\nassumptions of percolation theory are violated in this system. First, we find\nhere that the probability for a cell to signal is not independent from other\ncells but instead is correlated with its nearby neighbors. We develop a\nmechanistic model, in which correlated signaling emerges from cell division,\nphenotypic inheritance, and cell displacement, that reproduces the experimental\nresults. Second, we observed previously that the fraction of signaling cells is\nnot constant but instead varies from biofilm to biofilm. We use our model to\nunderstand why percolation theory remains a valid description of the system\ndespite these two violations of its assumptions. We find that the first\nviolation does not significantly affect the spatial statistics, which we\nrationalize using a renormalization argument. We find that the second violation\nwidens the range of signaling fractions around the percolation threshold at\nwhich one observes the characteristic power-law statistics of cluster sizes,\nconsistent with our previous experimental results. We validate our model using\na mutant biofilm whose signaling probability decays along the propagation\ndirection.

Jacobian-free iterative approaches such as Arnoldi\nmethods have greatly alleviated the required computational burden. However,\noperations such as orthonormalization and shift-and-invert transformation of\nmatrices with appropriate shift guesses can stll introduce computational and\nparameter-dependent costs that inhibit their routine application to general\nthree-dimensional flowfields. The present work addresses these limitations by\nproposing and implementing a robust, generalizable approach to extract the\nprincipal global modes, suited for curvilinear coordinates as well as the\neffects of compressibility. Accurate linearized perturbation snapshots are\nobtained using high-order schemes by leveraging the same non-linear\nNavier-Stokes code as used to obtain the basic state by appropriately\nconstraining the equations using a body-force. It is shown that with random\nimpulse forcing, dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) of the subspace formed by\nthese products yields the desired physically meaningful modes when\nappropriately scaled. The leading eigenmodes are thus obtained without spurious\nmodes or the need for an iterative procedure. Further, since orthonormalization\nis not required, large subspaces can be processed to capture converged low\nfrequency or stationary modes. The validity and versatility of the method are\ndemonstrated with numerous examples encompassing essential elements expected in\nrealistic flows, such as compressibility effects and complicated domains\nrequiring general curvilinear meshes. Favorable comparisons with Arnoldi-based\nmethod, complemented with substantial savings in computational resources show\nthe potential of the current approach for relatively complex flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2019 04:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-13"}

However, this\nreliability comes at a cost: it can be challenging to write new prototypes in\n(or migrate old code to) dependently-typed programming languages. Gradual\ntyping makes static type disciplines more flexible, so an appropriate notion of\ngradual dependent types could fruitfully lower this cost. However, dependent\ntypes raise unique challenges for gradual typing. Dependent typechecking\ninvolves the execution of program code, but gradually-typed code can signal\nruntime type errors or diverge. These runtime errors threaten the soundness\nguarantees that make dependent types so attractive, while divergence spoils the\ntype-driven programming experience.\n  This paper presents GDTL, a gradual dependently-typed language that\nemphasizes pragmatic dependently-typed programming. GDTL fully embeds both an\nuntyped and dependently-typed language, and allows for smooth transitions\nbetween the two. In addition to gradual types we introduce gradual terms ,\nwhich allow the user to be imprecise in type indices and to omit proof terms;\nruntime checks ensure type safety . To account for nontermination and failure,\nwe distinguish between compile-time normalization and run-time execution:\ncompile-time normalization is approximate but total, while runtime execution is\nexact , but may fail or diverge. We prove that GDTL has decidable typechecking\nand satisfies all the expected properties of gradual languages. In particular,\nGDTL satisfies the static and dynamic gradual guarantees: reducing type\nprecision preserves typedness, and altering type precision does not change\nprogram behavior outside of dynamic type failures. To prove these properties,\nwe were led to establish a novel normalization gradual guarantee that captures\nthe monotonicity of approximate normalization with respect to imprecision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2019 04:49:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 15:29:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 11:07:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-23"}

Low torque servos were\nemployed in the beginning of the assembly and were controlled with the Arduino\nUno micro controller. Findings- The versatility of legged robots require\nmaterials with high strength to weight ratio, where 3003 aluminium alloy sheets\nproved to be a better choice than conventional ABS.

Many recent approaches are based\non Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) which model human poses with exponential\nmaps. These approaches neglect the pose velocity as well as temporal relation\nof different poses, and tend to converge to the mean pose or fail to generate\nnatural-looking poses. We therefore propose a novel Position-Velocity Recurrent\nEncoder-Decoder (PVRED) for human motion prediction, which makes full use of\npose velocities and temporal positional information. A temporal position\nembedding method is presented and a Position-Velocity RNN (PVRNN) is proposed.\nWe also emphasize the benefits of quaternion parameterization of poses and\ndesign a novel trainable Quaternion Transformation (QT) layer, which is\ncombined with a robust loss function during training.

While these effects can\neasily be estimated within a harmonic approximation, corrections arising from\nthe anharmonic nature of the interatomic potential are often crucial and\nrequire computationally costly path integral simulations. Consequently,\ndifferent approximate frameworks for computing affordable estimates of the\nanharmonic free energies have been developed over the years. Understanding\nwhich of the approximations involved are justified for a given system is\ncomplicated by the lack of comparative benchmarks. To facilitate this choice we\nassess the accuracy and efficiency of some of the commonly used approximate\nmethods -- the vibrational self-consistent field and self-consistent phonons --\nby comparing the anharmonic correction to the Helmholtz free energy against\nreference path integral calculations. These benchmarks are performed for a\ndiverse set of systems, ranging from simple quasi-harmonic solids to flexible\nmolecular crystals with freely-rotating units. Our results suggest that for\nsimple solids such as allotropes of carbon these methods yield results that are\nin excellent agreement with the reference calculations, at a considerably lower\ncomputational cost. For more complex molecular systems such as polymorphs of\nice and paracetamol the methods do not consistently provide a reliable\napproximation of the anharmonic correction. Despite substantial cancellation of\nerrors when comparing the stability of different phases, we do not observe a\nsystematic improvement over the harmonic approximation even for relative\nfree-energies. Our results suggest that efforts towards obtaining\ncomputationally-feasible anharmonic free-energies for flexible molecular solids\nshould therefore be directed towards reducing the expense of path integral\nmethods\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2019 10:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

Recent studies have mostly focused on developing deep learning\napproaches to learn a compact graph embedding, upon which classic clustering\nmethods like k-means or spectral clustering algorithms are applied. These\ntwo-step frameworks are difficult to manipulate and usually lead to suboptimal\nperformance, mainly because the graph embedding is not goal-directed, i.e.,\ndesigned for the specific clustering task. In this paper, we propose a\ngoal-directed deep learning approach, Deep Attentional Embedded Graph\nClustering (DAEGC for short). Our method focuses on attributed graphs to\nsufficiently explore the two sides of information in graphs. By employing an\nattention network to capture the importance of the neighboring nodes to a\ntarget node, our DAEGC algorithm encodes the topological structure and node\ncontent in a graph to a compact representation, on which an inner product\ndecoder is trained to reconstruct the graph structure. Furthermore, soft labels\nfrom the graph embedding itself are generated to supervise a self-training\ngraph clustering process, which iteratively refines the clustering results. The\nself-training process is jointly learned and optimized with the graph embedding\nin a unified framework, to mutually benefit both components. Experimental\nresults compared with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the superiority\nof our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2019 11:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

There exists a critical ratio of the imitators in the\npopulation, below which cooperation is suppressed while above which cooperation\nis promoted. With the coevolving of individual strategies and preferred project\nscales, a higher level of cooperation corresponds to a larger average value of\nthe preferred project scales. A theoretical analysis indicates that, as most of\nthe individuals are mutants, the coevolving process is governed by the mutation\nprocess, which leads to a smaller average value of the preferred project scales\nand a lower level of cooperation. As most of the individuals are imitators, the\ncoevolving process is governed by the coupling of the mutation and imitation\nprocesses, which leads to a larger average value of the preferred project\nscales and a higher level of cooperation. As all the individuals are imitators,\nthe coevolving process is governed by the imitation process, which leads to an\nintermediate average value of the preferred project scales and an intermediate\nlevel of cooperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2019 13:22:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 08:38:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Computational hermeneutics\nharnesses recent progresses in automated reasoning for higher-order logics and\naims at formalizing natural-language argumentative discourse using flexible\ncombinations of expressive non-classical logics. In doing so, it allows us to\nrender explicit the tacit conceptualizations implicit in argumentative\ndiscursive practices. Our approach operates on networks of structured arguments\nand is iterative and two-layered. At one layer we search for logically correct\nformalizations for each of the individual arguments. At the next layer we\nselect among those correct formalizations the ones which honor the argument's\ndialectic role, i.e. attacking or supporting other arguments as intended. We\noperate at these two layers in parallel and continuously rate sentences'\nformalizations by using, primarily, inferential adequacy criteria. An\ninterpretive, logical theory will thus gradually evolve. This theory is\ncomposed of meaning postulates serving as explications for concepts playing a\nrole in the analyzed arguments.

They offer\nsignificant advantages with respect to conventional cameras: high temporal\nresolution, high dynamic range, and no motion blur. While the stream of events\nencodes in principle the complete visual signal, the reconstruction of an\nintensity image from a stream of events is an ill-posed problem in practice.\nExisting reconstruction approaches are based on hand-crafted priors and strong\nassumptions about the imaging process as well as the statistics of natural\nimages. In this work we propose to learn to reconstruct intensity images from\nevent streams directly from data instead of relying on any hand-crafted priors.\nWe propose a novel recurrent network to reconstruct videos from a stream of\nevents, and train it on a large amount of simulated event data.

In this work, we present optimization-based approaches to model\ncooperation and competition between multiple ridesharing companies, in a\nreal-time on-demand setting. A recent trend relies on solving the integrated\ncombination of Dial-A-Ride Problems (DARP), which compute the cost of assigning\nincoming requests to vehicle routes, plus Linear Assignment Problems (LAP),\nwhich assign vehicles to requests. While the DARPs, are solved at the level of\nthe vehicles of each company, we introduce cooperative and competitive\napproaches to solve the LAP.
