The drag as a function of depth is observed to decrease from being\nquadratic at low speeds to appearing more linear at higher speeds. By scaling\nthe drag with the average weight of the grains acting on the rod, we obtain the\neffective friction $\\mu_e$ encountered over six orders of magnitude of speeds.\nWhile a constant $\\mu_e$ is found when the grain size, rod depth and fluid\nviscosity are varied at low speeds, a systematic increase is observed as the\nspeed is increased.

Observational mm-VLBI campaigns are\ncapable of resolving the jet-launching region at the scale of the event\nhorizon. In order to provide a context for interpreting these observations,\nrealistic general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) models of the\naccretion flow are constructed. The characteristics of the observed\nspectral-energy distribution (SED) depend on the shape of the electrons'\nenergy-distribution function (eDF). The dependency on the eDF is omitted in the\nmodeling of the first Event Horizon Telescope results. In this work, we aim to\nmodel the M 87 SED from radio up to NIR/optical frequencies using a\nthermal-relativistic Maxwell- J\\\"uttner distribution, as well as a relativistic\n$\\kappa$-distribution function. The electrons are injected based on sub-grid,\nparticle-in-cell parametrizations for sub-relativistic reconnection. A GRMHD\nsimulation in Cartesian-Kerr-Schild coordinates, using eight levels of adaptive\nmesh refinement (AMR), forms the basis of our model. To obtain spectra and\nimages, the GRMHD data is post-processed with the ray-tracing code RAPTOR,\nwhich is capable of ray tracing through AMR GRMHD simulation data.

Studying such questions\nnot only gives detailed insight into the structure of the problem itself, but\nalso into the complexity of related problems; most notably graph theory's core\nnotion of critical graphs (e.g., graphs whose chromatic number decreases under\ndeletion of an arbitrary edge) and the complexity-theoretic notion of\nminimality problems (also called criticality problems, e.g., recognizing graphs\nthat become 3-colorable when an arbitrary edge is deleted).\n  We focus on two prototypical graph problems, Colorability and Vertex Cover.\nFor example, we show that it is NP-hard to compute an optimal coloring for a\ngraph from optimal colorings for all its one-vertex-deleted subgraphs, and that\nthis remains true even when optimal solutions for all one-edge-deleted\nsubgraphs are given.

I show\nthat the relative size of the money market (that is, relative to the Kelly\nbankroll) is a martingale that nonetheless converges in probability to zero.\nThe margin loan interest rate is a submartingale that converges in mean square\nto the choke price $r_\\infty:=\\nu-\\sigma^2/2$, where $\\nu$ is the asymptotic\ncompound growth rate of the stock market and $\\sigma$ is its annual volatility.\nIn this environment, the gambler no longer beats the market asymptotically a.s.\nby an exponential factor (as he would under perfectly elastic supply).

As a\ngeneralized face verification task, visual kinship verification is particularly\ndifficult with low-quality found Internet data. Due to uncontrolled variations\nin background, pose, facial expression, blur, illumination and occlusion,\nstate-of-the-art methods fail to provide high level of recognition accuracy. As\nwith many other visual recognition tasks, kinship verification may benefit from\ncombining visual and audio signals. However, voice-based kinship verification\nhas received very little prior attention. We hypothesize that the human voice\ncontains kin-related cues that are complementary to visual cues. In this paper,\nwe address, for the first time, the use of audio-visual information from face\nand voice modalities to perform kinship verification. We first propose a new\nmulti-modal kinship dataset, called TALking KINship (TALKIN), that contains\nseveral pairs of Internet-quality video sequences. Using TALKIN, we then study\nthe utility of various kinship verification methods including traditional local\nfeature based methods, statistical methods and more recent deep learning\napproaches. Then, early and late fusion methods are evaluated on the TALKIN\ndataset for the study of kinship verification with both face and voice\nmodalities. Finally, we propose a deep Siamese fusion network with contrastive\nloss for multi-modal fusion of kinship relations. Extensive experiments on the\nTALKIN dataset indicate that by combining face and voice modalities, the\nproposed Siamese network can provide a significantly higher level of accuracy\ncompared to baseline uni-modal and multi-modal fusion techniques.

We extend the options framework by adding a dynamics model and the\nuse of a nearness-to-goal heuristic, derived from demonstrations. This\ntranslates the optimization of a hierarchical policy controller to a problem of\nplanning with a model predictive controller. By unrolling the dynamics of each\noption and assessing the expected value of each future state, we can create a\nsimple switching controller for choosing the optimal policy within a\nconstrained time horizon similarly to hill climbing heuristic search.

Most of the inferred SN Ia yields are consistent with\nall of the theoretical models, but [Ni/Fe] is consistent only with sub-M_Ch\nmodels. We conclude that the dominant type of SN Ia in ancient dwarf galaxies\nis the explosion of a sub-M_Ch white dwarf.

The\nubiquitous presence of the pseudo-gap phase in under-doped cuprates suggests\nthat its understanding holds a key in unraveling the origin of high temperature\nsuperconductivity. In this paper, we review various theoretical approaches to\nthis problem, with a special emphasis on the concept of emergent symmetries in\nthe under-doped region of those compounds. We differentiate the theories by\nconsidering a few fundamental questions related to the rich phenomenology of\nthese materials. Lastly we discuss a recent idea of two kinds of entangled\npreformed pairs which open a gap at the pseudo-gap onset temperature $T^{*}$\nthrough a specific Higgs mechanism.

The host stellar\nsystem consists of three mid-to-late M dwarfs in a hierarchical configuration,\nwhich are blended in one TESS pixel. We use data from MEarth and results from\nthe SPOC DV report to determine that the planet transits the primary star in\nthe system. The planet has a radius 1.38 R_Earth, an orbital period of 5.35882\ndays, and an equilibrium temperature of 433 K. With radial velocities from\nHARPS, we place a three-sigma upper mass limit of 8.4 M_Earth on the candidate.\nThe planet provides one of the best opportunities to date for the spectroscopic\nstudy of the atmosphere of a terrestrial world.

For static droplets, the pressure difference\n$P_{\\varepsilon, in} - P_{\\varepsilon, out}$ satisfies the Young-Laplace law\nfor droplet radius greater than $3.5\\varepsilon$ and otherwise deviates from\nthe Young-Laplace law. The latter indicates that the surface tension in the\nproposed model decreases with decreasing radius of curvature, which agrees with\nmolecular dynamics and experimental studies of nanodroplets. Using the\nnon-local model we perform numerical simulations of droplets under dynamic\nconditions, including a rising droplet, a droplet in shear flow, and two\ncolliding droplets in shear flow, and compare results with a standard\nNavier-Stokes model subject to the Young-Laplace boundary condition at the\nfluid-fluid interface implemented via the Conservative Level Set (CLS) method.\nWe find good agreement with existing numerical methods and analytical results\nfor a rising macroscopic droplet and a droplet in a shear flow.

Traditionally, such acquisitions required specialized\nreconstructions involving phase compensation to correct for inter-shot motion\nartifacts. The recently proposed MUSSELS reconstruction belongs to a new class\nof parallel imaging-based methods that recover artifact-free DWIs from msDW\ndata without needing phase compensation. However, computational demands of the\nMUSSELS reconstruction scales as the matrix size and the number of shots\nincreases, which hinders its practical utility for high-resolution\napplications.

However, subsequent research showed that this is biased\ntowards selecting covariates with more potential split points. Therefore,\nunbiased recursive partitioning algorithms have been suggested (e.g., QUEST,\nGUIDE, CTree, MOB) that first select the covariate based on statistical\ninference using p-values that are adjusted for the possible split points. In a\nsecond step a split point optimizing some objective function is selected in the\nchosen split variable.

Traditional skill learning has revolved\naround reinforcement and imitation learning, each with rigid constraints on the\nformat of information exchanged between the human and the agent. While scalar\nrewards carry little information, demonstrations require significant effort to\nprovide and may carry more information than is necessary. Furthermore, rewards\nand demonstrations are often defined and collected before training begins, when\nthe human is most uncertain about what information would help the agent. In\ncontrast, when humans communicate objectives with each other, they make use of\na large vocabulary of informative behaviors, including non-verbal\ncommunication, and often communicate throughout learning, responding to\nobserved behavior. In this way, humans communicate intent with minimal effort.\nIn this paper, we propose such interactive learning as an alternative to reward\nor demonstration-driven learning. To accomplish this, we introduce a\nmulti-agent training framework that enables an agent to learn from another\nagent who knows the current task. Through a series of experiments, we\ndemonstrate the emergence of a variety of interactive learning behaviors,\nincluding information-sharing, information-seeking, and question-answering.\nMost importantly, we find that our approach produces an agent that is capable\nof learning interactively from a human user, without a set of explicit\ndemonstrations or a reward function, and achieving significantly better\nperformance cooperatively with a human than a human performing the task alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 19:23:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 23:07:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 21:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

In particular, we\nfound that the different spin channels are affected differently because of the\npresence of the spin-polarized point defect, and that localisation of the\nwavefunction, the geometry of the defect and the electron-electron interaction\nare all important ingredients to describe high-harmonic generation in\ndefected-solids. We show that different vacancies lead to qualitatively\ndifferent effects, thus opening the door to the high-harmonic imaging of\nspin-polarised defects in solids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 20:38:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 08:15:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2020 11:40:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

The\nlimiting factor in large-scale bolometric searches for this rare process is the\nbackground induced by surface radioactive contamination, as shown by the\nresults of the CUORE experiment. The basic concept of CROSS consists of\nrejecting this challenging background component by pulse-shape discrimination,\nassisted by a proper coating of the faces of the crystal containing the isotope\nof interest and serving as energy absorber of the bolometric detector.

We\ndiscuss aspects affecting the accuracy of the identification and show that\nalready the small spectral range of 1700-1300 cm$^{-1}$ leads to similar\nsuccess in differentiating between polymer types with near-field data as with\nconventional far-field FTIR spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 21:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

If G is disconnected, we define a\nbroadcast on G as the union of broadcasts on its components.

In\nthis paper we focus instead on procedures involving the shortest cycles:\nbilateral swap-deals. In such swap dynamics, the agents perform pairwise\nmutually improving deals until reaching a swap-stable allocation (no improving\nswap-deal is possible). We prove that in the single-peaked domain every\nswap-stable allocation is Pareto-optimal, showing the efficiency of the swap\ndynamics. In fact, this domain turns out to be maximal when it comes to\nguaranteeing this property. Besides, both the outcome of TTC and Crawler can\nalways be reached by sequences of swaps. However, some Pareto-optimal\nallocations are not reachable through improving swap-deals. We further analyze\nthe outcome of swap dynamics through social welfare notions, in our context the\naverage or minimum rank of the resources obtained by agents in the final\nallocation. We start by providing a worst-case analysis of these procedures.\nFinally, we present an extensive experimental study in which different versions\nof swap dynamics are compared to other existing allocation procedures.

When the domain of the problem is large (e.g.\ntraversal of a high-dimensional space), a perfect solution cannot be obtained,\nso approximations must be made. These approximations often lead to a reported\nquantity of interest (QOI) which varies between runs, decreasing the confidence\nof any single run. When the algorithm further computes this final QOI based on\nuncertain or noisy data, the variability (or lack of confidence) of the final\nQOI increases. Unbounded, these two sources of uncertainty (algorithmic\napproximations and uncertainty in input data) can result in a reported\nstatistic that has low correlation with ground truth.\n  In biological applications, this is especially applicable, as the search\nspace is generally approximated at least to some degree (e.g. a high percentage\nof protein structures are invalid or energetically unfavorable) and the\nexplicit conversion from continuous to discrete space for protein\nrepresentation implies some uncertainty in the input data.

We create\nfour hypothetical universes where every black hole born in the collapse of a\nmassive star has a dimensionless Kerr spin parameter, $\\chi_{\\rm birth}$, of\n0.0, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.5. We show that if all stellar-born black holes are\nnon-spinning ($\\chi_{\\rm birth} = 0.0$), then more than 10% of merging binary\nblack holes from clusters have components formed from previous mergers,\naccounting for more than 20% of the mergers from globular clusters detectable\nby LIGO/Virgo. Furthermore, nearly 7% of detectable mergers would have a\ncomponent with a mass $\\gtrsim 55M_{\\odot}$, placing them clearly in the mass\n\"gap\" region where black holes cannot form from isolated collapsing stars due\nto the pulsational-pair instability mechanism. On the other hand, if black\nholes are born spinning, then the contribution from these second-generation\nmergers decreases, making up as little as 1% of all detections from globular\nclusters when $\\chi_{\\rm birth} = 0.5$. We make quantitative predictions for\nthe detected masses, mass ratios, and spin properties of first- and\nsecond-generation mergers from dense star clusters, and show how these\ndistributions are highly sensitive to the birth spins of black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 22:49:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Aug 2019 13:32:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

In this paper, we focus on the\nreliability of 5G transport-network slices in EON.

This is done by employing peer-to-peer data\ntransfers to supplement the resources of the network infrastructure. However,\nthese hybrid systems are vulnerable to accounting attacks in which the peers,\nor caches, collude with clients in order to report that content was transferred\nwhen it was not. This is a particular issue in systems that incentivize cache\nparticipation, because malicious caches may collect rewards from the content\npublishers operating the CDN without doing any useful work.\n  In this paper, we introduce CAPnet, the first technique that lets untrusted\ncaches join a peer-assisted CDN while providing a bound on the effectiveness of\naccounting attacks. At its heart is a lightweight cache accountability puzzle\nthat clients must solve before caches are given credit. This puzzle requires\ncolocating the data a client has requested, so its solution confirms that the\ncontent (or at least an amount of data within a pre-configured bound) has\nactually been retrieved. We analyze the security and overhead of our scheme in\nrealistic scenarios. The results show that a modest client machine using a\nsingle core can solve puzzles at a rate sufficient to simultaneously watch\ndozens of 1080p videos. The technique is designed to be even more scalable on\nthe server side. In our experiments, one core of a single low-end machine is\nable to generate puzzles for 4.26 Tbps of bandwidth - enabling 870,000 clients\nto concurrently view the same 1080p video.

The proof-of-principle experiments show that a dynamic range of\napproximately 10^11 compared with the noise level, a time resolution of\napproximately 160 fs, and a time window of 65 ps can be successfully obtained\nusing the novel single-shot fourth-order auto-correlator, which is the highest\ndynamic range with simultaneous high time resolution for single-shot temporal\ncontrast measurement so far. Furthermore, the temporal contrast of laser pulse\nfrom a PW laser system is successfully measured in single-shot with a dynamic\nrange of about 2*10^10 and simultaneous a time resolution of 160 fs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2019 02:55:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 02:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

These rigid data retrieval mechanisms pose\nhurdles for non-expert users, who typically lack language expertise and are\nunfamiliar with the details of the schema. Query by Example (QBE) methods offer\nan alternative mechanism: users provide examples of their intended query output\nand the QBE system needs to infer the intended query. However, these approaches\nfocus on the structural similarity of the examples and ignore the richer\ncontext present in the data. As a result, they typically produce queries that\nare too general, and fail to capture the user's intent effectively. In this\npaper, we present SQuID, a system that performs semantic similarity-aware query\nintent discovery. Our work makes the following contributions: (1) We design an\nend-to-end system that automatically formulates select-project-join queries in\nan open-world setting, with optional group-by aggregation and intersection\noperators; a much larger class than prior QBE techniques.

HIVE-COTE combines\nmultiple types of classifiers: each extracting information about a specific\naspect of a time series, be it in the time domain, frequency domain or\nsummarization of intervals within the series.

Most state-of-the-art approaches prune the model in filter-level\naccording to the \"importance\" of filters. Despite their success, we notice they\nsuffer from at least two of the following problems: 1) The redundancy among\nfilters is not considered because the importance is evaluated independently. 2)\nCross-layer filter comparison is unachievable since the importance is defined\nlocally within each layer. Consequently, we must manually specify layer-wise\npruning ratios. 3) They are prone to generate sub-optimal solutions because\nthey neglect the inequality between reducing parameters and reducing\ncomputational cost. Reducing the same number of parameters in different\npositions in the network may reduce different computational cost. To address\nthe above problems, we develop a novel algorithm named as COP\n(correlation-based pruning), which can detect the redundant filters\nefficiently. We enable the cross-layer filter comparison through global\nnormalization. We add parameter-quantity and computational-cost regularization\nterms to the importance, which enables the users to customize the compression\naccording to their preference (smaller or faster).

In PQE, only a small part of the formula is taken out of the\nscope of quantifiers. The appeal of PQE is that many verification problems,\ne.g. equivalence checking and model checking, reduce to PQE and the latter is\nmuch easier than complete QE. Earlier, we introduced a PQE algorithm based on\nthe machinery of D-sequents. A D-sequent is a record stating that a clause is\nredundant in a quantified CNF formula in a specified subspace. To make this\nalgorithm efficient, it is important to reuse learned D-sequents. However,\nreusing D-sequents is not as easy as conflict clauses in SAT-solvers because\nredundancy is a structural rather than a semantic property. Earlier, we\nmodified the definition of D-sequents to enable their safe reusing. In this\npaper, we present a PQE algorithm based on new D-sequents. It is different from\nits predecessor in two aspects. First, the new algorithm can learn and reuse\nD-sequents. Second, it proves clauses redundant one by one and thus backtracks\nas soon as the current target clause is proved redundant in the current\nsubspace. This makes the new PQE algorithm similar to a SAT-solver that\nbacktracks as soon as just one clause is falsified.

A special\ncase of this kind of leakage is the EB-leakage in detection of the cosmological\ngravitational wave background (CGWB). I first give the general solutions for\nall integral transforms, prove that they are the best solutions, and then apply\nthem to the case of EB-leakage and detection of the CGWB.

One factor which governs the behaviour of a material, under a given\ncondition, is the microstructure. Despite the absence of any phase\ntransformation, a change in the microstructure would significantly alter the\nproperties. Therefore, a substantial understanding on the stability of the\nmicrostructure is vital to avert any unexpected catastrophic change in the\nmaterial properties. In the present work, one such numerical approach called\nphase-field modelling in employed to analyse the stability of two- and\nthree-dimensional finite structures, which dictate the curvature-driven\nevolution of the microstructure. A characteristic feature of this numerical\napproach is the introduction of a scalar variable, called the phase field, in\naddition to the other thermodynamic variables. While the inclusion of the phase\nfield obviates the need for the interface tracking, which is a strenuous aspect\nof the other conventional techniques, it replaces the sharp interface with a\nfinite diffuse region. Therefore, before adopting and extending the phase-field\ntechnique, it is shown that the model recovers the governing law, i.e,\nGibbs-Thomson relation, despite the introduction of the diffuse interface.\nSubsequently, the numerical treatment is employed to investigate the\nvolume-diffusion governed curvature-induced transformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2019 09:21:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

The\nchannel states are modeled by stochastic processes with joint distributions\nknown to users. However, the exact state of a channel at any time is not\nobservable. We first consider two channel models: (i) the fast time-varying\nchannel model (where the channel states are assumed to be independent and\nidentically distributed in each time slot), and (ii) the slow time-varying\nchannel model (where the channel states remain unchanged over time). Among the\nclasses of the blind rendezvous policies that randomly hop on channels\naccording to certain channel selection probabilities, we show the optimal\nchannel selection policy that minimizes the expected time-to-rendezvous (ETTR)\nis the single selection policy that hops on the ``best'' channel all the time\nin the fast time-varying channel model. However, for the slow time-varying\nchannel model, it is much more difficult to find the optimal channel selection\npolicy. By using the majorization ordering, we derive a lower bound and an\nupper bound for the ETTR under the assumption that the channel states are\nexchangeable random variables. Bases on these bounds, we then prove various\napproximation solutions. We then extend our results to general channel models\nwhere the joint distribution of the channel states is only assumed to be\nstationary in time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2019 09:56:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

These measures allow comparing two detectors in terms of the\nrelative sample sizes they require to achieve the same prescribed level of\nfalse alarm and detection probabilities. While the finite-sample-size measure\nRE is useful to analyze the small sample behavior of detectors, in practice it\nis difficult to compute. In the limit as the signal strength approaches zero at\nan appropriate rate, the RE converges to an asymptotic limit only for very\nlarge sample sizes. This limiting ratio of the number of samples is the ARE,\nwhich lends analytical tractability, but does not provide insights into the\nfinite sample behavior of detectors which is important for practical\napplications. This led researchers to study the convergence of RE to ARE, and\nhas been well-reported for the problem of constant signal detection in\nadditive, independent, and identically distributed noise.

The wireless bridge is also demonstrated in\na wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) scenario, where 5 optical channels are\ngenerated and sent to the Tx remote antenna unit (RAU). In this configuration,\nthe full band from 224 GHz to 294 GHz is used. Finally, a 50 Gbit/s\ntransmission is achieved with the proposed wireless bridge in single channel\nconfiguration. The wireless transmission distance is limited to 10 cm due to\nthe low power emitted by the uni-travelling carrier photodiode used in the\nexperiments.

Scaling relations between cluster properties embody the formation\nand evolution of cosmic structure. Intrinsic scatters and correlations between\nX-ray properties are determined from merger history, baryonic processes, and\ndynamical state.\n  Aims. We look for an unbiased measurement of the scatter covariance matrix\nbetween the three main X-ray observable quantities attainable in large X-ray\nsurveys -- temperature, luminosity, and gas mass. This also gives us the\ncluster property with the lowest conditional intrinsic scatter at fixed mass.\n  Methods. Intrinsic scatters and correlations can be measured under the\nassumption that the observable properties of the intra-cluster medium hosted in\nclusters are log-normally distributed around power-law scaling relations. The\nproposed method is self-consistent, based on minimal assumptions, and requires\nneither the external calibration by weak lensing, dynamical, or hydrostatic\nmasses nor the knowledge of the mass completeness.\n  Results. We analyzed the 100 brightest clusters detected in the XXL Survey\nand their X-ray properties measured within a fixed radius of 300 kpc. The gas\nmass is the less scattered proxy (~8%). The temperature (~20%) is intrinsically\nless scattered than the luminosity (~30%) but it is measured with a larger\nobservational uncertainty. We found some evidence that gas mass, temperature\nand luminosity are positively correlated.

This problem contains two sets of fundamentally different\npreferential flow regimes; the first is caused by the viscous fingering and the\nsecond is due to the permeability contrasts between the fractures and rock\nmatrix.

This research is embedded into a\nwider endeavour to study binary evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars.\nMethod: The high amplitude pulsations were cleaned from the radial-velocity\ndata to better constrain the orbital motion. We used Gaia DR2 parallaxes in\ncombination with the SEDs to compute their luminosities which were complemented\nwith the ones computed using a period-luminosity-colour relation. The ratio of\nthe circumstellar infrared flux to the photospheric flux obtained from the SEDs\nwas used to estimate the orbital inclination of each system. Results: DF Cyg\nand RV Tau are binaries with spectroscopic orbital periods of 784$\\pm$16 days\nand 1198$\\pm$17 days, respectively. These orbital periods are found to be\nsimilar to the long-term periodic variability in the photometric time series,\nindicating that binarity indeed explains the long-term photometric variability.\nBoth systems are surrounded by a circumbinary disc which is grazed by our\nline-of-sight. As a result, the stellar photometric flux is extinct\nperiodically with the orbital period. Our derived orbital inclinations enabled\nus to obtain accurate companion masses for DF Cyg and RV Tau. Analysis of the\nKepler photometry of DF Cyg revealed a power spectrum with side lobes around\nthe fundamental pulsation frequency.

This technical note focuses on three forms\nof two-body rescattering. Elastic hadron+nucleus scattering primarily changes\nthe direction of the hadron with very little energy transfer. Secondly, a\nhadron+nucleon quasi-elastic process leads to the knockout of a single struck\nnucleon, possibly with charge exchange between the two hadrons. Also, a pion\ncan be absorbed leading to the ejection of two nucleons. There was an error in\nthe code of the {\\small GENIE} neutrino event generator that affects these\nprocesses.

The distortion of the other two\nprocesses is also mild for all distributions considered.

Pyramid supports search with popular similarity functions\nincluding Euclidean distance, angular distance and inner product. Different\nfrom existing distributed solutions that are based on KD-tree or locality\nsensitive hashing (LSH), Pyramid is based on Hierarchical Navigable Small World\ngraph (HNSW), which is the state of the art similarity search algorithm on a\nsingle machine. To achieve high query processing throughput, Pyramid partitions\na dataset into sub-datasets containing similar items for index building and\nassigns a query to only some of the sub-datasets for query processing. To\nprovide the robustness required by production deployment, Pyramid also supports\nfailure recovery and straggler mitigation. Pyramid offers a set of concise API\nsuch that users can easily use Pyramid without knowing the details of\ndistributed execution. Experiments on large-scale datasets show that Pyramid\nproduces quality results for similarity search, achieves high query processing\nthroughput and is robust under node failure and straggler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2019 15:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

Historically, one of the prevalent methods to\naccount for this uncertainty has been the standard Monte Carlo (MC) method.\nRecently, improved sampling methods have been proposed, based on the idea of\nvariance reduction by employing a hierarchy of mesh refinements. We combine an\nh- and p-refinement hierarchy with the Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) and\nMultilevel Quasi-Monte Carlo (MLQMC) method. We investigate the applicability\nof these novel combination methods on three structural engineering problems,\nfor which the uncertainty resides in the Young's modulus: the static response\nof a cantilever beam with elastic material behavior, its static response with\nelastoplastic behavior, and its dynamic response with elastic behavior. The\nuncertainty is either modeled by means of one random variable sampled from a\nunivariate Gamma distribution or with multiple random variables sampled from a\ngamma random field. This random field results from a truncated Karhunen-Lo\\`eve\n(KL) expansion. In this paper, we compare the computational costs of these\nMonte Carlo methods.

It covers the range of temperatures from T=0 to\n100 MeV, entropies per particle S/A between 0 and 6, lepton fractions from\nY$_L$=0.0 to 0.6, and baryon number densities n$_B$=0.05-1.2 fm$^{-3}$.\nApplications of the QMC-A EoS are made to cold neutron stars (NS) and to hot\nproto-neutron stars (PNS) in two scenarios, (i) lepton rich matter with trapped\nneutrinos and (ii) deleptonized chemically equilibrated matter. We find that\nthe QMC-A model predicts hyperons in amounts growing with increasing\ntemperature and density, thus suggesting not only their presence in PNS but\nalso, most likely, in NS merger remnants. The nucleon-hyperon phase transition\nis studied through the adiabatic index and the speed of sound c$_s$. It is\nshown that the lowering of (c$_s$/c)$^2$ to and below the conformal limit of\n1/3 is a general consequence of instabilities due to any phase transition and\nis not a unique fingerprint of the hadron-quark matter transition. Rigid\nrotation of cold and hot stars, their moments of inertia and Kepler frequencies\nare also explored.\n  The QMC-A model results are compared with two relativistic models, the chiral\nmean field model (CMF), and the generalized relativistic density functional\nwith hyperons (GRDF-Y). Similarities and differences are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2019 14:46:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 15:19:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 18:03:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-03"}

In the first part of our study, we focus on how the\nelectronic structure of monolayer nanoribbons of B$_2$S is modified under\nuniaxial strains, then employing a tight-binding framework together with the\nconventional theory of elasticity, we discuss how strain-induced local\ndeformations can be used as a means to affect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida\n(RKKY) interaction in zigzag nanoribbons of B$_2$S. We show that breaking\ninversion symmetry in zigzag B$_2$S nanoribbons (ZBSNR), e.g., by introducing\nstaggered sublattice potentials, play a key role in the modulation of their\nelectronic properties. More interestingly, for the ZBSNRs belong to the group\n$M=4p$, with $M$ the width of the ZBSNR and $p$ an integer number, one can see\nthat a band gap, in which a pair of near-midgap bands completely detached from\nthe bulk bands is always observed. As a key feature, the position of the midgap\nbands in the energy diagram of ZBSNRs can be shifted by applying the in-plane\nstrains $\\varepsilon_x$ and $\\varepsilon_y$. Moreover, the near-midgap\nbandwidth monotonically decreases with increasing strength of the strain and\nincreases with the width of the ZBSNR. The energy gap of the ZBSNRs decreased\nwith increasing the applied strain and ribbon width. The spatial and strain\ndependency of the exchange interaction in various configurations of the\nmagnetic impurities are also evaluated. The magnetic interactions between\nadsorbed magnetic impurities in B$_2$S nanoribbons can be manipulated by\ncareful strain engineering of such systems. Our results suggest that these\ntunable electronic and magnetic properties of ZBSNRs mean they may find\napplications in spintronics and pseudospin electronics based on monolayer\nB$_2$S nanoribbons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2019 15:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

It is demonstrated that we can obtain the time-frequency diagram of\nECG signal by wavelet transform, and use DNN to classify the time-frequency\ndiagram to find out the heart disease that the signal collector may have.\nOverall, an accuracy of 94 percent is achieved on the validation set.

Once stable entities like the\nEU now look fragile and political instability in the US presents unprecedented\nchallenges to an International Monetary System (IMS) that predominantly relies\non the USD and EUR as reserve currencies. In this environment, it is critical\nfor an international organization mandated to ensure stability to plan and act\nahead.

Tracking systems based on fiber Bragg gratings are an\nemerging technology for the navigation of minimal-invasive instruments which\ncan reduce the x-ray exposure and the used contrast agent. Shape sensing of\nflexible structures is challenging and includes many calculations steps which\nare prone to different errors. To reduce this errors, we present an optimized\nshape sensing model. Methods: We analyzed for every step of the shape sensing\nprocess, which errors can occur, how the error affects the shape and how it can\nbe compensated or minimized. Experiments were done with a multicore fiber\nsystem with 38 cm sensing length and the effects of different methods and\nparameters were analyzed. Furthermore we compared 3D shape reconstructions with\nthe segmented shape of the corresponding CT scans of the fiber to evaluate the\naccuracy of our optimized shape sensing model. Finally we tested our model in a\nrealistic endovascular scenario by using a 3D printed vessel system created\nfrom patient data. Results: Depending on the complexity of the shape we reached\nan average error of 0.35 to 1.15 mm and maximal error of 0.75 to 7.53 mm over\nthe whole 38 cm sensing length. In the endovascular scenario we obtained an\naverage and maximal error of 1.13 mm and 2.11 mm, respectively. Conclusions:\nThe accuracies of the 3D shape sensing model are promising and we plan to\ncombine the shape sensing based on fiber Bragg gratings with the position and\norientation of an electromagnetic sensor system to obtain the located shape of\nthe catheter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 2019 15:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 07:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}
