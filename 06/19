While such flexibility\nis a hallmark of intelligent behaviour, these multi-task scenarios remain an\nimportant challenge for machine learning algorithms and neurobiological models\nalike. We investigated two approaches that could enable this flexibility:\nfactorized representations, which abstract away general aspects of a task from\nthose prone to change, and nonparametric, memory-based approaches, which can\nprovide a principled way of using similarity to past experiences to guide\ncurrent behaviour. In particular, we combine the successor representation (SR)\nthat factors the value of actions into expected outcomes and corresponding\nrewards with evaluating task similarity through clustering the space of reward\nfunctions. The proposed algorithm inverts a generative model over tasks, and\ndynamically samples from a flexible number of distinct SR maps while\naccumulating evidence about the current task context through amortized\ninference. It improves SR's transfer capabilities and outperforms competing\nalgorithms and baselines in settings with both known and unsignalled rewards\nchanges. Further, as a neurobiological model of spatial coding in the\nhippocampus, it explains important signatures of this representation, such as\nthe \"flickering\" behaviour of hippocampal maps, and trajectory-dependent place\ncells (so-called splitter cells) and their dynamics. We thus provide a novel\nalgorithmic approach for multi-task learning, as well as a common normative\nframework that links together these different characteristics of the brain's\nspatial representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 16:03:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 17:11:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 15:45:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 16:31:08 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 15:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-13"}

Given\na dataset lying in a high-dimensional space (in principle hundreds to several\nthousands of dimensions), it is often useful to project it onto a\nlower-dimensional manifold, without loss of information. Identifying the\nminimal dimension of such manifold is a challenging problem known in the\nliterature as intrinsic dimension estimation (IDE). Traditionally, most IDE\nalgorithms are either based on multiscale principal component analysis (PCA) or\non the notion of correlation dimension (and more in general on\nk-nearest-neighbors distances). These methods are affected, in different ways,\nby a severe curse of dimensionality. In particular, none of the existing\nalgorithms can provide accurate ID estimates in the extreme locally\nundersampled regime, i.e. in the limit where the number of samples in any local\npatch of the manifold is less than (or of the same order of) the ID of the\ndataset. Here we introduce a new ID estimator that leverages on simple\nproperties of the tangent space of a manifold to overcome these shortcomings.\nThe method is based on the full correlation integral, going beyond the limit of\nsmall radius used for the estimation of the correlation dimension. Our\nestimator alleviates the extreme undersampling problem, intractable with other\nmethods. Based on this insight, we explore a multiscale generalization of the\nalgorithm.

In the\nparticular phases chosen the dual $(d+1)$-dimensional bulk solutions describe a\nvariety of black funnels and droplets. In the former the CFT readily conducts\nheat between the two black holes, but it in the latter such conduction is\nhighly suppressed. While the generic case can be understood in certain extreme\nlimits of parameters on general grounds, we focus on CFTs on specific\ngeometries conformally equivalent to a pair of $d \\ge 4$\nAdS${}_d$-Schwarzschild black holes of radius $R$. Such cases allow\nperturbative analyses of non-uniform funnels associated with Gregory-Laflamme\nzero-modes. For $d=4$ we construct a phase diagram for pure funnels and\ndroplets by constructing the desired bulk solutions numerically. The fat\nnon-uniform funnel is a particular interesting phase that dominates at small\n$R$ (due to having lowest free energy) despite being sub-dominant in the\nperturbative regime. The uniform funnel dominates at large $R$, and droplets\nand thin funnels dominate at certain intermediate values.

It is thought that this is\ndue to thermal reprocessing of the X-ray emission by the accretion disk. In\nthis scenario, the variable X-ray flux from the corona illuminates the\naccretion disk where it is partially reflected, and partially absorbed and\nthermalized in the disk producing a UV/optical reverberation signal. This will\nlead to a time lag increasing with wavelength. However, although the shape of\nthe observed time-lags as a function of wavelength is consistent with the model\npredictions, their amplitude suggested a disk which is significantly hotter\nthan expected. In this work, we estimate the response functions and the\ncorresponding time lags assuming a standard Novikov-Thorne accretion disk\nilluminated by a point-like X-ray source. We take into account all relativistic\neffects in the light propagation from the X-ray source to the disk then to the\nobserver.

The water snowline divides dry and icy solid material in\nprotoplanetary disks, and has been thought to significantly affect planet\nformation at all stages. If dry particles break up more easily than icy ones,\nthen the snowline causes a traffic jam, because small grains drift inward at\nlower speeds than larger pebbles. Aims. We aim to evaluate the effect of high\ndust concentrations around the snowline onto the gas dynamics. Methods. Using\nnumerical simulations, we model the global radial evolution of an axisymmetric\nprotoplanetary disk. Our model includes particle growth, evaporation and\nrecondensation of water, and the back-reaction of dust onto the gas, taking\ninto account the vertical distribution of dust particles. Results. We find that\nthe dust back-reaction can stop and even reverse the net flux of gas outside\nthe snowline, decreasing the gas accretion rate onto the star to under $50\\%$\nof its initial value. At the same time the dust accumulates at the snowline,\nreaching dust-to-gas ratios of $\\epsilon \\gtrsim 0.8$, and delivers large\namounts of water vapor towards the inner disk, as the icy particles cross the\nsnowline. However, the accumulation of dust at the snowline and the decrease in\nthe gas accretion rate only take place if the global dust-to-gas ratio is high\n($\\varepsilon_0 \\gtrsim 0.03$), if the viscous turbulence is low ($\\alpha_\\nu\n\\lesssim 10^{-3} $), if the disk is large enough ($r_c \\gtrsim 100\\,\n\\textrm{au}$), and only during the early phases of the disk evolution ($t\n\\lesssim 1\\, \\textrm{Myr}$).

Versatile devices can\nbe designed using several single-electron sources, possibly of different types,\ncoupled to the same quantum circuit. However, if combined \\textit{non-locally}\nto avoid cross-talk, the resulting architecture becomes very sensitive to\nelectronic decoherence. To circumvent this problem, we here analyse\ntwo-particle sources that operate with several single-electron (or hole)\nemitters attached in series to the same electronic waveguide. We demonstrate\nhow such a device can emit exactly two electrons without exciting unwanted\nelectron-hole pairs if the driving is adiabatic. Going beyond the adiabatic\nregime, perfect two-electron emission can be achieved by driving two quantum\ndot levels across the Fermi level of the external reservoir. If a\nsingle-electron source is combined with a source of holes, the emitted\nparticles can annihilate each other in a process which is governed by the\noverlap of their wave functions. Importantly, the degree of annihilation can be\ncontrolled by tuning the emission times, and the overlap can be determined by\nmeasuring the shot noise after a beam splitter. In contrast to a Hong-Ou-Mandel\nexperiment, the wave functions overlap close to the emitters and not after\npropagating to the beam splitter, making the shot noise reduction less\nsusceptible to electronic decoherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 17:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}

At times and in regions where feedback heating is ineffective,\nhot gas in the galaxy halo is expected to form a cooling flow, where the gas\nadvects inward on a cooling timescale. Cooling flow solutions can thus be used\nas a benchmark for observations and simulations to constrain the timing and\nextent of feedback heating. Using analytic calculations and idealized 3D\nhydrodynamic simulations, we show that for a given halo mass and cooling\nfunction, steady-state cooling flows form a single-parameter family of\nsolutions, while initially hydrostatic gaseous halos converge on one of these\nsolutions within a cooling time. The solution is thus fully determined once\neither the mass inflow rate $\\dot{M}$ or the total halo gas mass are known. In\nthe Milky Way (MW) halo, a cooling flow with $\\dot{M}$ equal to the star\nformation rate predicts a ratio of the cooling time to the free-fall time of\n~10, similar to some feedback-regulated models. This solution also correctly\npredicts observed OVII and OVIII absorption columns, and the gas density\nprofile implied by OVII and OVIII emission.

In contrast for eclipsing\nsystems, the X-rays we receive during eclipse are only those produced by\nreprocessing of the emission from the compact star by the surrounding medium.\nWe report results from a spectral study of the X-ray emission during eclipse\nand outside eclipse (when available) in 9 high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) with\nXMM- Newton EPIC pn to investigate different aspects of the stellar wind in\nthese HMXBs. During eclipse the continuum component of the spectrum is reduced\nby a factor of $\\sim$8-237, but the count-rate for 6.4 keV Iron emission line\nor complex of Iron emission lines in HMXBs are reduced by a smaller factor\nleading to large equivalent widths of the Iron emission lines.

We focus on\nbackdoor-based watermarking and propose two -- a black-box and a white-box --\nattacks that remove the watermark. Our black-box attack steals the model and\nremoves the watermark with minimum requirements; it just relies on public\nunlabeled data and a black-box access to the classification label. It does not\nneed classification confidences or access to the model's sensitive information\nsuch as the training data set, the trigger set or the model parameters. The\nwhite-box attack, proposes an efficient watermark removal when the parameters\nof the marked model are available; our white-box attack does not require access\nto the labeled data or the trigger set and improves the runtime of the\nblack-box attack up to seventeen times.

One key goal in flow cytometry analysis is to pinpoint the\nimmune cells responsive to certain stimuli. Statistically, this problem can be\ntranslated into comparing two protein expression probability density functions\n(PDFs) before and after the stimulus; the goal is to pinpoint the regions where\nthese two pdfs differ. In this paper, we model this comparison as a multiple\ntesting problem. First, we partition the sample space into small bins. In each\nbin we form a hypothesis to test the existence of differential pdfs. Second, we\ndevelop a novel multiple testing method, called TEAM (Testing on the\nAggregation tree Method), to identify those bins that harbor differential pdfs\nwhile controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) under the desired level. TEAM\nembeds the testing procedure into an aggregation tree to test from fine- to\ncoarse-resolution. The procedure achieves the statistical goal of pinpointing\ndifferential pdfs to the smallest possible regions. TEAM is computationally\nefficient, capable of analyzing large flow cytometry data sets in much shorter\ntime compared with competing methods.

The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed\napproach obtains more accurate foreground and background maps with the\nassistance of the breast anatomy; especially, for the images having large or\nsmall tumors; meanwhile, the new objective function can handle the images\nwithout tumors.

The key observation was that first order methods can be studied from\na dynamical systems perspective, in which instantiations of Center-Stable\nmanifold theorem allow for a global analysis. The results of the aforementioned\npapers were limited to the case where the step-size $\\alpha$ is constant, i.e.,\ndoes not depend on time (and bounded from the inverse of the Lipschitz constant\nof the gradient of $f$). It remains an open question whether or not the results\nstill hold when the step-size is time dependent and vanishes with time.\n  In this paper, we resolve this question on the affirmative for gradient\ndescent, mirror descent, manifold descent and proximal point. The main\ntechnical challenge is that the induced (from each first order method)\ndynamical system is time non-homogeneous and the stable manifold theorem is not\napplicable in its classic form. By exploiting the dynamical systems structure\nof the aforementioned first order methods, we are able to prove a stable\nmanifold theorem that is applicable to time non-homogeneous dynamical systems\nand generalize the results in \\cite{LPP} for vanishing step-sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 19:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-20"}

Optimal poisoning attacks have\nalready been proposed to evaluate worst-case scenarios, modelling attacks as a\nbi-level optimization problem. Solving these problems is computationally\ndemanding and has limited applicability for some models such as deep networks.\nIn this paper we introduce a novel generative model to craft systematic\npoisoning attacks against machine learning classifiers generating adversarial\ntraining examples, i.e. samples that look like genuine data points but that\ndegrade the classifier's accuracy when used for training. We propose a\nGenerative Adversarial Net with three components: generator, discriminator, and\nthe target classifier.

However, it is a challenging\nproblem with high inter-rater variability and inherent ambiguity due to\ninconclusive evidence in the data, limited data quality or subjective\ndefinitions of disease appearance. Current deep learning solutions for chest\nradiograph abnormality classification are typically limited to providing\nprobabilistic predictions, relying on the capacity of learning models to adapt\nto the high degree of label noise and become robust to the enumerated causal\nfactors. In practice, however, this leads to overconfident systems with poor\ngeneralization on unseen data. To account for this, we propose an automatic\nsystem that learns not only the probabilistic estimate on the presence of an\nabnormality, but also an explicit uncertainty measure which captures the\nconfidence of the system in the predicted output. We argue that explicitly\nlearning the classification uncertainty as an orthogonal measure to the\npredicted output, is essential to account for the inherent variability\ncharacteristic of this data. Experiments were conducted on two datasets of\nchest radiographs of over 85,000 patients. Sample rejection based on the\npredicted uncertainty can significantly improve the ROC-AUC, e.g., by 8% to\n0.91 with an expected rejection rate of under 25%. Eliminating training samples\nusing uncertainty-driven bootstrapping, enables a significant increase in\nrobustness and accuracy.

In particular, high-orbital angular momentum\nmodes can be focused with less power in the presence of low-orbital angular\nmomentum beams than when propagating alone. The decrease in required critical\npower can be made arbitrarily large by choosing the appropriate combinations of\nmodes.

The concordance of differential expression of these markers between\nthe cancer type they represent and others is confirmed.

From small, tabular settings such as\ngridworlds to large, continuous and sparse reward settings such as robotic\nobject manipulation tasks, exploration through adding an uncertainty bonus to\nthe reward function has been shown to be effective when the uncertainty is able\nto accurately drive exploration towards promising states.

For example, learning many auxiliary value functions, in\naddition to optimizing the environmental reward, appears to improve both\nexploration and representation learning. The question we tackle in this paper\nis how to sculpt the stream of experience---how to adapt the learning system's\nbehavior---to optimize the learning of a collection of value functions. A\nsimple answer is to compute an intrinsic reward based on the statistics of each\nauxiliary learner, and use reinforcement learning to maximize that intrinsic\nreward. Unfortunately, implementing this simple idea has proven difficult, and\nthus has been the focus of decades of study. It remains unclear which of the\nmany possible measures of learning would work well in a parallel learning\nsetting where environmental reward is extremely sparse or absent. In this\npaper, we investigate and compare different intrinsic reward mechanisms in a\nnew bandit-like parallel-learning testbed. We discuss the interaction between\nreward and prediction learners and highlight the importance of introspective\nprediction learners: those that increase their rate of learning when progress\nis possible, and decrease when it is not. We provide a comprehensive empirical\ncomparison of 14 different rewards, including well-known ideas from\nreinforcement learning and active learning. Our results highlight a simple but\nseemingly powerful principle: intrinsic rewards based on the amount of learning\ncan generate useful behavior, if each individual learner is introspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 01:07:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2020 23:39:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 15:59:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 03:33:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

Unlike existing methods that require\nrecording a video using a color camera and/or a depth camera, our method only\nneeds a small number of (e.g., 3-5) color images from uncalibrated sparse views\nas input, which greatly simplifies data acquisition and extends applicable\nscenarios. Since different views have limited overlaps, our method allows a\nsingle image as input to discern the depth and semantic information of the\nscene. The key issue is how to recover relatively accurate depth from single\nimages and reconstruct a 3D scene by fusing very few depth maps. To address\nthis problem, we first design an iterative deep architecture, IterNet, that\nestimates depth and semantic segmentation alternately, so that they benefit\neach other. To deal with the little overlap and non-rigid transformation\nbetween views, we further propose a joint global and local registration method\nto reconstruct a 3D scene with semantic information from sparse views. We also\nmake available a new indoor synthetic dataset simultaneously providing\nphotorealistic high-resolution RGB images, accurate depth maps and pixel-level\nsemantic labels for thousands of complex layouts, useful for training and\nevaluation. Experimental results on public datasets and our dataset demonstrate\nthat our method achieves more accurate depth estimation, smaller semantic\nsegmentation errors and better 3D reconstruction results, compared with\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 03:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-20"}

Graphene\nnanoribbons and polyacetylene have chiral symmetry and share numerous similar\nproperties, e.g., the bulk-edge correspondence between the Zak phase and the\nexistence of edge states, along with the presence of chiral boundary states,\nwhich are important for charge fractionalization. In polyacetylene, a fermion\nmass potential in the Dirac equation produces an excitation gap, and a twist in\nthis scalar potential produces a zero-energy chiral soliton. Similarly, in a\ngapful armchair graphene nanoribbon, a distortion in the chiral gauge field can\nproduce soliton states. In polyacetylene, a soliton is bound to a domain wall\nconnecting two different dimerized phases. In graphene nanoribbons, a\ndomain-wall soliton connects two topological zigzag edges with different\nchiralities. However, such a soliton does not display spin-charge separation.\nThe existence of a soliton in finite-length polyacetylene can induce formation\nof fractional charges on the opposite ends. In contrast, for gapful graphene\nnanoribbons, the antiferromagnetic coupling between the opposite zigzag edges\ninduces integer boundary charges. The presence of disorder in graphene\nnanoribbons partly mitigates antiferromagnetic coupling effect. Hence, the\naverage edge charge of gap states with energies within a small interval is e/2,\nwith significant charge fluctuations. However, midgap states exhibit a\nwell-defined charge fractionalization between the opposite zigzag edges in the\nweak-disorder regime.

Visual examination of the crop is laborious and time\nconsuming. Therefore, quick and precise estimation of heading date of paddy\nrice is highly essential. In this work, we propose a simple pipeline to detect\nregions containing flowering panicles from ground level RGB images of paddy\nrice. Given a fixed region size for an image, the number of regions containing\nflowering panicles is directly proportional to the number of flowering panicles\npresent. Consequently, we use the flowering panicle region counts to estimate\nthe heading date of the crop. The method is based on image classification using\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We evaluated the performance of our\nalgorithm on five time series image sequences of three different varieties of\nrice crops. When compared to the previous work on this dataset, the accuracy\nand general versatility of the method has been improved and heading date has\nbeen estimated with a mean absolute error of less than 1 day.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 05:02:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-08"}

Despite the considerable time and resources devoted to\ndesigning and developing the system, the ADS-B is well known for its lack of\nsecurity mechanisms. Attempts to address these security vulnerabilities have\nbeen made in previous studies by modifying the protocol's current architecture\nor by using additional hardware components.

MHD disc models also suggest the existence of a dead-zone\nat $R\\lesssim 10$ AU, where the regions close to the midplane remain laminar.\nIn this context, we use two-fluid hydrodynamical simulations to study the\ninteraction between a low-mass planet ($\\sim 1.7 \\;{\\rm M_\\oplus}$) on a fixed\norbit and an inviscid pebble-rich disc with solid-to-gas ratio $\\epsilon\\ge\n0.5$. For pebbles with Stokes numbers St=0.1, 0.5, multiple dusty vortices are\nformed through the Rossby Wave Instability at the planet separatrix. Effects\ndue to gas drag then lead to a strong enhancement in the solid-to-gas ratio,\nwhich can increase by a factor of $\\sim 10^3$ for marginally coupled particles\nwith St=0.5. As in streaming instabilities, pebble clumps reorganize into\nfilaments that may plausibly collapse to form planetesimals.

Again, particle filaments evolving in a gap are formed in the disc\nwhile the planet undergoes an episode of outward migration. Our results suggest\nthat vortex instabilities triggered by low-mass planets could play an important\nrole in forming planetesimals in pebble-rich, inviscid discs, and may\nsignificantly modify the migration of low-mass planets.

Using the\npower system model, we can verify that the SE objective function enjoys nice\nproperties (strongly convex, smoothness) which in turn guarantee a linear\nconvergence rate of the proposed GD-based SE method. To further accelerate the\nconvergence speed, we consider the accelerated gradient descent (AGD)\nextension, as well as their robust versions under outlier data and a hybrid\nGD-based SE approach with additional synchrophasor measurements. Numerical\ntests on the IEEE 118-bus, 300-bus and the synthetic ACTIVSg2000-bus systems\nhave demonstrated that FGD-SE and AGD-SE, can approach the near-optimal\nperformance of the SDP-SE solution at significantly improved computational\nefficiency, especially so for AGD-SE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 08:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-20"}

The beamwidth of the\ndirectional distribution is narrowest near the spectral peak frequency, and\nincreases toward both higher and lower frequencies. Recent advances in global\npositioning, laser ranging and computer technologies have made it possible to\nacquire high-resolution 3D topography of ocean surface waves. Directional\nspectral analysis of the ocean surface topography clearly shows that in a young\nwave field, two dominant wave systems travel at oblique angles to the wind and\nthe ocean surface display a crosshatched pattern. One possible mechanism\ngenerating this bimodal directional wave field is resonant propagation as\nsuggested by Phillips resonance theory of wind wave generation.

The generalized\nCovariance Intersection (GCI) fusion rule is employed to fuse multiple MB\nrandom finite set densities. The fused density comprises a set of fusion\nhypotheses that grow exponentially with the number of Bernoulli components.\nThus, GCI fusion with MB filters can become computationally intractable in\npractical applications that involve tracking of even a moderate number of\nobjects. In order to accelerate the multi-sensor fusion procedure, we derive a\ntheoretically sound approximation to the fused density. The number of fusion\nhypotheses in the resulting density is significantly smaller than the original\nfused density. It also has a parallelizable structure that allows multiple\nclusters of Bernoulli components to be fused independently. By carefully\nclustering Bernoulli components into isolated clusters using the GCI divergence\nas the distance metric, we propose an alternative to build exactly the\napproximated density without exhaustively computing all the fusion hypotheses.\nThe combination of the proposed approximation technique and the fast clustering\nalgorithm can enable a novel and fast GCIMB fusion implementation. Our analysis\nshows that the proposed fusion method can dramatically reduce the computational\nand memory requirements with small bounded L1-error. The Gaussian mixture\nimplementation of the proposed method is also presented. In various numerical\nexperiments, including a challenging scenario with up to forty objects, the\nefficacy of the proposed fusion method is demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 09:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Poor\nresearch ethics may lead to mistrust of research results, lost funding and\nretraction of publications. A core principle for research ethics is\nconfidentiality, and anonymization is a standard approach to guarantee it. Many\nguidelines for qualitative software engineering research, and for qualitative\nresearch in general, exist, but these do not penetrate how and why to anonymize\ninterview data. Aims: In this paper we aim to identify ethical guidelines for\nsoftware engineering interview studies involving industrial practitioners.\nMethod: By learning from previous experiences and listening to the authority of\nexisting guidelines in the more mature field of medicine as well as in software\nengineering, a comprehensive set of checklists for interview studies was\ndistilled. Results: The elements of an interview study were identified and\nethical considerations and recommendations for each step were produced, in\nparticular with respect to anonymization. Important ethical principles are:\nconsent, beneficence, confidentiality, scientific value, researcher skill,\njustice, respect for law, and ethical reviews. Conclusions: The most important\ncontribution of this study is the set of checklists for ethical interview\nstudies. Future work is needed to refine these guidelines with respect to legal\naspects and ethical boards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 09:32:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-20"}

For more than six decades, the\ncmDm wave components are generally considered to be in the equilibrium range,\nand its spectral function has a constant slope: -5 or -4 in the 1D frequency\nspectrum, and -3 or -2.5 in the 1D wavenumber spectrum. Some variations of the\nequilibrium spectrum models include varying the frequency spectral slope from 4\nto 5 at some multiple of the spectral peak frequency, or incorporating a\nthreshold velocity in the reference wind speed. Extensive efforts are then\ndevoted to quantifying the spectral coefficient of the equilibrium spectrum\nfunction. The observed wind wave spectral slopes in the ocean environment,\nhowever, are rarely constant. The variable spectral slope is indicative of the\nnonequilibrium nature of surface wind waves in the field. As a result the wave\nproperties in field observations are significantly different from those\ninferred from assuming a constant spectral slope. From signal-to-noise\nconsideration the surface slope measurements are much more sensitive than the\nelevation data for the study of cmDm waves. Recently, several large datasets of\nlow-pass-filtered mean square slope (LPMSS) have been reported in support of\nthe Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSSR) tropical cyclone\nwind sensing effort. Combining the LPMSS observations with a spectrum model\nthat accommodates a variable spectral slope, this paper seeks to quantify the\nconnection between the variable spectral slope and the spectral properties of\ncmDm waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 09:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-20"}

This paper reports on the all-sky search for\ngravitational waves from intermediate mass black hole binaries in the first and\nsecond observing runs of the Advanced LIGO and Virgo network. The search uses\nthree independent algorithms: two based on matched filtering of the data with\nwaveform templates of gravitational wave signals from compact binaries, and a\nthird, model-independent algorithm that employs no signal model for the\nincoming signal. No intermediate mass black hole binary event was detected in\nthis search. Consequently, we place upper limits on the merger rate density for\na family of intermediate mass black hole binaries. In particular, we choose\nsources with total masses $M=m_1+m_2\\in[120,800]$M$_\\odot$ and mass ratios $q =\nm_2/m_1 \\in[0.1,1.0]$. For the first time, this calculation is done using\nnumerical relativity waveforms (which include higher modes) as models of the\nreal emitted signal.

This task can be achieved by using a CS\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can handle such language\nswitches. In our previous work, we have investigated the code-switching\ndetection performance of the Frisian-Dutch CS ASR system by using the time\nalignment of the most likely hypothesis and found that this technique suffers\nfrom over-switching due to numerous very short spurious language switches. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel method for CS detection aiming to remedy this\nshortcoming by using the language posteriors which are the sum of the\nframe-level posteriors of phones belonging to the same language. The CS\nASR-generated language posteriors contain more complete language-specific\ninformation on frame level compared to the time alignment of the ASR output.\nHence, it is expected to yield more accurate and robust CS detection. The CS\ndetection experiments demonstrate that the proposed language posterior-based\napproach provides higher detection accuracy than the baseline system in terms\nof equal error rate. Moreover, a detailed CS detection error analysis reveals\nthat using language posteriors reduces the false alarms and results in more\nrobust CS detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 09:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-20"}

In fact, if linear interactions\nwith the mediator are absent the most important DM production mechanisms at\ncolliders could lead to final states with missing transverse energy (MET) in\nassociation with at least two fermions, such as di-jet or di-electron\nsignatures. The framework we consider is model-independent, in a sense that it\nis only based on symmetry and formulated in the (extended) DM Effective Field\nTheory (eDMEFT) approach.

The concept of\nfact became part of the German language remarkably late. It gained momentum\nonly toward the end of the eighteenth century. I show that the concept of fact\nemerged as part of a historical knowledge tradition, which comprised both human\nand natural empirical study. Around 1800, parts of this tradition, including\nthe concept of fact, were integrated into the epistemological basis of several\nemerging disciplines, including physics and historiography. During this process\nof discipline formation, the concept of fact remained fluid. I reveal this\nfluidity by unearthing different interpretations and roles of facts in\ndifferent German contexts around 1800. I demonstrate how a fact-based\nepistemology emerged at the University of G\\\"ottingen in the late eighteenth\ncentury, by focusing on universal historian August Ludwig Schl\\\"ozer and the\nexperimentalist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. In a time of scientific and\npolitical revolutions, they regarded facts as eternal knowledge, contrasting\nthem with short-lived theories and speculations. Remarkably, Schl\\\"ozer and\nLichtenberg construed facts as the basis of Wissenschaft, but not as\nWissenschaft itself. Only after 1800, empirically minded German physicists and\nhistorians granted facts self-contained value. As physics and historiography\nbecame institutionalized at German universities, the concept of fact acquired\ndifferent interpretations in different disciplinary settings. These related to\nfact-oriented research practices, such as precision measurement in physics and\nsource criticism in historiography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 10:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-20"}

Monocular\nstructure-from-motion raises the issue of properly estimating the scale of the\n3D models, in order to later use those models for metrology. The scale can be\ndetermined from the presence of visible objects of known dimensions, or from\ninformation on the magnitude of the camera motion provided by other sensors,\nsuch as GPS.\n  This paper addresses the problem of accurately scaling 3D models created from\nmonocular cameras in GPS-denied environments, such as in underwater\napplications. Motivated by the common availability of underwater laser scalers,\nwe present two novel approaches. A fully-calibrated method enables the use of\narbitrary laser setups, while a partially-calibrated method reduces the need\nfor calibration by only assuming parallelism on the laser beams, with no\nconstraints on the camera. The proposed methods have several advantages with\nrespect to the existing methods. The need for laser alignment with the optical\naxis of the camera is removed, together with the extremely error-prone manual\nidentification of image points on the 3D model.\n  The performance of the methods and their applicability was evaluated on both\ndata generated from a realistic 3D model and data collected during an\noceanographic cruise in 2017. Three separate laser configurations have been\ntested, encompassing nearly all possible laser setups, to evaluate the effects\nof terrain roughness, noise, camera perspective angle and camera-scene\ndistance.

Aims: The objective of this paper is to provide\nempirical evidence on: 1) the frequency of project abandonment and survival, 2)\nthe differences between abandoned and surviving projects, and 3) the motivation\nand difficulties faced when assuming an abandoned project. Method: We adopt a\nmixed-methods approach to investigate project abandonment and survival.

We show\nthat this variable, the magnitude of the Runge-Lenz vector ($e_{\\rm RL}$), is\nnot an appropriate measure of orbital eccentricity, when the eccentricity is\nsmaller than the leading non-Keplerian perturbation of the orbit. Following\nLoutrel et al., we use Newtonian equations of motion plus the leading\ngravitational radiation-reaction terms, the osculating-orbits approach for\ncharacterizing binary orbits, and a two-timescale analysis for separating\nsecular from periodic variations of the orbit elements. We find that $e_{\\rm\nRL}$ does grow at late times, but that the actual orbital variables $r$ and\n$dr/dt$ show no such growth in oscillations. This is in complete agreement with\nLoutrel et al. We reconcile this apparent contradiction by pointing out that it\nis essential to take into account the direction of the Runge-Lenz vector, not\njust its magnitude. At late times in an inspiral, that direction, which defines\nthe pericenter angle, advances at the same rate as the orbital phase. The\ncorrect picture is then of a physically circular orbit whose osculating\ncounterpart is indeed eccentric but that resides permanently at the orbit's\nlatus rectum at $-90^{\\rm o}$, therefore exhibiting no oscillations. Including\nfirst post-Newtonian effects in the equations of motion, we show that $e_{\\rm\nRL}$ grows even more dramatically.

The Fe\ndistribution of these clusters along the merging axis is found to be in good\nagreement with the azimuthally-averaged Fe abundance profile in typical\nnon-cool-core clusters out to $r_{500}$. In addition to showing a moderate\ncentral abundance peak, though less pronounced than in relaxed systems, the Fe\nabundance flattens at large radii towards $\\sim$0.2-0.3 $Z_\\odot$. Although\nthis shallow metal distribution is in line with the idea that disturbed,\nnon-cool-core clusters originate from the merging of relaxed, cool-core\nclusters, we find that in some cases, remnants of metal-rich and low entropy\ncool cores can persist after major mergers.

We use an end-to-end learning approach in allowing the model\nto map directly from input image pairs to an estimate of ego-motion\n(parameterized as 6-DoF transformation matrices). We introduce a novel\ntwo-module Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks called\nPoseConvGRU, with an explicit sequence pose estimation loss to achieve this.\nThe feature-encoding module encodes the short-term motion feature in an image\npair, while the memory-propagating module captures the long-term motion feature\nin the consecutive image pairs. The visual memory is implemented with\nconvolutional gated recurrent units, which allows propagating information over\ntime. At each time step, two consecutive RGB images are stacked together to\nform a 6 channels tensor for module-1 to learn how to extract motion\ninformation and estimate poses. The sequence of output maps is then passed\nthrough a stacked ConvGRU module to generate the relative transformation pose\nof each image pair. We also augment the training data by randomly skipping\nframes to simulate the velocity variation which results in a better performance\nin turning and high-velocity situations. We evaluate the performance of our\nproposed approach on the KITTI Visual Odometry benchmark.

Experimentation was performed through\nsandwiching the marbles between two cup-style electrodes and stimulating them\nwith repeated DC pulses at 3.0 V. Our results demonstrate that `entrainment' of\na carbon nanotube filled-copper liquid marble via periodic pulses can cause\ntheir electrical resistance to rapidly switch between high to low resistance\nprofiles, upon inverting the polarity of stimulation: the reduction in\nresistance between high and low profiles was approximately 88\\% after two\nrounds of entrainment. This effect was found to be reversible through reversion\nto the original stimulus polarity and was strengthened by repeated\nexperimentation, as evidenced by a mean reduction in time to switching onset of\n43\\%. These effects were not replicated in nanotube solutions not bound inside\nliquid marbles. Our electrical characterisation also reveals that\nnanotube-filled liquid marbles exhibit pinched loop hysteresis IV profiles\nconsistent with the description of memristors.

At each time, a player chooses an arm out of N arms to\nplay, referred to as an active arm, and receives a random reward from a finite\nset of reward states. The reward state of the active arm transits according to\nan unknown Markovian dynamics. The reward state of passive arms (which are not\nchosen to play at time t) evolves according to an arbitrary unknown random\nprocess. The objective is an arm-selection policy that minimizes the regret,\ndefined as the reward loss with respect to a player that always plays the most\nrewarding arm. This class of RMAB problems has been studied recently in the\ncontext of communication networks and financial investment applications. We\ndevelop a strategy that selects arms to be played in a consecutive manner,\ndubbed Adaptive Sequencing Rules (ASR) algorithm. The sequencing rules for\nselecting arms under the ASR algorithm are adaptively updated and controlled by\nthe current sample reward means.

The day/night temperature\ndifference on HAT-P-7b (~ 2500K) causes clouds to form on the nightside\n(dominated by H2/He) while the dayside (dominated by H/He) retains cloud-free\nequatorial regions. The cloud particles vary in composition and size throughout\nthe vertical extension of the cloud, but also globally.\nTiO2[s]/Al2O3[s]/CaTiO3[s]-particles of cm-sized radii occur in the higher\ndayside-latitudes, resulting in a dayside dominated by gas-phase opacity.

In\nparticular we are interested in the energy spectrum for different pasta\nconfigurations considered.\n  Method: Employing the density functional theory (DFT) approach, we calculate\nthe binding energy of the different configurations for three values of the\nproton content XP = 1/10, 1/3 and 1/2, by optimizing their periodic length. We\nstudy finite temperature effects and the impact of electron screening.\n  Results: Nuclear pasta lowers the energy significantly compared to uniform\nmatter, especially for $X_P \\geq 1/3$. However, the different configurations\nhave very similar binding energies. For large proton content, $X_P \\geq 1/3$,\nthe pasta configurations are very stable, for lower proton content temperatures\nof a few MeV are enough for the transition to uniform matter. Electron\nscreening has a small influence on the binding energy of nuclear pasta, but\nincreases its periodic length.\n  Conclusion: Nuclear pasta in the mid-density regime lowers the energy of the\nmatter for all proton fractions under study. It can survive even large\ntemperatures of several MeV. Since various configurations have very similar\nenergy, it is to expected that many configurations can coexist simultaneously\nalready at small temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 15:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

Persistence employs a sequence of objects built on data\ncalled a filtration. A Mapper produces insightful summaries of data, and has\nfound widespread applications in diverse areas.\n  We define a new filtration called the cover filtration built from a single\ncover based on a generalized Steinhaus distance, which is a generalization of\nJaccard distance. We prove a stability result: the cover filtrations of two\ncovers are $\\alpha/m$ interleaved, where $\\alpha$ is a bound on bottleneck\ndistance between covers and $m$ is the size of smallest set in either cover. We\nalso show our construction is equivalent to the Cech filtration under certain\nsettings, and the Vietoris-Rips filtration completely determines the cover\nfiltration in all cases.

The\nsynchronization stability that quantifies how well the power-grid system\nrecovers its synchrony against perturbation depends on various factors. As an\nintrinsic factor that we can design and control, the transmission capacity of\nthe power grid affects the synchronization stability. Therefore, the transition\npattern of the synchronization stability with the different levels of\ntransmission capacity against external perturbation provides the stereoscopic\nperspective to understand the synchronization behavior of power grids. In this\nstudy, we extensively investigate the factors affecting the synchronization\nstability transition by using the concept of basin stability as a function of\nthe transmission capacity. For a systematic approach, we introduce the\nintegrated basin instability, which literally adds up the instability values as\nthe transmission capacity increases. We first take simple 5-node motifs as a\ncase study of building blocks of power grids, and a more realistic IEEE 24-bus\nmodel to highlight the complexity of decisive factors. We find that both\nstructural properties such as gate keepers in network topology and dynamical\nproperties such as large power input/output at nodes cause synchronization\ninstability.

In the\naction we introduce the effective potential, which has quadratic dependence on\nthe holographic coordinate $z$ and depends on both the gluon and quark\ncondensates. Choosing the AdS geometry we restrict ourselves to the AdS\nPoincar\\'e metric, because the contribution of the AdS-Schwarzschild geometry\nstarts at next-to-leading order ${\\cal O}(T^4)$. Hence, one can neglect the\ntemperature dependence of the AdS geometry at small $T$. This is consistent\nwith the Hawking-Page phase transition at a critical temperature representing\nthe transition between thermal AdS/QCD and AdS-Schwarzschild geometry. In the\nsmall temperature regime we base our analysis on the temperature dependence of\nthe effective potential, which starts at order ${\\cal O}(T^2)$, due to the\nleading contribution from the quark condensate.

A hazed image formation\nmodel is widely used to restore the image quality. It depends on two optical\nparameters: the background light and the transmission map. Underwater images\ncan also be enhanced by color and contrast correction from the perspective of\nimage processing. In this paper, we propose an effective underwater image\nenhancement method for underwater images in composition of underwater image\nrestoration and color correction. Firstly, a manually annotated background\nlights (MABLs) database is developed. With reference to the relationship\nbetween MABLs and the histogram distributions of various underwater images,\nrobust statistical models of BLs estimation are provided. Next, the TM of R\nchannel is roughly estimated based on the new underwater dark channel prior via\nthe statistic of clear and high resolution underwater images, then a scene\ndepth map based on the underwater light attenuation prior and an adjusted\nreversed saturation map are applied to compensate and modify the coarse TM of R\nchannel. Next, TMs of G-B channels are estimated based on the difference of\nattenuation ratios between R channel and G-B channels. Finally, to improve the\ncolor and contrast of the restored image with a natural appearance, a variation\nof white balance is introduced as post-processing. In order to guide the\npriority of underwater image enhancement, sufficient evaluations are conducted\nto discuss the impacts of the key parameters including BL and TM, and the\nimportance of the color correction. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art\nmethods demonstrate that our proposed underwater image enhancement method can\nachieve higher accuracy of estimated BLs, less computation time, more superior\nperformance, and more valuable information retention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 12:19:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-21"}

We focus on a three layer adaptive\nnetwork model, where a polycentric governance network interacts with a social\nnetwork of resource users which in turn interacts with an ecological network of\nrenewable resources. We uncover that sustainability is favored for slow\ninteraction timescales, large homophilic network adaptation rate (as long it is\nbelow the fragmentation threshold) and high taxation rates.

When selecting a predictive tool, for implementation at clinical\npractice or for recommendation in clinical guidelines, clinicians are\nchallenged with an overwhelming and ever growing number of tools, most of which\nhave never been implemented or assessed for comparative effectiveness.\nObjective: To develop a comprehensive framework to Grade and Assess Predictive\ntools (GRASP), and provide clinicians with a standardised, evidence based\nsystem to support their search for and selection of effective tools. Methods: A\nfocused review of literature was conducted to extract criteria along which\ntools should be evaluated. An initial framework was designed and applied to\nassess and grade five tools: LACE Index, Centor Score, Wells Criteria, Modified\nEarly Warning Score, and Ottawa knee rule. After peer review, by expert\nclinicians and healthcare researchers, the framework was revised and the\ngrading of the tools was updated. Results: GRASP framework grades predictive\ntools based on published evidence across three dimensions: 1) Phase of\nevaluation; 2) Level of evidence; and 3) Direction of evidence. The final grade\nof a tool is based on the highest phase of evaluation, supported by the highest\nlevel of positive evidence, or mixed evidence that supports positive\nconclusion. Discussion and Conclusion: the GRASP framework builds on well\nestablished models and widely accepted concepts to provide standardised\nassessment and evidence based grading of predictive tools. Unlike other\nmethods, GRASP is based on the critical appraisal of published evidence\nreporting the predictive tools predictive performance before implementation,\npotential effect and usability during implementation, and their post\nimplementation impact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 01:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

Although security of a PoW cryptocurrency is\nalways the top priority, it is threatened by mining attacks like selfish\nmining. Researchers have proposed many mining attack models with one attacker,\nand optimized the attacker's strategy. During these mining attacks, an attacker\npursues a higher relative revenue (RR) by wasting a large amount of\ncomputational power of the honest miners at the cost of a small amount of\ncomputational power of himself. In this paper, we propose a mining attack model\nwith two phases: the original system and the multi-attacker system. It is the\nfirst model to provide both theoretical and quantitative analysis of mining\nattacks with two attackers. We explain how the original system turns into the\nmulti-attacker system by introducing two attackers: the internal attacker and\nthe external attacker. If both attackers take the attacking strategy selfish\nmining, the RR of the internal attacker in multi-attacker system will drop by\nup to 31.9% compared with his RR in original system. The external attacker will\noverestimate his RR by up to 44.6% in multiattacker system. Unexpected\ncompetitions, auctions between attackers and overestimation of attackers'\ninfluence factor are three main causes of both attackers' dropping RR. We\npropose a mining strategy named Partial Initiative Release (PIR) which is a\nsemi-honest mining strategy in multi-attacker system. In some specific\nsituations, PIR allows the attacker to get more block reward by launching an\nattack in multi-attacker system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 11:25:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}
