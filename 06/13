Hypervelocity stars move fast enough to leave the gravitational\nfield of their home galaxies and venture into intergalactic space. The most\nextreme examples known have estimated speeds in excess of 1000 km/s. These can\nbe easily induced at the centres of galaxies via close encounters between\nbinary stars and supermassive black holes; however, a number of other\nmechanisms operating elsewhere can produce them as well.\n  Aims. Recent studies suggest that hypervelocity stars are ubiquitous in the\nlocal Universe. In the Milky Way, the known hypervelocity stars are\nanisotropically distributed, but it is unclear why. Here, we used Gaia Data\nRelease 2 (DR2) data to perform a systematic exploration aimed at confirming or\nrefuting these findings.\n  Methods. We assume that the farther the candidate hypervelocity stars are,\nthe more likely they are to be unbound from the Galaxy. We used the statistical\nanalysis of both the spatial distribution and kinematics of these objects to\nachieve our goals.\n  Results. Focussing on nominal Galactocentric distances greater than 30 kpc,\nwhich are the most distant candidates, we isolated a sample with speeds in\nexcess of 500 km/s that exhibits a certain degree of anisotropy but remains\ncompatible with possible systematic effects. We find that the effect of the\nEddington-Trumpler-Weaver bias is important in our case: over 80% of our\nsources are probably located further away than implied by their parallaxes;\ntherefore, most of our velocity estimates are lower limits. If this bias is as\nstrong as suggested here, the contamination by disc stars may not affect our\noverall conclusions.\n  Conclusions. The subsample with the lowest uncertainties shows stronger, but\nobviously systematic, anisotropies and includes a number of candidates of\npossible extragalactic origin and young age with speeds of up to 2000 km/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:01:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 14:50:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 15:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

Specifically, we want to identify all vital nodes,\nwhich when removed would lead to a large change in the underlying community\nstructure of the network. This problem is extremely important because the\ncommunity structure of a network allows deep underlying insights into how\nfunction of a network and its topology affect each other. Moreover, it even\nprovides a way to condense large graphs into smaller graphs where each\ncommunity acts as a meta node and hence aids in easier network analysis.

Reinforcement\nlearning excels at learning policies and the relative values of states, but\nfails to plan over long horizons. Despite the successes of each method in\nvarious domains, tasks that require reasoning over long horizons with limited\nfeedback and high-dimensional observations remain exceedingly challenging for\nboth planning and reinforcement learning algorithms.

We introduce a general\ncontrol algorithm that combines the strengths of planning and reinforcement\nlearning to effectively solve these tasks.

Using graph search over our\nreplay buffer, we can automatically generate this sequence of subgoals, even in\nimage-based environments.

A tandem\nduplication takes a copy of a genome segment and inserts it right after the\nsegment - this can be represented as the string operation $AXB \\Rightarrow\nAXXB$. For example, Tandem exon duplications have been found in many species\nsuch as human, fly or worm, and have been largely studied in computational\nbiology. The Tandem Duplication (TD) distance problem we investigate in this\npaper is defined as follows: given two strings $S$ and $T$ over the same\nalphabet, compute the smallest sequence of tandem duplications required to\nconvert $S$ to $T$. The natural question of whether the TD distance can be\ncomputed in polynomial time was posed in 2004 by Leupold et al. and had\nremained open, despite the fact that tandem duplications have received much\nattention ever since. In this paper, we prove that this problem is NP-hard. We\nfurther show that this hardness holds even if all characters of $S$ are\ndistinct. This is known as the exemplar TD distance, which is of special\nrelevance in bioinformatics. One of the tools we develop for the reduction is a\nnew problem called the Cost-Effective Subgraph, for which we obtain\nW[1]-hardness results that might be of independent interest. We finally show\nthat computing the exemplar TD distance between $S$ and $T$ is fixed-parameter\ntractable. Our results open the door to many other questions, and we conclude\nwith several open problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 17:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-13"}

Specifically, we demonstrate that for natural data distributions\nmemorization of labels is necessary for achieving close-to-optimal\ngeneralization error. Crucially, even labels of outliers and noisy labels need\nto be memorized. The model is motivated and supported by the results of several\nrecent empirical works. In our model, data is sampled from a mixture of\nsubpopulations and our results show that memorization is necessary whenever the\ndistribution of subpopulation frequencies is long-tailed.

In addition, they explain how DNNs generalize\nwell despite being highly over-parameterized, this due to an entropic bias to\nsimple functions which, for the case of fully-connected DNNs with data sampled\non the hypersphere, are low order polynomials in the input vector. Being a\ncomplex interacting system of artificial neurons, we believe that such tools\nand methodologies borrowed from condensed matter physics would prove essential\nfor obtaining an accurate quantitative understanding of deep learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 18:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 07:25:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 17 May 2020 14:22:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 12:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

Here, we unveil fundamental\ngrowth mechanisms by investigating the growth of hBN by metalorganic vapor\nphase epitaxy (MOVPE) in a wide range of growth conditions. The obtained\nresults contradict the widespread opinion about the importance of parasitic\ngas-phase reactions decreasing the growth efficiency. Two different growth\nmechanisms that depend on ammonia flow and reactor pressure can be\ndistinguished. Both mechanisms are effective in the case of polycrystalline\ngrowth, but the growth of highly ordered, flat layers, is strongly hindered.\nThe problem is caused by a low efficiency of boron chemisorption on\nN-terminated edges of sp2-BN sheets forming the atomic steps on the surface of\nthe layer. Two-dimensional growth can be activated and sustained by the flow\nmodulation epitaxy (FME) method, an alternate switching of ammonia and TEB\nflows. The success of the FME method is explained in terms of periodic changes\nbetween N- and B-terminated reconstructions at the edges of sp2- BN sheets,\nwhich restore boron chemisorption. The presented results identify the\nfundamental growth mechanisms, which is the prerequisite for any further\ndeterministic development of efficient, high-quality, large-scale hBN growth\nwith MOVPE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 18:16:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

We propose\na different perspective: a goal-conditioned trajectory can be represented by\nfirst selecting an intermediate state between start and goal, partitioning the\ntrajectory into two.

Then, for optimization, we derive a new dynamic\nprogramming equation for sub-goal trees, and use it to develop new planning and\nreinforcement learning algorithms.

These straggler tasks are known to\nsignificantly slowdown distributed computation. Job execution with speculative\nexecution of redundant tasks has been the most widely deployed technique for\nmitigating the impact of stragglers, and many recent theoretical papers have\nstudied the advantages and disadvantages of using redundancy under various\nsystem and service models. However, no clear guidelines could yet be found on\nwhen, for which jobs, and how much redundancy should be employed in\nMaster-Worker compute clusters, which is the most widely adopted architecture\nin modern compute systems. We are concerned with finding a strategy for\nscheduling jobs with redundancy that works well in practice. This is a complex\noptimization problem, which we address in stages. We first use Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) techniques to learn good scheduling principles from realistic\nexperience. Building on these principles, we derive a simple scheduling policy\nand present an approximate analysis of its performance. Specifically, we derive\nexpressions to decide when and which jobs should be scheduled with how much\nredundancy. We show that policy that we devise in this way performs as good as\nthe more complex policies that are derived by RL. Finally, we extend our\napproximate analysis to the case when system employs the other widely deployed\nremedy for stragglers, which is relaunching straggler tasks after waiting some\ntime. We show that scheduling with redundancy significantly outperforms\nstraggler relaunch policy when the offered load on the system is low or\nmoderate, and performs slightly worse when the offered load is very high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 19:37:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

When the counts of the species are sufficiently\nlarge, the dynamics of their concentrations are typically modeled via a system\nof differential equations. However, when the counts of some species are small,\nthe dynamics of the counts are typically modeled stochastically via a discrete\nstate, continuous time Markov chain.\n  A key quantity of interest for such models is the probability mass function\nof the process at some fixed time. Since paths of such models are relatively\nstraightforward to simulate, we can estimate the probabilities by constructing\nan empirical distribution. However, the support of the distribution is often\ndiffuse across a high-dimensional state space, where the dimension is equal to\nthe number of species. Therefore generating an accurate empirical distribution\ncan come with a large computational cost.\n  We present a new Monte Carlo estimator that fundamentally improves on the\n\"classical\" Monte Carlo estimator described above.

Images of objects with either flat-field or\nstructured illumination are paired with registered optical property maps and\nare used to train conditional generative adversarial networks that estimate\noptical properties from a single input image. We benchmark this approach by\ncomparing GANPOP to a single-snapshot optical property (SSOP) technique, using\na normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) metric. In human gastrointestinal\nspecimens, GANPOP estimates both reduced scattering and absorption coefficients\nat 660 nm from a single 0.2/mm spatial frequency illumination image with 58%\nhigher accuracy than SSOP. When applied to both in vivo and ex vivo swine\ntissues, a GANPOP model trained solely on human specimens and phantoms\nestimates optical properties with approximately 43% improvement over SSOP,\nindicating adaptability to sample variety. Moreover, we demonstrate that GANPOP\nestimates optical properties from flat-field illumination images with similar\nerror to SSOP, which requires structured-illumination.

In\nparticular, Resting State Networks (RSN) and more specifically the Default Mode\nNetwork (DMN) of the brain, which are defined from the analysis of functional\ndata lack a definitive justification consistent with the anatomical structure\nof the brain. In this work, we show that a possible connection may naturally\nrest on the idea that information flows in the brain through a neural\nmessage-passing dynamics between macroscopic structures, like those defined by\nthe human connectome (HC). In our model, each brain region in the HC is assumed\nto have a binary behavior (active or not), the strength of interactions among\nthem is encoded in the anatomical connectivity matrix defined by the HC, and\nthe dynamics of the system is defined by a neural message-passing algorithm,\nBelief Propagation (BP), working near the critical point of the human\nconnectome. We show that in the absence of direct external stimuli the BP\nalgorithm converges to a spatial map of activations that is similar to the DMN.\nMoreover, we computed, using Susceptibility Propagation (SP), the matrix of\ncorrelations between the different regions and show that the modules defined by\na clustering of this matrix resemble several Resting States Networks determined\nexperimentally. Both results suggest that the functional DMN and RSNs can be\nseen as simple consequences of the anatomical structure of the brain and a\nneural message-passing dynamics between macroscopic regions. We then show\npreliminary results indicating our predictions on how functional DMN maps\nchange when the anatomical brain network suffers structural anomalies, like in\nAlzheimers Disease and in lesions of the Corpus Callosum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 20:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

To address the two challenges, we formulate automatic robot design\nas a graph search problem and perform evolution search in graph space. We\npropose Neural Graph Evolution (NGE), which performs selection on current\ncandidates and evolves new ones iteratively. Different from previous\napproaches, NGE uses graph neural networks to parameterize the control\npolicies, which reduces evaluation cost on new candidates with the help of\nskill transfer from previously evaluated designs.

For the\n$\\gamma\\,p\\rightarrow J/\\psi\\, p$ process, we first calculate the\nPomeron-exchange amplitudes with the parameters determined from fitting the\navailable total cross section data up to invariant mass $W=300$ GeV. We then\nadd the resonant amplitudes to examine the effects of $ N^*_{c\\bar{c}}$\nexcitations on the cross sections of $\\gamma\\,p\\rightarrow J/\\psi\\, p$ in the\nnear threshold energy region. The $N^*_{c\\bar{c}}\\to MB$ transition matrix\nelements are determined from the partial decay widths predicted by the\nmeson-baryons coupled-channel models.

Unlike\nprevious solutions, our model redirects the gaze from an arbitrary direction to\nthe center without requiring a redirection angle or camera/display/user\ngeometry as inputs. We use a deep convolutional neural network that inputs a\nmonocular image and produces a vector field and a brightness map to correct the\ngaze. We train this model in a bi-directional way on a large set of\nsynthetically generated photorealistic images with perfect labels. The learned\nmodel is a robust eye contact corrector which also predicts the input gaze\nimplicitly at no additional cost. Our system is primarily designed to improve\nthe quality of video conferencing experience. Therefore, we use a set of\ncontrol mechanisms to prevent creepy results and to ensure a smooth and natural\nvideo conferencing experience.

In arXiv:1708.05674 the key properties for the existence of\nthese solutions (also referred to as stars or self-gravitating solitons) were\ndiscussed - which include a harmonic time dependence in the matter field -, and\na comparative analysis of the stars arising in the Einstein-Klein-Gordon,\nEinstein-Dirac and Einstein-Proca models was performed, for the particular case\nof static, spherically symmetric spacetimes.

Our analysis shows\nthat the high degree of universality observed in the spherical case remains\nwhen angular momentum is allowed. Thus, as classical field theory solutions,\nthese self-gravitating solitons are rather insensitive to the fundamental\nfermionic or bosonic nature of the corresponding field, displaying similar\nfeatures. We describe some physical properties and, in particular, we observe\nthat the angular momentum of the spinning stars satisfies the quantisation\ncondition $J=m N,$ for all models, where $N$ is the particle number and $m$ is\nan integer for the bosonic fields and a half-integer for the Dirac field.

Jets launched from or\nredirected by the accretion flow that powers them should be affected by the\ndynamics of the flow, which in accreting stellar-mass black holes has shown\nincreasing evidence for precession due to frame dragging effects that occur\nwhen the black hole spin axis is misaligned with the orbital plane of its\ncompanion star. Recently, theoretical simulations have suggested that the jets\ncan exert an additional torque on the accretion flow, although the full\ninterplay between the dynamics of the accretion flow and the launching of the\njets is not yet understood. Here we report a rapidly changing jet orientation\non a timescale of minutes to hours in the black hole X-ray binary V404 Cygni,\ndetected with very long baseline interferometry during the peak of its 2015\noutburst. We show that this can be modelled as Lense-Thirring precession of a\nvertically-extended slim disk that arises from the super-Eddington accretion\nrate. Our findings suggest that the dynamics of the precessing inner accretion\ndisk could play a role in either directly launching or redirecting the jets\nwithin the inner few hundred gravitational radii. Similar dynamics should be\nexpected in any strongly-accreting black hole whose spin is misaligned with the\ninflowing gas, both affecting the observational characteristics of the jets,\nand distributing the black hole feedback more uniformly over the surrounding\nenvironment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 22:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

The key feature of this approach is the seamless integration of a\nreduced order model (ROM) in the framework of an industrially validated\ncomputational fluid dynamics software. This is of special importance in an\nindustrial environment because in the online phase of the PGD ROM the\ndescription of the flow for a specific set of parameters is obtained simply via\ninterpolation of the generalised solution, without the need of any extra\nsolution step.

The resulting ROM is applied to several benchmark tests\nof laminar incompressible Navier-Stokes flows, in two and three dimensions,\nwith different parameters affecting the flow features.

By analysing the occupation\nscaling of the natural orbitals within the many-body state, we show that\ndoublons dynamically quasicondense at the band edges, consistent with the\nspontaneous emergence of an eta-quasicondensate. Building on this, we study the\neffect of periodically driving the system during the expansion. Floquet\nanalysis reveals that doublon-hopping and doublon-repulsion are strongly\nrenormalised by the drive, breaking the eta-SU(2) symmetry of the Hubbard\nmodel.

Using \"folding\"\ntransforms the parabolic PDE into a 2X2 coupled parabolic PDE system with\ncoupling via folding boundary conditions. The folding approach is novel in the\nsense that the design of bilateral controllers can be generalized to centering\naround arbitrary points, which admit additional design parameters for both the\nstate-feedback controller and the state observer. The design can be selectively\nbiased to achieve different performance indicies (e.g. energy, boundedness,\netc). A first backstepping transformation is designed to map the unstable\nsystem into a strict-feedback intermediate target system. A second backstepping\ntransformation is designed to stabilize the intermediate target system. The\ninvertibility of the two transformations guarantees that the derived\nstate-feedback controllers exponentially stabilize the trivial solution of the\nparabolic PDE system in the L^2 norm sense. A complementary state observer is\nlikewise designed for the dual problem, where two collocated measurements are\nconsidered at an arbitrary point in the interior of the domain. The observer\ngenerates state estimates which converge to the true state exponentially fast\nin the L^2 sense.

Our analyses show that immersed\nboundary methods (IBM) typically yield a first-order accuracy when the\nregularized delta-function is employed to interpolate velocity from the\nEulerian to Lagrangian mesh, and the resulting boundary force back to the\nEulerian mesh. This first order in accuracy for IBM is observed for both the\nlocal velocity and hydrodynamic force/torque, apparently different from the\nsecond-order accuracy sometimes claimed in the literature. Another serious\nproblem of immersed boundary methods is that the local stress within the\ndiffused fluid-solid interface tends to be significantly underestimated. On the\nother hand, the interpolated bounce-back generally possesses a second-order\naccuracy for velocity, hydrodynamic force/torque, and local stress field.

However, in the past few years, very few positive results have\nbeen established.

Despite the rapid development of one-dimensional temporal point\nprocesses for discrete event data, the study of spatial-temporal aspects of\nsuch data is relatively scarce. Our model captures complex spatio-temporal\ndependence between discrete events by carefully design a mixture of\nheterogeneous Gaussian diffusion kernels, whose parameters are parameterized by\nneural networks. This new kernel is the key that our model can capture\nintricate spatial dependence patterns and yet still lead to interpretable\nresults as we examine maps of Gaussian diffusion kernel parameters. The\nimitation learning model fitting for the NEST is more robust than the maximum\nlikelihood estimate.

For quantum quenches we consider two types of\ntime-dependent mass functions: end-critical-protocol (ECP) and\ncis-critical-protocol (CCP). In both cases, at early times the entanglement\nentropy is independent of the subsystem size. After a critical time ($t_c$),\nthe entanglement entropy starts depending on the subsystem size significantly.\nThis critical time $t_c$ for $z = 1$ in the fast ECP and CCP has been explained\nwell by the fast quasi-particle of the quasi-particle picture. However, we find\nthat for $z > 1$ this explanation does not work and $t_c$ is delayed. We\nexplain why $t_c$ is delayed for $z>1$ based on the quasiparticle picture: in\nessence, it is due to the competition between the fast and slow quasiparticles.\nAt late times, in the ECP, the entanglement entropy slowly increases while, in\nthe CCP, it is oscillating with a well defined period by the final mass scale,\nindependently of $z$.

Most recent efforts have been devoted to defending noisy\nlabels by discarding noisy samples from the training set or assigning weights\nto training samples, where the weight associated with a noisy sample is\nexpected to be small. Thereby, these previous efforts result in a waste of\nsamples, especially those assigned with small weights. The input $x$ is always\nuseful regardless of whether its observed label $y$ is clean.

Optical data and radar data, two important yet\nintrinsically different data sources, are attracting more and more attention\nfor potential data fusion. It is already widely known that, a machine learning\nbased methodology often yields excellent performance. However, the methodology\nrelies on a large training set, which is very expensive to achieve in remote\nsensing. The semi-supervised manifold alignment (SSMA), a multi-modal data\nfusion algorithm, has been designed to amplify the impact of an existing\ntraining set by linking labeled data to unlabeled data via unsupervised\ntechniques. In this paper, we explore the potential of SSMA in fusing optical\ndata and polarimetric SAR data, which are multi-sensory data sources.\nFurthermore, we propose a MAPPER-induced manifold alignment (MIMA) for\nsemi-supervised fusion of multi-sensory data sources. Our proposed method\nunites SSMA with MAPPER, which is developed from the emerging topological data\nanalysis (TDA) field. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that SSMA\nhas been applied on fusing optical data and SAR data, and also the first time\nthat TDA has been applied in remote sensing. The conventional SSMA derives a\ntopological structure using k-nearest-neighbor (kNN), while MIMA employs\nMAPPER, which considers the field knowledge and derives a novel topological\nstructure through the spectral clustering in a data-driven fashion. Experiment\nresults on data fusion with respect to land cover land use classification and\nlocal climate zone classification suggest superior performance of MIMA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 07:24:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

We found that the heating efficiencies are\nproportional to the product of the gravitational potential of the planet and\nthe stellar irradiation. The mean absorption radii of stellar irradiation are\n1.1-1.2 R$_{p}$ for the Jupiter-like planets while they vary in the range of\n1.1-1.7 R$_{p}$ for the planets with smaller sizes. We evaluated the absorption\nof stellar Ly$\\alpha$ by planetary atmosphere and found that the deeper\nLy$\\alpha$ absorptions tend to locate in the high stellar irradiation and low\nplanetary mean density regions, and vice versa. Moreover, planets with mass\nloss rates higher than 10$^{11} g/s$ are likely to exhibit obvious absorptions.\nFinally, we suggested that the absorption levels are related to the inherent\nproperties of the exoplanets. The planets with larger sizes (or lower mean\ndensity) show strong Ly$\\alpha$ absorptions. Neptune-like and Earth-like\nplanets tend to have weak Ly$\\alpha$ absorptions because of their small sizes\n(or high densities).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 07:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

However, estimating\nilluminant chromaticity from a single image is an ill-posed task, in general,\nand existing solutions typically employ a variety of assumptions and\nheuristics. In this paper, we present a new, physically-based, approach for\nestimating illuminant chromaticity from interreflections of light between\ndiffuse surfaces. Our approach assumes that all of the direct illumination in\nthe scene has the same chromaticity, and that at least two areas where\ninterreflections between Lambertian surfaces occur may be detected in the\nimage. No further assumptions or restrictions on the illuminant chromaticty or\nthe shading in the scene are necessary. Our approach is based on representing\ninterreflections as lines in a special 2D color space, and the chromaticity of\nthe illuminant is estimated from the approximate intersection between two or\nmore such lines. Experimental results are reported on a dataset of illumination\nand surface reflectance spectra, as well as on real images we captured. The\nresults indicate that our approach can yield state-of-the-art results when the\ninterreflections are significant enough to be captured by the camera.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 07:50:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

Such enrichment likely occurred by solid accretion\nduring late formation stages of gas giant planets in which gas accretion\ndominates protoplanetary growth. Some previous studies performed orbital\nintegration of planetesimals around a growing protoplanet with the assumption\nof an uniform circumstellar disc to investigate how efficiently the protoplanet\ncaptures planetesimals. However, not only planetesimals but also disc gas are\ngravitationally perturbed by the protoplanet in its late formation stages,\nresulting in gap opening in the circumstellar disc. In this study, we\ninvestigate the effects of such gap formation on the capture of planetesimals\nby performing dynamical simulations of planetesimals around a growing proto-gas\ngiant planet. Gap formation reduces the surface density of disc gas, makes a\nsteep pressure gradient and limits the growth rate of the protoplanet. We find\nthat the first effect enhances the capture of planetesimals, while the others\nreduce it. Consequently the amount of planetesimals captured during the gas\naccretion is estimated to be at most ~3 Mearth. We conclude that the in-situ\ncapture of planetesimals needs the initial solid surface density more than five\ntimes higher than that of the minimum mass solar nebula for explaining the\ninferred large amount of heavy element in Jupiter. For highly dense warm\nJupiters, we would need additional processes enhancing the capture and/or\nsupply of planetesimals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 07:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

The analysis of such data, especially in\nthe aspect of individualized inferences and solutions, has the potential to\ncreate significant value for practical applications. Traditionally, inference\nfor an individual in the data set is either solely relying on the information\nof the individual or from summarizing the information about the whole\npopulation. However, with the availability of big data, we have the\nopportunity, as well as a unique challenge, to make a more effective\nindividualized inference that takes into consideration of both the population\ninformation and the individual discrepancy. To deal with the possible\nheterogeneity within the population while providing effective and credible\ninferences for individuals in a data set, this article develops a new approach\ncalled the individualized group learning (iGroup). The iGroup approach uses\nlocal nonparametric techniques to generate an individualized group by pooling\nother entities in the population which share similar characteristics with the\ntarget individual, even when individual estimates are biased due to limited\nnumber of observations. Three general cases of iGroup are discussed, and their\nasymptotic performances are investigated. Both theoretical results and\nempirical simulations reveal that, by applying iGroup, the performance of\nstatistical inference on the individual level are ensured and can be\nsubstantially improved from inference based on either solely individual\ninformation or entire population information. The method has a broad range of\napplications.

In this\npaper, we introduce a novel learning structure called associated learning (AL),\nwhich modularizes the network into smaller components, each of which has a\nlocal objective. Because the objectives are mutually independent, AL can learn\nthe parameters in different layers independently and simultaneously, so it is\nfeasible to apply a pipeline structure to improve the training throughput.\nSpecifically, this pipeline structure improves the complexity of the training\ntime from O(nl), which is the time complexity when using BP and stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD) for training, to O(n + l), where n is the number of\ntraining instances and l is the number of hidden layers. Surprisingly, even\nthough most of the parameters in AL do not directly interact with the target\nvariable, training deep models by this method yields accuracies comparable to\nthose from models trained using typical BP methods, in which all parameters are\nused to predict the target variable. Consequently, because of the scalability\nand the predictive power demonstrated in the experiments, AL deserves further\nstudy to determine the better hyperparameter settings, such as activation\nfunction selection, learning rate scheduling, and weight initialization, to\naccumulate experience, as we have done over the years with the typical BP\nmethod.

We use new data to investigate and better constrain the range of\nages, the components separation and the mass ratio dependence at which the\nrotation period distribution has been significantly affected by the disc\ndispersal that is enhanced by close companions.

Nevertheless, the convolutional filters\nin these networks are local operations while ignoring the large-range\ndependency. Such drawback becomes even worse particularly for video\nrecognition, since video is an information-intensive media with complex\ntemporal variations. In this paper, we present a novel framework to boost the\nspatio-temporal representation learning by Local and Global Diffusion (LGD).\nSpecifically, we construct a novel neural network architecture that learns the\nlocal and global representations in parallel. The architecture is composed of\nLGD blocks, where each block updates local and global features by modeling the\ndiffusions between these two representations. Diffusions effectively interact\ntwo aspects of information, i.e., localized and holistic, for more powerful way\nof representation learning. Furthermore, a kernelized classifier is introduced\nto combine the representations from two aspects for video recognition. Our LGD\nnetworks achieve clear improvements on the large-scale Kinetics-400 and\nKinetics-600 video classification datasets against the best competitors by 3.5%\nand 0.7%. We further examine the generalization of both the global and local\nrepresentations produced by our pre-trained LGD networks on four different\nbenchmarks for video action recognition and spatio-temporal action detection\ntasks. Superior performances over several state-of-the-art techniques on these\nbenchmarks are reported.

In this paper, we treat the\nasset transfer problem as a concurrent object and determine its consensus\nnumber, showing that consensus is, in fact, not necessary to prevent\ndouble-spending. We first consider the problem as defined by Nakamoto, where\nonly a single process---the account owner---can withdraw from each account.\nSafety and liveness need to be ensured for correct account owners, whereas\nmisbehaving account owners might be unable to perform transfers. We show that\nthe consensus number of an asset transfer object is $1$. We then consider a\nmore general $k$-shared asset transfer object where up to $k$ processes can\natomically withdraw from the same account, and show that this object has\nconsensus number $k$. We establish our results in the context of shared memory\nwith benign faults, allowing us to properly understand the level of difficulty\nof the asset transfer problem.

The BSC-like behavior offers a\ndistance-dependent interlayer anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) to ferromagnetic (FM)\ntransition. This phenomenon is explained with the spin-exchange coupling\nmechanisms established using bilayer CrSe2 as a prototype in this work. The Se\npz wavefunctions from two adjacent interfacial Se sublayers overlap at the\ninterlayer region. The spin alignment of the region determines interlayer\nmagnetic coupling. At a shorter interlayer distance, Pauli repulsion at the\noverlapped region dominates and thus favors anti-parallel oriented spins\nleading to interlayer AFM. For a longer distance, kinetic energy gain of\npolarized electrons across the bilayer balances the Pauli repulsion and the\nbilayer thus prefers an interlayer FM state. In light of this, the AFM-FM\ntransition is a result of competition between Pauli and Coulomb repulsion and\nkinetic energy gain. All these results open a new route to tune interlayer\nmagnetism and the revealed spin-exchange coupling mechanisms are paramount\nadditions to those previously established ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 09:48:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 14:43:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 15:37:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 06:57:08 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 15:44:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

The\ngoverning equations for both models are derived by performing an asymptotic\nexpansion in the limit of a thin disc, with the different regimes isolated\nthrough setting the relative order of the leading terms between variables. Flux\ntransport rates and vertical structure profiles are calculated for a range of\ndiffusivities and disc magnetisations.

A wind outflow drives inward flux transport, which is significantly\nenhanced in the presence of Hall drift in the positive polarity case, $\\eta_H\n(\\boldsymbol{B}_z \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}) > 0$, an effect which has only\nbeen briefly noted before.

These were integrated in the supersonic part of the wind for\na sample of OB- and WR-stars. Fitting with the velocity-law gives mass loss\nrate and outflow velocity as outputs. The boundary condition of the subsonic\npart and the velocity law were approximated by using a beta-law formulation\nwith beta = 0.6 and Vin = 10 km/s.

However, existing re-ID methods are largely\ntargeted at persons and cars, which have limited pose variations and\nconstrained capture environments. This paper tries to fill the gap by\nintroducing a novel large-scale dataset, the Amur Tiger Re-identification in\nthe Wild (ATRW) dataset. ATRW contains over 8,000 video clips from 92 Amur\ntigers, with bounding box, pose keypoint, and tiger identity annotations. In\ncontrast to typical re-ID datasets, the tigers are captured in a diverse set of\nunconstrained poses and lighting conditions.

The Siegel-Shidlovskii Theorem (1956) deals\nwith the algebraic (in)dependence of values at algebraicpoints of E-functions\nsolutions of a differential system. In this paper, we prove the existence of an\nalgorithm to perfom the following three tasks. Given as inputs some E-functions\n$F_1(z), ..., F_p(z)$, (1) it computes a system of generators of the ideal of\npolynomial relations between $F_1(z), ..., F_p(z)$; (2) given any algebraic\nnumber $\\alpha$, it computes a system of generators of the ideal of polynomial\nrelations between the values $F_1(\\alpha), ..., F_p(\\alpha)$ with algebraic\ncoefficients;(3) if $z,F_1(z), ..., F_p(z)$ are algebraically independent, it\ndetermines the finite set of all algebraic numbers $\\alpha$ such that the\nvalues $F_1(\\alpha), ..., F_p(\\alpha)$ are algebraically dependent.

Accordingly, much research has been conducted to identify potential\nbarriers to increasing the use of ADs in practice, and several articles have\nargued that the availability of user-friendly software will be an important\nstep in making ADs easier to implement. Therefore, in this paper we present a\nreview of the current state of software availability for AD. Methods: We first\nreview articles from 31 journals published in 2013-17 that relate to\nmethodology for adaptive trials, in order to assess how often code and software\nfor implementing novel ADs is made available at the time of publication. We\ncontrast our findings against these journals' current policies on code\ndistribution. Secondly, we conduct additional searches of popular code\nrepositories, such as CRAN and GitHub, to identify further existing\nuser-contributed software for ADs. From this, we are able to direct interested\nparties towards solutions for their problem of interest by classifying\navailable code by type of adaptation. Results: Only 29% of included articles\nmade their code available in some form. In many instances, articles published\nin journals that had mandatory requirements on code provision still did not\nmake code available. There are several areas in which available software is\ncurrently limited or saturated. In particular, many packages are available to\naddress group sequential design, but comparatively little code is present in\nthe public domain to determine biomarker-guided ADs. Conclusions: There is much\nroom for improvement in the provision of software alongside AD publications.\nAdditionally, whilst progress has been made, well-established software for\nvarious types of trial adaptation remains sparsely available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 11:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

Assuming that this dynamical has a unique attracting\nfixed point, we analyzed in a previous work what happens for large but finite\n$K$, especially the different time scales showing up. In the present work, we\nare mainly interested in the following question: Observing a realization of the\nprocess, can we determine the so-called engineering resilience? To answer this\nquestion, we establish two relations which intermingle the resilience, which is\na macroscopic quantity defined for the dynamical system, and the fluctuations\nof the process, which are microscopic quantities. Analogous relations are well\nknown in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. To exploit these relations, we\nneed to introduce several estimators which we control for times between $\\log\nK$ (time scale to converge to the qsd) and $\\exp(K)$ (time scale of mean time\nto extinction).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 12:37:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 07:21:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 16:18:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 09:33:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-22"}

To better target their needs with specially\ntrained staff, it is vital to determine the times during which these particular\npatients present to the ED. Recent research was inconclusive regarding this\nquestion and the applied methods were limited to coarse time windows. Moreover,\nthere is little research on time variation of frail ED patients' case\ncomplexity. This study examines differences in arrival rates for frail vs.\nnon-frail patients in detail and compares case complexity in frail patients\nwithin vs. outside of regular GP working hours. Arrival times and case\nvariables (admission rate, ED length of stay [LOS], triage level and\ncomorbidities) were extracted from the EHR of an ED in an urban German teaching\nhospital. We employed Poisson time series regression to determine patterns in\nhourly arrival rates over the week. Frail elderly patients presented more\nlikely to the ED during already high frequented hours, especially at midday and\nin the afternoon. Case complexity for frail patients was significantly higher\ncompared to non-frail patients, but varied marginally in time only with respect\nto triage level and ED LOS. The results suggest that frailty-attuned emergency\ncare should be available in EDs during the busiest hours. Based on EHR data,\nhospitals thus can tailor their staff needs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 12:56:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

By extending Kraichnan's sweeping model used in hydrodynamics we derive\nthe Eulerian spacetime correlation function in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)\nturbulence. It is shown that in MHD, the temporal decorrelation of small-scale\nfluctuations arises from a combination of hydrodynamic sweeping induced by\nlarge-scale fluid velocity $\\delta u_0$ and by the Alfv\\'enic propagation along\nthe local magnetic field. The resulting temporal part of the space-time\ncorrelation function is used to determine the wavenumber range $\\Delta\nk_\\perp=[k_{\\rm min},k_{\\rm max}]$ of the turbulent fluctuations that\ncontribute to the power of a given frequency $\\omega$ of the time signal\nmeasured in the spacecraft frame.

In this work, we thus seek methods to\nsignificantly slim down the DensePose annotations, proposing more efficient\ndata collection strategies. In particular, we demonstrate that if annotations\nare collected in video frames, their efficacy can be multiplied for free by\nusing motion cues. To explore this idea, we introduce DensePose-Track, a\ndataset of videos where selected frames are annotated in the traditional\nDensePose manner. Then, building on geometric properties of the DensePose\nmapping, we use the video dynamic to propagate ground-truth annotations in time\nas well as to learn from Siamese equivariance constraints. Having performed\nexhaustive empirical evaluation of various data annotation and learning\nstrategies, we demonstrate that doing so can deliver significantly improved\npose estimation results over strong baselines. However, despite what is\nsuggested by some recent works, we show that merely synthesizing motion\npatterns by applying geometric transformations to isolated frames is\nsignificantly less effective, and that motion cues help much more when they are\nextracted from videos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 14:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

Using capping layers such as\nfluoropolymers, statistically significant improvement of mobility, on/off\nratio, and Dirac point voltage for graphene FETs have been demonstrated.

Understanding the climate dependence on the\nplanetary parameters is vital for the study of terrestrial exoplanet\nhabitability. Using an idealized general circulation model with a seasonal\ncycle, we study the seasonal response of the surface temperature and Hadley\ncirculation to changes in the orbital, rotational and radiative timescales.\nAnalyzing the climate's seasonal response to variations in these timescales, we\nfind a regime transition between planets controlled by the annual mean\ninsolation to planets controlled by the seasonal variability depending on the\nrelation between the length of the orbital period, obliquity and radiative\ntimescale. Consequently, planets with obliquity greater than $54^{\\circ}$ and\nshort orbital period will have a minimum surface temperature at the equator. We\nalso show that in specific configurations, mainly high atmospheric mass and\nshort orbital periods, high obliquity planets can still have an equable\nclimate. Based on the model results, we suggest an empirical power law for the\nascending and descending branches of the Hadley circulation and its strength.\nThese power laws show that the Hadley circulation becomes wider and stronger by\nincreasing the obliquity and orbital period or by decreasing the atmospheric\nmass and rotation rate. Consistent with previous studies, we show that the\nrotation rate plays an essential role in dictating the width of the Hadley\ncirculation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

The Rate Control Protocol (RCP) is an\nexample of such a congestion control protocol. The current design of RCP\nsuggests that it should employ two forms of feedback; i.e. rate mismatch and\nqueue size, in order to manage its flow control algorithms. An outstanding\ndesign question in RCP is whether the presence of queue size feedback is useful\nor not, given feedback based on rate mismatch. In this paper, we address this\nquestion using tools from control and bifurcation theory. We linearize the\nactual non-linear system and analyze the local asymptotic stability, robust\nstability and rate of convergence of both the design choices, i.e., with and\nwithout queue size feedback. But such analyses do not offer clear design\nrecommendations on whether the queue feedback is useful or not. This motivates\na bifurcation-theoretic analysis where we have to take non-linear terms into\nconsideration, which helps to learn additional dynamical properties of the RCP\nsystem. In particular, we proceed to analyze two non-linear properties, namely,\nthe type of Hopf bifurcation and the asymptotic stability of the bifurcating\nlimit cycles. Analytical results reveal that the presence of queue feedback in\nRCP can induce a sub-critical Hopf bifurcation, which can lead to undesirable\nsystem behavior. Whereas, in the absence of queue feedback, the Hopf\nbifurcation is always super-critical where the bifurcating limit cycles are\nstable and of small amplitude. The analysis is corroborated by numerical\ncomputations and some packet-level simulations as well. Based on our work, the\nsuggestion for RCP is to only include feedback based on rate mismatch in the\ndesign of the protocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 10:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-17"}

However, testing these theories has been hindered by the\nsparseness of empirical evidence. Here, we assimilate data from diverse\nethnomusicological sources into a cross-cultural database of scales. We\ngenerate populations of scales based on multiple theories and assess their\nsimilarity to empirical distributions from the database. Most scales tend to\ninclude intervals which are close in size to perfect fifths (``imperfect\nfifths''), and packing arguments explain the salient features of the\ndistributions. Scales are also preferred if their intervals are compressible,\nwhich may facilitate efficient communication and memory of melodies. While\nscales appear to evolve according to various selection pressures, the simplest\nh imperfect-fifths packing model best fits the empirical data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 04:29:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 11:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

Sequences encoded with constrained\nsequence codes satisfy constraints imposed by the physical channel to enable\nefficient and reliable transmission of coded symbols. In this paper, we propose\nusing deep learning approaches to decode fixed-length and variable-length CS\ncodes. Traditional encoding and decoding of fixed-length CS codes rely on\nlook-up tables (LUTs), which is prone to errors that occur during transmission.\nWe introduce fixed-length constrained sequence decoding based on multiple layer\nperception (MLP) networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and\ndemonstrate that we are able to achieve low bit error rates that are close to\nmaximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoding as well as improve the system\nthroughput. Further, implementation of capacity-achieving fixed-length codes,\nwhere the complexity is prohibitively high with LUT decoding, becomes practical\nwith deep learning-based decoding. We then consider CNN-aided decoding of\nvariable-length CS codes. Different from conventional decoding where the\nreceived sequence is processed bit-by-bit, we propose using CNNs to perform\none-shot batch-processing of variable-length CS codes such that an entire batch\nis decoded at once, which improves the system throughput. Moreover, since the\nCNNs can exploit global information with batch-processing instead of only\nmaking use of local information as in conventional bit-by-bit processing, the\nerror rates can be reduced. We present simulation results that show excellent\nperformance with both fixed-length and variable-length CS codes that are used\nin the frontiers of wireless communication systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 04:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-17"}

However, the\nclassical Noether theorem cannot be applied to study non-conservative systems\nbecause it is not possible to formulate physically meaningful Lagrangian\nfunctions for this kind of systems in the classical calculus of variation. On\nthe other hand, recently it was shown that an Action Principle with\naction-dependent Lagrangian functions provides physically meaningful Lagrangian\nfunctions for a huge variety of non-conservative systems (classical and\nquantum). Consequently, the generalized Noether Theorem we present enable us to\ninvestigate conservation laws of non-conservative systems.

Their identity as a class came in sharp contrast when the Pauli\nexclusion principle and the Dirac equation revealed the other class called\nFermions, obeying `Fermi-Dirac statistics'. Spin, and spin alone, is the\ndetermining factor of the multiparticle behaviour of fundamental quanta. This\nis the basis of the Spin-Statistics Connection. While it is known that the\noverall theoretical picture is consistent, the physical reason for the\nconnection is unknown. Further, the class difference is sensitive only to the\ntotal spin in a quantum aggregate, as spectacularly seen in superconductivity\nand superfluidity, and in the Bose-Einstein condensation of neutral atomic gas.\nCan we grasp the true reason behind the difference in the collective behaviour\nof Bosons and Fermions? An explorer's journey demanding logical and physical\nconsistency of what we already know takes us to the hidden factors in the\nrelation between spin and the statistics of quanta. The surprising answer is in\nthe domain of gravity, that too, on a cosmic scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 10:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}
