Many diverse electron spin systems have been\nstudied with a view to storing quantum information, including molecular\nradicals, point defects and impurities in inorganic systems, and quantum dots\nin semiconductor devices. In these systems, spin coherence times can exceed\nseconds, single spins can be addressed through electrical and optical methods,\nand new spin systems with advantageous properties continue to be identified.\nSpin ensembles strongly coupled to microwave resonators can, in principle, be\nused to store the coherent states of single microwave photons, enabling\nso-called microwave quantum memories. We discuss key requirements in realising\nsuch memories, including considerations for superconducting resonators whose\nfrequency can be tuned onto resonance with the spins. Finally, progress towards\nmicrowave quantum memories and other developments in the field of\nsuperconducting quantum devices are being used to push the limits of\nsensitivity of inductively-detected electron spin resonance.

Intersection numbers of said cohomology classes, whose\nrepresentatives we call twisted forms, can be shown to fully localize on the\nboundaries of the moduli space, which are in one-to-one map with Feynman\ndiagrams. We prove that when twisted forms are logarithmic, their intersection\nnumbers have a simple expansion in terms of trivalent Feynman diagrams allowing\nonly for massless propagators on the internal and external lines. For physical\napplications one also needs to study non-logarithmic forms as they are\nresponsible for propagation of massive states.

Unlike prior work, it can efficiently learn distributions\nover large domains, controllably adjust the representation rates of protected\ngroups and achieve target fairness metrics such as statistical parity, yet\nremains close to the empirical distribution induced by the given dataset.

Adopting the same\nsimulation framework, we further study the impact of RT on the LAE clustering\nin redshift space. Since we measure LAE's radial position through a spectral\npeak of a Lyman-$\\alpha$ emission, the frequency shift due to RT contaminates\nthe redshift measurement and hence the inferred radial position in redshift\nspace.

We show that the\npredicted nontrivial topology of the two lowest flat bands of twisted bilayer\ngraphene plays an important role in the enhancement of the superfluid weight\nand hence of superconductivity. We derive the superfluid weight (phase\nstiffness) of the TBLG superconducting flat bands with a uniform pairing, and\nshow that it can be expressed as an integral of the Fubini-Study metric of the\nflat bands. This mirrors results already obtained for nonzero Chern number\nbands even though the TBLG flat bands have zero Chern number. We further show\nthe metric integral is lower bounded by the topological $C_{2z}T$ Wilson loop\nwinding number of the TBLG flat bands, which renders the superfluid weight has\na topological lower bound proportional to the pairing gap. In contrast, trivial\nflat bands have a zero superfluid weight. The superfluid weight is crucial in\ndetermining the BKT transition temperature of the superconductor. Based on the\ntransition temperature measured in TBLG experiments, we estimate the\ntopological contribution of the superfluid weight in TBLG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 18:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

Yet, candidate actions often have similar parts (e.g. common\ntrajectory parts), which are however evaluated separately for each candidate.\nMoreover, calculating the information-theoretic term involves a costly\ndeterminant computation of the entire information (covariance) matrix which is\nO(n^3) with n being dimension of the state or costly Schur complement\noperations if only marginal posterior covariance of certain variables is of\ninterest. Our approach, rAMDL-Tree, extends our previous BSP method rAMDL, by\nexploiting incremental covariance calculation and performing calculation re-use\nbetween common parts of non-myopic candidate actions, such that these parts are\nevaluated only once, in contrast to existing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 18:58:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-08"}

Due to the lack of experimental data at\nastrophysical energies, extrapolation and microscopic methods are needed to\nmodel fusion probabilities.\n  Purpose: To investigate deep sub-barrier $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C fusion cross\nsections and establish trends for the $S$ factor.\n  Method: Microscopic methods based on static Hartree-Fock (HF) and\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) mean-field theory are used to obtain\n$^{12}$C+$^{12}$C ion-ion fusion potentials. Fusion cross sections and\nastrophysical $S$ factors are then calculated using the incoming wave boundary\ncondition (IWBC) method.\n  Results: Both density-constrained frozen Hartree-Fock (DCFHF) and\ndensity-constrained TDHF (DC-TDHF) predict a rising $S$ factor at low energies,\nwith DC-TDHF predicting a slight damping in the deep sub-barrier region\n($\\approx1$~MeV). Comparison between DC-TDHF calculations and maximum\nexperimental cross-sections in the resonance peaks are good. However the\ndiscrepancy in experimental low energy results inhibits interpretation of the\ntrend.\n  Conclusions: Using the fully microscopic DCFHF and DC-TDHF methods, no $S$\nfactor maximum is observed in the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C fusion reaction. In\naddition, no extreme sub-barrier hindrance is predicted at low energies. The\ndevelopment of a microscopic theory of fusion including resonance effects, as\nwell as further experiments at lower energies must be done before the deep\nsub-barrier behavior of the reaction can be established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 19:32:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

Our\nframework introduces measures of non-stoquasticity that -- as we demonstrate\nanalytically and numerically -- at the same time provide a practically relevant\nand efficiently computable figure of merit for the severity of the sign\nproblem.

Complementing this pragmatic mindset, we prove that easing\nthe sign problem in terms of those measures is in general an NP-complete task\nfor nearest-neighbour Hamiltonians and simple basis choices by a polynomial\nreduction to the MAXCUT-problem.

Both components of the data, that is, reflections from stationary\nand moving targets, are considered as signal that is needed for target imaging\nand tracking, respectively. The approach we use is to decompose the data matrix\ninto a low rank and a sparse part. This decomposition enables us to capture the\nreflections from moving targets into the sparse part and those from stationary\ntargets into the low rank part of the data. The computational tool for this is\nrobust principal component analysis (RPCA) applied to the SAR data matrix.

All simulations have the same magnetic\nfield configuration but different transition region heights. Compressive wave\npackets introduced in the photospheric portion of the simulations refract\ntowards the null and collapse it into a current sheet, which then undergoes\nreconnection. The collapsed null forms a current sheet due to a strong magnetic\npressure gradient caused by the inability of magnetic perturbations to cross\nthe null. Although the null current sheet undergoes multiple reconnection\nepisodes due to repeated reflections off the lower boundary, we find no\nevidence of oscillatory reconnection arising from the dynamics of the null\nitself. Wave mode conversion around the null generates a series of slow mode\nshocks localized near each separatrix. The shock strength is asymmetric across\neach separatrix, and subsequent shock damping therefore creates a tangential\ndiscontinuity across each separatrix, with long--lived current densities. A\nparameter study of the injected wave energy to reach the null confirms our\nprevious WKB estimates.

The most common form of combining statistics is a\nsum of SNP-level squared scores, possibly weighted, as in burden tests for rare\nvariants.

This\n\"entropy rain\" could propagate as dense vortex rings, analogous to rising\nbuoyant thermals in the Earth's atmosphere. In this work, we develop an\nanalytical theory describing the evolution of dense, negatively buoyant\nthermals. We verify the theory with 2D cylindrical and 3D cartesian simulations\nof laminar, axisymmetric thermals in highly stratified atmospheres. Our results\nshow that dense thermals fall in two categories: a stalling regime in which the\ndroplets slow down and expand, and a falling regime in which the droplets\naccelerate and shrink as they propagate downwards. We estimate that solar\ndownflows are in the falling regime and maintain their entropy perturbation\nagainst diffusion until they reach the base of the convection zone.

However, some of the most\npopular CNN architectures for image segmentation still rely on post-processing\nstrategies (e.g. Conditional Random Fields) to incorporate connectivity\nconstraints into the resulting masks. These post-processing steps are based on\nthe assumption that objects are usually continuous and therefore nearby pixels\nshould be assigned the same object label. Even if it is a valid assumption in\ngeneral, these methods do not offer a straightforward way to incorporate more\ncomplex priors like convexity or arbitrary shape restrictions. In this work we\npropose Post-DAE, a post-processing method based on denoising autoencoders\n(DAE) trained using only segmentation masks. We learn a low-dimensional space\nof anatomically plausible segmentations, and use it as a post-processing step\nto impose shape constraints on the resulting masks obtained with arbitrary\nsegmentation methods. Our approach is independent of image modality and\nintensity information since it employs only segmentation masks for training.\nThis enables the use of anatomical segmentations that do not need to be paired\nwith intensity images, making the approach very flexible. Our experimental\nresults on anatomical segmentation of X-ray images show that Post-DAE can\nimprove the quality of noisy and incorrect segmentation masks obtained with a\nvariety of standard methods, by bringing them back to a feasible space, with\nalmost no extra computational time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 22:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-07"}

Our key insight is that items with similar\nphysical properties will exhibit similar success rates across an action space,\nallowing the robot to generalize its actions to previously unseen items. To\nbetter understand which skewering strategy works best for each food item, we\ncollected a dataset of 2450 robot bite acquisition trials for 16 food items\nwith varying properties. Analyzing the dataset provided insights into how the\nfood items' surrounding environment, fork pitch, and fork roll angles affect\nbite acquisition success.

Many quantum algorithms make use of\nso-called oracles that implement Boolean functions and are queried with highly\nsuperposed input states in order to evaluate the implemented Boolean function\nfor many different input patterns in parallel. To simplify or enable a\nrealization of these oracles in quantum logic in the first place, the Boolean\nreversible functions to be realized usually need to be broken down into several\nnon-reversible sub-functions. However, since quantum logic is inherently\nreversible, these sub-functions have to be realized in a reversible fashion by\nadding further qubits in order to make the output patterns distinguishable (a\nprocess that is also known as embedding). This usually results in a significant\nincrease of the qubits required in total. In this work, we show how this\noverhead can be significantly reduced by utilizing coding. More precisely, we\nprove that one additional qubit is always enough to embed any non-reversible\nfunction into a reversible one by using a variable-length encoding of the\noutput patterns. Moreover, we characterize those functions that do not require\nan additional qubit at all. The made observations show that coding often allows\none to undercut the usually considered minimum of additional qubits in\nsub-functions of oracles by far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 23:08:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-07"}

Unfortunately, such sharing can cause Flush+Reload\ncache attacks, whereby a spy periodically flushes a cache line of shared data\n(using the clflush instruction) and reloads it to infer the access patterns of\na victim application. Current proposals to mitigate Flush+Reload attacks are\nimpractical as they either disable page sharing, or require application\nrewrite, or require OS support, or incur ISA changes. Ideally, we want to\ntolerate attacks without requiring any OS or ISA support and while incurring\nnegligible performance and storage overheads.\n  This paper makes the key observation that when a cache line is invalidated\ndue to a Flush-Caused Invalidation (FCI), the tag and data of the invalidated\nline are still resident in the cache and can be used for detecting Flush-based\nattacks. We call lines invalidated due to FCI as Zombie lines. Our design\nexplicitly marks such lines as Zombies, preserves the Zombie lines in the\ncache, and uses the hits and misses to Zombie lines to tolerate the attacks. We\npropose Zombie-Based Mitigation (ZBM), a simple hardware-based design that\nsuccessfully guards against attacks by simply treating hits on Zombie-lines as\nmisses to avoid any timing leaks to the attacker. We analyze the robustness of\nZBM using three spy programs: attacking AES T-Tables, attacking RSA\nSquare-and-Multiply, and Function Watcher (FW), and show that ZBM successfully\ndefends against these attacks.

Solid-state cooling consists of applying external fields\non caloric materials, which react thermally as a result of induced phase\ntransformations. From an energy efficiency point of view, mechanocaloric\ncompounds, in which the phase transitions of interest are driven by mechanical\nstresses, probably represent the most encouraging type of caloric materials.\nConventional mechanocaloric materials like shape-memory alloys already display\ngood cooling performances however in most cases they also present critical\nmechanical fatigue and hysteresis problems that limit their applicability.\nFinding new mechanocaloric materials and mechanisms able to overcome those\nproblems while simultaneously rendering large temperature shifts, is necessary\nto further advance the field of solid-state cooling.

In particular, we are interested\nin generating longer, richer and more fine-grained sentences and paragraphs as\nimage descriptions. Image captioning can be translated to the task of\nsequential language prediction given visual content, where the output sequence\nforms natural language description with plausible grammar. However, existing\nimage captioning methods focus only on language policy while not visual policy,\nand thus fail to capture visual context that are crucial for compositional\nreasoning such as object relationships (e.g., \"man riding horse\") and visual\ncomparisons (e.g., \"small(er) cat\"). This issue is especially severe when\ngenerating longer sequences such as a paragraph. To fill the gap, we propose a\nContext-Aware Visual Policy network (CAVP) for fine-grained image-to-language\ngeneration: image sentence captioning and image paragraph captioning. During\ncaptioning, CAVP explicitly considers the previous visual attentions as\ncontext, and decides whether the context is used for the current word/sentence\ngeneration given the current visual attention. Compared against traditional\nvisual attention mechanism that only fixes a single visual region at each step,\nCAVP can attend to complex visual compositions over time. The whole image\ncaptioning model -- CAVP and its subsequent language policy network -- can be\nefficiently optimized end-to-end by using an actor-critic policy gradient\nmethod.

In this case, pairs of the\nsignal (i.e., code symbol) and observation are not jointly Gaussian and\ntherefore, a linear estimation method cannot be applied. Hence, in this paper,\nnon-linear estimation of convolutionally encoded sequences is discussed. First\na probability measure (denoted Q), whose Radon-Nikodym derivative with respect\nto the underlying probability measure P is an exponential martingale, is\nconstructed. It is shown that with respect to Q, the observations are mutually\nindependent Gaussian random vectors with zero mean and identity covariance\nmatrix. We see that the relationship between observation noises (with respect\nto P) and observations (with respect to Q) has a close relation to the Girsanov\ntheorem in continuous case. Next, using the probability measure Q, we calculate\nthe conditional probability of an event related to any encoded symbol\nconditioned by the observations. Moreover, we transform it into a recursive\nform. In the process of derivation, the metric associated with an encoded\nsequence comes out in a natural way.

These problems tend to\nbe under-constrained and require regularization to impose additional structure\non the solution in parameter space. A central difficulty in regularization is\nturning a complex conceptual model of this additional structure into a\nfunctional mathematical form to be used in the inverse analysis. In this work\nwe propose a method of regularization involving a machine learning technique\nknown as a variational autoencoder (VAE). The VAE is trained to map a\nlow-dimensional set of latent variables with a simple structure to the\nhigh-dimensional parameter space that has a complex structure. We train a VAE\non unconditioned realizations of the parameters for a hydrological inverse\nproblem. These unconditioned realizations neither rely on the observational\ndata used to perform the inverse analysis nor require any forward runs of the\nphysical model, thus making the computational cost of generating the training\ndata minimal. The central benefit of this approach is that regularization is\nthen performed on the latent variables from the VAE, which can be regularized\nsimply. A second benefit of this approach is that the VAE reduces the number of\nvariables in the optimization problem, thus making gradient-based optimization\nmore computationally efficient when adjoint methods are unavailable. After\nperforming regularization and optimization on the latent variables, the VAE\nthen decodes the problem back to the original parameter space. Our approach\nconstitutes a novel framework for regularization and optimization, readily\napplicable to a wide range of inverse problems.

The segmentation of skin lesions is a\ncornerstone task for automated skin lesion analysis, useful both as an\nend-result to locate/detect the lesions and as an ancillary task for lesion\nclassification.

This paper proposes a system, Zorro, which aims to\nrectify aforementioned two problems.\n  As the main contribution, we provide a natural, 'absolute' definition of\n'Value of Data' (VoD) - for any quantity of interest, it is the delta between\nan individual's value and population mean. The challenge remains how to\noperationalize this definition, independently of a buyer's model for VoD.

(2) We then perform a large-scale\n$N$-body and radiative transfer simulation that accounts for this inhomogeneous\nsubgrid clumping by applying this clumping factor-overdensity correlation.\nBoosting recombination significantly slows the expansion of ionized regions,\nwhich delays completion of reionization and suppresses 21 cm power spectra on\nlarge scales in the later stages of reionization. (3) We also consider a\nsimplified prescription in which the globally-averaged, time-evolving clumping\nfactor from the same high-resolution $N$-body simulation is applied uniformly\nto all cells in the reionization simulation, instead.

Their two most\nwell-known properties are that learning dynamics converge to equilibria and\nthat all equilibria are approximately optimal. In this work, we perform a\nstress test for these classic results by studying the ubiquitous dynamics,\nMultiplicative Weights Update, in different classes of congestion games,\nuncovering intricate non-equilibrium phenomena. As the system demand increases,\nthe learning dynamics go through period-doubling bifurcations, leading to\ninstabilities, chaos and large inefficiencies even in the simplest case of\nnon-atomic routing games with two paths of linear cost where the Price of\nAnarchy is equal to one.\n  Starting with this simple class, we show that every system has a carrying\ncapacity, above which it becomes unstable. If the equilibrium flow is a\nsymmetric $50-50\\%$ split, the system exhibits one period-doubling bifurcation.\nA single periodic attractor of period two replaces the attracting fixed point.\nAlthough the Price of Anarchy is equal to one, in the large population limit\nthe time-average social cost for all but a zero measure set of initial\nconditions converges to its worst possible value. For asymmetric equilibrium\nflows, increasing the demand eventually forces the system into Li-Yorke chaos\nwith positive topological entropy and periodic orbits of all possible periods.\nRemarkably, in all non-equilibrating regimes, the time-average flows on the\npaths converge exactly to the equilibrium flows, a property akin to no-regret\nlearning in zero-sum games. These results are robust. We extend them to routing\ngames with arbitrarily many strategies, polynomial cost functions, non-atomic\nas well as atomic routing games and heteregenous users. Our results are also\napplicable to any sequence of shrinking learning rates, e.g., $1/\\sqrt{T}$, by\nallowing for a dynamically increasing population size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 09:07:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2019 17:10:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}

However, the benefits of mmW are limited\nby the fact that the channel between a mmW access point and the user equipment\ncan stochastically change due to severe blockage of mmW links by obstacles such\nas the human body. Thus, one main challenge of mmW network coverage is to\nenable directional line-of-sight links between access points and mobile\ndevices. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for optimizing mmW\nnetwork coverage within hotspots and in-venue regions, while being cognizant of\nthe body blockage of the network's users. In the studied model, the locations\nof potential access points and users are assumed as predefined parameters while\nthe orientation of the users is assumed to be stochastic. Hence, a joint\nstochastic access point placement and beam steering problem subjected to\nstochastic users' body blockage is formulated, under desired network coverage\nconstraints. Then, a greedy algorithm is introduced to find an approximation\nsolution for the joint deployment and assignment problem using a new `size\nconstrained weighted set cover' approach. A closed-form expression for the\nratio between the optimal solution and approximate one (resulting from the\ngreedy algorithm) is analytically derived. The proposed algorithm is simulated\nfor three in-venue regions: the meeting room in the Alumni Assembly Hall of\nVirginia Tech, an airport gate, and one side of a stadium football. Simulation\nresults show that, in order to guarantee network coverage for different\nin-venue regions, the greedy algorithm uses at most three more access points\n(APs) compared to the optimal solution. The results also show that, due to the\nuse of the additional APs, the greedy algorithm will yield a network coverage\nup to 11.7 % better than the optimal, AP-minimizing solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 09:17:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-07"}

Ultimately the\nbackground metric it formally depends on is selected self-consistently by means\nof a suitable generalization of Einstein's equation. Self-consistent backround\nspacetimes are scale dependent, and therefore \"going on-shell\" at the points\nalong a given renormalization group (RG) trajectory requires understanding two\ntypes of scale dependencies: the (familiar) direct one carried by the off-shell\naction functional, and an indirect one related to the self-consistent\nbackground geometry. This paper is devoted to a careful delineation and\nanalysis of certain general questions concerning the indirect scale dependence,\nas well as a detailed explicit investigation of the case where the\nself-consistent metrics are determined predominantly by the RG running of the\ncosmological constant. Mathematically, the object of interest is the spectral\nflow induced by the background Laplacian which, on-shell, acquires an explicit\nscale dependence. It encodes the information about the specific set of field\nmodes which, at any given scale, are the degrees of freedom constituting the\nrespective effective field theory. For a large class of RG trajectories we\ndiscover a seemingly paradoxical behavior: the theory looses rather than gains\ndegrees of freedom at increasing energies. As an application, we investigate to\nwhat extent it is possible to reformulate the exact theory in terms of matter\nand gravity fluctuations on a rigid flat space. It turns out that, in vacuo,\nthis \"rigid picture\" breaks down after a very short RG time. Furthermore, we\nreanalyze, and refute the claim that the huge energy densities one obtains in\nstandard quantum field theory by summing up to zero-point energies imply a\nnaturalness problem for the observed small value of the cosmological constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 10:27:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

However, various aspects of the optical response of Frenkel\nexcitons in this regime remained largely unexplored. Here, we utilize a\nhemispheric optical cavity filled with the fluorescent protein mCherry to\naddress two important questions in the field of room-temperature polariton\ncondensates. First, combining the high quality factor of the microcavity with a\nwell-defined mode structure allows us to provide a definite answer whether\ntemporal coherence in such systems can become competitive with their\nlow-temperature counterparts. We observe highly monochromatic and coherent\nlight beams emitted from the condensate, characterized by a coherence time\ngreater than 150$\\,$ps, which exceeds the polariton lifetime by two orders of\nmagnitude. Second, the high quality of our device allows to sensibly trace the\nemission energy of the condensate, and thus to establish a fundamental picture\nwhich quantitatively explains the core nonlinear processes yielding the\ncharacteristic density-dependent blueshift. We find that the energy shift of\nFrenkel exciton-polaritons is largely dominated by the reduction of the\nRabi-splitting due to phase space filling effects, which is influenced by the\nredistribution of polaritons in the system. While our finding of highly\ncoherent condensation at ambient conditions addresses the suitability of\norganic polaritonics regarding their utilization as highly coherent room\ntemperature polariton lasers, shedding light on the non-linearity is of great\nbenefit towards implementing non-linear devices, optical switches, and lattices\nbased on exciton-polaritons at room temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 10:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-07"}

The addition\nof a Hubbard $U$-term (SCAN+$U$, $U=7.45$ eV) allows to achieve the\nexperimental band gap of 3.25 eV with a moderate increase in the lattice\nconstant, whereas within GGA+$U$ the gap is underestimated even for high $U$\nvalues.

This\nthreshold can be considered a phase transition and we compute the threshold for\nthe Gromov boundary of Galton-Watson trees and one-variable random self-similar\nand self-affine constructions. We describe how the stochastically self-similar\nmodel can be derived from the Galton-Watson tree result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 12:51:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 2019 13:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

Recently the database\ncommunity shows that the learning-based cardinality estimation is better than\nthe empirical methods. However, existing learning-based methods have several\nlimitations. Firstly, they can only estimate the cardinality, but cannot\nestimate the cost. Secondly, convolutional neural network (CNN) with average\npooling is hard to represent complicated structures, e.g., complex predicates,\nand the model is hard to be generalized.\n  To address these challenges, we propose an effective end-to-end\nlearning-based cost estimation framework based on a tree-structured model,\nwhich can estimate both cost and cardinality simultaneously.

At $5$ MPa, the samples are able to dilate. At higher\nconfinement, the aggregates show continuous compaction, displaying strain\nhardening. The stress-strain behaviour is non-linear and the exact onset of\ninelastic compaction could not be determined accurately. Measured P-wave\nvelocities show the development of anisotropy. With increasing axial strain,\nthe along-axis velocities tend to increase, while velocities perpendicular to\nthe compression axis tend to decrease (at low pressure) or remain constant (at\nhigh pressure). In samples deformed under elevated pressure conditions,\nacoustic emission event locations are diffuse. Microstructural investigations\nshow an increase in grain chipping and crushing with increasing confining\npressure, but no evidence of localised compaction could be observed.

We infer that our observations indicate that the lack of\ncementation introduces additional degrees of freedom for grains to slide,\nrotate, and reorganise at the sample-scale, precluding the existence and\nsustainability of stress concentrations beyond the grain-scale.

In classical mechanics\nthe equations of motion of a system can be derived from the Hamiltonian\nfunction, which is a quantity that describes the total energy of the system. In\nthis paper we consider a convex optimization problem consisting of the sum of\ntwo convex functions, sometimes referred to as a composite objective, and we\nidentify the duality gap to be the 'energy' of the system. In the Hamiltonian\nformalism the energy is conserved, so we add a contractive term to the standard\nequations of motion so that this energy decreases linearly (i.e.,\ngeometrically) with time. This yields a continuous-time ordinary differential\nequation (ODE) in the primal and dual variables which converges to zero duality\ngap, i.e., optimality. This ODE has several useful properties: it induces a\nnatural operator splitting; at convergence it yields both the primal and dual\nsolutions; and it is invariant to affine transformation despite only using\nfirst order information. We provide several discretizations of this ODE, some\nof which are new algorithms and others correspond to known techniques, such as\nthe alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

Given the positive benefits of\nclinical pathways, it is important to measure the concordance of patient\npathways so that variations in health system performance or bottlenecks in the\ndelivery of care can be detected, monitored, and acted upon. This paper\nproposes the first data-driven inverse optimization approach to measuring\npathway concordance in any problem context. Our specific application considers\nclinical pathway concordance for stage III colon cancer. We develop a novel\nconcordance metric and demonstrate using real patient data from Ontario, Canada\nthat it has a statistically significant association with survival. Our\nmethodological approach considers a patient's journey as a walk in a directed\ngraph, where the costs on the arcs are derived by solving an inverse shortest\npath problem. The inverse optimization model uses two sources of information to\nfind the arc costs: reference pathways developed by a provincial cancer agency\n(primary) and data from real-world patient-related activity from patients with\nboth positive and negative clinical outcomes (secondary). Thus, our inverse\noptimization framework extends existing models by including data points of both\nvarying \"primacy\" and \"alignment\". Data primacy is addressed through a\ntwo-stage approach to imputing the cost vector, while data alignment is\naddressed by a hybrid objective function that aims to minimize and maximize\nsuboptimality error for different subsets of input data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 15:11:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 21:54:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 06:02:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-18"}

The goal is to dispatch the jobs to the\nmachines in an online fashion and process them preemptively on the machines so\nas to minimize the generalized completion time $\\sum_{j}g_{i(j)j}(C_j)$. Here\n$i(j)$ refers to the machine to which job $j$ is dispatched, and $C_j$ is the\ncompletion time of job $j$ on that machine.

We first show that for the case of a\nsingle machine and special cost functions $g_j(t)=w_jg(t)$, with nonnegative\nnondecreasing $g(t)$, the highest-density-first rule is optimal for the\ngeneralized fractional completion time. We then extend this result by giving a\nspeed-augmented competitive algorithm for the general nondecreasing cost\nfunctions $g_j(t)$ by utilizing a novel optimal control framework.

Although the interpolation methods for periodic sampling have\nbeen a topic of research for a long time, there is a lack of study in methods\ncapable of taking advantage of the Lebesgue sampling characteristics to\nreconstruct time series more accurately. Indeed, Lebesgue sampling contains\nadditional information about the shape of the signal in-between two sampled\npoints. Using this information would allow us to generate an interpolated\nsignal closer to the original one. That is to say, the average distance between\nthe interpolated signal and the original signal will be smaller than a signal\ninterpolated with other interpolation methods. In this paper, we propose two\nnovel time series interpolation methods specifically designed for Lebesgue\nsampling called ZeLiC and ZeChipC. ZeLiC is an algorithm that combines both\nZero-order hold interpolation and Linear interpolation to reconstruct time\nseries. ZeChipC is a similar idea, it is a combination of Zero-order hold and\nPCHIP interpolation. Zero-order hold interpolation is favourable for\ninterpolating abrupt changes while Linear and PCHIP interpolation are more\nsuitable for smooth transitions. In order to apply one method or the other, we\nhave introduced a new concept called tolerated region. ZeLiC and ZeChipC\ninclude a new functionality to adapt the reconstructed signal to concave/convex\nregions. The proposed methods have been compared with the state-of-the-art\ninterpolation methods using Lebesgue sampling and have offered higher average\nperformance. Additionally, we have compared the performance of the methods\nusing both Riemann and Lebesgue sampling using an approximate number of sampled\npoints. The performance of the combination \"Lebesgue sampling with ZeChipC\ninterpolation method\" is clearly much better than any other combination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 12:23:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}

Variance is harder to control in a cloud\ndeployment in the presence of stragglers. In spite of this challenge, inference\nis increasingly being done in the cloud, due to the advent of affordable\nmachine learning as a service (MLaaS) platforms. Existing approaches to reduce\nvariance rely on replication which is expensive and partially negates the\naffordability of MLaaS. In this work, we argue that MLaaS platforms also\nprovide unique opportunities to cut the cost of redundancy. In MLaaS platforms,\nmultiple inference requests are concurrently received by a load balancer which\ncan then create a more cost-efficient redundancy coding across a larger\ncollection of images. We propose a novel convolutional neural network model,\nCollage-CNN, to provide a low-cost redundancy framework. A Collage-CNN model\ntakes a collage formed by combining multiple images and performs multi-image\nclassification in one shot, albeit at slightly lower accuracy. We then augment\na collection of traditional single image classifiers with a single Collage-CNN\nclassifier which acts as a low-cost redundant backup. Collage-CNN then provides\nbackup classification results if a single image classification straggles.\nDeploying the Collage-CNN models in the cloud, we demonstrate that the 99th\npercentile tail latency of inference can be reduced by 1.47X compared to\nreplication based approaches while providing high accuracy.

In the field of computer science, the modularity and\nrobustness of multi-agent systems offer significant practical advantages over\nindividual machines. At the same time, agents using standard reinforcement\nlearning algorithms often fail to achieve long-term, cooperative strategies in\nunstable environments when there are short-term incentives to defect. Political\nphilosophy, on the other hand, studies the evolution of cooperation in humans\nwho face similar incentives to act individualistically, but nevertheless\nsucceed in forming societies. Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan provides the classic\nanalysis of the transition from a pre-social State of Nature, where consistent\ndefection results in a constant state of war, to stable political community\nthrough the institution of an absolute Sovereign. This thesis argues that\nHobbes's natural and moral philosophy are strikingly applicable to artificially\nintelligent agents and aims to show that his political solutions are\nexperimentally successful in producing cooperation among modified Q-Learning\nagents. Cooperative play is achieved in a novel Sequential Social Dilemma\ncalled the Civilization Game, which models the State of Nature by introducing\nthe Hobbesian mechanisms of opponent learning awareness and majoritarian\nvoting, leading to the establishment of a Sovereign.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 17:44:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

A typical example is protein structure prediction, which takes an\nmultiple sequence alignment (MSA) as input and aims to infer structural\ninformation from it. Almost all of the existing approaches exploit MSAs in an\nindirect fashion, i.e., they transform MSAs into position-specific scoring\nmatrices (PSSM) that represent the distribution of amino acid types at each\ncolumn. PSSM could capture column-wise characteristics of MSA, however, the\ncolumn-wise characteristics embedded in each individual component sequence were\nnearly totally neglected.\n  The drawback of PSSM is rooted in the fact that an MSA is essentially an\nunordered sequence set rather than a matrix. Specifically, the interchange of\nany two sequences will not affect the whole MSA. In contrast, the pixels in an\nimage essentially form a matrix since any two rows of pixels cannot be\ninterchanged. Therefore, the traditional deep neural networks designed for\nimage processing cannot be directly applied on sequence sets. Here, we proposed\na novel deep neural network framework (called Seq-SetNet) for sequence set\nprocessing. By employing a {\\it symmetric function} module to integrate\nfeatures calculated from preceding layers, Seq-SetNet are immune to the order\nof sequences in the input MSA. This advantage enables us to directly and fully\nexploit MSAs by considering each component protein individually. We evaluated\nSeq-SetNet by using it to extract structural information from MSA for protein\nsecondary structure prediction. Experimental results on popular benchmark sets\nsuggests that Seq-SetNet outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by 3.6% in\nprecision. These results clearly suggest the advantages of Seq-SetNet in\nsequence set processing and it can be readily used in a wide range of fields,\nsay natural language processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 12:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-27"}

Recently, generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) have been able to generate images of remarkable\nquality. Unfortunately, adversarially-trained unconditional generator networks\nhave not been successful as image priors. One of the main requirements for a\nnetwork to act as a generative image prior, is being able to generate every\npossible image from the target distribution. Adversarial learning often\nexperiences mode-collapse, which manifests in generators that cannot generate\nsome modes of the target distribution. Another requirement often not satisfied\nis invertibility i.e. having an efficient way of finding a valid input latent\ncode given a required output image. In this work, we show that differently from\nearlier GANs, the very recently proposed style-generators are quite easy to\ninvert. We use this important observation to propose style generators as\ngeneral purpose image priors. We show that style generators outperform other\nGANs as well as Deep Image Prior as priors for image enhancement tasks. The\nlatent space spanned by style-generators satisfies linear identity-pose\nrelations. The latent space linearity, combined with invertibility, allows us\nto animate still facial images without supervision. Extensive experiments are\nperformed to support the main contributions of this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 17:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-01"}

The well\naccepted explanation is Mott's theory, which considers the fragmentation of\nshells as a random process controlled by defects. However, Mott's theory is\ninadequate due to its assumption of energy conversion, and it is incapable of\nexplaining the lack of change in saturation fragment length with the increase\nin expansion velocity. In this paper, we present a theory to explain the\nphysical mechanism for fragmentation of shells and propose a highly efficient\nmodel for predicting the number of necks after fragmentation. We recognize that\nthe fragmentation problem in shells is analogous to the cracking behavior of\ntree bark, and closed form solutions is obtained to describe the relationship\nbetween the expansion velocity and the number of necks with consideration of\nthe strain rate dependent strength of the shell material.
