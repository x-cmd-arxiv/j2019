Stochastic input transformation methods have been proposed, where\nthe idea is to recover the image from adversarial attack by random\ntransformation, and to take the majority vote as consensus among the random\nsamples. However, the transformation improves the accuracy on adversarial\nimages at the expense of the accuracy on clean images. While it is intuitive\nthat the accuracy on clean images would deteriorate, the exact mechanism in\nwhich how this occurs is unclear. In this paper, we study the distribution of\nsoftmax induced by stochastic transformations. We observe that with random\ntransformations on the clean images, although the mass of the softmax\ndistribution could shift to the wrong class, the resulting distribution of\nsoftmax could be used to correct the prediction. Furthermore, on the\nadversarial counterparts, with the image transformation, the resulting shapes\nof the distribution of softmax are similar to the distributions from the clean\nimages. With these observations, we propose a method to improve existing\ntransformation-based defenses. We train a separate lightweight distribution\nclassifier to recognize distinct features in the distributions of softmax\noutputs of transformed images. Our empirical studies show that our distribution\nclassifier, by training on distributions obtained from clean images only,\noutperforms majority voting for both clean and adversarial images.

Simultaneous aggregation of each client's traffic\nacross multiple such radio access technologies (RATs) / base stations (BSs) can\nsignificantly increase the system throughput, and has become an important\nfeature of cellular standards on multi-RAT integration. Distributed algorithms\nthat can realize the full potential of this aggregation are thus of great\nimportance to operators.

Our goal is to ensure that the resources at each BS are allocated so\nthat the aggregate throughput achieved by each client across its RATs satisfies\na proportional fairness (PF) criterion.

For guiding our IS to obtain better object\nperformance, we explore issues of instance imbalance and class importance in\ndatasets, which frequently occur and bring adverse effect on detection\nperformance. To this end, we propose a novel Progressive and Selective\nInstance-Switching (PSIS) method to augment training data for object detection.\nThe proposed PSIS enhances instance balance by combining selective re-sampling\nwith a class-balanced loss, and considers class importance by progressively\naugmenting training dataset guided by detection performance. The experiments\nare conducted on the challenging MS COCO benchmark, and results demonstrate our\nPSIS brings clear improvement over various state-of-the-art detectors (e.g.,\nFaster R-CNN, FPN, Mask R-CNN and SNIPER), showing the superiority and\ngenerality of our PSIS.

This\npaper investigates existing research which uses or describes coroutines on\nresource-constrained platforms. The existing research is analysed with regard\nto: software platform, hardware platform and capacity; use cases and intended\nbenefits; and the application programming interface design used for coroutines.\nA systematic mapping study was performed, to select studies published between\n2007 and 2018 which contained original research into the application of\ncoroutines on resource-constrained platforms. An initial set of 566 candidate\npapers were reduced to only 35 after filters were applied, revealing the\nfollowing taxonomy. The C & C++ programming languages were used by 22 studies\nout of 35. As regards hardware, 16 studies used 8- or 16-bit processors while\n13 used 32-bit processors. The four most common use cases were concurrency (17\npapers), network communication (15), sensor readings (9) and data flow (7).

RCP estimates it's fair rate from two forms of\nfeedback: rate mismatch and queue size. An important design question that\nremains open in RCP is whether the presence of queue size feedback is helpful,\ngiven the presence of feedback from rate mismatch. The feedback from routers to\nend-systems is time delayed, and may introduce instabilities and complex\nnon-linear dynamics. Delay dynamical systems are often modeled using delay\ndifferential equations to facilitate a mathematical analysis of their\nperformance and dynamics. The RCP models with and without queue size feedback\ngive rise to two distinct non-linear delay differential equations. Earlier work\non this design question was based on methods of linear systems theory. For\nfurther progress, it is quite natural to employ nonlinear techniques. In this\nstudy, we approach this design question using tools from control and\nbifurcation theory. The analytical results reveal that the removal of queue\nfeedback could enhance both stability and convergence properties. Further,\nusing Poincar\\'{e} normal forms and center manifold theory, we investigate two\nnonlinear properties, namely, the type of Hopf bifurcation and the asymptotic\nstability of the bifurcating limit cycles. We show that the presence of queue\nfeedback in the RCP can lead to a sub-critical Hopf bifurcation, which would\ngive rise either to the onset of large amplitude limit cycles or to unstable\nlimit cycles. Whereas, in the absence of queue feedback, the Hopf bifurcation\nis always super-critical and the bifurcating limit cycles are stable. The\nanalysis is complemented with computations and some packet-level simulations as\nwell. In terms of design, our study suggests that the presence of both forms of\nfeedback may be detrimental to the performance of RCP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2019 09:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

However, these\nvision-based approaches simply associate words with entire images, which are\nconstrained to translate concrete words and require object-centered images. We\nhumans can understand words better when they are within a sentence with\ncontext. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to utilize images and their\nassociated captions to address the limitations of previous approaches. We\npropose a multi-lingual caption model trained with different mono-lingual\nmultimodal data to map words in different languages into joint spaces. Two\ntypes of word representation are induced from the multi-lingual caption model:\nlinguistic features and localized visual features. The linguistic feature is\nlearned from the sentence contexts with visual semantic constraints, which is\nbeneficial to learn translation for words that are less visual-relevant. The\nlocalized visual feature is attended to the region in the image that correlates\nto the word, so that it alleviates the image restriction for salient visual\nrepresentation. The two types of features are complementary for word\ntranslation.

This is\na fundamental question in the intersection of algorithms, extremal\ncombinatorics, and graph theory. It is particularly interesting in that the\nbest known bounds are algorithmic: they stem from algorithms that compute the\nminimum $k$-cut.\n  In 1994, Karger and Stein obtained a randomized contraction algorithm that\nfinds a minimum $k$-cut in $O(n^{(2-o(1))k})$ time. It can also enumerate all\nsuch $k$-cuts in the same running time, establishing a corresponding extremal\nbound of $O(n^{(2-o(1))k})$. Since then, the algorithmic side of the minimum\n$k$-cut problem has seen much progress, leading to a deterministic algorithm\nbased on a tree packing result of Thorup, which enumerates all minimum $k$-cuts\nin the same asymptotic running time, and gives an alternate proof of the\n$O(n^{(2-o(1))k})$ bound. However, beating the Karger--Stein bound, even for\ncomputing a single minimum $k$-cut, has remained out of reach.\n  In this paper, we give an algorithm to enumerate all minimum $k$-cuts in\n$O(n^{(1.981+o(1))k})$ time, breaking the algorithmic and extremal barriers for\nenumerating minimum $k$-cuts. To obtain our result, we combine ideas from both\nthe Karger--Stein and Thorup results, and draw a novel connection between\nminimum $k$-cut and extremal set theory. In particular, we give and use tighter\nbounds on the size of set systems with bounded dual VC-dimension, which may be\nof independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2019 14:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-04"}

We apply it to the generation\nof molecules and demonstrate its ability to approximate the distribution of\nequilibrium structures using spatial metrics as well as established measures\nfrom chemoinformatics. As our model is able to capture the complex relationship\nbetween 3d geometry and electronic properties, we bias the distribution of the\ngenerator towards molecules with a small HOMO-LUMO gap - an important property\nfor the design of organic solar cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2019 11:27:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 14:32:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 15:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}

The\nIMAGE-PM$_{2.5}$ model can be used as a stand-alone method of global exposure\nestimation or incorporated into more complex hierarchical model structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jun 2019 18:56:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}

However, real-world networks may have very different\nstructural properties and communities of various nature. As a result, it is\nhard (or even impossible) to develop one algorithm suitable for all datasets. A\nstandard machine learning tool is to consider a parametric algorithm and choose\nits parameters based on the dataset at hand. However, this approach is not\napplicable to community detection since usually no labeled data is available\nfor such parameter tuning. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective\nprocedure allowing to tune hyperparameters of any given community detection\nalgorithm without requiring any labeled data. The core idea is to generate a\nsynthetic network with properties similar to a given real-world one, but with\nknown communities. It turns out that tuning parameters on such synthetic graph\nalso improves the quality for a given real-world network. To illustrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we show significant improvements\nobtained for several well-known parametric community detection algorithms on a\nvariety of synthetic and real-world datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2019 12:05:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Jun 2019 18:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

The efficiency of fragment-based movement as well as the\nquality of fragment library determine whether the folding process can lead the\nfree energy landscape to the global minimum and help the protein to reach\nnear-native folded state. We designed an improved fragment-based movement,\n\"fragmove\", which substituted multiple backbone dihedral angles in every\nsimulation step. This movement strategy was derived from the fragment library\ngenerated by LRFragLib, an effective fragment detection algorithm using\nlogistic regression model. We show in replica exchange Monte Carlo (REMC)\nsimulation that \"fragmove\", when compared with a set of existing movements in\nREMC, shows significant improved ability at increasing secondary and tertiary\npredicted model accuracy by 11.24% and 17.98%, respectively and reaching energy\nminima decreased by 5.72%. Our results demonstrate that this improved movement\nis more powerful to guide proteins faster to low energy regions of\nconformational space and promote folding efficiency and predicted model\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2019 07:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

We discuss flux-normalised and field-normalised decomposition in a\nsystematic way, analyse the symmetry properties of the decomposition operators\nand use these symmetry properties to derive reciprocity theorems for the\ndecomposed wave fields, for both types of normalisation. Based on the\nfield-normalised reciprocity theorems, we derive representation theorems for\ndecomposed wave fields.
