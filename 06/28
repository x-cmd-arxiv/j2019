Besides, a\nnotable and viable election on f(R,$\\mathcal{T}$) gravity formulation is taken.\nSpecifically $f(R,\\mathcal{T})=R+2\\chi\\mathcal{T}$, where $R$ is the Ricci\nscalar, $\\mathcal{T}$ the trace of the energy-momentum tensor and $\\chi$ a\ndimensionless parameter. This choice of $f(R,\\mathcal{T})$ function modifies\nthe matter sector only, including new ingredients to the physical parameters\nthat characterize the model such as density, radial, and tangential pressure.\nMoreover, other important quantities are affected such as subliminal speeds of\nthe pressure waves in both radial and transverse direction, observational\nparameters, for example, the surface redshift which is related with the total\nmass $M$ and the radius $r_{s}$ of the compact object. Also, a transcendent\nmechanism like equilibrium through generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff\nequation and stability of the system are upset.

In particular, at $1$ AU, the magnetic field spectrum,\nobserved within fast corotating streams, also shows a clear steepening for\nfrequencies higher than the typical proton scales, of the order of $\\sim\n3\\times10^{-1}$ Hz, and a flattening towards $1/f$ at frequencies lower than\n$\\sim 10^{-3}$ Hz. However, the current literature reports observations of the\nlow-frequency break only for fast streams. Slow streams, as observed to date,\nhave not shown a clear break, and this has commonly been attributed to slow\nwind intervals not being long enough. Actually, because of the longer transit\ntime from the Sun, slow wind turbulence would be older and the frequency break\nwould be shifted to lower frequencies with respect to fast wind. Based on this\nhypothesis, we performed a careful search for long-lasting slow wind intervals\nthroughout $12$ years of Wind satellite measurements. Our search, based on\nstringent requirements not only on wind speed but also on the level of magnetic\ncompressibility and Alfv\\'enicity of the turbulent fluctuations, yielded $48$\nslow wind streams lasting longer than $7$ days. This result allowed us to\nextend our study to frequencies sufficiently low and, for the first time in the\nliterature, we are able to show that the $1/f$ magnetic spectral scaling is\nalso present in the slow solar wind, provided the interval is long enough.\nHowever, this is not the case for the slow wind velocity spectrum, which keeps\nthe typical Kolmogorov scaling throughout the analysed frequency range. After\nruling out the possible role of compressibility and Alfv\\'enicity for the 1/f\nscaling, a possible explanation in terms of magnetic amplitude saturation, as\nrecently proposed in the literature, is suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 16:16:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

Optimal transport\n(OT)-based approaches pose alignment as a divergence minimization problem: the\naim is to transform a source dataset to match a target dataset using the\nWasserstein distance as a divergence measure. We introduce a hierarchical\nformulation of OT which leverages clustered structure in data to improve\nalignment in noisy, ambiguous, or multimodal settings. To solve this\nnumerically, we propose a distributed ADMM algorithm that also exploits the\nSinkhorn distance, thus it has an efficient computational complexity that\nscales quadratically with the size of the largest cluster. When the\ntransformation between two datasets is unitary, we provide performance\nguarantees that describe when and how well aligned cluster correspondences can\nbe recovered with our formulation, as well as provide worst-case dataset\ngeometry for such a strategy.

Here we present a fast numerical method for\nsimulating the evolution of star clusters with BHs, including a model for the\ndynamical formation and merger of BH binaries. Our method is based on\nH\\'{e}non's principle of balanced evolution, according to which the flow of\nenergy within a cluster must be balanced by the energy production inside its\ncore. Because the heat production in the core is powered by the BHs, one can\nthen link the evolution of the cluster to the evolution of its BH population.\nThis allows us to construct evolutionary tracks of the cluster properties\nincluding its BH population and its effect on the cluster and, at the same\ntime, determine the merger rate of BH binaries as well as their eccentricity\ndistributions. The model is publicly available and includes the effects of a BH\nmass spectrum, mass-loss due to stellar evolution, the ejection of BHs due to\nnatal and dynamical kicks, and relativistic corrections during binary-single\nencounters. We validate our method using direct $N$-body simulations, and find\nit to be in excellent agreement with results from recent Monte Carlo models of\nglobular clusters. This establishes our new method as a robust tool for the\nstudy of BH dynamics in star clusters and the modelling of gravitational wave\nsources produced in these systems. Finally, we compute the rate and\neccentricity distributions of merging BH binaries for a wide range of cluster\ninitial conditions, spanning more than two orders of magnitude in mass and\nradius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 18:00:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 17:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-02"}

The aim of this work\nis to determine an accurate distance and metallicity for ESO456-SC38, as well\nas orbital parameters, in order to check similarities with other clusters in\nthe inner bulge that have previously been well studied in terms of spectroscopy\nand photometry. This is a considerably fainter cluster that is contaminated by\na rich stellar field; it is also quite absorbed by the dusty foreground. We\nanalyzed ESO456-SC38 based on Hubble Space Telescope photometry, with the\nfilters F606W from ACS, F110W and F160W from WFC3,and photometry in V and I\nfrom FORS2 at the VLT. We combined this with identified stars that are covered\nby Gaia Data Release 2. The isochrone fitting was carried out with the\nstatistical Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We derive an accurate distance of\ndSun = 8.75+-0.12 kpc and a reddening of E(B-V)=0.81^+0.02_-0.02.

However, if DM particles are\nWeakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), we expect them to annihilate in\nsubhalos, producing gamma rays which can be detected with the Fermi satellite.\nUsing the three most recent point-source Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)\ncatalogs (3FGL, 2FHL and 3FHL), we search for DM subhalo candidates among the\nunidentified sources, i.e., sources with no firm association to a known\nastrophysical object. We apply several selection criteria based on the expected\nproperties of the DM-induced emission from subhalos, which allow us to\nsignificantly reduce the list of potential candidates. Then, by characterizing\nthe minimum detection flux of the instrument and comparing our sample to\npredictions from the Via Lactea II (VL-II) N-body cosmological simulation, we\nplace conservative and robust constraints on the $\\langle\\sigma\nv\\rangle-m_{DM}$ parameter space. For annihilation via the $\\tau^+\\tau^-$\nchannel, we put an upper limit of $4\\times 10^{-26}~(5\\times\n10^{-25})~cm^3~s^{-1}$ for a mass of 10 (100) GeV. A critical improvement over\nprevious treatments is the repopulation we made to include low-mass subhalos\nbelow the VL-II mass resolution. With more advanced subhalo candidate filtering\nthe sensitivity reach of our method can potentially improve these constraints\nby a factor 3 (2) for $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ ($b \\bar{b}$) channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 18:47:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-15"}

Fortuitously, sometimes but\nnot always clinical notes contain sections with a heading that identifies the\nsection as a plan. Leveraging contents of such labeled sections as a noisy\ntraining data, we assessed accuracy of NLP models trained with the data.\n  Methods: We used common variations of plan headings and rule-based heuristics\nto find plan sections with headings in clinical notes, and we extracted\nsentences from them and formed a noisy training data of plan sentences. We\ntrained Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nmodels with the data.

Consequently, as shown in our background\nresearch, administrative actions (community bans and quarantines) are often\ntaken in reaction to media pressure following offensive discourse within a\ncommunity spilling into the real world with serious consequences. In this\npaper, we investigate the feasibility of proactive moderation on Reddit --\ni.e., proactively identifying communities at risk of committing offenses that\npreviously resulted in bans for other communities. Proactive moderation\nstrategies show promise for two reasons: (1) they have potential to narrow down\nthe communities that administrators need to monitor for hateful content and (2)\nthey give administrators a scientific rationale to back their administrative\ndecisions and interventions. Our work shows that communities are constantly\nevolving in their user base and topics of discourse and that evolution into\nhateful or dangerous (i.e., considered bannable by Reddit administrators)\ncommunities can often be predicted months ahead of time. This makes proactive\nmoderation feasible. Further, we leverage explainable machine learning to help\nidentify the strongest predictors of evolution into dangerous communities. This\nprovides administrators with insights into the characteristics of communities\nat risk becoming dangerous or hateful. Finally, we investigate, at scale, the\nimpact of participation in hateful and dangerous subreddits and the\neffectiveness of community bans and quarantines on the behavior of members of\nthese communities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 19:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-01"}

Since the hyperfine coupling is\nweak, it can be difficult to measure. However, an anisotropic hyperfine\ncoupling can give rise to a substantial spin-echo envelope modulation that can\nbe Fourier-analyzed to accurately reveal the hyperfine tensor.

For boron acceptor spins in unstrained silicon, both the hyperfine and\nZeeman Hamiltonians are approximately isotropic leading to negligible envelope\nmodulations. In contrast, in strained silicon, where light-hole spin qubits can\nbe energetically isolated, we find the hyperfine Hamiltonian and $g$-tensor are\nsufficiently anisotropic to give spin-echo-envelope modulations. We show that\nthere is an optimal magnetic-field orientation that maximizes the visibility of\nenvelope modulations in this case.

(2018}. 3) Component D is indeed a spectroscopic\nand interferometric double star with a relatively high-mass companion\n($q=M_2/M_1=0.5$) and period $52.90\\pm0.05\\,d$. 4) Component F, is a CP star\n(B7.5 p Si); its radial velocity, $23.2\\pm4.2\\,km\\,s^{-1}$, is smaller than\nthat of all other Trapezium members and, possibly, the evolutionary stage of\nthe star is more advanced than that of members with similar mass.

The natural development of BCRs must be understood in order\nto design vaccines for highly mutable pathogens such as influenza and HIV. BCR\ndiversity is induced by naturally occurring combinatorial \"V(D)J\"\nrearrangement, mutation, and selection processes. Most current methods for BCR\nsequence analysis focus on separately modeling the above processes. Statistical\nphylogenetic methods are often used to model the mutational dynamics of BCR\nsequence data, but these techniques do not consider all the complexities\nassociated with B cell diversification such as the V(D)J rearrangement process.\nIn particular, standard phylogenetic approaches assume the DNA bases of the\nprogenitor (or \"naive\") sequence arise independently and according to the same\ndistribution, ignoring the complexities of V(D)J rearrangement. In this paper,\nwe introduce a novel approach to Bayesian phylogenetic inference for BCR\nsequences that is based on a phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM). This\ntechnique not only integrates a naive rearrangement model with a phylogenetic\nmodel for BCR sequence evolution but also naturally accounts for uncertainty in\nall unobserved variables, including the phylogenetic tree, via posterior\ndistribution sampling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 22:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

Recent\ntheoretical studies suggest that the strong Coulomb interactions in Mott\ninsulators and other flat band systems, may provide an attractive higher\ntemperature platform for Wigner crystallization, but due to materials and\ndevice constraints experimental realization has proven difficult. In this work\nwe use scanning tunneling microscopy at liquid helium temperatures to directly\nimage the formation of a 1D Wigner crystal in a Mott insulator, TaS$_2$. Charge\ndensity wave domain walls in TaS$_2$ create band bending and provide ideal\nconditions of low densities and strong interactions in 1D. STM spectroscopic\nmaps show that once the lower Hubbard band crosses the Fermi energy, the\ncharges rearrange to minimize Coulomb energy, forming zigzag patterns expected\nfor a 1D Wigner crystal.

This limitation severely curtails the capability\nof autonomous systems in a wide range of compute, power, storage, size, weight\nor cost constrained applications such as drones.

The proposed\ntree structure allows us to derive a compressed training scheme that achieves\nsub-linearity in both required storage and inference time.

By routing all data through an anonymization\nnetwork such as Tor, we prevent the server from knowing which messages\noriginate from the same client, which in turn allows us to show that breaking a\nclient's privacy is computationally intractable as it would require solving a\nhard instance of the subset sum problem.

To efficiently aggregate information both across and within the two\npartitions of a bipartite graph, BGNN utilizes a customized Inter-domain\nMessage Passing (IDMP) and Intra-domain Alignment (IDA), which is our\nadaptation of adversarial learning, for message aggregation across and within\npartitions, respectively.

The\nsibling survival method is a leading approach to estimating adult mortality in\nthe absence of death registration. The idea is to ask a survey respondent to\nenumerate her siblings and to report about their survival status. In many\ncountries and time periods, sibling survival data are the only\nnationally-representative source of information about adult mortality. Although\na huge amount of sibling survival data has been collected, important\nmethodological questions about the method remain unresolved. To help make\nprogress on this issue, we propose re-framing the sibling survival method as a\nnetwork sampling problem.

Generation of continuous-variable entanglement or\ntwo-mode squeezing between light fields based on the effect of\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) has been systematically\ninvestigated in this work. Here, we propose a new scheme to enhance the degree\nof entanglement between probe and coupling fields of coherent-state light by\nintroducing a two-photon detuning in the EIT system. This proposed scheme is\nmore efficient than the conventional one, utilizing the dephasing rate of\nground-state coherence, i.e., the decoherence rate to produce entanglement or\ntwo-mode squeezing which adds far more excess fluctuation or noise to the\nsystem. In addition, maximum degree of entanglement at a given optical depth\ncan be achieved with a wide range of the coupling Rabi frequency and the\ntwo-photon detuning, showing our scheme is robust and flexible. It is also\ninteresting to note that while EIT is the effect in the perturbation limit,\ni.e. the probe field being much weaker than the coupling field and treated as a\nperturbation, there exists an optimum ratio of the probe to coupling\nintensities to achieve the maximum entanglement. Our proposed scheme can\nadvance the continuous-variable-based quantum technology and may lead to\napplications in quantum communication utilizing squeezed light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 03:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-01"}

We focus on\nhow quantities, such as the stacked density profiles, subhalo counts and the\nsplashback radius change as a function of different forms of self-interaction.\nWe find that self-interactions not only affect the central region of the\ncluster, the effect well known from previous studies, but also significantly\nalter the distribution of subhalos and the density of particles out to the\nsplashback radius.

In this paper, we propose a novel method, which is\ncapable of handling these two types of noises together, without the supervision\nof clean images in the training stage. Particularly, we formulate our method\nunder the framework of multi-instance learning by grouping ROIs (i.e., images\nand their region proposals) from the same category into bags. ROIs in each bag\nare assigned with different weights based on the representative/discriminative\nscores of their nearest clusters, in which the clusters and their scores are\nobtained via our designed memory module.

On the one hand, malicious parties may recover\ninterpretable source codes from the software products to gain commercial\nadvantages. On the other hand, binary decompilation can be leveraged for code\nvulnerability analysis and malware detection. However, efficient binary\ndecompilation is challenging. Conventional decompilers have the following major\nlimitations: (i) they are only applicable to specific source-target language\npair, hence incurs undesired development cost for new language tasks; (ii)\ntheir output high-level code cannot effectively preserve the correct\nfunctionality of the input binary; (iii) their output program does not capture\nthe semantics of the input and the reversed program is hard to interpret. To\naddress the above problems, we propose Coda, the first end-to-end neural-based\nframework for code decompilation. Coda decomposes the decompilation task into\ntwo key phases: First, Coda employs an instruction type-aware encoder and a\ntree decoder for generating an abstract syntax tree (AST) with attention\nfeeding during the code sketch generation stage. Second, Coda then updates the\ncode sketch using an iterative error correction machine guided by an ensembled\nneural error predictor. By finding a good approximate candidate and then fixing\nit towards perfect, Coda achieves superior performance compared to baseline\napproaches. We assess Coda's performance with extensive experiments on various\nbenchmarks. Evaluation results show that Coda achieves an average of 82\\%\nprogram recovery accuracy on unseen binary samples, where the state-of-the-art\ndecompilers yield 0\\% accuracy.

The key link in this connection is stochasticity, which\ntranslates the deterministic evolution of a dynamical system to its\nprobabilistic exploration of the state space. To-date research focuses on\ndetermining the conditions of stochasticity for particular systems. Here we\npropose an alternative agenda and prove thermalization for non-stochastic\nHamiltonian systems. This shows that thermalization happens in both stochastic\nand non-stochastic systems, reducing the need to rely on stochasticity in a\n\"coarse-grained\" analysis. The result is valid for an arbitrary classical\nHamiltonian system and does not rely on the thermodynamic limit or the\nparticular form of the interaction potential. It utilizes the property of\nadiabatic invariance, and reveals a deep relation between the structure of the\nmicroscopic Hamiltonian and macroscopic thermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 05:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-01"}

In this paper, we propose\na computation and communication decoupled stochastic gradient descent\n(CoCoD-SGD) algorithm to run computation and communication in parallel to\nreduce the communication cost. We prove that CoCoD-SGD has a linear iteration\nspeedup with respect to the total computation capability of the hardware\nresources. In addition, it has a lower communication complexity and better time\nspeedup comparing with traditional distributed SGD algorithms.

To maintain harmony and keep both the user's and\nnon-users' comfort, we propose a method that controls the VH to adjust its own\nposition to avoid such potential conflict. The difficulty to address this\nproblem is that the agent must avoid potential conflict in a natural way to\nkeep the user away from feeling unnatural.

Each legitimate source wants to communicate with its intended\ndestination node while ensuring that every WN is unable to detect the presence\nof the communication. In this scenario, we study the throughput scaling law.\nDue the covert communication constraint, the transmit powers are necessarily\nlimited. Under this condition, we introduce a preservation region around each\nWN. This region serves to prevent transmission from the LNs and to increase the\ntransmit power of the LNs outside the preservation regions. For the\nachievability results, multi-hop (MH), hierarchical cooperation (HC), and\nhybrid HC-MH schemes are utilized with some appropriate modifications. In the\nproposed MH and hybrid schemes, because the preservation regions may impede\ncommunication along direct data paths, the data paths are suitably modified by\ntaking a detour around each preservation region. To avoid the concentration of\ndetours resulting extra relaying burdens, we distribute the detours evenly over\na wide region. In the proposed HC scheme, we control the symbol power and the\nscheduling of distributed multiple-input multiple-output transmission.

Transactional access to these storage systems is an important\nabstraction allowing application programmers to consider blocks of actions\n(i.e., transactions) as executing atomically. For performance reasons, the\nconsistency models implemented by modern databases are weaker than the standard\nserializability model, which corresponds to the atomicity abstraction of\ntransactions executing over a sequentially consistent memory. Causal\nconsistency for instance is one such model that is widely used in practice.\n  In this paper, we investigate application-specific relationships between\nseveral variations of causal consistency and we address the issue of verifying\nautomatically if a given transactional program is robust against causal\nconsistency, i.e., all its behaviors when executed over an arbitrary causally\nconsistent database are serializable. We show that programs without write-write\nraces have the same set of behaviors under all these variations, and we show\nthat checking robustness is polynomial time reducible to a state reachability\nproblem in transactional programs over a sequentially consistent shared memory.\nA surprising corollary of the latter result is that causal consistency\nvariations which admit incomparable sets of behaviors admit comparable sets of\nrobust programs. This reduction also opens the door to leveraging existing\nmethods and tools for the verification of concurrent programs (assuming\nsequential consistency) for reasoning about programs running over causally\nconsistent databases.

Thus, deviation of the estimated single photon yield and single photon\nerror rate from their respective true values due to finite sample size can\nseriously lower the provably secure key rate $R$. Current method to obtain a\nlower bound of $R$ follows an indirect path by first bounding the yields and\nerror rates both conditioned on the type of decoy used. These bounds are then\nused to deduce the single photon yield and error rate, which in turn are used\nto calculate a lower bound of the key rate $R$.

Although biomarker data remains subject to substantial\nuncertainties, information extracted from this data may allow the RT plan to be\nadapted in a biologically informative way.

We use various techniques\nlike denoising auto-encoders for text, Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) for\nclickstream data, Siamese neural network architecture for image data and\ncombined ensemble over the above methods for unified embeddings.

In simple, homogeneous missingness settings with a\nnoise level of constant order, we show that an existing inverse-probability\nweighted (IPW) estimator of the leading principal components can (nearly)\nattain the minimax optimal rate of convergence. However, deeper investigation\nreveals both that, particularly in more realistic settings where the\nmissingness mechanism is heterogeneous, the empirical performance of the IPW\nestimator can be unsatisfactory, and moreover that, in the noiseless case, it\nfails to provide exact recovery of the principal components. Our main\ncontribution, then, is to introduce a new method for high-dimensional PCA,\ncalled `primePCA', that is designed to cope with situations where observations\nmay be missing in a heterogeneous manner. Starting from the IPW estimator,\nprimePCA iteratively projects the observed entries of the data matrix onto the\ncolumn space of our current estimate to impute the missing entries, and then\nupdates our estimate by computing the leading right singular space of the\nimputed data matrix. It turns out that the interaction between the\nheterogeneity of missingness and the low-dimensional structure is crucial in\ndetermining the feasibility of the problem. We therefore introduce an\nincoherence condition on the principal components and prove that in the\nnoiseless case, the error of primePCA converges to zero at a geometric rate\nwhen the signal strength is not too small. An important feature of our\ntheoretical guarantees is that they depend on average, as opposed to\nworst-case, properties of the missingness mechanism. Our numerical studies on\nboth simulated and real data reveal that primePCA exhibits very encouraging\nperformance across a wide range of scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 10:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-01"}

As a first\ndemonstration, the code is applied to the problem of an axisymmetric cold\nvertical displacement event in an ITER plasma, revealing significantly\ndifferent dynamics between cases computed with and without runaway electrons.\nThough it is not yet feasible to achieve fully realistic runaway electron\nvelocities close to the speed of light in complete simulations of slowly\nevolving plasma instabilities, the code is demonstrated to be suitable to study\nvarious kinds of MHD-RE interactions in MHD-active and disruption relevant\nplasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 11:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-01"}

On the other hand, a user running\na full node needs to pay a heavy price in terms of storage costs. E.g., the\nBitcoin blockchain size has grown over 215GB, in spite of its low throughput.\nThe ledger size for a high throughput blockchain Ripple has already reached\n9TB, and it is growing at an astonishing rate of 12GB per day!\n  In this paper, we propose an architecture based on 'fountain codes', a class\nof erasure codes, that enables any full node to 'encode' validated blocks into\na small number of 'coded blocks', thereby reducing its storage costs by orders\nof magnitude. In particular, our proposed \"Secure Fountain (SeF)\" architecture\ncan achieve a near-optimal trade-off between the storage savings per node and\nthe 'bootstrap cost' in terms of the number of (honest) storage-constrained\nnodes a new node needs to contact to recover the blockchain. A key technical\ninnovation in SeF codes is to make fountain codes secure against adversarial\nnodes that can provide maliciously formed coded blocks. Our idea is to use the\nheader-chain as a 'side-information' to check whether a coded block is\nmaliciously formed while it is getting decoded. Further, the 'rateless\nproperty' of fountain codes helps in achieving high decentralization and\nscalability. Our experiments demonstrate that SeF codes tuned to achieve 1000x\nstorage savings enable full nodes to encode the 191GB Bitcoin blockchain into\n195MB on average. A new node can recover the blockchain from an arbitrary set\nof storage-constrained nodes as long as the set contains ~1100 honest nodes on\naverage. Note that for a 1000x storage savings, the fundamental bound on the\nnumber of honest nodes to contact is 1000: we need about 10% more in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 11:32:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-01"}

Compared with other convolution networks\nutilizing standard convolution for feature extraction, the proposed method\nutilizes octave convolutions and octave transposed convolutions for learning\nmultiple-spatial-frequency features, thus can better capture retinal\nvasculatures with varying sizes and shapes. To provide the network the\ncapability of learning how to decode multifrequency features, we extend octave\nconvolution and propose a new operation named octave transposed convolution. A\nnovel architecture of convolutional neural network, named as Octave UNet\nintegrating both octave convolutions and octave transposed convolutions is\nproposed based on the encoder-decoder architecture of UNet, which can generate\nhigh resolution vessel segmentation in one single forward feeding without\npost-processing steps.

This paper introduces missSBM, an R-package fitting the SBM when\nthe network is partially observed, i.e., the adjacency matrix contains not only\n1's or 0's encoding presence or absence of edges but also NA's encoding missing\ninformation between pairs of nodes. This package implements a set of algorithms\nfor fitting the binary SBM, possibly in the presence of external covariates, by\nperforming variational inference adapted to several observation processes. Our\nimplementation automatically explores different block numbers to select the\nmost relevant model according to the Integrated Classification Likelihood (ICL)\ncriterion.

The learner in (i) is general in the sense that by construction it is\ndissimilar to the specialized learners in (ii), thus distinguishes minority\nfrom the majority without overly tuning to what is seen in the training data.\nThanks to this generality, RaRecognize ignores all future instances that it\nlabels as majority and recognizes the recurrent as well as emerging rare\nsubclasses only. This saves effort at test time as well as ensures that the\nmodel size grows moderately over time as it only maintains specialized minority\nlearners.

In general, there is no\nconservative compressible cascade since the kinetic and internal energy\nreservoirs can exchange energy through pressure dilatation. Moreover,\nstatistically stationary turbulence at high Mach number can only be maintained\nin nearly isothermal gas, i.e., if excess heat produced by shock compression\nand kinetic energy dissipation is continuously removed from the system. We\nmimic this process by a linear cooling term in numerical simulations of\nturbulence driven by stochastic forcing. This allows us to investigate\nturbulence statistics for a broad range of Mach numbers. We compute the rate of\nchange of kinetic and internal energy in wavenumber shells caused by advective,\ncompressive, and pressure dilatation effects and constrain power-law fits to\ncompressible turbulence energy spectra to a range of wavenumbers in which the\ntotal energy transfer is close to zero.

Depending on the root mean square Mach\nnumber, we find a nearly constant advective component of the cross-scale flux\nof kinetic energy at intermediate wavenumbers for particular mixtures of\nsolenoidal and compressive modes in the forcing. This suggests the existence of\na natural, Mach number dependent mixture of forcing modes.

Three sources were\ndetected with luminosities between 9X10^40 and 3X10^42 erg/s. The spectrum of\nPTF09axc is consistent with a power law of index 2.5+-0.1, whereas the spectrum\nof PTF09ge is very soft. The power law spectrum of PTF09axc and prior\nliterature findings, provide evidence that TDEs transition from an early-time\nsoft state to a late-time hard state many years after disruption. We propose\nthat the time to peak luminosity for optical and X-ray emission may differ\nsubstantially in TDEs, with X-rays being produced or becoming observable later.\nThis delay helps explain the differences in observed properties such as\nL_opt/L_ X of optically and X-ray selected TDEs. We update TDE rate predictions\nfor the eROSITA instrument: it ranges from 3 per yr to 990 per yr, depending\nsensitively on the distribution of black hole spins and the time delay between\ndisruption and peak X-ray brightness. We further predict an asymmetry in the\nnumber of retrograde and prograde disks in samples of optically and X-ray\nselected TDEs. The details of the observational biases can contribute to\nobserved differences between optically and X-ray selected TDEs (with optically\nselected TDEs being fainter in X-rays for retrograde TDE disks).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 14:19:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2019 08:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

To overcome the difficulties associated with this\nhighly nonlinear operator, we design numerical algorithms based on the\nstructures of the individual energy terms. A Fourier pseudo-spectral\napproximation is taken in space, in such a way that the energy structure is\nrespected, and summation-by-parts formulae enable us to study the discrete\nenergy stability for such a high-order spatial discretization.

The non-ideal MHD models are more\ndependent on resolution, specifically the magnetic field strength and\nstructure. Stronger magnetic fields are realised in higher resolution models,\nand the evolution of detailed structures such as magnetic walls are only\nresolved in our highest resolution simulation. In several of the non-ideal MHD\nmodels, there is an off-set between the location of the maximum magnetic field\nstrength and the maximum density, which is often obscured or lost at lower\nresolutions.

But whether this ratio evolves or remains constant through redshift\n4<z<10 is still being debated.

To reduce\nthe secrecy loss due to receiver-side correlation, this paper proposes the\nscheme of channel-correlation-enabled transmit optimization. Particularly, the\ncorrelation is viewed as a resource to acquire more knowledge about wiretap\nchannel. Based on this, the statistical distribution of wiretap channel is\ndescribed more precisely. Then, the power of AN in the null space of main\nchannel is placed more reasonably instead of simple uniform distribution and an\nelaborate beamformer for the information-bearing signal is designed. Finally,\nan efficient algorithm for power allocation between the information-bearing\nsignal and the AN is developed. Simulation results show that the secrecy rate\nunder transmit power and secrecy outage constraint is improved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 13:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

Il presente documento\npersegue l'obiettivo di studiare gli algoritmi per la categorizzazione di frasi\ne classificarle con l'ausilio delle strutture messe a disposizione dal\nframework Apache Spark. Partendo dallo studio illustrato nella pubblicazione\n\"Classifying textual data: shallow, deep and ensemble methods\" di Laura\nAnderlucci, Lucia Guastadisegni e Cinzia Viroli si \\`e voluto realizzare uno\nstudio sulla possibile implementazione di una soluzione in grado di\nclassificare frasi sfruttando i l'ambiente distribuito.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 13:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-22"}

Even though the definition expression for instanious MI versus Signal\nto Noise Ratio (SNR) is complex and the containing integral is intractable, our\nnew developed fitting formula holds a neat and compact form, which possesses\nhigh precision as well as low complexity. Generally speaking, this\napproximation formula of MI can promote the research of performance analysis in\npractical communication system under discrete inputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 03:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}
