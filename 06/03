We refer to archimedean vector lattices equipped\nwith a truncation as \\emph{truncs}. In the first part of the article we review\nthe basic definitions, state the (pointed) Yosida Representation Theorem for\ntruncs, and then prove a representation theorem which subsumes and extends the\n(pointfree) Madden Representation Theorem. The proof has the virtue of being\nmuch shorter than the one in the literature, but the real novelty of the\ntheorem lies in the fact that the topological data dual to a given trunc $G$ is\na (localic) compactification, i.e., a dense pointed frame surjection $q \\colon\nM \\to L$ out of a compact regular pointed frame $M$. The representation is an\namalgam of the Yosida and Madden representations; the compact frame $M$ is\nsufficient to describe the behavior of the bounded part $G^*$ of $G$ in the\nsense that $\\widetilde{G}^*$ separates the points of the compact Hausdorff\npointed space $X$ dual to $M$, while the frame $L$ is just sufficient to\ncapture the behavior of the unbounded part of $G$ in $\\mathcal{R}_0 L$. The\ntruncation operation lends itself to identifying those elements of a trunc\nwhich behave like characteristic functions, and in the second part of the\narticle we characterize in several ways those truncs composed of linear\ncombinations of such elements.

It was pursued vigorously over the next two decades,\nlargely by British physicists and mathematicians, in two contexts: Maxwell's\nvortex analogy for the electromagnetic field and William Thomson's (Lord\nKelvin) theory that atoms were vortex rings in an all-pervading ether. By the\ntime of Maxwell's death in 1879, the basic laws of vortices in a perfect fluid\nin three-dimensional Euclidean space had been established, as had their\nimportance to physics. Early vortex studies were embedded in a web of issues\nspanning the fields we now know as \"mathematics\" and \"physics\" - fields which\nhad not yet become institutionally distinct disciplines but overlapped. This\npaper investigates the conceptual issues with ideas of force, matter, and\nspace, that underlay mechanics and led to vortex models being an attractive\nproposition for British physicists, and how these issues played out in the\nmathematics of vortices, paying particular attention to problems around\ncontinuity. It concludes that while they made valuable contributions to\nhydrodynamics and the nascent field of topology, the British ultimately failed\nin their more physical objectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2019 17:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-04"}

The optical properties of TMDs have been shown to change\ndrastically with doping in the wavelength range near the excitonic resonances.\nHowever, little is known about the effect of doping on the optical properties\nof TMDs away from these resonances, where the material is transparent and\ntherefore could be leveraged in photonic circuits. Here, we probe the\nelectro-optic response of monolayer TMDs at near infrared (NIR) wavelengths\n(i.e. deep in the transparency regime), by integrating them on silicon nitride\n(SiN) photonic structures to induce strong light$-$matter interaction with the\nmonolayer.

The nonequilibrium morphologies, growth\nmechanisms and growth laws in the two cases are vastly different. In the low\ndensity case growth occurs via diffusive coalescence of droplets in a\ndisconnected morphology. On the other hand, the elongated structure in the\nhigher density case grows via advective transport of particles inside the\ntube-like liquid domains. The objective in this work has been to identify how\nthe decay of the order-parameter autocorrelation, an important quantity to\nunderstand aging dynamics, differs in the two cases. In the case of the\ndisconnected morphology, we observe a very robust power-law decay, as a\nfunction of the ratio of the characteristic lengths at the observation time and\nat the age of the system, whereas the results for the percolating structure\nappear rather complex. To quantify the decay in the latter case, unlike\nstandard method followed in a previous study, here we have performed a\nfinite-size scaling analysis. Outcome of this analysis shows the presence of a\nstrong preasymptotic correction, while revealing that in this case also, albeit\nin the asymptotic limit, the decay follows a power-law. Even though the\ncorresponding exponents in the two cases differ drastically, this study,\ncombined with a few recent ones, suggests that power-law behavior of this\ncorrelation function is rather universal in coarsening dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2019 19:39:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-04"}

The properties of the\nsolution closely parallel the properties of monotone travelling solutions in\nclassical bistable reaction-diffusion systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2019 21:02:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 16:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

Trajectory forecasting in the urban area is particularly\nhard due to complex interactions with cars and pedestrians, and traffic lights\n(TLs). Unlike the former that has been widely studied, the impact of TLs on the\ntrajectory prediction has been rarely discussed. In this work, we first\nidentify the less studied, perhaps overlooked impact of TLs. Second, we present\na novel resolution that is mindful of the impact, inspired by the fact that\nhuman drives differently depending on signal phase (green, yellow, red) and\ntiming (elapsed time). Central to the proposed approach is Human Policy Models\nwhich model how drivers react to various states of TLs by mapping a sequence of\nstates of vehicles and TLs to a subsequent action (acceleration) of the\nvehicle. We then combine the Human Policy Models with a known transition\nfunction (system dynamics) to conduct a sequential prediction; thus our\napproach is viewed as Behavior Cloning. One novelty of our approach is the use\nof vehicle-to-infrastructure communications to obtain the future states of TLs.\nWe demonstrate the impact of TL and the proposed approach using an ablation\nstudy for longitudinal trajectory forecasting tasks on real-world driving data\nrecorded near a signalized intersection. Finally, we propose probabilistic\n(generative) Human Policy Models which provide probabilistic contexts and\ncapture competing policies, e.g., pass or stop in the yellow-light dilemma\nzone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2019 21:06:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 16:05:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 03:17:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 23:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

To facilitate broader adaptation of seizure forecasting\nin clinical practice, non-invasive, easily applicable techniques that reliably\nassess seizure risk, in combination with clinical information, are crucial.\nWristbands that continuously record physiological parameters, including\nelectrodermal activity, body temperature, blood volume pressure and actigraphy,\nmay afford monitoring of autonomous nervous system function and movement\nrelevant for such a task, hence minimizing potential complications associated\nwith invasive monitoring, and avoiding stigma associated with bulky external\nmonitoring devices on the head.

A possible solution is weak supervision, which uses noisy\nlabels that are easily obtained from multiple sources. The challenge is how\nbest to combine these noisy labels and train a model to perform well given a\ntask. In this paper, we propose stochastic generalized adversarial label\nlearning (Stoch-GALL), a framework for training machine learning models that\nperform well when noisy and possibly correlated labels are provided. Our\nframework allows users to provide different weak labels and multiple\nconstraints on these labels.

However, the coefficients of a logistic regression model\ncorrespond to log odds ratios, while subject-matter scientists are often\ninterested in relative risks. Although odds ratios are sometimes used to\napproximate relative risks, this approximation is appropriate only when the\noutcome of interest is rare for all levels of the covariates. Poisson\nregressions do measure multiplicative treatment effects including relative\nrisks, but with a binary outcome not all combinations of parameters lead to\nfitted means that are between zero and one. Enforcing this constraint makes the\nparameters variation dependent, which is undesirable for modeling, estimation\nand computation. Focusing on the special case where the treatment is also\nbinary, Richardson2017 propose a novel binomial regression model, that allows\ndirect modeling of the relative risk. The model uses a log odds-product\nnuisance model leading to variation independent parameter spaces.

Moreover,\nin many scenarios such as health and financial applications, the datasets are\nprivate and IoTDs may not intend to share such data.

Even in\nmethods of neural architecture search (NAS) the network connectivity patterns\nare largely constrained. In this work we propose a method for discovering\nneural wirings. We relax the typical notion of layers and instead enable\nchannels to form connections independent of each other. This allows for a much\nlarger space of possible networks.

Due to the lack of recurrence structure such as recurrent\nneural networks (RNN), SAN is ascribed to be weak at learning positional\ninformation of words for sequence modeling. However, neither this speculation\nhas been empirically confirmed, nor explanations for their strong performances\non machine translation tasks when \"lacking positional information\" have been\nexplored. To this end, we propose a novel word reordering detection task to\nquantify how well the word order information learned by SAN and RNN.\nSpecifically, we randomly move one word to another position, and examine\nwhether a trained model can detect both the original and inserted positions.\nExperimental results reveal that: 1) SAN trained on word reordering detection\nindeed has difficulty learning the positional information even with the\nposition embedding; and 2) SAN trained on machine translation learns better\npositional information than its RNN counterpart, in which position embedding\nplays a critical role. Although recurrence structure make the model more\nuniversally-effective on learning word order, learning objectives matter more\nin the downstream tasks such as machine translation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 06:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-04"}

For a slowly rotating\nmagnetar, the strong magnetic field deforms the star, making it axisymmetric\nwith respect to the magnetic axis (the body symmetry axis). In magnetars, the\nrotation axis is tilted to the magnetic axis, and we have an oblique rotator.\nGeneral relativistic treatment of the obliquely rotating magnetar gives rise to\nframe-dragging velocities both in the azimuthal and polar direction. Solving\nthe Einstein equation up to first-order perturbation in rotation and\nsecond-order perturbation in the magnetic field, we calculate the geodesic of a\nparticle near the star's surface. The polar frame-dragging velocity makes the\nparticle orbit non-planar, and the particle moves both along the azimuthal and\npolar direction for a fixed radial distance. The extent of particle deviation\nfrom planar orbit depends on the magnetic field strength and the misalignment\nangle. We find that the continuous gravitational wave emitted from such\nobliquely rotating axisymmetric star is non zero, and for small misalignment\nangle, the gravitational wave amplitude depends more on the azimuthal\nframe-dragging velocity.

As the adverse effects of clickbait attract more and\nmore attention, researchers have started to explore machine learning techniques\nto automatically detect clickbaits. Previous work on clickbait detection\nassumes that all the training data is available locally during training. In\nmany real-world applications, however, training data is generally distributedly\nstored by different parties (e.g., different parties maintain data with\ndifferent feature spaces), and the parties cannot share their data with each\nother due to data privacy issues. It is challenging to build models of\nhigh-quality federally for detecting clickbaits effectively without data\nsharing. In this paper, we propose a federated training framework, which is\ncalled federated hierarchical hybrid networks, to build clickbait detection\nmodels, where the titles and contents are stored by different parties, whose\nrelationships must be exploited for clickbait detection.

Their high\namplification factor (gain) allows the detection of very low photon fluxes down\nto single photons. At the same time this sensitivity causes the gain and\nsignal-to-noise ratio to decrease with collected charge over the lifetime of\nthe PMT (referred to as \"ageing\"). To avoid fast ageing, many experiments limit\nthe PMT operation to reasonably low night sky background (NSB) conditions.\nHowever, in order to collect more event statistics at the highest energies, it\nis desirable to extend the measurement cycle into (part of) nights with higher\nNSB levels. In case the signal-to-noise ratio remains large enough in the\nsubsequent reconstruction of the EAS events, lowering the PMT gain in such\nconditions can be an option to avoid faster ageing. In this paper, performance\nstudies under high NSB with Photonis XP3062 PMTs, as used in the fluorescence\ndetector of the Pierre Auger Observatory, are presented. The results suggest\nthat lowering the PMT gain by a factor of 10 while increasing the NSB level by\na similar factor does not significantly affect the PMT performance and ageing\nbehaviour so that detection and offline reconstruction of EASs are still\npossible. Adjusting the PMT gain according to a changing NSB level throughout a\nnight has been shown to be possible and it follows a predictable behaviour.\nThis allows to extend the measurement cycles of experiments, based on PMTs of\ntype Photonis XP3062 or comparable and exposed to the NSB, to enhance the\nsensitivity especially at the highest energies where events are very rare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 09:06:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-04"}

We present evidences that\ncritical exponents appear to be built in terms of composites of anomalous\ndimensions of two Coulomb gases with distinct radii and the exponents\nassociated to $Z(2)$ degrees of freedom.

This axionic field is radiated away when the star is in a binary orbit.\nThe orbital period of a compact binary decays mainly due to the gravitational\nwave radiation, which was confirmed first in the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar.\nThe orbital period can also decay by radiation of other light particles like\naxions and axion like particles(ALPs). For axionic radiation to take place, the\norbital frequency of the periodic motion of the binary system should be greater\nthan the mass of the scalar particle which can be radiated. This implies that,\nfor most of the observed binaries, particles with mass $m_a< 10^{-19}eV$ can be\nradiated, which includes FDM particles.

Thanks to transit-timing variations, the masses and therefore the\nbulk densities of the planets have been constrained, suggesting that all\nTRAPPIST-1 planets are consistent with water mass fractions on the order of\n10%. These water fractions, as well as the similar planet masses within the\nsystem, constitute strong constraints on the origins of the TRAPPIST-1 system.\nIn a previous work, we outlined a pebble-driven formation scenario. In this\npaper we investigate this formation scenario in more detail. We used a\nLagrangian smooth-particle method to model the growth and drift of pebbles and\nthe conversion of pebbles to planetesimals through the streaming instability.\nWe used the N-body code \\texttt{MERCURY} to follow the composition of\nplanetesimals as they grow into protoplanets by merging and accreting pebbles.\nThis code is adapted to account for pebble accretion, type-I migration, and gas\ndrag. In this way, we modelled the entire planet formation process (pertaining\nto planet masses and compositions, not dynamical configuration). We find that\nplanetesimals form in a single, early phase of streaming instability. The\ninitially narrow annulus of planetesimals outside the snowline quickly broadens\ndue to scattering. Our simulation results confirm that this formation pathway\nindeed leads to similarly-sized planets and is highly efficient in turning\npebbles into planets ($\\sim$50% solids-to-planets conversion efficiency). [...]\nThe water content of planets resulting from our simulations is on the order of\n10%, and our results predict a `V-shaped' trend in the planet water fraction\nwith orbital distance: from relatively high (innermost planets) to relatively\nlow (intermediate planets) to relatively high (outermost planets).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 09:48:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2019 10:21:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

For all objects, the star formation rate (SFR) and dust mass were derived\nfrom HERSCHEL PACS and SPIRE data, and the atomic gas mass, MHI, from the Green\nBank Telescope HI observations. The complete data set allows us to study the\nrelation between the gas (atomic and molecular) mass, dust mass and SFR in\nmerger galaxies.

In turn, the good performance of\nthe steganalyzer can be restored by retraining the CNN with adversarial stego\nimages. A problem with this model is that, arguably, at training time the\nsteganalizer is not aware of the exact parameters used by the steganograher for\nadversarial embedding and, vice versa, the steganographer does not know how the\nimages that will be used to train the steganalyzer are generated.

Another\nimportant dimension of study apart from naturalness is their adaptability to\ngenerate voice from new speakers that were unseen during training. In this\npaper we first propose the use of problem-agnostic speech embeddings in a\nmulti-speaker acoustic model for TTS based on SampleRNN.

Our\ncontribution is three-fold. First, this work proposes a two-layer architecture\nto solve the large-scale load balancing problem in a self-organized manner. The\nproposed architecture can alleviate the global traffic variations by\ndynamically grouping small cells into self-organized clusters according to\ntheir historical loads, and further adapt to local traffic variations through\nintra-cluster load balancing afterwards. Second, for the intra-cluster load\nbalancing, this paper proposes an off-policy DRL-based MLB algorithm to\nautonomously learn the optimal MLB policy under an asynchronous parallel\nlearning framework, without any prior knowledge assumed over the underlying UDN\nenvironments. Moreover, the algorithm enables joint exploration with multiple\nbehavior policies, such that the traditional MLB methods can be used to guide\nthe learning process thereby improving the learning efficiency and stability.\nThird, this work proposes an offline-evaluation based safeguard mechanism to\nensure that the online system can always operate with the optimal and\nwell-trained MLB policy, which not only stabilizes the online performance but\nalso enables the exploration beyond current policies to make full use of\nmachine learning in a safe way. Empirical results verify that the proposed\nframework outperforms the existing MLB methods in general UDN environments\nfeatured with irregular network topologies, coupled interferences, and random\nuser movements, in terms of the load balancing performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 13:02:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 11:37:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 10 Aug 2019 04:47:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

While it\nhas been suggested that information transmission is optimized near the critical\npoint, it remains unclear how information transmission depends on the dynamics\nof the input signal, the distance over which the information needs to be\ntransmitted, and the distance to the critical point. Here we employ stochastic\nsimulations of a driven 2D Ising system and study the instantaneous mutual\ninformation and the information transmission rate between a driven input spin\nand an output spin. The instantaneous mutual information varies\nnon-monotonically with the temperature, but increases monotonically with the\ncorrelation time of the input signal. In contrast, the information transmission\nrate exhibits a maximum as a function of the input correlation time. Moreover,\nthere exists an optimal temperature that maximizes this maximum information\ntransmission rate. It arises from a tradeoff between the necessity to respond\nfast to changes in the input so that more information per unit amount of time\ncan be transmitted, and the need to respond to reliably. The optimal\ntemperature lies above the critical point, but moves towards it as the distance\nbetween the input and output spin is increased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 13:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

We assume that the BS is serving a multi-antenna aided\nuser equipment (UE) operating in a mmWave channel, which in the meantime\nactively detects multiple targets. Note that part of the targets also play the\nrole of scatterers for the communication signal. Given this framework, we\npropose a novel scheme for joint target search and communication channel\nestimation relying on the omni-directional pilot signals generated by the HAD\nstructure.

The PBDW algorithm is a state\nestimation method involving reduced models.

We propose several\nmethods for calibrating and combining biomarker data from nested case-control\nstudies when reference assay data are obtained from a subset of controls in\neach contributing study. Specifically, we describe a two-stage method and two\naggregated methods, named the internalized and full calibration methods, to\nevaluate the main effect of the biomarker exposure on disease risk and whether\nthat association is modified by a potential covariate. The internalized method\nuses the reference laboratory measurement in the analysis when available and\notherwise uses the calibrated measurement. The full calibration method uses\ncalibrated biomarker measurements for all subjects, even those with reference\nlaboratory measurements.

The problem\nmay be circumvented by using localized basis sets of reduced size, leaving no\nvariational flexibility for the extra electron to delocalize. Alternatively, a\nrecent approach exploiting DFT evaluations of total energies on electronic\ndensities optimized at the Hartree-Fock (HF) level has been reported, showing\nthat the self-interaction-free HF densities are able to lead to an improved\ndescription of the additional electron, returning affinities in close agreement\nwith the experiments. Nonetheless, such an approach can fail when the HF\ndensities are too inaccurate. Here, an alternative approach is presented, in\nwhich an embedding environment is used to stabilize the anion in a bound\nconfiguration. Similarly to the HF case, when computing total energies at the\nDFT level on these corrected densities, electron affinities in very good\nagreement with experiments can be recovered. The effect of the environment can\nbe evaluated and removed by an extrapolation of the results to the limit of\nvanishing embedding. Moreover, the approach can be easily applied to DFT\ncalculations with delocalized basis sets, e.g. plane-waves, for which\nalternative approaches are either not viable or more computationally demanding.\nThe proposed extrapolation strategy can be thus applied also to extended\nsystems, as often studied in condensed-matter physics and materials science,\nand we illustrate how the embedding environment can be exploited to determine\nthe energy of an adsorbing anion - here a chloride ion on a metal surface -\nwhose charge configuration would be incorrectly predicted by standard density\nfunctionals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 14:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-23"}

Furthering this\ndevelopment requires ever-increasing stability of the interferometer, typically\nachieved by improving its physical isolation from the environment. Here we\nintroduce as an alternative strategy the concept of dynamical decoupling\napplied to spatial degrees of freedom of massive objects. We show that the\nsuperposed matter waves can be driven along paths in space that render their\nsuperposition resilient to many important sources of noise. As a concrete\nimplementation, we present the case of matter-wave interferometers in a\nmagnetic field gradient based on either levitated or free-falling nanodiamonds\nhosting a color center. We present an in-depth analysis of potential sources of\ndecoherence in such a setup and of the ability of our protocol to suppress\nthem. These effects include gravitational forces, interactions of the net\nmagnetic and dipole moments of the diamond with magnetic and electric fields,\nsurface dangling bonds, rotational degrees of freedom, Casimir-Polder forces,\nand diamagnetic forces. Contrary to previous analyses, diamagnetic forces are\nnot negligible in this type of interferometers and, if not acted upon lead to\nsmall separation distances that scale with the inverse of the magnetic field\ngradient. We show that our motional dynamical decoupling strategy renders the\nsystem immune to such limitations while continuing to protect its coherence\nfrom environmental influences, achieving a linear-in-time growth of the\nseparation distance independent of the magnetic field gradient. Hence, motional\ndynamical decoupling may become an essential tool in driving the sensitivity of\nmatter-wave interferometry to the next level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 14:33:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

The theory of volume growth, starting from a stress-free\ninitial state, is widely used to explain the creation and evolution of\ngrowth-induced residual stress and the resulting changes in shape, and to model\nhow growing bio-tissues such as arteries and solid tumors develop a strategy of\npattern creation according to geometrical and material parameters. This\nmodelling provides promising avenues for designing and directing some\nappropriate morphology of a given tissue or organ and achieve some targeted\nbiomedical function. In this paper, we rely on a modified, augmented theory to\nreveal how we can obtain growth-induced residual stress and pattern evolution\nof a layered artery by starting from an existing, non-zero initial residual\nstress state.

We clarify the meaning and relevance of\nthese heuristics with analytic calculations and numerical toy models. The\nstandard usage of the term \"shadow\" describes the appearance of a black hole\nilluminated from all directions, including from behind the observer. A backlit\nblack hole casts a somewhat larger shadow. Neither shadow heuristic is\nparticularly relevant to understanding the appearance of emission originating\nnear the black hole, where the emission profile and gravitational redshift play\nthe dominant roles in determining the observed size of the central dark area. A\nphoton ring results from light rays that orbit near the black hole before\nescaping to infinity, where they arrive near a ring-shaped \"critical curve\" on\nthe image plane. Although the brightness can become arbitrarily large near this\ncritical curve in the case of optically thin emitting matter, we show that the\nenhancement is only logarithmic, and hence is of no relevance to present\nobservations. For optically thin emission from a geometrically thin or thick\ndisk, photons that make only a fraction of an orbit will generically give rise\nto a much wider \"lensing ring,\" which is a demagnified image of the back of the\ndisk, superimposed on top of the direct emission. The lensing ring is centered\nat a radius ~5% larger than the photon ring and its width is ~0.5-1M.

Models which incorporate plasma screening and\nbound-state breakup based on high-temperature quantum chromodynamics are in\ngood agreement with the centrality, transverse-momentum, and rapidity\ndependence of the suppression seen in the highest energy LHC Pb-Pb collisions.\nThe models of heavy-quark bound state breakup/formation are coupled to the soft\ndynamics of the quark-gluon plasma using 3+1d relativistic anisotropic\nhydrodynamics. At later times, excited state feed-down is taken into account\nusing independently constrained excited state feed down fractions.

This mission will encompass a very\nlarge field of view, granting it the potential to survey up to one million\nstars depending on the final observation strategy. The telemetry budget of the\nspacecraft cannot handle transmitting individual images for such a huge stellar\nsample at the right cadence, so the development of an appropriate strategy to\nperform on-board data reduction is mandatory. We employ aperture photometry to\nproduce stellar light curves in flight. Our aim is thus to find the mask model\nthat optimizes the scientific performance of the reduced data. We considered\nthree distinct aperture models: binary mask, weighted Gaussian mask, and\nweighted gradient mask giving lowest noise-to-signal ratio, computed through a\nnovel direct method. An innovative criterion was adopted for choosing between\ndifferent mask models. We designated as optimal the model providing the best\ncompromise between sensitivity to detect true and false planet transits. We\ndetermined the optimal model based on simulated noise-to-signal ratio and\nfrequency of threshold crossing events. Our results show that, although the\nbinary mask statistically presents a few percent higher noise-to-signal ratio\ncompared to weighted masks, both strategies have very similar efficiency in\ndetecting legitimate planet transits. When it comes to avoiding spurious\nsignals from contaminant stars however the binary mask statistically collects\nconsiderably less contaminant flux than weighted masks, thereby allowing the\nformer to deliver up to $\\sim$30\\% less false transit signatures at\n$7.1\\sigma$. Our proposed approach for choosing apertures has been proven to be\ndecisive for the determination of a mask model capable to provide near maximum\nplanet yield and substantially reduced occurrence of false positives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 15:50:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

The result is surprising given that there is little change in\nthe protein surface, and thus the solvent dynamics held responsible for the\ntransition should not change. A spectral analysis of the measurements guided by\nquasiharmonic calculations of the protein absorbance reveals that indeed the\nsolvent dynamical turn-on temperature is independent of the thermal stability\nand photostate however the protein dynamical turn-on temperature shifts to\nhigher temperatures. This is the first demonstration of switching the protein\ndynamical turn-on temperature with protein functional state. The observed shift\nin protein dynamical turn-on temperature relative to the solvent indicates an\nincrease in the required mobile waters necessary for the protein picosecond\nmotions: that is these motions are more collective. Melting-point measurements\nreveal that the photobleached state is more thermally stable and structural\nanalysis of related RFPs shows that there is an increase in internal water\nchannels as well as a more uniform atomic root mean squared displacement. These\nobservations are consistent with previous suggestions that water channels form\nwith extended light excitation providing O2 access to the chromophore and\nsubsequent fluorescence loss. We report that these same channels increase\ninternal coupling enhancing thermal stability and collectivity of the\npicosecond protein motions.

Our numerical scheme is developed\nstarting from the work presented in [TD14], in which the spatial domain is\ndiscretized using a face-based staggered unstructured mesh. For the computation\nof the advection and diffusion terms, two different algorithms are presented:\ni) a purely Eulerian explicit upwind-type scheme and ii) a semi-Lagrangian\napproach. The first methodology leads to a conservative scheme whose major\ndrawback is the time step restriction imposed by the CFL stability condition.\nOn the contrary, computational efficiency can be notably improved relying on a\nsemi-Lagrangian approach. This method leads to an unconditionally stable scheme\nif the diffusive terms are discretized implicitly. Once the advection and\ndiffusion contributions have been computed, the pressure Poisson equation is\nsolved and the velocity is updated. As a second model for the computation of\nbuoyancy-driven flows, we also consider the full compressible Navier-Stokes\nequations.

The validity and\nthe robustness of our novel class of staggered semi-implicit DG schemes is\nassessed at the aid of several classical benchmark problems, showing in all\ncases a good agreement with available numerical reference data.

Owing to a recent observation in Raman\nspectroscopy, of a precursor in the charge channel, on top of the well known\nfact of a precursor in the superconducting channel, we present here a novel\nidea: the PG is formed through a Higgs mechanism, where two kinds of preformed\npairs, in the particle-particle and particle-hole channels, become entangled\nthrough a freezing of their global phase. Remarkably, this entanglement is\nequivalent to fractionalizing a Cooper pair density wave (PDW) into its\nelementary parts; the particle-hole pair, giving rise to both density\nmodulations and current modulations, and the particle-particle counterpart,\nleading to the formation of Cooper pairs. From this perspective, the\n\"fractionalized PDW\" becomes the central object around the formation of the\npseudo-gap. The \"locking\" of phases between the charge and superconducting\nmodes gives a unique explanation for the unusual global phase coherence of\nshort-range charge modulations, observed below $T_{c}$ on phase sensitive\nscanning tunneling microscopy (STM). A simple microscopic model enables us to\nestimate the mean-field values of the precursor gaps in each channel and the PG\nenergy scale, and to compare them to the values observed in Raman scattering\nspectroscopy.

Our analysis allows a decision-maker to interpret\nthe size of the ambiguity set, which is often lack of business meaning, through\nthe chance parameters constraining the objective function. We first show that,\nfor general $\\phi$-divergences, a DRO problem is asymptotically equivalent to a\nclass of mean-deviation problems. These mean-deviation problems are not subject\nto uncertain distributions, and the ambiguity radius in the original DRO\nproblem now plays the role of controlling the risk preference of the\ndecision-maker. We then demonstrate that a DRO problem can be cast as a\nchance-constrained optimization (CCO) problem when a boundedness constraint is\nadded to the decision variables. Without the boundedness constraint, the CCO\nproblem is shown to perform uniformly better than the DRO problem, irrespective\nof the radius of the ambiguity set, the choice of the divergence measure, or\nthe tail heaviness of the center distribution.

A common approach for addressing dimensionality issues relies on\nthe use of static graphical structures for extracting the most significant\ndependence interrelationships between the variables of interest. Recently,\nBayesian nonparametric techniques have become popular for modelling complex\nphenomena in a flexible and efficient manner, but only few attempts have been\nmade in econometrics. In this paper, we provide an innovative Bayesian\nnonparametric (BNP) time-varying graphical framework for making inference in\nhigh-dimensional time series. We include a Bayesian nonparametric dependent\nprior specification on the matrix of coefficients and the covariance matrix by\nmean of a Time-Series DPP as in Nieto-Barajas et al. (2012). Following Billio\net al. (2019), our hierarchical prior overcomes over-parametrization and\nover-fitting issues by clustering the vector autoregressive (VAR) coefficients\ninto groups and by shrinking the coefficients of each group toward a common\nlocation. Our BNP timevarying VAR model is based on a spike-and-slab\nconstruction coupled with dependent Dirichlet Process prior (DPP) and allows\nto: (i) infer time-varying Granger causality networks from time series; (ii)\nflexibly model and cluster non-zero time-varying coefficients; (iii)\naccommodate for potential non-linearities.

In particular, our\nfocus is on the interplay between different notions of fairness, stability, and\nbifurcation theoretic properties. Different notions of fairness give rise to\ndifferent non-linear models for the class of Dual algorithms. One can devise\nconditions for local stability, for each of these models, but such conditions\ndo not offer clear design recommendations on which fairness criteria is\ndesirable. With a bifurcation-theoretic analysis, we have to take non-linear\nterms into consideration, which helps to learn additional dynamical properties\nof the various systems. In the case of TCP fair and Delay dual algorithms, with\ntwo delays, we present evidence that they can undergo a sub-critical Hopf\nbifurcation, which has not been previously revealed through analysis of the\nsingle delay variants of these algorithms. A sub-critical Hopf bifurcation can\nresult in either large amplitude limit cycles or unstable limit cycles, and\nhence should be avoided in engineering applications. In the case of the\nProportionally fair algorithm, we provide strong evidence to suggest that all\none should expect is the occurrence of a super-critical Hopf bifurcation, which\nleads to stable limit cycles with small amplitude. Thus, from a design\nperspective, our analysis favors the use of Proportional fairness in the class\nof dual congestion control algorithms. To best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst study that presents evidence to suggest that fluid models representing\nInternet congestion control algorithms may undergo a sub-critical Hopf\nbifurcation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2019 16:33:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

We\npropose a new method, called the age-period-cohort-interaction (APC-I) model,\nthat is qualitatively different from previous methods in that it represents\nRyder's (1965) theoretical account about the conditions under which cohort\ndifferentiation may arise.

It has many dimensions which differ from users' point of\nview that depend on their requirements. Therefore, those dimensions lead to\ndifficulty in measuring and defining the software quality properly. Software\nquality measurement is the main core of the software quality. Thus, it is\nnecessary to study and develop the software measurements to meet the better\nquality. The use of libraries increases software quality more than that of\nusing generic programming because these libraries are prepared and tested in\nadvance. In addition, these libraries reduce the effort that is spent in\ndesigning, testing, and maintenance processes. In this research, we presented a\nnew model to calculate the saved effort that results from using libraries\ninstead of generic programming in the coding, testing, and productivity\nprocesses. The proposed model consists of three metrics that are Library\nInvestment Ratio, Library Investment Level, and Program Simplicity. An\nempirical analyzes has been applied into ten projects to compare the results of\nthe model with Reuse Percent.

A resilient community is one that has prepared for, and\ncan thus absorb, recover from, and adapt to the disruptive event. One important\naspect of the recovery phase is assessing the extent of the damage in the built\nenvironment through post-event building inspections. In this paper, we develop\nand demonstrate a resilience-based methodology intended to support rapid\npost-event decision-making about inspection priorities with limited\ninformation. The method uses the basic characteristics of the building stock in\na community (floor area, number of stories, type of construction and\nconfiguration) to assign structure-specific fragility functions to each\nbuilding. For an event with a given seismic intensity, the probability of each\nbuilding reaching a particular damage state is determined, and is used to\npredict the actual building states and priorities for inspection. Losses are\ncomputed based on building usage category, estimated inspection costs, the\nconsequences of erroneous decisions, and the potential for unnecessary\nrestrictions in access. The aim is to provide a means for a community to make\nrapid cost-based decisions related to inspection of their building inventory.\nWe pose the decision problem as an integer optimization problem that attempts\nto minimize the expected loss to the community. The advantages of this approach\nare that it: (i) is simple, (ii) requires minimal inventory data, (iii) is\neasily scalable, and (iv) does not require significant computing power. Use of\nthis approach before the hazard event can also provide a community with the\nmeans to plan and allocate resources in advance of an event to achieve the\ndesirable resiliency goals of the community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 2019 15:12:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Jul 2019 20:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}
