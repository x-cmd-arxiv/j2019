Common techniques\neither directly assess the movement of the chest due to breathing or are based\non analyzing subtle color changes that occur as a result of hemodynamic\nproperties of the skin tissue by means of remote photoplethysmography (rPPG).\nHowever, extracting hemodynamic parameters from rPPG is often difficult\nespecially if the skin is not visible to the camera. In contrast, extracting\nrespiratory signals from chest movements turned out to be a robust method.\nHowever, the detectability of chest regions cannot be guaranteed in any\napplication scenario, for instance if the camera setting is optimized to\nprovide close-up images of the head. In such a case an alternative method for\nrespiration detection is required.\n  It is reasonable to assume that the mechanical coupling between chest and\nhead induces minor movements of the head which, like in rPPG, can be detected\nfrom subtle color changes as well. Although the strength of these movements is\nexpected to be much smaller in scale, sensing these intensity variations could\nprovide a reasonably suited respiration signal for subsequent respiratory rate\nanalysis.\n  In order to investigate this coupling we conducted an experimental study with\n12 subjects and applied motion- and rPPG-based methods to estimate the\nrespiratory frequency from both head regions and chest. Our results show that\nit is possible to derive signals correlated to chest movement from facial\nregions. The method is a feasible alternative to rPPG-based respiratory rate\nestimations when rPPG-signals cannot be derived reliably and chest movement\ndetection cannot be applied as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 16:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-20"}

Methods: The proposed Cartesian MRF method involved the acquisition\nof highly subsampled MR images using a 16-shot EPI readout. A linearly varying\nflip angle train was used for rapid, simultaneous T1 and T2 quantification. The\naccuracy of parametric map estimations were improved by using an iterative\nprojection algorithm. The results were compared to a conventional spiral MRF\nimplementation. The acquisition time per slice was 8s and this method was\nvalidated on a phantom and a healthy volunteer brain in vivo. Results: Joint T1\nand T2 estimations using the 16-shot EPI readout are in good agreement with the\nspiral implementation using the same acquisition parameters (deviation less\nthan 3% for T1 and less than 4% for T2) for the healthy volunteer brain. The T1\nand T2 values also agree with the conventional values previously reported in\nthe literature.

Existing detection methods can not effectively detect early attacks.\nIn this paper, we propose a detection method of DDoS attacks based on\ngeneralized multiple kernel learning (GMKL) combining with the constructed\nparameter R. The super-fusion feature value (SFV) and comprehensive degree of\nfeature (CDF) are defined to describe the characteristic of attack flow and\nnormal flow. A method for calculating R based on SFV and CDF is proposed to\nselect the combination of kernel function and regularization paradigm. A DDoS\nattack detection classifier is generated by using the trained GMKL model with R\nparameter. The experimental results show that kernel function and\nregularization parameter selection method based on R parameter reduce the\nrandomness of parameter selection and the error of model detection, and the\nproposed method can effectively detect DDoS attacks in complex environments\nwith higher detection rate and lower error rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 16:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-20"}

Eclipsing binaries with low-mass components are hard to\nfind due to their low luminosity. As a consequence, the analysis of the known\nlow-mass eclipsing systems is key to understand this behavior. We developed a\nphysical model of the LMDEB system NSVS 10653195 to accurately measure the\nmasses and radii of the components. We obtained several high-resolution spectra\nin order to fit a spectroscopic orbit. Standardized absolute photometry was\nobtained to measure reliable color indices and to measure the mean Teff of the\nsystem in out-of-eclipse phases. We observed and analyzed optical VRI and\ninfrared JK band differential light-curves which were fitted using PHOEBE. A\nMarkov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation near the solution found provides\nrobust uncertainties for the fitted parameters. NSVS 10653195 is a detached\neclipsing binary composed of two similar stars with masses of\nM1=0.6402+/-0.0052 Msun and M2=0.6511+/-0.0052 Msun and radii of\nR1=0.687^{+0.017}_{-0.024} Rsun and R2=0.672^{+0.018}_{-0.022} Rsun.

The distance to the system is estimated to be\nd=135.2^{+7.6}_{-7.9} pc, in excellent agreement with the value from Gaia. If\nsolar metallicity were assumed, the age of the system would be older than\nlog(age)~8 based on the Mbol-log Teff diagram. NSVS 10653195 is composed of two\noversized and active K stars.

Here, we propose a way to learn an approximate transport map\nand a parametric approximation of the Wasserstein barycenter.

The observations\nresulted in the first detection of 4765 MHz OH in a late-type stellar object.\nThe line was narrow (FWHM ~ 0.6 km/s) and ~40 km/s blueshifted with respect to\nthe systemic velocity, which suggests association with the expanding\njets/bullets in CRL 618. We also report non-detection at Arecibo of any other\nOH transition between 1 and 9 GHz. The non-detections were obtained during the\nobservations in 2008, when the 4765 MHz OH line was first discovered, and also\nin 2015 when the 4765 MHz OH line was not detected.

Modeling of the 4765 MHz OH detection\nand non-detection of the other transitions is consistent with the physical\nconditions expected in CRL 618.

However, they have not been\nanalytically related yet. In this work we show that Divisive Normalization can\nbe obtained from the Wilson-Cowan model. Specifically, assuming that Divisive\nNormalization is the steady state solution of the Wilson-Cowan differential\nequation, we find that the kernel that controls neural interactions in Divisive\nNormalization depends on the Wilson-Cowan kernel but also has a\nsignal-dependent contribution. A standard stability analysis of a Wilson-Cowan\nmodel with the parameters obtained from our relation shows that the Divisive\nNormalization solution is a stable node. This stability demonstrates the\nconsistency of our steady state assumption.\n  The proposed theory provides a physiological foundation (a relation to a\ndynamical network with fixed wiring among neurons) for the functional\nsuggestions that have been done on the need of signal-dependent Divisive\nNormalization [e.g. in Coen-Cagli et al., PLoS Comp.Biol. 2012]. Moreover, this\ntheory explains the modifications that had to be introduced ad-hoc in Gaussian\nkernels of Divisive Normalization in [Martinez et al. Front.

The proposed relation implies that the\nWilson-Cowan dynamics also reproduces visual masking and subjective image\ndistortion metrics, which up to now had been mainly explained via Divisive\nNormalization.

We give an explicit\nexample of an orientifold $X$ of a hypersurface in a toric variety, and a\nhyperplane $\\mathcal{H} \\subset H_4(X,\\mathbb{Z})$, such that for any $[\\Sigma]\n\\in H$ that satisfies the WGC, the minimal volume obeys\n$\\mathrm{Vol}(\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{min}}) \\ll \\mathrm{Vol}(\\Sigma_{\\cup})$: the\nholomorphic and antiholomorphic components recombine to form a much smaller\ncycle. In particular, the sub-Lattice WGC applied to $X$ implies large\nrecombination, no matter how sparse the sublattice. Non-BPS instantons wrapping\n$\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{min}}$ are then more important than would be predicted from a\nstudy of BPS instantons wrapping the separate components of $\\Sigma_{\\cup}$.\nOur analysis hinges on a novel computation of effective divisors in $X$ that\nare not inherited from effective divisors of the toric variety.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

This\nemission probes of the innermost region of the accretion disc through general\nrelativistic distortions to the line profile.

We find that the mini-halos form objects\nresembling dwarf galaxies. Despite our high resolution, none of our\n'mini-halos' form objects that might be considered globular cluster-like.\nInstead such objects are formed in the host galaxy's gaseous disk. We\ninvestigate why some form stars more efficiently than others. We find that the\nmajority of their star forming gas is accreted after reionisation, thus the\nsurvival of a mini-halo's gas to reionisation is not an important factor.\nInstead, the key factor seems to be the ability for a mini-halo to cool its\nrecently accreted gas, which is more efficient in more massive halos. We find\nhalos in denser environments suffer more mergers, enabling them to grow their\nmass such that cooling of accreted gas can occur efficiently. Although the host\ngalaxy is only a dwarf galaxy itself, we find that ram pressure is an efficient\nmeans by which accreted mini-halos lose their gas content, both by interacting\nwith hot halo gas but also in direct collisions with the gas disk of the host.\nThe satellites are also disrupted by the tidal forces near the center of the\nhost galaxy. Compared to the disrupted satellites, surviving satellites are\nrelatively more massive, but tend to infall later into the host galaxy, thus\nreducing the time they are subjected to destructive environmental mechanisms\nand dynamical friction. In summary, our results suggest that the\ncharacteristics of satellites are mainly determined by their ability to\nefficiently cool gas that is accreted in the redshift range z=3-5, prior to\ntheir infall into the host galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

For weakly-damped systems the Lindblad-form Markovian\nmaster equation is invaluable for this task due to its tractability and\nefficiency. This equation only applies, however, when the frequencies of any\nsubset of the system's transitions are either equal (degenerate), or their\ndifferences are much greater than the transitions' linewidths (far-detuned).\nOutside of these two regimes the only available efficient description has been\nthe Bloch-Redfield (B-R) master equation, the efficacy of which has long been\ncontroversial due to its failure to guarantee the positivity of the density\nmatrix. The ability to efficiently simulate weakly-damped systems across all\nregimes is becoming increasingly important, especially in the area of quantum\ntechnologies. Here we solve this long-standing problem. We discover that a\ncondition on the slope of the spectral density is sufficient to derive a\nLindblad form master equation that is accurate for all regimes. We further show\nthat this condition is necessary for weakly-damped systems to be described by\nthe B-R equation or indeed any Markovian master equation. We thus obtain a\nreplacement for the B-R equation over its entire domain of applicability that\nis no less accurate, simpler in structure, completely positive, allows\nsimulation by efficient quantum trajectory methods, and unifies the previous\nLindblad master equations. We also show via exact simulations that the new\nmaster equation can describe systems in which slowly-varying transition\nfrequencies cross each other during the evolution. System identification tools,\ndeveloped in systems engineering, play an important role in our analysis. We\nexpect these tools to prove useful in other areas of physics involving complex\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:01:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 02:21:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

It is shown that the sign of the response of the Hamiltonian\nis correlated with the T-parity of the operator. We can then choose the sign of\nthe amplitude of the quench to result in a reduction in the energy. This\nimplies a reduction of the entanglement entropy between both sides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:25:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

Disks are generally well represented by a fluid-like\ndense medium, whose evolution can be calculated by a hydrocode. On the other\nhand, the orbital evolution of satellites is generally performed using N-body\nintegrators. We have developed a new numerical model that combines a\n1-dimensional hydrocode with the N-body integrator SyMBA. The disk evolves due\nto its viscosity, and resonant torques from satellites. The latter is applied\nto the satellites as an additional \"kick\" to their accelerations. The\nintegrator also includes the ability to spawn new moonlets at the disk's outer\nedge if the latter expands beyond a material-dependent Roche limit, as well as\nthe effects of tidal dissipation in the planet and/or the satellite on the\nsatellite orbits. The resulting integrator allows one to accurately model the\nevolution of an inner circumplanetary disk, and the formation of satellites by\naccumulation of disk material, all within a single self-consistent framework.\nPotential applications include the formation of Earth's Moon, the evolution of\nthe inner Saturn system, the martian and uranian moons, and compact\nexoplanetary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

The recent study on\nthe non-Gaussian diffusion in a static disordered landscape suggests novel\nphenomena due to the quenched disorder. In this work, we further investigate\nthe random walk in this landscape under various effective temperature $\\mu$,\nwhich continuously modulates the dynamic heterogeneity. We show in the long\ntime limit, the trap dynamics on the landscape is equivalent to the quenched\ntrap model, in which sub-diffusion appears for $\\mu<1$. The non-Gaussian\ndistribution of displacement has been analytically estimated for short $t$, of\nwhich the stretched exponential tail is expected for $\\mu\\neq1$. Due to the\nlocalization in the ensemble of trajectory segments, an additional peak arises\nin $P(x,t)$ around $x=0$ even for $\\mu>1$. Evolving in different time scales,\nthe peak and the tail of $P(x,t)$ are well split for a wide range of $t$. This\ntheoretical study reveals the connections among the sub-diffusion, non-Gaussian\ndiffusion, and the dynamic heterogeneity in the static disordered medium. It\nalso offers an insight on how the cell would benefit from the quasi-static\ndisordered structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:33:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 04:35:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

This study uses the weather research forecast (WRF) model to\nperform a series of simulations for tropical cyclone Enawo with the aim of\ninvestigating the effect of an increase or decrease (by 2$^{\\circ}C$) in sea\nsurface temperature (SST) on the intensity of the tropical cyclone (using\nwindspeed, precipitation and pressure as measures of cyclone intensity). The\nexperiment uses the data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather\nForecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 re-analysis dataset to validate the results of the WRF\nmodel which was ran using boundary conditions data from climate forecast system\nreanalysis (CFSR).\n  The results indicate that the WRF model performs reasonably well in\nsimulating the track and windspeed of the tropical cyclone, when compared to\nobservational data. In simulating the tropical cyclone, the WRF model shows\nthat an increase in the SST by 2$^{\\circ}C$ generally increases the intensity\nof the tropical cyclone formed. This is evident in the increasing maximum\nprecipitation rate as well as windspeed, and decreasing minimum pressure. An\nincrease in SST also causes the emergence of a second low pressure system. On\nthe other hand, a decrease in the SST by 2$^{\\circ}C$ leads to a minute effect\nin the intensity but generally acts to decrease it. This results in a smoother\ntrack path for the tropical cyclone, a decrease in the maximum precipitation\nrate and windspeed, and an increase in the surface pressure.\n  The results of this study have shown that increasing the global temperature\nby around 2$^{\\circ}C$ - violation of the Paris Accord - would lead to more\nviolent and unpredictable tropical cyclones within the SWIO, and hence more\ndestruction and loss of lives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-21"}

Traditionally, researchers\nmanually craft deep neural networks to meet the needs of mobile devices. Neural\nArchitecture Search (NAS) was proposed to automate the neural architecture\ndesign without requiring extensive domain expertise and significant manual\nefforts. Recent works utilized NAS to design mobile models by taking into\naccount hardware constraints and achieved state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer\nparameters and less computational cost measured in Multiply-accumulates (MACs).\nTo find highly compact neural architectures, existing works relies on\npredefined cells and directly applying width multiplier, which may potentially\nlimit the model flexibility, reduce the useful feature map information, and\ncause accuracy drop. To conquer this issue, we propose GRAM(GRAph propagation\nas Meta-knowledge) that adopts fine-grained (node-wise) search method and\naccumulates the knowledge learned in updates into a meta-graph. As a result,\nGRAM can enable more flexible search space and achieve higher search\nefficiency.

The\nquasi-simultaneous multi-wavelength coverage allowed us to construct\ntime-resolved spectral energy distributions (SEDs). PKS 0346-27 entered an\nelevated $\\gamma$-ray activity state starting from the beginning of 2018. The\nhigh-state continued throughout the year, displaying the highest fluxes in May\n2018. We find evidence of short-time scale variability down to $\\sim$1.5 hours,\nwhich constrains the $\\gamma$-ray emission region to be compact. The extended\nflaring period was characterized by a persistently harder spectrum with respect\nto the quiescent state, indicating changes in the broadband spectral properties\nof the source. This was confirmed by the multi-wavelength observations, which\nshow a shift in the position of the two SED peaks by $\\sim$2 orders of\nmagnitude in energy and peak flux value. As a result, during the high state the\nnon-thermal jet emission completely outshines the thermal contribution from the\ndust torus and accretion disk. The broadband SED of PKS 0346-27 transitions\nfrom a typical Low-Synchrotron-Peaked (LSP) to the\nIntermediate-Synchrotron-Peaked (ISP) class, a behavior previously observed in\nother flaring $\\gamma$-ray sources. Our one-zone leptonic emission model of the\nhigh-state SEDs constrains the $\\gamma$-ray emission region to have a lower\nmagnetic field, larger radius, and higher maximum electron Lorentz factors with\nrespect to the quiescent SED. Finally, we note that the bright and hard\n$\\gamma$-ray spectrum observed during the peak of flaring activity in May 2018\nimplies that PKS 0346-27 could be a promising target for future ground-based\nCherenkov observatories such as the CTA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 19:16:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

The idea is to compute a global weight update without revealing the\ncontributions of individual users. Current practical protocols for secure\naggregation work in an \"honest but curious\" setting where a curious adversary\nobserving all communication to and from the server cannot learn any private\ninformation assuming the server is honest and follows the protocol. A more\nscalable and robust primitive for privacy-preserving protocols is shuffling of\nuser data, so as to hide the origin of each data item. Highly scalable and\nsecure protocols for shuffling, so-called mixnets, have been proposed as a\nprimitive for privacy-preserving analytics in the Encode-Shuffle-Analyze\nframework by Bittau et al., which was later analytically studied by Erlingsson\net al. and Cheu et al..

We define three factors that\nallow us to quantify the effectiveness of each power allocation scheme in\nachieving an MSE-power tradeoff that is close to that of the Bayesian CRB.\nCombining the information gained from the factors and Bayesian CRB with our\ncomputational complexity analysis provides the system designer with\nquantitative complexity-versus-MSE improvement tradeoffs offered by different\npower allocation schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 20:03:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 16:43:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 00:52:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 02:24:48 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 23:41:36 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 05:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-01"}

However, it is not\ntrivial to use CNN-based methods for saliency detection on light field images\nbecause these methods are not specifically designed for processing light field\ninputs. In addition, current light field datasets are not sufficiently large to\ntrain CNNs. To overcome these issues, we present a new Lytro Illum dataset,\nwhich contains 640 light fields and their corresponding ground-truth saliency\nmaps. Compared to current light field saliency datasets [1], [2], our new\ndataset is larger, of higher quality, contains more variation and more types of\nlight field inputs.

Next-generation\ntelescopes such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the Square Kilometer\nArray are planned to become operational in this decade and the next, and will\nincrease the data volume by many orders of magnitude. The increased spatial,\ntemporal and spectral resolution afford a powerful magnifying lens on the\nphysical processes that underlie the data but, at the same time, generate\nunprecedented complexity hard to exploit for knowledge extraction. It is\ntherefore imperative to develop machine intelligence, machine learning (ML) in\nparticular, suitable for processing the amount and variety of astronomical data\nthat will be collected, and capable of answering scientific questions based on\nthe data. Astronomical data exhibit the usual challenges associated with 'big\ndata' such as immense volumes, high dimensionality, missing or highly distorted\nobservations. In addition, astronomical data can exhibit large continuous\nobservational gaps, very low signal-to-noise ratio and the need to distinguish\nbetween true missing data and non-detections due to upper limits). There are\nstrict laws of physics behind the data production which can be assimilated into\nML mechanisms to improve over general off-the-shelf state-of-the-art methods.\nSignificant progress in the face of these challenges can be achieved only via\nthe new discipline of Astroinformatics: a symbiosis of diverse disciplines,\nsuch as ML, probabilistic modeling, astronomy and astrophysics, statistics,\ndistributed computing and natural computation.

In the case when cross-language interoperability is\naccomplished with a Foreign Function Interface (FFI), for example pybind11,\nBoost.Python, Emscripten, PyV8, or JNI, among many others, common software\nengineering tools, such as call-graph analysis, are obstructed by the opacity\nof the FFI. This complicates debugging and fosters potential inefficiency and\nsecurity problems. One contributing issue is that there is little rigorous\nsoftware design advice for multilingual software. In this paper, we present our\nprogress towards a more rigorous design approach to multilingual software. The\napproach is based on the existing approach to the design of large-scale C++\nsystems developed by Lakos. The Lakosian approach is one of the few design\nmethodologies to address physical design rather than just logical design. Using\nthe MLSA toolkit developed in prior work for analysis of multilingual software,\nwe focus in on one FFI -- the pybind11 FFI. An extension to the Lakosian C++\ndesign rules is proposed to address multilingual software that uses pybind11.\nUsing a sample of 50 public GitHub repositories that use pybind11, we measure\nhow many repositories would currently satisfy these rules. We conclude with a\nproposed generalization of the pybind11-based rules for any multilingual\nsoftware using an FFI interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 20:55:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-21"}

The valence-band offset $\\Delta E_v$ between MgO and\nZnO, ZnO and MgO/ZnO, and ZnO and MgO/ZnO/MgO heterointerfaces are determined\nto be 0.37 $\\pm$0.02, -0.05$\\pm$0.02, and -0.11$\\pm$0.02 eV, respectively; the\nconduction-band offset $\\Delta E_c$ is deduced to be 0.97$\\pm$0.02,\n0.46$\\pm$0.02, and 0.59$\\pm$0.02 eV indicating straddling type-I in MgO and\nZnO, and staggering type-II heterojunction band alignment in ZnO and the\nvarious heterostructures. The band-offsets and interfacial charge transfer are\nused to explain the origin of $n$-type conductivity in the superlattices.\nEnhanced optical absorption due to carrier confinement in the layers\ndemonstrates that MgO is an excellent high-$\\kappa$ dielectric gate oxide for\nencapsulating ZnO-based optoelectronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 20:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-21"}

However,\nstudies have shown that societal biases present in text corpora may be\nincorporated into the word embedding spaces learned from them. Thus, there is\nan ethical concern that human-like biases contained in the corpora and their\nderived embedding spaces might be propagated, or even amplified with the usage\nof the biased embedding spaces in downstream applications. In an attempt to\nquantify these biases so that they may be better understood and studied,\nseveral bias metrics have been proposed. We explore the statistical properties\nof these proposed measures in the context of their cited applications as well\nas their supposed utilities. We find that there are caveats to the simple\ninterpretation of these metrics as proposed. We find that the bias metric\nproposed by Bolukbasi et al. 2016 is highly sensitive to embedding\nhyper-parameter selection, and that in many cases, the variance due to the\nselection of some hyper-parameters is greater than the variance in the metric\ndue to corpus selection, while in fewer cases the bias rankings of corpora vary\nwith hyper-parameter selection. In light of these observations, it may be the\ncase that bias estimates should not be thought to directly measure the\nproperties of the underlying corpus, but rather the properties of the specific\nembedding spaces in question, particularly in the context of hyper-parameter\nselections used to generate them. Hence, bias metrics of spaces generated with\ndiffering hyper-parameters should be compared only with explicit consideration\nof the embedding-learning algorithms particular configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 21:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-21"}

In this work, we\nclose the gap by viewing PG methods from a nonconvex optimization perspective.\nIn particular, we propose a new variant of PG methods for infinite-horizon\nproblems that uses a random rollout horizon for the Monte-Carlo estimation of\nthe policy gradient. This method then yields an unbiased estimate of the policy\ngradient with bounded variance, which enables the tools from nonconvex\noptimization to be applied to establish global convergence. Employing this\nperspective, we first recover the convergence results with rates to the\nstationary-point policies in the literature. More interestingly, motivated by\nadvances in nonconvex optimization, we modify the proposed PG method by\nintroducing periodically enlarged stepsizes. The modified algorithm is shown to\nescape saddle points under mild assumptions on the reward and the policy\nparameterization. Under a further strict saddle points assumption, this result\nestablishes convergence to essentially locally-optimal policies of the\nunderlying problem, and thus bridges the gap in existing literature on the\nconvergence of PG methods. Results from experiments on the inverted pendulum\nare then provided to corroborate our theory, namely, by slightly reshaping the\nreward function to satisfy our assumption, unfavorable saddle points can be\navoided and better limit points can be attained. Intriguingly, this empirical\nfinding justifies the benefit of reward-reshaping from a nonconvex optimization\nperspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 22:33:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 12:39:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2020 21:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

However, the exact tradeoff between fairness and accuracy is not\nentirely clear, even for the basic paradigm of classification problems. In this\npaper, we characterize an inherent tradeoff between statistical parity and\naccuracy in the classification setting by providing a lower bound on the sum of\ngroup-wise errors of any fair classifiers. Our impossibility theorem could be\ninterpreted as a certain uncertainty principle in fairness: if the base rates\ndiffer among groups, then any fair classifier satisfying statistical parity has\nto incur a large error on at least one of the groups. We further extend this\nresult to give a lower bound on the joint error of any (approximately) fair\nclassifiers, from the perspective of learning fair representations. To show\nthat our lower bound is tight, assuming oracle access to Bayes (potentially\nunfair) classifiers, we also construct an algorithm that returns a randomized\nclassifier that is both optimal (in terms of accuracy) and fair. Interestingly,\nwhen the protected attribute can take more than two values, an extension of\nthis lower bound does not admit an analytic solution. Nevertheless, in this\ncase, we show that the lower bound can be efficiently computed by solving a\nlinear program, which we term as the TV-Barycenter problem, a barycenter\nproblem under the TV-distance. On the upside, we prove that if the group-wise\nBayes optimal classifiers are close, then learning fair representations leads\nto an alternative notion of fairness, known as the accuracy parity, which\nstates that the error rates are close between groups.

The main question of interest is to determine the\nminimum number of measurements that is necessary and sufficient for the perfect\nrecovery of the unknown signal with high probability.

(Science 364, 170-173)\ntheoretically predicted and experimentally demonstrated a stationary\ntemperature profile in a diffusive heat transfer system - seemingly indicating\nthat heat \"stops\" diffusing. By analogy to the wave physics framework, the\nmotionless and moving temperature profiles are manifestations of the\nanti-parity-time APT symmetry and symmetry breaking states, respectively. Their\nexperimental setup consists of two thermally coupled rings rotating in the\nopposite direction. At a particular rotation speed, known as the exceptional\npoint, the APT symmetry of the system changes, resulting in the temperature\nprofile switching between stationary and moving states. In fact, this seemingly\nunusual and exotic behavior can be elegantly captured and predicted using a\nconventional heat transfer framework with similarity and scaling analysis. In\nthis work, we show the system behavior can be characterized into three zones by\ntwo widely-used dimensionless parameters on a regime map.

Furthermore, the observed cessation of thermal\ndiffusion is merely a result of the long diffusion time constant of the\nexperimental setup. The unfamiliarity of concepts in another scientific field\nas well as the remarkable equivalence of the two points of view prompts this\nin-depth discussion of the analogy between wave physics and heat transfer.

Subsequent\nwork has focused on either extending this setting to when each data point has\nmultiple, non-disjoint sensitive types such as race and gender [6], or to\naddress the problem that the clustering algorithms in the above work do not\nscale well. The main contribution of this paper is an approach to clustering\nwith fairness constraints that involve multiple, non-disjoint types, that is\nalso scalable. Our approach is based on novel constructions of coresets: for\nthe $k$-median objective, we construct an $\\varepsilon$-coreset of size\n$O(\\Gamma k^2 \\varepsilon^{-d})$ where $\\Gamma$ is the number of distinct\ncollections of groups that a point may belong to, and for the $k$-means\nobjective, we show how to construct an $\\varepsilon$-coreset of size $O(\\Gamma\nk^3\\varepsilon^{-d-1})$. The former result is the first known coreset\nconstruction for the fair clustering problem with the $k$-median objective, and\nthe latter result removes the dependence on the size of the full dataset as in\n[39] and generalizes it to multiple, non-disjoint types. Plugging our coresets\ninto existing algorithms for fair clustering such as [5] results in the fastest\nalgorithms for several cases. Empirically, we assess our approach over the\n\\textbf{Adult}, \\textbf{Bank}, \\textbf{Diabetes} and \\textbf{Athlete} dataset,\nand show that the coreset sizes are much smaller than the full dataset.

A clear physical understanding of the driving factors of the\nunsteadiness is still lacking. Under the current conditions, the nozzle\noperates in a highly-overexpanded regime and comprises a conical separation\nshock within the nozzle contour, merging into a Mach disk in the nozzle centre.\nOur current study focuses on the unsteady pressure signature on the nozzle\nwall, through the use of Fourier-based spectral analysis performed in time and\nin the azimuthal wavenumber space. The numerical data well agrees with the\nexperimental measurements in terms of mean and fluctuating wall pressure\nstatistics. The frequency spectra are characterised by the presence of a large\nbump in the low frequency range associated to a breathing motion of the shock\nsystem and a broad and high amplitude peak at high frequencies generated by the\nturbulent activity of the detached shear layer. Moreover, a distinct peak at an\nintermediate frequency (of the order 1000 Hz) is observed to persist in the\nwall-pressure spectra along the nozzle wall. The analysis of the pressure\nsignals in the azimuthal wavenumber space indicates that this peak is clearly\nassociated to the first (non-symmetrical) pressure mode and it is thus\nconnected to the generation of side loads. Furthermore, it is found that the\nunsteady Mach disk is characterised by an intense vortex shedding activity and\nthe interaction of these vortices with the second shock cell is a key factor in\nthe sustainment of an aeroacoustic feedback loop within the nozzle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 08:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

New quantitative results are presented that support\nan explanation in terms of the geometry of the representations spaces used by\nthe verification systems. In the spherical geometry of those spaces, the\nangular distance distributions of matching and non-matching pairs of face\nrepresentations are only modestly separated, approximately centred at 90 and\n40-60 degrees, respectively.

The K and Rb compounds have Weiss\ntemperatures of theta = -66 and -18 K, effective magnetic moments of mu_eff =\n1.44 and 1.45 mu_B/Os, and antiferromagnetic transition temperatures of T_N =\n36.9 and 21.0 K, respectively.

The decline of\nthe Os moment from 1.73 mu_B/Os for the simple d1 spin, particularly for Cs, is\nlikely to originate from the antiparallel orbital moment, although the\nspin-orbit coupling is generally quenched in the low-lying e orbitals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 09:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-21"}

Current\napproaches treat the interaction between these two states of matter either in a\ndecoupled manner or through one-way coupled 'co-simulation'. In this paper a\nmethodology for multiphysics simulations of two-way interaction between\nlightning and elastoplastic materials is presented, which can inherently\ncapture the non-linear feedback between these two states of matter. This is\nachieved by simultaneously solving the magnetohydrodynamic and the\nelastoplastic systems of equations on the same computational mesh, evolving the\nmagnetic and electric fields dynamically. The resulting model allows for the\ntopological evolution and movement of the arc attachment point coupled to the\nstructural response and Joule heating of the substrate. The dynamic\ncommunication between the elastoplastic material and the plasma is facilitated\nby means of Riemann problem-based ghost fluid methods. This two-way coupling,\nto the best of the authors' knowledge, has not been previously demonstrated.\nThe proposed model is first validated against experimental laboratory studies,\ndemonstrating that the growth of the plasma arc can be accurately reproduced,\ndependent on the electrical conductivity of the substrate. It is then\nsubsequently evaluated in a setting where the dynamically-evolved properties\nwithin the substrate feed back into the plasma arc attachment. Results are\npresented for multi-layered substrates of different materials, and for a\nsubstrate with temperature-dependent electrical conductivity. It is\ndemonstrated that these conditions generate distinct behaviour due to the\ninteraction between the plasma arc and the substrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 09:41:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

In this paper, we go beyond previous work and\ninvestigate, inspired by research in visual communication, useful semantic\nimage-text relations for multimodal information retrieval. We derive a\ncategorization of eight semantic image-text classes (e.g., \"illustration\" or\n\"anchorage\") and show how they can systematically be characterized by a set of\nthree metrics: cross-modal mutual information, semantic correlation, and the\nstatus relation of image and text. Furthermore, we present a deep learning\nsystem to predict these classes by utilizing multimodal embeddings. To obtain a\nsufficiently large amount of training data, we have automatically collected and\naugmented data from a variety of data sets and web resources, which enables\nfuture research on this topic. Experimental results on a demanding test set\ndemonstrate the feasibility of the approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 13:20:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-21"}

However, the\nbehavior of the system in the high-activity region is different and more\ninteresting. The system undergoes a series of dynamical phase transitions.

This has motivated the fast development of semi-supervised\ntechniques, whose performance is on a par with or better than supervised\napproaches. A current major challenge for semi-supervised techniques is how to\nbetter handle the network calibration and confirmation bias problems for\nimproving performance. In this work, we argue that energy models are an\neffective alternative to such problems. With this motivation in mind, we\npropose a hybrid framework for semi-supervised classification called CREPE\nmodel (1-Lapla$\\mathbf{C}$ian g$\\mathbf{R}$aph $\\mathbf{E}$nergy for\n$\\mathbf{P}$seudo-lab$\\mathbf{E}$ls). Firstly, we introduce a new energy model\nbased on the non-smooth $\\ell_1$ norm of the normalised graph 1-Laplacian. Our\nfunctional enforces a sufficiently smooth solution and strengthens the\nintrinsic relation between the labelled and unlabelled data. Secondly, we\nprovide a theoretical analysis for our proposed scheme and show that the\nsolution trajectory does converge to a non-constant steady point. Thirdly, we\nderive the connection of our energy model for pseudo-labelling. We show that\nour energy model produces more meaningful pseudo-labels than the ones generated\ndirectly by a deep network. We extensively evaluate our framework, through\nnumerical and visual experiments, using six benchmarking datasets for natural\nand medical images. We demonstrate that our technique reports state-of-the-art\nresults for semi-supervised classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 14:04:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Oct 2019 20:27:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 20:29:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 20:52:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

The linear\nresponse of an axisymmetric stellar disk, to an adiabatic non-axisymmetric\ntransient mode, gives a final distribution function (DF) that is equal to the\ninitial DF everywhere in phase space, except at the Lindblad and corotation\nresonances where the final DF is singular. We use the nonlinear theory of\nadiabatic capture into resonance to resolve the singularities and calculate the\nfinite changes in the DF. These take the form of axisymmetric \"scars\"\nconcentrated around resonances, whose DFs have simple general forms. Global\nchanges in the physical properties are explored for a cool Mestel disk: we\ncalculate the DFs of scars, and estimate the changes in the disk angular\nmomentum, surface density and orbital frequencies leading to shifts of\nresonances. Resonant torques between disk stars and any new linear\nnon-axisymmetric mode are suppressed within a scar, as is epicyclic heating.\nSince all the resonances of a linear mode with the same angular wavenumber and\npattern speed as its precursor lie inside the scars of the precursor, it\nsuffers less damping. Hence, scars filter the spectrum of noise-generated\nmodes, promoting the renewal of a few select modes. Relic scars sustained by a\ngalaxy disk, due to past tidal interaction with a passing companion, may still\nbe active enablers of non-axisymmetric modes, such as the two-armed \"grand\ndesign\" spiral patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 14:18:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 10:24:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

Previous studies showed that VR is a promising\ntool for measuring the impact of height on the postural sway. However, most of\nthese studies used the treadmill as the walking locomotion apparatus in a\nvirtual environment (VE). This paper was focused on natural walking locomotion\nto reduce the inherent postural perturbations of VR devices. To investigate the\nimpact of virtual height on gait characteristics and keep the level of realism\nand feeling of presence at their highest, we enhanced the\nfirst-person-character model with \"virtual legs\". Afterward, we investigated\nits effect on the gait parameters of the participants with and without the\npresence of height. To that end, twelve healthy adults were asked to walk on a\nvirtual loop path once at the ground level and once at the 17th floor of an\nunfinished structure. By quantitatively comparing the participants' gait\npattern results, we observed a decrease in the stride length and increase in\nthe gait duration of the participants exposed to height. At the ground level,\nthe use of the enhanced model reduced participants' average stride length and\nheight. The results of this study help us understand users' behaviors when they\nwere exposed to elevated surfaces and establish a firm ground for gait\nstability analysis for the future height-related VR studies.

Assuming the scalar decays into electrons and muons,\nit can manifest cleaner experimental signatures. In this paper we suggest that\na singly-charged scalar singlet, with electroweak production, can start to be\nprobed in the near future with dedicated search strategies. Depending on the\nstrength of the Yukawa couplings, two independent scenarios are considered:\ndirect pair-production (small couplings) and single-production via virtual\nneutrino exchange (large couplings). We show that, up to a mass as large as 500\nGeV, most of the parameter space could be excluded at the 95% C.L. in a\nhigh-luminosity phase of the LHC.

The structural characterization directs the\nformation of a majority Nb2N phase while the morphology shows granular nature\nof the films. The temperature dependent resistance measurements reveal a wide\nmetal-to-superconductor transition featuring two distinct transition regions.\nThe region close to the normal state varies strongly with the film thickness,\nwhereas, the second region in the vicinity of the superconducting state remains\nalmost unaltered but exhibiting resistive tailing. The current-voltage\ncharacteristics also display wide transition embedded with intermediate\nresistive states originated by phase slip lines. The transition width in\ncurrent and the number of resistive steps depend on film thickness and they\nboth increase with decrease in thickness. The broadening in transition width is\nexplained by progressive establishment of superconductivity through proximity\ncoupled superconducting nano-grains while finite size effects and quantum\nfluctuation may lead to the resistive tailing.

We find that Type-II galaxies have bluer average (g-i) colour in\ntheir outer discs while Type-III galaxies are redder. Br increases with stellar\nmass and molecular gas mass while decreases with molecular gas-fractions. The\ninner and outer scale-lengths increase monotonically with absolute magnitude,\nas found in other works. In Fornax, galaxies with morphological type 5< T< 9\n(~60 % of the sample) are located beyond the high-density, ETG-dominated\nregions, but no correlation found between T and the disc-break type. The main\nresults of this work suggest that the disc-breaks of LTGs inside the virial\nradius of the Fornax cluster seem to have arisen through a variety of\nmechanisms, which is evident in their outer-disc colours and the absence of\nmolecular gas beyond their break radius in some cases. This can result in a\nvariety of stellar populations inside and outside the break radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 15:50:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 11:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

To consider both the item similarity and\nlabel dependency, we propose to leverage the conditional random fields (CRFs)\nin few-shot sequence labeling. It calculates emission score with similarity\nbased methods and obtains transition score with a specially designed transfer\nmechanism. When applying CRF in the few-shot scenarios, the discrepancy of\nlabel sets among different domains makes it hard to use the label dependency\nlearned in prior domains. To tackle this, we introduce the dependency transfer\nmechanism that transfers abstract label transition patterns.

Ensuring a better viewers quality of\nexperience (QoE) is the key to maximize the audiences number and increase\nstreaming providers' profits. This can be achieved by advocating a\ngeo-distributed cloud infrastructure to allocate the multimedia resources as\nclose as possible to viewers, in order to minimize the access delay and video\nstalls. Moreover, allocating the exact needed resources beforehand avoids\nover-provisioning, which may lead to significant costs by the service\nproviders. In the contrary, under-provisioning might cause significant delays\nto the viewers. In this paper, we introduce a prediction driven resource\nallocation framework, to maximize the QoE of viewers and minimize the resource\nallocation cost.

Second, based on the predicted\nresults that showed to be close to the actual values, we formulate an\noptimization problem to proactively allocate resources at the viewers\nproximity.

We consider a response function\nof the thermal QFT on a two-dimensional sphere under a time-periodic localized\nsource.

We find a formula that\nconverts the response function to the image of the dual black hole: The view of\nthe sky of the AdS bulk from a point on the boundary. Using the formula, we\ndemonstrate that, for a thermal state dual to the Schwarzschild-AdS$_4$\nspacetime, the Einstein ring is constructed from the response function.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network with recurrent\nrandom-walk layers for collective EL, which introduces external knowledge to\nmodel the semantic interdependence between different EL decisions.\nSpecifically, we first establish a model based on local context features, and\nthen stack random-walk layers to reinforce the evidence for related EL\ndecisions into high-probability decisions, where the semantic interdependence\nbetween candidate entities is mainly induced from an external knowledge base.\nFinally, a semantic regularizer that preserves the collective EL decisions\nconsistency is incorporated into the conventional objective function, so that\nthe external knowledge base can be fully exploited in collective EL decisions.\nExperimental results and in-depth analysis on various datasets show that our\nmodel achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art models.

The resulting fourth order Orr-Sommerfeld equation is\nreduced to a set of six auxiliary equations which are numerically integrated\nstarting from the rescaled far-field conditions, i.~e., via the Compound Matrix\nMethod. Numerical results indicate that with increasing Weissenberg number: (a)\nthe peak of the maximal growth rate (i. e., the maximum value of the imaginary\ncomponent of the growth rate) is reduced, (b) the entire range of unstable\nspectrum is shifted towards longer waves (i.~e., the entire region of temporal\ninstability is gradually concentrated near zero wavenumber), (c) the vorticity\nstructure contours are dilated and (d) the residual Reynolds stresses are\ndiminished.

The results show that the air-water\ninterface area per unit sea surface area is enhanced dramatically by the\nentrained bubbles: on the order of 10 m^2 at about 15 m/s wind speed.

This development begs the question: is climate change affecting the\nenergy production of solar cells? In this article, we attempt to answer this\nquestion looking backward and forward. We start by analyzing recent trends for\nglobal meteorological conditions and solar cell performance parameters,\ncovering the ten-year period between 20016 and 2015. We leverage a\nfield-verified performance model for two of the most well-established solar\ncell technologies that also feature very different sensitivities to changing\noperating conditions: silicon and cadmium telluride. We find that climate\nchange has already left its mark: ten years ago, silicon solar panels -- on\naverage -- generated 4 kWh per m2 more power than today. Correlating solar cell\nperformance ratio changes and changes in operating conditions, we find that\ntemperature globally is the leading factor for silicon (-0.52 pm 0.03% per K),\naccounting for approx. 85% of the observed effect. Water related light\nabsorption in the atmosphere is most likely responsible for much of the\nremaining contribution. To predict how future solar cell performance is\naffected, we focus on the implications of raising temperatures. For the end of\nthe 21st century, we project that silicon PV panels globally will suffer\nperformance reductions of between 0.7% and 2.5% (8 to 30 kWh per kWp in North\nAmerica), depending on the global warming scenario. These reductions will\nresult in significant socioeconomic penalties, particularly in a world that\nproduces a significant portion of its electricity from PV panels, and\nespecially if additional effects of global warming, like accelerated panel\ndegradation and extreme weather are considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 13:07:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Aug 2019 20:34:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}
