While the problem can be cast in the framework of stochastic dynamic\nprogramming, exact solutions are only tractable for discrete state and action\nspaces of very small dimension due to a series of nested minimization and\nexpectation operations. We propose an approximate dual control method for\nsystems with continuous state and input domain based on a rollout dynamic\nprogramming approach, splitting the control horizon into a dual and an\nexploitation part. The dual part is approximated using a scenario tree\ngenerated by sampling the process noise and the unknown system parameters, for\nwhich the underlying distribution is updated via Bayesian estimation along the\nhorizon. In the exploitation part, we fix the resulting parameter estimate of\neach scenario branch and compute an open-loop control sequence for the\nremainder of the horizon.

In this thesis it is argued that in general there is insufficient\ninformation in a single task for a learner to generalise well and that what is\nrequired for good generalisation is information about many similar learning\ntasks. Similar learning tasks form a body of prior information that can be used\nto constrain the learner and make it generalise better. Examples of learning\nscenarios in which there are many similar tasks are handwritten character\nrecognition and spoken word recognition.\n  The concept of the environment of a learner is introduced as a probability\nmeasure over the set of learning problems the learner might be expected to\nlearn. It is shown how a sample from the environment may be used to learn a\nrepresentation, or recoding of the input space that is appropriate for the\nenvironment. Learning a representation can equivalently be thought of as\nlearning the appropriate features of the environment. Bounds are derived on the\nsample size required to ensure good generalisation from a representation\nlearning process. These bounds show that under certain circumstances learning a\nrepresentation appropriate for $n$ tasks reduces the number of examples\nrequired of each task by a factor of $n$.\n  Once a representation is learnt it can be used to learn novel tasks from the\nsame environment, with the result that far fewer examples are required of the\nnew tasks to ensure good generalisation. Bounds are given on the number of\ntasks and the number of samples from each task required to ensure that a\nrepresentation will be a good one for learning novel tasks.\n  The results on representation learning are generalised to cover any form of\nautomated hypothesis space bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2019 16:25:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 15:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-25"}

With\nrespect to the scaling coefficient and the dark current, several identities in\nterms of derivatives are established.

Hence, determining their location\nis a critical task. This paper proposes a novel image embedding aided deep\nlearning framework called DeVLearn for faulted line location using PMU\nmeasurements at generator buses. Inspired by breakthroughs in computer vision,\nDeVLearn represents measurements (one-dimensional time series data) as\ntwo-dimensional unthresholded Recurrent Plot (RP) images. These RP images\npreserve the temporal relationships present in the original time series and are\nused to train a deep Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). The VAE learns the\ndistribution of latent features in the images. Our results show that for faults\non two different lines in the IEEE 68-bus network, DeVLearn is able to project\nPMU measurements into a two-dimensional space such that data for faults at\ndifferent locations separate into well-defined clusters. This compressed\nrepresentation may then be used with off-the-shelf classifiers for determining\nfault location. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated using\nlocal voltage magnitude measurements at two generator buses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2019 19:18:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

Using a fully unrestricted\nHartree-Fock variational method, we have explained the correlated insulating\nstates and QAH effects at various integer fillings of the flat bands in TBG.\nOur results indicate that states breaking flavor (valley and spin) symmetries\nare energetically favored at all integer fillings. In particular, the\ncorrelated insulating states at $\\pm 1/2$ filling and at the charge neutrality\npoint are all valley polarized sates which break $C_{2z}$ and time-reversal\n($\\mathcal{T}$) symmetries, but preserves $C_{2z}\\mathcal{T}$ symmetry.

We find that the nonlocalness of the\nexchange interactions tend to enhance the bandwidth of the low-energy bands due\nto the exchange-hole effect, which reduces the gaps of the correlated insulator\nphases. The nonlocal exchange interactions also dramatically enhance the spin\npolarization of the system, which significantly stabilize the orbital and spin\nferromagnetic QAH state at $3/4$ filling of TBG aligned with hexagonal boron\nnitride (hBN). We also predict that, by virtue of the orbital ferromagnetic\nnature, the QAH effects at electron and hole fillings of hBN-aligned TBG would\nexhibit hysteresis loops with opposite chiralities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2019 19:36:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 18:50:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 07:55:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2021 09:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

To understand the\nefficiency of cloud formation, it is therefore crucial to quantify the\nreplenishment mechanism that is able to compensate for the element losses in\nthe upper atmosphere, to keep the extrasolar weather cycle running. In this\npaper, we introduce a new cloud formation model by combining the cloud particle\nmoment method of Helling & Woitke with a diffusive mixing approach, taking into\naccount turbulent mixing and gas-kinetic diffusion for both gas and cloud\nparticles. The equations are of diffusion-reaction type and are solved\ntime-dependently for a prescribed 1D atmospheric structure, until the model has\nrelaxed toward a time-independent solution. In comparison to our previous\nmodels, the new hot Jupiter model results (Teff=2000K, log g=3) show fewer but\nlarger cloud particles which are more concentrated towards the cloud base. The\nabundances of condensable elements in the gas phase are featured by a steep\ndecline above the cloud base, followed by a shallower, monotonous decrease\ntowards a plateau, the level of which depends on temperature. The chemical\ncomposition of the cloud particles also differs significantly from our previous\nmodels. Due to the condensation of specific condensates like Mg2SiO4[s] in\ndeeper layers, certain elements, such as Mg, are almost entirely removed from\nthe gas phase early. This leads to unusual (and non-solar) element ratios in\nhigher atmospheric layers, which then favours the formation of SiO[s] and\nSiO2[s], for example, rather than MgSiO3[s]. Such condensates are not expected\nin phase-equilibrium models that start from solar abundances. Above the main\nsilicate cloud layer, which is enriched with iron and metal oxides, we find a\nsecond cloud layer made of Na2S[s] particles in cooler models (Teff<1500K).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2019 21:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

The objective of this\npaper is to develop and test a computationally efficient model that can support\nseasonal planning while preserving key aspects of system operation over hourly\nand daily timeframes. To do so, an energy system optimization model is\nrepurposed for seasonal planning using features drawn from a unit commitment\nmodel.

Coupling the extensive\nrange of migration data now available with these recent theoretical and\nmethodological advances, we endeavour to advance beyond Ravenstein's\nunderstanding by examining the direction of population redistribution and\ncomparing the impact of internal migration on patterns of human settlement in\n27 European countries. Results show that the overall redistributive impact of\ninternal migration is low in most European countries but the mechanisms differ\nacross the continent. In Southern and Eastern Europe migration effectiveness is\nabove average but is offset by low migration intensities, whereas in Northern\nand Western Europe high intensities are absorbed in reciprocal flows resulting\nin low migration effectiveness.

Its importance has further\nincreased recently due to the growing need for large-scale datasets to train\ndeep learning models. Weak or noisy supervision could originate from multiple\nsources including non-expert annotators or automatic labeling based on\nheuristics or user interaction signals. There is an extensive amount of\nprevious work focusing on leveraging noisy labels. Most notably, recent work\nhas shown impressive gains by using a meta-learned instance re-weighting\napproach where a meta-learning framework is used to assign instance weights to\nnoisy labels. In this paper, we extend this approach via posing the problem as\nlabel correction problem within a meta-learning framework. We view the label\ncorrection procedure as a meta-process and propose a new meta-learning based\nframework termed MLC (Meta Label Correction) for learning with noisy labels.\nSpecifically, a label correction network is adopted as a meta-model to produce\ncorrected labels for noisy labels while the main model is trained to leverage\nthe corrected labeled. Both models are jointly trained by solving a bi-level\noptimization problem. We run extensive experiments with different label noise\nlevels and types on both image recognition and text classification tasks.

However, how to generate dynamic graphs with indirect links for\nmodeling diffusion remains an unsolved challenge. Here, we present a dynamic\ncontact graph model for generating contact networks with direct and indirect\nlinks. Our model introduces the concept of multiple concurrently active copies\nof a node for capturing indirect transmission links. The SPDT graph model\nbuilds on activity driven time-varying network modelling for generating dynamic\ncontact networks using simple statistical distributions. This model is fitted\nwith a large city-scale empirical dataset using maximum likelihood estimation\nmethods. Finally, the performance of the model is evaluated by analysing the\ncapability of capturing the network properties observed in empirical graphs\nconstructed using the location updates of a social networking app and\nsimulating SPDT diffusion processes. Our results show that, in comparison to\ncurrent graph models that only include direct links, our graph model with\nindirect links match empirical network properties and diffusion dynamics much\nmore closely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Nov 2019 00:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

In this\npaper, by exploiting the anisotropic decay rates of the velocity, which are\neven not integrable, we prove the global well-posedness in both $2D$ and $3D$,\nwithout any low frequency assumption of the initial data.

Individuals decide whether to contribute data\nwhen faced with the privacy issue. Due to the intrinsic uncertainty in privacy\nprotection, we model individuals' privacy-related decision using Prospect\nTheory. Such a theory more accurately models individuals' behavior under\nuncertainty than the traditional expected utility theory, whose prediction\nalways deviates from practical human behavior. We show that the data\ncollector's utility maximization problem involves a polynomial of high and\nfractional order, the root of which is difficult to compute analytically.

A promising method to address\nthis is to perform mixed-precision quantization, where more sensitive layers\nare kept at higher precision. However, the search space for a mixed-precision\nquantization is exponential in the number of layers.

For example, given a statement that \"we shouldn't lower our\nstandards to hire more women,\" most listeners will infer the implicature\nintended by the speaker -- that \"women (candidates) are less qualified.\" Most\nsemantic formalisms, to date, do not capture such pragmatic implications in\nwhich people express social biases and power differentials in language.\n  We introduce Social Bias Frames, a new conceptual formalism that aims to\nmodel the pragmatic frames in which people project social biases and\nstereotypes onto others.

Particularly, we can flexibly regulate the skyrmion motion by\nVCMA or voltage controlled Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (VCDMI) in the SOT\ncase. Furthermore, 3-bit stochastic multiplier and adder are demonstrated by\nmicromagnetic simulations. In addition, simulations in synthetic\nantiferromagnets (SAF) show that the performance of our skyrmionic logic gates\ncan be optimized through advanced materials. Our work opens up perspective to\nimplement SC using skyrmionic logic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Nov 2019 12:06:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 03:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

Firstly, we propose that the cosmological\nconstant can be effectively derived from the matter fields and its value varies\nwith the matter fields perturbing the black hole. Meanwhile, we assume that the\nperturbation satisfies the stability condition. This condition means that after\na long time of the perturbation, the black hole solution also belongs to the\nfamily of the RN-AdS solution. After that, based on both the stability\ncondition and the null energy condition, while using the off-shell variation\nmethod, the first-order and the second-order perturbation inequalities are\nderived respectively when the cosmological constant is considered as a dynamic\nvariable.

This paper\nintegrates the YOLO detection network, which is considered a state-of-the-art\ntool for real-time object detection, with motion vectors and the Coyote\nOptimization Algorithm (COA) to construct a real-time human action localization\nand tracking system.

The COA is used in object tracking due to its accuracy\nand fast convergence. The basic foundation of the proposed model is the\nutilization of motion vectors, which already exist in a compressed video bit\nstream and provide sufficient information to improve the localization of the\ntarget action without requiring high consumption of computational resources\ncompared with other popular methods of extracting motion information, such as\noptical flows.

In this paper, we propose a novel semi-heterogeneous\nthree-way joint embedding network (Semi3-Net), which integrates three branches\n(a sketch branch, a natural image branch, and an edgemap branch) to learn more\ndiscriminative cross-domain feature representations for the SBIR task. The key\ninsight lies with how we cultivate the mutual and subtle relationships amongst\nthe sketches, natural images, and edgemaps. A semi-heterogeneous feature\nmapping is designed to extract bottom features from each domain, where the\nsketch and edgemap branches are shared while the natural image branch is\nheterogeneous to the other branches. In addition, a joint semantic embedding is\nintroduced to embed the features from different domains into a common\nhigh-level semantic space, where all of the three branches are shared. To\nfurther capture informative features common to both natural images and the\ncorresponding edgemaps, a co-attention model is introduced to conduct common\nchannel-wise feature recalibration between different domains.
