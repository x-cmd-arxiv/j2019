One of the key challenges in this problem is to\nmodel the customer substitution behavior. Many parametric random utility\nmaximization (RUM) based choice models have been considered in the literature.\nHowever, in all these models, probability of purchase increases as we include\nmore products to an assortment. This is not true in general and in many\nsettings more choices hurt sales. This is commonly referred to as the choice\noverload. In this paper we attempt to address this limitation in RUM through a\ngeneralization of the Markov chain based choice model considered in Blanchet et\nal. (2016). As a special case, we show that our model reduces to a\ngeneralization of MNL with no-purchase attractions dependent on the assortment\nS and strictly increasing with the size of assortment S. While we show that the\nassortment optimization under this model is NP-hard, we present fully\npolynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) under reasonable assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:02:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 16:34:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 17:15:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 04:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

By means of\nlarge-scale simulations we investigate the structural properties of nanogels at\nliquid-liquid (A-B) interfaces and the miscibility of the liquids inside the\nnanogels, covering the whole range of interfacial strength from the limit of\nsingle-liquid to the case of stiff interfaces. To study the role of the\ninternal architecture and deformability of the nanogel we simulate a realistic\ndisordered and an ideal regular network, for a broad range of cross-linking\ndegrees. Unlike in previous investigations on liquid miscibility, excluded\nvolume interactions are considered for both the monomers and the explicit\nsolvent particles. The nanogel permeability is analysed by using an unbiased\ngrid representation that accounts for the surface fluctuations and adds to the\ndensity profiles the exact number of liquid particles inside the nanogel. The\nbetter packing efficiency of the regular network leads to higher values of the\ntotal liquid uptake and the invasive capacity (A-particles in B-side and\nviceversa than in the disordered network, though differences vanish in the\nlimit of rigid interfaces. Uptake and invasion are optimized at a cross-linking\ndegree that depends on the interfacial strength, tending to 15 - 20% for\nmoderate and stiff interfaces. As the interfacial strength increases, the\nmiscibility inside the nanogel is enhanced by a factor of up to 5 with respect\nto the bare interface, with the disordered networks providing a better mixing\nthan their ideal counterparts.

Since estimating the value of\nthe coefficient in a principled manner appears to be intractable for general\nclusters, we investigate \"ideal clusters\", i.e. identical spherical clusters\nwith no overlaps and no outlier background noise. In this paper: (a) We derive,\nfor the case of ideal clusters, rigorous bounds for the coefficient of the\nadditive penalty. Unsurprisingly, the bounds depend on the correct number of\nclusters, which we want to find in the first place. We further show that\nadditive penalty, even for this simplest case of ideal clusters, typically\nproduces a weak and often ambiguous signature for the correct number of\nclusters. (b) As an alternative, we examine the k-means with multiplicative\npenalty, and show that this parameter-free formulation has a stronger, and less\noften ambiguous, signature for the correct number of clusters.

In\nfact, as discussed in recent literature, bypassing such a trade-off is still an\nopen problem even in routine binary regression models, and there is limited\ntheory on the quality of variational approximations in high-dimensional\nsettings. To address this gap, we study the approximation accuracy of\nroutinely-used mean-field variational Bayes solutions in high-dimensional\nprobit regression with Gaussian priors, obtaining novel and practically\nrelevant results on the pathological behavior of such strategies in uncertainty\nquantification, point estimation and prediction. Motivated by these results, we\nfurther develop a new partially-factorized variational approximation for the\nposterior of the probit coefficients which leverages a representation with\nglobal and local variables but, unlike for classical mean-field assumptions, it\navoids a fully factorized approximation, and instead assumes a factorization\nonly for the local variables. We prove that the resulting approximation belongs\nto a tractable class of unified skew-normal densities that crucially\nincorporates skewness and, unlike for state-of-the-art mean-field solutions,\nconverges to the exact posterior density as p goes to infinity. To solve the\nvariational optimization problem, we derive a tractable CAVI algorithm that\neasily scales to p in the tens of thousands, and provably requires a number of\niterations converging to 1 as p goes to infinity. Such findings are also\nillustrated in extensive empirical studies where our novel solution is shown to\nimprove the approximation accuracy of mean-field variational Bayes for any n\nand p, with the magnitude of these gains being remarkable in those\nhigh-dimensional p>n settings where state-of-the-art methods are\ncomputationally impractical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:51:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 14:33:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 13:56:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 17:04:49 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 05:53:25 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 11:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-14"}

In a joint fit with both approaches, tension occurs\nbetween their preferred mass-squared differences $ \\Delta\nm_{31}^{2}=m_{3}^{2}-m_{1}^{2} $ within the wrong mass ordering. In the case of\nJUNO and the IceCube Upgrade, this allows to exclude the wrong ordering at\n$>5\\sigma$ on a timescale of 3--7 years --- even under circumstances that are\nunfavorable to the experiments' individual sensitivities. For PINGU, a\n26-string detector array designed as a potential low-energy extension to\nIceCube, the inverted ordering could be excluded within 1.5 years (3 years for\nthe normal ordering) in a joint analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:53:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

Among others,\nthis includes the spectrum scarcity and massive connectivity of devices,\nparticularly in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. In this\nrespect, visible light communication (VLC) has recently emerged as a potential\nsolution for these challenges, particularly in scenarios relating to indoor\ncommunications. Additionally, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for VLC has\nbeen envisioned to address some of the key challenges in the next generation\nwireless networks. However, in realistic environments, it has been shown that\nVLC systems suffer from additive optical interference due to ambient light, and\nuser-mobility which cause detrimental outages and overall degraded data rates.\nMotivated by this, in this work, we first derive the statistics of the incurred\nadditive interference, and then analyze the rate of the considered NOMA-VLC\nchannel. An analytical expression is subsequently derived for the rate of\nNOMA-VLC systems with ambient light and user-mobility, followed by the\nformulation of a power-allocation technique for the underlying scenario, which\nhas been shown to outperform classical gain-ratio power allocation in terms of\nachievable rate. The obtained analytical results are corroborated with computer\nsimulations for various realistic VLC scenarios of interest, which lead to\nuseful insights of theoretical and practical interest. For example, it is shown\nthat, in a NOMA-enabled VLC system, the maximum rate at which information can\nbe transmitted over a static VLC communication channel with ambient light\nasymptotically converges to the Shannon Hartley capacity formula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 17:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-18"}

We\nbridge the gap between these scales by demonstrating convergence to a\nmean-field limit for a general class of stochastic models representing each\nindividual ecological event in the limit of large system size. The proof relies\non classical stochastic coupling techniques that we generalize to cover\nspatially extended interactions. The mean-field limit is a spatially extended\nnon-Markovian process characterized by nonlocal integro-differential equations\ndescribing the evolution of the probability for a patch of land to be in a\ngiven state (the generalized Kolmogorov equations of the process, GKEs). We\nthus provide an accessible general framework for spatially extending many\nclassical finite-state models from ecology and population dynamics. We\ndemonstrate the practical effectiveness of our approach through a detailed\ncomparison of our limiting spatial model and the finite-size version of a\nspecific savanna-forest model, the so-called Staver-Levin model. There is\nremarkable dynamic consistency between the GKEs and the finite-size system, in\nspite of almost sure forest extinction in the finite-size system. To resolve\nthis apparent paradox, we show that the extinction rate drops sharply when\nnontrivial equilibria emerge in the GKEs, and that the finite-size system's\nquasi-stationary distribution (stationary distribution conditional on\nnon-extinction) closely matches the bifurcation diagram of the GKEs.\nFurthermore, the limit process can support periodic oscillations of the\nprobability distribution, thus providing an elementary example of a jump\nprocess that does not converge to a stationary distribution.

Furthermore, a property is proximity oblivious-testable\n(PO-testable) if the test is also independent of the proximity parameter\n$\\epsilon$. It is known that a number of natural properties such as linearity\nand being a low degree polynomial are PO-testable. These properties are\nexamples of linear-invariant properties, meaning that they are preserved under\nlinear automorphisms of the domain. Following work of Kaufman and Sudan, the\nstudy of linear-invariant properties has been an important problem in\narithmetic property testing.\n  A central conjecture in this field, proposed by Bhattacharyya, Grigorescu,\nand Shapira, is that a linear-invariant property is testable if and only if it\nis semi subspace-hereditary. We prove two results, the first resolves this\nconjecture and the second classifies PO-testable properties.\n  (1) A linear-invariant property is testable if and only if it is semi\nsubspace-hereditary.\n  (2) A linear-invariant property is PO-testable if and only if it is locally\ncharacterized.\n  Our innovations are two-fold.

In particular, those based on the spontaneous\nreconstitution/activation of the apo-PQQ-dependent soluble glucose\ndehydrogenase (sGDH) from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus were widely developed.\nHowever, the reconstitution mechanism of sGDH with its two cofactors, i.e. the\npyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) and Ca2+, remains unknown. The objective here is\nto elucidate this mechanism by stopped-flow kinetics under single-turnover\nconditions. The reconstitution of sGDH exhibited biphasic kinetics,\ncharacteristic of a square reaction scheme associated to two activation\npathways. From a complete kinetic analysis, we were able to fully predict the\nreconstitution dynamic, but also to demonstrate that when PQQ first binds to\nthe apo-sGDH, it strongly impedes the access of Ca2+ to its enclosed position\nat the bottom of the enzyme binding site, thereby greatly slowing down the\nreconstitution rate of sGDH. This slow calcium insertion may purposely be\naccelerated by providing more flexibility to the Ca2+ binding loop through the\nspecific mutation of the calcium coordinating P248 proline residue, reducing\nthus the kinetic barrier to calcium ion insertion. The dynamic nature of the\nreconstitution process is also supported by the observation of a clear loop\nshift and a reorganization of the hydrogen bonding network and van der Waals\ninteractions observed in both active sites of the apo and holo forms, a\nstructural change modulation that was revealed from the refined X-ray structure\nof apo-sGDH (PDB:5MIN).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 18:35:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-18"}

It consists of a coupled problem\nof vacancy diffusion and mechanics where the vacancy generation/absorption at\ngrain boundaries is driven by grain boundary dislocations climb. The model is\nstated in terms of general balance laws and completed by the choice of\nconstitutive equations consistent with classical non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics. The kinetics of diffusional creep is derived from\nphysically-based mechanisms of climb of dislocations at grain boundaries, thus\nintroducing a dependence of diffusional creep on the density and mobility of\nboundary dislocations. Several representative examples have been solved using\nthe finite element method and assuming representative volume elements made up\nof an array of regular-shaped crystals. The effect of stress, temperature,\ngrain size, and grain boundary dislocation mobility is analyzed and compared\nwith classical theories of diffusional creep. The simulation results\ndemonstrate the ability of the present model to reproduce the macroscopic\nstress and grain size dependence observed under both diffusion and interface\ncontrolled regimes as well the evolution of this dependency with the\ntemperature. In addition, the numerical implementation of the model allows to\npredict the evolution of microscopic fields through the microstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 18:46:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-18"}

The motion of the capsule is simulated\nusing a model that incorporates shear elasticity, area dilatation, and bending\nresistance. Here the deformability of the capsule is characterized by capillary\nnumber Ca, which represents the ratio of viscous stresses to elastic restoring\nstresses. For a capsule with small bending stiffness, at a given Ca, the\norientation converges over time towards a unique stable orbit independent of\nthe initial orientation. With increasing Ca, four dynamical modes are found for\nthe stable orbit: rolling, wobbling, oscillating-swinging, and swinging. For a\ncapsule with large bending stiffness, multiplicity in the orbit dynamics is\nobserved. When the viscosity ratio $\\lambda \\lesssim 1$, the long-axis of the\ncapsule always tends towards a stable orbit in the flow-gradient plane, either\ntumbling or swinging, depending on Ca. When $\\lambda \\gtrsim 1$, the stable\norbit of the capsule is a tumbling motion at low Ca, irrespective of the\ninitial orientation. Upon increasing Ca, there is a symmetry-breaking\nbifurcation away from the tumbling orbit, and the capsule is observed to adopt\nmultiple stable orbital modes including nonsymmetric precessing and rolling,\ndepending on the initial orientation. As Ca further increases, the nonsymmetric\nstable orbit loses existence at a saddle-node bifurcation, and rolling becomes\nthe only attractor at high Ca, whereas the rolling state coexists with the\nnonsymmetric state at intermediate values of Ca. A symmetry-breaking\nbifurcation away from the rolling orbit is also found upon decreasing Ca. The\nregime with multiple attractors becomes broader as the aspect ratio of the\ncapsule increases, while narrowing as viscosity ratio increases. We also report\nthe particle contribution to the stress, which also displays multiplicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 18:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-18"}

The\nmain objectives of this work include: (i) estimation of the sensitivity of the\ntotal-body PET scanners for the ortho-positronium mean lifetime imaging using\n$2\\gamma$ annihilations, and (ii) estimation of the spatial and time resolution\nof the ortho-positronium image as a function of the coincidence resolving time\n(CRT) of the scanner. Simulations are conducted assuming that\nradiopharmaceutical is labelled with $^{44}Sc$ isotope emitting one positron\nand one prompt gamma. The image is reconstructed on the basis of triple\ncoincidence events. The ortho-positronium lifetime spectrum is determined for\neach voxel of the image. Calculations were performed for cases of total-body\ndetectors build of (i) LYSO scintillators as used in the EXPLORER PET, and (ii)\nplastic scintillators as anticipated for the cost-effective total-body J-PET\nscanner. To assess the spatial and time resolution the three cases were\nconsidered assuming that CRT is equal to 140ps, 50ps and 10ps. The estimated\ntotal-body PET sensitivity for the registration and selection of image forming\ntriple coincidences is larger by a factor of 12.2 (for LYSO PET) and by factor\nof 4.7 (for plastic PET) with respect to the sensitivity for the standard\n$2\\gamma$ imaging by LYSO PET scanners with AFOV=20cm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 19:23:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

The typical approaches for nonlinear system identification\ninclude Volterra series models, nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs\nmodels, block-structured models, state-space models and neural network models.\nAmong them, neural networks (NN) is an important black-box method thanks to its\nuniversal approximation capability and less dependency on prior information.\nHowever, there are several challenges associated with NN. The first one lies in\nthe design of a proper neural network structure. A relatively simple network\ncannot approximate the feature of the system, while a complex model may lead to\noverfitting. The second lies in the availability of data for some nonlinear\nsystems. For some systems, it is difficult to collect enough data to train a\nneural network. This raises the challenge that how to train a neural network\nfor system identification with a small dataset. In addition, if the uncertainty\nof the NN parameter could be obtained, it would be also beneficial for further\nanalysis.

The modern Earth's atmosphere-ocean system has\na much larger chemical disequilibrium than other solar system planets with\natmospheres because of oxygenic photosynthesis. However, no analysis exists\ncomparing disequilibrium on lifeless, prebiotic planets to disequilibrium on\nworlds with primitive chemotrophic biospheres that live off chemicals and not\nlight. Here, we use a photochemical-microbial ecosystem model to calculate the\natmosphere-ocean disequilibria of Earth with no life and with a chemotrophic\nbiosphere. We show that the prebiotic Earth likely had a relatively large\natmosphere-ocean disequilibrium due to the coexistence of water and volcanic\nH2, CO2, and CO. Subsequent chemotrophic life probably destroyed nearly all of\nthe prebiotic disequilibrium through its metabolism, leaving a likely smaller\ndisequilibrium between N2, CO2, CH4, and liquid water. So, disequilibrium fell\nwith the rise of chemotrophic life then later rose with atmospheric oxygenation\ndue to oxygenic photosynthesis. We conclude that big prebiotic disequilibrium\nbetween H2 and CO2 or CO and water is an anti-biosignature because these easily\nmetabolized species can be eaten due to redox reactions with low activation\nenergy barriers. However, large chemical disequilibrium can also be a\nbiosignature when the disequilibrium arises from a chemical mixture with\nbiologically insurmountable activation energy barriers, and clearly\nidentifiable biogenic gases. Earth's modern disequilibrium between O2, N2, and\nliquid water along with minor CH4 is such a case. Thus, the interpretation of\ndisequilibrium requires context.

An approximation of the emission peaks with Gaussian\nfunctions allows for an efficient and straightforward extraction of useful\nphysical information contained in the shape and Doppler-shifted frequency of\nthe emission lines contained in these enormous data sets. In this work we\npresent an overview and first results of a Gaussian decomposition of the entire\nGalactic Ring Survey (GRS) 13CO (1-0) data that consists of about 2.3 million\nspectra. We performed the decomposition with the fully automated GaussPy+\nalgorithm and fitted about 4.6 million Gaussian components to the GRS spectra.\nWe discuss the statistics of the fit components and relations between the\nfitted intensities, velocity centroids, and velocity dispersions. We find that\nthe magnitude of the velocity dispersion values increase toward the inner\nGalaxy and around the Galactic midplane, which we speculate is partly due to\nthe influence of the Galactic bar and regions with higher non-thermal motions\nlocated in the midplane, respectively. We also use our decomposition results to\ninfer global properties of the gas emission and find that the number of fit\ncomponents used per spectrum is indicative for the amount of structure along\nthe line of sight. We find that the emission lines from regions located on the\nfar side of the Galaxy show increased velocity dispersion values, likely due to\nbeam averaging effects. We demonstrate how this trend has the potential to aid\nin characterising Galactic structure by disentangling emission that is\nbelonging to the nearby Aquila Rift molecular cloud from emission that is more\nlikely associated with the Perseus and Outer spiral arms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 20:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-25"}

For neutron stars, achieving such\nmasses typically requires extreme compactness and in this work we present\ninitial data and evolutions of binary neutron stars initially in\nquasiequilibrium circular orbits having a compactness $C=0.336$. These are the\nmost compact, nonvacuum, quasiequilibrium binary objects that have been\nconstructed and evolved to date, including boson stars. The compactness\nachieved is only slightly smaller than the maximum possible imposed by\ncausality, $C_{\\rm max}=0.355$, which requires the sound speed to be less than\nthe speed of light. By comparing the emitted gravitational waveforms from the\nlate inspiral to merger and postmerger phases between such a binary neutron\nstar vs a binary black hole of the same total mass we identify concrete\nmeasurements that serve to distinguish them. With that level of compactness,\nthe binary neutron stars exhibit no tidal disruption up until merger, whereupon\na prompt collapse is initiated even before a common core forms. Within the\naccuracy of our simulations the black hole remnants from both binaries exhibit\nringdown radiation that is not distinguishable from a perturbed Kerr spacetime.\nHowever, their inspiral leads to phase differences of the order of $\\sim 5$ rad\nover an $\\sim 81$ km separation (1.7 orbits) while typical neutron stars\nexhibit phase differences of $\\geq 20$ rad.

The power spectrum of solar activity recorded in sunspot data\nis dominated by the $\\sim$11-year quasi-periodicity, known as the Schwabe\ncycle. In the mid-term range (1 month -- 11 years) a pronounced variability\nknown as a quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is widely discussed. In the shorter\ntime scale a pronounced peak, corresponding to the synodic solar rotation\nperiod ($\\sim$ 27 days) is observed. Here we revisited the mid-term solar\nvariability in terms of statistical dynamic of fully turbulent systems, where\nsolid arguments are required to accept an isolated dominant frequency in a\ncontinuous (smooth) spectrum. For that, we first undertook an unbiased analysis\nof the standard solar data, sunspot numbers and the F10.7 solar radioflux\nindex, by applying a wavelet tool, which allows one to perform a frequency-time\nanalysis of the signal. Considering the spectral dynamics of solar activity\ncycle by cycle, we showed that no single periodicity can be separated, in a\nstatistically significant manner, in the specified range of periods. We examine\nwhether a model of solar dynamo can reproduce the mid-term oscillation pattern\nobserved in solar data. We found that a realistically observed spectrum can be\nexplained if small spatial (but not temporal) scales are effectively smoothed.\nThis result is important because solar activity is a it global feature,\nalthough monitored via small-scale tracers like sunspots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 21:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

These\nstatistics are popularly referred to as variance partition coefficients (VPCs)\nand intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). When fitting multilevel models\nto categorical (binary, ordinal, or nominal) and count responses, these\nstatistics prove more challenging to calculate. For categorical response\nmodels, researchers appeal to their latent response formulations and report\nVPCs/ICCs in terms of latent continuous responses envisaged to underly the\nobserved categorical responses.

The closure of these equations is based on an\nasymmetric treatment of the ionic species with respect to their electrostatic\ncoupling strength; the weakly coupled monovalent ions are treated within a\ngaussian approximation while the multivalent counterions of high coupling\nstrength are incorporated with a strong-coupling approach. The resulting\nself-consistent formalism includes explicitly the interactions of the\nmultivalent counterions with the monovalent salt. In highly charged membranes\ncharacterized by a pronounced multivalent counterion adsorption, these\ninteractions take over the salt-membrane charge coupling. As a result, the\nincrement of the negative membrane charge brings further salt anions into the\npore and excludes salt cations from the pore into the reservoir. The\ncorresponding like-charge attraction and opposite-charge repulsion effect is\namplified by the pore confinement but suppressed by salt addition into the\nreservoir. The effect is particularly pronounced in high dielectric membranes\nwhere the attractive polarization forces lead to a dense multivalent cation\nlayer at the membrane walls. These cation layers act as an effective positive\nsurface charge, resulting in a total monovalent cation exclusion and a strong\nanion excess even in the case of neutral membrane walls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 22:39:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-06"}

We propose a novel curriculum learning\napproach for image classification that adapts the loss function by changing the\nlabel representation. The idea is to use a probability distribution over\nclasses as target label, where the class probabilities reflect the similarity\nto the true class. Gradually, this label representation is shifted towards the\nstandard one-hot-encoding. That is, in the beginning minor mistakes are\ncorrected less than large mistakes, resembling a teaching process in which\nbroad concepts are explained first before subtle differences are taught.\n  The class similarity can be based on prior knowledge. For the special case of\nthe labels being natural words, we propose a generic way to automatically\ncompute the similarities. The natural words are embedded into Euclidean space\nusing a standard word embedding. The probability of each class is then a\nfunction of the cosine similarity between the vector representations of the\nclass and the true label. The proposed label-similarity curriculum learning\n(LCL) approach was empirically evaluated using several popular deep learning\narchitectures for image classification tasks applied to five datasets including\nImageNet, CIFAR100, and AWA2.

GANs create impressive data primarily through a\nnew type of operator called deconvolution (DeConv) or transposed convolution\n(Conv). To implement the DeConv layer in hardware, the state-of-the-art\naccelerator reduces the high computational complexity via the DeConv-to-Conv\nconversion and achieves the same results. However, there is a problem that the\nnumber of filters increases due to this conversion. Recently, Winograd minimal\nfiltering has been recognized as an effective solution to improve the\narithmetic complexity and resource efficiency of the Conv layer. In this paper,\nwe propose an efficient Winograd DeConv accelerator that combines these two\northogonal approaches on FPGAs. Firstly, we introduce a new class of fast\nalgorithm for DeConv layers using Winograd minimal filtering. Since there are\nregular sparse patterns in Winograd filters, we further amortize the\ncomputational complexity by skipping zero weights. Secondly, we propose a new\ndataflow to prevent resource underutilization by reorganizing the filter layout\nin the Winograd domain. Finally, we propose an efficient architecture for\nimplementing Winograd DeConv by designing the line buffer and exploring the\ndesign space. Experimental results on various GANs show that our accelerator\nachieves up to 1.78x~8.38x speedup over the state-of-the-art DeConv\naccelerators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 23:49:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

We\ndesign algorithms that decide time points for each worker to commit its model\nupdate, and ensure not only global model convergence but also faster\nconvergence. Our testbed implementation and experiments show that ADSP\noutperforms existing parameter synchronization models significantly in terms of\nML model convergence time, scalability and adaptability to large heterogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Nov 2019 03:47:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

Timely and\nsensitive pathogenic bacteria detection is crucial in identifying the bacterial\ncontaminations and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Due to\nlimitations of conventional bacteria detection techniques there have been\nconcerted research efforts towards development of new biosensors. Biosensors\noffering label free, whole bacteria detection are highly desirable over those\nrelying on label based or pathogenic molecular components detection. The major\nadvantage is eliminating the additional time and cost required for labeling or\nextracting the desired bacterial components. Here, we demonstrate rapid,\nsensitive and label free E. coli detection utilizing interferometric\nreflectance imaging enhancement allowing for visualizing individual pathogens\ncaptured on the surface. Enabled by our ability to count individual bacteria on\na large sensor surface, we demonstrate a limit of detection of 2.2 CFU/ml from\na buffer solution with no sample preparation. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis high level of sensitivity for whole E. coli detection is unprecedented in\nlabel free biosensing. The specificity of our biosensor is validated by\ncomparing the response to target bacteria E. coli and non target bacteria S.\naureus, K. pneumonia and P. aeruginosa. The biosensor performance in tap water\nalso proves that its detection capability is unaffected by the sample\ncomplexity. Furthermore, our sensor platform provides high optical\nmagnification imaging and thus validation of recorded detection events as the\ntarget bacteria based on morphological characterization. Therefore, our\nsensitive and label free detection method offers new perspectives for direct\nbacterial detection in real matrices and clinical samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Nov 2019 03:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

Here we present our analysis of the Cassini\nGrand Finale magnetometer (MAG) dataset, focusing on Saturn's internal magnetic\nfield. These measurements demonstrate that Saturn's internal magnetic field is\nexceptionally axisymmetric, with a dipole tilt less than 0.007 degrees (25.2\narcsecs). Saturn's magnetic equator was directly measured to be shifted\nnorthward by ~ 0.0468 +/- 0.00043 (1-sigma) $R_S$, 2820 +/- 26 km, at\ncylindrical radial distances between 1.034 and 1.069 $R_S$ from the spin-axis.\nAlthough almost perfectly axisymmetric, Saturn's internal magnetic field\nexhibits features on many characteristic length scales in the latitudinal\ndirection. Examining Br at the a=0.75 $R_S$, c=0.6993 $R_S$ isobaric surface,\nthe degrees 4 to 11 contributions correspond to latitudinally banded magnetic\nperturbations with characteristic width similar to that of the off-equatorial\nzonal jets observed in the atmosphere of Saturn. Saturn's internal magnetic\nfield beyond 60 degrees latitude, in particular the small-scale features, are\nless well constrained by the available measurements, mainly due to incomplete\nspatial coverage in the polar region. A stably stratified layer thicker than\n2500 km likely exists above Saturn's deep dynamo to filter out the\nnon-axisymmetric internal magnetic field. A heat transport mechanism other than\npure conduction, e.g. double diffusive convection, must be operating within\nthis layer to be compatible with Saturn's observed luminosity. The\nlatitudinally banded magnetic perturbations likely arise from a shallow\nsecondary dynamo action with latitudinally banded differential rotation in the\nsemi-conducting layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Nov 2019 04:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

To address this problem, we explicitly\nintroduce a new challenging problem -- how to learn a robust deep model with\nlimited training samples per class, called defensive few-shot learning in this\npaper. Simply employing the existing adversarial training techniques in the\nliterature cannot solve this problem. This is because few-shot learning needs\nto learn transferable knowledge from disjoint auxiliary data, and thus it is\ninvalid to assume the sample-level distribution consistency between the\ntraining and test sets as commonly assumed in existing adversarial training\ntechniques. In this paper, instead of assuming such a distribution consistency,\nwe propose to make this assumption at a task-level in the episodic training\nparadigm in order to better transfer the defense knowledge. Furthermore, inside\neach task, we design a task-conditioned distribution constraint to narrow the\ndistribution gap between clean and adversarial examples at a sample-level.\nThese give rise to a novel mechanism called multi-level distribution based\nadversarial training (MDAT) for learning transferable adversarial defense. In\naddition, a unified $\\mathcal{F}_{\\beta}$ score is introduced to evaluate\ndifferent defense methods under the same principle. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that MDAT achieves higher effectiveness and robustness over\nexisting alternatives in the few-shot case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Nov 2019 05:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

GPM systems have been developed to provide unified interfaces\nfor programming algorithms for these problems and for running them on parallel\nsystems.

Pangolin is the first GPM system that\nprovides high-level abstractions for GPU processing. It provides a simple\nprogramming interface based on the extend-reduce-filter model, which enables\nusers to specify application-specific knowledge for search space pruning and\nisomorphism test elimination. We describe novel optimizations that exploit\nlocality, reduce memory consumption, and mitigate the overheads of dynamic\nmemory allocation and synchronization.\n  Evaluation on a 28-core CPU demonstrates that Pangolin outperforms existing\nGPM frameworks Arabesque, RStream, and Fractal by 49x, 88x, and 80x on average,\nrespectively.

Leading methods for\nlearning generative models of shapes rely on implicit functions, and generate\nmeshes only after expensive iso-surfacing routines. To overcome these\nchallenges, we are inspired by a classical spatial data structure from computer\ngraphics, Binary Space Partitioning (BSP), to facilitate 3D learning. The core\ningredient of BSP is an operation for recursive subdivision of space to obtain\nconvex sets. By exploiting this property, we devise BSP-Net, a network that\nlearns to represent a 3D shape via convex decomposition. Importantly, BSP-Net\nis unsupervised since no convex shape decompositions are needed for training.\nThe network is trained to reconstruct a shape using a set of convexes obtained\nfrom a BSP-tree built on a set of planes. The convexes inferred by BSP-Net can\nbe easily extracted to form a polygon mesh, without any need for iso-surfacing.\nThe generated meshes are compact (i.e., low-poly) and well suited to represent\nsharp geometry; they are guaranteed to be watertight and can be easily\nparameterized.

In particular, by\nmeshing a large urban area to a number of fine-grained mesh-grids, citywide\ncrowd and traffic information in a continuous time period can be represented\nlike a video, where each timestamp can be seen as one video frame. Based on\nthis idea, a series of methods have been proposed to address video-like\nprediction for citywide crowd and traffic. In this study, we publish a new\naggregated human mobility dataset generated from a real-world smartphone\napplication and build a standard benchmark for such kind of video-like urban\ncomputing with this new dataset and the existing open datasets. We first\ncomprehensively review the state-of-the-art works of literature and formulate\nthe density and in-out flow prediction problem, then conduct a thorough\nperformance assessment for those methods. With this benchmark, we hope\nresearchers can easily follow up and quickly launch a new solution on this\ntopic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Nov 2019 07:38:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

As a result, the Web runtime system must simultaneously address two\nchallenges: responsiveness and energy-efficiency. Conventional Web runtime\nsystems fall short due to their reactive nature: they react to a user event\nonly after it is triggered. The reactive strategy leads to local optimizations\nthat schedule event executions one at a time, missing global optimization\nopportunities. This paper proposes Proactive Event Scheduling (PES). The key\nidea of PES is to proactively anticipate future events and thereby globally\ncoordinate scheduling decisions across events. Specifically, PES predicts\nevents that are likely to happen in the near future using a combination of\nstatistical inference and application code analysis. PES then speculatively\nexecutes future events ahead of time in a way that satisfies the QoS\nconstraints of all the events while minimizing the global energy consumption.\nFundamentally, PES unlocks more optimization opportunities by enlarging the\nscheduling window, which enables coordination across both outstanding events\nand predicted events. Hardware measurements show that PES reduces the QoS\nviolation and energy consumption by 61.2% and 26.5%, respectively, over the\nAndroid default Interactive CPU governor. It also reduces the QoS violation and\nenergy consumption by 63.1% and 17.9%, respectively, compared to EBS, a\nstate-of-the-art reactive scheduler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 18:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

While existing stereo vision systems make trade-offs between\naccuracy, performance and energy-efficiency, we describe ASV, an accelerated\nstereo vision system that simultaneously improves both performance and\nenergy-efficiency while achieving high accuracy. The key to ASV is to exploit\nunique characteristics inherent to stereo vision, and apply stereo-specific\noptimizations, both algorithmically and computationally. We make two\ncontributions. Firstly, we propose a new stereo algorithm, invariant-based\nstereo matching (ISM), that achieves significant speedup while retaining high\naccuracy. The algorithm combines classic \"hand-crafted\" stereo algorithms with\nrecent developments in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), by leveraging the\ncorrespondence invariant unique to stereo vision systems. Secondly, we observe\nthat the bottleneck of the ISM algorithm is the DNN inference, and in\nparticular the deconvolution operations that introduce massive\ncompute-inefficiencies. We propose a set of software optimizations that\nmitigate these inefficiencies. We show that with less than 0.5% hardware area\noverhead, these algorithmic and computational optimizations can be effectively\nintegrated within a conventional DNN accelerator. Overall, ASV achieves 5x\nspeedup and 85% energy saving with 0.02% accuracy loss compared to today\nDNN-based stereo vision systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 18:44:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

Corrfunc is an\nexisting open-source, high-performance software package for efficiently\ncomputing a multitude of correlation functions. In this paper, we will discuss\nthe SIMD AVX512F kernels within Corrfunc, capable of processing 16 floats or 8\ndoubles at a time.

In addition, by pruning pairs with too large of a minimum\npossible separation, we achieve a $\\sim 5-10\\%$ speedup across all the SIMD\nkernels. Such speedups highlight the importance of programming explicitly with\nSIMD vector intrinsics for complex calculations that can not be efficiently\nvectorized by compilers.

The strong agitation that would be needed stresses\nthe fiber and can lead to focal ratio degradation.

The parametric regimes for the modulational instability of\nthe fast DIA mode, and the criterion for the formation of the DIA rogue waves\nhave been found to be significantly modified by the effects of the relevant\nplasma parameters, particularly, mass and charge state of ion and dust species,\nnumber density of the plasma species, and non-extensive parameter $q$, etc. It\nis found that the modulationally stable parametric regime decreases (increases)\nwith the increase in the value of positive (negative) $q$. The numerical\nanalysis has also shown that the nonlinearity as well as the amplitude and\nwidth of the rogue waves increases (decreases) with the mass of positive ion\n(negative dust grains) while decreases (increases) with the charge state of the\npositive ion (negative dust). The applications of our present work in space\n(viz., Earth ionosphere, magnetosphere, molecular clouds, interstellar medium,\ncometary tails, and planetary rings, etc.) and laboratory plasmas have been\npinpointed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Nov 2019 10:45:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

A central question at the intersection\nof these two areas is concerned with the processes by which neocortex learns,\nand the extent to which they are analogous to the back-propagation training\nalgorithm of deep networks. Matching the data efficiency, transfer and\ngeneralization properties of neocortical learning remains an area of active\nresearch in the field of deep learning. Recent advances in our understanding of\nneuronal, synaptic and dendritic physiology of the neocortex suggest new\napproaches for unsupervised representation learning, perhaps through a new\nclass of objective functions, which could act alongside or in lieu of\nback-propagation. Such local learning rules have implicit rather than explicit\nobjectives with respect to the training data, facilitating domain adaptation\nand generalization.

However,\nit is still unclear how the brain can perform credit assignment across many\nareas as efficiently as backpropagation does in deep neural networks. In this\npaper, we introduce a model that relies on a new role for a neuronal inhibitory\nmachinery, referred to as ghost units. By cancelling the feedback coming from\nthe upper layer when no target signal is provided to the top layer, the ghost\nunits enables the network to backpropagate errors and do efficient credit\nassignment in deep structures. While considering one-compartment neurons and\nrequiring very few biological assumptions, it is able to approximate the error\ngradient and achieve good performance on classification tasks. Error\nbackpropagation occurs through the recurrent dynamics of the network and thanks\nto biologically plausible local learning rules. In particular, it does not\nrequire separate feedforward and feedback circuits. Different mechanisms for\ncancelling the feedback were studied, ranging from complete duplication of the\nconnectivity by long term processes to online replication of the feedback\nactivity. This reduced system combines the essential elements to have a working\nbiologically abstracted analogue of backpropagation with a simple formulation\nand proofs of the associated results. Therefore, this model is a step towards\nunderstanding how learning and memory are implemented in cortical multilayer\nstructures, but it also raises interesting perspectives for neuromorphic\nhardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 17:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}
