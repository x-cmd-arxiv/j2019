We use the thermodynamically constrained\naveraging theory (TCAT) to examine the formulation and closure of a macroscale\nmodel for non-Newtonian flow that is consistent with microscale conservation\nprinciples and the second law of thermodynamics. A connection between\nmicroscale and macroscale quantities is used to calculate interphase momentum\ntransfer for non-Newtonian flow in porous medium systems.

Given\na dataset upon which a self-supervised task is performed while predicting\ninstantiations of a transformation, the hypothesis states that if the predicted\ninstantiations of the transformations are already present in the dataset, then\nthe representation learned will be less useful. The hypothesis was derived by\nobserving a key constraint in the application of self-supervision using a\nparticular transformation. This constraint, which we term the transformation\nconflict for this paper, forces a network learn degenerative features thereby\nreducing the usefulness of the representation. The VTSS hypothesis helps us\nidentify transformations that have the potential to be effective as a\nself-supervision task. Further, it helps to generally predict whether a\nparticular transformation based self-supervision technique would be effective\nor not for a particular dataset. We provide extensive evaluations on CIFAR 10,\nCIFAR 100, SVHN and FMNIST confirming the hypothesis and the trends it\npredicts.

We tackle the\nproblem of teaching a network with a low number of training samples with a\nsystem we call AnoNet. AnoNet's architecture is similar to CompactCNN with the\nexceptions that (1) it is a fully convolutional network and does not use\nstrided convolution; (2) it is shallow and compact which minimizes over-fitting\nby design; (3) the compact design constrains the size of intermediate features\nwhich allows training to be done without image downsizing; (4) the model\nfootprint is low making it suitable for edge computation; and (5) the anomaly\ncan be detected and localized despite the weak labelling. AnoNet learns to\ndetect the underlying shape of the anomalies despite the weak annotation as\nwell as preserves the spatial localization of the anomaly.

Typically,\nalgorithmic work is on total counting, where we wish to count the total\nfrequency of a (small) pattern subgraph in a large input data set. But many\napplications require local counts (also called vertex orbit counts) wherein,\nfor every vertex $v$ of the input graph, one needs the count of the pattern\nsubgraph involving $v$. This provides a rich set of vertex features that can be\nused in machine learning tasks, especially classification and clustering. But\ngetting local counts is extremely challenging. Even the easier problem of\ngetting total counts has received much research attention. Local counts require\nalgorithms that get much finer grained information, and the sheer output size\nmakes it difficult to design scalable algorithms.\n  We present EVOKE, a scalable algorithm that can determine vertex orbits\ncounts for all 5-vertex pattern subgraphs. In other words, EVOKE exactly\ndetermines, for every vertex $v$ of the input graph and every 5-vertex subgraph\n$H$, the number of copies of $H$ that $v$ participates in. EVOKE can process\ngraphs with tens of millions of edges, within an hour on a commodity machine.\nEVOKE is typically hundreds of times faster than previous state of the art\nalgorithms, and gets results on datasets beyond the reach of previous methods.\n  Theoretically, we generalize a recent \"graph cutting\" framework to get vertex\norbit counts. This framework generate a collection of polynomial equations\nrelating vertex orbit counts of larger subgraphs to those of smaller subgraphs.\nEVOKE carefully exploits the structure among these equations to rapidly count.\nWe prove and empirically validate that EVOKE only has a small constant factor\noverhead over the best (total) 5-vertex subgraph counter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2019 21:48:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 07:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-13"}

In 2012 the Geneva\nevolutionary group updated their mass-loss prescription for RSGs with the\nresult that a 20 solar mass star now loses 10x more mass during the RSG phase\nthan in the older models. Thus, higher mass RSGs evolve back through a second\nyellow supergiant phase rather than exploding as Type II-P supernovae, in\naccord with recent observations (the so-called \"RSG Problem\"). Still, even much\nlarger mass-loss rates during the RSG phase cannot be ruled out by direct\nmeasurements of their current dust-production rates, as such mass-loss is\nepisodic. Here we test the models by deriving a luminosity function for RSGs in\nthe nearby spiral galaxy M31 which is sensitive to the total mass loss during\nthe RSG phase. We carefully separate RSGs from asymptotic giant branch stars in\nthe color-magnitude diagram following the recent method exploited by Yang and\ncollaborators in their Small Magellanic Cloud studies.

Recently, due to the rapid development of\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs), there has been significant progress in\nthe field. However, almost all existing GAN-based works are prone to address\nthe mapping from human motions to video scenes, with scene appearances are\nencoded individually in the trained models. Therefore, each trained model can\nonly generate videos with a specific scene appearance, new models are required\nto be trained to generate new appearances. Besides, existing works lack the\ncapability of appearance control. For example, users have to provide video\nrecords of wearing new clothes or performing in new backgrounds to enable\nclothes or background changing in their synthetic videos, which greatly limits\nthe application flexibility. In this paper, we propose GAC-GAN, a general\nmethod for appearance-controllable human video motion transfer. To enable\ngeneral-purpose appearance synthesis, we propose to include appearance\ninformation in the conditioning inputs. Thus, once trained, our model can\ngenerate new appearances by altering the input appearance information. To\nachieve appearance control, we first obtain the appearance-controllable\nconditioning inputs and then utilize a two-stage GAC-GAN to generate the\ncorresponding appearance-controllable outputs, where we utilize an ACGAN loss\nand a shadow extraction module for output foreground and background appearance\ncontrol respectively. We further build a solo dance dataset containing a large\nnumber of dance videos for training and evaluation. Experimental results show\nthat, our proposed GAC-GAN can not only support appearance-controllable human\nvideo motion transfer but also achieve higher video quality than state-of-art\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 02:56:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Feb 2020 15:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

Here, we report having successfully performed this\ntask by applying spatially geometric confinement to a centrosymmetric\nfrustrated Fe3Sn2 magnet. We demonstrate that the spatially geometric\nconfinement can indeed stabilize the skyrmion bubbles, by effectively\nsuppressing the formation of trivial bubbles and metastable skyrmion bubbles.\nWe also show that the critical magnetic field for the nucleation of the\nskyrmion bubbles in the confined Fe3Sn2 nanostripes is drastically less, by an\norder of magnitude, than that what is required in the thin plate without\ngeometrical confinement. By analyzing how the width and thickness of the\nnanostripes affect the spin textures of skyrmion bubbles, we infer that the\ntopological transition of skyrmion bubbles is closely related to the\ndipole-dipole interaction, which we find is consistent with theoretical\nsimulations.

Specifically, we rule out regions of\nX-ray spectral parameter space that do not reproduce the CXB in the energy\nrange 1-100 keV. The key X-ray spectral parameters are the photon index,\n{\\Gamma}; the cutoff energy, Ecutoff; and the reflection scaling factor, R.\nAssuming each parameter follows a Gaussian distribution, we first explore the\nparameter space using a Bayesian approach and a fixed X-ray luminosity function\n(XLF). For {\\sigma}_E = 36 keV and {\\sigma}_R = 0.14, fixed at the observed\nvalues from the Swift-BAT 70-month sample, we allow <R>, <Ecutoff > and\n<{\\Gamma}> to vary subject to reproducing the CXB. We report results for\n{\\sigma}_{\\Gamma} = 0.1-0.5. In an alternative approach, we define the\nparameter distributions, then forward model to fit the CXB by perturbing the\nXLF using a neural network. This approach allows us to rule out parameter\ncombinations that cannot reproduce the CXB for any XLF. The marginalized\nconditional probabilities for the four free parameters are: <R> =\n0.99^{+0.11}_{-0.26}, <Ecutoff> = 118^{+24}_{-23}, {\\sigma}_{\\Gamma} =\n0.101^{+0.097}_{-0.001} and <{\\Gamma}> = 1.9^{+0.08}_{-0.09}.

The distributions observed in many AGN samples can be ruled out by\nour analysis, meaning these samples can not be representative of the full AGN\npopulation.

Therefore,\nsimplifying the learning process is an important research issue. In many\nmulti-agent systems, the interactions between agents often happen locally,\nwhich means that agents neither need to coordinate with all other agents nor\nneed to coordinate with others all the time. Traditional methods attempt to use\npre-defined rules to capture the interaction relationship between agents.\nHowever, the methods cannot be directly used in a large-scale environment due\nto the difficulty of transforming the complex interactions between agents into\nrules.

However, APRES spectra did not show any signature of $\\alpha$-phase\nemerging in the surface-layer from 300 K to 17 K, which implied that\n$\\alpha$-phase might form at the bulk-layer of our Ce thin films. Besides, an\nevident Kondo dip near Fermi energy was observed in the APRES spectrum at 80 K,\nindicting the formation of Kondo singlet states in $\\gamma$-Ce. Furthermore,\nthe DFT+DMFT calculations were performed to simulate the electronic structures\nand the theoretical spectral functions agreed well with the experimental ARPES\nspectra. In $\\gamma$-Ce, the behavior of the self-energy's imaginary part at\nlow frequency not only confirmed that the Kondo singlet states emerged at\n$T_{\\rm KS} \\geq 80$ K, but also implied that they became coherent states at a\nlower characteristic temperature ($T_{\\rm coh}\\sim 40$ K) due to the indirect\nRKKY interaction among $f$-$f$ electrons.

In each cache update period, the\nsegments which cannot bring significant QoE improvement will be deleted and\nmeanwhile more suitable representations of the segments will be cahed instead.\nFirst, we divide the MEC cache space into three parts based on segment\npopularity and segment importance level. In addition, the size of different\ncache parts can be transformed to each other to further exploit the MEC cache\nspace. For different parts, the corresponding deleted strategy and caching\nstrategy are formulated, where the deleted strategy combines the requested\ntimes of segment and transmission capability of clients, and the caching\nstrategy utilizes the playback state of clients to calculate the caching\npriority.

In\nthis work, we give some strategies to teach mathematics, especially to gifted\nstudents and to instill a love of mathematics in them. We will describe an\nintegrated approach to teaching mathematics where students are introduced to\nmore advanced, more elegant and more beautiful aspects of the subject early.\nThe proposed integrated approach takes advantage of the fascinating\ninterconnections between various subfields of mathematics, and even borrows\nfrom advanced topics such as number theory and topology. Combining the teaching\nof computer programming with the teaching of mathematics is another key focus\nof this work. This opens up the door to explore, not only the beautiful topics\nsuch as fractals, computer math art and computer graphics in general, but also\nreal-life applications resulting from computer simulations in engineering and\nphysics and other natural sciences. We will also discuss the use of\nstorytelling, explorations and experimenting, puzzles and creative problem\nsolving etc., to make learning interesting for students. It is important to\nshow students that the `true' essence of mathematics goes beyond the dry\nprocedural drill of learning arithmetic. Students must be provided with the\nopportunities to experience the `aha moment' resulting from the joy of solving\na difficult problem, or from the understanding of a deep concept with complete\nclarity.

We assume that the topology of\nthe social network is prescribed while the influence probabilities among edges\nare unknown. In order to learn the influence probabilities and simultaneously\nmaximize the influence spread, we consider the tradeoff between exploiting the\ncurrent estimation of the influence probabilities to ensure certain influence\nspread and exploring more nodes to learn better about the influence\nprobabilities. The exploitation-exploration trade-off is the core issue in the\nmulti-armed bandit (MAB) problem. If we regard the influence spread as the\nreward, then the IM problem could be reduced to the combinatorial multi-armed\nbandits. At each round, the learner selects a limited number of seed nodes in\nthe social network, then the influence spreads over the network according to\nthe real influence probabilities. The learner could observe the activation\nstatus of the edge if and only if its start node is influenced, which is\nreferred to as the edge-level semi-bandit feedback. Two classical bandit\nalgorithms including Thompson Sampling and Epsilon Greedy are used to solve\nthis combinatorial problem. To ensure the robustness of these two algorithms,\nwe use an automatic ensemble learning strategy, which combines the exploration\nstrategy with exploitation strategy.

Observations reveal that presence of\nsolvated ions leads to modulated evaporation kinetics, which is further a\nfunction of surface wettability. On hydrophilic surfaces, increasing salt\nconcentration leads to enhanced evaporation rates, whereas on superhydrophobic\nsurfaces, it first enhances and reduces with concentration. Also, the nature\nand extents of the evaporation regimes constant contact angle or constant\ncontact radius are dependent on the salt concentration. The reduced evaporation\non superhydrophobic surfaces has been explained based on observed via\nmicroscopy crystal nucleation behaviour within the droplet. Purely diffusion\ndriven evaporation models are noted to be unable to predict the modulated\nevaporation rates. Further, the changes in the surface tension and static\ncontact angles due to solvated salts also cannot explain the improved\nevaporation behaviour. Internal advection is observed using PIV to be generated\nwithin the droplet and is dependent on the salt concentration. The advection\ndynamics has been used to explain and quantify the improved evaporation\nbehaviour by appealing to the concept of interfacial shear modified Stefan\nflows around the evaporating droplet.

To\nlet our face anti-spoofing model generalize well to unseen attacks, the\nproposed framework trains our model to perform well in the simulated domain\nshift scenarios, which is achieved by finding generalized learning directions\nin the meta-learning process.

This enables our model more likely to find generalized\nlearning directions with the regularized meta-learning for face anti-spoofing\ntask. Besides, to further enhance the generalization ability of our model, the\nproposed framework adopts a fine-grained learning strategy that simultaneously\nconducts meta-learning in a variety of domain shift scenarios in each\niteration.

In this paper, we propose two novel\ntechniques in the generative adversarial networks to produce photo-realistic\nimages for image super-resolution. Firstly, instead of producing a single score\nto discriminate images between real and fake, we propose a variant, called\nFine-grained Attention Generative Adversarial Network for image\nsuper-resolution (FASRGAN), to discriminate each pixel between real and fake.\nFASRGAN adopts a Unet-like network as the discriminator with two outputs: an\nimage score and an image score map. The score map has the same spatial size as\nthe HR/SR images, serving as the fine-grained attention to represent the degree\nof reconstruction difficulty for each pixel.

From a probabilistic\nperspective, PCA seeks a low-dimensional representation of data in the presence\nof independent identical Gaussian noise. Probabilistic PCA (PPCA) and its\nvariants have been extensively studied for decades. Most of them assume the\nunderlying noise follows a certain independent identical distribution. However,\nthe noise in the real world is usually complicated and structured. To address\nthis challenge, some variants of PCA for data with non-IID noise have been\nproposed. However, most of the existing methods only assume that the noise is\ncorrelated in the feature space while there may exist two-way structured noise.\nTo this end, we propose a powerful and intuitive PCA method (MN-PCA) through\nmodeling the graphical noise by the matrix normal distribution, which enables\nus to explore the structure of noise in both the feature space and the sample\nspace. MN-PCA obtains a low-rank representation of data and the structure of\nnoise simultaneously. And it can be explained as approximating data over the\ngeneralized Mahalanobis distance.

Previous theoretical work using nonspatial models has\nfocussed on the development of an understanding of coexistence mechanisms\nthrough the consideration of resource niche separation and ecosystem\ndisturbances. In this paper, we propose that a spatial self-organisation\nprinciple, caused by a positive feedback between local vegetation growth and\nwater redistribution, is sufficient for species coexistence in savanna\necosystems.

In our learning paradigm,\npairwise potentials are created as the dot product of a learned vector w with\npositive feature vectors. In order to constrain such a model to remain\ntractable, previous approaches have enforced the weight vector to be positive\nfor pairwise potentials in which the labels differ, and set pairwise potentials\nto zero in the case that the label remains the same. Such constraints are\nsufficient to guarantee that the resulting pairwise potentials satisfy the\nsubmodularity inequality.

Guaranteeing submodularity for\nall possible inputs, no matter how improbable, reduces inference error to\neffectively zero, but increases model error. In contrast, we relax the\nrequirement of guaranteed submodularity to solutions that are probably\napproximately submodular.

The generated model is fully differentiable and can be combined with\nthe feature extraction in a single pipeline enabling further end-to-end\nprocessing. Experiments on several real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate\noutstanding performance in terms of scalability, accuracy, and learning with\nvery few training examples. Compared to state-of-the-art mappings, we\nsignificantly reduce the network size while achieving the same or even improved\naccuracy due to better generalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 11:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

We assume a two-level generative process\nwith a continuous (Gaussian) latent variable sampled conditionally on a\ndiscrete (categorical) latent component. The new variational objective\nnaturally couples the learning of the posterior and prior conditionals, and the\nlearning of the latent categories encoding the multimodality of the original\ndata in an unsupervised manner. The data-dependent conditional priors are then\nused to sample the continuous latent code when generating new samples from the\nindividual mixture components corresponding to the multimodal structure of the\noriginal data.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate driver awareness, use, perceived safety, knowledge, training, and\nattitudes toward ADAS with different automation systems/features. Results of\nour online survey (n=1018) reveal that there is a significant difference in\nfrequency of use and perceived safety for different ADAS features. Furthermore,\nwe find that at least 70% of drivers activate an ADAS feature \"most or all of\nthe time\" when driving, yet we find that at least 40% of drivers report feeling\nthat ADAS often compromises their safety when activated. We also find that most\nrespondents learn how to use ADAS in their vehicles by trying it out on the\nroad by themselves, rather than through any formal driver education and\ntraining. These results may mirror how certain ADAS features are often\nactivated by default resulting in high usage rates. These results also suggest\na lack of driver training and education for safely interacting with, and\noperating, ADAS, such as turning off systems/features. These findings\ncontribute to a critical discussion about the overall safety implications of\ncurrent ADAS, especially as they enable higher-level automation features to\ncreep into personal vehicles without a lockstep response in training,\nregulation, and policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 13:55:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2020 13:48:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 20:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

Velocity or intensity swirls have now been shown to be widely\npresent throughout the photosphere and chromosphere.

The automated swirl detection algorithm (ASDA) is applied\nto the photospheric horizontal velocity and vertical magnetic fields obtained\nfrom a series of realistic numerical simulations using the RMHD code Bifrost.\nThe spatial relationship between the detected velocity and magnetic swirls is\nfurther investigated via a well-defined correlation index (CI) study.

The change of in-plane distances implies that\nbonds weaker than covalent or ionic ones are at work within the monolayers\nthemselves. This observation is relevant for the prediction of the critical\ntemperature $T_c$. (b) There is a hierarchy of independent parameters that\nuniquely define a ground state ferroelectric unit cell (and square and\nrectangular paraelectric unit cells as well): only 5 optimizable parameters are\nneeded to establish the unit cell vectors and the four basis vectors of the\nferroelectric ground state unit cell, while square and rectangular paraelectric\nstructures are defined by only 3 or 2 independent optimizable variables,\nrespectively. (c) The reduced number of independent structural variables\ncorrelates with larger elastic energy barriers on a rectangular paraelectric\nunit cell when compared to the elastic energy barrier of a square paraelectric\nstructure. This implies that $T_c$ obtained on a structure that keeps the\nlattice parameters fixed (for example, using an NVT ensemble) should be larger\nthan the transition temperature on a structure that is allowed to change\nin-plane lattice vectors (for example, using the NPT ensemble). (d) The\ndissociation energy (bulk cleavage energy) of these materials is similar to the\nenergy required to exfoliate graphite and MoS$_2$. (e) There exists a linear\nrelation among the square paraelectric unit cell lattice parameter and the\nlattice parameters of the rectangular ferroelectric ground state unit cell.\nThese results highlight the subtle atomistic structure of these novel 2D\nferroelectrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 14:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

Our NIR\nobservations confirm the previous claim that the circumprimary and\ncircumsecondary disks are misaligned from each other. Both the circumprimary\nand circumsecondary disks show similar structures in $^{12}$CO observations in\nterms of its size and elongation direction. This consistency is because both\nNIR and $^{12}$CO are tracing surface layers of the flared disks.

In some semi-arid regions, the climate is\ncharacterised by seasonality, which yields a synchronisation of seed dispersal\nwith the dry season or the beginning of the wet season. We reformulate the\nKlausmeier model, a reaction-advection-diffusion system that describes the\nplant-water dynamics in semi-arid environments, as an integrodifference model\nto account for the temporal separation of plant growth processes during the wet\nseason and seed dispersal processes during the dry season. The model further\naccounts for nonlocal processes involved in the dispersal of seeds. Our\nanalysis focusses on the onset of spatial patterns. The Klausmeier partial\ndifferential equations (PDE) model is linked to the integrodifference model in\nan appropriate limit, which yields a control parameter for the temporal\nseparation of seed dispersal events. We find that the conditions for pattern\nonset in the integrodifference model are equivalent to those for the continuous\nPDE model and hence independent of the time between seed dispersal events. We\nthus conclude that in the context of seed dispersal, a PDE model provides a\nsufficiently accurate description, even if the environment is seasonal. This\nemphasises the validity of results that have previously been obtained for the\nPDE model. Further, we numerically investigate the effects of changes to seed\ndispersal behaviour on the onset of patterns.

These PDEs will be of the form $\\partial$t$\\rho$ --\n$\\Delta$$\\rho$ -- $\\nabla$ $\\times$ ($\\rho$$\\nabla$u[$\\rho$]) = 0, complemented\nwith no-flux boundary conditions and an intial condition on $\\rho$0. We will in\nparticular concentrate on the Fokker-Plack case, where u[$\\rho$] = V and V is a\nfixed function (with possible regularity assumptions) independent of $\\rho$, on\nthe case where u[$\\rho$] = W * $\\rho$ is obtained by convolution and models\ninteraction between particles, and on the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel case\nwhere u[$\\rho$] is related to $\\rho$ via an elliptic equation. This last case\nmodels the evolution of a biological population $\\rho$ subject to diffusion but\nattracted by the concentration of a chemo-attractant, a nutrient which is\nproduced by the population itself, so that its distribution is ruled by a PDE\nwhere the density $\\rho$ appears as a source term. Under the assumption that\nthe production rate of this nutrient is much faster than the motion of the\ncells, we can assume that its distribution is ruled by a statical PDE with no\nexplicit time-dependence, and gives rise to a system which is a gradient flow\nin the variable $\\rho$ (the parabolic-parabolic case, where the time scale for\nthe cells and for the nutrient are comparable, is also a gradient flow, in the\nproduct space W2 x L 2 , but we will not consider this case). Since we mainly\nconcentrate on the case of bounded domains, in the Keller-Segel case the term\nu[$\\rho$] cannot be expressed as a convoluton and requires ad-hoc computations.\nIn all the paper, the estimates will be studied on a time-discretized version\nof these PDEs, consisting in the so-called JKO (Jordan-Kinderleherer-Otto)\nscheme, based on iterated optimization problems involving the Wasserstein\ndistance W2.

The experimental\nresults on Korean-to-Chinese translation demonstrate that the models with the\nproposed method improve translation quality up to 1.5 BLEU points in comparison\nto the baseline models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 15:55:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

However, these\nearly fusion methods may not fully exploit the unique temporal patterns of each\nview in complicated time series. Moreover, the label correlations of multiple\nviews, which are critical to boost-ing, are usually under-explored for the\nMVTSC problem. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Correlative\nChannel-Aware Fusion (C2AF) network.

However, when the hash functions change, the binary codes for\nthe database have to be recomputed to guarantee the retrieval accuracy.\nRecomputing the binary codes by accumulating the whole database brings a\ntimeliness challenge to the online retrieval process. In this paper, we propose\na novel online hashing framework to update the binary codes efficiently without\naccumulating the whole database. In our framework, the hash functions are fixed\nand the projection functions are introduced to learn online from the streaming\ndata.

Furthermore, the deep structure and large model size will make\nDNNs prohibitive to embedded systems and IoT devices, where low power\nconsumption are required. To address these challenges, spin orbit torque\nmagnetic random-access memory (SOT-MRAM) and SOT-MRAM based\nProcessing-In-Memory (PIM) engines have been used to reduce the power\nconsumption of DNNs since SOT-MRAM has the characteristic of near-zero standby\npower, high density, none-volatile. However, the drawbacks of SOT-MRAM based\nPIM engines such as high writing latency and requiring low bit-width data\ndecrease its popularity as a favorable energy efficient DNN accelerator. To\nmitigate these drawbacks, we propose an ultra energy efficient framework by\nusing model compression techniques including weight pruning and quantization\nfrom the software level considering the architecture of SOT-MRAM PIM. And we\nincorporate the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) into the\ntraining phase to further guarantee the solution feasibility and satisfy\nSOT-MRAM hardware constraints. Thus, the footprint and power consumption of\nSOT-MRAM PIM can be reduced, while increasing the overall system throughput at\nthe meantime, making our proposed ADMM-based SOT-MRAM PIM more energy\nefficiency and suitable for embedded systems or IoT devices.
