This is true for vesicles in intracellular\ntransport, micro-organisms like bacteria, or animals moving within and\nresponding to their environment. For example, in cells the movement of\nvesicles, organelles and other cargo are affected by their binding to and\nunbinding from cytoskeletal filaments such as microtubules through molecular\nmotor proteins. A typical goal of theoretical or numerical analysis of models\nof such systems is to investigate the effective transport properties and their\ndependence on model parameters. While the effective velocity of particles\nundergoing switching diffusion is often easily characterized in terms of the\nlong-time fraction of time that particles spend in each state, the calculation\nof the effective diffusivity is more complicated because it cannot be expressed\nsimply in terms of a statistical average of the particle transport state at one\nmoment of time. However, it is common that these systems are regenerative, in\nthe sense that they can be decomposed into independent cycles marked by returns\nto a base state. Using decompositions of this kind, we calculate effective\ntransport properties by computing the moments of the dynamics within each cycle\nand then applying renewal-reward theory. This method provides a useful\nalternative large-time analysis to direct homogenization for linear\nadvection-reaction-diffusion partial differential equation models. Moreover, it\napplies to a general class of semi-Markov processes and certain stochastic\ndifferential equations that arise in models of intracellular transport.\nApplications of the proposed framework are illustrated for case studies such as\nmRNA transport in developing oocytes and processive cargo movement by teams of\nmotor proteins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 16:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

In\nsuch games, the players' utility functions cannot be described analytically, as\nthey are given through a black-box simulator that can be queried to obtain\nnoisy estimates of the utilities. This is the case in many real-world games in\nwhich a complete description of the elements involved is not available upfront,\nsuch as complex military settings and online auctions. In these situations, one\nusually needs to run costly simulation processes to get an accurate estimate of\nthe game outcome. As a result, solving these games begets the challenge of\ndesigning learning algorithms that can find (approximate) equilibria with high\nconfidence, using as few simulator queries as possible. Moreover, since running\nthe simulator during the game is unfeasible, the algorithms must first perform\na pure exploration learning phase and, then, use the (approximate) equilibrium\nlearned this way to play the game. In this work, we focus on two-player\nzero-sum games with infinite strategy spaces.

The cause for these disparities\nis not known. Aims: As one step in the effort to resolve this discrepancy, we\naim to characterize the multi-ridge fitting code for ring-diagram helioseismic\nanalysis that is used to obtain flow estimates from local power spectra of\nsolar oscillations. Methods: We updated the multi-ridge fitting code developed\nby Greer et al.(2014) to solve several problems we identified through our\ninspection of the code. In particular, we changed the merit function to account\nfor the smoothing of the power spectra, model for the power spectrum, and noise\nestimates. We used Monte Carlo simulations to generate synthetic data and to\ncharacterize the noise and bias of the updated code by fitting these synthetic\ndata. Results: The bias in the output fit parameters, apart from the parameter\ndescribing the amplitude of the p-mode resonances in the power spectrum, is\nbelow what can be measured from the Monte-Carlo simulations. The amplitude\nparameters are underestimated; this is a consequence of choosing to fit the\nlogarithm of the averaged power. We defer fixing this problem as it is well\nunderstood and not significant for measuring flows in the solar interior. The\nscatter in the fit parameters from the Monte-Carlo simulations is well-modeled\nby the formal error estimates from the code. Conclusions: We document and\ndemonstrate a reliable multi-ridge fitting method for ring-diagram analysis.\nThe differences between the updated fitting results and the original results\nare less than one order of magnitude and therefore we suspect that the changes\nwill not eliminate the aforementioned orders-of-magnitude discrepancy in the\namplitude of convective flows in the solar interior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 17:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

Our central\ncontribution is proving a longstanding conjecture that the Consistency of Local\nDensity Matrices (CLDM) problem is QMA-hard under Karp reductions. The input of\nCLDM consists of local reduced density matrices on sets of at most k qubits,\nand the problem asks if there is an n-qubit global quantum state that is\nconsistent with all of the k-qubit local density matrices. The containment of\nthis problem in QMA and the QMA-hardness under Turing reductions were proved by\nLiu [APPROX-RANDOM 2006].

Bloch simulations incorporated relaxation effects ($T_1,T_2$),\nproton density ($PD$), receiver phase ($\\phi_0$), transmit field inhomogeneity\n($B_1^+$), and slice profile. Parameter maps were compared with those obtained\nfrom dictionary matching, where the parameter resolution was chosen to obtain\nsimilar signal (interpolation) accuracy. For both the phantom and the in-vivo\nacquisition, the proposed method approximated the parameter maps obtained\nthrough dictionary matching while reducing the parameter resolution in each\ndimension ($T_1,T_2,B_1^+$) by, on average, an order of magnitude. In effect,\nthe applied dictionary was reduced from 1.47 GB to 464 KB. Dictionary fitting\nwith B-spline interpolation reduces the computational and memory costs of\ndictionary-based methods and is therefore a promising method for\nmulti-parametric mapping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 17:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

In this problem, it is generally\nassumed that the computational cost for evaluating a point is large; thus, it\nis important to search efficiently with as low budget as possible. Bayesian\noptimization is an efficient method for black-box optimization and provides\nexploration-exploitation trade-off by constructing a surrogate model that\nconsiders uncertainty of the objective function. However, because Bayesian\noptimization should construct the surrogate model for the entire search space,\nit does not exhibit good performance when points are not sampled sufficiently.\nIn this study, we develop a heuristic method refining the search space for\nBayesian optimization when the available evaluation budget is low. The proposed\nmethod refines a promising region by dividing the original region so that\nBayesian optimization can be executed with the promising region as the initial\nsearch space. We confirm that Bayesian optimization with the proposed method\noutperforms Bayesian optimization alone and shows equal or better performance\nto two search-space division algorithms through experiments on the benchmark\nfunctions and the hyperparameter optimization of machine learning algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 17:43:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 05:36:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 2019 15:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

Here, we explore the\nlocalization properties of waves in a novel family of quasiperiodic chains\nobtained when continuously interpolating between two paradigmatic limits: the\nAubry-Andr\\'e model, famous for its metal-to-insulator transition, and the\nFibonacci chain, known for its critical nature. Using both theoretical analysis\nand experiments on cavity-polariton devices, we discover that the Aubry-Andr\\'e\nmodel evolves into criticality through a cascade of band-selective\nlocalization/delocalization transitions that iteratively shape the self-similar\ncritical wavefunctions of the Fibonacci chain. Our findings offer (i) a unique\nnew insight into understanding the criticality of quasiperiodic chains, (ii) a\ncontrollable knob by which to engineer band-selective pass filters, and (iii) a\nversatile experimental platform with which to further study the interplay of\nmany-body interactions and dissipation in a wide range of quasiperiodic models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 18:18:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

While the proposed methods perform well on\nstandard benchmarks, they often fail to produce convincing results in\nreal-world settings. This is because real-world images can be subject to\ncorruptions such as sensor noise, which are severely altered by bicubic\ndownscaling. Therefore, the models never see a real-world image during\ntraining, which limits their generalization capabilities. Moreover, it is\ncumbersome to collect paired LR and HR images in the same source domain.\n  To address this problem, we propose DSGAN to introduce natural image\ncharacteristics in bicubically downscaled images.

From our\nsimulations, we see emergence of galactic-scale magnetised outflows, carrying\ngas from the disk. We compare the morphology of the outflowing gas with\nhydrodynamic (HD) simulations. We look at the spatial distribution of magnetic\nfield in the outflows. Assuming that a certain fraction of gas energy density\nis converted into cosmic ray energy density, and using information about the\nmagnetic field, we obtain synchrotron emissivity throughout the simulation\ndomain. We generate the surface brightness maps at a frequency of 1.4 GHz. The\noutflows are more extended in the vertical direction than radial and hence have\nan oblate shape. We further find that the matter right behind the outer shock,\nshines brighter in these maps than that above or below. To understand whether\nthis feature can be observed, we produce vertical intensity profiles. We\nconvolve the vertical intensity profile with the typical beam sizes of radio\ntelescopes, for a galaxy located at 10 Mpc (similar to NGC 891) in order to\nestimate the radio scale height to compare with observations. We find that for\nour SFRs this feature will lie below the RMS noise limit of instruments. The\nradio scale height is found to be $\\sim 300-1200$ pc , depending on the\nresolution of the telescope. We relate the advection speed of the outer shock\nwith the surface density of star formation as $\\rm{v}_{\\rm adv} \\propto\n\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}^{0.3}$ which is consistent with earlier observations and\nanalytical estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 19:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Both observations and simulations indicate that the material within\nseveral kpc of galactic disk mid-planes consists of warm clouds embedded within\na hot wind. A theoretical understanding of the outflow phenomenon, including\nboth winds and fountain flows, requires study of the interactions among thermal\nphases. We develop a method to quantify these interactions via measurements of\nmass, momentum, and energy flux exchanges using temporally and spatially\naveraged quantities and conservation laws. We apply this method to a\nstar-forming ISM MHD simulation based on the TIGRESS framework, for Solar\nneighbourhood conditions. To evaluate the extent of interactions among the\nphases, we first examine the validity of the ``ballistic model,'' which\npredicts trajectories of the warm phase ($5050\\,\\rm{K}<T<2\\times10^4\\,\\rm{K}$)\ntreated as non-interacting clouds. This model is successful at intermediate\nvertical velocities ($ 50$ km s$^{-1}$ $\\lesssim |v_z| \\lesssim 100 $ km\ns$^{-1}$), but at higher velocities we observe an excess in simulated warm\noutflow compared to the ballistic model.

By examining the fluxes of\nmass, momentum and energy, we conclude that warm phase gains mass via cooling\nof the intermediate phase, while momentum transfer occurs from the hot\n($T>5\\times10^5\\,\\rm{K}$) to the warm phase. The large energy flux from the hot\noutflow that is transferred to the warm and intermediate phases is quickly\nradiated away. A simple interaction model implies an effective warm cloud size\nin the fountain flow of a few 100~pc, showing that warm-hot flux exchange\nmainly involves a few large clouds rather than many small ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 19:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

A few\nlaboratory experiments have demonstrated that wind can change wave shape, and\ntwo-phase numerical simulations have also noted wind-induced wave shape\nchanges. However, wind's effect on wave shape is poorly understood, and no\ntheory for it exists.

While this result agrees\nwith existing analyses of the QCD axion, for more general ALPs that can feature\nan enhanced photon coupling, stability is only ensured by a combination of the\nexpansion and the plasma effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 19:22:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 17:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

While these\nissues pose a bottleneck for the use of such models in aerospace design,\ncomputational costs can be significantly minimized by constructing special,\nstructure-preserving surrogate models called reduced-order models. Such models\nare known to incur huge off-line costs, however, which can sometimes outweigh\ntheir potential benefits.

In this paper, we utilize the semantic information learned by sound\nclassifier networks trained on a vast amount of diverse sounds to improve\nuniversal sound separation. In particular, we show that semantic embeddings\nextracted from a sound classifier can be used to condition a separation\nnetwork, providing it with useful additional information.

Despite a great amount of efforts devoted to understanding the\nbehavior of tracking algorithms, reliable and quantifiable ways for studying\nthe per factor tracking behavior remain barely available. Addressing this\nissue, in this paper we contribute to the community a tracking diagnosis\ntoolkit, TracKlinic, for diagnosis of challenge factors of tracking algorithms.\n  TracKlinic consists of two novel components focusing on the data and analysis\naspects, respectively. For the data component, we carefully prepare a set of\n2,390 annotated videos, each involving one and only one major challenge factor.\nWhen analyzing an algorithm for a specific challenge factor, such\none-factor-per-sequence rule greatly inhibits the disturbance from other\nfactors and consequently leads to more faithful analysis. For the analysis\ncomponent, given the tracking results on all sequences, it investigates the\nbehavior of the tracker under each individual factor and generates the report\nautomatically. With TracKlinic, a thorough study is conducted on ten\nstate-of-the-art trackers on nine challenge factors (including two compound\nones). The results suggest that, heavy shape variation and occlusion are the\ntwo most challenging factors faced by most trackers. Besides, out-of-view,\nthough does not happen frequently, is often fatal. By sharing TracKlinic, we\nexpect to make it much easier for diagnosing tracking algorithms, and to thus\nfacilitate developing better ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 21:15:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 20:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

First, for the\ncorresponding Cauchy problem, when shear and bulk viscosity coefficients are\nboth given as a constant multiple of the density's power ($\\rho^\\delta$ with\n$0<\\delta<1$), based on some elaborate analysis of this system's intrinsic\nsingular structures, we show that the $L^\\infty$ norm of the deformation tensor\n$D(u)$ and the $L^6$ norm of $\\nabla \\rho^{\\delta-1}$ control the possible\nbreakdown of regular solutions with far field vacuum. This conclusion means\nthat if a solution with far field vacuum of the \\textbf{ICND} system is\ninitially regular and loses its regularity at some later time, then the\nformation of singularity must be caused by losing the bound of $D(u)$ or\n$\\nabla \\rho^{\\delta-1}$ as the critical time approaches.

This is because these protocols seem to suffer from a\nsharp performance decay. More specifically, as the size of a deployment---i.e.,\ndegree of replication---increases, the protocol performance greatly decreases.\nThere is not much experimental evidence for this decay in practice, however,\nnotably for larger system sizes, e.g., beyond a handful of machines.\n  In this paper we execute agreement protocols on up to 100 machines and\nobserve on their performance decay. We consider well-known agreement protocols\npart of mature systems, such as Apache ZooKeeper, etcd, and BFT-Smart, as well\nas a chain and a novel ring-based agreement protocol which we implement\nourselves.\n  We provide empirical evidence that current agreement protocols execute\ngracefully on 100 machines. We observe that throughput decay is initially sharp\n(consistent with previous observations); but intriguingly---as each system\ngrows beyond a few tens of replicas---the decay dampens. For chain- and\nring-based replication, this decay is slower than for the other systems. The\npositive takeaway from our evaluation is that mature agreement protocol\nimplementations can sustain out-of-the-box 300 to 500 requests per second when\nexecuting on 100 replicas on a wide-area public cloud platform.

Benchmarking is a key step in this\nprocess but has been hampered in part due to the lack of representative and\nup-to-date benchmarking suites. This is exacerbated by the fast-evolving pace\nof DL models.\n  This paper proposes DLBricks, a composable benchmark generation design that\nreduces the effort of developing, maintaining, and running DL benchmarks on\nCPUs. DLBricks decomposes DL models into a set of unique runnable networks and\nconstructs the original model's performance using the performance of the\ngenerated benchmarks. DLBricks leverages two key observations: DL layers are\nthe performance building blocks of DL models and layers are extensively\nrepeated within and across DL models. Since benchmarks are generated\nautomatically and the benchmarking time is minimized, DLBricks can keep\nup-to-date with the latest proposed models, relieving the pressure of selecting\nrepresentative DL models. Moreover, DLBricks allows users to represent\nproprietary models within benchmark suites. We evaluate DLBricks using $50$\nMXNet models spanning $5$ DL tasks on $4$ representative CPU systems. We show\nthat DLBricks provides an accurate performance estimate for the DL models and\nreduces the benchmarking time across systems (e.g. within $95\\%$ accuracy and\nup to $4.4\\times$ benchmarking time speedup on Amazon EC2 c5.xlarge).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 21:42:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 15:51:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 16:51:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

Several groups\nhave developed metrics that provide a quantitative comparison between\nrepresentations computed by networks and representations measured in cortex. At\nthe same time, neuroscience is well into an unprecedented phase of large-scale\ndata collection, as evidenced by projects such as the Allen Brain Observatory.\nDespite the magnitude of these efforts, in a given experiment only a fraction\nof units are recorded, limiting the information available about the cortical\nrepresentation.

The codes for this system are called rack-aware regenerating codes.\nSimilar to standard minimum storage regenerating (MSR) codes, it is a\nchallenging task to construct minimum storage rack-aware regenerating (MSRR)\ncodes achieving the cut-set bound. The known constructions of MSRR codes\nachieving the cut-set bound give codes with alphabet size $q$ exponential in\nthe code length $n$, more precisely, $q=\\Omega(\\exp(n^n))$.\n  The main contribution of this paper is to provide explicit construction of\nMSRR codes achieving the cut-set bound with the alphabet size linear in $n$.

Because the cross-sectional retina has distinct features\nin OCT and OCTA B-scans, existing digital filters that can denoise OCT\nefficiently are unable to handle the bulk-motion noise in OCTA. In this Letter,\nwe propose a universal digital filtering approach that is capable of minimizing\nboth types of noise. Considering the retinal capillaries in OCTA are hard to\ndifferentiate in B-scans while having distinct curvilinear structures in 3D\nvolumes, we decompose the volumetric OCT and OCTA data with 3D shearlets thus\nefficiently separate the retinal tissue and vessels from the noise in this\ntransform domain. Compared with wavelets and curvelets, the shearlets provide\nbetter representation of the layer edges in OCT and the vasculature in OCTA.\nQualitative and quantitative results show the proposed method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art OCT and OCTA denoising methods. Besides, the superiority of 3D\ndenoising is demonstrated by comparing the 3D shearlet filtering with its 2D\ncounterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 02:56:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 01:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

The idea relies on the simple approach of binning, but\novercomes the two key limitations of binning: zero gradients for the flat\nregions almost everywhere, and lost precision -- reduced discrimination -- due\nto coarse aggregation. We introduce a Fuzzy Tiling Activation (FTA) that\nprovides non-negligible gradients and produces overlap between bins that\nimproves discrimination.

We name the fixed-point network\nobtained through such integrated conversion as Integrated Fixed-point\nQuantization Networks (IFQ-Net). We demonstrate that our IFQNet gives 2.16x and\n18x more savings on model size and runtime feature map memory respectively with\nsimilar accuracy on ImageNet. Furthermore, based on YOLOv2, we design\nIFQ-Tinier-YOLO face detector which is a fixed-point network with 256x\nreduction in model size (246k Bytes) than Tiny-YOLO. We illustrate the\npromising performance of our face detector in terms of detection rate on Face\nDetection Data Set and Bencmark (FDDB) and qualitative results of detecting\nsmall faces of Wider Face dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 03:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

To strike a balance\nbetween the reduced transmission cost and the cost incurred by the delay, a\nscheduling algorithm determining either to transmit an uncoded packet or to\nwait for coding is needed. Because of highly uncertain traffic injections,\nscheduling with no assumption of the traffic is critical.

The expected total cost (including a\ntransmission cost and a delay cost) incurred by the proposed algorithm is at\nmost e/(e-1) ~ 1.58 times the minimum achievable total cost. In particular, the\nproposed algorithm is universal in the sense that the ratio is independent of\nthe traffic.

The problem is further\ncomplicated when the coverage range becomes irregular due to site-specific\nblockage (e.g., buildings) on the air-ground channel in the 3-dimensional (3D)\nspace. To tackle this challenging problem, this paper applies the Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) method by 1) representing the state by a coverage\nbitmap to capture the spatial correlation of GUs/ABSs, whose dimension and\nassociated neural network complexity is invariant with arbitrarily large N; and\n2) designing the action and reward for the DRL agent to effectively learn from\nthe dynamic interactions with the complicated propagation environment\nrepresented by a 3D Terrain Map.

The double\ndeep Q-network (DQN) with Prioritized Experience Replay (Prioritized Replay\nDDQN) algorithm is applied to train the policy of multi-ABS placement decision.\nNumerical results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the\ncoverage rate in complex environment, compared to the benchmark DQN and K-means\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 06:35:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 07:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-06"}

Methods: We used a TR-FOCI adiabatic pulse for spin inversion in a\nT2-FLAIR sequence to improve B1+ homogeneity and calculate the pulse power\nrequired for adiabaticity slice-by-slice to minimize the SAR. Drawing on the\nimplicit B1+ inhomogeneity present in a standard localizer scan, 3D AutoAlign\nlocalizers and SA2RAGE B1+ maps were acquired in eight volunteers. A\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) was then trained to predict the B1+ profile\nfrom the localizers and scale factors for the pulse power for each slice were\ncalculated. The ability to predict the B1+ profile as well as how the derived\npulse scale factors affected the FLAIR inversion efficiency were assessed in\ntransverse, sagittal, and coronal orientations. Results: The predicted B1+ maps\nmatched the measured B1+ maps with a mean difference of 4.45% across all\nslices.

It is known that\nwhile the Copeland rule and related rules guarantee distortion at most 5, many\nother standard voting rules, such as Plurality, Veto, or $k$-approval, have\ndistortion growing unboundedly in the number $n$ of candidates.\n  Plurality, Veto, or $k$-approval with small $k$ require less communication\nfrom the voters than all deterministic social choice rules known to achieve\nconstant distortion. This motivates our study of the tradeoff between the\ndistortion and the amount of communication in deterministic social choice\nrules.\n  We show that any one-round deterministic voting mechanism in which each voter\ncommunicates only the candidates she ranks in a given set of $k$ positions must\nhave distortion at least $\\frac{2n-k}{k}$; we give a mechanism achieving an\nupper bound of $O(n/k)$, which matches the lower bound up to a constant.

So\nfar, the conversion of LTLf formulas to deterministic finite-state automata\n(DFAs) has been identified as the primary bottleneck to the scalabity of\nsynthesis. Recent investigations have also shown that the size of the DFA state\nspace plays a critical role in synthesis as well.\n  Therefore, effective resolution of the bottleneck for synthesis requires the\nconversion to be time and memory performant, and prevent state-space explosion.\nCurrent conversion approaches, however, which are based either on\nexplicit-state representation or symbolic-state representation, fail to address\nthese necessities adequately at scale: Explicit-state approaches generate\nminimal DFA but are slow due to expensive DFA minimization. Symbolic-state\nrepresentations can be succinct, but due to the lack of DFA minimization they\ngenerate such large state spaces that even their symbolic representations\ncannot compensate for the blow-up.\n  This work proposes a hybrid representation approach for the conversion.

In cognitive\nneuroscience, for instance, brain connectomes base the analysis of coactivation\npatterns between different brain regions on the analysis of the correlations of\ntheir functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) time series - an object thus\nconstrained by construction to belong to the manifold of symmetric positive\ndefinite matrices. One of the challenges that naturally arises consists of\nfinding a lower-dimensional subspace for representing such manifold-valued\ndata. Traditional techniques, like principal component analysis, are\nill-adapted to tackle non-Euclidean spaces and may fail to achieve a\nlower-dimensional representation of the data - thus potentially pointing to the\nabsence of lower-dimensional representation of the data. However, these\ntechniques are restricted in that: (i) they do not leverage the assumption that\nthe connectomes belong on a pre-specified manifold, therefore discarding\ninformation; (ii) they can only fit a linear subspace to the data. In this\npaper, we are interested in variants to learn potentially highly curved\nsubmanifolds of manifold-valued data. Motivated by the brain connectomes\nexample, we investigate a latent variable generative model, which has the added\nbenefit of providing us with uncertainty estimates - a crucial quantity in the\nmedical applications we are considering. While latent variable models have been\nproposed to learn linear and nonlinear spaces for Euclidean data, or geodesic\nsubspaces for manifold data, no intrinsic latent variable model exists to learn\nnongeodesic subspaces for manifold data. This paper fills this gap and\nformulates a Riemannian variational autoencoder with an intrinsic generative\nmodel of manifold-valued data. We evaluate its performances on synthetic and\nreal datasets by introducing the formalism of weighted Riemannian submanifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 08:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

In the Gaussian\nchannels, the classic one-way protocol requires Eve's channel to be degraded\nw.r.t. Bob's channel. However, this channel degradation condition depends on\nEve's location and whether Eve's receiving antenna is more powerful than Bob's.\nTo overcome this limitation, we introduce a two-way protocol inspired in IEEE\nTIT (1993) that eliminates the channel degradation condition.\n  In the proposed two-way protocol, on a first phase, via Gaussian channel, Bob\nsends randomness to Alice, which is partially leaked to Eve.

To fully\nutilize the potential of the vast amount of existing image enhancement\ntechniques, the corresponding information from both modalities must be present\nin the same domain. For image-guided interventional procedures, X-ray\nfluoroscopy has proven to be the modality of choice. Synthesizing one modality\nfrom another in this case is an ill-posed problem due to ambiguous signal and\noverlapping structures in projective geometry. To take on these challenges, we\npresent a learning-based solution to MR to X-ray projection-to-projection\ntranslation. We propose an image generator network that focuses on high\nrepresentation capacity in higher resolution layers to allow for accurate\nsynthesis of fine details in the projection images. Additionally, a weighting\nscheme in the loss computation that favors high-frequency structures is\nproposed to focus on the important details and contours in projection imaging.\nThe proposed extensions prove valuable in generating X-ray projection images\nwith natural appearance. Our approach achieves a deviation from the ground\ntruth of only $6$% and structural similarity measure of $0.913\\,\\pm\\,0.005$. In\nparticular the high frequency weighting assists in generating projection images\nwith sharp appearance and reduces erroneously synthesized fine details.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 09:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

Observations and reanalyses show\na clear pattern of co-variability between Arctic sea ice and Eurasian\nwintertime temperatures.

As a novel mechanism, the simultaneous occurrence of\nthe hyperbolic and gyromagnetic effects in these metamaterials is shown to open\nthe large topological band gaps with gap Chern number of one. Importantly,\nunlike many other photonic Chern insulators, the GHM Chern insulators possess\nnon-radiative chiral edge modes on their surfaces, and thus allow to fabricate\nunidirectional waveguides without cladding metals which generally incurr\nconsiderable Ohmic loss. Furthermore, the photonic edge states in the proposed\nChern insulators are robust against disorder on a wide range of length scales,\nin strong contrast to crystalline topological insulators, and the light flow\ndirection on the surface of the Chern insulators can be easily flipped by\nswitching the direction of an applied magnetic field.

In molecular photoionization, these\nbarriers prevent the electron from escaping instantaneously, so that nuclei may\nmove and modify the potential, thereby affecting the ionization process. By\nusing an attosecond two-color interferometric approach in combination with high\nspectral resolution, we have captured the changes induced by the nuclear motion\non the centrifugal barrier that sustains the well-known shape resonance in\nvalence-ionized N$_2$. We show that despite the nuclear motion altering the\nbond length by only $2\\%$, which leads to tiny changes in the potential\nbarrier, the corresponding change in the ionization time can be as large as\n$200$ attoseconds. This result poses limits to the concept of instantaneous\nelectronic transitions in molecules, which is at the basis of the Franck-Condon\nprinciple of molecular spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 09:54:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 15:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-14"}

Decentralisation, however,\nappears difficult to be formally defined, possibly a continuum property of\nsystems that can be more or less decentralised, or can tend to decentralisation\nin their lifetime. In this paper we focus on decentralisation in quorum-based\napproaches to open (permissionless) consensus as illustrated in influential\nprotocols such as the Ripple and Stellar protocols. Drawing from game theory\nand computational complexity, we establish limiting results concerning the\ndecentralisation vs. safety trade-off in Ripple and Stellar, and we propose a\nnovel methodology to formalise and quantitatively analyse decentralisation in\nthis type of blockchains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 10:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

This work brings\ninto question some common modeling and control design choices that are\ntypically adopted to guarantee robustness and reliability but which may\nseverely limit the attainable performance. Unlike most of state of the art\nworks, the proposed method takes advantages of a unified nonlinear model which\naims to describe the whole robot dynamics by explicitly including a realistic\nphysical description of the actuator dynamics and limitations. As a matter of\nfact, our solution does not resort to common simplifications such as: 1) linear\nmodel approximation, 2) cascaded control paradigm used to decouple the\ntranslational and the rotational dynamics of the rigid body, 3) use of\nlow-level reactive trackers for the stabilization of the internal loop, and 4)\nunconstrained optimization resolution or use of fictitious constraints. More in\ndetail, we consider as control inputs the derivatives of the propeller forces\nand propose a novel method to suitably identify the actuator limitations by\nleveraging experimental data. Differently from previous approaches, the\nconstraints of the optimization problem are defined only by the real physics of\nthe actuators, avoiding conservative -- and often not physical -- input/state\nsaturations which are present, e.g., in cascaded approaches. The control\nalgorithm is implemented using a state-of-the-art Real Time Iteration (RTI)\nscheme with partial sensitivity update method.

We study such\nintermittent behavior of chaotic orbits in three-dimensional volume-preserving\nsystems using the example of the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress map. The map has a\nmixed phase space with a cylindrical regular region surrounded by a chaotic sea\nfor the considered parameters. We observe a characteristic overall power-law\ndecay of the cumulative Poincar\\'e recurrence statistics with significant\noscillations superimposed. This slow decay is caused by orbits which spend long\ntimes close to the surface of the regular region. Representing such\nlong-trapped orbits in frequency space shows clear signatures of partial\nbarriers and reveals that coupled resonances play an essential role. Using a\nsmall number of the most relevant resonances allows for classifying\nlong-trapped orbits. From this the Poincar\\'e recurrence statistics can be\ndivided into different exponentially decaying contributions which very\naccurately explains the overall power-law behavior including the oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 11:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

This\nsystem is of special interest in the field of quantum information processing\n(QIP) and can be realized in electron spin states in quantum dots or Rydberg\natoms in optical cavities and superconducting qubits in linear resonators. We\npresent an exact analytical solution for the time evolution of the system\nstarting from any initial state. Utilizing this solution, we show how the\nentanglement sudden death (ESD), which represents a major threat to QIP, can be\nefficiently controlled by tuning atom-atom coupling and non-zero detuning. We\ndemonstrate that while one of these two system parameters may not separately\naffect the ESD, combining the two can be very effective, as in the case of an\ninitial correlated Bell state. However in other cases, such as a W-like initial\nstate, they may have a competing impacts on ESD. Moreover, their combined\neffect can be used to create ESD in the system as in the case of an\nanti-correlated initial Bell state. A clear synchronization between the\npopulation inversion collapse-revival pattern and the entanglement dynamics is\nobserved at all system parameter combinations. Nevertheless, only for initial\nstates that may evolve to ESD, the population inversion revival oscillations,\nwhere exchange of energy between the atoms and the field takes place,\ntemporally coincide with the entanglement revival peaks, whereas the population\ncollapse periods match the ESD intervals. The variation of the radiation field\nintensity has a clear impact on the duration of the ESD at any combination of\nthe other system parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 11:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

Recently, a tension with the flat {\\Lambda}CDM\nmodel has been discovered using a high-redshift Hubble diagram of supernovae,\nquasars, and gamma-ray bursts. Here we use the Union2 type Ia supernovae (SNIa)\nand Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) Hubble diagram, and a set of direct measurements of\nthe Hubble parameter to explore different dark energy models.

The quality of\nthese signals can be deteriorated by ionospheric scintillation which can have\ndetrimental effects on the mentioned applications. Therefore, monitoring of\nionospheric scintillation and quantifying its effect on the ground are of\nsignificant interest. In this work, we develop a methodology which estimates\nthe scintillation induced ionospheric uncertainties in the sky and translates\ntheir impact to the end-users on the ground. First, by using the risk concept\nfrom decision theory and by exploiting the intensity and duration of\nscintillation events (as measured by the S4 index), we estimate ionospheric\nrisk maps that could readily give an initial impression on the effects of\nscintillation on the satellite-receiver communication. However, to better\nunderstand the influence of scintillation on the positioning accuracy on the\nground, we formulate a new weighted dilution of precision (WPDOP) measure that\nincorporates the ionospheric scintillation risks as weighting factors for the\ngiven satellite-receiver constellations. These weights depend implicitly on\nscintillation intensity and duration thresholds which can be specified by the\nend-user based on the sensitivity of the application, for example. We\ndemonstrate our methodology by using scintillation data from South America, and\nproduce ionospheric risk maps which illustrate broad scintillation activity,\nespecially at the equatorial anomaly. Moreover, we construct ground maps of\nWPDOP over a grid of hypothetical receivers which reveal that ionospheric\nscintillation can also affect such regions of the continent that are not\nexactly under the observed ionospheric scintillation structures.

Our analysis indicates that Cialdini`s\nmarketing-based social persuasion strategies, such as liking, appeal to\nauthority, and the need for commitment and consistency are extensively\nimplemented by rental scammers. Of Stajano and Wilson's scam-based persuasion\nstrategies, an appeal to sympathy (i.e., kindness) and need for greed were\ncommonly used.

By comparing our analytic and numerical results, it is also\nconfirmed that the fraction of the reflected ions hardly depends on the plasma\nbeta and the Alfven Mach number when the square of the Alfven Mach number\ndivided by the plasma beta is larger than about 20.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 13:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

Our application focuses on the detection of\nAlzheimer's disease with gray matter probability maps extracted from structural\nMRI. We first assessed the robustness of the visualization method by studying\nthe coherence of the longitudinal patterns and regions identified by the\nnetwork.

We\ndemonstrated that the areas identified by the CNN were consistent with what is\nknown of Alzheimer's disease and that the visualization approach extract\ncoherent longitudinal patterns. We also showed that the CNN training is not\nstable and that the areas identified mainly depend on the initialization and\nthe training process. This issue may exist in many other medical studies using\ndeep learning methods on datasets in which the number of samples is too small\nand the data dimension is high. This means that it may not be possible to rely\non deep learning to detect stable regions of interest in this field yet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 13:57:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 15:39:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 16:16:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

The eikonal model diverges for Coulomb breakup since it relies\non the adiabatic approximation. To correct this weakness, a Coulomb-corrected\neikonal method (CCE) using the Coulomb first-order-perturbation approximation\nwas developed.\n  Purpose: Since the CCE mixes two reaction models and treats the Coulomb and\nnuclear interactions on different footings, we study here an alternative\napproach. We develop a simplification to the dynamical eikonal approximation\n(S-DEA) which has a similar numerical cost as the usual eikonal model, and\nstudy its efficiency for both nuclear- and Coulomb-dominated breakup reactions.\n  Methods: We compare the energy and parallel-momentum cross sections obtained\nwith the dynamical eikonal approximation, the usual eikonal approximation, the\nCCE and the S-DEA.\n  Results: The S-DEA leads to precise energy distributions for both breakup\nreactions. The corresponding parallel-momentum distributions obtained with the\nS-DEA are improved compared to the ones computed with the eikonal model. It is\nmore efficient for nuclear-dominated breakup than the CCE since it reproduces\nbetter the shape and magnitude of the distribution. However, for the Coulomb\nbreakup, the distribution lacks asymmetry.\n  Conclusions: The simplification of the DEA developed in this work improves\nsignificantly the eikonal descriptions of breakup energy distribution for both\nCoulomb- and nuclear-dominated reactions. The asymmetry of the\nparallel-momentum distribution is enhanced for nuclear-dominated breakup. This\nstudy confirms that the asymmetry is due to dynamical effects.

Recently, IoU loss and generalized IoU (GIoU) loss have been\nproposed to benefit the IoU metric, but still suffer from the problems of slow\nconvergence and inaccurate regression. In this paper, we propose a Distance-IoU\n(DIoU) loss by incorporating the normalized distance between the predicted box\nand the target box, which converges much faster in training than IoU and GIoU\nlosses. Furthermore, this paper summarizes three geometric factors in bounding\nbox regression, \\ie, overlap area, central point distance and aspect ratio,\nbased on which a Complete IoU (CIoU) loss is proposed, thereby leading to\nfaster convergence and better performance. By incorporating DIoU and CIoU\nlosses into state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, e.g., YOLO v3, SSD\nand Faster RCNN, we achieve notable performance gains in terms of not only IoU\nmetric but also GIoU metric. Moreover, DIoU can be easily adopted into\nnon-maximum suppression (NMS) to act as the criterion, further boosting\nperformance improvement.

Unlike pseudo-spectral projection and regression-based\nstochastic collocation methods, the proposed approach results in PCEs featuring\none polynomial term per collocation point. Moreover, the resulting PCEs are\ninterpolating, i.e., they are exact on the interpolation nodes/collocation\npoints. Once available, an interpolating PCE can be used as an inexpensive\nsurrogate model, or be post-processed for the purposes of uncertainty\nquantification and sensitivity analysis. The main idea is conceptually simple\nand relies on the use of Leja sequence points as interpolation nodes. Using\nNewton-like, hierarchical basis polynomials defined upon Leja sequences, a\nsparse-grid interpolation can be derived, the basis polynomials of which are\nunique in terms of their multivariate degrees. A dimension-adaptive scheme can\nbe employed for the construction of an anisotropic interpolation.

Therefore, the in-between steps of hierarchical interpolation\nand basis transform can be discarded altogether, and the interpolating PCE can\nbe computed directly.

(iii) When the mass\ndifference between NLSP and LSP is larger than $m_Z$, most of the samples can\nbe checked at $5\\sigma$ level with future 300 $\\rm fb^{-1}$ data at the LHC.\nWhile with 3000 $\\rm fb^{-1}$ data at the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), nearly\nall of the samples can be checked at $5\\sigma$ level even if the mass\ndifference is insufficient. (iv) The $a_1$ funnel and the $h_2/Z$ funnel\nmechanisms for the singlino-dominated LSP annihilating can not be distinguished\nby searching for NLSPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 14:51:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 17:50:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 15:31:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Three different forebody configurations mounted with\na sharp spike-tip ranging from blunt to streamlined (flat-face, hemispherical,\nand elliptical) are considered. Steady and unsteady pressure measurements,\nshort-exposure high-speed shadowgraphy, shock footprint analysis from $x-t$\nplots, and identification of dominant spatiotemporal modes through modal\nanalysis are carried out to explain the unsteady flow physics. The present\ninvestigation tools are validated against the well-known events of `pulsation'\nassociated with the flat-face case. The hemispherical case is characterized by\nthe formation of a separated free shear layer and associated localized shock\noscillations. The cycle of charging and ejection of fluid mass from the\nrecirculation zone, confined between the separated shear layer and the spiked\nbody, is identified to drive the flow unsteadiness. Such an event triggers the\nout-of-phase motion between the separated and reattachment shocks. In the\nelliptical case, the overall flow field resembles that of the hemispherical\ncase, except with dampened unsteadiness. The value of the cone angle\n($\\lambda$) associated with the recirculation region is found to be responsible\nfor the fluctuations from the charging and ejection of fluid mass. Thereby it\ncontrols the extent of out-of-shock phase motion. In the elliptical case,\n$\\lambda$ is observed to be smaller and exhibits a reduction in shock\nunsteadiness. \\hlt{Based on the gathered results and understanding, the\nreduction in unsteadiness associated with the aerodisk mounted on the\nhemispherical forebody is explained via the almost complete elimination of the\nout-of-phase shock motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 14:59:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 07:30:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 16:48:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

This becomes important\nwhen the line-of-sight direction varies significantly across a survey, leading\nto what are known as `wide angle' effects in redshift space distortions.\nWide-angle effects will also be present in measurements of the momentum field,\ni.e. the galaxy density-weighted velocity field, in upcoming peculiar velocity\nsurveys. In this work we study how wide-angle effects modify the predicted\ncorrelation function and power spectrum for momentum statistics, both in\nauto-correlation and in cross-correlation with the density field. Using both\nlinear theory and the Zeldovich approximation, we find that deviations from the\nplane-parallel limit are large and could become important in data analysis for\nlow redshift surveys.

Experience is shared between both\nagents and their attention mechanisms are aligned. The image-based policy can\nthen be deployed without access to privileged information. We experimentally\ndemonstrate accelerated and more robust learning on a diverse set of domains,\nleading to improved final performance for environments both within and outside\nthe training distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 15:49:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:22:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 14:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

Among these forms of malware, ransomware has\nexperienced a significant recent rise as it offers the perpetrators great\nfinancial incentive. Ransomware variants operate by removing system access from\nthe user by either locking the system or encrypting some or all of the data,\nand subsequently demanding payment or ransom in exchange for returning system\naccess or providing a decryption key to the victim. Due to the ubiquity of\nsensitive data in many aspects of modern life, many victims of such attacks, be\nthey an individual home user or operators of a business, are forced to pay the\nransom to regain access to their data, which in many cases does not happen as\nrenormalisation of system operations is never guaranteed. As the problem of\nransomware does not seem to be subsiding, it is very important to investigate\nthe underlying forces driving and facilitating such attacks in order to create\npreventative measures. As such, in this paper, we discuss and provide further\ninsight into variants of ransomware and their victims in order to understand\nhow and why they have been targeted and what can be done to prevent or mitigate\nthe effects of such attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 15:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

The closing becomes complete for a vanishing\nquantum parameter. We demonstrate that this behavior, reminiscent of a quantum\nphase transition, is associated with a transition from a stationary state which\nis localized in phase space to a delocalized one.

Most deep multimodal learning methods typically\ninvolve two steps to construct the joint representations: 1) learning of\nmultiple intermediate features, with each intermediate feature corresponding to\na modality, using separate and independent deep models; 2) merging the\nintermediate features into a joint representation using a fusion strategy.\nHowever, in the first step, these intermediate features do not have previous\nknowledge of each other and cannot fully exploit the information contained in\nthe other modalities.

The modal-aware\noperation consists of a kernel network and an attention network. The kernel\nnetwork is utilized to learn the non-linear relationships with other\nmodalities.

Extension nodes can be implemented in\neither Python, C++, and Fortran, and combined in the same algorithm. AViS\noffers a comprehensive collection of nodes for sophisticated visualization\nstate modifications, thus greatly simplifying the rules for writing extensions.\nInput files can also be read from the server automatically, and data is fetched\nautomatically to improve memory usage. In addition, the visualization system of\nAViS uses physically-based rendering techniques, improving the 3D perception of\nmolecular structures for interactive visualization. By performing two case\nstudies on complex molecular systems, we show that the DFP workflow offers a\nmuch higher level of flexibility and extensibility when compared to legacy\nworkflows. The software source code and binaries for Windows, MacOS, and Linux\nare freely available at https://avis-md.github.io/.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 08:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

The dense central core structure formed\ninside the WD when heavy CHAMPs sink to its center can trigger a supernova via\ninjection of energy during collapse phases, via direct density-enhanced\n(pycnonuclear) fusion processes of carbon nuclei dragged into the core by the\nCHAMPs, or via the formation of a black hole (BH) at the center of the WD. In\nthe latter scenario, Hawking radiation from the BH can ignite the star if the\nBH forms with a sufficiently small mass; if the BH instead forms at large\nenough mass, heating of carbon nuclei that accrete onto the BH as it grows in\nsize may be able to achieve the same outcome (with the conservative alternative\nbeing simply that the WD is devoured by the BH).

Second, the entropy\ndensity of replica symmetric theory has a transition point at a finite inverse\ntemperature on a regular random graph when the node degree exceeds 4 and on an\nER random graph when the node degree exceeds 6.6; there is no entropy\ntransition point (or $\\beta=\\infty$) in other circumstances. Third, the results\nof the replica symmetry (RS) theory are in perfect agreement with those of\nbelief propagation (BP) algorithm while the results of the belief propagation\ndecimation (BPD) algorithm are better than those of the greedy heuristic\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 03:29:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 07:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-10"}

The ML\nsurrogates are then used to predict the aeroelastic response of the coupled\nsystem. The external aerodynamic loads on the airfoil and the two-phase\nsloshing loads data for training the RNN are generated using open-source\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. The aerodynamic force and moment\ncoefficients are predicted from the surrogate model based on its motion\nhistory. Similarly, the lateral and vertical forces and moments from fuel\nsloshing in the fuel tank are predicted using the surrogate model resulting\nfrom the motion of the embedded fuel tank. Comparing the free motion of the\nairfoil without sloshing tank to the free motion of the airfoil with a\npartially-filled fuel tank shows that the effects of sloshing on the\naeroelastic motion of the aero-structural system. The effectiveness of the\npredictions from RNN are then assessed by comparing with the results from the\nhigh-fidelity coupled aero-structural-fuel tank sloshing simulations.

To alleviate this problem, this brief presents a\nsimple but effective way that improves the performance of generative\nadversarial network (GAN) without imposing the training overhead or modifying\nthe network architectures of existing methods. The proposed method employs a\nnovel cascading rejection (CR) module for discriminator, which extracts\nmultiple non-overlapped features in an iterative manner using the vector\nrejection operation. Since the extracted diverse features prevent the\ndiscriminator from concentrating on non-meaningful features, the discriminator\ncan guide the generator effectively to produce the images that are more similar\nto the real images. In addition, since the proposed CR module requires only a\nfew simple vector operations, it can be readily applied to existing frameworks\nwith marginal training overheads. Quantitative evaluations on various datasets\nincluding CIFAR-10, CelebA, CelebA-HQ, LSUN, and tiny-ImageNet confirm that the\nproposed method significantly improves the performance of GAN and conditional\nGAN in terms of Frechet inception distance (FID) indicating the diversity and\nvisual appearance of the generated images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 10:31:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 03:50:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 10 May 2020 04:33:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 16:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}
