Equivalently, isochrons\ncan be characterized as stable manifolds foliating neighborhoods of the limit\ncycle or as level sets of an isochron map. In recent years, there has been a\nlively discussion in the mathematical physics community on how to define\nisochrons for stochastic oscillations, i.e. limit cycles or heteroclinic cycles\nexposed to stochastic noise. The main discussion has concerned an approach\nfinding stochastic isochrons as sections of equal expected return times versus\nthe idea of considering eigenfunctions of the backward Kolmogorov operator. We\ndiscuss the problem in the framework of random dynamical systems and introduce\na new rigorous definition of stochastic isochrons as random stable manifolds\nfor random periodic solutions with noise-dependent period. This allows us to\nestablish a random version of isochron maps whose level sets coincide with the\nrandom stable manifolds. Finally, we discuss links between the random dynamical\nsystems interpretation and the equal expected return time approach via averaged\nquantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 16:06:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 11:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

Unlike typical outdoor\ntraining dataset, such as KITTI with motion constraints, data for indoor\nenvironment contains more arbitrary camera movement and short baseline between\ntwo consecutive images, which deteriorates the network training for the pose\nestimation. To address this issue, we propose two methods: Firstly, we propose\na novel reconstruction loss function to constraint pose estimation, resulting\nin accuracy improvement of the predicted disparity map; secondly, we use an\nensemble learning with a flipping strategy along with a median filter, directly\ntaking operation on the output disparity map.

Successful coordination\nis supported primarily through shared attention to the musical output; however,\nmusicians also interact visually, particularly when the musical timing is\nirregular. This study investigated the performance conditions that encourage\nvisual signalling and interaction between ensemble members. Piano and clarinet\nduos rehearsed a new piece as their body motion was recorded. Analyses of head\nmovement showed that performers communicated gesturally following held notes.\nGesture patterns became more consistent as duos rehearsed, though consistency\ndropped again during a final performance given under no-visual-contact\nconditions. Movements were smoother and interperformer coordination was\nstronger during irregularly-timed passages than elsewhere in the piece,\nsuggesting heightened visual interaction. Performers moved more after\nrehearsing than before, and more when they could see each other than when\nvisual contact was occluded. Periods of temporal instability and increased\nfamiliarity with the music and co-performer seem to encourage visual\ninteraction, while specific communicative gestures are integrated into\nperformance routines through rehearsal. We propose that visual interaction may\nsupport successful ensemble performance by affirming coordination throughout\nperiods of temporal instability and serving as a social motivator to promote\ncreative risk-taking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 16:46:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

In order to directly compare the Faraday depth\nspectrum with physical properties of a magneto-ionic medium, we generated\nsynthetic broad-bandwidth spectro-polarimetric observations from\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a transonic, isothermal, compressible\nturbulent medium. We find that correlated magnetic field structures give rise\nto a combination of spiky, localized peaks at certain FD values, and broad\nstructures in the FD spectrum. Although the majority of these spiky FD\nstructures appear narrow, giving an impression of a Faraday thin medium, we\nshow that they arise from strong synchrotron emissivity at that FD. Strong\nemissivity at a FD can arise because of both strong spatially-local polarized\nsynchrotron emissivity at a FD or accumulation of weaker emissions along the\ndistance through a medium that have Faraday depths within half the width of the\nrotation measure spread function. Such a complex Faraday depth spectrum is a\nnatural consequence of MHD turbulence when the lines of sight pass through a\nfew turbulent cells. This therefore complicates the convention of attributing\nnarrow FD peaks to presence of a Faraday rotating medium along the line of\nsight. Our work shows that it is difficult to extract the FD along a line of\nsight from the Faraday depth spectrum using standard methods for a turbulent\nmedium in which synchrotron emission and Faraday rotation occur simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 16:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

However, few works have\nfocused on representing trips over public transportation networks (buses,\nsubway, and trains) where a user's trips can be seen as a sequence of stages\nperformed within a vehicle shared with many other users. In this context,\nrepresenting vehicle journeys reduces the redundancy because all the passengers\ninside a vehicle share the same arrival time for each stop. In addition, each\nvehicle journey follows exactly the sequence of stops corresponding to its\nline, which makes it unnecessary to represent that sequence for each journey.\n  To solve data management for transportation systems, we designed a conceptual\nmodel that gave us a better insight into this data domain and allowed us the\ndefinition of relevant terms and the detection of redundancy sources among\nthose data. Then, we designed two compact representations focused on users'\ntrips (TTCTR) and on vehicle trips (AcumM), respectively. Each approach owns\nsome strengths and is able to answer some queries efficiently.\n  We include experimental results over synthetic trips generated from accurate\nschedules obtained from a real network description (from the bus transportation\nsystem of Madrid) to show the space/time trade-off of both approaches. We\nconsidered a wide range of different queries about the use of the\ntransportation network such as counting-based or aggregate queries regarding\nthe load of any line of the network at different times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 17:18:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

Since the lane markings are on the road area and any feature point\nabove the ground will be a noise source for the lane detection, a mask is\ncreated for the road area to remove some of the noise for lane detection. The\nestimated mask is multiplied by the lane feature map in a bird's eye view\n(BEV). The lane feature points are extracted by using an extended version of\nsymmetrical local threshold (SLT), which not only considers dark light dark\ntransition (DLD) of the lane markings, like (SLT), but also considers\nparallelism on the lane marking borders. The segmentation then uses only the\nfeature points that are on the road area. A maximum of two linear lane markings\nare detected using an efficient 1D Hough transform. Then, the detected linear\nlane markings are used to create a region of interest (ROI) for parabolic lane\ndetection. Finally, based on the estimated region of interest, parabolic lane\nmodels are fitted using robust fitting. Due to the robust lane feature\nextraction and road area segmentation, the proposed algorithm robustly detects\nlane markings and achieves lane marking detection with an accuracy of 91% when\ntested on a sequence from the KITTI dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 17:34:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

This is in particular prevalent in\ninterdisciplinary research where the theoretical aspects are sometimes\novershadowed by the challenges of the application. To show-case these\nundesirable impacts, we conduct a series of experiments on a recently created\nbenchmark data, named Space Weather ANalytics for Solar Flares (SWAN-SF).

We illustrate how failing to notice this concept\ncould give an artificial boost in the forecast performance and result in\nmisleading findings.

We propose an Attention Gated Hierarchical\nMemory Network (AGHMN) to address the problems of prior work: (1) Commonly used\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) for utterance feature extraction are less\ncompatible in the memory modules; (2) Unidirectional gated recurrent units\n(GRUs) only allow each historical utterance to have context before it,\npreventing information propagation in the opposite direction; (3) The Soft\nAttention for summarizing loses the positional and ordering information of\nmemories, regardless of how the memory bank is built. Particularly, we propose\na Hierarchical Memory Network (HMN) with a bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) as the\nutterance reader and a BiGRU fusion layer for the interaction between\nhistorical utterances. For memory summarizing, we propose an Attention GRU\n(AGRU) where we utilize the attention weights to update the internal state of\nGRU. We further promote the AGRU to a bidirectional variant (BiAGRU) to balance\nthe contextual information from recent memories and that from distant memories.\nWe conduct experiments on two emotion conversation datasets with extensive\nanalysis, demonstrating the efficacy of our AGHMN models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 18:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

EQShapelets are\namplitude and phase-independent, i.e., their detection sensitivity is\nirrespective of the magnitude of the earthquake and the time of occurrence.\nThey are also robust to noise and other spurious signals. The detection\ncapability of EQShapelets is tested on one week of continuous seismic data\nprovided by the Northern California Seismic Network (NCSN) obtained from a\nstation in central California near the Calaveras Fault.

The proposed methodology relies\non an accurate calculation of target occurrence probability distribution based\non the initial estimated target distribution and continuous action of spatial\nvariant search agent sensors. The core of the autonomous search process is a\nhigh-level motion control for multiple search agents which utilizes the\nprobabilistic model of target occurrence via Heat Equation Driven Area Coverage\n(HEDAC) method. This centralized motion control algorithm is tailored for\nhandling a group of search agents which are heterogeneous in both motion and\nsensing characteristics. The motion of agents is directed by the gradient of\nthe potential field which provides near-ergodic exploration of the search\nspace. The proposed method is tested on three realistic search mission\nsimulations and compared with three alternative methods, where HEDAC\noutperforms all alternatives in all tests. Conventional search strategies need\nabout double the time to achieve proportionate detection rate when compared to\nHEDAC controlled search. The scalability test showed that increasing the number\nof HEDAC controlled search agents, although somewhat deteriorating the search\nefficiency, provides needed speed-up of the search.

Crafted as such, the neural network can also provide\ncorrections for erroneously represented physics, such as discretization errors\nassociated with the PDE's numerical solution. Once trained, the deep learning\nPDE model (DPM) can make out-of-sample predictions for new physical parameters,\ngeometries, and boundary conditions.\n  Our approach optimizes over the functional form of the PDE. Estimating the\nembedded neural network requires optimizing over the entire PDE, which itself\nis a function of the neural network.

We present here a semi-analytic model,\nsimultaneously addressing both problems in a comprehensive evolutionary\nframework for Fornax.

Many studies have considered building a stronger IV from\nthe original, possibly weak, IV in the design stage of a matched study at the\ncost of not using some of the samples in the analysis. It is widely accepted\nthat strengthening an IV tends to render nonparametric tests more powerful and\nwill increase the power of sensitivity analyses in large samples. In this\narticle, we re-evaluate this conventional wisdom to bring new insights into\nthis topic. We consider matched observational studies from three perspectives.\nFirst, we evaluate the trade-off between IV strength and sample size on\nnonparametric tests assuming the IV is valid and exhibit conditions under which\nstrengthening an IV increases power and conversely conditions under which it\ndecreases power. Second, we derive a necessary condition for a valid\nsensitivity analysis model with continuous doses. We show that the $\\Gamma$\nsensitivity analysis model, which has been previously used to come to the\nconclusion that strengthening an IV increases the power of sensitivity analyses\nin large samples, does not apply to the continuous IV setting and thus this\npreviously reached conclusion may be invalid. Third, we quantify the bias of\nthe Wald estimator with a possibly invalid IV under an oracle and leverage it\nto develop a valid sensitivity analysis framework; under this framework, we\nshow that strengthening an IV may amplify or mitigate the bias of the\nestimator, and may or may not increase the power of sensitivity analyses.

This problem is\nthus the counterpart of the well-studied problem of applying compressed CNNs to\nuncompressed images, which has attracted great interest as CNNs are deployed to\nsize-, weight-, and power- (SWaP)-limited devices. We introduce Localized\nCompression, a generalization of downgrading in which the original image is\ndivided into blocks and each block is compressed to a smaller size using either\nsampling- or random-matrix-based techniques. By aligning the size of the\ncompressed blocks with the size of the CNN's convolutional region, localized\ncompression can be made compatible with any CNN architecture. Our experimental\nresults show that Localized Compression results in classification accuracy\napproximately 1-2% higher than is achieved by downgrading to the equivalent\nresolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 21:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-22"}

The challenges, such as clustering, occlusion, and\nadhesion problems of the objects, make instance segmentation a non-trivial\ntask. Current box-free instance segmentation methods typically rely on local\npixel-level information. Due to a lack of global object view, these methods are\nprone to over- or under-segmentation. On the contrary, the box-based instance\nsegmentation methods incorporate object detection into the segmentation,\nperforming better in identifying the individual instances. In this paper, we\npropose a new box-based instance segmentation method. Mainly, we locate the\nobject bounding boxes from their center points. The object features are\nsubsequently reused in the segmentation branch as a guide to separate the\nclustered instances within an RoI patch. Along with the instance normalization,\nthe model is able to recover the target object distribution and suppress the\ndistribution of neighboring attached objects. Consequently, the proposed model\nperforms excellently in segmenting the clustered objects while retaining the\ntarget object details. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformances on three biological datasets: cell nuclei, plant phenotyping\ndataset, and neural cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 22:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-22"}

Previous works mostly utilize single face image as a\nsource, and generate novel facial animations by merging other person's facial\nfeatures. However, some facial regions like eyes or teeth, which may be hidden\nin the source image, can not be synthesized faithfully and stably. In this\npaper, We present a landmark driven two-stream network to generate faithful\ntalking facial animation, in which more facial details are created, preserved\nand transferred from multiple source images instead of a single one.\nSpecifically, we propose a network consisting of a learning and fetching\nstream.

Effects of additives, such\nas fatty alcohols, cocamide monoethanolamine (CMEA) and salt, which are\nexpected to boost the growth of wormlike micelles, are studied. We report and\nsystematize the most significant observed effects with an emphasis on the\ninterpretation at molecular level and understanding the rheological behavior of\nthese systems. The experiments show that the mixing of SME and CAPB produces a\nsignificant rise of viscosity, which is greater than in the mixed solutions of\nsodium dodecyl sulfate and CAPB. The addition of fatty alcohols, CMEA and\ncationic polymer, leads to broadening of the synergistic peak in viscosity\nwithout any pronounced effect on its height. The addition of NaCl leads to a\ntypical salt curve with high maximum, but in the presence of dodecanol this\nmaximum is much lower. At lower salt concentrations, the fatty alcohol acts as\na thickener, whereas at higher salt concentrations - as a thinning agent.\nDepending on the shape of the frequency dependences of the measured storage and\nloss moduli, the investigated micellar solutions behave as systems of standard\nor nonstandard rheological behavior. The systems with standard behavior obey\nthe Maxwell viscoelastic model (at least) up to the crossover point and can be\nanalyzed in terms of the Cates reptation-reaction model. The systems with\nnonstandard rheological behavior obey the Maxwell model only in a restricted\ndomain below the crossover frequency; they can be analyzed in the framework of\nan augmented version of the Maxwell model. The methodology for data analysis\nand interpretation could be applied to any other viscoelastic micellar system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 08:19:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

The problem can be\ndefined as voice-face matching and retrieval tasks. Much research attention has\nbeen paid on these tasks recently. However, this research is still in the early\nstage. Test schemes based on random tuple mining tend to have low test\nconfidence. Generalization ability of models can not be evaluated by small\nscale datasets. Performance metrics on various tasks are scarce. A benchmark\nfor this problem needs to be established. In this paper, first, a framework\nbased on comprehensive studies is proposed for voice-face matching and\nretrieval.

For example, apps must properly acquire, use, and\nrelease microphones, cameras, and other multimedia devices otherwise the\nbehavior of the apps that use the same resources might be compromised.\nUnfortunately, several apps do not use resources correctly, for instance due to\nfaults and inaccurate design decisions. By interacting with these apps users\nmay experience unexpected behaviors, which in turn may cause instability and\nsporadic failures, especially when resources are accessed. In this paper, we\npresent an approach that lets users protect their environment from the apps\nthat use resources improperly by enforcing the correct usage protocol.

The main idea is that software libraries, in particular the ones\ncontrolling access to resources, can be augmented with enforcers that can be\nactivated and deactivated on demand by users to protect their environment from\nunwanted app behaviors.

The certification of relevant quantum properties follows\nfrom the observation of correlations between these events that do not have a\nclassical counterpart. In the fully device-independent scenario no assumptions\nare made on the devices and therefore their non-classicality follows from Bell\nnon-locality. There exist other scenarios, known as semidevice-independent, in\nwhich assumptions are made on the devices, such as their dimension, and\nnon-classicality is associated to the observation of other types of\ncorrelations with no classical analogue.

Their magneto-static and dynamic behavior is\nsimilar to that of single crystalline bulk YIG. We found, that the Gilbert\ndamping coefficient alpha is independent of the film thickness and close to 1 x\n10-4, and that together with an inhomogeneous peak-to-peak linewidth broadening\nof delta H0|| = 0.4 G, these values are among the lowest ever reported for YIG\nfilms with a thickness smaller than 40 nm.

In our method,\nwe consider fewer cluster maps for analyzing an optimal number of clusters for\nisolating the components of interest in the spatio-temporal ERP. The\nstatistical comparison demonstrates that the present method outperforms other\nconventional approaches. This finding would be practically useful for\ndiscovering the optimal clustering in spatio-temporal ERP, especially when the\ncognitive knowledge about time-window is not clearly defined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 11:16:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-22"}

Compared with\nthe black-box attack on images, attacking videos is more challenging as the\ncomputation cost for searching the adversarial perturbations on a video is much\nhigher due to its high dimensionality. To overcome this challenge, we propose a\nheuristic black-box attack model that generates adversarial perturbations only\non the selected frames and regions. More specifically, a heuristic-based\nalgorithm is proposed to measure the importance of each frame in the video\ntowards generating the adversarial examples. Based on the frames' importance,\nthe proposed algorithm heuristically searches a subset of frames where the\ngenerated adversarial example has strong adversarial attack ability while keeps\nthe perturbations lower than the given bound. Besides, to further boost the\nattack efficiency, we propose to generate the perturbations only on the salient\nregions of the selected frames. In this way, the generated perturbations are\nsparse in both temporal and spatial domains. Experimental results of attacking\ntwo mainstream video recognition methods on the UCF-101 dataset and the HMDB-51\ndataset demonstrate that the proposed heuristic black-box adversarial attack\nmethod can significantly reduce the computation cost and lead to more than 28\\%\nreduction in query numbers for the untargeted attack on both datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 13:04:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-22"}

For the single-player setting,\nwe design an Observe-Before-Play Upper Confidence Bound (OBP-UCB) algorithm for\n$K$ arms with Bernoulli rewards, and prove a $T$-round regret upper bound\n$O(K^2\\log T)$.

Passenger vehicle maneuverability is significantly\naffected by the combined-slip friction effect, in which larger longitudinal\ntire slips result in considerable drop in lateral tire forces. This is of\nhigher importance when unexpected dangerous situations occur on the road and\nimmediate actions, such as braking, need to be taken to avoid collision. Harsh\nbraking can lead to high-slip and loss of maneuverability, hence, timely\nbraking is essential to reduce high-slip scenarios. In addition to the vehicles\nown active safety systems, the proposed event-triggered add-on safety is\nactivated upon being informed about dangers by the road-side infrastructure.\nThe aim is to incorporate the add-on safety feature to adjust the automatic\ncontrol parameters for smooth and timely braking such that a collision is\navoided while vehicle's maneuverability is maintained. We study two different\nwireless technologies for communication between the infrastructure and the\nvehicles, the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and the fifth generation (5G) schemes.\nThe framework is validated through high-fidelity software simulations and the\nadvantages of including the add-on feature to augment the safety margins for\neach communication technology is evaluated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 13:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-22"}

Among\nthe various approaches, artificial neural networks (NNs) are one promising tool\nto learn a representation of potential energy surfaces. This is done by\nformulating the problem as a mapping from a set of atomic positions\n$\\mathbf{x}$ and nuclear charges $Z_i$ to a potential energy $V(\\mathbf{x})$.\nHere, a fully-dimensional, reactive neural network representation for\nmalonaldehyde (MA), acetoacetaldehyde (AAA) and acetylacetone (AcAc) is\nlearned. It is used to run finite-temperature molecular dynamics simulations,\nand to determine the infrared spectra and the hydrogen transfer rates for the\nthree molecules. The finite-temperature infrared spectrum for MA based on the\nNN learned on MP2 reference data provides a realistic representation of the\nlow-frequency modes and the H-transfer band whereas the CH vibrations are\nsomewhat too high in frequency. For AAA it is demonstrated that the IR\nspectroscopy is sensitive to the position of the transferring hydrogen at\neither the OCH- or OCCH$_3$ end of the molecule. For the hydrogen transfer\nrates it is demonstrated that the O-O vibration is a gating mode and largely\ndetermines the rate at which the hydrogen is transferred between the donor and\nacceptor.

Our goal is to emphasize the relevance of the notion of strong\nFrobenius structure, clasically studied in the theory of the p-adic\ndiffenrential equations, for the study of a Adamczewski-Delaygue's conjecture\nconcerning of the degree of algebraicity modulo p of G-functions. For this, we\nfirst make a Christol's result explicit by showing that if $f$ is a G-function\nthat is solution of a differential operator $L$ in $ \\mathbb{Q}(z)[d/dz]$ of\norder $n$ endowed of a strong Frobenius structure of period $h$ for the prime\nnumber $p$ and that $f(z)$ belongs to $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}[[z]]$, then the\nreduction of $f$ modulo $ p $ is algebraic over $\\mathbb F_p(z)$ and its\nalgebraicity degree is bounded by $p^{n^2h}$. By generalizing an approach\nintroduced by Salinier, we show that if $L$ is a Fuchsian operator with\ncoefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(z)$, whose monodromy group is rigid and whose\nexponents are rational numbers, then $L$ has for almost every prime number $p$\na strong Frobenius structure of period $h$, where $h$ is explicitly bounded and\ndoes not depend on $p$. A slightly different version of this result has been\nrecently demonstrated by Crew following a different approach based on the $p$\n-adic cohomology. We use these two results to solve the mentioned conjecture in\nthe case of generalized hypergeometric series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:27:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 16:35:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 15:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

Automatically extracting CPIs described in biomedical\nliterature is essential for drug discovery, precision medicine, as well as\nbasic biomedical research. Most existing methods focus only on the sentence\nsequence to identify these CPIs. However, the local structure of sentences and\nexternal biomedical knowledge also contain valuable information. Effective use\nof such information may improve the performance of CPI extraction. Results: In\nthis paper, we propose a novel neural network-based approach to improve CPI\nextraction. Specifically, the approach first employs BERT to generate\nhigh-quality contextual representations of the title sequence, instance\nsequence, and knowledge sequence. Then, the Gaussian probability distribution\nis introduced to capture the local structure of the instance. Meanwhile, the\nattention mechanism is applied to fuse the title information and biomedical\nknowledge, respectively. Finally, the related representations are concatenated\nand fed into the softmax function to extract CPIs. We evaluate our proposed\nmodel on the CHEMPROT corpus. Our proposed model is superior in performance as\ncompared with other state-of-the-art models. The experimental results show that\nthe Gaussian probability distribution and external knowledge are complementary\nto each other. Integrating them can effectively improve the CPI extraction\nperformance. Furthermore, the Gaussian probability distribution can effectively\nimprove the extraction performance of sentences with overlapping relations in\nbiomedical relation extraction tasks.

At\nthe level of individual search, animals like moths have developed effective\nstrategies to solve this very difficult navigation problem based on the noisy\ndetection of odor concentration and wind velocity alone.\n  When many individuals concurrently perform the same olfactory search task,\nwithout any centralized control, sharing information about the decisions made\nby the members of the group can potentially increase the performance. But how\nmuch of this information is actually valuable and exploitable for the\ncollective task ? Here we show that, in a model of a swarm of agents inspired\nby moth behavior, there is an optimal way to blend the private information\nabout odor and wind detections with the publicly available information about\nother agents' heading direction. At optimality, the time required for the first\nagent to reach the source is essentially the shortest flight time from the\ndeparture point to the target. Conversely, agents who discard public\ninformation are several fold slower and groups that do not put enough weight on\nprivate information perform even worse. Our results then suggest an efficient\nmulti-agent olfactory search algorithm that could prove useful in robotics, for\ninstance in the identification of sources of harmful volatile compounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:44:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Machine learning-based approaches typically perform this task by\nfirst estimating behavior based on cues within an observation window, such as a\nfixed number of words, and then aggregating the behavior over all the windows\nin that interaction. The length of this window directly impacts the accuracy of\nestimation by controlling the amount of information being used. The exact link\nbetween window length and accuracy, however, has not been well studied,\nespecially in spoken language. In this paper, we investigate this link and\npresent an analysis framework that determines appropriate window lengths for\nthe task of behavior estimation. Our proposed framework utilizes a two-pronged\nevaluation approach: (a) extrinsic similarity between machine predictions and\nhuman expert annotations, and (b) intrinsic consistency between intra-machine\nand intra-human behavior relations. We apply our analysis to real-life\nconversations that are annotated for a large and diverse set of behavior codes\nand examine the relation between the nature of a behavior and how long it\nshould be observed. We find that behaviors describing negative and positive\naffect can be accurately estimated from short to medium-length expressions\nwhereas behaviors related to problem-solving and dysphoria require much longer\nobservations and are difficult to quantify from language alone. These findings\nare found to be generally consistent across different behavior modeling\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:05:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 03:39:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 23:47:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}

FWI is a local optimisation problem which aims to\nminimise in a least-squares sense the misfit between recorded and modelled\ndata. The inversion process begins with a best-guess initial model which is\niteratively improved using a sequence of linearised local inversions to solve a\nfully non-linear problem. Deep learning has gained widespread popularity in the\nnew millennium. At the core of these tools are Neural Networks (NN), in\nparticular Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are variants of these original NN\nalgorithms with significantly more hidden layers, resulting in efficient\nlearning of a non-linear functional between input and output pairs. The\nlearning process within DNN involves iteratively updating network neuron\nweights to best approximate input-to-output mappings. There is clearly\nsimilarity between FWI and DNN.

For applications where only the magnitude of the\nacceleration vector is of interest, the algorithm is straightforward,\ncomputationally efficient and does not require computation of angular velocity\nor orientation. When both the magnitude and direction of acceleration are of\ninterest, the proposed algorithm involves the calculation of the angular\nvelocity and orientation as intermediate steps. In addition to helping\nunderstand the mechanics of mTBI, the AO-algorithm may find widespread use in\nseveral bio-mechanical applications, gyroscope-free inertial navigation units,\nballistic platform guidance, and platform control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:50:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-22"}

Aims: We identify and characterise the stellar\npopulations of the following young giant HII regions: M8, G333.6-0.2, and\nNGC6357. Methods: We acquired H- and K-band spectra of around 200 stars using\nThe K-band KMOS on the ESO Very Large Telescope.

These properties are further confirmed with in situ\nmeasurements much closer to the Sun using Helios observations. We conclude on a\nmodel for the formation of dense blobs and flux ropes that explains both the in\nsitu measurements and the remote-sensing observations presented in our previous\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 12:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

We consider renormalization effects of applied oscillating voltages\ndue to the impedance environment of a single junction as well as its\nimplication to the array.

Success percentages were calculated by dividing\nthe number of correct jumps to the total number of jumps. The results indicated\nthat while the average success percentage for all subjects remained relatively\nstable over the 10 trials (79% +/-7%), success percentages drop relatively as\nthe number of jumps increase. Success rate dropped from 90% (2 jumps) to 70% (7\njumps). We conclude that there is an upper limit of vigilance that should be\nexpected from students when they are exposed to more than 4 randomly occurring\nattention requiring task within a minute.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 12:33:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

However, there exists an ambiguity problem that lots\nof binary codes share the same Hamming distance to a query. To alleviate the\nambiguity problem, weighted binary codes assign different weights to each bit\nof binary codes and compare the binary codes by the weighted Hamming distance.\nTill now, performing the querying from the weighted binary codes efficiently is\nstill an open issue. In this paper, we propose a new method to rank the\nweighted binary codes and return the nearest weighted binary codes of the query\nefficiently. In our method, based on the multi-index hash tables, two\nalgorithms, the table bucket finding algorithm and the table merging algorithm,\nare proposed to select the nearest weighted binary codes of the query in a\nnon-exhaustive and accurate way. The proposed algorithms are justified by\nproving their theoretic properties. The experiments on three large-scale\ndatasets validate both the search efficiency and the search accuracy of our\nmethod. Especially for the number of weighted binary codes up to one billion,\nour method shows a great improvement of more than 1000 times faster than the\nlinear scan.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 06:48:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 02:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-12"}

CBV\nmap is generally accepted to be the best among others to evaluate location and\nsize of stroke lesions and angiogenesis of brain tumors. Its poor accuracy can\ncause failed results for both quantitative measurements and visual assessment\nof cerebral blood volume. The impact of perfusion ROI detection on the quality\nof maps was analyzed through comparison of maps produced from threshold and\nreference images of the same datasets from 12 patients with cerebrovascular\ndisease. Brain perfusion ROI was placed to exclude low intensity (air and\nnon-brain tissues regions) and high intensity (cerebrospinal fluid regions)\npixels. Maps were produced using area under the curve and deconvolution\nmethods. For both methods compared maps were primarily correlational according\nto Pearson correlation analysis: r=0.8752 and r=0.8706 for area under the curve\nand deconvolution, respectively, p<2.2*10^-16. In spite of this, for both\nmethods scatter plots had data points associated with missed blood regions and\nregression lines indicated presence of scale and offset errors for maps\nproduced from threshold images. Obtained results indicate that thresholding is\nan ineffective way to detect brain perfusion ROI, which usage can cause\ndegradation of CBV map quality. Perfusion ROI detection should be standardized\nand accepted into validation protocols of new systems for perfusion data\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 19:46:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-12"}

The recent success of machine learning in speech\nand image recognition has prompted researchers to apply these methods to asset\nprice prediction. The majority of literature has been devoted to predicting\neither the actual asset price or the direction of price movement. In this\npaper, we study a hitherto little explored question of predicting significant\nchanges in stock price based on previous changes using machine learning\nalgorithms. We are particularly interested in the performance of neural network\nclassifiers in the given context. To this end, we construct and test three\nneural network models including multi-layer perceptron, convolutional net, and\nlong short term memory net. As benchmark models we use random forest and\nrelative strength index methods. The models are tested using 10-year daily\nstock price data of four major US public companies. Test results show that\npredicting significant changes in stock price can be accomplished with a high\ndegree of accuracy. In particular, we obtain substantially better results than\nsimilar studies that forecast the direction of price change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 11:48:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

The literature presents several approaches to\nidentifying the emergence of new research topics, which rely on the assumption\nthat the topic is already exhibiting a certain degree of popularity and\nconsistently referred to by a community of researchers. However, detecting the\nemergence of a new research area at an embryonic stage, i.e., before the topic\nhas been consistently labelled by a community of researchers and associated\nwith a number of publications, is still an open challenge. In this\ndissertation, we begin to address this challenge by performing a study of the\ndynamics preceding the creation of new topics. This study indicates that the\nemergence of a new topic is anticipated by a significant increase in the pace\nof collaboration between relevant research areas, which can be seen as the\n'ancestors' of the new topic. Based on this understanding, we developed Augur,\na novel approach to effectively detecting the emergence of new research topics.\nAugur analyses the diachronic relationships between research areas and is able\nto detect clusters of topics that exhibit dynamics correlated with the\nemergence of new research topics. Here we also present the Advanced Clique\nPercolation Method (ACPM), a new community detection algorithm developed\nspecifically for supporting this task. Augur was evaluated on a gold standard\nof 1,408 debutant topics in the 2000-2011 timeframe and outperformed four\nalternative approaches in terms of both precision and recall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 20:20:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-21"}

In\nquantum mechanics, the question of where and when in the Universe an experiment\nis being performed, can only be answered up to the limitations implied by\nHeisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, questioning an assumption made in the\noriginal formulation of the Einstein equivalence principle.
