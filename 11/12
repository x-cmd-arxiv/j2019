Noisy Student Training achieves\n88.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, which is 2.0% better than the\nstate-of-the-art model that requires 3.5B weakly labeled Instagram images. On\nrobustness test sets, it improves ImageNet-A top-1 accuracy from 61.0% to\n83.7%, reduces ImageNet-C mean corruption error from 45.7 to 28.3, and reduces\nImageNet-P mean flip rate from 27.8 to 12.2.\n  Noisy Student Training extends the idea of self-training and distillation\nwith the use of equal-or-larger student models and noise added to the student\nduring learning. On ImageNet, we first train an EfficientNet model on labeled\nimages and use it as a teacher to generate pseudo labels for 300M unlabeled\nimages. We then train a larger EfficientNet as a student model on the\ncombination of labeled and pseudo labeled images. We iterate this process by\nputting back the student as the teacher.

We set out to determine the nature of the TESS planet candidate\nTOI 263.01 using ground-based multicolour transit photometry. The host star is\nfaint, which makes RV confirmation challenging, but the large transit depth\nmakes the candidate suitable for validation through multicolour photometry. Our\nanalysis combines three transits observed simultaneously in r', i', and z_s\nbands using the MuSCAT2 multicolour imager, three LCOGT-observed transit light\ncurves in g, r', and i' bands, a TESS light curve from Sector 3, and a\nlow-resolution spectrum for stellar characterisation observed with the ALFOSC\nspectrograph. We model the light curves with PyTransit using a transit model\nthat includes a physics-based light contamination component that allows us to\nestimate the contamination from unresolved sources from the multicolour\nphotometry. This allows us to derive the true planet-star radius ratio\nmarginalised over the contamination allowed by the photometry, and, combined\nwith the stellar radius, gives us a reliable estimate of the object's absolute\nradius. The ground-based photometry excludes contamination from unresolved\nsources with a significant colour difference to TOI 263. Further, contamination\nfrom sources of same stellar type as the host is constrained to levels where\nthe true radius ratio posterior has a median of 0.217. The median radius ratio\ncorresponds to an absolute planet radius of 0.87 RJup, which confirms the\nsubstellar nature of the planet candidate. The object is either a giant planet\nor a brown dwarf (BD) located deep inside the so-called \"brown dwarf desert\".\nBoth possibilities offer a challenge to current planet/BD formation models and\nmakes 263.01 an object deserving of in-depth follow-up studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 16:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In the case of the SMC, we find highly uniform\nturbulent properties of HI, with no evidence for local enhancements of\nturbulence due to stellar feedback. Such properties could be caused by a\nsignificant turbulent driving on large-scales. Alternatively, a significant\nline-of-sight depth of the SMC could be masking out localized regions with a\nsteeper SPS slope caused by stellar feedback. In contrast to the SMC, the LMC\nHI shows a large diversity in terms of its turbulent properties. Across most of\nthe LMC, the small-scale SPS slope is steeper than the large-scale slope due to\nthe presence of the HI disk. On small spatial scales, we find several areas of\nlocalized steepening of the SPS slope around major HII regions, with the 30\nDoradus region being the most prominent. This is in agreement with predictions\nfrom numerical simulations which suggest steepening of the SPS slope due to\nstellar feedback eroding and destroying interstellar clouds.

Here\nwe show that in CrCl$_3$ multilayers, the dependence of the tunnelling\nconductance on applied magnetic field ($H$), temperature ($T$), and number of\nlayers ($N$) tracks the evolution of the magnetic state, enabling the magnetic\nphase diagram of these systems to be determined experimentally. Besides a\nhigh-field spin-flip transition occurring for all thicknesses, the in-plane\nmagnetoconductance exhibits an even-odd effect due to a low-field spin-flop\ntransition. If the layer number $N$ is even, the transition occurs at $\\mu_0 H\n\\sim 0$ T due to the very small in-plane magnetic anisotropy, whereas for odd\n$N$ the net magnetization of the uncompensated layer causes the transition to\noccur at finite $H$. Through a quantitative analysis of the phenomena, we\ndetermine the interlayer exchange coupling as well as the staggered\nmagnetization, and show that in CrCl$_3$ shape anisotropy dominates.

However, data collected from the wild can be unreliable due to\ncareless annotations or malicious data transformation for incorrect anomaly\ndetection. In this paper, we present a two-layer on-line learning framework for\nrobust anomaly detection (RAD) in the presence of unreliable anomaly labels,\nwhere the first layer is to filter out the suspicious data, and the second\nlayer detects the anomaly patterns from the remaining data. To adapt to the\non-line nature of anomaly detection, we extend RAD with additional features of\nrepetitively cleaning, conflicting opinions of classifiers, and oracle\nknowledge. We on-line learn from the incoming data streams and continuously\ncleanse the data, so as to adapt to the increasing learning capacity from the\nlarger accumulated data set. Moreover, we explore the concept of oracle\nlearning that provides additional information of true labels for difficult data\npoints.

This approach may be\nparticularly problematic when assessing the response patterns of neurons to\nmore than one simultaneously presented stimulus. In such cases, the brain must\nrepresent each individual component of the stimuli bundle, but\ntrial-and-time-pooled averaging methods are fundamentally unequipped to address\nthe means by which multi-item representation occurs. We introduce and\ninvestigate a novel statistical analysis framework that relates the firing\npattern of a single cell, exposed to a stimuli bundle, to the ensemble of its\nfiring patterns under each constituent stimulus. Existing statistical tools\nfocus on what may be called \"first order stochasticity\" in trial-to-trial\nvariation in the form of unstructured noise around a fixed firing rate curve\nassociated with a given stimulus.

We discuss challenges\nto statistical estimation of such \"second order stochasticity\" and address them\nwith a novel dynamic admixture Poisson process (DAPP) model. DAPP is a\nhierarchical point process model that decomposes second order stochasticity\ninto a Gaussian stochastic process and a random vector of interpretable\nfeatures, and, facilitates borrowing of information on the latter across\nrepeated trials through latent clustering.

For\nexample, non-twisted multifilamentary Bi-2223 tapes have been successfully used\nin several magnets. This paper review stability and analyse inductance and AC\nlosses in non-twisted stack of HTS tapes. Numerical calculations show that\ntwisting has negligible effect on inductance variations in a stack of tapes.\nRegarding AC losses, any magnet built with coated conductors have larger losses\nthan LTS ones, because of the aspect ratio and large width of the tape. If a\nwide tape is replaced by a non-twisted stack of narrow tapes, losses and\nresidual magnetisation could be reduced. In contrast with multifilamentary\nwires, twisting a stack of tapes reduces losses only marginally. Therefore,\ncables composed of non-twisted stack could be designed to have losses\ncomparable to the one of twisted stack concepts. Few examples of large cables\nfor fusion applications are discussed.

In February 2018 a series of convective storms\nerupted in Jupiter's South Temperate Belt (STB) (planetocentric latitudes from\n-23$^{\\circ}$ to -29.5$^{\\circ}$). This occurred inside an elongated cyclonic\nregion known popularly as the STB Ghost, close to the large anticyclone Oval\nBA, resulting in the clouds from the storms being confined to the cyclone. The\ninitial storms lasted only a few days but they generated abundant enduring\nturbulence. They also produced dark features, possibly partially devoid of\nclouds, that circulated around the cyclone over the first week. The subsequent\nactivity developed over months and resulted in two main structures, one of them\nclosely interacting with Oval BA and the other one being expelled to the west.\nHere we present a study of this meteorological activity based on daily\nobservations provided by the amateur community, complemented by observations\nobtained from PlanetCam UPV/EHU at Calar Alto Observatory, the Hubble Space\nTelescope and by JunoCam on the Juno spacecraft. We also perform numerical\nsimulations with the EPIC General Circulation Model to reproduce the\nphenomenology observed.

A simple\nscale comparison with other moist convective storms that can be observed in the\nplanet in visible and methane absorption band images strongly suggests that\nmost of these storms are powered by water condensation instead of ammonia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 18:28:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

In this paper we study an\nextension of quasi-single field inflation where the inflaton and the massive\nfield belong to a curved field manifold. Because of the nontrivial field space\ncurvature, the massive field here can get significant mass corrections of order\nthe Hubble scale, thus the quasi-single field predictions on primordial\nnon-Gaussianity are affected. We derive the same result in an equivalent\napproach by using the background effective field theory of inflation, where a\ndimension-6 operator is identified to play an important role and its cutoff\nscale is associated with the curvature scale of the field space. In addition,\ndue to the slow-roll evolution of the inflaton, this type of mass correction\nhas intrinsic time-dependence. Consequently, the running mass modifies the\nscaling behaviour in the squeezed limit of the scalar bispectrum, while the\nresulting running index measures the curvature of the internal field space.\nTherefore the minimal setup of a massive field within curved field space during\ninflation may naturally lead to new observational signatures of the field space\ngeometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 18:56:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 09:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-23"}

In this paper we take a complementary perspective,\nshowing that resource theories of coherence can instead be defined purely\ncompositionally, that is, working with the mathematics of process theories,\nstring diagrams and category theory. This new perspective offers several\nadvantages: i) it unifies various existing approaches to the study of\ncoherence, for example, subsuming both speakable and unspeakable coherence; ii)\nit provides a general treatment of the compositional multi-system setting; iii)\nit generalises immediately to the case of quantum channels, measurements,\ninstruments, and beyond; iv) it can easily be generalised to the setting where\nthere are multiple distinct sources of decoherence; and, iv) it directly\nextends to arbitrary process theories, for example, generalised probabilistic\ntheories and Spekkens toy model--providing the ability to operationally\ncharacterise coherence rather than relying on specific mathematical features of\nquantum theory for its description.

This set of tracers depicts a scenario where the most\nmassive galaxies have, on average, the lowest sSFRs and the oldest stellar\npopulations (age $\\gtrsim1$ Gyr, showing a mass-downsizing effect). We also\nhypothesize that the observed increase in star formation (higher\nEW$_\\mathrm{[OII]|}$, higher sSFR) at intermediate densities may lead to\nquenching since we find the quenched fraction to increase sharply from the\nfilament to cluster-like regions at similar stellar masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 19:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

By comparing the numbers from the two\nsources, we assess which origin is more likely for a hyperbolic object having a\ngiven eccentricity and perihelion distance. We find that the likelihood that a\ngiven hyperbolic object is of interstellar origin increases with decreasing\neccentricity and perihelion.

Through an\ninvestigation of the distances within and clustering of cross-sectional\ncitation networks, this study presents evidence that fields of science become\nmore integrated over time. The average citation distance between papers\npublished in the same year decreased from approximately 5.33 to 3.18 steps\nbetween 1950 and 2018. This observation is attributed to the growth of\ncross-field communication throughout the entire period as well as the growing\nimportance of high impact papers to bridge networks in the same year. Three\nempirical findings support this conclusion. First, distances decreased between\nalmost all disciplines throughout the time period. Second, inequality in the\nnumber of citations received by papers increased, and as a consequence the\nshortest paths in the network depend more on high impact papers later in the\nperiod. Third, the dispersion of connections between fields increased\ncontinually. Moreover, these changes did not entail a lower level of clustering\nof citations. Both within- and cross-field citations show a similar rate of\nslowly growing clustering values in all years.

We provide an analytic expression that relates the\nbaryonic distribution to the change in the DM halo profile. For our galaxy, the\ncontraction increases the enclosed DM halo mass by factors of roughly 1.3, 2\nand 4 at radial distances of 20, 8 and 1 kpc, respectively compared to an\nuncontracted halo. Ignoring this contraction results in systematic biases in\nthe inferred halo mass and concentration.

Several approaches have provided a notion of relaxed\nnoninterference supporting selective and expressive declassification while\nretaining a formal security property. The labels-as-functions approach provides\nrelaxed noninterference by means of declassification policies expressed as\nfunctions. The labels-as-types approach expresses declassification policies\nusing type abstraction and faceted types, a pair of types representing the\nsecret and public facets of values. The original proposal of labels-as-types is\nformulated in an object-oriented setting where type abstraction is realized by\nsubtyping. The object-oriented approach however suffers from limitations due to\nits receiver-centric paradigm.\n  In this work, we consider an alternative approach to labels-as-types,\napplicable in non-object-oriented languages, which allows us to express\nadvanced declassification policies, such as extrinsic policies, based on a\ndifferent form of type abstraction: existential types. An existential type\nexposes abstract types and operations on these; we leverage this abstraction\nmechanism to express secrets that can be declassified using the provided\noperations.

Characteristics of dust, such as the diversity of particle size,\nporosity, charge, and the manner in which dust couples to turbulent gas, affect\nthe collision outcome and the rate of dust growth. Here we present a numerical\nmodel of the evolution of the dust population within a PPD which incorporates\nall of these effects. The probability that any two particles collide depends on\nthe particle charge, cross-sectional area and their relative velocity. The\nactual collision outcome is determined by a detailed collision model which\ntakes into account the aggregate morphology, trajectory, orientation, and\nelectrostatic forces acting between charged grains. The data obtained in this\nresearch reveal the characteristics of dust populations in different\nenvironments at the end of the hit-and-stick growth, which establishes the\nfoundation for the onset of the next growth stage where bouncing, mass transfer\nand fragmentation become important. For a given level of turbulence, neutral\nand weakly charged particles collide more frequently and grow faster than\nhighly charged particles. However, highly charged particles grow to a larger\nsize before reaching the bouncing barrier, and exhibit a \"Runaway\" growth, in\nwhich a few large particles grow quickly by accreting smaller particles while\nthe rest of the population grows very slowly. In general, highly charged\naggregates have a more compact structure and are comprised of larger monomers\nthan neutral/weakly charged aggregates. The differences in the particle\nstructure/composition not only affect the threshold velocities for bouncing and\nfragmentation, but also change the scattering and absorption opacity of dust,\ninfluencing the appearance of PPDs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 22:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

The use of MPOs accounts for the high\nlevel of generality and wide range of applicability of DMRG. However, current\nalgorithms for two dimensional (2D) tensor network states, known as projected\nentangled-pair states (PEPS), rarely employ the associated 2D tensor network\noperators, projected entangled-pair operators (PEPOs), due to their\ncomputational cost and conceptual complexity.

The expectation value\nof a PEPO can then be evaluated on-the-fly using only the action of MPOs and\ngeneralized MPOs at each step of the approximate contraction of the 2D tensor\nnetwork.

Using all observed data and the Gaia DR2\nparallax of 41.3593 +/- 0.2799 mas for W2150A we deduce fundamental parameters\nof log(Lbol/Lsun)=-3.69 +/- 0.01, Teff=2118 +/- 62 K, and an estimated mass=72\n+/- 12 MJup for the L1 and log(Lbol/Lsun)=-5.64 +/- 0.02, Teff=719 +/- 61 K,\nand an estimated mass=34 +/- 22 MJup for the T8. At a physical separation of\n~341 AU this system has Ebin = 10^41 erg making it the lowest binding energy\nsystem of any pair with Mtot < 0.1 Msun not associated with a young cluster. It\nis equivalent in estimated mass ratio, Ebin, and physical separation to the ~ 2\nMyr M7.25 + M8.25 binary brown dwarf 2MASS J11011926-7732383AB (2M1101AB) found\nin the Chameleon star forming region.

However, there is no much\nwork on analyzing buyers. The key challenge is that the buyers are anonymized\nin darknet markets. For most of the darknet markets, We only observe the first\nand last digits of a buyer's ID, such as ``a**b''.

UNMIX is able to model the temporal dynamics\ninformation as well as the product, comment, and vendor information associated\nwith each transaction.

The energy relaxation rate is related to the friction\ncoefficients felt by individual ions due to their non-adiabatic interactions\nwith electrons. Each coefficient satisfies a Kubo relation given by the time\nintegral of the autocorrelation function of the interaction force between an\nion and the electrons. These Kubo relations are evaluated using the output of\nquantum molecular dynamics calculations in which electrons are treated in the\nframework of finite-temperature density functional theory. The calculation\npresents difficulties that are unlike those encountered with the Kubo formulas\nfor the electrical and thermal conductivities.

To use machine\nlearning to detect phase transitions and accurately identify the critical\ntransition point associated with dynamical processes on complex networks thus\nstands out as an open and significant problem. Here we develop a framework\ncombining supervised and unsupervised learning, incorporating proper sampling\nof training data set.

To overcome the\ndifficulties leads to the idea of exploiting confusion scheme, effectively a\ncombination of supervised and unsupervised learning.

Furthermore, modern developments in quantum gravity suggest\nthat the SM degrees of freedom are not unique; that a typical low energy\neffective theory should include a large assortment of hidden sector degrees of\nfreedom. It is therefore puzzling that cosmological constraints from BBN and\nCMB reveal that the early universe was almost entirely dominated by the SM,\nwhen the inflaton $\\phi$ could have decayed into many sectors. In this work we\npropose the following explanation for all of this: we allow the lowest\ndimension operators with natural coefficients between the inflaton and both the\nHiggs and hidden sectors. Such hidden sectors are assumed to be entirely\nnatural; this means all unprotected masses are pushed up to high scales and\nproject out of the spectrum, while only massless (or protected) degrees of\nfreedom remain, and so the inflaton can only reheat these sectors through\nhigher dimension (and suppressed) operators. On the other hand, the SM\npossesses a special feature: it includes a light Higgs $H$, presumably for life\nto exist, and hence it allows a super-renormalizable coupling to the inflaton\n$\\phi H^\\dagger H$, which allows rapid decay into the SM. We show that this\nnaturally (i) removes the instability in the Higgs potential both during and\nafter inflation due to a tree-level effect that increases the value of the\nHiggs self-coupling from the IR to the UV when one passes the inflaton mass,\n(ii) explains why the SM is dominant in the early universe, (iii) allows dark\nmatter to form in hidden sector/s through subsequent dynamics (or axions, etc),\n(iv) allows for high reheating and baryogenesis, and (v) accounts for why there\nso far has been no direct detection of dark matter or new physics beyond the\nSM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 03:16:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 00:37:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 22:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

As a result, the equimolar elements of Si-Ge-Sn\nalloys likely cause their atomic structures to exhibit the same core effects of\nmetallic HEAs such as lattice distortion.

We\ndiscover that the two streams should communicate with each other, and this is\ncrucial to phase prediction. In addition, we propose frequency transformation\nblocks to catch long-range correlations along the frequency axis. The\nvisualization shows that the learned transformation matrix spontaneously\ncaptures the harmonic correlation, which has been proven to be helpful for T-F\nspectrogram reconstruction. With these two innovations, PHASEN acquires the\nability to handle detailed phase patterns and to utilize harmonic patterns,\ngetting 1.76dB SDR improvement on AVSpeech + AudioSet dataset. It also achieves\nsignificant gains over Google's network on this dataset. On Voice Bank + DEMAND\ndataset, PHASEN outperforms previous methods by a large margin on four metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 06:16:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

Methods to deal with this have been\nproposed that deviate from a fully unsupervised approach, requiring large\nensembles or additional knowledge about the data, not commonly available in the\nreal-world. In this work, the previously offered reasoning behind these issues\nis challenged empirically, and it is shown that data-sets such as MNIST\nfashion/digits and CIFAR10/SVHN are trivially separable and have no overlap on\ntheir respective data manifolds that explains the higher OoD likelihood.

The GRAPES-3 an EAS array\nlocated at Ooty in India (11.4$^{\\circ}$N, 76.7$^{\\circ}$E, 2200 m altitude) is\ndesigned to study $\\gamma$-rays in the TeV-PeV energy range. It comprises of a\ndense array of 400 plastic scintillators deployed over an area of 25000 m$^2$\nand a large area (560 m$^2$) muon telescope. A new statistical method allowed\nreal time determination of the propagation delay of each detector in the\nGRAPES-3 array. The shape of shower front is known to be curved and here the\ndetails of a new method developed for accurate measurement of the shower front\ncurvature is presented. These two developments have led to a sizable\nimprovement in the angular resolution of GRAPES-3 array. It is shown that the\ncurvature depends on the size and age of an EAS. By employing two different\ntechniques, namely, the odd-even and the left-right methods, independent\nestimates of the angular resolution are obtained. The odd-even method estimates\nthe best achievable resolution of the array. For obtaining the angular\nresolution, the left-right method is used after implementing the size and age\ndependent curvature corrections. A comparison of the angular resolution as a\nfunction of EAS energy by these two methods shows them be virtually\nindistinguishable. The angular resolution of GRAPES-3 array is 47$^{\\prime}$\nfor energies E$>$5 TeV and improves to 17$^{\\prime}$ at E$>$100 TeV and finally\napproaching 10$^{\\prime}$ at E$>$500 TeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 07:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

Recently, a\nnew model of delegated quantum computing has been proposed, namely, rational\ndelegated quantum computing. In this model, after the client interacts with the\nserver, the client pays a reward to the server. The rational server sends\nmessages that maximize the expected value of the reward. It is known that the\nclassical client can delegate universal quantum computing to the rational\nquantum server in one round. In this paper, we propose novel one-round rational\ndelegated quantum computing protocols by generalizing the classical rational\nsumcheck protocol. The construction of the previous rational protocols depends\non gate sets, while our sumcheck technique can be easily realized with any\nlocal gate set. Furthermore, as with the previous protocols, our reward\nfunction satisfies natural requirements. We also discuss the reward gap. Simply\nspeaking, the reward gap is a minimum loss on the expected value of the\nserver's reward incurred by the server's behavior that makes the client accept\nan incorrect answer. Although our sumcheck-based protocols have only\nexponentially small reward gaps as in the previous protocols, we show that a\nconstant reward gap can be achieved if two noncommunicating but entangled\nrational servers are allowed. We also discuss whether a single rational server\nis sufficient under the (widely believed) assumption that the\nlearning-with-errors problem is hard for polynomial-time quantum computing.\nApart from these results, we show, under a certain condition, the equivalence\nbetween $rational$ and $ordinary$ delegated quantum computing protocols. This\nequivalence then serves as a basis for a reward-gap amplification method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 08:32:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2022 06:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-07"}

Our main goal is to quantify how\nsuch a star would affect the integrated light of the cluster, and to study the\ndetectability of such objects. We computed non-LTE atmosphere models for SMS\nwith various combinations of stellar parameters (luminosity, effective\ntemperature, and mass) and metallicities appropriate for GCs, and we predict\ntheir emergent spectra. Using these spectra, we calculated the total emission\nof young proto-GCs with SMS as predicted in a previously reported scenario, and\nwe computed synthetic photometry in UV, optical, and near-IR bands, in\nparticular for the JWST. At an effective temperature of 10000 K, the spectrum\nof SMSs shows a Balmer break in emission. This feature is due to strong non-LTE\neffects (implied by the high luminosity) and is not observed in normal stars.\nThe hydrogen lines also show a peculiar behavior, with Balmer lines in emission\nwhile higher series lines are in absorption. At 7000 K, the Balmer break shows\na strong absorption. At high effective temperatures, the Lyman break is found\nin emission. Cool and luminous SMSs are found to dominate the integrated\nspectrum of the cluster, except for the UV range. The predicted magnitudes of\nthese proto-GCs are m_AB~28-30 between 0.7 and 8 um and for redshifts z~4-10,\nwhich is detectable with the JWST. The peculiar observational features of cool\nSMSs imply that they might in principle be detected in color-color diagrams\nthat probe the spectral energy distribution below and above the Balmer break.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 09:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-25"}

They\nare predicted to exhibit a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (LMR) due to\nthe chiral anomaly if the Fermi energy is sufficiently close to the Weyl\npoints. However, current jetting effects, i.e. current inhomogeneities caused\nby a strong, field-induced conductivity anisotropy in semimetals, have a\nsimilar experimental signature and therefore have hindered a determination of\nthe intrinsic LMR in the TaAs family so far. This work investigates the\nlongitudinal magnetoresistance of all four members of this family along the\ncrystallographic $a$ and $c$ direction. Our samples are of similar quality as\nthose previously studied in the literature and have a similar chemical\npotential as indicated by matching quantum oscillation (QO) frequencies. Care\nwas taken to ensure homogeneous currents in all measurements. As opposed to\nprevious studies where this was not done, we find a positive LMR that saturates\nin fields above 4 T in TaP, NbP and NbAs for $B||c$. Using Fermi-surface\ngeometries from band structure calculations that had been confirmed by\nexperiment, we show that this is the behaviour expected from a classical purely\norbital effect, independent on the distance of the Weyl node to the Fermi\nenergy. The TaAs family of compounds is the first to show such a simple LMR\nwithout apparent influences of scattering anisotropy. In configurations where\nthe orbital effect is small, i.e. for $B||a$ in NbAs and NbP, we find a\nnon-monotonous LMR including regions of negative LMR. We discuss a weak\nantilocalisation scenario as an alternative interpretation than the chiral\nanomaly for these results, since it can fully account for the overall field\ndependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 10:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

One of the key reasons being that we have not been able\nto fully understand the heat transfer mechanisms involved in these novel\nsystems.

The main issue is that the policy gradient with respect to the\nexpected return is not available, thus we need to estimate it.

We\ninvestigate scenarios of replenishing the mass reservoir around a star via\ncapturing and infalling events of cloudlets. We carry out altogether 24\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of cloudlet encounters with a\nHerbig star of mass 2.5 solar mass using the moving mesh code AREPO. To account\nfor the two possibilities of a star or a cloudlet traveling through the\ninterstellar medium (ISM), we put either the star or the cloudlet at rest with\nrespect to the background gas. For absent cooling in the adiabatic runs, almost\nnone of the cloudlet gas is captured due to high thermal pressure. However,\nsecond-generation disks easily form when accounting for cooling of the gas. The\ndisk radii range from several 100 au to about 1000 au and associated arc-like\nstructures up to 10 000 au in length form around the star for runs with and\nwithout stellar irradiation. Consistent with angular momentum conservation, the\narcs and disks are larger for larger impact parameters. Accounting for\nturbulence in the cloudlet only mildly changes the model outcome. In the case\nof the star being at rest with the background gas, the disk formation and mass\nreplenishment process is more pronounced and the associated arc-shaped\nstreamers are longer-lived. The results of our models confirm that late\nencounter events lead to the formation of transitional disks associated with\narc-shaped structures such as observed for AB Aurigae or HD 100546. In\naddition, we find that second-generation disks and their associated filamentary\narms are longer lived (>100 000 yrs) in infall events, when the star is at rest\nwith the background gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 13:19:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-25"}

A major challenge\nfor the analysis and understanding of such a paradigm shift is the lack of\nmathematically tractable and numerically reproducible channel models that\nretain some semblance to the physical reality. Detailed physical models are, in\ngeneral, too complex for tractable analysis. This paper aims to take a closer\nlook at this interdisciplinary challenge. Particularly, we consider the\nsmall-scale fading in the far-field, and we model it as a zero-mean,\nspatially-stationary, and correlated Gaussian scalar random field.\nPhysically-meaningful correlation is obtained by requiring that the random\nfield be consistent with the scalar Helmholtz equation. This formulation leads\ndirectly to a rather simple and exact description of the three-dimensional\nsmall-scale fading as a Fourier plane-wave spectral representation. Suitably\ndiscretized, this leads to a discrete representation for the field as a Fourier\nplane-wave series expansion, from which a computationally efficient way to\ngenerate samples of the small-scale fading over spatially-constrained compact\nspaces is developed. The connections with the conventional tools of linear\nsystems theory and Fourier transform are thoroughly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 13:55:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 09:24:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 14:26:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 17:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

In the retrofit control framework, the\nnetwork system to be controlled is regarded as an interconnected system\ncomposed of the subsystem of interest and an environment. Existing studies have\nrevealed that all retrofit controllers can be characterized as a constrained\nYoula parameterization under the technical assumption that the subsystem of\ninterest is stable. It has also been discovered that all of the retrofit\ncontrollers that belong to a particular tractable class have a distinctive\ninternal structure composed of a rectifier and an internal controller under the\nadditional technical assumption that the interconnection signal from the\nenvironment to the subsystem of interest is measurable or that the internal\nstate of the subsystem of interest is measurable. Due to the internal\nstructure, the retrofit controller design problem under the assumptions can be\nreduced to a standard controller design problem to which existing controller\nsynthesis techniques can be applied. The aim of this paper is to extend the\nabove results without the technical assumptions. It is found that the existing\ndevelopments can naturally be generalized through the Youla parameterization\nfor unstable systems and an explicit description of the inverse system with the\ngeometric control theory. The result leads to the conclusion that retrofit\ncontrollers can readily be designed even in the general case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 14:55:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 11:48:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

To empower MTC with intelligence, edge machine learning\nhas been proposed. However, power allocation in this paradigm requires\nmaximizing the learning performance instead of the communication throughput,\nfor which the celebrated water-filling and max-min fairness algorithms become\ninefficient. To this end, this paper proposes learning centric power allocation\n(LCPA), which provides a new perspective on radio resource allocation in\nlearning driven scenarios. By employing 1) an empirical classification error\nmodel that is supported by learning theory and 2) an uncertainty sampling\nmethod that accounts for different distributions at users, LCPA is formulated\nas a nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem, and is solved using a\nmajorization minimization (MM) framework. To get deeper insights into LCPA,\nasymptotic analysis shows that the transmit powers are inversely proportional\nto the channel gains, and scale exponentially with the learning parameters.\nThis is in contrast to traditional power allocations where quality of wireless\nchannels is the only consideration. Last but not least, a large-scale\noptimization algorithm termed mirror-prox LCPA is further proposed to enable\nLCPA in large-scale settings. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that the\nproposed LCPA algorithms outperform traditional power allocation algorithms,\nand the large-scale optimization algorithm reduces the computation time by\norders of magnitude compared with MM-based LCPA but still achieves competing\nlearning performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 15:10:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 03:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

Depending on the presence and\nmagnitude of such a transformation, effective properties of a metamaterial may\nchange significantly. To capture this phenomenon accurately and efficiently,\nhomogenization schemes are required that reflect microstructural as well as\nmacro-structural instabilities, large deformations, and non-local effects. To\nthis end, a micromorphic computational homogenization scheme has recently been\ndeveloped, which employs the particular microstructural transformation as a\nnon-local mechanism, magnitude of which is governed by an additional coupled\npartial differential equation. Upon discretizing the resulting problem it turns\nout that the macroscopic stiffness matrix requires integration of macro-element\nbasis functions as well as their derivatives, thus calling for a higher-order\nintegration rules. Because evaluation of constitutive law in multiscale schemes\ninvolves an expensive solution of a non-linear boundary value problem,\ncomputational efficiency can be improved by reducing the number of integration\npoints. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to investigate reduced-order\nschemes in computational homogenization, with emphasis on the stability of the\nresulting elements. In particular, arguments for lowering the order of\nintegration from the expensive mass-matrix to a cheaper stiffness-matrix\nequivalent are first outlined. An efficient one-point integration quadrilateral\nelement is then introduced and proper hourglass stabilization discussed.\nPerformance of the resulting set of elements is finally tested on a benchmark\nbending example, showing that we achieve accuracy comparable to the full\nquadrature rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 10:47:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 20:33:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-16"}

The EHR data can be\nregarded as a collection of clinical events, including laboratory results,\nmedication records, physiological indicators, etc, which can be used for\nclinical outcome prediction tasks to support constructions of intelligent\nhealth systems. Learning patient representation from these clinical events for\nthe clinical outcome prediction is an important but challenging step. Most\nrelated studies transform EHR data of a patient into a sequence of clinical\nevents in temporal order and then use sequential models to learn patient\nrepresentations for outcome prediction. However, clinical event sequence\ncontains thousands of event types and temporal dependencies. We further make an\nobservation that clinical events occurring in a short period are not\nconstrained by any temporal order but events in a long term are influenced by\ntemporal dependencies. The multi-scale temporal property makes it difficult for\ntraditional sequential models to capture the short-term co-occurrence and the\nlong-term temporal dependencies in clinical event sequences. In response to the\nabove challenges, this paper proposes a Multi-level Representation Model (MRM).\nMRM first uses a sparse attention mechanism to model the short-term\nco-occurrence, then uses interval-based event pooling to remove redundant\ninformation and reduce sequence length and finally predicts clinical outcomes\nthrough Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

Recently, studies have shown that GAN can also\nbe applied to generative adversarial attack examples to fool the\nmachine-learning models. In comparison with the previous non-learning\nadversarial example attack approaches, the GAN-based adversarial attack example\napproach can generate the adversarial samples quickly using the GAN\narchitecture every time facing a new sample after training, but meanwhile needs\nto perturb the attack samples in great quantities, which results in the\nunpractical application in reality. To address this issue, we propose a new\napproach, named Few-Feature-Attack-GAN (FFA-GAN). FFA-GAN has a significant\ntime-consuming advantage than the non-learning adversarial samples approaches\nand a better non-zero-features performance than the GANbased adversarial sample\napproaches. FFA-GAN can automatically generate the attack samples in the\nblack-box attack through the GAN architecture instead of the evolutional\nalgorithms or the other non-learning approaches. Besides, we introduce the mask\nmechanism into the generator network of the GAN architecture to optimize the\nconstraint issue, which can also be regarded as the sparsity problem of the\nimportant features.

Based on the\nobservations from this work, supplemented by feedback received during multiple\ndesign explorations and stakeholder conversations, we make recommendations for\neasing the collection and flexible presentation of AI facts to promote\ntransparency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 23:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

We explore this\napproach in document retrieval for a fact extraction and verification task.

By merging\ntechniques of structural geology, statistical image processing, and solar\nsystem science, this thesis aims to contribute to the understanding of the\nformation of the layerings, and thus of cometary nuclei as a whole. I describe\nthe two distinctive approaches to studying the layerings' orientation on comet\n67P's nucleus. First, I mapped layering-related linear features on a 3D shape\nmodel of the nucleus, onto which I projected high-res OSIRIS images. I selected\nonly lineaments of substantial curvature, and used a plane-fitting algorithm to\nfind the normals to the layering planes represented by these lineaments. I used\nthe normals to confirm previous authors' results, including that the layering\nsystems on the comet's two lobes are geometrically independent from each other.\nMy results rule out the proposal that 67P's lobes represent collisional\nfragments of a much larger, layered body. Second, I developed a Fourier-based\nimage analysis algorithm to detect lineament structures at pixel-precision. I\nanalysed the layering-related features exposed on the Hathor cliff on the\ncomet's Small Lobe. I found my algorithm to be a broadly applicable, powerful\ntool for automating the detection of layerings in images where conventional\nedge-detection algorithms are not effective. When correctly configured to the\ntarget conditions, I found the algorithm to have a higher signal-to-noise\ndetection sensitivity than a human, while reducing over-interpretation due to\nbias. In summary, I studied the layerings in the nucleus of comet 67P using\nseveral unconventional approaches and constrained their lateral extent,\ncurvature, and to a degree also their thickness. Finally, I nominated two\nmechanisms that could have formed these layerings in cometary nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 12:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-16"}

When facing high demand, the use of backroom storage and intraday\nshelf replenishment is necessary to avoid stock-out. In that context, the\nmandatory input for any successful replenishment policy to be implemented is\naccess to reliable forecasts for the sales at an intraday granularity. To that\nend, we use quantile regression to adapt different patterns from one product to\nthe other, and we develop a stable and efficient quantile additive model\nalgorithm to compute sales forecasts in an intradaily context. Our algorithm is\ncomputationally fast and is therefore suitable for use in real-time dynamic\nshelf replenishment. As an illustration, we examine the case of a highly\nfrequented store, where the demand for various alimentary products is\naccurately estimated over the day with the help of the proposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 16:23:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}
