Black hole spectroscopy\nhas long been proposed as a way to test the no-hair theorem, that is, how\nclosely an astrophysical black hole can be described by the Kerr geometry. We\nuse simulations from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes project to assess the\ndetectability of one extra quasinormal mode in the ringdown of a binary black\nhole coalescence, with numbers $(\\ell,m,n)$ distinct from the fundamental\nquadrupolar mode (2,2,0). Our approach uses the complex waveform as well as the\ntime derivative of the phase in two prescriptions that allow us to estimate the\npoint at which the ringdown is best described by a single mode or by a sum of\ntwo modes. By scaling all amplitudes to $t_{\\rm peak}+10M$, our results for\nnon-spinning binaries indicate that for mass ratios of 1:1 to 5:1 the first\novertone (2,2,1) will always have a larger excitation amplitude than the\nfundamental modes of other harmonics, making it a more promising candidate for\ndetection. Even though the (2,2,1) mode damps about three times faster than the\nhigher harmonics and its frequency is very close to that of the (2,2,0) mode,\nits larger excitation amplitude still guarantees a more favorable scenario for\ndetection. In particular, for equal-mass binaries the ratio of the amplitude of\nthe first overtone (2,2,1) to the fundamental mode (2,2,0) will be $> 0.65$,\nwhereas the corresponding ratio for the higher harmonics will be $< 0.05$.

In these\nmicrostructured materials, the dispersion properties governing the free dynamic\npropagation of elastic waves can be studied by formulating parametric\nlagrangian models and applying the Floquet-Bloch theory. Within this framework,\ngoverning the wave propagation by means of spectral design techniques and/or\nenergy dissipation mechanisms is a major issue of theoretical and applied\ninterest. Specifically, the wave propagation can be inhibited by purposely\ndesigning the microstructural parameters to open band gaps in the material\nspectrum at target center frequencies. Based on these motivations, a general\ndynamic formulation for determining the dispersion properties of beam lattice\nmetamaterials, equipped with local resonators is presented. The mechanism of\nlocal resonance is realized by tuning periodic auxiliary masses,\nviscoelastically coupled with the beam lattice microstructure. As peculiar\naspect, the viscoelastic coupling is derived by a mechanical formulation based\non the Boltzmann superposition integral, whose kernel is approximated by a\nProny series. Consequently, the free propagation of damped waves is governed by\na linear homogeneous system of integral-differential equations of motion.\nTherefore, differential equations of motion with frequency-dependent\ncoefficients are obtained by applying the bilateral Laplace transform. The\ncorresponding complex-valued branches characterizing the dispersion spectrum\nare determined and parametrically analyzed. Particularly, the spectra\ncorresponding to Taylor series approximations of the equation coefficients are\ninvestigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 16:40:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-04"}

A\ncommon approach to conserve bandwidth involves resizing or compressing data\nprior to training. We introduce Progressive Compressed Records (PCRs), a data\nformat that uses compression to reduce the overhead of fetching and\ntransporting data, effectively reducing the training time required to achieve a\ntarget accuracy. PCRs deviate from previous storage formats by combining\nprogressive compression with an efficient storage layout to view a single\ndataset at multiple fidelities---all without adding to the total dataset size.\nWe implement PCRs and evaluate them on a range of datasets, training tasks, and\nhardware architectures. Our work shows that: (i) the amount of compression a\ndataset can tolerate exceeds 50% of the original encoding for many DL training\ntasks; (ii) it is possible to automatically and efficiently select appropriate\ncompression levels for a given task; and (iii) PCRs enable tasks to readily\naccess compressed data at runtime---utilizing as little as half the training\nbandwidth and thus potentially doubling training speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 17:28:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 00:03:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 01:17:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 21:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-13"}

As the gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) has been regarded as a dated measure and tool for benchmarking a\nnation's economic performance, there has been a growing consensus for an\nalternative measure---such as a composite `wellbeing' index---to holistically\ncapture a country's socioeconomic health performance. Many conventional ways of\nconstructing wellbeing/health indices involve combining different observable\nmetrics, such as life expectancy and education level, to form an index.\nHowever, health is inherently latent with metrics actually being observable\nindicators of health. In contrast to the GDP or other conventional health\nindices, our approach provides a holistic quantification of the overall\n`health' of a nation. We build upon the latent health factor index (LHFI)\napproach that has been used to assess the unobservable ecological/ecosystem\nhealth. This framework integratively models the relationship between metrics,\nthe latent health, and the covariates that drive the notion of health. In this\npaper, the LHFI structure is integrated with spatial modeling and statistical\ncausal modeling, so as to evaluate the impact of a policy variable (mandatory\nmaternity leave days) on a nation's socioeconomic health, while formally\naccounting for spatial dependency among the nations. We apply our model to\ncountries around the world using data on various metrics and potential\ncovariates pertaining to different aspects of societal health. The approach is\nstructured in a Bayesian hierarchical framework and results are obtained by\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 18:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

In general we find that the planets and the disc do not remain\ncoplanar, in agreement with Lubow & Martin (2016) for the single planet case.\nInstead, the planets and the disc undergo tilt oscillations. A high mass disc\nbetween the two planets causes the planets and the disc to nodally precess at\nthe same average rate but they are generally misaligned. The amplitude of the\ntilt oscillations between the planets is larger while the disc is present.

These itemsets structure the search space into\nequivalence classes such that each class gathers the itemsets appearing in the\nsame subset aka objects or transactions of the given data. In this respect, we\nproposed lossless reductions of the minimal generator set thanks to a new\nsubstitution-based process. Our theoretical results are extended to the\nassociation rule framework in order to reduce as much as possible the number of\nretained rules without information loss. We then give a thorough formal study\nof the related inference mechanism allowing to derive all redundant association\nrules, starting from the retained ones. We also lead a thorough exploration of\nthe disjunctive search space, where itemsets are characterized by their\nrespective disjunctive supports, instead of the conjunctive ones. This\nexploration is motivated by the fact that, in some applications, such\ninformation brings richer knowledge to the end-users. To obtain a redundancy\nfree representation of the disjunctive search space, an interesting solution\nconsists in selecting a unique element to represent itemsets covering the same\nset of data. Two itemsets are equivalent if their respective items cover the\nsame set of data. In this regard, we introduced a new operator dedicated to\nthis task. In each induced equivalence class, minimal elements are called\nessential itemsets, while the largest one is called disjunctive closed itemset.\nThe introduced operator is then at the roots of new concise representations of\nfrequent itemsets.

Unfortunately, certain NVMs\nsuch as phase change memory (PCM) require high voltages for correct operation.\nThese voltages are supplied from an on-chip charge pump. If the charge pump is\nactivated too frequently, its internal CMOS devices do not recover from stress,\naccelerating their aging and leading to negative bias temperature instability\n(NBTI) generated defects. Forcefully discharging the stressed charge pump can\nlower the aging rate of its CMOS devices, but makes the neuromorphic hardware\nunavailable to perform computations while its charge pump is being discharged.\nThis negatively impacts performance such as latency and accuracy of the machine\nlearning workload being executed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework\nto exploit workload-specific performance and lifetime trade-offs in\nneuromorphic computing. Our framework first extracts the precise times at which\na charge pump in the hardware is activated to support neural computations\nwithin a workload. This timing information is then used with a characterized\nNBTI reliability model to estimate the charge pump's aging during the workload\nexecution. We use our framework to evaluate workload-specific performance and\nreliability impacts of using 1) different SNN mapping strategies and 2)\ndifferent charge pump discharge strategies.

Live bidirectional\nevaluation enables Smyth to (a) synthesize recursive functions without\ntrace-complete sets of examples and (b) specify and solve interdependent\nsynthesis goals. Eliminating the trace-completeness requirement resolves a\nsignificant limitation faced by prior synthesis techniques when given partial\nspecifications in the form of input-output examples.\n  To assess the practical implications of our techniques, we ran several\nexperiments on benchmarks used to evaluate Myth, a state-of-the-art\nexample-based synthesis tool. First, given expert examples (and no partial\nimplementations), we find that Smyth requires on average 66% of the number of\nexpert examples required by Myth. Second, we find that Smyth is robust to\nrandomly-generated examples, synthesizing many tasks with relatively few more\nrandom examples than those provided by an expert.

Those programs (called SAT-solvers) have been intensively developed\nfor many years and - despite their worst-case exponential time complexity - are\nable to solve a multitude of hard practical instances. A drawback of this\napproach is that clauses are neither expressive, nor compact, and using them to\ndescribe decision problems can pose a big challenge on its own.\n  We can improve this by using high-level constraints as a bridge between a\nproblem at hand and SAT.

While entanglement witnesses based on the\nfidelity to the target entangled state are efficient detectors of entanglement,\nthey in general underestimate the amount of entanglement due to errors during\nstate preparation and measurement. Therefore, to detect entanglement more\nrobustly in the presence of such control errors, we introduce a 'subspace'\nwitness that detects a broader class of entangled states with strictly larger\nviolation than the conventional state-fidelity witness at the cost of\nadditional measurements, while remaining more efficient with respect to state\ntomography. We experimentally demonstrate the advantages of the subspace\nwitness by generating and detecting entanglement with a hybrid, two-qubit\nsystem composed of electronic spins in diamond. We further extend the notion of\nsubspace witness to specific genuine multipartite entangled (GME) states such\nas GHZ, W, and Dicke states, and motivate the choice of the metric based on\nquantum information tasks such as entanglement-enhanced sensing. In addition,\nas the subspace witness identifies the many-body coherences of the target\nentangled state, it facilitates (beyond detection) lower-bound quantification\nof entanglement via generalized concurrences.

However, most such mechanisms do not take into consideration\nthe valid range of the query being posed. Thus, noisy responses that fall\noutside of this range may potentially be produced. To rectify this and\ntherefore improve the utility of the mechanism, the commonly used Laplace\ndistribution can be truncated to the valid range of the query and then\nnormalized.

Multiple lightcurve analysis\ntechniques, coupled with theoretical considerations and delay-doppler radar\nimaging, allows us to assign these periods to specific rotational axes of the\nbody. In particular we suggest that Duende is now in a non-principal, short\naxis mode rotation state with a precessional period equal to P_1 and\noscillation about the symmetry axis at a rate equal to P_2. Temporal and\nsignal-to-noise limitations inherent to the pre-flyby photometric dataset make\nit difficult to definitively diagnose whether these periods represent a change\nimparted due to gravitational torques during the flyby. However, based on\nmultiple analysis techniques and a number of plausibility arguments, we suggest\nthat Duende experienced a rotational change during the planetary encounter with\nan increase in its precessional rotation period. Our preferred interpretation\nof the available data is that the precession rate increased from 8.4 hours\nprior to the flyby to 8.7 hours afterwards. A companion paper by Benson et al.\n(2019) provides a more detailed dynamical analysis of this event and compares\nthe data to synthetic lightcurves computed from a simple shape model of Duende.\n(abbreviated abstract)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 22:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

In this paper, we build a theoretical framework for\ncalculating the optical depth of H$_2$ ro-vibrational line cooling based on the\nvertical structure in these accretion disks. Applying this physically motivated\nprescription for the optical depth, we find that cooling in the inner disk with\n$r \\lesssim 10 {\\rm\\ AU}$ is attenuated significantly as a result of high\nsurface density; $PdV$ heating becomes more efficient than cooling, which\nprevents fragmentation in the inner disk. Despite this, cooling becomes\ndynamically important in the outer disk, favoring fragmentation. We argue that\nmost of the resultant fragments are initially at the outer disk, and that any\nsurviving fragment has to migrate slower than the disk-scale photo-evaporation\nprocess. Since type I migration is fast, migration slows down as a result of\ngap-opening in the disk structure. Two possible processes for gap-opening are\nstudied: (1) through a massive, densely-cored ($\\rho \\gtrsim 10^{-8} {\\rm\\ g\\\ncm^{-3}}$) clump able to radiate away the excess gravitational potential\nenergy, and (2) through a fast-growing central star, with $\\dot{M} \\gtrsim 2\n\\times 10^{-3} \\, M_\\odot {\\rm\\ yr^{-1}}$, whose gravity dominates the\nstar-disk system and favors gap opening.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 23:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

We also demonstrate that a minimal model with 15 modes,\nobtained from the truncated Euler equation, is able to capture the bifurcations\nof the large scale jets exhibited by the Navier-Stokes equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2019 01:26:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 16:34:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 11:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

This will free user interaction for analysis and lead\nto a 'one-click' solution to improve workflow. This paper proposes a deep\nneural network based computational workflow for inline myocardial perfusion\nanalysis. Adenosine stress and rest perfusion scans were acquired from three\nhospitals. Training set included N=1,825 perfusion series from 1,034 patients.\nIndependent test set included 200 scans from 105 patients. Data were\nconsecutively acquired at each site. A convolution neural net (CNN) model was\ntrained to provide segmentation for LV cavity, myocardium and right ventricular\nby processing incoming 2D+T perfusion Gd series. Model outputs were compared to\nmanual ground-truth for accuracy of segmentation and flow measures derived on\nglobal and per-sector basis. The trained models were integrated onto MR\nscanners for effective inference. Segmentation accuracy and myocardial flow\nmeasures were compared between CNN models and manual ground-truth. The mean\nDice ratio of CNN derived myocardium was 0.93 +/- 0.04. Both global flow and\nper-sector values showed no significant difference, compared to manual results.\nThe AHA 16 segment model was automatically generated and reported on the MR\nscanner. As a result, the fully automated analysis of perfusion flow mapping\nwas achieved. This solution was integrated on the MR scanner, enabling\n'one-click' analysis and reporting of myocardial blood flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2019 01:33:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 14:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

Shortwave absorption in the\natmosphere reduces the incoming radiation reaching the surface but warms the\nupper atmosphere, significantly shifting the habitable zone toward the star.\nThe strong stratification under high shortwave absorptivity suppresses the\nHadley cell in a manner that matches previous Hadley cell scalings. General\ncirculation changes may be observable through cloud coverage and superrotation.\nThe equatorial superrotation in the upper atmosphere strengthens with the\nshortwave opacity, as predicted based on the gradient wind of the\nradiative-convective equilibrium profile. There is a sudden drop of equatorial\nsuperrotation at very low shortwave opacity. This is because the Hadley cell in\nthose cases are strong enough to fill the entire troposphere with zero momentum\nair from the surface. A diurnal cycle (westward motion of substellar point\nrelative to the planet) leads to acceleration of the equatorial westerlies in\ngeneral, through the enhancement of the equatorward eddy momentum transport,\nbut the response is not completely monotonic, perhaps due to the resonance of\ntropical waves and the diurnal forcing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2019 02:34:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

Among the various models used by HEVC rate control\nalgorithms, the R-${\\lambda}$ model performs the best in both coding efficiency\nand rate control accuracy.

To understand how dust\npolarization varies with grain mechanical properties and the local environment,\nin this paper, we model the wavelength-dependence polarization of starlight and\npolarized dust emission by aligned grains by simultaneously taking into account\ngrain alignment and rotational disruption by radiative torques (RATs). We\nexplore a wide range of the local radiation field and grain mechanical\nproperties characterized by tensile strength. We find that the maximum\npolarization and the peak wavelength shift to shorter wavelengths as the\nradiation strength $U$ increases due to the enhanced alignment of small grains.\nGrain rotational disruption by RATs tends to decrease the optical-near infrared\npolarization but increases the ultraviolet polarization of starlight due to the\nconversion of large grains into smaller ones. In particular, we find that the\nsubmillimeter (submm) polarization degree at $850~\\mu \\rm m$ ($P_{850}$) does\nnot increase monotonically with the radiation strength or grain temperature\n($T_{d}$), but it depends on the tensile strength of grain materials.

In this paper, we consider the\norigin that can be broken down into three categories: natural photographic\nimage (NPI), computer generated graphic (CGG), and deep network generated image\n(DGI). A method is presented for effectively identifying the origin of digital\nimages that is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and uses a\nlocal-to-global framework to reduce training complexity. By feeding labeled\ndata, the CNN is trained to predict the origin of local patches cropped from an\nimage. The origin of the full-size image is then determined by majority voting.\nUnlike previous forensic methods, the CNN takes the raw pixels as input without\nthe aid of \"residual map\". Experimental results revealed that not only the\nhigh-frequency components but also the middle-frequency ones contribute to\norigin identification. The proposed method achieved up to 95.21% identification\naccuracy and behaved robustly against several common post-processing operations\nincluding JPEG compression, scaling, geometric transformation, and contrast\nstretching. The quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed method is\nmore effective than handcrafted feature-based methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2019 05:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

Echo imaging\nquality and acquisition time is highly dependent on the operator's experience\nlevel. Recent developments have shown the possibility of automating echo image\nquality quantification by mapping an expert's assessment of quality to the echo\nimage via deep learning techniques.

However, readers occasionally need to make longer saccades\n(known as return-sweeps) that take their eyes from the end of one line of text\nto the beginning of the next. In this study, we tested whether return-sweep\nsaccades are also guided by font size information and whether this guidance\ndepends on visual acuity of the return-sweep target area. To do this, we\nmanipulated the font size of letters (0.29 vs 0.39 deg. per character) and the\nlength of the first line of text (16 vs 26 deg.). The larger font resulted in\nreturn-sweeps that landed further to the right of the line start and in a\nreduction of under-sweeps compared to the smaller font. This suggests that font\nsize information is used when programming return-sweeps. Return-sweeps in the\nlonger line condition landed further to the right of the line start and the\nproportion of under-sweeps increased compared to the short line condition. This\nlikely reflects an increase in saccadic undershoot error with the increase in\nintended saccade size. Critically, there was no interaction between font size\nand line length. This suggests that when programming return-sweeps, the use of\nfont size information does not depend on visual acuity at the saccade target.\nInstead, it appears that readers rely on global typographic properties of the\ntext in order to maintain an optimal number of characters to the left of their\nfirst fixation on a new line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2019 13:48:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 10:23:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 19:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-07"}

This leads to one of the\nfundamental problems of conservation ecology: how should we harvest a\npopulation so that economic gain is maximized, while also ensuring that the\nspecies is safe from extinction? We study an ecosystem of interacting species\nthat are influenced by random environmental fluctuations. At any point in time,\nwe can either harvest or seed (repopulate) species. Harvesting brings an\neconomic gain while seeding incurs a cost. The problem is to find the optimal\nharvesting-seeding strategy that maximizes the expected total income from\nharvesting minus the cost one has to pay for the seeding of various species. We\nconsider what happens when one, or both, of the seeding and harvesting rates\nare bounded. The focus of this paper is the analysis of these three novel\nsettings: bounded seeding and infinite harvesting, bounded seeding and bounded\nharvesting, and infinite seeding and bounded harvesting.\n  We prove analytical results and develop numerical approximation methods. By\nimplementing these approximations, we are able to gain qualitative information\nabout how to best harvest and seed species.

In such filtering, the upper\nand the lower fences establish a robust range that excludes noise outliers\nwhile including the signal of interest and the non-outlier noise. Then, the\noutlier values are replaced with those in mid-range. To increase the\neffectiveness of outlier noise identification, and to minimize the false\nnegatives, the fences need to be both tight and robust to outlier noise. On the\nother hand, to minimize the false positives and to avoid the detrimental\neffects, such as instabilities and excessive distortions, often associated with\nnonlinear filtering, the fences need to be inclusive, so that the signal of\ninterest and the non-outlier noise remain within the fences. Quantile Tracking\nFilters (QTFs) are an appealing choice for such robust fencing in\nintermittently nonlinear filtering, as QTFs are analog filters suitable for\nwideband real-time processing of continuous-time signals and are easily\nimplemented in analog circuitry. Further, their numerical computations are O(1)\nper output value in both time and storage, which also enables their high-rate\ndigital implementations in real time.

Methods: A set of ten peg\ntransfer videos (5 novices, 5 experts), were used to evaluate the perceived\nskill of the performers at each video playback speed used (0.4x-3.6x).\nObjective metrics used for measuring technical skill were also computed for\ncomparison by manipulating the corresponding kinematic data of each\nperformance.

Recent approaches address this\nchallenge by learning performance models based on a sample set of\nconfigurations. However, collecting enough sample configurations can be very\nexpensive since each such sample requires configuring, compiling, and executing\nthe entire system using a complex test suite. When learning on new data is too\nexpensive, it is possible to use \\textit{Transfer Learning} to \"transfer\" old\nlessons to the new context. Traditional transfer learning has a number of\nchallenges, specifically, (a) learning from excessive data takes excessive\ntime, and (b) the performance of the models built via transfer can deteriorate\nas a result of learning from a poor source. To resolve these problems, we\npropose a novel transfer learning framework called BEETLE, which is a\n\"bellwether\"-based transfer learner that focuses on identifying and learning\nfrom the most relevant source from amongst the old data.

The impact of this issue in\napplied nuclear science has been discussed widely in recent years. Commonly\nsuggested causes are: poor estimates of specific error components, neglect of\nuncertainty correlations, and overlooked known error sources. However,\ninstances have been reported where very careful, objective assessments of all\nknown error sources have been made with realistic error magnitudes and\ncorrelations provided, yet the resulting evaluated uncertainties still appear\nto be inconsistent with observed scatter of predicted mean values. These\ndiscrepancies might be attributed to significant unrecognized sources of\nuncertainty (USU) that limit the accuracy to which these physical quantities\ncan be determined. The objective of our work has been to develop procedures for\nrevealing and including USU estimates in nuclear data evaluations involving\nexperimental input data. We conclude that the presence of USU may be revealed,\nand estimates of magnitudes made, through quantitative analyses. This paper\nidentifies several specific clues that can be explored by evaluators in\nidentifying the existence of USU. It then describes numerical procedures to\ngenerate quantitative estimates of USU magnitudes. Key requirements for these\nprocedures to be viable are that sufficient numbers of data points be\navailable, for statistical reasons, and that additional supporting information\nabout the measurements be provided by the experimenters. Realistic examples are\ndescribed to illustrate these procedures and demonstrate their outcomes as well\nas limitations.

We prove\nthat there are relations between the length of the longest common extension (or\nlongest common prefix) $lcp(x,y)$ of two different suffixes $x,y$ of a word $w$\nand the maximum length $\\mathcal{M}$ of two consecutive factors of the inverse\nLyndon factorization of $w$.

The second step is to identify Br(k_\\nu), the Brauer group of the\nlocal fields. The third step is to construct two maps Br(Q) to Br(R) and Br(Q)\nto Br(Q_p) and to use these two maps to understand Br(Q).

The proposed, experienced deep-RL\nframework can guarantee high end-to-end reliability and low end-to-end latency,\nunder explicit data rate constraints, for each wireless without any models of\nor assumptions on the users' traffic. In particular, in order to enable the\ndeep-RL framework to account for extreme network conditions and operate in\nhighly reliable systems, a new approach based on generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs) is proposed. This GAN approach is used to pre-train the deep-RL\nframework using a mix of real and synthetic data, thus creating an experienced\ndeep-RL framework that has been exposed to a broad range of network conditions.\nFormally, the URLLC resource allocation problem is posed as a power\nminimization problem under reliability, latency, and rate constraints. To solve\nthis problem using experienced deep-RL, first, the rate of each user is\ndetermined. Then, these rates are mapped to the resource block and power\nallocation vectors of the studied wireless system. Finally, the end-to-end\nreliability and latency of each user are used as feedback to the deep-RL\nframework. It is then shown that at the fixed-point of the deep-RL algorithm,\nthe reliability and latency of the users are near-optimal. Moreover, for the\nproposed GAN approach, a theoretical limit for the generator output is\nanalytically derived. Simulation results show how the proposed approach can\nachieve near-optimal performance within the rate-reliability-latency region,\ndepending on the network and service requirements. The results also show that\nthe proposed experienced deep-RL framework is able to remove the transient\ntraining time that makes conventional deep-RL methods unsuitable for URLLC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 16:50:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 01:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-15"}

Most\nimportantly, our study reveals that the present $f(R,T)$ gravity model can\nsuitably explain the super-Chandrasekhar limiting mass white dwarfs, which are\nsupposed to be the reason behind the over-luminous SNeIa and remain mostly\nunexplained in the background of general relativity (GR).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2019 12:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

Poststack depth migration in frequency-space\n(f-x) domain is one of commonly used algorithms. The wave-equation solution can\nbe approximated as FIR filtering process to extrapolate the raw data and\nextract the subsurface image. Because of its computational complexity, its\nparallel implementation is encouraged. For calculating the next depth level,\nprevious depth level is required. So, this part cannot be parallelized because\nof data dependence. But at each depth level there is plenty of roam for\nparallelism and can be parallelized. In case of CUDA programming, each thread\ncalculate a single pixel on the next depth plan. After calculating the next\ndepth plan, we can calculate the depth row by summing over all the frequencies\nand calculating all the depth rows results in the final migrated image. The\npoststack depth migration is implemented in CUDA and its performance is\nevaluated with the sequential code with different problem sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2019 01:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-12"}

There are both\nlossy and lossless image compression format available and JPEG is one of the\npopular lossy compression among them. In this paper, we present the\narchitecture and implementation of JPEG compression using VHDL (VHSIC Hardware\nDescription Language) and compare the performance with some contemporary\nimplementation. JPEG compression takes place in five steps with color space\nconversion, down sampling, discrete cosine transformation (DCT), quantization,\nand entropy encoding. The five steps cover for the compression purpose only.\nAdditionally, we implement the reverse order in VHDL to get the original image\nback. We use optimized matrix multiplication and quantization for DCT to\nachieve better performance. Our experimental results show that significant\namount of compression ratio has been achieved with very little change in the\nimages, which is barely noticeable to human eye.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 22:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

In addition to their main use as connecting elements,\ntransmission lines can also be employed as continuous sensors for the\nmeasurement and detection of external influences such as mechanical strains and\ndeformations. The measuring principle is based on deformation-induced changes\nof the characteristic impedance. Reflections of an injected test signal at\nresulting impedance mismatches can be used to infer applied deformations. To\ndetermine the effect of deformations on the characteristic impedance, we\ndevelop a numerical framework that allows us to solve Maxwell's equations for\nany desired transmission-line geometry over a wide frequency range. The\nproposed framework utilizes a staggered finite-difference Yee method on\nnon-uniform grids to efficiently solve a set of decoupled partial differential\nequations that we derive from the frequency domain Maxwell equations. To test\nour framework, we compare simulation results with analytical predictions and\ncorresponding experimental data. Our results suggest that the proposed\nnumerical framework is able to capture experimentally observed deformation\neffects and may therefore be used in transmission-line-based deformation and\nstrain sensing applications. Furthermore, our framework can also be utilized to\nsimulate and study the electromagnetic properties of complex arrangements of\nconductor, insulator, and shielding materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2019 11:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}
