In contrast to the reduced density matrix of an open quantum\nsystem, or the reduced phase-space probability density function of a classical\nopen system, the Hamiltonian of mean force not only characterizes the reduced\nstate but also contains full information about the thermodynamics of the\nconsidered open system. The resulting thermodynamic potentials all assume the\nform as the difference of the potentials for the total system and the bare\nenvironment in the absence of the system. In contrast to work as a mechanical\nnotion, one faces several problems with the definition of heat which turns out\nto be largely ambiguous in the case of strong coupling between system and\nenvironment. The general theory of the thermodynamics of open systems, in\nparticular, in view of strong coupling, is reviewed and illustrated with\nseveral examples. The vagueness of heat is discussed in the context of the\nambiguities in the definitions of a fluctuating internal energy and other\nfluctuating thermodynamic potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 16:00:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 12:44:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 15:10:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 20:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Studies of these models\ntypically focus on the moments and the displacement probability density\nfunction. Here we develop the complementary power spectral description for a\nbroad class of random diffusivity processes. In our approach we cater for\ntypical single particle tracking data in which a small number of trajectories\nwith finite duration are garnered. Apart from the diffusing-diffusivity model\nwe study a range of previously unconsidered random diffusivity processes, for\nwhich we obtain exact forms of the probability density function. These new\nprocesses are different versions of jump processes as well as functionals of\nBrownian motion. The resulting behaviour subtly depends on the specific model\ndetails. Thus, the central part of the probability density function may be\nGaussian or non-Gaussian, and the tails may assume Gaussian, exponential,\nlog-normal or even power-law forms. For all these models we derive analytically\nthe moment-generating function for the single-trajectory power spectral\ndensity. We establish the generic $1/f^2$-scaling of the power spectral density\nas function of frequency in all cases. Moreover, we establish the probability\ndensity for the amplitudes of the random power spectral density of individual\ntrajectories. The latter functions reflect the very specific properties of the\ndifferent random diffusivity models considered here. Our exact results are in\nexcellent agreement with extensive numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 16:01:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 09:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

FAN\ncan leverage both paired and unpaired data as we disentangle the features into\nidentity and non-identity components and adapt the distribution of the identity\nfeatures, which breaks the limit of current face super-resolution methods.

The well-known strong Ne and O\nemission lines with Keplerian profiles are shown to arise at the inner edge of\nthe magnetically-channeled accretion disk.

Comparison of the line profiles in HETGS\nobservations from 2000, 2003, and 2010 show that the inner disk radius\ndecreased by a factor of two after the pulsar went from spin-down to spin-up,\nas predicted by magnetic accretion torque theory.

In this work, we present an inverted rear-heterojunction\nGaInP solar cell that employs a thick Te-doped GaInP layer as absorber, with a\ndoping profile obtained exclusively by controlling the memory effect of Te\ncoming from the preceding growth of a heavily doped GaAs contact layer.

In the Hamiltonian case, this\nmodel presents an interesting phase diagram characterized by two quantum\ncriticalities: a superradiant phase transition and a spectral collapse, that\nis, the coalescence of discrete energy levels into a continuous band. Here, we\ninvestigate the effects of both qubit and photon dissipation on the phase\ntransition and on the instability induced by the spectral collapse. Using a\nmean-field decoupling approximation, we analytically obtain the steady-state\nexpectation values of the observables signaling a symmetry breaking,\nidentifying a first-order phase transition from the normal to the superradiant\nphase.

The method radically expands the scope of the input-output\ntheory, which was originally proposed to treat quantum optic problems. Based on\nthe GIOM we derive a Langevin-type equation of motion for molecular operators,\nwhich posses a great generality and accuracy, and permits the derivation of a\nstationary charge current expression involving only two types of transfer\nrates. Furthermore, we devise the so-called \"Polaron Transport in Electronic\nResonance\" (PoTER) approximation, which allows to feasibly simulate electron\ndynamics in generic tight-binding models with strong electron-vibration\ninteractions. For short chains, the charge current reduces to known limits and\nreasonably agrees with exact numerical simulations. For extended junctions the\ncurrent displays a turnover from phonon-assisted to phonon-suppressed\ntransport. Nevertheless, the onset of ohmic behavior requires extensions beyond\nthe PoTER approximation. As an additional application, we consider a\ncavity-coupled molecule junction. Here we identify a cavity-induced suppression\nof charge current in the single-site case, and observe signatures of polariton\nformation in the current-voltage characteristics in the strong light-matter\ncoupling regime. A critical understanding gained from the GIOM-PoTER scheme is\nthat the single-site vibrationally-coupled model is deceptively simpler, and\namenable to approximations than multi-site models. Therefore, benchmarking of\nmethods should not be concluded with the single-site case. The work manifests\nthat the input-output framework, which is normally employed in quantum optics,\ncan serve as a powerful and feasible tool in the realm of electron transport\njunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 17:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

Any excess of heat has to be dissipated in the\nsurrounding environment to prevent overheating. Most of that dissipation occurs\nthrough the skin, but the efficiency of that mechanism decreases with the\nanimal's mass. The role of the other mechanisms for dissipating heat is then\nraised, more particularly the one linked to the lung that forms a much larger\nsurface area than the skin. The dissipation occurring in the lung is however\noften neglected, even though there exists no real knowledge of its dynamics,\nhidden by the complexity of the organ's geometry and of the physics of the\nexchanges. Here we show, based on an original and analytical model of the\nexchanges in the lung, that all mammals, independently of their mass, dissipate\nthrough their lung the same proportion of the heat they produced, about 6-7 %.\nWe found that the heat dissipation in mammals' lung is driven by a number,\nuniversal among mammals, that arises from the dynamics of the temperature of\nthe bronchial mucosa. We propose a scenario to explain how evolution might have\ntuned the lung for heat exchanges. Furthermore, our analysis allows to define\nthe pulmonary heat and water diffusive capacities. We show in the human case\nthat these capacities follow closely the oxygen consumption. Our work lays the\nfoundations for more detailed analysis of the heat exchanges occurring in the\nlung. Future studies should focus on refining our understanding of the\nuniversal number identified. In an ecological framework, our analysis paves the\nway to a better understanding of the mammals' strategies for thermoregulation\nand of the effect of warming environments on mammals' metabolism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 17:10:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Dec 2019 17:27:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

However, analytics workloads are often bursty or low volume,\nleaving clusters idle much of the time, meaning customers pay for compute\nresources even when unused. The ability of cloud function services, such as AWS\nLambda or Azure Functions, to run small, fine granularity tasks make them\nappear to be a natural choice for query processing in such settings. But\nimplementing an analytics system on cloud functions comes with its own set of\nchallenges. These include managing hundreds of tiny stateless\nresource-constrained workers, handling stragglers, and shuffling data through\nopaque cloud services. In this paper we present Starling, a query execution\nengine built on cloud function services that employs number of techniques to\nmitigate these challenges, providing interactive query latency at a lower total\ncost than provisioned systems with low-to-moderate utilization. In particular,\non a 1TB TPC-H dataset in cloud storage, Starling is less expensive than the\nbest provisioned systems for workloads when queries arrive 1 minute apart or\nmore. Starling also has lower latency than competing systems reading from cloud\nobject stores and can scale to larger datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 18:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

In this second paper, we perform simulation validation to\nestimate radiant and velocity accuracy which may be achieved by various meteor\nobservation systems as applied to several meteor showers. For low-resolution\nall-sky systems, where the meteor deceleration is generally not measurable, the\nmulti-parameter fit method assuming a constant velocity better reproduces the\nradiant and speed of synthetic meteors.

Previous work has proposed\nproportionality axioms satisfied by Thiele's rule (now known as Proportional\nApproval Voting, PAV) but not by Phragm\\'en's rule. By proposing two new\nproportionality axioms (laminar proportionality and priceability) satisfied by\nPhragm\\'en but not Thiele, we show that the two rules achieve two distinct\nforms of proportional representation. Phragm\\'en's rule ensures that all voters\nhave a similar amount of influence on the committee, and Thiele's rule ensures\na fair utility distribution.\n  Thiele's rule is a welfarist voting rule (one that maximizes a function of\nvoter utilities).

In this paper we propose a natural explanation for\nthis coincidence. If the early dark energy scalar couples to neutrinos then it\nreceives a large injection of energy around the time that neutrinos become\nnon-relativistic. This is precisely when their temperature is of order their\nmass, which, coincidentally, occurs around the time of matter-radiation\nequality.

In intensive studies, recent GANs\nhave shown promising results for reproducing training images. However, in spite\nof noise, they reproduce images with fidelity. As an alternative, we propose a\nnovel family of GANs called noise robust GANs (NR-GANs), which can learn a\nclean image generator even when training images are noisy. In particular,\nNR-GANs can solve this problem without having complete noise information (e.g.,\nthe noise distribution type, noise amount, or signal-noise relationship). To\nachieve this, we introduce a noise generator and train it along with a clean\nimage generator. However, without any constraints, there is no incentive to\ngenerate an image and noise separately. Therefore, we propose distribution and\ntransformation constraints that encourage the noise generator to capture only\nthe noise-specific components. In particular, considering such constraints\nunder different assumptions, we devise two variants of NR-GANs for\nsignal-independent noise and three variants of NR-GANs for signal-dependent\nnoise. On three benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of NR-GANs\nin noise robust image generation. Furthermore, we show the applicability of\nNR-GANs in image denoising.

The main\nresults are as follows: (a) The flyby fraction increases by up to a factor of\n50 with decreasing halo mass and by up to a factor of 400 with increasing\nlarge-scale density, while the merger fraction does not show any significant\ndependencies on these two parameters; (b) The redshift evolution of the flyby\nfraction is twofold, increasing with redshift at $0<z<1$ and remaining constant\nat $z>1$, while the merger fraction increases monotonically with redshift at\n$z=0\\sim4$; (c) The multiple interactions with two or more neighbors are on\naverage flyby-dominated, and their fraction has a mass and environment\ndependence similar to that for the flyby fraction; (d) Given that flybys\nsubstantially outnumber mergers toward $z=0$ (by a factor of five) and the\nmultiple interactions are flyby-dominated, the flyby's contribution to galactic\nevolution is stronger than ever at the present epoch, especially for less\nmassive halos and in the higher density environment. We propose a scenario that\nconnects the evolution of the flyby and merger fractions to the hierarchical\nstructure formation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

In a radiative\nAuger process, the leftover electrons are in an excited state and a redshifted\nphoton is created. In a semiconductor quantum dot, radiative Auger is predicted\nfor charged excitons. Here we report the observation of radiative Auger on\ntrions in single quantum dots. For a trion, a photon is created on\nelectron-hole recombination, leaving behind a single electron. The radiative\nAuger process promotes this additional (Auger) electron to a higher shell of\nthe quantum dot. We show that the radiative Auger effect is a powerful probe of\nthis single electron: the energy separations between the resonance fluorescence\nand the radiative Auger emission directly measure the single-particle\nsplittings of the electronic states in the quantum dot with high precision. In\nsemiconductors, these single-particle splittings are otherwise hard to access\nby optical means as particles are excited typically in pairs, as excitons.\nAfter the radiative Auger emission, the Auger carrier relaxes back to the\nlowest shell. Going beyond the original theoretical proposals, we show how\napplying quantum optics techniques to the radiative Auger photons gives access\nto the single-electron dynamics, notably relaxation and tunneling. This is also\nhard to access by optical means: even for quasi-resonant $p$-shell excitation,\nelectron relaxation takes place in the presence of a hole, complicating the\nrelaxation dynamics.

Following this goal,\nhere we suggest a method to constrain the cosmological background, and the\nHubble constant in particular, by future observations of gravitationally lensed\nradiation emitted by a single source in both the gravitational wave and the\nelectromagnetic regimes. The lensing of the gravitational wave radiation, in\nfact, can leave a clear imprinting in the corresponding waveform, and we want\nto analyze if such kind of measurements can be successfully employed to better\nconstrain the cosmological background.

The difference between these\nschools of thought is substantial: if a super-scaling effect exists, as\nsuggested by former studies, then as groups grow, their productivity will\nincrease even faster than their size, super-linearly improving their\nefficiency.

Here we report\nthat proton irradiation significantly and repeatably decelerates intergranular\ncorrosion of Ni-Cr alloys in molten fluoride salt at 650C. We demonstrate this\neffect by showing that the depth of intergranular voids resulting from Cr\nleaching into the salt is reduced by the proton irradiation alone. Interstitial\ndefects generated from proton irradiation result in radiation-enhanced\ndiffusion, more rapidly replenishing corrosion-injected vacancies with alloy\nconstituents, thus playing the crucial role in decelerating corrosion. Our\nresults show that in industrially-relevant scenarios irradiation can have a\npositive impact, challenging our view that radiation damage always results in\nnegative effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 19:16:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

We performed experiments in aqueous\nelectrolyte solutions, and our results show that a thermoelectric field appears\ninstantly in the solution as the temperature difference between the electrodes\nstabilizes.

Using this technique,\nwe can easily establish that the non-existence of dynamical matching is a\nconsequence of heteroclinic connections between the unstable manifolds of the\nunstable periodic orbits (UPOs) of the upper index-1 saddles (entrance channels\nto the Caldera) and the stable manifolds of the family of UPOs of the central\nminimum of the Caldera, resulting in the temporary trapping of trajectories.\nMoreover, dynamical matching will occur when there is no heteroclinic\nconnection, which allows trajectories to enter and exit the Caldera without\ninteracting with the shallow region of the central minimum. Knowledge of this\nphase space mechanism is relevant because it allows us to effectively predict\nthe existence, and non-existence, of dynamical matching. In this work we\nexplore a stretched Caldera potential by means of Lagrangian descriptors,\nallowing us to accurately compute the critical value for the stretching\nparameter for which dynamical matching behavior occurs in the system. This\napproach is shown to provide a tremendous advantage for exploring this\nmechanism in comparison to other methods from nonlinear dynamics that use phase\nspace dividing surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 20:04:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 17:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

In this paper we\nqualitatively describe the asteroseismic signature of a large active region in\nthe power spectrum of the dipole and quadrupole p modes. In the corotating\nframe of the active region, the perturbations due to (differential) rotation\nand the active region completely lift the $(2\\ell + 1)$-fold azimuthal\ndegeneracy of the frequency spectrum of modes with harmonic degree $\\ell$. In\nthe frame of the observer, the unsteady nature of the perturbation leads to the\nappearance of $(2\\ell+1)^2$ peaks in the power spectrum of a multiplet. These\npeaks blend into each other to form asymmetric line profiles. In the limit of a\nsmall active region, we approximate the power spectrum of a multiplet in terms\nof $2\\times(2\\ell+1)$ peaks, whose amplitudes and frequencies depend on the\nlatitude of the active region and the inclination angle of the star's rotation\naxis.

Here, applications can\nrequire a rapid shift from one object instance to another, thus requiring fast\nturnaround which affords little-to-no training time. What is more, gathering a\ndataset and training a model for every new object instance to be detected can\nbe an expensive and time-consuming process. In this context, we propose a\ngeneric 2D object instance detection approach that uses example viewpoints of\nthe target object at test time to retrieve its 2D location in RGB images,\nwithout requiring any additional training (i.e. fine-tuning) step. To this end,\nwe present an end-to-end architecture that extracts global and local\ninformation of the object from its viewpoints. The global information is used\nto tune early filters in the backbone while local viewpoints are correlated\nwith the input image. Our method offers an improvement of almost 30 mAP over\nthe previous template matching methods on the challenging Occluded Linemod\ndataset (overall mAP of 50.7).

The original method was adapted by Takeuti, Titani, Kozawa\nand Ozawa to lattice-valued models of set theory. After this, L\\\"{o}we and\nTarafder proposed a class of algebras based on a certain kind of implication\nwhich satisfy several axioms of ZF. From this class, they found a specific\n3-valued model called PS3 which satisfies all the axioms of ZF, and can be\nexpanded with a paraconsistent negation *, thus obtaining a paraconsistent\nmodel of ZF. The logic (PS3 ,*) coincides (up to language) with da Costa and\nD'Ottaviano logic J3, a 3-valued paraconsistent logic that have been proposed\nindependently in the literature by several authors and with different\nmotivations such as CluNs, LFI1 and MPT. We propose in this paper a family of\nalgebraic models of ZFC based on LPT0, another linguistic variant of J3\nintroduced by us in 2016. The semantics of LPT0, as well as of its first-order\nversion QLPT0, is given by twist structures defined over Boolean agebras. From\nthis, it is possible to adapt the standard Boolean-valued models of (classical)\nZFC to twist-valued models of an expansion of ZFC by adding a paraconsistent\nnegation. We argue that the implication operator of LPT0 is more suitable for a\nparaconsistent set theory than the implication of PS3, since it allows for\ngenuinely inconsistent sets w such that [(w = w)] = 1/2 . This implication is\nnot a 'reasonable implication' as defined by L\\\"{o}we and Tarafder. This\nsuggests that 'reasonable implication algebras' are just one way to define a\nparaconsistent set theory. Our twist-valued models are adapted to provide a\nclass of twist-valued models for (PS3,*), thus generalizing L\\\"{o}we and\nTarafder result.

We have shown\nthat if heavy mediators were produced on-shell within a period of entropy\nproduction in the early universe, as in the post-inflationary reheating, the DM\nrelic density may be enhanced by many orders of magnitude relative to the usual\ninstantaneous reheating approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 21:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-28"}

Tissue temperature must be efficiently and accurately obtained from\ndeformed tissues for precise thermal energy delivery; however, the classical\nPennes bio-heat transfer can handle only the static non-moving state of soft\ntissue. This paper presents a formulation of bio-heat transfer under the effect\nof tissue deformation for fast or near real-time tissue temperature\ncomputation, based on fast explicit dynamics finite element algorithm for\ntransient heat transfer. The proposed computation is achieved by transformation\nof the unknown deformed tissue state to the known initial non-moving state via\na mapping function. The appropriateness and effectiveness of the proposed\nmethodology are evaluated on a realistic virtual human liver with blood vessels\nto demonstrate a clinically relevant scenario of thermal ablation of hepatic\ncancer. Compared against the established non-linear procedures from commercial\nfinite element analysis package, ABAQUS/CAE, the proposed methodology can\nachieve a typical 1.0e-3 level of normalized relative error at nodes and\nbetween 1.0e-4 and 1.0e-5 level of total errors, which is in good agreement\nwith ABAQUS solutions. The proposed method consumes slightly more time than the\nformulation without soft tissue deformation, and computation performance of\nfive different formulations are examined. The proposed method can be applied\nwith bio-mechanical deformable models for fast or near real-time computation of\nnon-linear bio-heat transfer, leading to translational potential in dynamic\ntissue temperature predictive analysis and thermal dosimetry computation for\ncomputer-integrated medical education and personalized treatments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 21:45:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2021 03:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

The objective of this work is to determine the\nsafe range of input power density to detach the magnet without causing thermal\ntrauma in the ear, and to analyze the effectiveness of natural convection with\nrespect to conduction for removing the excess heat.

Most prior works\nadopt a selective attention mechanism over sentences in a bag to denoise from\nwrongly labeled data, which however could be incompetent when there is only one\nsentence in a bag. In this paper, we propose a brand-new light-weight neural\nframework to address the distantly supervised relation extraction problem and\nalleviate the defects in previous selective attention framework. Specifically,\nin the proposed framework, 1) we use an entity-aware word embedding method to\nintegrate both relative position information and head/tail entity embeddings,\naiming to highlight the essence of entities for this task; 2) we develop a\nself-attention mechanism to capture the rich contextual dependencies as a\ncomplement for local dependencies captured by piecewise CNN; and 3) instead of\nusing selective attention, we design a pooling-equipped gate, which is based on\nrich contextual representations, as an aggregator to generate bag-level\nrepresentation for final relation classification. Compared to selective\nattention, one major advantage of the proposed gating mechanism is that, it\nperforms stably and promisingly even if only one sentence appears in a bag and\nthus keeps the consistency across all training examples.

These operators have desirable special properties that\nalso change the computational considerations in such a way that undermines\ntraditional methods and makes certain other approaches more appealing. We have\ndeveloped a scalable framework for solving fractional diffusion equations using\none such method, specifically the method of eigenfunction expansion. In this\npaper, we will discuss the specific parallelization strategies used to\nefficiently compute the full set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a\ndiscretized Laplace eigenvalue problem and apply them to construct approximate\nsolutions to our fractional order model problems.

Specifically, the knowledge library of L2SC contains two components:\n1) orthogonal basis library: capturing latent cluster centers among the\nclusters in each pair of tasks; 2) feature embedding library: embedding the\nfeature manifold information shared among multiple related tasks. As a new\nspectral clustering task arrives, L2SC firstly transfers knowledge from both\nbasis library and feature library to obtain encoding matrix, and further\nredefines the library base over time to maximize performance across all the\nclustering tasks. Meanwhile, a general online update formulation is derived to\nalternatively update the basis library and feature library. Finally, the\nempirical experiments on several real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nour L2SC model can effectively improve the clustering performance when\ncomparing with other state-of-the-art spectral clustering algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 01:37:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 04:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-02"}

Earlier studies consider highly\nidealised dynamical friction, but neglect the effects of dynamical mass loss.\nWe show the latter process to be important using mutually consistent orbit\nintegration and N-body simulations. Following this approach we find an orbital\nsolution that brings these galaxies to within ~50 kpc of each other in the\npast, ~6.5 Gyr ago.

In contrast, the M31-M33 HI\nfilament is likely a fossil structure dating back to the time of the ancient\nencounter between these galaxies. Similarly, the observed outer disc warp in\nM33 may well be a relic of this past event. Our model suggests the presence of\na tidally induced gas envelope around these galaxies, and the existence of a\ndiffuse gas stream, the 'Triangulum stream', stretching for tens of kpc from\nM33 away from M31.

Hence, we present a collection of cases at\nseveral Mach numbers with different heat-flux values applied at the impingement\nwall. The wall temperature scales linearly with the imposed heat-flux and the\nadiabatic wall temperature is found to be purely governed by the flow\ncompression. Especially for high heat-flux values, the non-constant wall\ntemperature induces considerable differences in the thermal conductivity of the\nfluid. This phenomenon has to date not been discussed and it strongly modulates\nthe Nusselt number. In contrast, the heat transfer coefficient is independent\nof the varying thermal properties of the fluid and the wall heat-flux.\nFurthermore, we introduce the impingement efficiency, which highlights the\nareas of the wall where the temperature is influenced by compressibility\neffects. This parameter shows how the contribution of the flow compression to\nraising the wall temperature becomes more dominant as the heat-flux decreases.\nThus, knowing the adiabatic wall temperature is indispensable for obtaining the\ncorrect heat transfer coefficient when low heat-flux values are used, even at\nlow Mach numbers. Lastly, a detailed analysis of the dilatation field also\nshows how the compressibility effects only affect the heat transfer in the\nvicinity of the stagnation point. These compressibility effects decay rapidly\nfurther away from the flow impingement, and the density changes along the\ndeveloping boundary layer are caused instead by variable inertia effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 02:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-28"}

However, using the current deep neural network\nmodels, the implementation of fictitious play faces crucial challenges. Neural\nnetwork model training employs gradient descent approaches to update all\nconnection weights, and thus is easy to forget the old opponents after training\nto beat the new opponents. Existing approaches often maintain a pool of\nhistorical policy models to avoid the forgetting. However, learning to beat a\npool in stochastic games, i.e., a wide distribution over policy models, is\neither sample-consuming or insufficient to exploit all models with limited\namount of samples. In this paper, we propose a learning process with neural\nfictitious play to alleviate the above issues. We train a single model as our\npolicy model, which consists of sub-models and a selector. Everytime facing a\nnew opponent, the model is expanded by adding a new sub-model, where only the\nnew sub-model is updated instead of the whole model. At the same time, the\nselector is also updated to mix up the new sub-model with the previous ones at\nthe state-level, so that the model is maintained as a behavior strategy instead\nof a wide distribution over policy models. Experiments on Kuhn poker, a\ngrid-world Treasure Hunting game, and Mini-RTS environments show that the\nproposed approach alleviates the forgetting problem, and consequently improves\nthe learning efficiency and the robustness of neural fictitious play.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 03:14:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 04:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-02"}

It combines approximations at different levels of accuracy using a\nhierarchy of meshes in a similar way as multigrid. The generation of\nbody-fitted mesh hierarchies is only possible for simple geometries. On top of\nthat, MLMC for random domains involves the generation of a mesh for every\nsample. Instead, here we consider the use of embedded methods which make use of\nsimple background meshes of an artificial domain (a bounding-box) for which it\nis easy to define a mesh hierarchy, thus eliminating the need of body-fitted\nunstructured meshes, but can produce ill-conditioned discrete problems.

The race-DC applies to various\ntypes of biased estimators, which include but are not limited to Lasso\nestimator, Ridge estimator and principal component estimator in linear\nregression, and least squares estimator in nonlinear regression. The resulting\nglobal estimator is strictly unbiased under linear model, and is acceleratingly\nbias-reduced in nonlinear model, and can achieve the theoretical optimality,\nfor the case when the number of batches of data is large. Moreover, the race-DC\nis computationally simple because it is a least squares estimator in a pro\nforma linear regression.

Previous\nlearning-based MVS methods estimate per-view depth using plane sweep volumes\nwith a fixed depth hypothesis at each plane; this generally requires densely\nsampled planes for desired accuracy, and it is very hard to achieve\nhigh-resolution depth. In contrast, we propose adaptive thin volumes (ATVs); in\nan ATV, the depth hypothesis of each plane is spatially varying, which adapts\nto the uncertainties of previous per-pixel depth predictions. Our UCS-Net has\nthree stages: the first stage processes a small standard plane sweep volume to\npredict low-resolution depth; two ATVs are then used in the following stages to\nrefine the depth with higher resolution and higher accuracy. Our ATV consists\nof only a small number of planes; yet, it efficiently partitions local depth\nranges within learned small intervals. In particular, we propose to use\nvariance-based uncertainty estimates to adaptively construct ATVs; this\ndifferentiable process introduces reasonable and fine-grained spatial\npartitioning. Our multi-stage framework progressively subdivides the vast scene\nspace with increasing depth resolution and precision, which enables scene\nreconstruction with high completeness and accuracy in a coarse-to-fine fashion.\nWe demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared with\nstate-of-the-art benchmarks on various challenging datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:14:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Apr 2020 23:09:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

In this\npaper, we propose a non-autoregressive decoding based model with a\ncoarse-to-fine captioning procedure to alleviate these defects. In\nimplementations, we employ a bi-directional self-attention based network as our\nlanguage model for achieving inference speedup, based on which we decompose the\ncaptioning procedure into two stages, where the model has different focuses.\nSpecifically, given that visual words determine the semantic correctness of\ncaptions, we design a mechanism of generating visual words to not only promote\nthe training of scene-related words but also capture relevant details from\nvideos to construct a coarse-grained sentence \"template\". Thereafter, we devise\ndedicated decoding algorithms that fill in the \"template\" with suitable words\nand modify inappropriate phrasing via iterative refinement to obtain a\nfine-grained description. Extensive experiments on two mainstream video\ncaptioning benchmarks, i.e., MSVD and MSR-VTT, demonstrate that our approach\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, generates diverse descriptions, and\nobtains high inference efficiency.

Under the SAR\nscheme, only the subscribers of the operators' data plans are eligible for the\nrewards; under the SUR scheme, all users are eligible for the rewards (e.g.,\nthe users who do not subscribe to the data plans can still get SIM cards and\nreceive data rewards by watching ads).

We further show\nthat the operator's optimal choice between the two schemes is sensitive to the\nusers' data consumption utility function and the operator's network capacity.\nWe provide some counter-intuitive insights.

Due to the continuity of target trajectories, tracking systems usually\nrestrict their data association within a local neighborhood. In single camera\ntracking, local neighborhood refers to consecutive frames; in multi-camera\ntracking, it refers to neighboring cameras that the target may appear\nsuccessively. For similarity estimation, tracking systems often adopt\nappearance features learned from the re-identification (re-ID) perspective.\nDifferent from tracking, re-ID usually does not have access to the trajectory\ncues that can limit the search space to a local neighborhood. Due to its global\nmatching property, the re-ID perspective requires to learn global appearance\nfeatures. We argue that the mismatch between the local matching procedure in\ntracking and the global nature of re-ID appearance features may compromise\nMTMCT performance.\n  To fit the local matching procedure in MTMCT, in this work, we introduce\nlocality aware appearance metric (LAAM). Specifically, we design an\nintra-camera metric for single camera tracking, and an inter-camera metric for\nmulti-camera tracking. Both metrics are trained with data pairs sampled from\ntheir corresponding local neighborhoods, as opposed to global sampling in the\nre-ID perspective. We show that the locally learned metrics can be successfully\napplied on top of several globally learned re-ID features. With the proposed\nmethod, we report new state-of-the-art performance on the DukeMTMC dataset, and\na substantial improvement on the CityFlow dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 09:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-28"}

Starting from the prior knowledge of the human body hierarchical\nstructure, we devise a graph pyramid module (GPM) by stacking three levels of\ngraph structures from coarse granularity to fine granularity subsequently.

Therefore, this approach can\npotentially be used in J-PET tomograph which is build from plastic\nscintillators characterized by fast light signals. The drawback in adopting\nthis technique is lying in the non-linear correlation between input energy loss\nand TOT of the signal. The main motivation behind this work is to develop the\nrelationship between TOT and energy loss and validate it with the J-PET\ntomograph.\n  The experiment was performed using the $^{22}$Na beta emitter source placed\nin the center of the J-PET tomograph. One can obtain primary photons of two\ndifferent energies: 511 keV photon from the annihilation of positron (direct\nannihilation or through the formation of para-Positronim atom or pick-off\nprocess of ortho-Positronium atoms), and 1275 keV prompt photon. This allows to\nstudy the correlation between TOT values and energy loss for energy range up to\n1000 keV. As the photon interacts dominantly via Compton scattering inside the\nplastic scintillator, there is no direct information of primary photon energy.\nHowever, using the J-PET geometry one can measure the scattering angle of the\ninteracting photon. Since, $^{22}$Na source emits photons of two different\nenergies, it is required to know unambiguously the energy of incident photons\nand its corresponding scattering angle for the estimation of energy deposition.\nIn this work, the relationship between Time Over Threshold and energy loss by\ninteracting photons inside the plastic scintillators used in J-PET scanner is\nestablished for a energy deposited range 100-1000 keV\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 10:23:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-28"}

We present an autonomous\nnavigation system capable of operating in dense crowds and utilizing\ninformation of social groups. The underlying system incorporates a deep neural\nnetwork to track social groups and join the flow of a social group in\nfacilitating the navigation. A collision avoidance layer in the system further\nensures navigation safety. In experiments, our method generates socially\ncompliant behaviors as state-of-the-art methods.

Another\nchallenging aspect is that parameters governing the performance of various\noperations tend to drift over time, and monitoring these is hence a difficult\ntask. One of the most promising characterization techniques, gate set\ntomography (GST), provides a self-consistent estimate of the completely\npositive, trace-preserving (CPTP) maps for a complete set of gates, as well as\npreparation and measurement operators. We develop a method for performance\noptimization seeded by tomography (POST), which couples the power of GST with a\nclassical optimization routine to achieve a consistent gate improvement in just\na short number of steps within a given calibration cycle. By construction, the\nPOST procedure finds the best available gate operation given the hardware, and\nis therefore robust to the effects of drift. Further, in comparison to other\nquantum error mitigation techniques, it builds upon a one-time application of\nGST. To demonstrate the performance of this method on a real quantum computer,\nwe map out the operations of six qubit pairs on the superconducting\n\\emph{ibmq\\_poughkeepsie} quantum device.

Since the 1970s, the convention has been\nto build up the theory of both core and quotients with the abacus construction,\nfirst introduced by G. James. In this paper we return to the earlier point of\nview. First we show that, for any positive integer t, the t-core and t-quotient\nof an integer partition can be directly obtained from its Frobenius symbol. The\nargument also works in the opposite direction: that is, given the Frobenius\nsymbol of a t-core and a $t$-tuple of Frobenius symbols, one can recover the\nFrobenius symbol of the corresponding partition. One immediate application is\nthe calculation of the Durfee number of the associated partition from the\nFrobenius symbols of the core and quotient. In 1991, J. Scopes gathered\ntogether the $p$-core partitions into families to prove that Donovan's\nconjecture holds for the symmetric groups at the prime p. We describe, using\nour methods, the action of the affine Weyl group W_p of type $A$ on Frobenius\nsymbols, and use this to parametrize and compute the explicit number of Scopes\nfamilies. In particular we enumerate both the infinite and finite Scopes\nfamilies. Core partitions have also attracted recent interest in number theory.\nBy constructing explicit and combinatorial bijections, we revisit some\nwell-known identities originally obtained using sophisticated methods. We end\nwith a close study of the relationship between certain hooks in the quotient\nand certain hooks in the associated partition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 11:59:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-28"}

Furthermore, the models learn from\nartificial datasets, often with bias or contaminated discriminating content.\nThrough their increased distribution, decision-making algorithms can contribute\npromoting prejudge and unfairness which is not easy to notice due to lack of\ntransparency. Hence, scientists developed several so-called explanators or\nexplainers which try to point out the connection between input and output to\nrepresent in a simplified way the inner structure of machine learning black\nboxes. In this survey we differ the mechanisms and properties of explaining\nsystems for Deep Neural Networks for Computer Vision tasks.

The unique map from the curve object to a dynamical\nsystem is a solution of the system, and a dynamical system is said to be\ncomplete when for all initial conditions there is a solution. A subtle issue\nconcerns the question of when a dynamical system is complete, and the paper\nprovides abstract conditions for this.\n  This abstract formulation also allows new perspectives on topics such as\ncommutative vector fields and flows. In addition, the stronger notion of a\ndifferential curve object, which is the centrepiece of the last section of the\npaper, has exponential maps and forms a differential exponential rig.

Mathematical modelling is a key tool in predicting where and how\nthese new threats will spread, as well as in assessing how damaging they might\nbe. Models can also be used to inform disease management, providing a rational\nmethodology for comparing the performance of possible control strategies\nagainst one another. For emerging epidemics, in which new pathogens or pathogen\nstrains are actively spreading into new regions, the spatial component of\nspread becomes particularly important, both to make predictions and to optimise\ndisease control. In this chapter we illustrate how the spatial spread of\nemerging plant diseases can be modelled at the landscape scale via spatially\nexplicit compartmental models. Our particular focus is on the crucial role of\nthe dispersal kernel-which parameterises the probability of pathogen spread\nfrom an infected host to susceptible hosts at any given distance-in determining\noutcomes of epidemics. We add disease management to our model by testing\nperformance of a simple ''one off'' form of reactive disease control, in which\nsites within a particular distance of locations detected to contain infection\nare removed in a single round of disease management. We use this simplified\nmodel to show how ostensibly arcane decisions made by the modeller-most notably\nwhether or not the underpinning disease model allows for stochasticity (i.e.\nrandomness)-can greatly impact on disease management recommendations.

The main\ncontribution arises from the dipole due to the adsorption-induced charge\nrearrangement at the interface. Our work reveals a pronounced odd-even effect,\nwhich can be traced back to the dipole moment of the PEG(thiol) layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 14:11:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 22:56:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-21"}

The\ndiscovery of broad permitted lines in the polarized spectrum of type 2 Seyfert\ngalaxies in the mid 80's led to the idea of an obscuring torus, whose\norientation with respect to our line of sight was the reason of the different\noptical spectra. However, after many years of observations with different\ntechniques, including IR and mm interferometry, the resulting properties of the\nobserved dust structures differ from the torus model that would be needed to\nexplain the type 1 vs type 2 dichotomy. Moreover, in the last years,\nmulti-frequency monitoring of active galactic nuclei has shown an increasing\nnumber of transitions from one type to the other one, which cannot be explained\nin terms of the simple orientation of the dusty structure surrounding the\nactive galactic nucleus (AGN). The interrelations between the AGN and the host\ngalaxy, as also shown in the Magorrian relation, suggest that the evolution of\nthe host galaxy may also have an important role in the observed manifestation\nof the nuclei. As an example, the observed delay between the maximum star\nformation activity and the onset of the AGN activity, and the higher occurrence\nof type 2 nuclei in star forming galaxies, have suggested the possible\nevolutionary path from, e.g., HII $\\rightarrow$ AGN2 $\\rightarrow$ AGN1.

Forward search algorithms typically rely on a single, relatively\nsimple variation of best-first search and remain fixed throughout the process\nof solving a planning problem. Existing work combining multiple search\ntechniques usually aims at supporting best-first search with an additional\nexploratory mechanism, triggered using a handcrafted criterion. A notable\nexception is very recent work which combines various search techniques using a\ntrainable policy. It is, however, confined to a discrete action space\ncomprising several fixed subroutines.\n  In this paper, we introduce a parametrized search algorithm template which\ncombines various search techniques within a single routine. The template's\nparameter space defines an infinite space of search algorithms, including,\namong others, BFS, local and random search. We further introduce a neural\narchitecture for designating the values of the search parameters given the\nstate of the search. This enables expressing neural search policies that change\nthe values of the parameters as the search progresses. The policies can be\nlearned automatically, with the objective of maximizing the planner's\nperformance on a given distribution of planning problems.

The specifications required to operate a NB system on\nDEMO are very demanding: the system has to provide plasma heating, current\ndrive and plasma control at a very high level of power (up to 150 MW) and\nenergy (1 or 2 MeV), including high performances in term of wall-plug\nefficiency ($\\eta$ > 60%), high availability and reliability. To this aim, a\nnovel NB concept based on the photodetachment of the energetic negative ion\nbeam is under study. The keystone of this new concept is the achievement of a\nphotoneutralizer where a high power photon flux (~3 MW) generated within a\nFabry Perot cavity will overlap, cross and partially photodetach the intense\nnegative ion beam accelerated at high energy (1 or 2 MeV). The aspect ratio of\nthe beam-line (source, accelerator, etc.) is specifically designed to maximize\nthe overlap of the photon beam with the ion beam. It is shown that such a\nphotoneutralized based NB system would have the capability to provide several\ntens of MW of D 0 per beam line with a wall-plug efficiency higher than 60%. A\nfeasibility study of the concept has been launched between different\nlaboratories to address the different physics aspects, i.e., negative ion\nsource, plasma modelling, ion accelerator simulation, photoneutralization and\nhigh voltage holding under vacuum.

When 'Oumuamua\ntravels in interstellar space, it keeps colliding with interstellar medium\n(ISM). Given a sufficiently long interaction time, its rotation state may\nchange significantly because of the angular momentum transfer with interstellar\nmedium. Using generated Gaussian random spheres with the dimension ratios 6:1:1\nand 5:5:1, this paper explores the ISM torque curve and proposes that ISM\ncollision may account for 'Oumuamua's tumbling with the simple constant-torque\nanalytical method. The statistic results show that the asymptotic obliquities\ndistribute mostly at 0 and 180 degree and most cases spin down at the\nasymptotic obliquity, indicating the ISM collision effect is similar to the\nYORP effect with zero heat conductivity assumed. Given a long time of\ndeceleration of the spin rate, an initial major-axis rotation may evolve into\ntumbling motion under ISM torque.

The commutator-free Runge-Kutta (RK) exponential integrators\n(EI) were proposed by Celledoni, et al. (FGCS, 2003). In the nonlinear\ntransport setting, the RKEI can be used to decompose the evolution of the\nnonlinear transport into a composition of a sequence of linearized dynamics.\nThe resulting linearized transport equations can be solved by the\nsemi-Lagrangian (SL) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method proposed in Cai, et al.\n(JSC, 2017). The proposed method can achieve high order spatial accuracy via\nthe SLDG framework, and high order temporal accuracy via the RK EI. Due to the\nSL nature, the proposed SLDG-RKEI method is not subject to the CFL condition,\nthus they have the potential in using larger time-stepping sizes than those in\nthe Eulerian approach. Inheriting advantages from the SLDG method, the proposed\nSLDG-RKEI schemes are mass conservative, positivity-preserving, have no\ndimensional splitting error, perform well in resolving complex solution\nstructures, and can be evolved with adaptive time-stepping sizes. We show the\nperformance of the SLDG-RKEI algorithm by classical test problems for the\nnonlinear Vlasov-Poisson system, as well as the Guiding center Vlasov model.\nThough that it is not our focus of this paper to explore the SLDG-RKEI scheme\nfor nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws that develop shocks, we show some\npreliminary results on schemes' performance on the Burgers' equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 15:42:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 15:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

The first and largest of these investigates\nthe possibility that the neutrinos seen by IceCube are produced by sources\nobscured by matter.

For a young\nblack hole, these operators can be taken to act only on the degrees of freedom\nin the black hole region: the soft---or stretched horizon---modes as well as\nthe semiclassical modes in the zone region. On the other hand, for an old black\nhole, the operators must also involve radiation emitted earlier; the difference\nbetween the two cases comes from statistics associated with the coarse-graining\nperformed to obtain the effective theory of the interior.

However, the scheduling exploration space\nenlarges rapidly with the increasing server resources, making the schedulers\nhardly provide ideal solutions quickly. More importantly, we observe that there\nare \"resource cliffs\" in the scheduling exploration space. They affect the\nexploration efficiency and always lead to severe QoS fluctuations. Resource\ncliffs cannot be easily avoided in previous schedulers. To address these\nproblems, we propose a novel ML-based intelligent scheduler - OSML. It learns\nthe correlation between architectural hints (e.g., IPC, cache misses, memory\nfootprint, etc.), scheduling solutions and the QoS demands based on a data set\nwe collected from 11 widely deployed services running on off-the-shelf servers.\nOSML employs multiple ML models to work collaboratively to predict QoS\nvariations, shepherd the scheduling, and recover from QoS violations in\ncomplicated co-location cases. OSML can intelligently avoid resource cliffs\nduring scheduling and reach an optimal solution much faster than previous\napproaches for co-located LC services.

Attention mechanisms have been\nat the forefront in order to learn contextual sentence representations. Current\nstate-of-the-art approaches for many NLP tasks use large pre-trained language\nmodels such as BERT, XLNet and so on for learning representations. These models\nare based on the Transformer architecture that involves recurrent blocks of\ncomputation consisting of multi-head self-attention and feedforward networks.\nOne of the major bottlenecks largely contributing to the computational\ncomplexity of the Transformer models is the self-attention layer, that is both\ncomputationally expensive and parameter intensive. In this work, we introduce a\nnovel multi-head self-attention mechanism operating on GRUs that is shown to be\ncomputationally cheaper and more parameter efficient than self-attention\nmechanism proposed in Transformers for text classification tasks. The\nefficiency of our approach mainly stems from two optimizations; 1) we use\nlow-rank matrix factorization of the affinity matrix to efficiently get\nmultiple attention distributions instead of having separate parameters for each\nhead 2) attention scores are obtained by querying a global context vector\ninstead of densely querying all the words in the sentence.
