Hence, many\nskeleton-based action recognition and segmentation (SBARS) algorithms benefit\nfrom them in their designs. However, a shortcoming of such applications is the\ngeneral lack of spatial relationships between the input features in such data\ntypes. Besides, non-uniform temporal scalings is a common issue in\nskeleton-based data streams which leads to having different input sizes even\nwithin one specific action category. In this work, we propose a novel\ndeep-aligned convolutional neural network (DACNN) to tackle the above\nchallenges for the particular problem of SBARS. Our network is designed by\nintroducing a new type of filters in the context of CNNs which are trained\nbased on their alignments to the local subsequences in the inputs. These\nfilters result in efficient predictions as well as learning interpretable\npatterns in the data. We empirically evaluate our framework on real-world\nbenchmarks showing that the proposed DACNN algorithm obtains a competitive\nperformance compared to the state-of-the-art while benefiting from a less\ncomplicated yet more interpretable model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

However,\nexisting GCN based methods have two main drawbacks. First, to increase the\nreceptive field and improve the representation capability of GCNs, larger\nkernels or deeper network architectures are used, which greatly increases the\ncomputational complexity and the number of parameters. Second, methods working\non higher order graphs computed directly from adjacency matrices may alter the\nrelationship between graph nodes, particularly for weighted graphs. In\naddition, the direct construction of higher-order graphs introduces redundant\ninformation, which may result in lower network performance. To address the\nabove weaknesses, in this paper, we propose a new method of multi-hop\nconvolutional network on weighted graphs. The proposed method consists of\nmultiple convolutional branches, where each branch extracts node representation\nfrom a $k$-hop graph with small kernels. Such design systematically aggregates\nmulti-scale contextual information without adding redundant information.\nFurthermore, to efficiently combine the extracted information from the\nmulti-hop branches, an adaptive weight computation (AWC) layer is proposed.

Our approach follows a recipe analogous to XMS-CASPT2 to\nensure approximate invariance under unitary transformations of the model states\nand a dynamical weighting scheme to smoothly interpolate the Fock operator\nbetween a state-specific and a state-average regime. The resulting extended\ndynamically weighted CASPT2 (XDW-CASPT2) methodology possesses the most\ndesirable features of both MS-CASPT2 and XMS-CASPT2, i.e. the ability to\nprovide accurate transition energies and correctly describe avoided crossings\nand conical intersections.

Although schemes have been demonstrated in\nexternal-field-free SOT switching of a perpendicular layer, practically\nintegrating them with perpendicular MTJs still appears to be challenging. Here,\nwe present experimental demonstration of spin-orbit torques (SOTs) switching a\nperpendicular magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) device without applying an\nexternal magnetic field. An Ir layer is used to serve dual-purpose of both\ninjecting the pure spin current via spin Hall effect and mediating an in-plane\nexchange field to the perpendicular free layer of the MTJ. Robust field-free\nSOT switching with pulsed write path current is demonstrated for various MTJ\nsizes ranging from 50 nm to 500 nm. The effect of MTJ size and pulse width on\nthe critical switching current is studied. Combined micromagnetic simulations\nare carried out to provide in-depth analysis of the switching dynamics as well\nas the thermal effect on the switching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-25"}

We perform two analyses of MASCARA-4 b\nusing a stellar gravity-darkened model. First, we measure MASCARA-4 b's\nmisaligned orbital configuration by modeling its \\tess~photometric light curve.\nWe take advantage of the asymmetry in MASCARA-4 b's transit due to its host\nstar's gravity-darkened surface to measure MASCARA-4 b's true spin-orbit angle\nto be $104^{\\circ+7^\\circ}_{-13^\\circ}$.

Second, we model MASCARA-4 b's insolation including\ngravity-darkening and find that the planet's received XUV flux varies by $4$\\%\nthroughout its orbit. MASCARA-4 b's short-period, polar orbit suggests that the\nplanet likely underwent dramatic orbital evolution to end up in its present-day\nconfiguration and that it receives a varying stellar irradiance that\nperpetually forces the planet out of thermal equilibrium. These findings make\nMASCARA-4 b an excellent target for follow-up characterization to better\nunderstand orbital evolution and current-day of planets around high-mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 17:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

Using sensitive low-surface-brightness observations of CO(1-0) with\nthe Very Large Array, we trace the cold molecular gas in the inner 150 kpc of\nthe MAMMOTH-I Nebula. CO is found in four regions that are associated with\neither galaxies or groups of galaxies that lie inside the nebula.

Whether such IMFs also exist in old dense\nstellar systems like globular clusters is difficult to constrain, because\nmassive stars already became black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs).\nHowever, studies of stellar dynamics find that BHs/NSs influence the long-term\nevolution of star clusters. Following Breen & Heggie (2013) and by carrying out\ntwo-component $N$-body simulations, we demonstrate how this dynamical impact\nconnects with the shape of IMFs. By investigating the energy balance between\nthe BH subsystem and the global, we find that to properly describe the\nevolution of clusters, a corrected two-body relaxation time, $T_{rh,p} =\nT_{rh}/\\psi$, is necessary. Because $\\psi$ depends on the total mass fraction\nof BHs, $M_2 / M$, and the mass ratio, $m_2 / m_1$, the cluster dissolution\ntime is sensitive to the property of BHs or IMFs. Especially, the escape rate\nof BHs via ejections from few-body encounters is linked to mass segregation. In\nstrong tidal fields, top-heavy IMFs easily lead to the fast dissolution of star\nclusters and the formation of BH-dominant dark clusters, which suggests that\nthe observed massive GCs with dense cores are unlikely to have extreme\ntop-heavy IMFs. With the future observations of gravitational waves providing\nunique information of BHs/NSs, it is possible to combine the multi-message\nobservations to have better constrains on the IMFs of old star clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

For clouds defined by a\ndensity threshold n_H,min , the average virial parameter decreases, and the\nfraction of material that is genuinely bound increases, at higher n_H,min.\nSurprisingly, these clouds can be unbound even when alpha_v < 2, and high mass\nclouds (10^4 - 10^6 M_solar) are generally unbound.

A drawback of such a scheme is that, while one core\ngives up LLC resources for another core, the performance drop must be\ncompensated by a higher VF setting which leads to a quadratic increase in\nenergy consumption. By allowing each core to be adapted to exploit instruction\nand memory-level parallelism (ILP/MLP), substantially higher energy savings are\nenabled.\n  This paper proposes a coordinated RM for LLC partitioning, processor\nadaptation, and per-core VF scaling.

If patients at very low risk could be identified based on\nindividualized, image-based biomarkers, the health care resources could be more\nefficiently allocated to higher risk patients and reduce overall exposure to\nionizing radiation.

Planetesimal\ncompositions are modelled assuming parent bodies that differentiated into core,\nmantle and crust components. Atmospheric levels of Ca, Mg and Fe in the model\nare compared to a sample of 230 DZ white dwarfs for which such pollution is\nmeasured. A good fit is obtained when each planetesimal has its core, mantle\nand crust fractions chosen independently from logit-normal distributions which\nlead to average mass fractions of $f_\\text{Cru}=0.15$, $f_\\text{Man}=0.49$ and\n$f_\\text{Cor}=0.36$.

This depletion is unlikely to originate in\nplanetesimal formation processes, but might occur from heating while the star\nis on the giant branch. Alternatively the accreted material has stellar\nabundance, and either the inferred low Mg abundance was caused by an incorrect\nassumption that Mg sinks slower than Ca and Fe, or there are unmodelled biases\nin the observed sample.

It is therefore not unlikely that, well\nafter the initial cloud collapse event which produced the star, it will\nencounter one or more low mass cloud fragments, which we call \"cloudlets\" to\ndistinguish them from full-fledged molecular clouds. Some of this cloudlet\nmaterial may accrete onto the star+disk system, while other material may fly by\nin a hyperbolic orbit. In contrast to the original cloud collapse event, this\nprocess will be a \"cloudlet flyby\" and/or \"cloudlet capture\" event: A\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton type accretion event, driven by the relative velocity\nbetween the star and the cloudlet.

Well\nunderstanding this competition and coordinating their route choices help\nmitigate urban traffic congestion. Even though existing studies have developed\nsuch mechanisms (e.g., the CRM [1]), we still lack the quantitative method to\nevaluate the coordination penitential and identify proper coordination groups\n(CG) to implement the CRM. Thus, they hit prohibitive computing difficulty when\nimplemented with many opt-in travelers. Motived by this view, this study\ndevelops mathematical approaches to quantify the coordination potential between\ntwo and among multiple travelers. Next, we develop the adaptive centroid-based\nclustering algorithm (ACCA), which splits travelers en route in a local network\ninto CGs, each with proper size and strong coordination potential. Moreover,\nthe ACCA is statistically secured to stop at a local optimal clustering\nsolution, which balances the inner-cluster and inter-cluster coordination\npotential. It can be implemented by parallel computation to accelerate its\ncomputing efficiency. Furthermore, we propose a clustering based coordinated\nrouting mechanism (CB-CRM), which implements a CRM on each individual CG. The\nnumerical experiments built upon both Sioux Falls and Hardee city networks show\nthat the ACCA works efficiently to form proper coordination groups so that as\ncompared to the CRM, the CB-CRM significantly improves computation efficiency\nwith minor system performance loss in a large network. This merit becomes more\napparent under high penetration and congested traffic condition.

This new estimator uses a Square\nRoot Unscented Kalman Filter (SR-UKF) to fuse multiple proprioceptive sensors\navailable on a legged robot. In contrast to IMU-centric filtering approaches,\nCOCLO formulates prediction and measurement models according to the contact\nstatus of legs.

However, well before their\nformation and at external strains where plastic deformation just begins to be\nsignificant, non-affine displacement organizes itself along localized bands.\nThe shear bands subsequently form at the edges of these\nnon-affine-displacement-bands, and present an alternating rotation-quadrupole\nstructure, as found previously by \\c{S}opu et al. (2017) in the case of a\nnotched sample loaded in tension. The thickness of shear bands is roughly\ndetermined by the available plastic energy. The onset of shear banding is\naccompanied by a sharp increase in the rate of change of the rotation angle\nlocalization, the strain localization, and the non-affine square displacement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 23:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

With this in mind, we have developed an\nend-to-end modular and extensible software pipeline for building and sharing\nmachine learning models that predict key pharma-relevant parameters. The ATOM\nModeling PipeLine, or AMPL, extends the functionality of the open source\nlibrary DeepChem and supports an array of machine learning and molecular\nfeaturization tools. We have benchmarked AMPL on a large collection of\npharmaceutical datasets covering a wide range of parameters. As a result of\nthese comprehensive experiments, we have found that physicochemical descriptors\nand deep learning-based graph representations significantly outperform\ntraditional fingerprints in the characterization of molecular features. We have\nalso found that dataset size is directly correlated to prediction performance,\nand that single-task deep learning models only outperform shallow learners if\nthere is sufficient data. Likewise, dataset size has a direct impact on model\npredictivity, independent of comprehensive hyperparameter model tuning. Our\nfindings point to the need for public dataset integration or\nmulti-task/transfer learning approaches. Lastly, we found that uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) analysis may help identify model error; however, efficacy\nof UQ to filter predictions varies considerably between datasets and\nfeaturization/model types.

One\ninteresting future possibility is to detect gravitational waves from\nGW150914-like stellar-mass black hole binaries with both ground-based and\nspace-based detectors. We here demonstrate the power of testing extreme gravity\nwith such multi-band gravitational-wave observations. In particular, we\nconsider two theory-agnostic methods to test gravity using gravitational waves.\nThe first test is the parameterized test where we introduce generic\nnon-Einsteinian corrections to the waveform, which can easily be mapped to\nparameters in known example theories beyond general relativity. The second test\nis the inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency test where one derives the mass and\nspin of a merger remnant from the inspiral and merger-ringdown independently\nassuming general relativity is correct, and then check their consistency. In\nboth cases, we use Fisher analyses and compare the results with Bayesian ones\nwherever possible. Regarding the first test, we find that multi-band\nobservations can be crucial in probing certain modified theories of gravity,\nincluding those with gravitational parity violation. Regarding the second test,\nwe show that future single-band detections can improve upon the current tests\nby roughly three orders of magnitude, and further 7-10 times improvement may be\nrealized with multi-band observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 02:32:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 21:52:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 20:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

Colour centres in diamond have emerged as leading\nsolid-state 'artificial atom' qubits, enabling on-demand remote entanglement,\ncoherent control of over 10 ancillae qubits with minute-long coherence times,\nand memory-enhanced quantum communication. A critical next step is to integrate\nlarge numbers of artificial atoms with photonic architectures to enable\nlarge-scale quantum information processing systems.

Importantly, these\nconnections in PRC-NPTNs once initialized remain permanent throughout training\nand testing. Permanent random connectomes make these architectures loosely more\nbiologically plausible than many other mainstream network architectures which\nrequire highly ordered structures. We motivate randomly initialized connections\nas a simple method to learn invariance from data itself while invoking\ninvariance towards multiple nuisance transformations simultaneously.

Accordingly, the unemployment gap can be\nmeasured from three sufficient statistics: elasticity of the Beveridge curve,\nsocial cost of unemployment, and cost of recruiting. Applying this formula to\nthe United States, 1951--2019, we find that the efficient unemployment rate\naverages 4.3%, always remains between 3.0% and 5.4%, and has been stable\nbetween 3.8% and 4.6% since 1990.

Such glasses are typically electrical insulators, and endowing\nthem with electrical conductivity without changing their salutary mechanical\nproperties, weight, or thermoformability enables new applications in\nmultifunctional utensils, smart windows, and automotive parts. Previous\nstrategies to impart electrical conductivity include modifying the glass\ncomposition or forming a solid-in-solid composite of the glass and a conductive\nphase. Here we demonstrate using the latter strategy the highest reported\nroom-temperature electrical conductivity in a bulk oxide glass 1800 S/m\ncorresponding to the theoretical limit for the loading fraction of the\nconductive phase. This is achieved through glass-sintering of a mixture of\ncarbon nanofibers and oxide flint F2 or soda lime glasses, with the bulk\nconductivity further enhanced by a polyethylene-block-poly(ethylene glycol)\nadditive. A theoretical model provides predictions that are in excellent\nagreement with the dependence of conductivity of these composites on the\ncarbon-loading fraction. Moreover, nanoscale electrical characterization of the\ncomposite samples provides evidence for the existence of a connected network of\ncarbon nanofibers throughout the bulk.

From temperature-programmed desorption experiments with a\nresonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) method for H2 detection, the\nH2 coverage-dependent activation energies for H2 desorption are determined.

We consider a simple toy model\nwhere the matter is concentrated in the rather small region between the inner\nphoton sphere associated with the mass of central black hole and outer photon\nsphere associated with the total mass outside. If no photon sphere is present\ninside the matter distribution, then effective potential displays an\ninteresting trend with maxima at inner and outer photon sphere, with a peak at\ninner photon sphere higher than that at outer photon sphere. In such a case we\nget three distinct set of infinitely many relativistic images and Einstein\nrings that occur due to the light rays that approach the black hole from a\ndistant source and get reflected just outside the outer photon sphere, due to\nlight rays that enter the outer photon sphere slightly above the outer peak and\nget reflected off the potential barrier inside the matter distribution and due\nto the light rays that get reflected just outside the inner photon sphere. This\nkind of pattern of images is quite unprecedented. We show that since\nrelativistic images are highly demagnified, only three images are prominently\nvisible from the point of observations in the presence of matter as opposed to\nonly one prominent image in case of a single isolated black hole and also\ncompute the time delay between them. This provides a smoking gun signature of\nthe presence of matter lump around the black hole. We further argue that if the\nmass of the black hole inferred from the observation of the size of its shadow\nis less than the mass inferred from the motion of objects around it, it signals\nthe presence of matter in the vicinity of the black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 06:11:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Nov 2019 05:01:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 09:06:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 15:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

As the effective wavelength of RF becomes comparable or smaller than\nthe dimension of the brain at B0 larger than 7 Tesla, the increased B1+\ninhomogeneity of UHF MRI results in poor SNR and uneven contrast.

The robustness of multilayer networks has\nattracted great interest, where the modeling and theoretical studies of which\nalways rely on the concept of multilayer networks and percolation methods. A\nstraightforward and tacit assumption is that the interdependence across network\nlayers is strong, which means that a node will fail entirely with the removal\nof all links if one of its interdependent neighbours fails. However, this\noversimplification cannot describe the general form of interactions across the\nnetwork layers in a real-world multilayer system. In this paper, we reveal the\nnature of the avalanche disintegration of general multilayer networks with\narbitrary interdependency strength across network layers. Specifically, we\nidentify that the avalanche process of the whole system can essentially be\ndecomposed into two microscopic cascading dynamics in terms of the propagation\ndirection of the failures: depth penetration and scope extension. In the\nprocess of depth penetration, the failures propagate from layer to layer, where\nthe greater the number of failed nodes is, the greater the destructive power\nthat will emerge in an interdependency group.

Further, we\nfind that the nonlinearity within the standard model of particle physics is\nsignificantly magnified by the relativistic effect in the $\\text{p}_{1/2}$\nstate. To get rid of this obstacle in the new physics search, we suggest to\navoid $\\text{p}_{1/2}$, and use $\\text{p}_{3/2}$ instead for example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 08:21:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 08:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

The\nrelapse is observed only indirectly, in a ``blurry'' fashion, through\nlongitudinal prescriptions of drugs over a long period of time after the\nmedical act. We introduce a new model, called ZiMM (Zero-inflated Mixture of\nMultinomial distributions) in order to capture long-term and blurry relapses.\nOn top of it, we build an end-to-end deep-learning architecture called ZiMM\nEncoder-Decoder (ZiMM ED) that can learn from the complex, irregular, highly\nheterogeneous and sparse patterns of health events that are observed through a\nclaims-only database. ZiMM ED is applied on a ``non-clinical'' claims database,\nthat contains only timestamped reimbursement codes for drug purchases, medical\nprocedures and hospital diagnoses, the only available clinical feature being\nthe age of the patient. This setting is more challenging than a setting where\nbedside clinical signals are available. Our motivation for using such a\nnon-clinical claims database is its exhaustivity population-wise, compared to\nclinical electronic health records coming from a single or a small set of\nhospitals. Indeed, we consider a dataset containing the claims of almost\n\\emph{all French citizens} who had surgery for prostatic problems, with a\nhistory between 1.5 and 5 years. We consider a long-term (18 months) relapse\n(urination problems still occur despite surgery), which is blurry since it is\nobserved only through the reimbursement of a specific set of drugs for\nurination problems. Our experiments show that ZiMM ED improves several\nbaselines, including non-deep learning and deep-learning approaches, and that\nit allows working on such a dataset with minimal preprocessing work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 08:23:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 22:12:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 19:42:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

With the new encoded OSTBC\napproach, diversity is offered where each user receives all other users'\nsymbols, which allows the recovery of symbols in several ways. In addition,\nmultiple users can be accommodated with the same resource, which is quite\nuseful in a wireless system where resources are always restricted. By employing\nsuperposition modulation, the side information needed for error recovery can be\ntransmitted over the same resource used for the normal information frame.

Empirical analysis suggests properties about the\nevolution of experimental physics and in general of applied sciences, such as:\na) scientific fission, the evolution of scientific disciplines generates a\nprocess of division into two or more research fields that evolve as autonomous\nentities over time; b) ambidextrous drivers of science, the evolution of\nscience via scientific fission is due to scientific discoveries or new\ntechnologies; c) new driving research fields, the drivers of scientific\ndisciplines are new research fields rather than old ones; d) science driven by\ndevelopment of general purpose technologies, the evolution of experimental\nphysics and applied sciences is due to the convergence of experimental and\ntheoretical branches of physics associated with the development of computer,\ninformation systems and applied computational science.

Advances in nanotechnology are bringing us\ncloser to the development of dual and multifunctional nanoparticles that are\nchallenging the traditional distinction between diagnostic and treatment\nagents. The chase of innovative, multifunctional, more efficient, and safer\ntreatments is a major challenge in preclinical nanoparticle-mediated\nthermotherapeutic research for breast cancer. Here, we report that iron oxide\nnanoparticles have the dual capacity to act as both magnetic and drug delivery\nagents. The aim of this work was to investigate the in vitro effect of the\nloading of doxorubicin (DOX) on negatively charged polycarboxylic iron-oxide\nnanoparticles (SPIONs) and Rhodamine B functionalized SPIONs on breast\ncarcinoma cell lines. For proper analysis and understanding of cell behavior\nafter administration of DOX-SPIONs compared with free DOX, a complex set of in\nvitro tests, including production of MTT assay, cell cycle determination, and\ncellular uptake, were utilized. In summary, we have developed a magnetic\nnanoparticle-based drug delivery system that sequentially delivers the\ncytotoxic drug doxorubicin to breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231).

Thermal magnon\ncurrents, generated by temperature gradients, can be used to move magnetic\ntextures, from domain walls, to magnetic vortices and skyrmions. In the last\nyears, theoretical studies have centered in ferro- and antiferromagnetic spin\nstructures, where domain walls always move towards the hotter end of the\nthermal gradient. Here we perform numerical studies using atomistic spin\ndynamics simulations and complementary analytical calculations to derive an\nequation of motion for the domain wall velocity. We demonstrate that in\nferrimagnets, domain wall motion under thermal magnon currents shows a much\nricher dynamics. Below the Walker breakdown, we find that the temperature\ngradient always pulls the domain wall towards the hot end by minimizating its\nfree energy, in agreement with the observations for ferro- and antiferromagnets\nin the same regime. Above Walker breakdown, the ferrimagnetic domain wall can\nshow the opposite, counterintuitive behavior of moving towards the cold end. We\nshow that in this case, the motion to the hotter or the colder ends is driven\nby angular momentum transfer and therefore strongly related to the angular\nmomentum compensation temperature, a unique property of ferrimagnets where the\nintrinsic angular momentum of the ferrimagnet is zero while the sublattice\nangular momentum remains finite. In particular, we find that below the\ncompensation temperature the wall moves towards the cold end, whereas above it,\ntowards the hot end. Moreover, we find that for ferrimagnets, there is a torque\ncompensation temperature at which the domain wall dynamics shows similar\ncharacteristics to antiferromagnets, that is, quasi-inertia-free motion and the\nabsence of Walker breakdown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 10:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

Under the strong convexity of $f$ and $h^\\ast$, we proved that the\niteration sequence linearly converges to the saddle point. Then, we propose a\nPD-PIAG method without extrapolations. The primal-dual gap of the iteration\nsequence is proved to be sublinearly convergent under strong convexity of $f$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 10:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-14"}

Here a novel variant of\nPLAL was developed, where a doubled frequency Nd:YAG laser beam (532 nm, ~ 5\nns, 10 Hz) at different fluences and for different times was directed into a\nsealed vessel, toward the interface of the meniscus of ethanol with a tilted\nbulk metal target. Palladium, copper and silver NPs, synthesized in the\nperformed proof of concept experiments, were mass quantified, by an inductively\ncoupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, and characterized by\nultraviolet-visible extinction spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy\nand X-ray diffraction. The NPs consist of crystalline metals of a few nm size\nand their ablation rates and agglomeration levels depend on the employed laser\nfluences. The ensuing laser power-specific productivity curves for each metal,\npeaked at specific laser fluences, were fitted to the results of a simple model\naccounting for plasma absorption and heat transfer. The resulting peaked yields\nand concentrations were more than an order of magnitude higher than those\nobtained for totally immersed targets. Besides, the measured productivities\nshowed nearly linear dependencies during time intervals up to 30 min of\nablation, but became saturated at 1 h, due to accumulation of a significant\nnumber of NPs along the laser beam path, reducing the laser intensity reaching\nthe target. This suggested approach could inspire future studies that will\ncontribute to further developments of efficient generation of NPs with\ncontrolled characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 11:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

To constrain the bulk density one needs an estimate for the mass\nof the asteroid. The mass is estimated by analyzing an asteroid's gravitational\ninteraction with another object, such as another asteroid during a close\nencounter. An estimate for the mass has typically been obtained with linearized\nleast-squares methods despite the fact that this family of methods is not able\nto properly describe non-Gaussian parameter distributions. In addition, the\nuncertainties reported for asteroid masses in the literature are sometimes\ninconsistent with each other and suspected to be unrealistically low. We\npresent a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for the asteroid mass\nestimation problem based on asteroid-asteroid close encounters. We verify that\nour algorithm works correctly by applying it to synthetic data sets. We then\nuse astrometry available through the Minor Planet Center to estimate masses for\na few example cases and compare our results to results reported in the\nliterature.\n  Our mass estimates for the synthetic data sets are fully consistent with the\nground truth. The nominal masses for real example cases typically agree with\nthe literature but tend to have greater uncertainties than what is reported in\nrecent literature. Possible reasons for this include different astrometric\ndatasets and/or weights, different test asteroids, different force models and\ndifferent algorithms. For (16) Psyche, the target of NASA's Psyche mission, our\nmaximum likelihood mass is approximately 55% of what is reported in the\nliterature. Such a low mass would imply that the bulk density is significantly\nlower than previously expected and hence disagrees with the theory of (16)\nPsyche being the metallic core of a protoplanet. We however note that masses\nreported in recent literature remain within our 3-sigma limits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 12:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

We report the measurements of thick-target gamma-ray\nyields at 4.4 and 15.1 MeV from the $^{12}$C(p,p')$^{12}$C at proton energies\nof 19.5, 25, and 30 MeV. Measurements were made with two 3'' EJ309 cylindrical\nliquid scintillation detectors and thermoluminescent dosimeters placed at 0 and\n90 degrees. We estimate the highest yields of the 4.4- and 15.1-MeV gamma rays\nof 1.65$\\times10^{10}$ sr$^{-1}\\mu$ C$^{-1}$ and 4.47$\\times10^8$ sr$^{-1}\\mu$\nC$^{-1}$ at a proton energy of 30 MeV, respectively. The yield of 4.4 and 15.1\nMeV gamma rays in all experimental configurations is greater than a comparable\ndeuteron-driven reaction that produces the same gamma-ray energies-\n$^{11}$B(d,n$\\gamma$)$^{12}$C. However, a two orders of magnitude increase of\nthe neutron radiation dose is observed when the proton energy increases from\n19.5 to 30 MeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 13:46:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 15:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

Accretion\nvariability depends sensitively on the numerical sink prescription, but the\ntorque and relative accretion onto each component do not depend on the sink\ntimescale. Positive torque and highly variable accretion occurs only for mass\nratios greater than around $0.05$. This means that for mass ratios below\n$0.05$, the binary would migrate inward until the secondary accreted sufficient\nmass, after which it would execute a U-turn and migrate outward. We explore a\nrange of viscosities, from $\\alpha = 0.03$ to $\\alpha = 0.15$, and find that\nthis outward torque is proportional to the viscous torque, simply proportional\nto viscosity in this range. Dependence of accretion and torque on mass ratio is\nexplored in detail, densely sampling mass ratios between $0.01$ and unity.

The inverse exponential and oscillating potentials are\nshown to successfully generate the neutrino masses in the range $m \\sim\n10^{-2}-10^{-3}~$eV and to yield the current dark energy density in the regime\nof the late-time acceleration of the Universe. Depending on the choice of\npotentials, the acceleration could occur in two different regimes: (1) the\nregime of instability, and (2) the stable regime. The first regime of\ninstability is after the Universe underwent a first-order transition and is\nrolling toward the new stable vacuum. The imaginary sound velocity $c^2_s < 0$\nin this regime implies growing fluctuations of the neutrino density\n(clustering). In the second regime, the Universe smoothly changes its stable\nstates via a continuous transition. Since $c^2_s > 0$, the neutrino density is\nstable.

The directed\ngraph model is motivated by wireless networks wherein asymmetric communication\nlinks can occur. In the classical point-to-point communication model, a message\nsent on a communication link is private between the two nodes on the link. This\nallows a Byzantine faulty node to equivocate, i.e., send inconsistent\ninformation to its neighbors. This paper considers the local broadcast model of\ncommunication, wherein transmission by a node is received identically by all of\nits outgoing neighbors. This allows such neighbors to detect a faulty node's\nattempt to equivocate, effectively depriving the faulty nodes of the ability to\nsend conflicting information to different neighbors.\n  Prior work has obtained sufficient and necessary conditions on undirected\ngraphs to be able to achieve Byzantine consensus under the local broadcast\nmodel.

A\ncategorical variable is defined to be complex when it cannot be easily\ntranslated into a numerical variable, when the semantic of the categories\npotentially plays an important role in the optimal determination of\nstereotypes, and when it is also multi-choice (e.g., each item can be labelled\nwith one or more categories that may be applicable, in a non pre-defined\nnumber).\n  The main objective of this paper is to analyse the possibility of obtaining a\nviable recommendation system that operates on stereotypes generated directly\nvia the feature's metadata similarities, without using ratings information at\nthe time the generation of the classes. The encouraging results using\nintegrated MovieLens and Imdb data set show that the proposed algorithm\nperforms better than other categorical clustering algorithms like k-modes when\nclustering complex categorical features. Notably, the representation of complex\ncategorical features can help to alleviate cold-start issues in recommender\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 13:02:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

All models reported so far are based on either\nvariational autoencoder (VAE) or generative adversarial network (GAN). Here we\npropose a new type model based on an adversarially regularized autoencoder\n(ARAE). It basically uses latent variables like VAE, but the distribution of\nthe latent variables is obtained by adversarial training like in GAN. The\nlatter is intended to avoid both inappropriate approximation of posterior\ndistribution in VAE and difficulty in handling discrete variables in GAN. Our\nbenchmark study showed that ARAE indeed outperformed conventional models in\nterms of validity, uniqueness, and novelty per generated molecule. We also\ndemonstrated successful conditional generation of drug-like molecules with ARAE\nfor both cases of single and multiple properties control. As a potential\nreal-world application, we could generate EGFR inhibitors sharing the scaffolds\nof known active molecules while satisfying drug-like conditions simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 04:23:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-13"}
