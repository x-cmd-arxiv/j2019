Depending on the\nfill degree of the filter most insertions and queries only need to access one\nor two consecutive cache lines. This makes quotient filters fast compared to\nthe more commonly used Bloom filters that incur multiple cache misses. However,\nconcurrent Bloom filters are easy to implement and can be implemented lock-free\nwhile concurrent quotient filters are not as simple. Usually concurrent\nquotient filters work by using an external array of locks -- each protecting a\nregion of the table. Accessing this array incurs one additional cache miss per\noperation. We propose a new locking scheme that has no memory overhead. Using\nthis new locking scheme we achieve 1.8 times higher speedups than with the\ncommon external locking scheme.\n  Another advantage of quotient filters over Bloom filters is that a quotient\nfilter can change its size when it is becoming full. We implement this growing\ntechnique for our concurrent quotient filters and adapt it in a way that allows\nunbounded growing while keeping a bounded false positive rate. We call the\nresulting data structure a fully expandable quotient filter. Its design is\nsimilar to scalable Bloom filters, but we exploit some concepts inherent to\nquotient filters to improve the space efficiency and the query speed.\n  We also propose quotient filter variants that are aimed to reduce the number\nof status bits (2-status-bit variant) or to simplify concurrent implementations\n(linear probing quotient filter). The linear probing quotient filter even leads\nto a lock-free concurrent filter implementation. This is especially\ninteresting, since we show that any lock-free implementation of another common\nquotient filter variant would incur significant overheads in the form of\nadditional data fields or multiple passes over the accessed data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 16:13:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

Using the BPASS (Binary\nPopulation and Spectral Synthesis) stellar evolution models, we investigate the\npossibility that some massive stars in binaries can maintain the angular\nmomentum required for jet production, while still loosing their outer envelope\nthrough winds or binary interactions. We find that a total hydrogen mass of\nless than 0.0005 Msun and a helium ejecta mass fraction of less than 0.20\nprovide the best thresholds for the supernova type II/Ibc and Ib/Ic divisions\nrespectively. Tidal interactions in binaries are accounted for by applying a\ntidal algorithm to post-process the stellar evolution models output by BPASS.\nWe show that the observed volumetric gamma-ray burst rate evolution can be\nrecreated using two distinct pathways and plausible distributions for burst\nparameters. In the first pathway, stars are spun up by mass accretion into a\nquasi-homogeneous state. In the second, tides maintain rotation where otherwise\nthe star would spin down. Both lead to type Ic supernova progenitors, and a\nmetallicity distribution consistent with the GRB host galaxy population. The\ninferred core angular momentum threshold for jet production is consistent with\ntheoretical requirements for collapsars, given the assumptions made in our\nmodel.

This technique has the advantage that it\nself-consistently handles photometric errors, missing data in various\nbandpasses, and star-by-star prior constraints on cluster membership.\nSimulations are used to verify uncertainties and quantify selection biases in\nour analysis, illustrating that among binaries with mass ratios >0.5, we\nrecover the binary fraction to better than 7% in the mean, with no significant\ndependence on binary fraction and a mild dependence on assumed mass ratio\ndistribution. Using our photometric catalog, we recover the majority\n(65%$\\pm$11%) of spectroscopically identified main sequence binaries, including\n8 of the 9 with spectroscopically measured mass ratios. Accounting for\nincompleteness and systematics, we derive a mass ratio distribution that rises\ntoward lower mass ratios (within our $q >$0.5 analysis domain). We observe a\nraw binary fraction for solar-type main sequence stars with mass ratios $q\n>$0.5 of 42%$\\pm$4%, independent of the assumed mass ratio distribution to\nwithin its uncertainties, consistent with literature values for old open\nclusters but significantly higher than the field solar-type binary fraction. We\nconfirm that the binaries identified by our method are more concentrated than\nsingle stars, in agreement with previous studies, and we demonstrate that the\nbinary nature of those candidates which remain unidentified spectroscopically\nis strongly supported by photometry from Gaia DR2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 16:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

It is one of the instrumental errors that can\naffect the position of the target as perceived on the sky and its flux\ndistribution. This effect will affect the results of astronomical observations\nif not corrected by an atmospheric dispersion corrector (ADC). In\nhigh-resolution spectrographs, in order to reach a radial velocity (RV)\nprecision of 10 cm/s, an ADC is expected to return residuals at only a few tens\nof milli-arcseconds (mas). In fact, current state-of-the-art spectrographs\nconservatively require this level of residuals, although no work has been done\nto quantify the impact of atmospheric dispersion. In this work we test the\neffect of atmospheric dispersion on astronomical observations in general, and\nin particular on RV precision degradation and flux losses. Our scientific\nobjective was to quantify the amount of residuals needed to fulfill the\nrequirements set on an ADC during the design phase. We found that up to a\ndispersion of 100 mas, the effect on the RV is negligible. However, on the flux\nlosses, such a dispersion can create a loss of ~2% at 380 nm, a significant\nvalue when efficiency is critical. The requirements set on ADC residuals should\ntake into consideration the atmospheric conditions where the ADC will function,\nand also all the aspects related with not only the RV precision requirements\nbut also the guiding camera used, the tolerances on the flux loss, and the\ndifferent melt data of the chosen glasses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 16:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

We then use these tools in order to see when harvesting leads to\nextinction or persistence of species, as well as what the optimal harvesting\nstrategies, which maximize the expected long term yield, look like.

Most crucially, we find that the\ntransport mechanisms inherently depend on the dominance of droplet driving to\nthermal driving that can quantified by (i) the bubblance parameter $b$, which\nmeasures the ratio of energy produced by the dispersed phase and the energy of\nthe background turbulence, and (ii) $Ra_d/Ra$, where $Ra_d$ is the droplet\nRayleigh number, which we introduce in this paper. When $b \\lesssim O(10^{-1})$\nand $Ra_d/Ra \\lesssim O(100)$, the $Nu$ scaling is expected to recover to the\nVC scaling without droplets, and comparison with $b$ and $Ra_d/Ra$ from our\ndata supports this notion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 17:52:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

To\nrecover the maximum number of lost packets within a short time, existing packet\nrecovery solutions often rely on instantly decodable network coding (IDNC).\nSome of these solutions can recover nearly the maximum number of lost packets\npossible at the cost of collecting feedback from all (or a large percentage of)\nusers. This is impractical in dense networks. In addition, their runtime grows\nwith the number of users, which is not desirable due to the urgent delivery\ndeadline of real-time applications. In this work, we introduce RIDNC, a random\nencoding approach to IDNC. We propose RACE, a light RIDNC encoder that can\nrecover nearly as many lost packets as the optimal RIDNC encoder. We compare\nRACE with the CrowdWiFi encoder, a high performing packet loss recovery\nsolution used in CrowdWiFi, a commercial system for broadcasting live video in\ndense networks. We show that RACE is up to two orders of magnitude faster than\nthe CrowdWiFi encoder, and recovers more lost packets in practice, where there\nis not enough time to collect feedback from many users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 18:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

We\ntherefore also propose using a latent variable model to compactly represent the\nset of valid states for the planner, so that the policies provide an\nabstraction of actions, and the latent variable model provides an abstraction\nof states.

Due to the plasma screening\neffect, the color attraction between the heavy quark antiquark pair inside a\nquarkonium is significantly suppressed at high temperature and thus no bound\nstates can exist, i.e., they \"melt\". In addition, a bound heavy quark antiquark\npair can dissociate if enough energy is transferred to it in a dynamical\nprocess inside the plasma. So one would expect the production of quarkonium to\nbe considerably suppressed in heavy ion collisions. However, experimental\nmeasurements have shown that a large amount of quarkonia survive the evolution\ninside the high temperature plasma. It is realized that the in-medium\nrecombination of unbound heavy quark pairs into quarkonium is as crucial as the\nmelting and dissociation. Thus, phenomenological studies have to account for\nstatic screening, dissociation and recombination in a consistent way. But\nrecombination is less understood theoretically than the melting and\ndissociation. Many studies using semi-classical transport equations model the\nrecombination effect from the consideration of detailed balance at thermal\nequilibrium. However, these studies cannot explain how the system of quarkonium\nreaches equilibrium and estimate the time scale of the thermalization.\nRecently, another approach based on the open quantum system formalism started\nbeing used. In this framework, one solves a quantum evolution for in-medium\nquarkonium. Dissociation and recombination are accounted for consistently.\nHowever, the connection between the semi-classical transport equation and the\nquantum evolution is not clear. In this dissertation, I will try to address the\nissues raised above. As a warm-up project, I will first study a similar\nproblem: $\\alpha$-$\\alpha$ scattering at the $^8$Be resonance inside an\n$e^-e^+\\gamma$ plasma. By applying pionless effective field theory and thermal\nfield theory, I will show how the plasma screening effect modifies the $^8$Be\nresonance energy and width. I will discuss the need to use the open quantum\nsystem formalism when studying the time evolution of a system embedded inside a\nplasma. Then I will use effective field theory of QCD and the open quantum\nsystem formalism to derive a Lindblad equation for bound and unbound heavy\nquark antiquark pairs inside a weakly-coupled QGP. Under the Markovian\napproximation and the assumption of weak coupling between the system and the\nenvironment, the Lindblad equation will be shown to turn to a Boltzmann\ntransport equation if a Wigner transform is applied to the open system density\nmatrix. These assumptions will be justified by using the separation of scales,\nwhich is assumed in the construction of effective field theory. I will show the\nscattering amplitudes that contribute to the collision terms in the Boltzmann\nequation are gauge invariant and infrared safe. By coupling the transport\nequation of quarkonium with those of open heavy flavors and solving them using\nMonte Carlo simulations, I will demonstrate how the system of bound and unbound\nheavy quark antiquark pairs reaches detailed balance and equilibrium inside the\nQGP. Phenomenologically, my calculations can describe the experimental data on\nbottomonium production. Finally I will extend the framework to study the\nin-medium evolution of heavy diquarks and estimate the production rate of the\ndoubly charmed baryon $\\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ in heavy ion collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 19:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

We specifically discuss results on two training\ncases: (i) learning of support parameters on a pre-trained BNN and (ii)\nsimultaneous learning of supports and weight binarization. In the former case,\nour approach reduces classification error in MNIST by 35.71% (error rate\ndecreases from 1.4% to 0.91%). In the latter case, the error is reduced by\n27.65% (error rate decreases from 1.4% to 1.13%). To reduce the power\noverheads, we propose a dynamic drop out a part of the support parameters.

However, processing micropayments individually can be expensive,\nwith transaction fees exceeding the payment value itself. By aggregating these\nsmall transactions into a few larger ones, and using cryptocurrencies, today's\ndecentralized probabilistic micropayment schemes can reduce these fees.\nUnfortunately, existing solutions force micropayments to be issued\nsequentially, thus to support fast issuance rates a customer needs to create a\nlarge number of escrows, which bloats the blockchain. Moreover, these schemes\nincur a large computation and bandwidth overhead, which limit their\napplicability in large-scale systems.\n  In this paper, we propose MicroCash, the first decentralized probabilistic\nframework that supports concurrent micropayments. MicroCash introduces a novel\nescrow setup that enables a customer to concurrently issue payment tickets at a\nfast rate using a single escrow. MicroCash is also cost effective because it\nallows for ticket exchange using only one round of communication, and it\naggregates the micropayments using a lottery protocol that requires only secure\nhashing. Our experiments show that MicroCash can process thousands of tickets\nper second, which is around 1.7-4.2x times the rate of a state-of-the-art\nsequential micropayment system. Moreover, MicroCash supports any ticket issue\nrate over any period using only one escrow, while the sequential scheme would\nneed more than 1000 escrows per second to permit high rates. This enables our\nsystem to further reduce transaction fees and data on the blockchain by around\n50%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 19:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

How proteins can fold\nquickly even in the presence of such topological obstacles is a debated\nquestion in structural biology. Recently, the hypothesis that energetic\nfrustration might be a mechanism to avoid topological frustration has been put\nforward based on the empirical observation that loops involved in entanglements\nare stabilized by weak interactions between amino-acids at their extrema. To\nverify this idea, we use a toy lattice model for the folding of proteins into\ntwo almost identical structures, one entangled and one not. As expected, the\nfolding time is longer when random sequences folds into the entangled\nstructure. This holds also under an evolutionary pressure simulated by\noptimizing the folding time. It turns out that optmized protein sequences in\nthe entangled structure are in fact characterized by frustrated interactions at\nthe closures of entangled loops. This phenomenon is much less enhanced in the\ncontrol case where the entanglement is not present. Our findings, which are in\nagreement with experimental observations, corroborate the idea that an\nevolutionary pressure shapes the folding funnel to avoid topological and\nkinetic traps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 21:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

Here, we have\nfabricated multi-GMR sensors (up to 12 repetitions) keeping good GMR ratio,\nlinearity and low roughness. From magnetotransport measurements, two different\nresistance responses have been observed with a crossover around 5 GMR\nrepetitions: step-like (N<5) and linear (N>5) behavior, respectively. With the\nhelp of micromagnetic simulations, we have analyzed in detail the two main\nmagnetic mechanisms: the Neel coupling distribution induced by the roughness\npropagation and the additive dipolar coupling between the N free layers.\nFurthermore we have correlated the dipolar coupling mechanism, controlled by\nthe number of GMRs (N) and lateral dimensions (width), to the sensor\nperformance (sensitivity, noise and detectivity) in good agreement with\nanalytical theory. The noise roughly decreases in multi-GMRs as 1/\\sqrt{N} in\nboth regimes (low frequency 1/f and thermal noise). The sensitivity is even\nstronger reduced, scaling as 1/N, in the strong dipolar regime (narrow devices)\nwhile converges to a constant value in the weak dipolar regime (wide devices).\nVery interestingly, they are more robust against undesirable RTN noise than\nsingle GMRs at high voltages and the linearity can be extended towards much\nlarger magnetic field range without dealing with the size and the reduction of\nGMR ratio. Finally, we have identified the optimal conditions for which\nmulti-GMRs exhibit lower magnetic field detectivity than single GMRs: wide\ndevices operating in the thermal regime where much higher voltage can be\napplied without generating remarkable magnetic noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 21:23:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

Communities are indeed characterized by\nspecific properties, that are different from those of both the individual node\nand the whole network, and they can affect various processes on the network. In\nthe International Trade Network, community detection aims to search sets of\ncountries (or of trade sectors) which have a high intra-cluster connectivity\nand a low inter-cluster connectivity. In general, exchanges among countries\noccur according to preferential economic relationships ranging over different\nsectors. In this paper, we combine community detection with specific\ntopological indicators, such as centrality measures. As a result, a new\nweighted network is constructed by the original one, in which weights are\ndetermined taking into account all the topological indicators in a\nmulti-criteria approach. To solve the resulting Clique Partitioning Problem and\nfind homogeneous group of nations, we use a new fast algorithm, based on quick\ndescents to a local optimal solution.

However, the detectability of atmospheric molecular\nspecies may be severely impacted by the presence of clouds and/or hazes. In\nthis work, we perform 3-D General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations with the\nLMD Generic model supplemented by 1-D photochemistry simulations at the\nterminator with the Atmos model to simulate several possible atmospheres for\nTRAPPIST-1e, 1f and 1g: 1) modern Earth, 2) Archean Earth, and 3) CO2-rich\natmospheres. JWST synthetic transit spectra were computed using the GSFC\nPlanetary Spectrum Generator (PSG). We find that TRAPPIST-1e, 1f and 1g\natmospheres, with clouds and/or hazes, could be detected using JWST's NIRSpec\nprism from the CO2 absorption line at 4.3 um in less than 15 transits at 3\nsigma or less than 35 transits at 5 sigma.

However, as\nthe distributions of attention maps and that of Grad-CAMs differ, it would not\nbe suitable to directly use these as a form of supervision. Rather, we propose\nthe use of a discriminator that aims to distinguish samples of visual\nexplanation and attention maps. The use of adversarial training of the\nattention regions as a two-player game between attention and explanation serves\nto bring the distributions of attention maps and visual explanations closer.\nSignificantly, we observe that providing such a means of supervision also\nresults in attention maps that are more closely related to human attention\nresulting in a substantial improvement over baseline stacked attention network\n(SAN) models.

These logics build on so-called separation\nalgebras, which allow expressing properties of heap regions such that\nmodifications to a region do not invalidate properties stated about the\nremainder of the heap. This concept is key to enabling modular reasoning and\nalso extends to concurrency. While heaps are naturally related to mathematical\ngraphs, many ubiquitous graph properties are non-local in character, such as\nreachability between nodes, path lengths, acyclicity and other structural\ninvariants, as well as data invariants which combine with these notions.\nReasoning modularly about such graph properties remains notoriously difficult,\nsince a local modification can have side-effects on a global property that\ncannot be easily confined to a small region.\n  In this paper, we address the question: What separation algebra can be used\nto avoid proof arguments reverting back to tedious global reasoning in such\ncases? To this end, we consider a general class of global graph properties\nexpressed as fixpoints of algebraic equations over graphs. We present\nmathematical foundations for reasoning about this class of properties, imposing\nminimal requirements on the underlying theory that allow us to define a\nsuitable separation algebra. Building on this theory we develop a general proof\ntechnique for modular reasoning about global graph properties over program\nheaps, in a way which can be integrated with existing separation logics.

Historically, system budgets have been described by the Q-factor\nconverted from the bit error rate (BER) under binary modulation and direct\ndetection. The introduction of hard-decision forward error correction (FEC) did\nnot change this. In recent years technologies have changed significantly to\ncomprise coherent detection, multilevel modulation and soft FEC. In such\nadvanced systems, different metrics such as (nomalized) generalized mutual\ninformation (GMI/NGMI) and asymmetric information (ASI) are regarded as being\nmore reliable. On the other hand, Q budgets are still useful because pre-FEC\nBER monitoring is established in industry for live system monitoring.\n  The pre-FEC BER is easily estimated from available information of the number\nof flipped bits in the FEC decoding, which does not require knowledge of the\ntransmitted bits that are unknown in live systems. Therefore, the use of\nmetrics like GMI/NGMI/ASI for performance monitoring has not been possible in\nlive systems. However, in this work we propose a blind soft-performance\nestimation method. Based on a histogram of log-likelihood-values without the\nknowledge of the transmitted bits, we show how the ASI can be estimated.\n  We examined the proposed method experimentally for 16 and 64-ary quadrature\namplitude modulation (QAM) and probabilistically shaped 16, 64, and 256-QAM in\nrecirculating loop experiments. We see a relative error of 3.6%, which\ncorresponds to around 0.5 dB signal-to-noise ratio difference for binary\nmodulation, in the regime where the ASI is larger than the assumed FEC\nthreshold. For this proposed method, the digital signal processing circuitry\nrequires only a minimal additional function of storing the L-value histograms\nbefore the soft-decision FEC decoder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 00:35:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 03:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

The design study focused on the instrument, a deployment\nrover, the lander and base station, and delivered an architecture broadly\nconsistent with the requirements for a Probe mission. This notional\narchitecture consists of 128 dipole antennas deployed across a 10 km area by a\nrover, and tethered to a base station for central processing, power and data\ntransmission to the Lunar Gateway, or an alternative relay satellite. FARSIDE\nwould provide the capability to image the entire sky each minute in 1400\nchannels spanning frequencies from 150 kHz to 40 MHz, extending down two orders\nof magnitude below bands accessible to ground-based radio astronomy. The lunar\nfarside can simultaneously provide isolation from terrestrial radio frequency\ninterference, auroral kilometric radiation, and plasma noise from the solar\nwind. This would enable near-continuous monitoring of the nearest stellar\nsystems in the search for the radio signatures of coronal mass ejections and\nenergetic particle events, and would also detect the magnetospheres for the\nnearest candidate habitable exoplanets. Simultaneously, FARSIDE would be used\nto characterize similar activity in our own solar system, from the Sun to the\nouter planets. Through precision calibration via an orbiting beacon, and\nexquisite foreground characterization, FARSIDE would also measure the Dark Ages\nglobal 21-cm signal at redshifts from 50-100. It will also be a pathfinder for\na larger 21-cm power spectrum instrument by carefully measuring the foreground\nwith high dynamic range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 00:50:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

The study of young solar type stars is fundamental for a better\nunderstanding of the magnetic activity of the Sun. As a planet in transit\ncrosses in front of its host star, a darkspot on the stellar surface may be\nocculted, causing a detectable variation in the light curve. Kepler-63 is a\nyoung solar-like star withan age of only 210 Myr that exhibit photometric\nvariations compatible with spot signatures. Since its orbiting planet is in an\nalmostpolar orbit, different latitudes of the star can be probed by the method\nof spot transit mapping. Methods. A total of 150 transits of Kepler-63b were\nobserved in the short cadence light curve, corresponding to a total duration of\nabout 4 years. Each transit light curve was fit by a model that simulates\nplanetary transits and allows the inclusion of starspots on the surface of the\nhost star. This enables the physical characterisation of the spots size,\nintensity, and location. We determine the spot position in a reference frame\nthat rotates with the star, and thus obtain the latitudinal distribution of the\nspots. Results. A total of 297 spots were fit and their sizes, intensities, and\npositions determined. The latitude distribution of spots exhibits a bimodality\nwith a lack of spots around 34{\\deg}. The high latitude spots dominate the\nmagnetic cycle of Kepler-63. For a mean stellar rotation period of 5.400d, 59\nspots were found at approximately the same longitude and latitude on a later\ntransit. Conclusions. Due to the geometry of the Kepler-63 system, we were able\nto build a starspot \"butterfly diagram\". It was also possible to infer\nKepler-63 differential rotation from the presence of spots at different\nlatitudes. This star was found to rotate almost rigidly with a period of 5.400d\nand relative shear close to 0.01% for latitudes less than 34{\\deg}, whereas the\nhigh latitudes do not follow a well behaved pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 01:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

Specifically,\nRA-DPL improves existing projective dictionary pair learning in four\nperspectives. First, it applies a sparse l2,1-norm based metric to encode the\nrecon-struction error to deliver the robust projective dictionary pairs, and\nthe l2,1-norm has the potential to minimize the error.

Fourth, it also considers improving the\ndiscriminating ability of coding coefficients and dictionary by incorporating a\ndiscriminating function, which can ensure high intra-class compactness and\ninter-class separation in the code space.

To address this problem, previous methods\nmainly use holistic representations to align feature-level and pixel-level\ndistributions of different domains, which may neglect the instance-level\ncharacteristics of objects in images. Besides, when transferring detection\nability across different domains, it is important to obtain the instance-level\nfeatures that are domain-invariant, instead of the styles that are\ndomain-specific. Therefore, in order to extract instance-invariant features, we\nshould disentangle the domain-invariant features from the domain-specific\nfeatures. To this end, a progressive disentangled framework is first proposed\nto solve domain adaptive object detection.

Many studies\nconsider only matching the image contents, which often causes two types of\nghosts: color in-consistencies in shadow regions or artifacts on shadow\nboundaries. In this paper, we tackle these issues in two ways. First, to\ncarefully learn the border artifacts-free image, we propose a novel network\nstructure named the dual hierarchically aggregation network~(DHAN). It contains\na series of growth dilated convolutions as the backbone without any\ndown-samplings, and we hierarchically aggregate multi-context features for\nattention and prediction, respectively. Second, we argue that training on a\nlimited dataset restricts the textural understanding of the network, which\nleads to the shadow region color in-consistencies. Currently, the largest\ndataset contains 2k+ shadow/shadow-free image pairs. However, it has only 0.1k+\nunique scenes since many samples share exactly the same background with\ndifferent shadow positions. Thus, we design a shadow matting generative\nadversarial network~(SMGAN) to synthesize realistic shadow mattings from a\ngiven shadow mask and shadow-free image. With the help of novel masks or\nscenes, we enhance the current datasets using synthesized shadow images.\nExperiments show that our DHAN can erase the shadows and produce high-quality\nghost-free images.

The\nmost impressive characteristic of Yottixel is its ability to represent whole\nslide images (WSIs) in a compact manner. Yottixel can perform millions of\nsearches in real-time with a high search accuracy and low storage profile.\nYottixel uses an intelligent indexing algorithm capable of representing WSIs\nwith a mosaic of patches by converting them into a small number of methodically\nextracted barcodes, called \"Bunch of Barcodes\" (BoB), the most prominent\nperformance enabler of Yottixel.

The size of the nucleus is a window into\nthis duality: while the charge radii globally scale as $A^{1/3}$, their\nevolution across isotopic chains reveals unanticipated structural phenomena\n[1-3]. The most ubiquitous of these is perhaps the Odd-Even Staggering (OES)\n[4]: isotopes with an odd number of neutrons are usually smaller in size than\nthe trend of their even-neutron neighbours suggests. This OES effect varies\nwith the number of protons and neutrons and poses a significant challenge for\nnuclear theory [5-7]. Here, we examine this problem with new measurements of\nthe charge radii of short-lived copper isotopes up to the very exotic $^{78}$Cu\n$(Z=29, N=49)$, produced at only 20 ions/s, using the highly-sensitive\nCollinear Resonance Ionisation Spectroscopy (CRIS) method at ISOLDE-CERN. Due\nto the presence of a single proton outside of the closed Z=28 shell, these\nmeasurements provide crucial insights into the single-particle proton structure\nand how this affects the charge radii. We observe an unexpected reduction in\nthe OES for isotopes approaching the $N=50$ shell gap. To describe the data, we\napplied models based on nuclear Density Functional Theory [2,8] (DFT) and\nab-initio Valence-Space In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (VS-IMSRG)\ntheory [9,10]. Through these comparisons, we demonstrate a relation between the\nglobal behavior of charge radii and the saturation density of nuclear matter,\nand show that the local charge radii variations, which reflect the many-body\npolarization effects due to the odd neutron, naturally emerge from the VS-IMSRG\ncalculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 08:41:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 08:27:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2020 08:32:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-16"}

It trains another CNN to predict a saliency map from an\ninput image, such that the CNN for MDE continues to accurately estimate the\ndepth map from the image with its non-salient part masked out. We report the\nfollowing findings. First, unsurprisingly, attacks by IFGSM (or equivalently\nPGD) succeed in making the CNNs yield inaccurate depth estimates. Second, the\nattacks can be defended by masking out non-salient pixels, indicating that the\nattacks function by perturbing mostly non-salient pixels. However, the\nprediction of saliency maps is itself vulnerable to the attacks, even though it\nis not the direct target of the attacks. We show that the attacks can be\ndefended by using a saliency map predicted by a CNN trained to be robust to the\nattacks. These results provide an effective defense method as well as a clue to\nunderstanding the computational mechanism of CNNs for MDE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 09:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

Adversaries can observe screening procedures and arrive\nat a time when there will be gaps in screening due to limited resource\ncapacities. To capture this game between ports and adversaries, this problem\nhas been previously represented as a Stackelberg game, referred to as a Threat\nScreening Game (TSG). Given the significant complexity associated with solving\nTSGs and uncertainty in arrivals of customers, existing work has assumed that\nscreenees arrive and are allocated security resources at the beginning of the\ntime window. In practice, screenees such as airport passengers arrive in bursts\ncorrelated with flight time and are not bound by fixed time windows.

However, conventional resource allocation for virtualized networks\nwould still follow a fixed pattern based on the predicted capacity needs of the\nusers, even though, in reality, the actual traffic demand of a user will always\ntend to fluctuate. The mismatch between the fixed capacity allocation and the\nactual fluctuating traffic would lead to degradation of provisioned network\nservices and inefficiency in the assigned network capacity. To overcome this,\nwe propose a new spectrum trading (ST) scheme between virtual optical networks\n(VONs) in the context of an elastic optical network (EON). The key idea here is\nto allow different VONs to trade their spectrum resources according to the\nactual capacity they need at different time instants. A VON with unused spectra\ncan then trade away its unused spectra to other VONs that are short of spectrum\nresources at that time. In exchange, it is rewarded with a certain amount of\ncredit for its contribution to the ST community, which it can then use later to\nget extra bandwidth, if needed. The trust-worthiness of the trading records\nbetween the VONs is ensured in a distributed fashion through a\nblockchain-assisted account book that is updated whenever a new trade occurs.\nFor this, we develop a software-defined control plane to enable spectrum\ntrading in an EON. The performance of the ST scheme is evaluated and compared\nwith a scenario without such trading. Our results show that the proposed ST\nscheme is effective in improving the QoS of each VON and significantly improves\nthe overall network capacity utilization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 10:22:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

While the\ninitial moist response is similar to the dry reference run, albeit with a\nreduced equivalent depth, the long time solution depends quite strikingly on\nthe nature of the saturation field. For a saturation field that only depends on\nlatitude, specifically, one with a peak at the equator and falls off\nmeridionally in both hemispheres, height imbalances adjust to large-scale,\nlow-frequency westward propagating modes. When the background saturation\nenvironment is also allowed to vary with longitude, in addition to a westward\nquadrupole, there is a distinct eastward propagating response at long times.\nThe nature of this eastward propagating mode is well described by moist\npotential vorticity conservation and it consists of wave packets that arc out\nto midlatitudes and return to the tropics and are predominantly rotational in\ncharacter. In all moist cases, initially formed Kelvin waves decay, and this\nappears to be tied to the off-equatorial organization of moisture anomalies by\nrotational modes. Many of these basic features carry over to the response in\nthe presence of realistic saturation fields derived from reanalysis based\nprecipitable water. In boreal summer, long time eastward response is restricted\nto northern hemisphere and takes the form of a wavetrain that passes over\nIndian landmass into the subtropics, reaching across the Pacific to North\nAmerica. In boreal winter, the eastward mode consists of a subtropically\nconfined rotational quadrupole along with midlatitudinal disturbances. Thus, in\naddition to circumnavigating westward Rossby waves, slow eastward propagating\nmodes appear to be a robust feature of the shallow water system with\ninteractive moisture in the presence of saturation fields that vary with\nlatitude and longitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 10:47:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 10:01:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 14:53:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

We present\nwork on the annotation and extraction of what we term potentially idiomatic\nexpressions (PIEs), a subclass of multiword expressions covering both literal\nand non-literal uses of idiomatic expressions. Existing corpora of PIEs are\nsmall and have limited coverage of different PIE types, which hampers research.\nTo further progress on the extraction and disambiguation of potentially\nidiomatic expressions, larger corpora of PIEs are required. In addition, larger\ncorpora are a potential source for valuable linguistic insights into idiomatic\nexpressions and their variability. We propose automatic tools to facilitate the\nbuilding of larger PIE corpora, by investigating the feasibility of using\ndictionary-based extraction of PIEs as a pre-extraction tool for English. We do\nthis by assessing the reliability and coverage of idiom dictionaries, the\nannotation of a PIE corpus, and the automatic extraction of PIEs from a large\ncorpus. Results show that combinations of dictionaries are a reliable source of\nidiomatic expressions, that PIEs can be annotated with a high reliability\n(0.74-0.91 Fleiss' Kappa), and that parse-based PIE extraction yields highly\naccurate performance (88% F1-score). Combining complementary PIE extraction\nmethods increases reliability further, to over 92% F1-score. Moreover, the\nextraction method presented here could be extended to other types of multiword\nexpressions and to other languages, given that sufficient NLP tools are\navailable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 11:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

All such algae spin\nabout a body-fixed axis as they swim; directional photosensors on each cell\nthus receive periodic signals when that axis is not aligned with the light. The\nflagella of $Chlamydomonas$ and $Volvox$ both exhibit an adaptive response to\nsuch signals in a manner that allows for accurate phototaxis, but in the former\nthe two flagella have distinct responses, while the thousands of flagella on\nthe surface of spherical $Volvox$ colonies have essentially identical\nbehaviour. The planar 16-cell species $Gonium~pectorale$ thus presents a\nconundrum, for its central 4 cells have a $Chlamydomonas$-like beat that\nprovide propulsion normal to the plane, while its 12 peripheral cells generate\nrotation around the normal through a $Volvox$-like beat. Here, we combine\nexperiment, theory, and computations to reveal how $Gonium$, perhaps the\nsimplest differentiated colonial organism, achieves phototaxis. High-resolution\ncell tracking, particle image velocimetry of flagellar driven flows, and\nhigh-speed imaging of flagella on micropipette-held colonies show how, in the\ncontext of a recently introduced model for $Chlamydomonas$ phototaxis, an\nadaptive response of the peripheral cells alone leads to photo-reorientation of\nthe entire colony. The analysis also highlights the importance of local\nvariations in flagellar beat dynamics within a given colony, which can lead to\nenhanced reorientation dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 11:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

Unlike in Taxi on Demand (ToD)\nservices -- where a vehicle is only assigned one passenger at a time -- in\non-demand ride-pooling, each (possibly partially filled) vehicle can be\nassigned a group of passenger requests with multiple different origin and\ndestination pairs. To ensure near real-time response, existing solutions to the\nreal-time ride-pooling problem are myopic in that they optimise the objective\n(e.g., maximise the number of passengers served) for the current time step\nwithout considering its effect on future assignments. This is because even a\nmyopic assignment in ride-pooling involves considering what combinations of\npassenger requests that can be assigned to vehicles, which adds a layer of\ncombinatorial complexity to the ToD problem.\n  A popular approach that addresses the limitations of myopic assignments in\nToD problems is Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP). Existing ADP methods for\nToD can only handle Linear Program (LP) based assignments, however, while the\nassignment problem in ride-pooling requires an Integer Linear Program (ILP)\nwith bad LP relaxations. To this end, our key technical contribution is in\nproviding a general ADP method that can learn from ILP-based assignments.\nAdditionally, we handle the extra combinatorial complexity from combinations of\npassenger requests by using a Neural Network based approximate value function\nand show a connection to Deep Reinforcement Learning that allows us to learn\nthis value-function with increased stability and sample-efficiency.

Under net neutrality, ISPs are compelled\nto charge all content providers (CPs) the same per Gbps rate despite the\ngrowing profit achieved by CPs. In this paper, we study the impact of the\nrepeal of net neutrality on communication networks by developing a\ntechno-economic Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to maximize the\npotential profit ISPs can achieve by offering their services to CPs. We focus\non video delivery as video traffic accounts for 78% of the cloud traffic. We\nconsider an ISP that offers CPs different classes of service representing\ntypical video content qualities including standard definition (SD), high\ndefinition (HD) and ultra-high definition (UHD) video. The MILP model maximizes\nthe ISP profit by optimizing the prices of the different classes according to\nthe users demand sensitivity to the change in price, referred to as Price\nElasticity of Demand (PED). We analyze how PED impacts the profit in different\nCP delivery scenarios in cloud-fog architectures. The results show that the\nrepeal of net neutrality can potentially increase ISPs profit by a factor of 8\nwith a pricing scheme that discriminates against data intensive content. Also,\nthe repeal of net neutrality positively impacts the network energy efficiency\nby reducing the core network power consumption by 55% as a result of\nsuppressing data intensive content compared to the net neutrality scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 12:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

However,\nbecause of the presence of error floor due to cycles and stopping sets in the\nfactor graph, the performance of the BP decoder is far from the performance of\nstate of the art cyclic redundancy check (CRC) aided successive cancellation\nlist (CA-SCL) decoders. It has been shown that successive BP decoding on\nmultiple permuted factor graphs, which is called the multi-trellis BP decoder,\ncan improve the error performance. However, when permuting the entire factor\ngraph, since the decoder dismisses the information from the previous\npermutation, the number of iterations required is significantly larger than\nthat of the standard BP decoder. In this work, we propose a new variant of the\nmulti-trellis BP decoder which permutes only a subgraph of the original factor\ngraph. This enables the decoder to retain information of variable nodes in the\nsubgraphs, which are not permuted, reducing the required number of iterations\nneeded in-between the permutations. As a result, the proposed decoder can\nperform permutations more frequently, hence being more effective in mitigating\nthe effect of cycles which cause oscillation errors. Experimental results show\nthat for a polar code with block length 1024 and rate 0.5 the error performance\ngain of the proposed decoder at the frame error rate of 10^(-6) is 0.25 dB\ncompared to multi-trellis decoder based on full permutations.

In particular, gapped Dirac nodes can\npossess large spin Berry curvatures and thus give rise to large spin Hall\neffect (SHE) and spin Nernst effect (SNE), which may be used to generate pure\nspin current for spintronics and spin caloritronics without applied magnetic\nfield or magnetic material. In this paper we study both SHE and SNE in ZrXY (X\n= Si, Ge; Y = S, Se, Te) based on \\textit{ab initio} relativistic band\nstructure calculations. Our theoretical calculations reveal that some of these\ncompounds exhibit large intrinsic spin Hall conductivity (SHC) and spin Nernst\nconductivity (SNC). The calculated SHC of ZrSiTe is as large as -755\n($\\hbar$/e)(S/cm). Since the electric conductivity of these Dirac semimetals\nare much smaller than that of platinum which has the largest intrinsic SHC of\n$\\sim$2200 ($\\hbar$/e)(S/cm), this indicates that they will have a larger spin\nHall angle than that of platinum. Remarkably, we find that both the magnitude\nand sign of the SHE and SNE in these compounds can be significantly tuned by\nchanging either the electric field direction or spin current direction and may\nalso be optimized by slightly varying the Fermi level via chemical doping.\nAnalysis of the calculated band- and $k$-resolved spin Berry curvatures show\nthat the large SHE and SNE as well as their remarkable tunabilities originate\nfrom the presence of many slightly spin-orbit coupling-gapped Dirac nodal lines\nnear the Fermi level in these Dirac semimetals. Our findings suggest that the\nZrSiS-type compounds are promising candidates for spintronic and spin\ncaloritronic devices, and will certainly stimulate further experiments on these\nDirac semimetals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 13:35:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

In this paper, we propose a module named Differentiable Binarization\n(DB), which can perform the binarization process in a segmentation network.\nOptimized along with a DB module, a segmentation network can adaptively set the\nthresholds for binarization, which not only simplifies the post-processing but\nalso enhances the performance of text detection.

The emission from GRBs\ncomprises a short (typically tens of seconds) and bright prompt emission,\nfollowed by a much longer afterglow phase. During the afterglow phase, the\nshocked outflow -- produced by the interaction between the ejected matter and\nthe circumburst medium -- slows down, and a gradual decrease in brightness is\nobserved. GRBs typically emit most of their energy via gamma-rays with energies\nin the kiloelectronvolt-to-megaelectronvolt range, but a few photons with\nenergies of tens of gigaelectronvolts have been detected by space-based\ninstruments. However, the origins of such high-energy (above one\ngigaelectronvolt) photons and the presence of very-high-energy (more than 100\ngigaelectronvolts) emission have remained elussive. Here we report observations\nof very-high-energy emission in the bright GRB 180720B deep in the GRB\nafterglow -ten hours after the end of the prompt emission phase, when the X-ray\nflux had already decayed by four orders of magnitude. Two possible explanations\nexist for the observed radiation: inverse Compton emission and synchrotron\nemission of ultrarelativistic electrons. Our observations show that the energy\nfluxes in the X-ray and gamma-ray range and their photon indices remain\ncomparable to each other throughout the afterglow. This discovery places\ndistinct constraints on the GRB environment for both emission mechanisms, with\nthe inverse Compton explanation alleviating the particle energy requirements\nfor the emission observed at late times. The late timing of this detection has\nconsequences for the future observations of GRBs at the highest energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 15:20:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

We evaluate several leading\nvariants spanning the Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, and RetinaNet architectures to\nexplore the transferability of such models between varying X-ray scanners with\ndiffering imaging geometries, image resolutions and material colour profiles.\nWhilst the limited availability of X-ray threat imagery can pose a challenge,\nwe employ a transfer learning approach to evaluate whether such inter-scanner\ngeneralisation may exist over a multiple class detection problem. Overall, we\nachieve maximal detection performance using a Faster R-CNN architecture with a\nResNet$_{101}$ classification network, obtaining 0.88 and 0.86 of mean Average\nPrecision (mAP) for a three-class and two class item from varying X-ray imaging\nsources.

Not only are the gradients prograde, but their\n$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}$\ncoefficients follow galactic shear in sign, although with a lower amplitude. No\nlink is found between the orientation of the gradient and the orientation of\nthe cloud. The values of the cloud angular momenta appear to be an extension of\nthe values noted for galactic clouds despite the orders of magnitude difference\nin cloud mass. Roughly 30\\% of the clouds show retrograde velocity gradients.\nFor a strictly rising rotation curve, as in M~51, gravitational contraction\nwould be expected to yield strictly prograde rotators within an axisymmetric\npotential. In M~51, the fraction of retrograde rotators is found to be higher\nin the spiral arms than in the disk as a whole. Along the leading edge of the\nspiral arms, a majority of the clouds are retrograde rotators. While this work\nshould be continued on other nearby galaxies, the M~33 and M~51 studies have\nshown that clouds rotate and that they rotate mostly prograde, although the\namplitudes are not such that rotational energy is a significant support\nmechanism against gravitation. In this work, we show that retrograde rotation\nis linked to the presence of a spiral gravitational potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 15:43:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-25"}

The prevailing idea to solve this task is composed of a\nsequence of steps and is dependent on the success of several pipelines in its\nexecution. To overcome such limitations with the existing algorithm, we propose\na unified approach to solve this problem. We assume that a dynamic scene can be\napproximated by numerous piecewise planar surfaces, where each planar surface\nenjoys its own rigid motion, and the global change in the scene between two\nframes is as-rigid-as-possible (ARAP). Consequently, our model of a dynamic\nscene reduces to a soup of planar structures and rigid motion of these local\nplanar structures. Using planar over-segmentation of the scene, we reduce this\ntask to solving a \"3D jigsaw puzzle\" problem. Hence, the task boils down to\ncorrectly assemble each rigid piece to construct a 3D shape that complies with\nthe geometry of the scene under the ARAP assumption. Further, we show that our\napproach provides an effective solution to the inherent scale-ambiguity in\nstructure-from-motion under perspective projection.

However, the problem has\nbeen considered as a subset of the object segmentation problem and less handled\nin the semantic segmentation field. Obviously, portrait segmentation has its\nunique requirements. First, because the portrait segmentation is performed in\nthe middle of a whole process of many real-world applications, it requires\nextremely lightweight models. Second, there has not been any public datasets in\nthis domain that contain a sufficient number of images with unbiased\nstatistics. To solve the first problem, we introduce the new extremely\nlightweight portrait segmentation model SINet, containing an information\nblocking decoder and spatial squeeze modules. The information blocking decoder\nuses confidence estimates to recover local spatial information without spoiling\nglobal consistency. The spatial squeeze module uses multiple receptive fields\nto cope with various sizes of consistency in the image. To tackle the second\nproblem, we propose a simple method to create additional portrait segmentation\ndata which can improve accuracy on the EG1800 dataset. In our qualitative and\nquantitative analysis on the EG1800 dataset, we show that our method\noutperforms various existing lightweight segmentation models.

This transformation\nmay be temporal (for example frame dropping, change in frame rate) or spatial\n(brightness and contrast change, addition of noise etc.) in nature although the\nprimary focus of this report is detecting temporal attacks. The video hashing\nmethod proposed by us uses a deep learning neural network to learn variable\nlength binary hash codes for the entire video considering both temporal and\nspatial features into account.

Therefore, we implemented a formal ontology as a resource to\nallow the mental health community to facilitate data integration and knowledge\nmodeling and to improve ACEs surveillance and research.\n  Methods: We use advanced knowledge representation and Semantic Web tools and\ntechniques to implement the ontology. The current implementation of the\nontology is expressed in the description logic ALCRIQ(D), a sublogic of Web\nOntology Language (OWL 2).\n  Results: The ACEs Ontology has been implemented and made available to the\nmental health community and the public via the BioPortal repository. Moreover,\nmultiple use-case scenarios have been introduced to showcase and evaluate the\nusability of the ontology in action. The ontology was created to be used by\nmajor actors in the ACEs community with different applications, from the\ndiagnosis of individuals and predicting potential negative outcomes that they\nmight encounter to the prevention of ACEs in a population and designing\ninterventions and policies.\n  Conclusions: The ACEs Ontology provides a uniform and reusable semantic\nnetwork and an integrated knowledge structure for mental health practitioners\nand researchers to improve ACEs surveillance and evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-12"}

Recently, integrating nanophotonic motion readout with\nmicro- and nano-mechanical resonators allowed practical chip-scale sensors to\nroutinely operate near this limit in high-bandwidth measurements. However, the\nexact and general expressions for either thermodynamic frequency measurement\nuncertainty or efficient, real-time frequency estimators are not well\nestablished, particularly for fast and weakly-driven resonators. Here, we\nderive, and numerically validate, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and an\nefficient maximum-likelihood estimator for the frequency of a classical linear\nharmonic oscillator subject to thermodynamic fluctuations. For a fluctuating\noscillator without external drive, the frequency Allan deviation calculated\nfrom simulated resonator motion data agrees with the derived CRLB $\\sigma_f =\n{1 \\over 2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\Gamma \\over 2\\tau}$ for averaging times $\\tau$ below, as\nwell as above, the relaxation time $1\\over\\Gamma$. The CRLB approach is general\nand can be extended to driven resonators, non-negligible motion detection\nimprecision, as well as backaction from a continuous linear quantum\nmeasurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 02:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}
