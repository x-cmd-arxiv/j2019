However, in order to prove lower bounds in algebraic\ncomplexity theory, considering group orbits is not enough.\n  In this paper we tighten the relationship between the orbit of the power sum\npolynomial and its closure, so that we can separate this orbit closure from the\norbit closure of the product of variables by just considering the symmetry\ngroups of both polynomials and their representation theoretic decomposition\ncoefficients. In a natural way our construction yields a multiplicity\nobstruction that is neither an occurrence obstruction, nor a so-called\nvanishing ideal occurrence obstruction. All multiplicity obstructions so far\nhave been of one of these two types.\n  Our paper is the first implementation of the ambitious approach that was\noriginally suggested in the first papers on geometric complexity theory by\nMulmuley and Sohoni (SIAM J Comput 2001, 2008): Before our paper, all existence\nproofs of obstructions only took into account the symmetry group of one of the\ntwo polynomials (or tensors) that were to be separated. In our paper the\nmultiplicity obstruction is obtained by comparing the representation theoretic\ndecomposition coefficients of both symmetry groups.\n  Our proof uses a semi-explicit description of the coordinate ring of the\norbit closure of the power sum polynomial in terms of Young tableaux, which\nenables its comparison to the coordinate ring of the orbit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Nov 2019 20:08:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

The stand-alone C++ code we have developed can train new MLP's on new\ntraining sets, within minutes to hours, depending upon the dimensions of input\nspectra and desired output. After the MLP is trained, it can classify new input\nspectra within a second, potentially helping speed observation and mission\ndesign planning. Four of the MLP's were tuned to work with various levels of\nspectral noise. The fifth MLP was developed for cases where the user is\nuncertain about the noise level. The MLP's were trained using a grid of model\nspectra that varied in metallicity, gravity, temperature, and cloud properties.\nWe tested the MLP on noisy models and observed spectra of both Jupiter and\nSaturn.

The radio\nmorphology of this SNR is asymmetrical with two bright regions towards the\nnorth-west and south-west of the central location as defined by radio emission.\n  N 103B identified features include: a radio spectral index of -0.75+-0.01\n(consistent with other young type Ia SNRs in the Galaxy); a bulk SNR expansion\nrate as in X-rays; morphology and polarised electrical field vector\nmeasurements where we note radial polarisation peak towards the north-west of\nthe remnant at both 5500 and 9000 MHz.

Given the data-intensive feeds in real life\n(e.g., high-frequency price updates) and the high cost in using blockchain,\nnamely Gas, it is imperative to reduce the Gas cost of data feeds. Motivated by\nthe constant-changing workloads in finance and other applications, this work\nfocuses on designing a dynamic, workload-aware approach for cost effectiveness\nin Gas. This design space is understudied in the existing blockchain research\nwhich has so far focused on static data placement.\n  This work presents GRuB, a cost-effective data feed that dynamically\nreplicates data between the blockchain and an off-chain cloud storage. GRuB's\ndata replication is workload-adaptive by monitoring the current workload and\nmaking online decisions w.r.t. data replication. A series of online algorithms\nare proposed that achieve the bounded worst-case cost in blockchain's Gas. GRuB\nruns the decision-making components on the untrusted cloud off-chain for lower\nGas costs, and employs a security protocol to authenticate the data transferred\nbetween the blockchain and cloud. The overall GRuB system can autonomously\nachieve low Gas costs with changing workloads.\n  We built a GRuB prototype functional with Ethereum and Google LevelDB, and\nsupported real applications in stablecoins. Under real workloads collected from\nthe Ethereum contract-call history and mixed workloads of YCSB, we\nsystematically evaluate GRuB's cost which shows a saving of Gas by 10% ~ 74%,\nwith comparison to the baselines of static data-placement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 05:08:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 02:03:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 23:10:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

A self-consistent spectrum-SED\ndecomposition method, which constrains stellar population properties in SED\nmodeling based on spectral fitting results, has been employed for 149 ULIRGs\nwhose optical continua are dominated by host galaxies. They are massive\ngalaxies ($M_{\\rm star}\\sim10^{11}$-$10^{12}$ M$_{\\odot}$), associated with\nintense star formation activities (SFR $\\sim$ 200-2000 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$).\nThe sample covers a range of AGN bolometric luminosity of $10^{10}$-$10^{13}$\nL$_{\\odot}$, and the outflow velocity measured from [OIII] 5007A line shows a\ncorrelation with AGN luminosity. Eight galaxies show extremely fast outflows\nwith velocity up to 1500-2000 km s$^{-1}$. However, the co-existence of\nvigorous starbursts and strong outflows suggests the star formation has not\nbeen quenched during the ULIRG phase. By deriving stellar mass and mass\nfraction of young stellar population, we find no significant discrepancies\nbetween stellar properties of ULIRGs with weak and powerful AGNs. The results\nare not consistent with the merger-induced evolutionary scenario, which\npredicts that SF-dominated ULIRGs show smaller stellar mass and younger stellar\npopulations compared to AGN-dominated ULIRGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 06:08:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 05:51:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 10:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

In this paper, we propose a model called REDA (latent\nRelation Embedding with Dual Attentions) to address this challenge.

Methods to characterize radial velocity\nperiodograms assume that peaks from magnetic active regions will typically\noccur at the stellar rotation period or a related harmonic. However, with\nsurface features unevenly spaced and evolving over time, signals from magnetic\nactivity are not perfectly periodic, and the effectiveness of characterizing\nthem with sine curves is unconfirmed. With a series of simulations, we perform\nthe first test of common assumptions about signals from magnetic active regions\nin radial velocity periodograms.

As test cases, we apply our analysis to two exoplanet hosts,\nKepler-20 and K2-131.

For example, the recently developed Tile\nLow-Rank approximation (TLR) method involves many tuning parameters, including\nnumerical accuracy. To properly choose the tuning parameters, it is crucial to\nadopt a meaningful criterion for the assessment of the prediction efficiency\nwith different inputs, which the most commonly-used Mean Square Prediction\nError (MSPE) criterion and the Kullback-Leibler Divergence criterion cannot\nfully describe.

It introduces\nan external cost to a system by requiring computational effort to perform\nactions. However, since its inception, a central challenge was to tune this\ncost. Initial designs for deterring spam email and DoS attacks applied overhead\nequally to honest participants and attackers. Requiring too little effort did\nnot deter attacks, whereas too much encumbered honest participation. This might\nbe the reason it was never widely adopted.\n  Nakamoto overcame this trade-off in Bitcoin by distinguishing desired from\nmalicious behavior and introducing internal rewards for the former. This\nsolution gained popularity in securing cryptocurrencies and using the virtual\ninternally-minted tokens for rewards. However, in existing blockchain protocols\nthe internal rewards fund (almost) the same value of external expenses. Thus,\nas the token value soars, so does the PoW expenditure. Bitcoin PoW, for\nexample, already expends as much electricity as Colombia or Switzerland. This\namount of resource-guzzling is unsustainable and hinders even wider adoption of\nthese systems.\n  In this work we present Hybrid Expenditure Blockchain (HEB), a novel PoW\nmechanism. HEB is a generalization of Nakamoto's protocol that enables tuning\nthe external expenditure by introducing a complementary internal-expenditure\nmechanism. Thus, for the first time, HEB decouples external expenditure from\nthe reward value.\n  We show a practical parameter choice by which HEB requires significantly less\nexternal consumption compare to Nakamoto's protocol, its resilience against\nrational attackers is similar, and it retains the decentralized and\npermissionless nature of the system.

However, many\nexisting GCN methods provide a pre-defined graph and fix it through the entire\nnetwork, which can loss implicit joint correlations. Besides, the mainstream\nspectral GCN is approximated by one-order hop, thus higher-order connections\nare not well involved. Therefore, huge efforts are required to explore a better\nGCN architecture. To address these problems, we turn to Neural Architecture\nSearch (NAS) and propose the first automatically designed GCN for\nskeleton-based action recognition. Specifically, we enrich the search space by\nproviding multiple dynamic graph modules after fully exploring the\nspatial-temporal correlations between nodes. Besides, we introduce multiple-hop\nmodules and expect to break the limitation of representational capacity caused\nby one-order approximation. Moreover, a sampling- and memory-efficient\nevolution strategy is proposed to search an optimal architecture for this task.\nThe resulted architecture proves the effectiveness of the higher-order\napproximation and the dynamic graph modeling mechanism with temporal\ninteractions, which is barely discussed before. To evaluate the performance of\nthe searched model, we conduct extensive experiments on two very large scaled\ndatasets and the results show that our model gets the state-of-the-art results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 08:24:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

The two-body PMF shows that a bidisperse\ndistribution of free polymer chains increases the strength of attraction\nbetween a pair of ungrafted NPs. If the NPs are grafted by polymer chains, the\neffective interaction crucially depends on bidispersity and grafting density of\nthe polymer chains: for low grafting densities, the bidispersity of both free\nand grafted chains increases the repulsion between the NPs, whereas for high\ngrafting densities we observe two different effects. An increase of\nbidispersity in free chains causes the rise of the repulsion between the NPs,\nwhile an increase of bidispersity in grafted chains promotes the rise of\nattraction. Additionally, a proper treatment of multi-body interactions\nimproves the simpler two-body PMF calculations, in both unimodal and bimodal\ncases. We found that, by properly tuning the bidispersity of both free and\ngrafted chains, we can control the structure of the composite materials, which\ncan be confirmed by experimental observations. As a result, the hybrid\nparticle-field approach is confirmed to be a valid tool for reproducing and\npredicting microscopic interactions, which determine the stability of the\nmicroscopic structure of the composite in a wide range of conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 09:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no\nstudy on leveraging such stabilizing term in IRL algorithm framework to solve\noptimal trajectory tracking problems for continuous time nonlinear systems with\nactuator constraints. To this end a novel update law leveraging the stabilizing\nterm along with variable gain gradient descent in IRL framework is presented in\nthis paper.

Another salient feature of the presented update law is its variable\nlearning rate, which scales the pace of learning based on instantaneous\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman error and rate of variation of Lyapunov function along\nthe system trajectories.

Elastic-constant\nand intrinsic hardness calculations show that oxidation does not degrade the\nmechanical properties of V0.5Mo0.5N. Electronic structure analyses indicate\nthat the presence of oxygen reduces the covalent bond character, which slightly\nlowers the alloy strength and intrinsic hardness. Nevertheless, the character\nof metallic d-d states, which are crucial for allowing plastic deformation and\nenhancing toughness, remains unaffected. Overall, our results suggest that\nVMoNO oxynitrides, with oxygen concentrations as high as 50%, possess high\nintrinsic hardness, while still being ductile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 10:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

Traditionally this has\nbeen accomplished using template matching. However, template matching is\nnotoriously brittle in the face of changes in appearance caused by, for\nexample, variations in viewpoint, partial occlusion, and non-rigid\ndeformations. This article tests a method of template matching that is more\ntolerant to such changes in appearance and that can, therefore, more accurately\nidentify image patches. In traditional template matching the comparison between\na template and the image is independent of the other templates. In contrast,\nthe method advocated here takes into account the evidence provided by the image\nfor the template at each location and the full range of alternative\nexplanations represented by the same template at other locations and by other\ntemplates. Specifically, the proposed method of template matching is performed\nusing a form of probabilistic inference known as \"explaining away\". The\nalgorithm used to implement explaining away has previously been used to\nsimulate several neurobiological mechanisms, and been applied to image contour\ndetection and pattern recognition tasks.

On the other hand, in the stronger-field regime,\nmultiple plateaus emerge and the $m$-th cut-off scales as $\\epsilon_{\\rm\ncut,m}=U + m E_0$. We show that this difference originates from the different\ndynamics of the doublons and holons in the weak- and strong-field regimes. We\nalso comment on the similarities and differences between HHG from Mott\ninsulators and from semiconductors. This proceedings paper complements our\nrecent work, Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 057405 (2018), with additional results and\nanalyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 11:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Existing solutions for GBDT with\ndifferential privacy suffer from the significant accuracy loss due to too loose\nsensitivity bounds and ineffective privacy budget allocations (especially\nacross different trees in the GBDT model). Loose sensitivity bounds lead to\nmore noise to obtain a fixed privacy level. Ineffective privacy budget\nallocations worsen the accuracy loss especially when the number of trees is\nlarge. Therefore, we propose a new GBDT training algorithm that achieves\ntighter sensitivity bounds and more effective noise allocations.

These works give\nobservational support to the C18O selective photodissociation due to the\ninteraction between the FUV radiation and the molecular gas. It is necessary to\nincrease the sample of molecular clouds located at different distances and\naffected in different ways by nearby or embedded HII regions and OB\nassociations to study the selective photodissociation. Using 12CO, 13CO, and\nC18O J=1-0 data obtained from the FOREST Survey, we analyze the filamentary\ninfrared dark cloud IRDC34.43+0.24 located at the distance of about 3.9 kpc.\nThis IRDC is related to several HII regions and YSOs. Assuming LTE we obtain:\n0.8x10^16<N(13CO)<4x10^17cm^-2, 0.6x10^15<N(C18O)<4.4x10^16cm^-2, and 3<X<30\nacross the whole IRDC. Larger values of X were found towards portions of the\ncloud related to the HII regions associated with the N61 and N62 bubbles and\nwith the photodissociation regions (PDRs), precisely the regions in which FUV\nphotons are strongly interacting with the molecular gas. Our result represents\nan observational support to the C18O selectively photodissociation phenomenon\noccurring in a quite distant filamentary IRDC. Additionally, based on IR data\nfrom the Hi-GAL survey, the FUV radiation field was estimated in Habing units,\nand the dust temperature and N(H2) distribution was studied. Using the average\nof N(H2), values in close agreement with the canonical abundance ratios\n[H2]/[13CO] and [H2]/[C18O] were derived. However, the obtained ranges in the\nabundance ratios show that if an accurate analysis of the molecular gas is\nrequired, the use of the canonical values may introduce some bias. Thus, it is\nimportant to consider how the gas is irradiated by the far ultraviolet photons\nacross the molecular cloud. The analysis of X is a good tool to perform that.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 13:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Previous studies\nhave proposed the use of transfer learning approaches to overcome the above\ndifficulty. These approaches benefit from weakly supervised training data, such\nas ASR speech-to-transcript or MT text-to-text translation pairs. However, the\nparameters in these models are updated independently of each task, which may\nlead to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we adopt a meta-learning algorithm\nto train a modality agnostic multi-task model that transfers knowledge from\nsource tasks=ASR+MT to target task=ST where ST task severely lacks data. In the\nmeta-learning phase, the parameters of the model are exposed to vast amounts of\nspeech transcripts (e.g., English ASR) and text translations (e.g.,\nEnglish-German MT). During this phase, parameters are updated in such a way to\nunderstand speech, text representations, the relation between them, as well as\nact as a good initialization point for the target ST task. We evaluate the\nproposed meta-learning approach for ST tasks on English-German (En-De) and\nEnglish-French (En-Fr) language pairs from the Multilingual Speech Translation\nCorpus (MuST-C). Our method outperforms the previous transfer learning\napproaches and sets new state-of-the-art results for En-De and En-Fr ST tasks\nby obtaining 9.18, and 11.76 BLEU point improvements, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 14:03:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 03:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

In the considered scenario, multiple base\nstations collaborate with each other to serve a single user, referred to as the\nCoMP user, which is the same as for conventional CoMP. However, unlike\nconventional CoMP, each base station in N-NOMA opportunistically serves an\nextra user, referred to as the NOMA user, while serving the CoMP user at the\nsame bandwidth. The CoMP user is typically located far from the base stations,\nwhereas users close to the base stations are scheduled as NOMA users. Hence,\nthe channel conditions of the two kind of users are very distinctive, which\nfacilitates the implementation of NOMA. Compared to the conventional orthogonal\nmultiple access based CoMP scheme, where multiple base stations serve a single\nCoMP user only, the proposed N-NOMA scheme can support larger connectivity by\nserving the extra NOMA users, and improve the spectral efficiency by avoiding\nthe CoMP user solely occupying the spectrum. A stochastic geometry approach is\napplied to model the considered N-NOMA scenario as a Poisson cluster process,\nbased on which closed-form analytical expressions for outage probabilities and\nergodic rates are obtained. Numerical results are presented to show the\naccuracy of the analytical results and also demonstrate the superior\nperformance of the proposed N-NOMA scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 14:16:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 20:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}

In contrast to what has been suggested for this pulsar in\nthe past, this, plus other differences in the polarization of the modulated\nemission observed for the two drift modes, suggests that a drift mode change is\nmore than a change in the underlying carousel radius and that magnetospheric\npropagation effects play an important role.

Predictive models are often developed using biased\ndatasets and thus retain or even exacerbate biases in their decisions and\nrecommendations. Removing the sensitive covariates, such as gender or race, is\ninsufficient to remedy this issue since the biases may be retained due to other\nrelated covariates. We present a regularization approach to this problem that\ntrades off predictive accuracy of the learned models (with respect to biased\nlabels) for the fairness in terms of statistical parity, i.e. independence of\nthe decisions from the sensitive covariates. In particular, we consider a\ngeneral framework of regularized empirical risk minimization over reproducing\nkernel Hilbert spaces and impose an additional regularizer of dependence\nbetween predictors and sensitive covariates using kernel-based measures of\ndependence, namely the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) and its\nnormalized version. This approach leads to a closed-form solution in the case\nof squared loss, i.e. ridge regression. Moreover, we show that the dependence\nregularizer has an interpretation as modifying the corresponding Gaussian\nprocess (GP) prior. As a consequence, a GP model with a prior that encourages\nfairness to sensitive variables can be derived, allowing principled\nhyperparameter selection and studying of the relative relevance of covariates\nunder fairness constraints.

Recently, the effect of destructive QI (DQI) on\nthe electrical conductance of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) has been\ninvestigated. Here, through a combined experimental and theoretical\ninvestigation, we demonstrate chemical control of different forms of\nconstructive QI (CQI) in cross-plane transport through SAMs and assess its\ninfluence on cross-plane thermoelectricity in SAMs. It is known that the\nelectrical conductance of single molecules can be controlled in a deterministic\nmanner, by chemically varying their connectivity to external electrodes. Here,\nby employing synthetic methodologies to vary the connectivity of terminal\nanchor groups around aromatic anthracene cores, and by forming SAMs of the\nresulting molecules, we clearly demonstrate that this signature of CQI can be\ntranslated into SAM-on-gold molecular films.

Recently, an increasing emphasis on\nmachine-learning applications has led to a significant contribution to the\nfield of gait analysis, e.g., in increasing the classification performance. In\norder to ensure the generalizability of the machine-learning models, different\ndata preprocessing steps are usually carried out to process the measured raw\ndata before the classifications. In the past, various methods have been used\nfor each of these preprocessing steps. However, there are hardly any standard\nprocedures or rather systematic comparisons of these different methods and\ntheir impact on the classification performance. Therefore, the aim of this\nanalysis is to compare different combinations of commonly applied data\npreprocessing steps and test their effects on the classification performance of\ngait patterns. A publicly available dataset on intra-individual changes of gait\npatterns was used for this analysis. Forty-two healthy participants performed 6\nsessions of 15 gait trials for 1 day. For each trial, two force plates recorded\nthe 3D ground reaction forces (GRFs). The data was preprocessed with the\nfollowing steps: GRF filtering, time derivative, time normalization, data\nreduction, weight normalization and data scaling. Subsequently, combinations of\nall methods from each preprocessing step were analyzed by comparing their\nprediction performance in a six-session classification using Support Vector\nMachines, Random Forest Classifiers, Multi-Layer Perceptrons, and Convolutional\nNeural Networks. In conclusion, the present results provide first\ndomain-specific recommendations for commonly applied data preprocessing methods\nand might help to build more comparable and more robust classification models\nbased on machine learning that are suitable for a practical application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 15:27:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 15:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-31"}

Thus, a quantum system must be described relative\nto a quantum reference frame (QRF). Further requirements on QRF include using\nonly relational observables and not assuming the existence of external\nreference frame. To address these requirements, two approaches are proposed in\nthe literature. The first one is an operational approach (F. Giacomini, et al,\nNat. Comm. 10:494, 2019) which focuses on the quantization of transformation\nbetween QRFs. The second approach attempts to derive the quantum transformation\nbetween QRFs from first principles (A. Vanrietvelde, et al, \\textit{Quantum}\n4:225, 2020). Such first principle approach describes physical systems as\nsymmetry induced constrained Hamiltonian systems. The Dirac quantization of\nsuch systems before removing redundancy is interpreted as perspective-neutral\ndescription. Then, a systematic redundancy reduction procedure is introduced to\nderive description from perspective of a QRF. The first principle approach\nrecovers some of the results from the operational approach, but not yet include\nan important part of a quantum theory - the measurement theory. This paper is\nintended to bridge the gap. We show that the von Neumann quantum measurement\ntheory can be embedded into the perspective-neutral framework. This allows us\nto successfully recover the results found in the operational approach, with the\nadvantage that the transformation operator can be derived from the first\nprinciple. In addition, the formulation presented here reveals several\ninteresting conceptual insights. For instance, the projection operation in\nmeasurement needs to be performed after redundancy reduction. These results\nrepresent one step forward in understanding how quantum measurement should be\nformulated when the reference frame is also a quantum system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 07:14:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 07:13:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 06:35:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2020 05:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-02"}

The timelike radial geodesics are\ncomputed in the conformally-flat spacetime in double-null coordinates and\nproves to be hyperbolae in the region $r>t$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Nov 2019 19:32:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-22"}

The\nsolutions of the equations obtained for the case of spaces defined by the\nFriedman-Robertson-Walker metric, as well as for a centrally symmetric space\nare investigated. In our model arise effective gravitational and cosmological\n\"constants\", which are defined by the \"mean square\" of the scalar fields. In\nobtained solutions the values of such parameters as \"Hubble parameter\",\ngravitational and cosmological \"constants\" in the RS stage fluctuate near\nmonotonically evolving mean values. These parameters are matched with\nobservational data, described as phenomena of dark energy and dark matter. The\nMTIG equations for the case of a centrally symmetric gravitational field, in\naddition to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter solutions, contain solutions that lead\nto the new physical effects at large distances from the center. The\nSchwarzschild-Sitter solution becomes unstable and enters the oscillatory\nregime. For distances greater than a certain critical value, the following\neffects can appear: deviation from General relativity and Newton's law of\ngravitational interaction, antigravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Nov 2019 20:45:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-22"}

One common technique is stereolithography, which has recently\nbeen augmented in response to modern demands to support smaller features,\nlarger build areas, and/or faster speeds. However, a limitation is that such\nsystems typically utilize a single-aperture imaging configuration, which\nrestricts their ability to produce microstructures at large volumes due to the\ntradeoff between the image resolution and image field area. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate three versatile imaging functions based on the coupling a planar\nlens array, namely, parallel image transfer, kaleidoscopic superposition, and\nintegral reconstruction, the combination of which is termed integral\nlithography. In this approach, the individual microlenses in the planar lens\narray maintain a high numerical aperture and are employed in the creation of\ndigital light patterns that can expand the printable area by the number of\nmicrolenses (103-104). The proposed lens array-based integral imaging system\nprovides the concurrent ability to scale-up and scale-down incoming image\nfields, thereby enabling the scalable stereolithographic fabrication of\nthree-dimensional features that surpass the resolution-to-area scaling limit.\nThe proposed system opens up new possibilities for producing periodic\nmicroarchitectures spanning four orders of magnitude from micrometers to\ncentimeters that can be applied to biological scaffolds, metastructures,\nchemical reactors, and functional surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Nov 2019 19:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-28"}
