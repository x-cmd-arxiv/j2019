We dissect our\ncontroller into two parts: 1. the anticipative mode, more immediately\nbeneficial when automated vehicle fleet penetration is low, and 2. the\nconnected mode, beneficial in coordinated car-following scenarios and high\nautomated vehicle penetrations appropriate for autonomous vehicle specific\napplications. Probabilistic constraints handle safety considerations, and\nvehicle constraints for acceleration capabilities are expressed through the use\nof powertrain maps. Real traffic scenarios are then modeled using time headway\ndistributions from traffic data. To study impact over a range of demands, we\nvary input vehicle volume from low to high and then vary automated vehicle\npenetration from low to high. When examining all-human driving scenarios,\nnetwork capacity failed to meet demand in high-volume scenarios, such as\nrush-hour traffic. We further find that with automated vehicles introduced\nwhich utilize probabilistic constraints to balance safety and traffic\ncompactness, network capacity was improved to support the high-volume\nscenarios. Finally, we examine energy efficiencies of the fleet for\nconventional, electric, and hybrid vehicles. We find that automated vehicles\nperform at a 10% - 20% higher energy efficiency over human drivers when\nconsidering conventional powertrains, and find that automated vehicles perform\nat a 3% - 9% higher energy efficiency over human drivers when considering\nelectric and hybrid powertrains. Due to secondary effects of smoothing traffic\nflow, energy benefits also apply to human-driven vehicles that interact with\nautomated ones. Such simulated humans were found to drive up to 10% more\nenergy-efficiently than they did in the baseline all-human scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2019 21:40:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 13:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-02"}

As an\nextension to the proposed scheme, distance-based formation centroid maneuvering\nis also studied for disturbance-free agents, in which the formation centroid\ntracks a desired time-varying velocity. The proposed control laws are\ndecentralized, in the sense that each agent employs local relative information\nregarding its neighbors to calculate its control signal.

In this work, we\nexplore a new theory proposed by Lee & Hennebelle (2018). The idea is that the\ntidal field around first Larson cores prevents the formation of other\ncollapsing clumps within a certain radius. The protostar can then freely\naccrete the gas within this radius. This leads to a peak mass of roughly $10 \\,\nM_{\\mathrm{1LC}}$, independent of the parent cloud properties. Using simple\nanalytical arguments, we derive a collapse condition for clumps located close\nto a protostar. We then study the tidal field and the corresponding collapse\ncondition using a series of numerical simulations. We find that the tidal field\naround protostars is indeed strong enough to prevent clumps from collapsing\nunless they have high enough densities. For each newly formed protostar, we\ndetermine the region in which tidal screening is dominant. We call this the\ntidal bubble. The mass within this bubble is our estimate for the final mass of\nthe star. Using this formalism, we are able to construct a very good prediction\nfor the final IMF in our simulations. Not only do we correctly predict the\npeak, but we are also able to reproduced the high and low mass end of the IMF.\nWe conclude that tidal forces are important in determining the final mass of a\nstar and might be the dominant effect in setting the peak mass of the IMF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2019 16:09:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

The present\npaper addresses this theoretical issue, considering first-order spherical\nharmonics approximation of general lighting. Two important theoretical results\nare established.

However, one key drawback\nof EI is that it is overly greedy in exploiting the fitted Gaussian process\nmodel for optimization, which results in suboptimal solutions even with large\nsample sizes. To address this, we propose a new hierarchical EI (HEI)\nframework, which makes use of a hierarchical Gaussian process model. HEI\npreserves a closed-form acquisition function, and corrects the over-greediness\nof EI by encouraging exploration of the optimization space. We then introduce\nhyperparameter estimation methods which allow HEI to mimic a fully Bayesian\noptimization procedure, while avoiding expensive Markov-chain Monte Carlo\nsampling steps. We prove the global convergence of HEI over a broad function\nspace, and establish near-minimax convergence rates under certain prior\nspecifications. Numerical experiments show the improvement of HEI over existing\nBayesian optimization methods, for synthetic functions and a semiconductor\nmanufacturing optimization problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2019 17:04:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 22:37:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 04:51:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 15:33:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-21"}

Without sufficient capital requirements for banks and other financial\ninstitutions, shocks that are locally confined at first can spread through the\nentire system and be significantly amplified by various contagion channels. The\naim of this thesis is thus to investigate in detail two selected contagion\nchannels of this so-called systemic risk, provide mathematical models and\nderive consequences for the systemic risk management of financial institutions.\nThe first contagion channel we consider is default contagion. The underlying\neffect is here that insolvent institutions cannot service their debt or other\nfinancial obligations anymore - at least partially. Debtors and other directly\nimpacted parties in the system are thus forced to write off their losses and\ncan possibly be driven into insolvency themselves due to their incurred\nfinancial losses. This on the other hand starts a new round in the default\ncontagion process. In our model we simplistically describe each institution by\nall the financial positions it is exposed to as well as its initial capital. In\ndoing so, our starting point is the work of Detering et al. (2017) - a model\nfor contagion in unweighted networks - which particularly considers the exact\nnetwork configuration to be random and derives asymptotic results for large\nnetworks. We extend this model such that weighted networks can be considered\nand an application to financial networks becomes possible. More precisely, for\nany given initial shock we deduce an explicit asymptotic expression for the\ntotal damage caused in the system by contagion and provide a necessary and\nsufficient criterion for an unshocked financial system to be stable against\nsmall shocks.

Training GCNs for a large graph, however, is still a challenge.\nOriginal full-batch GCN training requires calculating the representation of all\nthe nodes in the graph per GCN layer, which brings in high computation and\nmemory costs. To alleviate this issue, several sampling-based methods have been\nproposed to train GCNs on a subset of nodes. Among them, the node-wise\nneighbor-sampling method recursively samples a fixed number of neighbor nodes,\nand thus its computation cost suffers from exponential growing neighbor size;\nwhile the layer-wise importance-sampling method discards the neighbor-dependent\nconstraints, and thus the nodes sampled across layer suffer from sparse\nconnection problem. To deal with the above two problems, we propose a new\neffective sampling algorithm called LAyer-Dependent ImportancE Sampling\n(LADIES). Based on the sampled nodes in the upper layer, LADIES selects their\nneighborhood nodes, constructs a bipartite subgraph and computes the importance\nprobability accordingly. Then, it samples a fixed number of nodes by the\ncalculated probability, and recursively conducts such procedure per layer to\nconstruct the whole computation graph. We prove theoretically and\nexperimentally, that our proposed sampling algorithm outperforms the previous\nsampling methods in terms of both time and memory costs.

A fundamental assumption in BBN is that the nuclear\nvelocity distributions obey Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) statistics as they do in\nstars. Specifically, the BBN epoch is characterized by a dilute baryon plasma\nfor which the velocity distribution of nuclei is mainly determined by the\ndominant Coulomb elastic scattering with mildly relativistic electrons. One\nmust therefore deduce the momentum distribution for reacting nuclei from the\nmulti-component relativistic Boltzmann equation. However, the full\nmulti-component relativistic Boltzmann equation has only recently been analyzed\nand its solution has only been worked out in special cases.

Imitating the\nnatural responses to phosphene-like stimuli at different positions can help in\ndesigning a systematic procedure to determine these parameters. The key\ncharacteristic of such a system is the ability to discriminate between\nresponses to different positions in the visual field. While most previous\nprosthetic devices have targeted the primary visual cortex, the extrastriate\ncortex has the advantage of covering a large part of the visual field with a\nsmaller amount of cortical tissue, providing the possibility of a more compact\nimplant. Here, we studied how well ensembles of Multiunit activity (MUA) and\nLocal Field Potentials (LFPs) responses from extrastriate cortical visual area\nV4 of a behaving macaque monkey can discriminate between two-dimensional\nspatial positions.

We identified a\nselection procedure that could significantly increase the discrimination\nperformance while reducing the required number of electrodes.

In this\nwork, we take a step towards bridging this crucial gap, proposing the first\ntechnique to visually explain VAEs by means of gradient-based attention.

To address this need, we link the question of reliability of a\nmodel's individual prediction to the epistemic uncertainty of the model's\nprediction.

The properties of that interface and the structure of the\nelectronic wavefunctions that occupy it determine the functionality and the\ntopological nature of the superconducting state induced therein. Here we study\nthis buried interface by performing spectroscopic mappings of superconducting\naluminum islands epitaxially grown in-situ on indium arsenide nanowires. We\nfind unexpected robustness of the hybrid system as the direct contact with the\naluminum islands does not lead to any change in the chemical potential of the\nnanowires, nor does it induce a significant band bending in their vicinity. We\nattribute this to the presence of surface states bound to the facets of the\nnanowire. Such surface states, that are present also in bare nanowires prior to\naluminum deposition, pin the Fermi-level thus rendering the nanowires resilient\nto surface perturbations. The aluminum islands further display Coulomb blockade\ngaps and peaks that signify the formation of a resistive tunneling barrier at\nthe InAs-Al interface. At low energies we identify a potential energy barrier\nthat further suppresses the transmittance through the interface. A\ncorresponding barrier exists in bare semiconductors between surface states and\nthe accumulation layer, induced to maintain charge neutrality.

Although recent hand pose\nestimation methods using convolution neural network (CNN) have shown notable\nimprovements in accuracy, most of them have a limitation that they rely on a\ncomplex network structure without fully exploiting the articulated structure of\nthe hand. A hand, which is an articulated object, is composed of six local\nparts: the palm and five independent fingers.

In this paper, we propose a hierarchically-structured convolutional\nrecurrent neural network (HCRNN) with six branches that estimate the 3D\nposition of the palm and five fingers independently. The palm position is\npredicted via fully-connected layers. Each sequential-joint, i.e. finger\nposition, is obtained using a recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture the\nspatial dependencies between adjacent joints. Then the output features of the\npalm and finger branches are concatenated to estimate the global hand position.\nHCRNN directly takes the depth map as an input without a time-consuming data\nconversion, such as 3D voxels and point clouds. Experimental results on public\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed HCRNN not only outperforms most 2D\nCNN-based methods using the depth image as their inputs but also achieves\ncompetitive results with state-of-the-art 3D CNN-based methods with a highly\nefficient running speed of 285 fps on a single GPU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 04:38:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 04:36:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}

This\nis achieved by collecting linear, non-adaptive measurements of a signal, which\ncan be formalized as multiplying the signal with a \"measurement matrix\". If the\nmeasurement satisfies the so-called restricted isometry property (RIP), then it\nwill be appropriate to be used in compressed sensing. While a wide class of\nrandom matrices provably satisfy the RIP with high probability, explicit and\ndeterministic constructions have been shown (so far) to satisfy the RIP only in\na significantly suboptimal regime.\n  In this paper, we propose two novel approaches for improving the RIP constant\nestimates based on Gershgorin circle theorem for a specific deterministic\nconstruction based on Paley tight frames, obtaining an improvement over the\nGershgorin bound by a multiplicative constant. In one approach we use a recent\nresult on the spectra of the skew-adjacency matrices of oriented graphs. In the\nother approach, we use the so-called Dembo bounds on the extreme eigenvalues of\na positive semidefinite Hermitian matrix. We also generalize these bounds and\nwe combine the new bounds with a conjecture we make regarding the distribution\nof quadratic residues in a finite field to provide a potential path to break\nthe so-called \"square-root barrier\"-we provide a proof based on the assumption\nthat the conjecture holds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 04:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

However, few works take item\nhistory interactions into consideration, which leads to the insufficiency of\nitem feature representation and item attraction extraction. From these\nobservations, we model the user-item interaction as a dynamic interaction graph\n(DIG) and proposed a GNN-based model called Pairwise Interactive Graph\nAttention Network (PIGAT) to capture dynamic user interests and item\nattractions simultaneously. PIGAT introduces the attention mechanism to\nconsider the importance of each interacted user/item to both the user and the\nitem, which captures user interests, item attractions and their influence on\nthe recommendation context. Moreover, confidence embeddings are applied to\ninteractions to distinguish the confidence of interactions occurring at\ndifferent times.

First, we define a family of entanglement measures called\n\\textit{unextendible entanglement}.

A\nunified message passing algorithm that combines belief propagation (BP) and\nmean-field (MF) approximation is proposed for simplifying the intractable\ninference. By assuming conjugate-exponential priors for target kinematic state,\ntarget visibility state, and motion mode-model association, the MF\napproximation decouples the joint inference of target kinematic state, target\nvisibility state, motion mode-model association into individual low-dimensional\ninference, yielding simple message passing update equations. The BP is\nexploited to approximate the probabilities of data association events since it\nis compatible with hard constraints. Finally, the approximate posterior\nprobability distributions are updated iteratively in a closed-loop manner,\nwhich is effective for dealing with the coupling issue between the estimations\nof target kinematic state and target visibility state and decisions on motion\nmode-model association and data association.

In this paper, we consider deep transfer\nlearning as minimizing a linear combination of empirical loss and regularizer\nbased on pre-trained weights, where the regularizer would restrict the training\nprocedure from lowering the empirical loss, with conflicted descent directions\n(e.g., derivatives). Following the view, we propose a novel strategy making\nregularization-based Deep Transfer learning Never Hurt (DTNH) that, for each\niteration of training procedure, computes the derivatives of the two terms\nseparately, then re-estimates a new descent direction that does not hurt the\nempirical loss minimization while preserving the regularization affects from\nthe pre-trained weights.

Motivated by this, we consider long-term\naverage throughput maximization problems subject to average AoI and power\nconstraints in a single user fading channel, when (i) perfect and (ii) no\nchannel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is available. We propose\nsimple age-independent stationary randomized policies (AI-SRP), which allocate\npowers at the transmitter based only on the channel state and/or distribution\ninformation, without any knowledge of the AoI. We show that the optimal\nthroughputs achieved by the AI-SRPs for scenarios (i) and (ii) are at least\nequal to the half of the respective optimal long-term average throughputs,\nindependent of all the parameters of the problem, and that they are within\nadditive gaps, expressed in terms of the optimal dual variable corresponding to\ntheir average AoI constraints, from the respective optimal long-term average\nthroughputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 09:36:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

In this paper, we study the\ncomplexity of finding a choice reduction for the agent; that is, how to remove\nedges and vertices from the task graph such that a present-biased agent will\nremain motivated to reach his target even for a limited reward. While this\nproblem is NP-complete in general, this is not necessarily true for instances\nwhich occur in practice, or for solutions which are of interest to task\ndesigners. For instance, a task designer may desire to find the best task graph\nwhich is not too complicated.\n  We therefore investigate the problem of finding simple motivating subgraphs.\nThese are structures where the agent will modify his plan at most $k$ times\nalong the way. We quantify this simplicity in the time-inconsistency model as a\nstructural parameter: The number of branching vertices (vertices with\nout-degree at least $2$) in a minimal motivating subgraph.\n  Our results are as follows: We give a linear algorithm for finding an optimal\nmotivating path, i.e. when $k=0$. On the negative side, we show that finding a\nsimple motivating subgraph is NP-complete even if we allow only a single\nbranching vertex --- revealing that simple motivating subgraphs are indeed hard\nto find. However, we give a pseudo-polynomial algorithm for the case when $k$\nis fixed and edge weights are rationals, which might be a reasonable assumption\nin practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 10:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

LiuBei\nbuilds upon gradient aggregation rules (GARs) to tolerate a minority of\nByzantine workers. Besides, LiuBei replicates the parameter server on multiple\nmachines instead of trusting it. We introduce a novel filtering mechanism that\nenables workers to filter out replies from Byzantine server replicas without\nrequiring communication with all servers.

We therefore need to be able\nto use very much fainter reference objects. Laser guide stars in principle can\nallow 0.1 arcsecond resolution but have a number of severe technical problems\nthat limit their application. Our aims are to provide imaging at even higher\nresolution than Hubble. Lucky Imaging completely eliminates the tip-tilt errors\nin astronomical wavefront detection. Most of the power that remains is in low\norder, large scale structures. These may be detected with high sensitivity\nusing photon-counting EMCCD detectors working at high frame rate, up to ~100Hz.\nWith a new design of curvature wavefront sensor, wavefront errors may be\nmeasured and corrected to give near diffraction-limited performance on large\ngroundbased telescopes in the visible. Reference stars (and reference compact\ngalaxies) fainter than I~17.5 mag may be used routinely. This paper will\ndescribe how these work, what detector and other hardware is needed and what\nsoftware should be used to measure the wavefront errors and drive deformable\nmirror hardware. The software techniques that are used are those routinely\napplied for MRI and CT imaging.

Our work demonstrates that trapped excitons in perovskites prefer to\ninteract with transverse rather than longitudinal optical phonons. Since bulk\nmaterials usually interact with longitudinal optical phonons, this result\nprovides a physical explanation of the high tolerance of defects in\nperovskites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 11:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

Although there has been a\nlarge amount of work on monotone-constrained univariate curve estimation,\nmultivariate shape-constrained problems are much more challenging, and fewer\nadvances have been made in this direction. With a focus on monotone regression\nwith multiple predictors, this current work proposes a projection approach to\nestimate a multiple monotone regression function. An initial unconstrained\nestimator -- such as a local polynomial estimator or spline estimator -- is\nfirst obtained, which is then projected onto the shape-constrained space. A\nshape-constrained estimate (with multiple predictors) is obtained by\nsequentially projecting an (adjusted) initial estimator along each univariate\ndirection. Compared to the initial unconstrained estimator, the projection\nestimate results in a reduction of estimation error in terms of both $L^p$\n($p\\geq 1$) distance and supremum distance. We also derive the asymptotic\ndistribution of the projection estimate. Simple computational algorithms are\navailable for implementing the projection in both the unidimensional and higher\ndimensional cases.

FA treats different features and pixels\nunequally, which provides additional flexibility in dealing with different\ntypes of information, expanding the representational ability of CNNs. 2) A\nbasic block structure consists of Local Residual Learning and Feature\nAttention, Local Residual Learning allowing the less important information such\nas thin haze region or low-frequency to be bypassed through multiple local\nresidual connections, let main network architecture focus on more effective\ninformation. 3) An Attention-based different levels Feature Fusion (FFA)\nstructure, the feature weights are adaptively learned from the Feature\nAttention (FA) module, giving more weight to important features.

The multitask (MT)-sparse Bayesian\nlearning (SBL) is applied for learning time-varying sparse channels in the\nuplink for multi-user massive MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\nsystems. In particular, the dynamic information of the sparse channel is used\nto initialize the hyperparameters in the MT-SBL procedure for the next time\nstep. Then, the expectation maximization based updates are applied to estimate\nthe underlying parameters for different subcarriers. Through the simulation\nstudies, it is observed that using the dynamic information from the previous\ntime step considerably reduces the complexity and the required time for the\nconvergence of MT-SBL algorithm with negligible sacrificing of the estimation\naccuracy. Finally, the power leakage is reduced due to considering angular\nrefinement in the proposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 12:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

In\norder to achieve high model performance with the least number of samples,\nactive learning is a technique that queries the most important subset of data\nfrom the original dataset. In active learning domain, one of the mainstream\nresearch is the heuristic uncertainty-based method which is useful for the\nlearning-based system. Recently, a few works propose to apply policy\nreinforcement learning (PRL) for querying important data. It seems more general\nthan heuristic uncertainty-based method owing that PRL method depends on data\nfeature which is reliable than human prior. However, there have two problems -\nsample inefficiency of policy learning and overconfidence, when applying PRL on\nactive learning. To be more precise, sample inefficiency of policy learning\noccurs when sampling within a large action space, in the meanwhile, class\nimbalance can lead to the overconfidence. In this paper, we propose a\nbias-aware policy network called Heapified Active Learning (HAL), which\nprevents overconfidence, and improves sample efficiency of policy learning by\nheapified structure without ignoring global inforamtion(overview of the whole\nunlabeled set). In our experiment, HAL outperforms other baseline methods on\nMNIST dataset and duplicated MNIST. Last but not least, we investigate the\ngeneralization of the HAL policy learned on MNIST dataset by directly applying\nit on MNIST-M.

In particular, in the far-field case\n(acoustic sources many wavelengths away from a linear array of speakers) it is\npossible to quantize source angles slightly so that no processing per speaker\nis required beyond pure integer delay. Smoothly moving sources are obtained\nusing well known delay-line interpolation techniques such as linear\n(cross-fading) and Lagrange (polynomial) interpolation between/among speakers.\nWe call the far-field line-array case Planewave-Based Angle Panning (PBAP), in\nreference to the well-known Vector-Based Amplitude Panning (VBAP) family of\ntechniques, some of which are derived here as special cases: When speakers\nundersample the acoustic field, the result may be considered a form of VBAP,\nand VBAP is also obtained as a limiting case of polygonal PBAP arrays truncated\nto the polygon perimeter.

The toppling process is\nindependent of the actual number of grains $z_i$ of the toppling site, as long\nas $z_i\\ge2$. For a periodic lattice the model evolves into an inactive state\nfor small $p$, with the number of active sites becoming stationary for larger\nvalues of $p$. In one and two dimensions we find that the absorbing phase\ntransition occurs for $p_c\\!\\approx\\!0.717$ and $p_c\\!\\approx\\!0.275$.\n  The symmetry of bipartite lattices allows states in which all active sites\nare located alternatingly on one of the two sublattices, A and B, respectively\nfor even and odd times. We show that the AB-sublattice symmetry is\nspontaneously broken for the AAS model, an observation that holds also for the\nManna model. One finds that a metastable AB-symmetry conserving state is\ntransiently observable and that it has the potential to influence the width of\nthe scaling regime, in particular in two dimensions.\n  The AAS model mimics the behavior of integrate-and-fire neurons which\npropagate activity independently of the input received, as long as the\nthreshold is crossed. Abstracting from regular lattices, one can identify sites\nwith neurons and consider quenched networks of neurons connected to a fixed\nnumber $G$ of other neurons, with $G$ being drawn from a suitable distribution.\nThe neuronal activity is then propagated to $G$ other neurons. The AAS model is\nhence well suited for theoretical studies of nearly critical brain dynamics.

However, there areno\ntheoretical techniques that can analyze fully trained deep neural networks\nencountered inpractice.

This paper introduces domain generalization using a\nmixture of multiple latent domains as a novel and more realistic scenario,\nwhere we try to train a domain-generalized model without using domain labels.\nTo address this scenario, we propose a method that iteratively divides samples\ninto latent domains via clustering, and which trains the domain-invariant\nfeature extractor shared among the divided latent domains via adversarial\nlearning.

Thus, features are useful when the\napproximation error is small relative to the dimensionality of the features.\nThe idea is applied to stochastic bandits and reinforcement learning with a\ngenerative model where the learner has access to $d$-dimensional linear\nfeatures that approximate the action-value functions for all policies to an\naccuracy of $\\epsilon$. For linear bandits, we prove a bound on the regret of\norder $\\sqrt{dn \\log(k)} + \\epsilon n \\sqrt{d} \\log(n)$ with $k$ the number of\nactions and $n$ the horizon. For RL we show that approximate policy iteration\ncan learn a policy that is optimal up to an additive error of order $\\epsilon\n\\sqrt{d}/(1 - \\gamma)^2$ and using $d/(\\epsilon^2(1 - \\gamma)^4)$ samples from\na generative model. These bounds are independent of the finer details of the\nfeatures. We also investigate how the structure of the feature set impacts the\ntradeoff between sample complexity and estimation error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 14:55:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 15:36:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}

It can integrate graph node feature embedding,\nnode-wise affinity learning and matching optimization together in a unified\nend-to-end model. One important aspect of graph matching is the construction of\ntwo matching graphs. However, the matching graphs we feed to existing graph\nconvolutional matching networks are generally fixed and independent of graph\nmatching, which thus are not guaranteed to be optimal for the graph matching\ntask. Also, existing GCN matching method employs several general\nsmoothing-based graph convolutional layers to generate graph node embeddings,\nin which extensive smoothing convolution operation may dilute the desired\ndiscriminatory information of graph nodes. To overcome these issues, we propose\na novel Graph Learning-Matching Network (GLMNet) for graph matching problem.\nGLMNet has three main aspects. (1) It integrates graph learning into graph\nmatching which thus adaptively learn a pair of optimal graphs that best serve\ngraph matching task. (2) It further employs a Laplacian sharpening\nconvolutional module to generate more discriminative node embeddings for graph\nmatching. (3) A new constraint regularized loss is designed for GLMNet training\nwhich can encode the desired one-to-one matching constraints in matching\noptimization.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep multi-task\nadversarial learning method to localize facial landmark, estimate head pose and\nrecognize gender jointly or estimate multiple face attributes simultaneously\nthrough exploring their dependencies from both image representation-level and\nlabel-level. Specifically, the proposed method consists of a deep recognition\nnetwork R and a discriminator D. The deep recognition network is used to learn\nthe shared middle-level image representation and conducts multiple face\nanalysis tasks simultaneously. Through multi-task learning mechanism, the\nrecognition network explores the dependencies among multiple face analysis\ntasks, such as facial landmark localization, head pose estimation, gender\nrecognition and face attribute estimation from image representation-level. The\ndiscriminator is introduced to enforce the distribution of the multiple face\nanalysis tasks to converge to that inherent in the ground-truth labels. During\ntraining, the recognizer tries to confuse the discriminator, while the\ndiscriminator competes with the recognizer through distinguishing the predicted\nlabel combination from the ground-truth one. Though adversarial learning, we\nexplore the dependencies among multiple face analysis tasks from label-level.\nExperimental results on four benchmark databases, i.e., the AFLW database, the\nMulti-PIE database, the CelebA database and the LFWA database, demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method for multiple face analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 04:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

We begin by reviewing the\nstandard cosmological model and the tools used to understand it theoretically\nand to compute its observational consequences. This includes a detailed\nexposition of cosmological perturbation theory and the theory of inflation. We\nthen describe the results in this thesis, starting with the non-linear\nevolution of the curvature perturbation in the presence of vector and tensor\nfluctuations, in which we identify the version of that variable that is\nconserved in the most general situation. Next, we use second order perturbation\ntheory to describe the most general initial conditions for the evolution of\nscalar perturbations at second order in the standard cosmological model. We\ncompute approximate solutions valid in the initial stages of the evolution,\nwhich can be used to initialize second order Boltzmann codes, and to compute\nmany observables taking isocurvature modes into account. We then move on to the\nstudy of the inflationary Universe. We start by analysing a new way to compute\nthe consequences of a sudden transition in the evolution of a scalar during\ninflation. We use the formalism of quantum quenches to compute the effect of\nthose transitions on the spectral index of perturbations. Finally, we detail\nthe results of the exploration of a multi-field model of inflation with a\nnon-minimal coupling to gravity. We study popular attractor models in this\nregime in both the metric and the Palatini formulations of gravity and find all\nresults for both the power spectrum and bispectrum of fluctuations to closely\nresemble those of the single-field case. In all systems under study we discuss\nthe effects of non-linear dynamics and their importance for the resolution of\nproblems in cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 12:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

The \"coming to\nequilibrium\" distribution is established with MaxEnt by taking scale-freeness\nas prior hypothesis along with symmetry-conservation arguments.

The photoluminescence of individual Cr-doped QDs and their evolution in\nmagnetic field reveal a large magnetic anisotropy of the Cr spin induced by\nlocal strain. This results in a splitting of the Cr spin states and in a\nthermalization on the lower energy states states S$_z$=0 and S$_z$=$\\pm$1. The\nmagneto-optical properties of Cr-doped QDs can be modelled by an effective spin\nHamiltonian including the spin to strain coupling and the influence of the QD\nsymmetry. We also show that a single Cr spin can be prepared by resonant\noptical pumping. Monitoring the intensity of the resonant fluorescence of the\nQD during this process permits to probe the dynamics of the optical\ninitialization of the spin. Hole-Cr flip-flops induced by an interplay of the\nhole-Cr exchange interaction and the coupling with acoustic phonons are the\nmain source of relaxation that explains the efficient resonant optical pumping.\nThe Cr spin relaxation time is measured in the $\\mu s$ range. We evidence that\na Cr spin couples to non-equilibrium acoustic phonons generated during the\noptical excitation inside or near the QD). Finally we show that the energy of\nany spin state of an individual Cr atom can be independently tuned by a\nresonant single mode laser through the optical Stark effect. All these\nproperties make Cr-doped QDs very promising for the development of hybrid\nspin-mechanical systems where a coherent mechanical driving of an individual\nspin in an oscillator is required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 14:41:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

To improve traditional sparse representation based image compressive\nsensing (CS) performance, we propose a generalized CS framework based on GSR\nmodel, which leads to a nonconvex nonsmooth low-rank minimization problem. The\npopular L_2-norm and M-estimator are employed for standard image CS and robust\nCS problem to fit the data respectively.

The first filter injects a compressed stream\nof electrons from the hot contact, at an effective temperature much lower than\nthe channel temperature. The compressed stream of injected electrons, then,\nabsorb energy via inelastic scattering inside the channel and are finally\nextracted via a second filter at the cold contact interface.
