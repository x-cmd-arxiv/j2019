To close this gap, we propose a spherical\ngenerative model based on which unsupervised word and paragraph embeddings are\njointly learned.

A hardening of the spectrum around an energy of order few\nhundred~GeV, first observed by the magnetic spectrometers PAMELA and AMS02, has\nnow been confirmed by several calorimeter detectors (ATIC, CREAM, CALET,\nNUCLEON and DAMPE). These new measurements reach higher energy and indicate\nthat the hardening corresponds to a larger step in spectral index than what\nestimated by the magnetic spectrometers. Data at still higher energy (by CREAM,\nNUCLEON and DAMPE) show that the proton spectrum undergoes a marked softening\nat $E \\approx 10^4$~GeV. Understanding the origin of these unexpected spectral\nfeatures is a significant challenge for models of the Galactic cosmic rays. An\nimportant open question is whether additional features are present in the\nproton spectrum between the softening and the \"Knee\". Extensive Air Shower\ndetectors, using unfolding procedures that require the modeling of cosmic ray\nshowers in the atmosphere, estimated the proton flux below and around the Knee\n(at $E \\simeq 3$~PeV). These results however have large systematic\nuncertainties and are in poor agreement with each other. The measurement in the\nPeV energy range, recently presented by IceTop/IceCube, indicates a proton flux\nhigher than extrapolations of the direct measurements calculated assuming a\nconstant slope, and therefore requires the existence of an additional spectral\nhardening below the Knee. A clarification of this point is very important for\nan understanding of the origin of the Galactic cosmic rays, and is also\nessential for a precise calculation of the spectra of atmospheric neutrinos in\nthe energy range ($E \\gtrsim 10$~TeV) where they constitute the foreground for\nthe emerging astrophysical $\\nu$ signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 16:25:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

The path loss at these frequencies naturally leads us to consider\nantenna arrays with many elements. In these arrays, local oscillator (LO)\ngeneration is particularly challenging since the LO specifications affect the\nsystem architecture, signal processing design, and circuit implementation. We\nthoroughly analyze the effect of LO architecture design choices on the\nperformance of a mm-wave massive MIMO uplink. This investigation focuses on the\ntradeoffs involved in centralized and distributed LO generation, correlated and\nuncorrelated phase noise sources, and the bandwidths of PLLs and carrier\nrecovery loops. We show that, from both a performance and implementation\ncomplexity standpoint, the optimal LO architecture uses several distributed\nsubarrays locked to a single intermediate-frequency reference in the low GHz\nrange. Additionally, we show that the choice of PLL and carrier recovery loop\nbandwidths strongly affects the performance; for typical system parameters,\nloop bandwidths on the order of tens of MHz achieve SINRs suitable for\nhigh-order constellations. Finally, we present system simulations incorporating\na complete model of the LO generation system and consider the case of a\n128-element array with 16x-spatial multiplexing and a 2 GHz channel bandwidth\nat 75 GHz carrier. Using our optimization procedure we show that the system can\nsupport 16-way spatial multiplexing with 64-QAM modulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 17:01:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

It is more realistic but also brings a larger volume of data\nthat needs to be compressed efficiently. The state-of-the-art method to\ncompress the plenoptic point cloud is an extension of the region-based adaptive\nhierarchical transform (RAHT). As far as we can see, in addition to RAHT, the\nvideo-based point cloud compression (V-PCC) is also an efficient point cloud\ncompression method. However, to the best of our knowledge, no works have used a\nvideo-based solution to compress the plenoptic point cloud yet. In this paper,\nwe first extend the V-PCC to support the plenoptic point cloud compression by\ngenerating multiple attribute videos. Then based on the observation that these\nvideos from multiple views have very high correlations, we propose encoding\nthem using multiview high efficiency video coding. We further propose a\nblock-based padding method that unifies the unoccupied attribute pixels from\ndifferent views to reduce their bit cost. The proposed algorithms are\nimplemented in the V-PCC reference software. The experimental results show that\nthe proposed algorithms can bring significant bitrate savings compared with the\nstate-of-the-art method for plenoptic point cloud compression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 17:36:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

However, prior works\neither grade DR or DME, and ignore the correlation between DR and its\ncomplication, i.e., DME. Moreover, the location information, e.g., macula and\nsoft hard exhaust annotations, are widely used as a prior for grading.

The proposed Fibonacci fibers are simple and\nstraightforward to fabricate and have a rich set of properties that are of\npotential use for quantum applications. Our simulation and experimental results\nshow that, in contrast with randomly disordered structures, localized quantum\nwalks in new proposed quasiperiodic photonics lattices are highly controllable\ndue to the deterministic disordered nature of quasiperiodic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 18:19:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

In particular, many studies adopt\nthe locally isothermal approximation, in which the disk temperature is a fixed\nfunction of the stellocentric distance. We explore the dynamics of\nplanet-driven density waves in disks with more general thermodynamics, in which\nthe temperature is relaxed towards an equilibrium profile on a finite cooling\ntimescale $t_{\\rm c}$. We use both linear perturbation theory and direct\nnumerical simulations to examine the global structure of density waves launched\nby planets in such disks. A key diagnostic used in this study is the behavior\nof the wave angular momentum flux (AMF), which directly determines the\nevolution of the underlying disk. The AMF of free waves is constant for slowly\ncooling (adiabatic) disks, but scales with the disk temperature for rapidly\ncooling (and locally isothermal) disks.

Inclusive measurements of\nbreakup--also called knockout reactions--have even higher statistics. In this\nproceeding, we study which nuclear-structure information can be inferred from\nthe parallel-momentum distribution of the core of one-neutron halo nuclei after\nthe knockout of its halo neutron. In particular, we analyse the influence of\nthe ground-state wavefunction, the presence of excited states within the\nhalo-nucleus spectrum and resonances in the core-neutron continuum. Our\nanalysis shows that such observables are sensitive to the tail of the\nground-state wavefunction. The presence of excited state decreases the breakup\nstrength, and this flux is transferred to the inelastic-scattering channel.\nThis indicates a conservation of the flux within each partial wave. We also\nshow that the parallel-momentum distributions are insensitive to the existence\nof resonances within the continuum, they can thus be ignored in practice. This\nindependence on the continuum argues that the parallel-momentum distributions\nare ideal observables to extract very precisely the ANCs of halo nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 21:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

To\ncounteract the changing dynamics, we propose to adapt the parameters of\nexisting controllers to the changing conditions. Doing so, however, is\nchallenging, as large power systems often involve multiple subsystem operators,\nwhich, for safety and privacy reasons, do not want to exchange detailed\ninformation about their subsystems. Furthermore, centralized tuning of\nstructured controllers for large-scale systems, such as power networks, is\noften computationally very challenging. For this reason, we present a\nhierarchical decentralized approach for controller tuning, which increases data\nsecurity and scalability. The proposed method is based on the exchange of\nstructured reduced models of subsystems, which conserves data privacy and\nreduces computational complexity. For this purpose, suitable methods for model\nreduction and model matching are introduced. Furthermore, we demonstrate how\nincreased renewable penetration leads to time-varying dynamics on the IEEE 68\nbus power system, which underlines the importance of the problem.

Taken\nliterally, it refers to a type of dense accumulation of wood in rivers widely\nrecognized as bestowing numerous biological and physical benefits to the system\nbut also present serious hazards to infrastructure. Despite this, no in-situ\nfield measurements have assessed the degree of arrest in a naturally-formed\nlogjam. Using time-lapse photography, repeat total station surveys and water\nlevel loggers, we provide an unprecedented perspective on the evolution of a\nlogjam in central Idaho. Despite the namesake, we find that the logjam is not\njammed. The ensemble of logs progressively deforms in response to shear and\nbuoyant lift of flowing water, modulated by the rising limb, peak and falling\nlimb of the snowmelt hydrograph. As water rises and log drag against the bed\nand banks decreases, they collectively translate downstream, generating a\nheterogeneous pattern of deformation. As streamflow recedes and the logs\nreconnect with the bed and banks, the coherent deformation pattern degrades as\nlogs settle opportunistically amongst their neighbors. Field observations of\ncontinuous movement at a low rate are qualitatively similar to creep and\nclogging, behaviors that are common to a wide class of disordered materials.\nThese similarities open the possibility to inform future studies of\nenvironmental clogging, wood-laden flows, logjams, hazard mitigation and the\ndesign of engineered logjams by bridging these practices with frontier research\nefforts in soft matter physics and granular rheology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 22:28:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

On the other hand, the amplitude and strength of the\nspirals decrease when the cooling time increases from a small value to $\\sim\n1/\\Omega$, but then the amplitude starts to increase again when the cooling\ntime continues to increase. This indicates that radiative dissipation becomes\nimportant for waves with $T_{cool}\\sim$ 1. Consequently, the induced primary\ngap is narrower and the secondary gap becomes significantly shallower when the\ncooling time becomes $\\sim 1/\\Omega$. When the secondary gap is present, the\nposition of it moves to the inner disk from the fast cooling cases to the slow\ncooling cases. The dependence of gap properties on the cooling timescale (e.g.\nin AS 209) provides a new way to constrain the disk optical depth and thus disk\nsurface density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 23:18:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 20:47:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-14"}

In this paper,\nbased on the iterative clipping and filtering (ICF) and optimization methods,\nwe investigate the PAPR reduction in the mixed-numerology systems. We first\nillustrate that the direct extension of classical ICF brings about the\naccumulation of inter-numerology interference (INI) due to the repeated\nexecution. By exploiting the clipping noise rather than the clipped signal, the\nnoise-shaped ICF (NS-ICF) method is then proposed without increasing the INI.\nNext, we address the in-band distortion minimization problem subject to the\nPAPR constraint. By reformulation, the resulting model is separable in both the\nobjective function and the constraints, and well suited for the alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM) approach. The ADMM-based algorithms are\nthen developed to split the original problem into several subproblems which can\nbe easily solved with closed-form solutions.

In\naddition, DFT-based linear-response theory has been utilized to predict\nWarren-Cowley short-range order (SRO) in these alloys, which reveals\npotentially competing long-range ordered phases. The resulting SRO is uniquely\nanalyzed using concentration-waves analysis for occupation probabilities in\npartially-ordered states, which is then be assessed for phase stability by\ndirect DFT calculations. Our results are in good agreement with experiments and\nCALPHAD in Al-poor regions ($x \\le 0.75$) and with CALPHAD in Al-rich region\n($0.75 \\le {x} \\le 1$), and they suggest more careful experiments in Al-rich\nregion are needed.

AReN takes as input an LTI system with quadratic\ncost specification, and outputs a ReLU NN architecture with the assurance that\nthere exist network weights that exactly implement the associated MPC\ncontroller. AReN thus offers new insight into the design of ReLU NN\narchitectures for the control of LTI systems: instead of training a\nheuristically chosen NN architecture on data -- or iterating over many\narchitectures until a suitable one is found -- AReN can suggest an adequate NN\narchitecture before training begins.

AReN\nachieves this using two novel features. First, we reinterpret a recent result\nabout the implementation of CPWL functions via ReLU NNs to show that a CPWL\nfunction may be implemented by a ReLU architecture that is determined by the\nnumber of distinct affine regions in the function. Second, we show that we can\nefficiently over-approximate the number of affine regions in the optimal MPC\ncontroller without solving the MPC problem exactly. Together, these results\nconnect the MPC problem to a ReLU NN implementation without explicitly solving\nthe MPC and directly translates this feature to a ReLU NN architecture that\ncomes with the assurance that it can implement the MPC controller. We show\nthrough numerical results the effectiveness of AReN in designing an NN\narchitecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 04:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

Although this postulation is unrealistic in the\nstrict sense, how the result is affected by this approximation is still\nunclear.

For this comparison purpose, a\nlarge grid of standard rotational broadening functions and their\ntransforms/zeros were also calculated. It turned out that the situation\ncriticaly depends on vsini: In case of vsini>~20km/s where rotational\nbroadening is predominant over other line broadening velocities (typically\nseveral km/s), the 1st/2nd zeros of the transform are confirmed almost at the\nexpected positions. In contrast, deviations begin to appear as vsini is\nlowered, and the zero features of the transform are totally different from the\nexpectation at vsini as low as ~10km/s, which means that the classical\nformulation is no more valid.

The coupling is treated at the adiabatic level of\nthe medium's response, which mediates a first-order in frequency dissipative\ninteraction along with an instantaneous Heisenberg exchange. The resultant\ndamped spin precession yields exceptional points (EPs) in the coupled spin\ndynamics, which should be experimentally accessible with the existing magnetic\nheterostructures. In particular, we show that an EP is naturally approached in\nan antiferromagnetic dimer by controlling local damping, while the same is\nachieved by tuning the dissipative coupling between spins in the ferromagnetic\ncase. Extending our treatment to one-dimensional spin chains, we show how EPs\ncan emerge within the magnonic Brillouin zone by tuning the dissipative\nproperties. The critical point, at which an EP pair emerges out of the\nBrillouin zone center, realizes a gapless Weyl point in the magnon spectrum.\nTuning damping beyond this critical point produces synchronization (level\nattraction) of magnon modes over a finite range of momenta, both in ferro- and\nantiferromagnetic cases. We thus establish that damped magnons can generically\nyield singular points in their band structure, close to which their kinematic\nproperties, such as group velocity, become extremely sensitive to the control\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 05:02:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2019 23:45:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

It is common to have outliers in industry\napplications, which could be generated by different causes such as human error,\nfraudulent activities, or system failure. Recently, density-based methods have\nshown promising results, particularly among which Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is\narguably dominating. However, one of the major drawbacks of LOF is that it is\ncomputationally expensive. Motivated by the mentioned problem, this research\npresents a novel pruning-based procedure in which the execution time of LOF is\nreduced while the performance is maintained. A novel Prune-based Local Outlier\nFactor (PLOF) approach is proposed, in which prior to employing LOF,\noutlierness of each data instance is measured.

While highly relevant from a research perspective, these\ntechniques are of limited practical use when the underlying object or data\nstructure is sizable. The copy operation can consume much of the CPU's\nresources and significantly degrade performance.\n  To overcome this limitation, we have designed CX, a multi-instance-based\nwait-free universal construct that substantially reduces the amount of copy\noperations.

This task can be formalized either as a sentence\nclassification task (i.e., containing term-definition pairs or not) or a\nsequential labeling task (i.e., identifying the boundaries of the terms and\ndefinitions). The previous works for DE have only focused on one of the two\napproaches, failing to model the inter-dependencies between the two tasks.

Our model\nfeatures deep learning architectures to exploit the global structures of the\ninput sentences as well as the semantic consistencies between the terms and the\ndefinitions, thereby improving the quality of the representation vectors for\nDE. Besides the joint inference between sentence classification and sequential\nlabeling, the proposed model is fundamentally different from the prior work for\nDE in that the prior work has only employed the local structures of the input\nsentences (i.e., word-to-word relations), and not yet considered the semantic\nconsistencies between terms and definitions. In order to implement these novel\nideas, our model presents a multi-task learning framework that employs graph\nconvolutional neural networks and predicts the dependency paths between the\nterms and the definitions. We also seek to enforce the consistency between the\nrepresentations of the terms and definitions both globally (i.e., increasing\nsemantic consistency between the representations of the entire sentences and\nthe terms/definitions) and locally (i.e., promoting the similarity between the\nrepresentations of the terms and the definitions).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 09:23:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 20:28:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2019 23:54:37 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 19:24:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-01"}

We\nimpute this difference to the different amount of coherence generated by the\nevolution and, in turn, to the fact that, in 2D, the square and the triangular\nlattices are Bravais lattices, whereas the honeycomb one is non-Bravais.

They minimize\nthe magnetic energy dissipation or, equivalently, maximize the growth rate at a\nfixed magnetic Reynolds number. In the optimal dynamo of Willis (2012, Phys.\nRev. Lett. 109, 251101), we find mean-field dynamo action for planar averages.\nOne component of the magnetic field grows exponentially while the other decays\nin an oscillatory fashion near onset. This behavior is different from that of\nan alpha^2 dynamo, where the two non-vanishing components of the planar\naverages are coupled and have the same growth rate. For the Willis dynamo, we\nfind that the mean field is excited by a negative turbulent magnetic\ndiffusivity, which has a non-uniform spatial profile near onset. The temporal\noscillations in the decaying component are caused by the corresponding\ncomponent of the diffusivity tensor being complex when the mean field is\ndecaying and, in this way, time-dependent. The growing mean field can be\nmodeled by a negative magnetic diffusivity combined with a positive magnetic\nhyperdiffusivity. In two other classes of optimal dynamos of Chen et al. (2015,\nJ. Fluid Mech. 783, 23), we find, to some extent, similar mean-field dynamo\nactions. When the magnetic boundary conditions are mixed, the two components of\nthe planar averaged field grow at different rates when the dynamo is 15%\nsupercritical. When the mean magnetic field satisfies homogeneous boundary\nconditions (where the magnetic field is tangential to the boundary), mean-field\ndynamo action is found for one-dimensional averages, but not for planar\naverages. Despite having different spatial profiles, both dynamos show negative\nturbulent magnetic diffusivities. Our finding suggests negative turbulent\nmagnetic diffusivities may support a broader class of dynamos than previously\nthought, including these three optimal dynamos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 11:06:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 2019 15:34:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

Our approach is based on background subtraction as an efficient and\nunsupervised method that is able to output the shape of objects. In order to\nreliably detect low contrast and small objects, we configure the background\nsubtraction to extract foreground regions that might be objects of interest.\nWhile this dramatically increases the number of false alarms, a Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) considering both spatial and temporal information is then\ntrained to reject the false alarms. In areas with heavy traffic, the background\nsubtraction yields merged detections. To reduce the complexity of multi-target\ntracker needed, we train another CNN to predict the positions of multiple\nmoving objects in an area.

This formulation comes with the following\nkey advantages: (1) The span prediction strategy provides the flexibility of\nretrieving mentions left out at the mention proposal stage; (2) In the MRC\nframework, encoding the mention and its context explicitly in a query makes it\npossible to have a deep and thorough examination of cues embedded in the\ncontext of coreferent mentions; and (3) A plethora of existing MRC datasets can\nbe used for data augmentation to improve the model's generalization capability.\nExperiments demonstrate significant performance boost over previous models,\nwith 87.5 (+2.5) F1 score on the GAP benchmark and 83.1 (+3.5) F1 score on the\nCoNLL-2012 benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 12:44:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2020 07:15:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 04:19:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2020 05:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

If an insufficiently refined non-rotationally invariant angular\ndiscretisation is used, there are areas of the problem where no particles will\npropogate. These \"ray-effects\" are problematic for goal-based error metrics\nwith angular adaptivty, as the metrics in the pre-asymptotic region will be\nzero/incorrect and angular adaptivity will not occur. In this work we use\nlow-order filtered spherical harmonics, which is rotationally invariant and\nhence not subject to ray-effects, to \"bootstrap\" our error metric and enable\nhighly refined anisotropic angular adaptivity with a Haar wavelet angular\ndiscretisation. We test this on three simple problems with pure streaming where\nwe know a priori where refinement should occur.

As the\ndesign of control strategies is often based on an assessment of the distance\nover which transmission can realistically occur and estimation of this distance\nis very sensitive to the choice of kernel function, it is important that models\nused to inform control strategies can be scrutinised in the light of\nobservation in order to elicit possible evidence against the selected kernel\nfunction. While a range of approaches to model criticism are in existence, the\nfield remains one in which the need for further research is recognised. In this\npaper, building on earlier contributions by the authors, we introduce a new\napproach to assessing the validity of spatial kernels - the latent likelihood\nratio tests - and compare its capacity to detect model misspecification with\nthat of tests based on the use of infection-link residuals. We demonstrate that\nthe new approach, which combines Bayesian and frequentist ideas by treating the\nstatistical decision maker as a complex entity, can be used to formulate tests\nwith greater power than infection-link residuals to detect kernel\nmisspecification particularly when the degree of misspecification is modest.\nThis new approach avoids the use of a fully Bayesian approach which may\nintroduce undesirable complications related to computational complexity and\nprior sensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 14:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

The GEM consists of a polyimide foil which is coated by two thin\ncopper layers.

The effect is commonly\nknown as the charging-up effect.\n  This work presents a systematic investigation of the effect under\nwell-controlled and monitored conditions for a single standard GEM foil in\nAr/CO$_2$ (90/10) gas for varying rates of X-ray interactions in the detector\nand for different gains of the foil. In order to cover a wide range of\ndifferent rates, we apply two different methods. The first one is based on a\ncurrent measurement while the second one relies on the analysis of $^{55}$Fe\nspectra over time. Both methods give consistent results, showing an initial\nincrease of the effective gain with time and an asymptotic saturation, which\ncan be well described by a single-exponential function. We find that the\ncharacteristic time constants extracted from our measurements scale inversely\nproportional to the rate of incoming electrons for a given GEM voltage.\nIntroducing characteristic quantities, which describe either the number of\nincoming electrons per hole or the total number of electrons in a hole per\ncharacteristic time, we find consistent numbers for measurements taken at the\nsame GEM voltages.

Two\npotentials characterize the interparticle interactions in the system. The\nlong-ranged attraction between the fluid particles is described by a potential\n$w(r)$, and $v(r)$ characterizes the substrate-fluid interaction. By\nintegrating out the elastic degrees of freedom we obtain an effective theory\nfor the fluid number density alone. Its structure is similar to the one for\nwetting of an inert substrate.

Accordingly, the model is trained through two steps: \"starting\nfrom scratch\" and \"checking for gaps\". The former uses all the samples to\noptimize the model, while the latter only trains for samples with poor control.\nExperimental results on the popular datasets MSVD and MSR-VTT demonstrate that\nour non-ensemble model outperforms the state-of-the-art video captioning\nbenchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 15:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

We here investigate their fate if residual\ninteractions beyond BCS theory are included. For a minimal square-lattice model\nwith a plaquette interaction, we find string-like integrals of motion that form\nClifford algebras and lead to exact degeneracies. These degeneracies strongly\ndepend on whether the numbers of sites in the $x$ and $y$ directions are even\nor odd, and are robust against disorder in the interactions. We show that the\nmapping of the Majorana model onto two decoupled spin compass models [Kamiya et\nal., Phys. Rev.

The mapping shows that the three-leg\nand four-leg Majorana ladders are integrable, while systems of larger width are\nnot. In addition, the mapping maximally reduces the effort for exact\ndiagonalization, which is utilized to obtain the gap above the ground states.\nWe find that this gap remains open if one dimension is kept constant and even,\nwhile the other is sent to infinity, at least if that dimension is odd.\nMoreover, we compare the topological properties of the interacting Majorana\nmodel to those of the toric-code model. The Majorana model has long-range\nentangled ground states that differ by $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes through the system\non a torus. The ground states exhibit string condensation similar to the toric\ncode but the topological order is not robust.

However,\nAVs' benefits also introduce a serious potential challenge, in the form of\ncomplex interactions with human-driven vehicles (HVs). The emergence of AVs\nintroduces uncertainty in the behavior of human actors and in the impact of the\nAV manufacturer on autonomous driving design. This paper thus aims to\ninvestigate how AVs affect road safety and to design socially optimal liability\nrules for AVs and human drivers. A unified game is developed, including a Nash\ngame between human drivers, a Stackelberg game between the AV manufacturer and\nHVs, and a Stackelberg game between the law maker and other users. We also\nestablish the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium of the game. The game\nis then simulated with numerical examples to investigate the emergence of human\ndrivers' moral hazard, the AV manufacturer's role in traffic safety, and the\nlaw maker's role in liability design. Our findings demonstrate that human\ndrivers could develop moral hazard if they perceive their road environment has\nbecome safer and an optimal liability rule design is crucial to improve social\nwelfare with advanced transportation technologies. More generally, the\ngame-theoretic model developed in this paper provides an analytical tool to\nassist policy-makers in AV policymaking and hopefully mitigate uncertainty in\nthe existing regulation landscape about AV technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 03:06:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 02:26:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 17:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

But learning how to distinguish the security bug\nreports from other bug reports is challenging since they may occur rarely. Data\nmining methods that can find such scarce targets require extensive optimization\neffort.\n  Goal: The goal of this research is to aid practitioners as they struggle to\noptimize methods that try to distinguish between rare security bug reports and\nother bug reports.\n  Method: Our proposed method, called Swift, is a dual optimizer that optimizes\nboth learner and pre-processor options. Since this is a large space of options,\nSwift uses a technique called epsilon-dominance that learns how to avoid\noperations that do not significantly improve performance.\n  Result: When compared to recent state-of-the-art results (from FARSEC which\nis published in TSE'18), we find that the Swift's dual optimization of both\npre-processor and learner is more useful than optimizing each of them\nindividually. For example, in a study of security bug reports from the Chromium\ndataset, the median recalls of FARSEC and Swift were 15.7% and 77.4%,\nrespectively. For another example, in experiments with data from the Ambari\nproject, the median recalls improved from 21.5% to 85.7% (FARSEC to SWIFT).\n  Conclusion: Overall, our approach can quickly optimize models that achieve\nbetter recalls than the prior state-of-the-art. These increases in recall are\nassociated with moderate increases in false positive rates (from 8% to 24%,\nmedian). For future work, these results suggest that dual optimization is both\npractical and useful.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 19:30:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 02:21:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 01:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-19"}

To our knowledge, this\nis the first time opto-mechanical damping has been observed in the AFM. We\nhypothesize that this damping force is a consequence of the dissipative\ninteraction between the sample and the vibrating tip; the modulated light\nsource in PiFM modulates the effective damping constant of the 2nd eigenmode of\nthe cantilever which in turn generate side-band signals producing the PiFM\nsignal at the 1st eigenmode. A series of experiments have eliminated other\nmechanisms of contrast. By tracking the frequency shift of the PiFM signal at\nthe 1st cantilever eigenmode as the excitation wavenumber is tuned through a\nmid-infrared absorption band, we showed that the near-field optical interaction\nis attractive. By using a vibrating piezoelectric crystal to mimic sample\nthermal expansion in a PiFM operating in mixing mode, we determined that the\nminimum thermal expansion our system can detect is 30 pm limited by system\nnoise. We have confirmed that van der Waal mediated thermal-expansion forces\nhave negligible effect on PiFM signals by detecting the resonant response of a\n4-methylbenzenethiol mono molecular layer deposited on template-stripped gold,\nwhere thermal expansion was expected to be < 3 pm, i.e., 10 times lower than\nour system noise level.

We believe the NAIRDSP should be\nextended in light of the rapid pace of development and innovation in the field\nof Artificial Intelligence (AI) since 2016, and present our recommendations\nbelow. AI has profoundly impacted many areas of human life, promising to\ndramatically reshape society --- e.g., economy, education, science --- in the\ncoming years. We are still early in this process. It is critical to invest now\nin this technology to ensure it is safe and deployed ethically. Science and\nsociety both have a strong need for accuracy, efficiency, transparency, and\naccountability in algorithms, making investments in scientific AI particularly\nvaluable. Thus far the US has been a leader in AI technologies, and we believe\nas a national Laboratory it is crucial to help maintain and extend this\nleadership. Moreover, investments in AI will be important for maintaining US\nleadership in the physical sciences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 04:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}

This article reports on the theoretical quantization of this\nterm based on spontaneous symmetry breaking in the spatial geometry of a gauge\ngroup (G-group) of quantum charged (QC) particles. A locally supersymmetric\nbackground-independent spatial geometry of the G-group is developed based on\nthe commutative string field interaction (SFI) between infinite number of QC\nparticles and the grand monopole and the noncommutative SFI of each pair of\nadjacent QC particles in the G-group. Two adjoint and disjoint currents are\nassociated with the commutative and noncommutative SFIs, respectively, based on\nthe spin of a QC particle. The adjoint and disjoint currents are associated\nwith a zero resistivity between a QC particle and the grand monopole and an\ninfinite resistivity between each pair of adjacent QC particles correlated to\ntheir microscopic commutative and noncommutative SFIs in the G-group,\nrespectively. This article demonstrates that the two corresponding\nresistivities are finite (greater than zero and less than infinity) for the\nmacroscopic commutative and noncommutative SFIs of the G-group. Therefore, the\nadjoint and disjoint currents are related to the classical macroscopic currents\nknown as electric and magnetic currents, respectively. Because the microscopic\nadjoint current associated with the commutative SFI has already been related to\nthe macroscopic electric current density in the Maxwell equations, it is\nproposed that the microscopic disjoint current associated with the\nnoncommutative SFI is related to the undefined magnetic current density in\nthese equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 23:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

More precisely, the claim is that whenever it appears that a magnetic\nforce is doing work, the work is actually being done by another force, with the\nmagnetic force serving only as an indirect mediator. On the other hand, the\nmost familiar instances of magnetic forces acting in everyday life - bar\nmagnets lifting other bar magnets - appear to present manifest evidence of\nmagnetic forces doing work. These sorts of counterexamples are often dismissed\nas arising from quantum effects that lie outside the classical regime. In this\npaper, however, we show that quantum theory is not needed to account for these\nphenomena, and that classical electromagnetism admits a model of elementary\nmagnetic dipoles on which magnetic forces can indeed do work. In order to\ndevelop this model, we revisit the foundational principles of the classical\ntheory of electromagnetism, showcase the importance of constraints from\nrelativity, examine the structure of the multipole expansion, and study the\nconnection between the Lorentz force law and conservation of energy and\nmomentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 23:41:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}
