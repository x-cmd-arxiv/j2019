Current pCLE\nreconstruction is based on interpolating irregular signals onto an over-sampled\nCartesian grid, using a naive linear interpolation. It was shown that\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) could improve pCLE image quality. Although\nclassical CNNs were applied to pCLE, input data were limited to reconstructed\nimages in contrast to irregular data produced by pCLE. Methods: We compare pCLE\nreconstruction and super-resolution (SR) methods taking irregularly sampled or\nreconstructed pCLE images as input. We also propose to embed a Nadaraya-Watson\n(NW) kernel regression into the CNN framework as a novel trainable CNN layer.\nUsing the NW layer and exemplar-based super-resolution, we design an NWNetSR\narchitecture that allows for reconstructing high-quality pCLE images directly\nfrom the irregularly sampled input data.

The\nfirst monolayer retains its hexagonal structure and acts as a template into\nwhich the particles of the second monolayer rearrange to occupy interstitial\npositions. The frustration between the two lattices generates new symmetries.\nBy simply varying the packing fraction of the two monolayers, we obtain not\nonly low-coordination structures such as rectangular and honeycomb lattices,\nbut also rhomboidal, hexagonal, and herringbone superlattices which display\nnon-regular tessellations. Molecular dynamics simulations show that these\nstructures are thermodynamically stable and develop from short-ranged repulsive\ninteractions, making them easy to predict, and thus opening new avenues to the\nrational design of complex patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 16:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-12"}

Normalizing\nweights or activations allows the use of higher learning rates, resulting in\nfaster convergence and higher test accuracy. Batch normalization requires\nminibatch statistics that approximate the dataset statistics but this incurs\nadditional compute and memory costs and causes a communication bottleneck for\ndistributed training. Weight normalization and initialization-only schemes do\nnot achieve comparable test accuracy.\n  We introduce a new understanding of the cause of training instability and\nprovide a technique that is independent of normalization and minibatch\nstatistics. Our approach treats training instability as a spatial common mode\nsignal which is suppressed by placing the model on a channel-wise zero-mean\nisocline that is maintained throughout training. Firstly, we apply channel-wise\nzero-mean initialization of filter kernels with overall unity kernel magnitude.\nAt each training step we modify the gradients of spatial kernels so that their\nweighted channel-wise mean is subtracted in order to maintain the common mode\nrejection condition. This prevents the onset of mean shift. This new technique\nallows direct training of the test graph so that training and test models are\nidentical. We also demonstrate that injecting random noise throughout the\nnetwork during training improves generalization. This is based on the idea\nthat, as a side effect, batch normalization performs deep data augmentation by\ninjecting minibatch noise due to the weakness of the dataset approximation.\n  Our technique achieves higher accuracy compared to batch normalization and\nfor the first time shows that minibatches and normalization are unnecessary for\nstate-of-the-art training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 16:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-02"}

Interesting applications\nusually involve non-smooth terms which require well-designed optimization\nalgorithms for their resolution. The present manuscript presents the Python\npackage called fenics_optim built on top of the FEniCS finite element software\nwhich enables to automate the formulation and resolution of various convex\nvariational problems. Formulating such a problem relies on FEniCS\ndomain-specific language and the representation of convex functions, in\nparticular non-smooth ones, in the conic programming framework. The discrete\nformulation of the corresponding optimization problems hinges on the finite\nelement discretization capabilities offered by FEniCS while their numerical\nresolution is carried out by the interior-point solver Mosek. Through various\nillustrative examples, we show that convex optimization problems can be\nformulated using only a few lines of code, discretized in a very simple manner\nand solved extremely efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 16:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-02"}

This approach relies critically on an embedding principle, which\nconsists in representing discretely sampled data as paths, i.e., functions from\n$[0,1]$ to $\\mathbb{R}^d$. After a survey of machine learning methodologies for\nsignatures, the influence of embeddings on prediction accuracy is investigated\nwith an in-depth study of three recent and challenging datasets. It is shown\nthat a specific embedding, called lead-lag, is systematically the strongest\nperformer across all datasets and algorithms considered. Moreover, an empirical\nstudy reveals that computing signatures over the whole path domain does not\nlead to a loss of local information. It is concluded that, with a good\nembedding, combining signatures with other simple algorithms achieves results\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art, domain-specific approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 17:16:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 16:13:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 11:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

We call these objects $N$-MACHOs. In\nsuch theories neither the existence of dark matter species nor their extremely\nweak coupling to the observable sector represent additional hypotheses but\ninstead are imposed by the solution to the Hierarchy Problem and unitarity. The\ncrucial point is that particles from the same sector have non-trivial\ninteractions but interact only gravitationally otherwise. As a consequence, the\npressure that counteracts the gravitational collapse is reduced while the\ngravitational force remains the same. This results in collapsed structures much\nlighter and smaller as compared to the ordinary single-sector case. We apply\nthis phenomenon to a dark matter theory that consists of $N$ dilute copies of\nthe Standard Model. The solutions do not rely on an exotic stabilization\nmechanism, but rather use the same well-understood properties as known stellar\nstructures. This framework also gives rise to new microscopic superheavy\nstructures, for example with mass $10^8\\,$g and size $10^{-13}\\,$cm. By\nconfronting the resulting objects with observational constraints, we find that,\ndue to a huge suppression factor entering the mass spectrum, these objects\nevade the strongest constrained region of the parameter space. Finally, we\ndiscuss possible formation scenarios of $N$-MACHOs.

Attosecond physics deals with phenomena occurring\nwhen ultrashort laser pulses, with duration on the femto- and sub-femtosecond\ntime scales, interact with atoms, molecules or solids. The laser-induced\nelectron dynamics occurs natively on a timescale down to a few hundred or even\ntens of attoseconds (1 attosecond=1 as=10$^{-18}$ s), which is of the order of\nthe optical field cycle. For comparison, the revolution of an electron on a\n$1s$ orbital of a hydrogen atom is $\\sim152$ as. On the other hand, the second\ntopic involves the manipulation and engineering of mesoscopic systems, such as\nsolids, metals, and dielectrics, with nanometric precision. Although\nnano-engineering is a vast and well-established research field on its own, the\ncombination with intense laser physics is relatively recent. We present a\ncomprehensive theoretical overview of the tools to tackle and understand the\nphysics that takes place when short and intense laser pulses interact with\nnanosystems, such as metallic and dielectric nanostructures. In particular, we\nelucidate how the spatially inhomogeneous laser-induced fields at a nanometer\nscale modify the laser-driven electron dynamics. Consequently, this has an\nimportant impact on pivotal processes such as above-threshold ionization and\nhigh-order harmonic generation. The deep understanding of the coupled dynamics\nbetween these spatially inhomogeneous fields and matter configures a promising\nway to new avenues of research and applications.

To exploit the location-dependent and spatially varying\nchannel as well as interference over the 3D space, we propose a new radio map\nbased path planning framework for the UAV. Specifically, we consider the\nchannel gain map of each GBS that provides its large-scale channel gains with\nuniformly sampled locations on a 3D grid, which are due to static and\nlarge-size obstacles (e.g., buildings) and thus assumed to be time-invariant.\nBased on the channel gain maps of GBSs as well as their loading factors, we\nthen construct an SINR map that depicts the expected SINR levels over the\nsampled 3D locations. By leveraging the obtained SINR map, we proceed to derive\nthe optimal UAV path by solving an equivalent shortest path problem (SPP) in\ngraph theory. We further propose a grid quantization approach where the grid\npoints in the SINR map are more coarsely sampled by exploiting the spatial\nchannel/interference correlation over neighboring grids. Then, we solve an\napproximate SPP over the reduced-size SINR map (graph) with reduced complexity.\nNumerical results show that the proposed solution can effectively minimize the\nflying distance/time of the UAV subject to its communication quality\nconstraint, and a flexible trade-off between performance and complexity can be\nachieved by adjusting the grid quantization ratio in the SINR map. Moreover,\nthe proposed solution significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes\nwithout fully exploiting the channel/interference spatial distribution in the\nnetwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 17:59:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 07:57:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

We examine the nature of this\nanti-correlation in the context of collimation by the progenitor stellar\nenvelope. First, we show that the data indicate a strong correlation between\ngamma-ray luminosity and jet opening angle, and suggest this is a natural\nselection effect - only the most luminous GRBs are able to successfully launch\njets with large opening angles. Then, by considering progenitor properties\nexpected to evolve through cosmic time, we show that denser stars lead to more\ncollimated jets; we argue that the apparent anti-correlation between opening\nangle and redshift can be accounted for if lGRB massive star progenitors at\nhigh redshifts have higher average density compared to those at lower\nredshifts. This may be viable for an evolving IMF - under the assumption that\naverage density scales directly with mass, this relationship is consistent with\nthe form of the IMF mass evolution suggested in the literature. The jet\nangle-redshift anti-correlation may also be explained if the lGRB progenitor\npopulation is dominated by massive stars at high redshift, while lower redshift\nlGRBs allow for a greater diversity of progenitor systems (that may fail to\ncollimate the jet as acutely).

However, due to\ntheir unconventional acoustic characteristics and operational manoeuvres, it is\nuncertain how communities will respond to drone operations. Noise has been\nsuggested as a major barrier to public acceptance of drone operations in urban\nareas. In this paper, a series of audio-visual scenarios were created to\ninvestigate the effects of drone noise on the reported loudness, annoyance and\npleasantness of seven different types of urban soundscapes. In soundscapes\nhighly impacted by road traffic noise, the presence of drone noise lead to\nsmall changes in the perceived loudness, annoyance and pleasantness.

Based on these results, the\nconcentration of drone operations along flight paths through busy roads might\naid in the mitigation of the overall community noise impact caused by drones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 23:08:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

Post-treatment imaging was obtained at 3-15 months\nafter 40 clinical TcMRgFUS procedures, and skull lesions were observed after\n16/40 treatments. The presence for lesions was predicted by the acoustic energy\nwith a threshold of 18.1-21.1 kJ (maximum acoustic energy) and 97-112 kJ (total\nacoustic energy). The size and degree of the lesions was not always predicted\nby the acoustic en-ergy used during treatment alone. In contrast, the heating\nestimated by the acoustic and thermal simulations was pre-dictive of the lesion\nextent. The lesions appeared in areas that were predicted to have high\ntemperatures, and when thin slice T2-weighted imaging was obtained at 3-15\nmonths, an excellent agreement was observed between the predictions and lesion\nlocations. While more work is needed to validate the absolute temperatures\nmeasurements in and around the skull, being able to predict the locations and\nonset for skull lesions could allow for better distribution of the acoustic\nenergy over the skull.

Recently,\nspatiotemporal mode-locking (STML) was proposed in lasers with small modal\n(i.e., transverse-mode) dispersion, which has been considered to be critical\nfor achieving STML in those cavities because the small dispersion can be easily\nbalanced. Here, we demonstrate that STML can also be achieved in multimode\nlasers with much larger modal dispersion, where we find that the intracavity\nsaturable absorber plays an important role for counteracting the large modal\ndispersion. Furthermore, we observe a new STML phenomenon of passive nonlinear\nauto-selection of single-mode mode-locking, resulting from the interaction\nbetween spatiotemporal saturable absorption and spatial gain competition.

The\nlargest energy is achieved by protons during centrifugal acceleration in the\nmagnetosphere of the central machine. When the proton accelerated in the\nmagnetosphere of a black hole approaches light cylinder surface, acceleration\noccurs mainly in the azimuthal direction, i.e. the acceleration is centrifugal.\nIn this paper the acceleration of a proton having smaller synchrotron losses\ncompared to the electron is considered. As a proton experiences the highest\nenergy increase while accelerating near the light surface, a partial solution\nfor the maximum Lorentz factor can be obtained there. In the analysis the\nobtained dependence of the maximum energy on the parameter of particle\nmagnetization $ \\kappa $ and parameter $ \\alpha $ which reflects the relation\nof toroidal $ B_\\phi $ and poloidal $ B_T $ magnetic fields , has led to the\nconclusion that the achievement of theoretical maximum limit of Lorentz factor\nvalue $ \\gamma_m=\\kappa^{-1}$ is not possible for an accelerated particle in\nthe magnetosphere of a black hole due to restrictions of the topology of\ntoroidal and poloidal magnetic fields imposed. The analysis of special cases of\nthe relation of toroidal and poloidal magnetic field has shown that in the\npresence of magnetic field that is significantly more toroidal the maximum\nLorentz factor value reaches $\\gamma_m = \\kappa^ {-2/3} $, in case when\ntoroidal field becomes smaller in comparison to poloidal field the maximum\nLorentz factor value does not exceed $\\gamma_m = \\kappa^ {-1/2} $. For a number\nof objects, such as M87 and Sgr. A *, maximum Lorentz factor values for\naccelerated protons for scenarios of existence or lack of toroidal magnetic\nfield have been derived.

Alternatively, learning behaviour from\neasy-to-collect human driving demonstrations is appealing. Prior work has\nstudied imitation learning (IL) for autonomous driving with a number of\nlimitations. Examples include only performing lane-following rather than\nfollowing a user-defined route, only using a single camera view or heavily\ncropped frames lacking state observability, only lateral (steering) control,\nbut not longitudinal (speed) control and a lack of interaction with traffic.\nImportantly, the majority of such systems have been primarily evaluated in\nsimulation - a simple domain, which lacks real-world complexities. Motivated by\nthese challenges, we focus on learning representations of semantics, geometry\nand motion with computer vision for IL from human driving demonstrations. As\nour main contribution, we present an end-to-end conditional imitation learning\napproach, combining both lateral and longitudinal control on a real vehicle for\nfollowing urban routes with simple traffic.

Recent progress in automatic neural architecture search (NAS) shows a\nlot of promise. However, discovered architectures often fail to generalize in\nthe final evaluation. Architectures with a higher validation accuracy during\nthe search phase may perform worse in the evaluation. Aiming to alleviate this\ncommon issue, we introduce sequential greedy architecture search (SGAS), an\nefficient method for neural architecture search. By dividing the search\nprocedure into sub-problems, SGAS chooses and prunes candidate operations in a\ngreedy fashion. We apply SGAS to search architectures for Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNN) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). Extensive experiments\nshow that SGAS is able to find state-of-the-art architectures for tasks such as\nimage classification, point cloud classification and node classification in\nprotein-protein interaction graphs with minimal computational cost.

For the\nintercept/resend attacks, we evaluate a probability that the legitimate users,\nAlice and Bob, do not notice interference caused by the eavesdropper Eve and a\nprobability that Eve obtains a secret bit sent by Alice. For the collective\nattacks, we estimate not only the above two probabilities but also Eve's\nShannon information. In the assessment of the security against the collective\nattacks, imposing looser constraints upon Eve's strategies than\nBechmann-Pasquinucci and Gisin, we reach substantially the same result as their\nstudy. In other words, although we let Eve's strategies satisfy lower symmetry\nthan Bechmann-Pasquinucci and Gisin, both their work and ours attain the same\nconclusion, i.e. the identical, unique, and optimum strategy. This implies that\nwe obtain Eve's best tactic by applying simpler conditions to it than\nBechmann-Pasquinucci and Gisin, so that this result is novel. Finally, we\nconsider a relation between the six-state protocol and the E91 scheme. We show\nthat the intercept/resend attacks can always be described by hidden variable\nmodels. In contrast, we demonstrate that we cannot regard the collective\nattacks as the hidden variable theories if the disturbance is smaller than\n$1/3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 2019 12:57:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

However,\nnuclei with spins larger than 1/2, experience electric quadrupole interaction\nwith electric field gradients at the cell walls. This quadrupole interaction\nshifts the precession frequencies of the nuclear spins, which brings inaccuracy\nto the rotation measurement as the quadrupole interaction constant $C_q$ is\ndifficult to precisely measure. In this work, the effects of quadrupole\ninteraction on nuclear magnetic resonance gyroscopes is theoretically studied.\nWe find that, when the constant $C_q$ is small compared to the characteristic\ndecay rate of the system, as the strength of the feedback-driving field\nincreases, the quadrupole shift monotonically decreases, regardless of the sign\nof $C_q$. In large $C_q$ regime, more than one precession frequency exists, and\nthe nuclear spins may precess with a single frequency or multi-frequencies\ndepending on initial conditions. In this regime, with large driving amplitudes,\nthe nuclear spin can restore the single-frequency-precession. These results are\nobtained by solving an effective master equation of the nuclear spins in a\nrotating frame, from which both the steady-state solutions and dynamics of the\nsystem are shown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 2019 15:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Nevertheless, it does\nnot depend directly on the EE of each link and its maximization leads to\nunfairness between the links. On the other hand, the maximization of the\nminimum EE (MEE), i.e., the minimum of the EEs of all links, guarantees the\nfairest power allocation, but it does not contain any explicit information\nabout the total system performance. The main trend in current research is to\nmaximize TEE and MEE separately.

In this paper, we describe a novel\nend-to-end deep learning-based method for generating compact representations of\nin situ hybridization (ISH) images, which are invariant-to-translation. In\ncontrast to traditional image processing methods, our method relies, instead,\non deep convolutional denoising autoencoders (CDAE) for processing raw pixel\ninputs, and generating the desired compact image representations.

Our methods improve the previous\nstate-of-the-art classification rate (Liscovitch, et al.) from an average AUC\nof 0.92 to 0.997, i.e., it achieves 96% reduction in error rate. Furthermore,\nthe representation vectors generated due to our method are more compact in\ncomparison to previous state-of-the-art methods, allowing for a more efficient\nhigh-level representation of images.

An important indicator of the quality of service in such\ninfrastructures is on-time performance at stops, with published transit\nschedules playing an integral role governing the level of success of the\nservice. However there are relatively few optimization architectures leveraging\nstochastic search that focus on optimizing bus timetables with the objective of\nmaximizing probability of bus arrivals at timepoints with delays within desired\non-time ranges. In addition to this, there is a lack of substantial research\nconsidering monthly and seasonal variations of delay patterns integrated with\nsuch optimization strategies. To address these,this paper makes the following\ncontributions to the corpus of studies on transit on-time performance\noptimization: (a) an unsupervised clustering mechanism is presented which\ngroups months with similar seasonal delay patterns, (b) the problem is\nformulated as a single-objective optimization task and a greedy algorithm, a\ngenetic algorithm (GA) as well as a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm\nare employed to solve it, (c) a detailed discussion on empirical results\ncomparing the algorithms are provided and sensitivity analysis on\nhyper-parameters of the heuristics are presented along with execution times,\nwhich will help practitioners looking at similar problems.
