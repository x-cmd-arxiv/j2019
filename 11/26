This prediction has been\nextensively tested, both experimentally and numerically, and is a core\nprediction of passive scalar turbulence.\n  In this article we provide a rigorous proof of a version of Batchelor's\nprediction in the $\\kappa \\to 0$ limit when the scalar is subjected to a\nspatially-smooth, white-in-time stochastic source and is advected by the 2D\nNavier-Stokes equations or 3D hyperviscous Navier-Stokes equations in\n$\\mathbb{T}^d$ forced by sufficiently regular, nondegenerate stochastic\nforcing. Although our results hold for fluids at arbitrary Reynolds number,\nthis value is fixed throughout. Our results rely on the quantitative\nunderstanding of Lagrangian chaos and passive scalar mixing established in our\nrecent works. Additionally, in the $\\kappa \\to 0$ limit, we obtain\nstatistically stationary, weak solutions in $H^{-\\epsilon}$ to the\nstochastically-forced advection problem without diffusivity. These solutions\nare almost-surely not locally integrable distributions with non-vanishing\naverage anomalous flux and satisfy the Batchelor spectrum at all sufficiently\nsmall scales. We also prove an Onsager-type criticality result which shows that\nno such dissipative, weak solutions with a little more regularity can exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 16:00:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 16:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-24"}

In many problems, however, the data is highly imbalanced in regard\nto different classes or does not have good coverage of the feasible data space\nwhich, in turn, creates problems in validation and usage phase. In this paper,\nwe propose a technique for synthesising feasible and likely data to help\nbalance the classes as well as to boost the performance in terms of confusion\nmatrix as well as overall. The idea, in a nutshell, is to synthesise data\nsamples in close vicinity to the actual data samples specifically for the less\nrepresented (minority) classes. This has also implications to the so-called\nfairness of machine learning. In this paper, we propose a specific method for\nsynthesising data in a way to balance the classes and boost the performance,\nespecially of the minority classes. It is generic and can be applied to\ndifferent base algorithms, e.g. support vector machine, k-nearest neighbour,\ndeep networks, rule-based classifiers, decision trees, etc. The results\ndemonstrated that: i) a significantly more balanced (and fair) classification\nresults can be achieved; ii) that the overall performance as well as the\nperformance per class measured by confusion matrix can be boosted. In addition,\nthis approach can be very valuable for the cases when the number of actual\navailable labelled data is small which itself is one of the problems of the\ncontemporary machine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 16:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

We propose a two-species reaction-diffusion\nmodel based on the single-species Klausmeier model, to analytically investigate\nthe existence of states in which both species coexist. Ecologically, the study\nfinds that coexistence is supported if there is a small difference in the plant\nspecies' average fitness, measured by the ratio of a species' capabilities to\nconvert water into new biomass to its mortality rate. Mathematically,\ncoexistence is not a stable solution of the system, but both spatially uniform\nand patterned coexistence states occur as metastable states. In this context, a\nmetastable solution in which both species coexist corresponds to a long\ntransient (exceeding $10^3$ years in dimensional parameters) to a stable\none-species state. This behaviour is characterised by the small size of a\npositive eigenvalue which has the same order of magnitude as the average\nfitness difference between the two species. Two mechanisms causing the\noccurrence of metastable solutions are established: a spatially uniform\nunstable equilibrium and a stable one-species pattern which is unstable to the\nintroduction of a competitor. We further discuss effects of asymmetric\ninterspecific competition (e.g. shading) on the metastability property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 16:11:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

Non-invasive functional MRI (fMRI) characterizes brain connectivity\nand may be used to inform diagnoses and democratize medicine. However,\nsuccessful construction of deep learning models from fMRI requires addressing\nkey choices about the model's architecture, including the number of layers and\nnumber of neurons per layer. Meanwhile, deriving functional connectivity (FC)\nfeatures from fMRI requires choosing an atlas with an appropriate level of\ngranularity. Once a model has been built, it is vital to determine which\nfeatures are predictive of ASD and if similar features are learned across atlas\ngranularity levels. To identify aptly suited architectural configurations,\nprobability distributions of the configurations of high versus low performing\nmodels are compared. To determine the effect of atlas granularity, connectivity\nfeatures are derived from atlases with 3 levels of granularity and important\nfeatures are ranked with permutation feature importance. Results show the\nhighest performing models use between 2-4 hidden layers and 16-64 neurons per\nlayer, granularity dependent. Connectivity features identified as important\nacross all 3 atlas granularity levels include FC to the supplementary motor\ngyrus and language association cortex, regions associated with deficits in\nsocial and sensory processing in ASD. Importantly, the cerebellum, often not\nincluded in functional analyses, is also identified as a region whose abnormal\nconnectivity is highly predictive of ASD. Results of this study identify\nimportant regions to include in future studies of ASD, help assist in the\nselection of network architectures, and help identify appropriate levels of\ngranularity to facilitate the development of accurate diagnostic models of ASD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 16:15:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 21:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

Our results focus on planetary mass which neither the\nradial velocity nor transit techniques for planet identification can provide\nalone.

In this paper, we replace\nthe diffusion term describing plant dispersal by a more realistic nonlocal\nconvolution integral to account for the possibility of long-range dispersal of\nseeds. Our analysis focuses on the rainfall level at which there is a\ntransition between uniform vegetation and pattern formation. We obtain results,\nvalid to leading order in the large parameter comparing the rate of water flow\ndownhill to the rate of plant dispersal, for a negative exponential dispersal\nkernel. Our results indicate that both a wider dispersal of seeds and an\nincrease in dispersal rate inhibit the formation of patterns.

The difficulty here is to define the notion\nof objectivity, since no ground-truth can properly serve as a basis of this\ndefinition. A natural approach is to consider the judgement of the other agents\nas a proxy for objectivity. Building on previous work by Parijs (who introduced\n\"unanimous envy\") we propose the notion of approval envy: an agent $a_i$\nexperiences approval envy towards $a_j$ if she is envious of $a_j$, and\nsufficiently many agents agree that this should be the case, from their own\nperspectives. Some interesting properties of this notion are put forward.\nComputing the minimal threshold guaranteeing approval envy clearly inherits\nwell-known intractable results from envy-freeness, but (i) we identify some\ntractable cases such as house allocation; and (ii) we provide a general method\nbased on a mixed integer programming encoding of the problem, which proves to\nbe efficient in practice.

We then apply this theorem to show that the nonlinear\nsmoothing property holds, depending on the regularity of the initial data, for\nfive classical dispersive equations: in $\\mathbb{R}$, the cubic nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger, the Korteweg-de Vries, the modified Korteweg-de Vries and the\nderivative Schr\\\"odinger equations; in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the modified\nZakharov-Kuznetsov equation.

In the networks that deal with images, CNNs are the most\ntime-consuming layer of the networks. Usually, the solution to address the\ncomputation cost is to decrease the number of trainable parameters. This\nsolution usually comes with the cost of dropping the accuracy. Another problem\nwith this technique is that usually the cost of memory access is not taken into\naccount which results in insignificant speedup gain. The number of operations\nand memory access in a standard convolution layer is independent of the input\ncontent, which makes it limited for certain accelerations. We propose a simple\nmodification to a standard convolution to bridge this gap. We propose an\nadaptive convolution that adopts different kernel sizes (or radii) based on the\ncontent. The network can learn and select the proper radius based on the input\ncontent in a soft decision manner.

In experiments and calculations, we\nobserve pronounced differences in the shape of the Fe-partial VDOS between\nnon-hydrogenated and hydrogenated samples. This shows that hydrogen does not\nonly shift the temperature of the first-order phase transition, but also\naffects the elastic response of the Fe-subsystem significantly. In turn, the\nanomalous redshift of the Fe VDOS, observed by going to the low-volume PM\nphase, survives hydrogenation. As a consequence, the change in the Fe specific\nvibrational entropy $\\Delta S_\\mathrm{lat}$ across the phase transition has the\nsame sign as the magnetic and electronic contribution.

We show experimentally and by mathematical analysis that the\npresence of magnetic field improves the evaporation rates of ferrofluid\ndroplets. First we tackle the question of improved evaporation of the colloidal\ndroplets compared to water, and propose physical mechanisms to explain the\nsame. Experiments show that the changes in evaporation rates aided by the\nmagnetic field cannot be explained on the basis of changes in surface tension,\nor based on classical diffusion driven evaporation models. Probing using\nparticle image velocimetry shows that the internal advection kinetics of such\ndroplets plays a direct role towards the augmented evaporation rates by\nmodulating the associated Stefan flow. Infrared thermography reveal changes in\nthe thermal gradients within the droplet and evaluating the dynamic surface\ntension reveals presence of solutal gradients within the droplet, both brought\nabout by the external field. Based on the premise, a scaling analysis of the\ninternal magnetothermal and magnetosolutal ferroadvection behavior is\npresented. The model incorporates the role of the governing Hartmann number,\nthe magnetothermal Prandtl number and the magnetosolutal Schmidt number. The\nanalysis and stability maps reveal that the magneto-solutal ferroadvection is\nthe more dominant mechanism, and the model is able to predict the internal\nadvection velocities with accuracy. Further, another scaling model to predict\nthe modified Stefan flow is proposed, and is found to accurately predict the\nimproved evaporation rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 18:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

We assume a\nthermal freeze-out scenario and fix the gauge coupling constant using the relic\ndensity constraint.

If the heavy state can decay to the light state and a massless\nspecies, the inelastic up-scattering process can cool the halo and lead to core\ncollapse.

HL Tau was detected as a variable hard\nX-ray source by Chandra, typical of late-type magnetically-active coronal\nsources. No extended X-ray emission was seen along the HL Tau jet, or along the\njet of the T Tauri binary system XZ Tau located 23 arcsecs to its east.

When generalized to\nanisotropic chiral superconductors and three-dimensional chiral superfluids,\nthe theory similarly returns an accurate description. We also present a\ndetailed numerical study of the chiral phases in the BEC limit. Our study\nsuggests that, in both BCS and BEC phases the relative OAM of the individual\nCooper pairs contribute to the total OAM additively, and that in both phases\nthe corresponding macroscopic OAM density distribution is localized at the\nboundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 19:03:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2019 07:28:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 14:28:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

We show that systems with anyon-like defects can\nexhibit universal late-time dynamics that is stochastic, but fundamentally\nnon-classical, because some of the quantum information about the state is\ntopologically protected from the environment.\n  Our coarse-grained model describes one-dimensional systems with domain-wall\ndefects carrying Majorana modes. These defects undergo Brownian motion due to\ncoupling with a bath. Since the fermion parity of a given pair of defects is\nnonlocal, it cannot be measured by the bath until the two defects happen to\ncome into contact. We examine how such a system anneals to zero temperature via\nthe diffusion and pairwise annihilation of Majorana defects, and we\ncharacterize the nontrivial entanglement structure that arises in such\nstochastic processes.\n  Separately, we also investigate simplified \"quantum measurement circuits\" in\none or more dimensions, involving repeated pairwise measurement of fermion\nparities for a lattice of Majoranas. The dynamics of these circuits can be\nsolved by exact mappings to classical loop models. They yield analytically\ntractable examples of measurement-induced phase transitions, with critical\nentanglement structures that are governed by nonunitary conformal fixed points.\n  In the system of diffusing and annihilating Majorana defects, the relaxation\nto the ground state is analogous to coarsening in a classical 1D Ising model\nvia domain wall annihilation. Here, however, configurations are labeled not\nonly by the defect positions but by a nonlocal entanglement structure.

We adopt a Bayesian perspective of causal theory induction and use\nthese theories to transfer knowledge between environments. Given these general\ntheories, the goal is to train an agent by interactively exploring the problem\nspace to (i) discover, form, and transfer useful abstract and structural\nknowledge, and (ii) induce useful knowledge from the instance-level attributes\nobserved in the environment. A hierarchy of Bayesian structures is used to\nmodel abstract-level structural causal knowledge, and an instance-level\nassociative learning scheme learns which specific objects can be used to induce\nstate changes through interaction. This model-learning scheme is then\nintegrated with a model-based planner to achieve a task in the OpenLock\nenvironment, a virtual ``escape room'' with a complex hierarchy that requires\nagents to reason about an abstract, generalized causal structure.

The divergence is typically removed by the so-called\njellium approach. Recently, Wu, Zhang and Pantelides [WZP, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n119, 105501 (2017)] traced the origin of the divergence to the assumption that\ncharged defects are formed by physically removing electrons from or adding\nelectrons to the crystal, violating charge neutrality, a key principle of\nstatistical mechanics that determines the Fermi level. An alternative theory\nwas constructed by recognizing that \"charged\" defects form by trading carriers\nwith the energy bands, whereby supercells are always charge-neutral so that no\ndivergence is present and no ad-hoc procedures need to be adopted for\ncalculations. Here we give a more detailed exposition of the foundations of\nboth methods and show that the jellium approach can be derived from the\nstatistical-mechanics-backed WZP definition by steps whose validity cannot be\nassessed a priori. In particular, the divergence appears when the charge\ndensity of band carriers is dropped, leaving a supercharged crystal. In the\ncase of charged defects in two-dimensional (2D) materials, unphysical fields\nappear in vacuum regions. None of these pathological features are present in\nthe reformulated theory. Finally, we report new calculations in both bulk and\n2D materials. The WZP approach yields formation energies that differ from\njellium values by up to ~1 eV. By analyzing the spatial distribution of wave\nfunctions and defect potentials, we provide insights into the inner workings of\nboth methods and demonstrate that the failure of the jellium approach to\ninclude the neutralizing electron density of band carriers, as is the case in\nthe physical system, is responsible for the numerical differences between the\ntwo methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 19:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

Our goal is to test this hypothesis by searching for a slow,\ncompact outflow driven by Cha-MMS1 that would match the predictions of MHD\nsimulations for this short phase of star formation. We use the Atacama Large\nMillimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) to map Cha-MMS1 at high angular\nresolution in CO 3-2 and 13CO 3-2 as well as in continuum emission. We report\nthe detection of a bipolar outflow emanating from the central core, along a\n(projected) direction roughly parallel to the filament in which Cha-MMS1 is\nembedded and perpendicular to the large-scale magnetic field. The morphology of\nthe outflow indicates that its axis lies close to the plane of the sky. We\nmeasure velocities corrected for inclination of more than 90km/s which is\nclearly incompatible with the expected properties of a FHSC outflow. Several\nproperties of the outflow are determined and compared to previous studies of\nClass 0 and Class I protostars. The outflow of Cha-MMS1 has a much smaller\nmomentum force than the outflows of other Class 0 protostars. In addition, we\nfind a dynamical age of 200-3000yr indicating that Cha-MMS1 might be one of the\nyoungest ever observed Class 0 protostars. While the existence of the outflow\nsuggests the presence of a disk, no disk is detected in continuum emission and\nwe derive an upper limit of 55au to its radius.

One of their applications is to generate random\nbitstreams suitable for use in stochastic computing implementations. We\ndescribe a method for digitally programmable bitstream generation based on\npre-charge sense amplifiers. This generator is significantly more energy\nefficient than SMTJ-based bitstream generators that tune probabilities with\nspin currents and a factor of two more efficient than related CMOS-based\nimplementations. The true randomness of this bitstream generator allows us to\nuse them as the fundamental units of a novel neural network architecture. To\ntake advantage of the potential savings, we codesign the algorithm with the\ncircuit, rather than directly transcribing a classical neural network into\nhardware. The flexibility of the neural network mathematics allows us to adapt\nthe network to the explicitly energy efficient choices we make at the device\nlevel. The result is a convolutional neural network design operating at\n$\\approx$ 150 nJ per inference with 97 % performance on MNIST -- a factor of\n1.4 to 7.7 improvement in energy efficiency over comparable proposals in the\nrecent literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 20:11:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 14:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-09"}

The on-board\ncomputer of the satellite is responsible for initiating dataflow between\nonboard hardware, performing image compression, and run control algorithms like\nfine pointing, sun pointing, ground pointing for payload operation and idle\nstate detumbling. The actuation is carried out by interfacing magnetorquers and\nreaction wheels with the OBC. The software of the onboard computer is\nimplemented on a Linux based operating system run on the ARM Cortex A9\nprocessor which is part of the Zynq-7000 SoC. A Field Programmable Gate Array\n(FPGA) is used specifically for image compression. The compressed image is\nstored in a serial flash memory shared between the camera and the FPGA. The\narchitecture comprises of a system-wide I2C bus to which the sensors\ninterfaced. The collected data is used for logging followed by downlink and as\ninput to algorithms used for pointing and detumbling. An SPI interface is used\nbetween the Power Subsystem microcontroller and the On-Board Computer since a\nlarge amount of housekeeping data will have to be exchanged at high rates.\nReaction wheels and magnetorquers are actuated by current driver circuits which\nget the control signals from the OBC. The satellite is modelled as a Finite\nState Machine for software development. The states broadly fall under two\ncategories, Normal and Emergency. Each state has a predetermined set of logical\ntasks to be run, which are abstracted as separate processes in the memory.\nState transitions take place by polling the health metrics of the satellite.\nHowever, hardware interrupts are implemented on selected peripherals which\nensure an asynchronous switching to the Emergency States for safety. A review\nof some common fault detection, isolation and removal methods used shall\nconclude the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 20:41:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 15:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

One widely considered\nproduction mechanism, a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) produced as\na thermal relic, provides a target cross section for DM annihilation into SM\nparticles by solving the Boltzmann equation. In this thermal freeze-out\nmechanism, dark matter is produced in thermal equilibrium with the SM in the\nearly universe, and drops out of equilibrium to its observed abundance as the\nuniverse cools and expands. In this paper, we study the impact of a generalized\nthermodynamics, known as Tsallis statistics and governed by a parameter $q$, on\nthe target DM annihilation cross section. We derive the phase space\ndistributions of particles in this generalized statistical framework, and check\ntheir thermodynamic consistency, as well as analyzing the impact of this\ngeneralization on the collisional term of the Boltzmann equation. We consider\nthe case of an initial value of $q_0>1$, with $q$ relaxing to 1 as the universe\nexpands and cools, and solve the generalized Boltzmann numerically for several\nbenchmark DM masses, finding the corresponding target annihilation cross\nsections as a function of $q_0$.

In addition to treating the\ndrivers as individual agents, we consider the problem from a system-centric\nperspective, where a central fleet management agent is responsible for\ndecision-making for all drivers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 22:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

Although modern\ninstance segmentation cascades achieve leading performance, they mainly make\nuse of a unidirectional relationship, i.e., mask segmentation can benefit from\niteratively refined bounding box detection. In this paper, we investigate an\nalternative direction, i.e., how to take the advantage of precise mask\nsegmentation for bounding box detection in a cascade architecture. We propose a\nDeeply Shape-guided Cascade (DSC) for instance segmentation, which iteratively\nimposes the shape guidances extracted from mask prediction at the previous\nstage on bounding box detection at current stage. It forms a bi-directional\nrelationship between the two tasks by introducing three key components: (1)\nInitial shape guidance: A mask-supervised Region Proposal Network (mPRN) with\nthe ability to generate class-agnostic masks; (2) Explicit shape guidance: A\nmask-guided region-of-interest (RoI) feature extractor, which employs mask\nsegmentation at previous stage to focus feature extraction at current stage\nwithin a region aligned well with the shape of the instance-of-interest rather\nthan a rectangular RoI; (3) Implicit shape guidance: A feature fusion operation\nwhich feeds intermediate mask features at previous stage to the bounding box\nhead at current stage. Experimental results show that DSC outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art instance segmentation cascade, Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC), by a\nlarge margin and achieves 51.8 box AP and 45.5 mask AP on COCO test-dev.

The proposed fileless\nmalware could infect any device that supports Javascript and HTML5. It serves\nas a proof-of-concept (PoC) to demonstrate the threats of fileless malware in\nweb applications. We used the proposed fileless malware to evaluate existing\nmethods and techniques for malware detection in web applications. We tested the\nproposed fileless malware with several free and commercial malware detection\ntools that apply both static and dynamic analysis. The proposed fileless\nmalware bypassed all the anti-malware detection tools included in our study. In\nour analysis, we discussed the limitations of existing approaches/tools and\nsuggested possible detection and mitigation techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 23:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

Our model is a variation of the\nquasi-Heisenberg model with fields in both x and y directions. We found that\nwhile our model shares some characteristics for MBl, as seen by other\nquasi-Heisenberg models, the adjacent gap ratio for our system falls well below\nthe expected Poisson limit when it transitions to an MBL phase. A similar model\nto ours has been experimentally realized in [11], and so we are motivated\nfurther to study MBL characteristics. To determine the characteristics of the\nsystem when transitioning from the ergodic to MBL phase, we calculate the\nquantities: entanglement entropy, adjacent gap ratio, and the probability\ndistributions for both. We calculate the aforementioned quantities through the\neigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system's Hamiltonian, which are obtained\nthrough exact diagonalization.

A commonly used model for dynamic\npatterns is the state space model, where the state evolves over time according\nto a transition model and the state generates the observed image frames\naccording to an emission model. To model the motions explicitly, it is natural\nfor the model to be based on the motions or the displacement fields of the\npixels. Thus in the emission model, we let the hidden state generate the\ndisplacement field, which warps the trackable component in the previous image\nframe to generate the next frame while adding a simultaneously emitted residual\nimage to account for the change that cannot be explained by the deformation.\nThe warping of the previous image is about the trackable part of the change of\nimage frame, while the residual image is about the intrackable part of the\nimage. We use a maximum likelihood algorithm to learn the model that iterates\nbetween inferring latent noise vectors that drive the transition model and\nupdating the parameters given the inferred latent vectors. Meanwhile we adopt a\nregularization term to penalize the norms of the residual images to encourage\nthe model to explain the change of image frames by trackable motion. Unlike\nexisting methods on dynamic patterns, we learn our model in unsupervised\nsetting without ground truth displacement fields. In addition, our model\ndefines a notion of intrackability by the separation of warped component and\nresidual component in each image frame. We show that our method can synthesize\nrealistic dynamic pattern, and disentangling appearance, trackable and\nintrackable motions. The learned models are useful for motion transfer, and it\nis natural to adopt it to define and measure intrackability of a dynamic\npattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 00:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

However, its requirement for the deterministic\nexecution of transactions often results in single-threaded replicas, which\ncannot fully exploit the multicore capabilities of today's processors.\nTherefore, parallel SMR has become a hot topic of recent research. The basic\nidea behind it is that independent transactions can be executed in parallel,\nwhile dependent transactions must be executed in their relative order to ensure\nconsistency among replicas. The dependency detection of existing parallel SMR\nmethods is mainly based on pairwise transaction comparison or batch comparison.\nThese methods cannot simultaneously guarantee both effective detection and\nconcurrent execution. Moreover, the scheduling process cannot execute\nconcurrently, which introduces extra scheduling overhead as well. In order to\nfurther reduce scheduling overhead and ensure the parallel execution of\ntransactions, we propose an efficient scheduler based on a specific index\nstructure.

Despite widely explored low-dimensional anisotropy, strengthening\nsuper-exchange couplings has rarely been investigated. Here, we found that\nligands with lower electronegativity can strengthen ferromagnetic\nsuper-exchange couplings and further proposed the ligand modulation strategy to\nenhance the Curie temperature of low-dimensional ferromagnets.

The\nunprecedented tunability of 2D materials is also accompanied by many and\nequally great challenges, as they are susceptible to defects and disorders. The\npresence of defects and disorders induces the inhomogeneity of electronic\nstates, often making it difficult to directly probe the intrinsic properties of\nmaterials. Therefore, many efforts have been devoted to improve the electronic\nhomogeneity, for example, by reducing the density of defects and disorders in\nthe materials and at the interface. However, little attention is paid to the\ndisorders embedded in underlying substrates. Here we investigate how individual\ndopants in substrate interact with 2D materials and give rise to the\nelectron-hole puddles by low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)\nand spectroscopy (STS).

Specifically, we first use\nan auxiliary classification network to guide the generation of TIR-specific\ndiscriminative features for distinguishing the TIR objects belonging to\ndifferent classes. Second, we design a fine-grained aware module to capture\nmore subtle information for distinguishing the TIR objects belonging to the\nsame class. These two kinds of features complement each other and recognize TIR\nobjects in the levels of inter-class and intra-class respectively. These two\nfeature models are learned using a multi-task matching framework and are\njointly optimized on the TIR tracking task. In addition, we develop a\nlarge-scale TIR training dataset to train the network for adapting the model to\nthe TIR domain. Extensive experimental results on three benchmarks show that\nthe proposed algorithm achieves a relative gain of 10% over the baseline and\nperforms favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.

For visual dialog, it\nbecomes necessary to consider interactions between three or more inputs, i.e.,\nan image, a question, and a dialog history, or even its individual dialog\ncomponents. In this paper, we present a neural architecture named Light-weight\nTransformer for Many Inputs (LTMI) that can efficiently deal with all the\ninteractions between multiple such inputs in visual dialog.

Thus, backscatter tags are failed to fully utilize the\noptimal transmission rate. In this paper, we design a system named COOK with\nself-reliant bitrate adaptation in backscatter communication.

However, because of the different receptive fields of different\nconvolutional layers, there exists big differences between features generated\nby these layers. Common feature fusion strategies (addition or concatenation)\nignore these differences and may cause suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we\npropose the F3Net to solve above problem, which mainly consists of cross\nfeature module (CFM) and cascaded feedback decoder (CFD) trained by minimizing\na new pixel position aware loss (PPA). Specifically, CFM aims to selectively\naggregate multi-level features. Different from addition and concatenation, CFM\nadaptively selects complementary components from input features before fusion,\nwhich can effectively avoid introducing too much redundant information that may\ndestroy the original features. Besides, CFD adopts a multi-stage feedback\nmechanism, where features closed to supervision will be introduced to the\noutput of previous layers to supplement them and eliminate the differences\nbetween features. These refined features will go through multiple similar\niterations before generating the final saliency maps. Furthermore, different\nfrom binary cross entropy, the proposed PPA loss doesn't treat pixels equally,\nwhich can synthesize the local structure information of a pixel to guide the\nnetwork to focus more on local details. Hard pixels from boundaries or\nerror-prone parts will be given more attention to emphasize their importance.\nF3Net is able to segment salient object regions accurately and provide clear\nlocal details. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat F3Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on six evaluation metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 10:41:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

Previous studies have shown that spike-timing-dependent plasticity\ncan facilitate the transfer of rhythmic activity downstream the information\nprocessing pathway. However, STDP has also been known to generate strong\nwinner-take-all like competitions between subgroups of correlated synaptic\ninputs. Consequently, one might expect that STDP would induce strong\ncompetition between different rhythmicity channels thus preventing the\nmultiplexing of information across different frequency channels. This study\nexplored whether STDP facilitates the multiplexing of information across\nmultiple frequency channels, and if so, under what conditions. We investigated\nthe STDP dynamics in the framework of a model consisting of two competing\nsubpopulations of neurons that synapse in a feedforward manner onto a single\npostsynaptic neuron. Each sub-population was assumed to oscillate in an\nindependent manner and in a different frequency band. To investigate the STDP\ndynamics, a mean field Fokker-Planck theory was developed in the limit of the\nslow learning rate. Surprisingly, our theory predicted limited interactions\nbetween the different sub-groups. Our analysis further revealed that the\ninteraction between these channels was mainly mediated by the shared component\nof the mean activity. Next, we generalized these results beyond the simplistic\nmodel using numerical simulations. We found that for a wide range of\nparameters, the system converged to a solution in which the post-synaptic\nneuron responded to both rhythms. Nevertheless, all the synaptic weights\nremained dynamic and did not converge to a fixed point. These findings imply\nthat STDP can support the multiplexing of rhythmic information and demonstrate\nhow functionality can be retained in the face of continuous remodeling of all\nthe synaptic weights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 11:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

Moreover, due\nto IP tunneling, some extra headers are added to the IPv6 packet, exceeding the\npacket size higher than the maximum transmission unit (MTU), resulting in\nincrease in packet drops. One probable solution is to find the MTU of every\nlink in advance using the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets and\naccordingly fragment the packets at the source itself.

In particular we aim to differentiate randomness that is\nintroduced through external noise (quantum stochastic calculus) and randomness\nthat is fundamental to a quantum system (Heisenberg Equation of Motion).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 11:52:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 10:43:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 17:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-27"}

This is the first review of its use, and the aspects of\nits computation and presentation that could affect inferences drawn and bias\nestimates of the statistic.\n  Methods\n  Using Google Scholar we searched papers or preprints that cited the papers\nthat first defined/reformed the statistic. We tabulated their key\ncharacteristics to understand the statistic's development since 2012.\n  Results\n  Only half of the 16 studies found were considered to be using true tau\nstatistics, but their inclusion in the review still provided important insights\ninto their analysis motivations. All papers that used graphical hypothesis\ntesting and parameter estimation used incorrect methods. There is a lack of\nclarity over how to choose the time-relatedness interval to relate cases and\nthe distance band set, that are both required to calculate the statistic. Some\nstudies demonstrated nuanced applications of the tau statistic in settings with\nunusual data or time relation variables, which enriched understanding of its\npossibilities. A gap was noticed in the estimators available to account for\nvariable person-time at risk.\n  Discussion\n  Our review comprehensively covers current uses of the tau statistic for\ndescriptive analysis, graphical hypothesis testing, and parameter estimation of\nspatiotemporal clustering. We also define a new estimator of the tau statistic\nfor disease rates. For the tau statistic there are still open questions on its\nimplementation which we hope this review inspires others to research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 11:53:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2019 13:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

The mass bias is expected to be significant because\nconstructions of cluster samples from peaks in weak lensing mass maps and\nmeasurements of cluster masses from their tangential shear profiles share the\nsame noise. We quantify this mass bias from large sets of mock cluster samples\nwith analytical density profiles and realistic large-scale structure noise from\nray-tracing simulations. We find that, even for peaks with signal-to-noise\nratio larger than $4.0$ in weak lensing mass maps constructed in a deep survey\nwith a high source galaxy number density of $30~\\mathrm{arcmin}^{-2}$, derived\nweak lensing masses for these shear-selected clusters are still biased high by\n$\\sim55\\%$ on average. Such a large bias mainly originates from up-scattered\nlow mass objects, which is an inevitable consequence of selecting clusters with\na noisy observable directly linked to the mass measurement. We also investigate\nthe dependence of the mass bias on different physical and observational\nparameters, finding that the mass bias strongly correlates with cluster\nredshifts, true halo masses, and selection signal-to-noise thresholds, but\nhaving moderate dependence on observed weak lensing masses and survey depths.\nThis bias, albeit considerable, can still be modeled accurately in statistical\nstudies of shear-selected clusters as the intrinsic scatter around the mean\nbias is found to be reasonable in size.

In fact, this is a significant speedup for equal mass ratio binaries,\nand becomes extreme for unequal mass ratios, e.g. 1:10 or 1:100, which\ntraditional dynamical friction alone would not permit to bind. (ii) The\nsubsequent binary hardening is driven by the gravitational slingshots between\nthe SMBH binary and stars, and also depends on the mass ratio between the\nSMBHs. Thus, with this additional drag force, we find that all SMBHs in our\nsuite coalesce within a Hubble time.

Inspired by recent PIC simulations of relativistic\nturbulence, which show that electrons are impulsively heated in intermittent\ncurrent sheets by a strong electric field aligned with the local magnetic\nfield, we instead argue that in plasmas where the particle number density is\ndominated by the pairs (electron-positron and electron-positron-ion plasmas):\n(i) as an effect of fast cooling and of different injection times, the electron\nenergy distribution is ${\\rm d}n_e/{\\rm d}\\gamma\\propto\\gamma^{-2}$ for\n$\\gamma\\lesssim\\gamma_{\\rm heat}$ (the Lorentz factor $\\gamma_{\\rm heat}$ being\nclose to the equipartition value), while the distribution steepens at higher\nenergies; (ii) since the time scales for the turbulent fields to decay and for\nthe photons to escape are of the same order, the magnetic and the radiation\nenergy densities in the dissipation region are comparable; (iii) if the mass\nenergy of the plasma is dominated by the ion component, the pairs with a\nLorentz factor smaller than a critical one (of the order of the\nproton-to-electron mass ratio) become isotropic, while the pitch angle remains\nsmall otherwise.

However,\nthey remain a difficult technical challenge because in most cases it is not\nknown how to perform the sum over planar graphs, which dominate the models at\nlarge $N$. In this thesis, we study large $D$ matrix models, which provide a\nframework to build new limits for matrix models in which the sum over planar\ngraphs simplifies when $D$ is large. The basic degrees of freedom are real\nmatrices of size $N\\times N$ with $r$ additional indices of range $D$. They can\nbe interpreted as a real tensor of rank $R=r+2$ with indices of different\nranges, making a compelling connection with tensor models. We define a new\nlarge $D$ limit for the sum over Feynman graphs of fixed genus in matrix\nmodels, based on an enhanced large $D$ scaling of the coupling constants. Then,\nwe show that the resulting large $D$ expansion is well-defined and organized\naccording to a half-integer called the index. When $N=D$, the result provides a\nnew large $N$ limit for general $\\text{O}(N)^R$ invariant tensor models. In the\nlarge $D$ limit, the sum over planar graphs of large $N$ matrix models\nsimplifies to a non-trivial sum over generalized melonic graphs. This class of\ngraphs extends the one obtained in tensor models with standard scaling and\nallows for a wider class of interactions, including all the maximally\nsingle-trace terms. The general classification of generalized melonic graphs\nremains an open problem. However, in the case of the complete interaction of\norder $R+1$ for $R$ a prime number, we identify them in detail and demonstrate\nthat they exhibit the same important features as the SYK model with\n$q=(R+1)$-fold random interactions, including the emergent conformal symmetry\nin the infrared regime and maximal chaos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 14:41:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

Four\nstandard sinusoidal fringe-patterns with phase shift step of , which are used\nas calibration templates, are shown on a Liquid Crystal Display screen, and\ncaptured by the wide-angle lens imaging system. A four-step phase-shifting\nmethod is employed to obtain the radial phase distribution of the distorted\nfringe-pattern.

The heterogeneity arises from\nprosumers' evaluation of energy contracts through multiple societal and\nenvironmental criteria and the prosumers' private preferences over those\ncriteria. The prosumers engage in bilateral negotiations with peers to mutually\nagree on periodical energy contracts/loans consisting of the energy volume to\nbe exchanged at that period and the return time of the exchanged energy. The\nnegotiating prosumers navigate through a common negotiation domain consisting\nof potential energy contracts and evaluate those contracts from their\nvaluations on the entailed criteria against a utility function that is robust\nagainst generation and demand uncertainty. From the repeated interactions, a\nprosumer gradually learns about the compatibility of its peers in reaching\nenergy contracts that are closer to Nash solutions.

Non-initiator determinants (i.e. determinants whose population is\nbelow the initiator threshold) are subject to a systematic {\\em undersampling}\nbias, which in large systems leads to a bias in the energy when an insufficient\nnumber of walkers is used. We show that the acceptance probability ($p_{acc}$),\nthat a non-initiator determinant has its spawns accepted, can be used to unbias\nthe initiator bias, in a simple and accurate manner, by reducing the applied\nshift to the non-initiator proportionately to $p_{acc}$. This modification\npreserves the property that in the large walker limit, when\n$p_{acc}\\rightarrow1$, the unbiasing procedure disappears, and the initiator\napproximation becomes exact. We demonstrate that this algorithm shows rapid\nconvergence to the FCI limit with respect to walker number, and furthermore\nlargely removes the dependence of the algorithm on the initiator threshold,\nenabling highly accurate results to be obtained even with large values of the\nthreshold. This is exemplified in the case of butadiene/ANO-L-pVDZ and\nbenzene/cc-pVDZ, correlating 22 and 30 electrons in 82 and 108 orbitals\nrespectively. In butadiene $5\\times 10^7$ and in benzene $10^8$ walkers suffice\nto obtain an energy to within a milli-Hartree of the CCSDT(Q) result, in\nHilbert spaces of $10^{26}$ and $10^{35}$ respectively. Essentially converged\nresults require $\\sim 10^8$ walkers for butadiene and $\\sim 10^9$ walkers for\nbenzene, and lie slightly lower than CCSDT(Q). Owing to large-scale\nparallelisability, these calculations can be executed in a matter of hours on a\nfew hundred processors. The present method largely solves the initiator-bias\nproblems that the initiator method suffered from when applied to medium-sized\nmolecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 00:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-13"}

As the areas of application broaden, the requirements for\nthe MEMS are increasing. Devices outside of the performance specifications have\nto be rejected which is costly due to the high processing times of MEMS\ntechnologies. In particular, nonlinear system behavior is often found to cause\nunexpected device failure or performance issues. Thus, accurate simulation or\nrather system models which account for nonlinear sensor dynamics can not only\nincrease process yield, but more importantly, lead to a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the underlying physics and to improved MEMS design. We have\nstudied [1] the possibility of a rather drastic device failure induced by\nnonlinearities on the example of a resonant scanning MEMS micro mirror. On the\nlevel of a few selected chips, we have carefully measured the complex nonlinear\nsystem behavior and modeled it by a nonlinear mode-coupling phenomenon known as\nspontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). The most intriguing feature of\nSPDC is the sudden change from a rather linear to a nonlinear system behavior\nat the critical oscillation amplitude. However, the threshold only lies within\nthe range of the mirror's operational amplitude, if certain frequency resonance\nconditions regarding the mechanical modes are met. Thus, the critical amplitude\nstrongly depends on the frequency spectrum of the MEMS design which in turn is\nlargely influenced by fabrication imperfections. We validate the dependence of\nthe critical amplitude on the resonance condition by measuring it for over 600\nmicro mirrors on wafer-level.

Recently, heterogeneous network has shown to\nbe effective in representing diverse information in data. However,\nheterogeneous network embedding suffers from the imbalance issue, i.e. the size\nof relation types (or the number of edges in the network regarding the type) is\nimbalanced. In this paper, we devise a new heterogeneous network embedding\nmethod, called BHIN2vec, which considers the balance among all relation types\nin a network. We view the heterogeneous network embedding as simultaneously\nsolving multiple tasks in which each task corresponds to each relation type in\na network. After splitting the skip-gram loss into multiple losses\ncorresponding to different tasks, we propose a novel random-walk strategy to\nfocus on the tasks with high loss values by considering the relative training\nratio. Unlike previous random walk strategies, our proposed random-walk\nstrategy generates training samples according to the relative training ratio\namong different tasks, which results in a balanced training for the node\nembedding. Our extensive experiments on node classification and recommendation\ndemonstrate the superiority of BHIN2vec compared to the state-of-the-art\nmethods. Also, based on the relative training ratio, we analyze how much each\nrelation type is represented in the embedding space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 12:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-21"}

The criticality of most applications of\nWSNs and also their unattended nature, makes sensor nodes often susceptible to\nmany types of attacks. Based on this fact, it is clear that cluster heads (CHs)\nare the most attacked targets by attackers, and also according to their\ncritical operations in CWSNs, their compromise and control by an attacker will\ndisrupt the entire cluster and sometimes the entire network, so their security\nneeds more attentiveness and must be ensured. In this paper, we introduce a\nhybrid Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) for securing CHs, to take advantages\nof both anomaly-based and misuse-based detection methods, that is high\ndetection and low false alarm rate. Also by using a novel preprocessing model,\nsignificantly reduces the computational and memory complexities of the proposed\nIDS, and finally allows the use of the clustering algorithms for it. The\nsimulation results show that the proposed IDS in comparison to existing works,\nwhich often have high computational and memory complexities, can be as an\neffective and lightweight IDS for securing CHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 05:15:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-30"}

The qualitative,\nphenomenal nature of conscious experiences also cannot be communicated to\nothers in the form of a message composed of classical bits of information.\nBecause in a classical world everything physical is observable and\ncommunicable, it is a daunting task to explain how an empirically unobservable,\nincommunicable consciousness could have any physical substrates such as neurons\ncomposed of biochemical molecules, water, and electrolytes. The challenges\nencountered by classical physics are exemplified by a number of thought\nexperiments including the inverted qualia argument, the private language\nargument, the beetle in the box argument and the knowledge argument. These\nthought experiments, however, do not imply that our consciousness is\nnonphysical and our introspective conscious testimonies are untrustworthy. The\nprinciples of classical physics have been superseded by modern quantum physics,\nwhich contains two fundamentally different kinds of physical objects:\nunobservable quantum state vectors, which define what physically exists, and\nquantum operators (observables), which define what can physically be observed.\nIdentifying consciousness with the unobservable quantum information contained\nby quantum physical brain states allows for application of quantum information\ntheorems to resolve possible paradoxes created by the inner privacy of\nconscious experiences, and explains how the observable brain is constructed by\naccessible bits of classical information that are bound by Holevo's theorem and\nextracted from the physically existing quantum brain upon measurement with\nphysical devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 09:36:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-06"}
