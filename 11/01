Simulation: correctness of a new data representation and\nimplementation can be established by proving simulation between the old and new\nimplementations using a coupling relation defined on the encapsulated state.\nThese results were formalized semantically and for a simple model of state,\nthough the paper claimed this could be extended to encompass dynamically\nallocated objects. In recent years, progress has been made towards formalizing\nthe claim, for simulation, though mainly in semantic developments. In this\narticle, hiding and simulation are combined with the idea in Hoare's 1969\npaper: a logic of programs. For an object-based language with dynamic\nallocation, we introduce a relational Hoare logic with stateful frame\nconditions that formalizes encapsulation, hiding of invariants, and couplings\nthat relate two implementations. Relations and other assertions are expressed\nin first-order logic. Specifications can express a wide range of relational\nproperties such as conditional equivalence and noninterference with\ndeclassification. The proof rules facilitate relational reasoning by means of\nconvenient alignments and are shown sound with respect to a conventional\noperational semantics.

Because neural networks are opaque, certifying their\ncorrectness is a significant challenge. To address this issue, several neural\nnetwork verification approaches have recently been proposed. However, these\napproaches afford limited scalability, and applying them to large networks can\nbe challenging. In this paper, we propose a framework that can enhance neural\nnetwork verification techniques by using over-approximation to reduce the size\nof the network - thus making it more amenable to verification. We perform the\napproximation such that if the property holds for the smaller (abstract)\nnetwork, it holds for the original as well. The over-approximation may be too\ncoarse, in which case the underlying verification tool might return a spurious\ncounterexample. Under such conditions, we perform counterexample-guided\nrefinement to adjust the approximation, and then repeat the process. Our\napproach is orthogonal to, and can be integrated with, many existing\nverification techniques.

Modern dialog systems typically\nbegin by converting conversation history to a symbolic object referred to as\nbelief state by using supervised learning. The belief state is then used to\nreason on an external knowledge source whose result along with the conversation\nhistory is used in action prediction and response generation tasks\nindependently. Such a pipeline of individually optimized components not only\nmakes the development process cumbersome but also makes it non-trivial to\nleverage session-level user reinforcement signals. In this paper, we develop\nNeural Assistant: a single neural network model that takes conversation history\nand an external knowledge source as input and jointly produces both text\nresponse and action to be taken by the system as output. The model learns to\nreason on the provided knowledge source with weak supervision signal coming\nfrom the text generation and the action prediction tasks, hence removing the\nneed for belief state annotations. In the MultiWOZ dataset, we study the effect\nof distant supervision, and the size of knowledge base on model performance. We\nfind that the Neural Assistant without belief states is able to incorporate\nexternal knowledge information achieving higher factual accuracy scores\ncompared to Transformer. In settings comparable to reported baseline systems,\nNeural Assistant when provided with oracle belief state significantly improves\nlanguage generation performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 17:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-01"}

While the basic mechanisms underlying morphogenesis\nare known in eukaryotes, it is often difficult to manipulate them in vivo. To\ncircumvent this issue, here we present a study of developing Vibrio cholerae\nbiofilms grown on agar substrates in which the spatiotemporal morphological\npatterns were altered by varying the agar concentration. Expanding biofilms are\ninitially flat, but later experience a mechanical instability and become\nwrinkled. Whereas the peripheral region develops ordered radial stripes, the\ncentral region acquires a zigzag herringbone-like wrinkle pattern. Depending on\nthe agar concentration, the wrinkles initially appear either in the peripheral\nregion and propagate inward (low agar concentration) or in the central region\nand propagate outward (high agar concentration). To understand these\nexperimental observations, we developed a model that considers diffusion of\nnutrients and their uptake by bacteria, bacterial growth/biofilm matrix\nproduction, mechanical deformation of both the biofilm and the agar, and the\nfriction between them. Our model demonstrates that depletion of nutrients\nbeneath the central region of the biofilm results in radially-dependent growth\nprofiles, which in turn, produce anisotropic stresses that dictate the\nmorphology of wrinkles. Furthermore, we predict that increasing surface\nfriction (agar concentration) reduces stress anisotropy and shifts the location\nof the maximum compressive stress, where the wrinkling instability first\noccurs, toward the center of the biofilm, in agreement with our experimental\nobservations. Our results are broadly applicable to bacterial biofilms with\nsimilar morphologies and also provide insight into how other bacterial biofilms\nform distinct wrinkle patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 17:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

Nearest neighbor repulsion is also found to induce competing\ncharge density wave (CDW) that may erode the real space FS. The underlying\nphysics surrounding criticality and localization is further analyzed with\ncomplex flux spectral flows. Our findings can be experimentally demonstrated\nwith ultracold fermions in a suitably designed optical lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 18:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

The computationally cheapest formulation of lattice QCD, rooted\nstaggered fermions, with the usual definition of the rooted determinant, does\nnot admit such a Lee-Yang polynomial.

One side-effect of this applied\npressure, however, is that it compresses the filter. This changes the\npermeability, which may affect its performance. As the applied pressure\nincreases the flux of fluid processed by the filter will also increase but the\npermeability will decrease. Eventually the permeability reaches zero at a point\nin the filter and the fluid flux falls to zero.

We use this to determine the maximum operating\nflux that can be achieved without the permeability reaching zero and the filter\nshutting down.

The so-called neural or brain\nplasticity facilitates the modification of brain structure and function over\ndifferent time scales. Plasticity might occur due to external stimuli received\nfrom the environment, during recovery from brain injury, or due to\nmodifications within the body and brain itself. In this paper, we study the\ncombined effect of short-term (STP) and spike-timing-dependent plasticities\n(STDP) on the synaptic strength of excitatory coupled Hodgkin-Huxley neurons\nand show that plasticity can facilitate the formation of modular neural\nnetworks with complex topologies that resemble those of networks with\npreferential attachment properties. In particular, we use an STDP rule that\nalters the synaptic coupling intensity based on time intervals between spikes\nof postsynaptic and presynaptic neurons. Previous works have shown that STDP\nmay induce the appearance of directed connections from high to low-frequency\nspiking neurons. On the other hand, STP is attributed to the release of\nneurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft of neurons that alter its synaptic\nefficiency. Our results suggest that the combined effect of STP and STDP with\nhigh recovery time facilitates the formation of connections among neurons with\nsimilar spike frequencies only, a kind of preferential attachment. We then\npursue this further and show that, when starting with all-to-all neural\nconfigurations, depending on the STP recovery time and distribution of neural\nfrequencies, modular neural networks can emerge as a direct result of the\ncombined effect of STP and STDP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 18:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-04"}

A bump-like feature behaves like a local\nspeed-breaker and lowers the speed of the scalar field, thereby locally\nenhancing the scalar power spectrum. A bump-like feature emerges naturally if\nthe base inflaton potential $V_b(\\phi)$ contains a local correction term such\nas $V_b(\\phi)\\left[1+\\varepsilon(\\phi)\\right]$ at $\\phi=\\phi_0$. The presence\nof such a localised correction term at $\\phi_0$ leads to a large peak in the\ncurvature power spectrum and to an enhanced probability of black hole\nformation. Remarkably this does not significantly affect the scalar spectral\nindex $n_{_S}$ and tensor to scalar ratio $r$ on CMB scales. Consequently such\nmodels can produce higher mass primordial black holes ($M_{\\rm PBH}\\geq 1\nM_{\\odot}$) in contrast to models with `near inflection-point potentials' in\nwhich generating higher mass black holes severely affects $n_{_S}$ and $r$.\nWith a suitable choice of the base potential - such as the string theory based\n(KKLT) inflation or the $\\alpha$-attractor models - the amplification of\nprimordial scalar power spectrum can be as large as $10^7$ which leads to a\nsignificant contribution of primordial black holes (PBHs) to the dark matter\ndensity today, $f_{\\rm PBH} = \\Omega_{0,\\rm PBH}/\\Omega_{0,\\rm DM} \\sim O(1)$.\nInterestingly, our results remain valid if the bump is replaced by a dip. In\nthis case the base inflaton potential $V_b(\\phi)$ contains a negative local\ncorrection term such as $V_b(\\phi)\\left[1-\\varepsilon(\\phi)\\right]$ at\n$\\phi=\\phi_0$ which leads to an enhanced probability of PBH formation.

All\nexisting studies consider the social network to be static and neglect its\ninherent dynamics. In fact, the dynamics of social networks contain the\ndiscriminative pattern of an individual, which can be leveraged to facilitate\nsocial network alignment. Hence, we for the first time propose to study the\nproblem of aligning dynamic social networks. Towards this end, we propose a\nnovel Dynamic social Network Alignment (DNA) framework, a unified optimization\napproach over deep neural architectures, to unfold the fruitful dynamics to\nperform alignment. However, it faces tremendous challenges in both modeling and\noptimization: (1) To model the intra-network dynamics, we explore the local\ndynamics of the latent pattern in friending evolvement and the global\nconsistency of the representation similarity with neighbors. We design a novel\ndeep neural architecture to obtain the dual embedding capturing local dynamics\nand global consistency for each user. (2) To model the inter-network alignment,\nwe exploit the underlying identity of an individual from the dual embedding in\neach dynamic social network. We design a unified optimization approach\ninterplaying proposed deep neural architectures to construct a common subspace\nof identity embeddings. (3) To address this optimization problem, we design an\neffective alternating algorithm with solid theoretical guarantees.We conduct\nextensive experiments on real-world datasets and show that the proposed DNA\nframework substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 19:26:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-04"}

Whereas numerous studies have\ndeveloped these principles independently, here, we combine them, building on\nthe assumption of a class-conditional noise process to directly estimate the\njoint distribution between noisy (given) labels and uncorrupted (unknown)\nlabels. This results in a generalized CL which is provably consistent and\nexperimentally performant. We present sufficient conditions where CL exactly\nfinds label errors, and show CL performance exceeding seven recent competitive\napproaches for learning with noisy labels on the CIFAR dataset. Uniquely, the\nCL framework is not coupled to a specific data modality or model (e.g., we use\nCL to find several label errors in the presumed error-free MNIST dataset and\nimprove sentiment classification on text data in Amazon Reviews).

Regression models of such data allow for the\nestimation of effects of exogenous covariates on the network and for prediction\nof unobserved data. Ideally, estimators of the regression parameters should\naccount for the inherent dependencies among relations in the network that\ninvolve the same actor. To account for such dependencies, researchers have\ndeveloped a host of latent variable network models, however, estimation of many\nlatent variable network models is computationally onerous and which model is\nbest to base inference upon may not be clear.

From post-processing the atmospheric flows at various\nresolutions (assuming a cloud-free situation), we show that the stronger flow\nvariability achieved at high resolution does not translate into noticeably\nstronger dayside infrared flux variability.

For this purpose, we construct an $m$-dimensional Beta distribution\nfrom a $2^m$-dimensional Dirichlet distribution, building on work by Olkin and\nTrikalinos (2015).

For higher dimensions ($m > 10$), the extensive\nmodel based on $2^m$ parameters starts to become numerically infeasible. To\ncounter this problem, we utilize a reduced parametrisation which has only $1 +\nm(m + 1)/2$ parameters describing first and second order moments.

This phenomenon has been named classicalization and is characterized by\na length scale called classicalization radius $r_*$ which increases with\nenergy. It has been argued that scalar field theories with derivative\nself-interactions are likely candidate for UV-completetion by classicalization\nand are much likely to form classicalons compared to non-classicalizing\ntheories like $\\phi^4$ scalar field theory. To look further into this claim, in\nthis paper 2 to N particle scattering amplitude, scattering cross-section and\nthe amplitude of classical structure formation has been calculated and compared\nfor a classicalizing and non-classicalizing theory. As the phenomenon of\nclassicalization relies on creating a large number of low energy particles from\nhigh energy two particle scattering, the ratios between the scattering\namplitudes and the amplitude of classical structure formation in these two\ncases are an indicator of the feasibility of the classicalization process.

Jao et al., High Energy Density Physics 32,\n31-43 (2019) and Y. Chen et al., Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res., Sect. A\n903, 119 (2018)]. In this note, an upgraded accelerator beamline design is\nproposed based on a feasible experimental setup in a realistic laboratory\nenvironment. The improved design aims to provide milliampere (mA)\nmega-electron-volt (MeV) quasi-continuous (cw) electron beams for\nplasma-astrophysical applications. Such a design utilizes a so-called\nmixed-guiding-field magnetic system right after the cut disk structure (CDS)\nbooster cavity to provide a periodic longitudinal focusing field. The\ntransportation of the produced cw beam with large energy spread to the plasma\ncell location is improved. The magnetic field serves as well as a seeding field\nin the plasma environment for the growth of electromagnetic instabilities. In\nconjunction with the appliance of a circular collimator at the exit of the CDS,\nthe new design allows production of quasi-cw beams with a three orders higher\nnumber density at the entrance of the plasma cell compared to the previous\ndesign for a seeding magnetic field of about 50 mT while the locally enhanced\nelectric field at the cathode is up to 8 GV/m.

To investigate how close the quality of\nsynthesized rakugo speech can approach that of professionals' speech, we\nmodeled rakugo speech using Tacotron 2, a state-of-the-art speech synthesis\nsystem that can produce speech that sounds as natural as human speech albeit\nunder limited conditions, and an enhanced version of it with self-attention to\nbetter consider long-term dependencies.

Also, the\napproaches adopted in the literature for the designing of the\ncombiner'/precoder' analog parts do not try to avoid or even reduce the inter\nuser/symbol interference, they concentrate on increasing the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR). We propose a simple solution that decreases the interference while\nmaintaining large SNR. In addition, one of the proposed hybrid combiners\nreaches the maximum value of our objective function according with the\nHadamard's inequality. Numerical results illustrate the BER performance\nimprovements resulting from our proposals. In addition, a simple detection\napproach can be used for data estimation without significant performance loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 23:58:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-04"}

Previous attempts to reason about or identify weird machines have\nviewed these models through the lens of formal computational structures such as\nstate machines and Turing machines. But because programmers rarely think about\nprograms in this way, it is difficult to effectively apply insights about weird\nmachines to improve security.\n  We present a new view of weird machines based on techniques from programming\nlanguages theory and secure compilation. Instead of an underspecified model\ndrawn from a programmers' head, we start with a program written in a high-level\nsource language that enforces security properties by design. Instead of state\nmachines to describe computation, we use the well-defined semantics of this\nsource language and a target language, into which the source program will be\ncompiled. Weird machines are the sets of behaviors that can be achieved by a\ncompiled source program in the target language that cannot be achieved in the\nsource language directly. That is, exploits are witnesses to insecure\ncompilation.\n  This paper develops a framework for characterizing weird machines as insecure\ncompilation, and illustrates the framework with examples of common exploits. We\nstudy the classes of security properties that exploits violate, the\ncompositionality of exploits in a compiler stack, and the weird machines and\nmitigations that arise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 00:17:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-04"}

To fully exploit the capabilities\nof such devices, it is necessary to understand the underlying biological\nfeatures of SSVEPs and design the system considering their inherent\ncharacteristics. This paper introduces bio-inspired filter banks (BIFBs) for\nimproved SSVEP frequency recognition. SSVEPs are frequency selective,\nsubject-specific, and their power gets weaker as the frequency of the visual\nstimuli increases. Therefore, the gain and bandwidth of the filters are\ndesigned and tuned based on these characteristics while also incorporating\nharmonic SSVEP responses. The BIFBs are utilized in the feature extraction\nstage to increase the separability of classes. This method not only improves\nthe recognition accuracy but also increases the total number of available\ncommands in a BCI system by allowing the use of stimuli frequencies that elicit\nweak SSVEP responses. The BIFBs are promising particularly in the\nhigh-frequency band, which causes less visual fatigue. Hence, the proposed\napproach might enhance user comfort as well.

A path to understanding the\nhierarchy problem of gravity consists in adding an extra dimension to\nEinstein-Hilbert's general relativity. Therefore, gravity would be the only\nforce leaking through this region of spacetime also known as brane. Despite the\nsuccess of the mathematical description for the hierarchy issue through simple\nthin branes, it is also possible to derive a consistent theory of gravity using\nthick branes. The present work unveils a new procedure to determine analytic\nhybrid thick braneworld models. The discussions were based on the so-called\nBloch branes, which are constructed via a two-field model coupled with gravity\nin 5-dimensional spacetime. Both fields used to build the Bloch branes depend\nonly on the extra dimension, and the hybrid branes present internal structure,\ncharacterizing them as thick. In this work, we were able to derive new analytic\nthick brane models by using the extension method. Some of these new branes\npresent a Minkowski spacetime immersed inside of the fifth-dimension. We showed\nhow the symmetry of the emergent branes can be controlled via specific\nparameters. We also analyzed the stability conditions for each braneworld\nfamily, showing possible stable states for gravitons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 03:17:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 14:25:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-25"}

The key idea of RSP is to\nreplace the survival probability of a censored failure time with a uniform\nrandom number between 0 and the survival probability of the censored time. We\nprove that RSPs always have the uniform distribution on $(0,1)$ under the true\nmodel with the true generating parameters. Therefore, we can transform RSPs\ninto normally-distributed residuals with the normal quantile function. We call\nsuch residuals by normalized RSP (NRSP residuals).

Our simulation studies show that, although the\nGOF tests with NRSP residuals are not as powerful as a traditional GOF test\nmethod, a non-linear test based on NRSP residuals has significantly higher\npower in detecting non-linearity.

The universal\nconstants in the model of $S_T$ characterize the enhancement of area growth of\npremixed flames by turbulence, and they are determined by Lagrangian statistics\nof propagating surfaces. The flame area is then modelled by the area of\npropagating surfaces at a truncation time.

First, we\nprove that the NbAFL can satisfy DP under distinct protection levels by\nproperly adapting different variances of artificial noises. Then we develop a\ntheoretical convergence bound of the loss function of the trained FL model in\nthe NbAFL. Specifically, the theoretical bound reveals the following three key\nproperties: 1) There is a tradeoff between the convergence performance and\nprivacy protection levels, i.e., a better convergence performance leads to a\nlower protection level; 2) Given a fixed privacy protection level, increasing\nthe number $N$ of overall clients participating in FL can improve the\nconvergence performance; 3) There is an optimal number of maximum aggregation\ntimes (communication rounds) in terms of convergence performance for a given\nprotection level. Furthermore, we propose a $K$-random scheduling strategy,\nwhere $K$ ($1<K<N$) clients are randomly selected from the $N$ overall clients\nto participate in each aggregation. We also develop the corresponding\nconvergence bound of the loss function in this case and the $K$-random\nscheduling strategy can also retain the above three properties.

We use a human judgment evaluation on a testbed task to\ncompare our approach to variants in terms of intelligibility, mental model and\nperceived trust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 06:53:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-04"}

However, this method has a\nproblem of liberality caused by breaking the marginal spatial correlation\nstructure due to the toroidal correction. This indeed causes that the\nassumption of exchangability, which is essential for the Monte Carlo test to be\nexact, is not fulfilled.\n  We present a number of permutation strategies and show that the random shift\nwith the variance correction brings a suitable improvement compared to the\ntorus correction in the random field case. It reduces the liberality and\nachieves the largest power from all investigated variants. To obtain the\nvariance for the variance correction method, several approaches were studied.\nThe best results were achieved, for the sample covariance as the test\nstatistics, with the correction factor $1/n$. This corresponds to the\nasymptotic order of the variance of the test statistics.\n  In the point process case, the problem of deviations from exchangeability is\nfar more complex and we propose an alternative strategy based on the mean cross\nnearest-neighbor distance and torus correction. It reduces the liberality but\nachieves slightly lower power than the usual cross $K$-function.

Especially fingerprints are widely used nowadays due to the\navailability and low cost of fingerprint scanners. To avoid identity theft or\nimpersonation, fingerprint data is typically stored locally, e.g., in a trusted\nhardware module, in a single device that is used for user enrollment and\nauthentication. Local storage, however, limits the ability to implement\ndistributed applications, in which users can enroll their fingerprint once and\nuse it to access multiple physical locations and mobile applications\nafterwards.\n  In this paper, we present a distributed authentication system that stores\nfingerprint data in a server or cloud infrastructure in a privacy-preserving\nway.

Nevertheless, it is impractical to achieve a\nperfect acquisition of the local models in wireless communication due to noise,\nwhich also brings serious effects on federated learning. To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose a robust design for federated learning to alleviate the\neffects of noise in this paper. Considering noise in the two aforementioned\nsteps, we first formulate the training problem as a parallel optimization for\neach node under the expectation-based model and the worst-case model. Due to\nthe non-convexity of the problem, a regularization for the loss function\napproximation method is proposed to make it tractable. Regarding the worst-case\nmodel, we develop a feasible training scheme which utilizes the sampling-based\nsuccessive convex approximation algorithm to tackle the unavailable maxima or\nminima noise condition and the non-convex issue of the objective function.\nFurthermore, the convergence rates of both new designs are analyzed from a\ntheoretical point of view.

The system is based on\nwhitelisting, as in the Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) framework,\nimplemented as a VNF. Unlike common MUD suggestions that place the whitelist\napplication at the home/enterprise network, our approach is to place the\nenforcement upstream at the provider network, combining an NFV (Network\nFunction Virtualization) with router/switching filtering capabilities, e.g.,\nACLs. The VNF monitors many home networks simultaneously, and therefore, is a\nhighly-scalable managed service solution that provides both the end customers\nand the ISP with excellent visibility and security of the IoT devices at the\ncustomer premises.\n  The system includes a mechanism to distinguish between flows of different\ndevices at the ISP level despite the fact that most home networks (and their\nIoT devices) are behind a NAT and all the flows from the same home come out\nwith the same source IP address. Moreover, the NFV system needs to receive only\nthe first packet of each connection at the VNF, and rules space is proportional\nto the number of unique types of IoT devices rather than the number of IoT\ndevices. The monitoring part of the solution is off the critical path and can\nalso uniquely protect from incoming DDoS attacks.\n  To cope with internal traffic, that is not visible outside the customer\npremise and often consists of P2P communication, we suggest a hybrid approach,\nwhere we deploy a lightweight component at the CPE, whose sole purpose is to\nmonitor P2P communication.

In the precursor\nphase, three-dimensional tether-cutting reconnection at the HFT is most likely\nresulting in the heating and buildup of the hot channel. In this process, the\nforming hot channel was rapidly enlarged at its spatial size and slipped its\nfeet to two remote positions.

As MFR's west footpoints gradually drifted to a new position, a set of\nnewborn atypical flare loops connected into the west core dimming, causing a\nrapid decrease of dimmed area inside this core dimming and also generating a\nsecondary flare ribbon at their remote feet.

However, a major issue\nhinders the practical usage of those mechanisms: they require the participants\nto perform an infinite number of tasks. When the participants perform a finite\nnumber of tasks, these mechanisms only achieve approximated dominant\ntruthfulness. The existence of a dominantly truthful multi-task peer prediction\nmechanism that only requires a finite number of tasks remains to be an open\nquestion that may have a negative result, even with full prior knowledge.\n  This paper answers this open question by proposing a new mechanism,\nDeterminant based Mutual Information Mechanism (DMI-Mechanism), that is\ndominantly truthful when the number of tasks is at least 2C and the number of\nparticipants is at least 2. C is the number of choices for each question (C=2\nfor binary-choice questions). In addition to incentivizing honest reports,\nDMI-Mechanism can also be transferred into an information evaluation rule that\nidentifies high-quality information without verification when there are at\nleast 3 participants.

Planets formed via giant impacts have highly eccentric orbits. A\nswarm of planetesimals around the planets may lead to eccentricity damping for\nthe planets via the equipartition of random energies (dynamical friction).\nHowever, dynamical friction increases eccentricities of planetesimals,\nresulting in high velocity collisions between planetesimals. The collisional\ncascade grinds planetesimals to dust until dust grains are blown out due to\nradiation pressure. Therefore, the total mass of planetesimals decreases due to\ncollisional fragmentation, which weakens dynamical friction. We investigate the\norbital evolution of protoplanets in a planetesimal disk, taking into account\ncollisional fragmentation of planetesimals.

On the other hand, giant impacts\neject collisional fragments. Although the total mass of giant impact ejecta is\n0.1-0.3 Earth masses, the largest impact ejecta are ~ 1,000 km in size. We also\ninvestigate the orbital evolution of single planets with initial eccentricities\n0.1 in a swarm of such giant impact ejecta. Although the total mass of giant\nimpact ejecta decreases by a factor of 3 in 30 Myrs, eccentricities of planets\nare damped down to the Earth level (~0.01) due to interaction with giant impact\nejecta. Therefore, giant impact ejecta play an important role for determination\nof terrestrial planet orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 09:43:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 01:50:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 08:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Moreover, Jones et al.\\ initiated the study of\n12-representability of induced subgraphs of a grid graph, and asked whether it\nis possible to characterize such graphs. This question in is meant to be about\ninduced subgraphs of a grid graph that consist of squares, which we call square\ngrid graphs.

The\naim of this study was to investigate how well a DL model performs in unseen\nclinical data sets---collected with different scanners, protocols and disease\npopulations---and whether more heterogeneous training data improves\ngeneralization. In total, 3117 MRI scans of brains from multiple dementia\nresearch cohorts and memory clinics, that had been visually rated by a\nneuroradiologist according to Scheltens' scale of medial temporal atrophy\n(MTA), were included in this study. By training multiple versions of a\nconvolutional neural network on different subsets of this data to predict MTA\nratings, we assessed the impact of including images from a wider distribution\nduring training had on performance in external memory clinic data.

The effectiveness and preciseness of the traditional survey-based and\nsmart card data-driven method for O-D information inference have multiple\ndisadvantages due to the insufficient sample, the high time and energy cost,\nand the lack of inferring results validation. By considering the ubiquity of\nsmart mobile devices in the world, several methods were developed for\nestimating the transit ridership flow from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth sensing data by\nfiltering out the non-passenger MAC addresses based on the predefined\nthresholds. However, the accuracy of the filtering methods is still\nquestionable for the indeterminate threshold values and the lack of\nquantitative results validation. By combining the consideration of the assumed\noverlapped feature space of passenger and non-passenger with the above\nconcerns, a three steps data-driven method for estimating transit ridership\nflow and O-D information from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth sensing data is proposed in\nthis paper. The observed ridership flow is used as ground truth for calculating\nthe performance measurements.

Similarly, numerous small terrestrial animals move through\ncluttered terrain where 3-D, multi-component obstacles like grass, shrubs,\nvines, and leaf litter resist motion, but it is unknown whether their body\nshape plays a major role in traversal. Few ground vehicles or terrestrial\nrobots have used body shape to effectively traverse cluttered terrain. Here, we\nchallenged forest-floor-dwelling discoid cockroaches possessing a thin, rounded\nbody to traverse tall, narrowly spaced, vertical, grass-like compliant beams.\nAnimals displayed high traversal performance (79 +/- 12% probability and 3.4\n+/- 0.7 s time). Although we observed diverse traversal strategies, cockroaches\nprimarily (48 +/- 9 % probability) used a novel roll maneuver, allowing them to\nrapidly traverse obstacle gaps narrower than half body width (2.0 +/- 0.5 s\ntraversal time). Reduction of body roundness by addition of artificial shells\nnearly inhibited roll maneuvers and decreased traversal performance. Inspired\nby this discovery, we added a thin, rounded exoskeletal shell to a legged robot\nwith a nearly cuboidal body, common to many existing terrestrial robots.\nWithout adding sensory feedback or changing the open-loop control, the rounded\nshell enabled the robot to traverse beam obstacles with gaps narrower than\nshell width via body roll. Terradynamically streamlined shapes can reduce\nterrain resistance and enhance traversability by assisting effective body\nreorientation via distributed mechanical feedback. Our findings highlight the\nneed to consider body shape to improve robot mobility in real-world terrain\noften filled with clutter, and to develop better locomotor-ground contact\nmodels to understand interaction with complex terrain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 15:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

In this age\nof heterogeneous systems that integrate different technologies for development\nof an optimized solution to a specific real world problem, big data systems are\nnot an exception to any such rule. As far as the storage aspect of any big data\nsystem is concerned, the primary facet in this regard is a storage\ninfrastructure and NoSQL is the right technology that fulfills its\nrequirements. However, every big data application has variable data\ncharacteristics and thus, the corresponding data fits into a different data\nmodel. Moreover, the requirements of different applications vary on the basis\nof budget and functionality. This paper presents a feature analysis of 80 NoSQL\nsolutions, elaborating on the criteria and points that a developer must\nconsider while making a possible choice. Bivariate analysis of dataset created\nfor the identified NoSQL solutions was performed to establish relationship\nbetween 9 features. Furthermore, cluster analysis of the dataset was used to\ncreate categories of solutions to present a statistically supported\nclassification scheme. Finally, applications for different solutions were\nreviewed and classified under domain-specific categories. Random forest\nclassification was used to determine the most relevant features for\napplications and correspondingly a decision tree-based prediction model was\nproposed, implemented and deployed in the form of a web application to\ndetermine the suitability of a NoSQL solution for an application area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 07:16:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

For chip-based photodetectors, layered two-dimensional (2D)\nmaterials bear scientific and technologically-relevant properties leading to\nstrong light-matter-interaction devices due to effects such as reduced coulomb\nscreening or excitonic states. However, no efficient photodetector in the\ntelecommunication C-band using 2D materials has been realized yet.

Unlike Graphene-based photodetectors\nrelying on a gapless band structure, this semiconductor-2D material detector\nshows a ~100X improved dark current enabling an efficient noise-equivalent\npower of just 90 pW/Hz^0.5.
