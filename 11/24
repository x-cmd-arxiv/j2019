However, some sources have\nlower entropy compared to the error itself, formally called \"more error than\nentropy\", a standard secure sketch cannot show its security promise perfectly\nto these kind of sources.

In SM, only one transmitter is active\nat any given time while the rest of them remain silent. The index of the active\ntransmitter carries information. This spatial information is in addition to the\ndata carried by the constellation symbols in the signal domain. Therefore, SM\nincreases the transmission rate of the communication system compared to\nsingle-input-single-output and space-time block coding (STBC)-MIMO. For signal\ndomain data encoding, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has\nbeen widely adopted. The key benefits in multi-carrier intensity-modulation and\ndirect-detection (IM/DD) systems are: i) the capability to achieve high\nspectral efficiency and ii) the ability to effectively mitigate direct-current\n(DC) wander effects and the impact of ambient light. However, current off-the\nshelf light emitting diodes (LEDs) which are used as transmit entities are\nprimarily bandwidth limited. Thus, there are benefits of combining SM and OFDM\nto enhance transmission speeds while maintaining low complexity. In this paper,\nthe two most common OFDM-based SM types, namely frequency domain SM (FD-SM) and\ntime domain SM (TD-SM), are investigated for optical wireless communications\n(OWC). Moreover, proof-ofconcept experimental results are presented to showcase\npractical feasibility of both techniques. The obtained results are also\ncompared with Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that TDSM with an\noptimal maximum-a-posteriori-probability (MAP) detector significantly\noutperforms FD-SM. It can be inferred from the results that TD SM is a strong\ncandidate among OFDM-based optical SM systems for future optical IM/DD wireless\ncommunication systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2019 16:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

A widely applicable\nnotion of classicality of this sort is whether or not the predictions of a\ngiven operational theory can be explained by a generalized-noncontextual\nontological model. We here explore what notion of classicality this implies for\nthe generalized probabilistic theory (GPT) that arises from a given operational\ntheory, focusing on prepare-measure scenarios. We first show that, when mapping\nan operational theory to a GPT by quotienting relative to operational\nequivalences, the constraint of explainability by a generalized-noncontextual\nontological model is mapped to the constraint of explainability by an\nontological model. We then show that, under the additional assumption that the\nontic state space is of finite cardinality, this constraint on the GPT can be\nexpressed as a geometric condition which we term simplex-embeddability. Whereas\nthe traditional notion of classicality for a GPT is that its state space be a\nsimplex and its effect space be the dual of this simplex, simplex-embeddability\nmerely requires that its state space be embeddable in a simplex and its effect\nspace in the dual of that simplex. We argue that simplex-embeddability\nconstitutes an intuitive and freestanding notion of classicality for GPTs. Our\nresult also has applications to witnessing nonclassicality in prepare-measure\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2019 16:41:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 03:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

However, the damaged layer of implanted samples is only\nfew microns thick, making it difficult to estimate macroscopic properties. Here\nwe address this challenge using a combination of experimental and modelling\ntechniques. We concentrate on self-ion-implanted tungsten, the front-runner for\nfusion armour components and a prototypical bcc material. To capture\ndose-dependent evolution of properties, we experimentally characterise samples\nwith damage levels from 0.01 to 1 dpa. Spherical nano-indentation of <001>\ngrains shows hardness increasing up to a dose of 0.032 dpa, beyond which it\nsaturates. AFM measurements show pile-up increasing up to the same dose, beyond\nwhich large pile-up and slip-steps are seen. Based on the observations we\ndevelop a crystal plasticity (CPFE) model for the irradiated material. It\ncaptures irradiation-induced hardening followed by strain-softening through\ninteraction of irradiation-defects and gliding dislocations. Shear resistance\nof irradiation-defects is derived from TEM observations of similarly irradiated\nsamples. Nano-indentation of pristine and implanted tungsten of doses 0.01,\n0.1, 0.32 and 1 dpa is simulated. Two model parameters are fitted to the\nexperimental results of the 0.01 dpa sample and are kept unchanged for all\nother doses. Peak load, indent surface profiles and damage saturation predicted\nby the CPFE model closely match experimental observations. Predicted lattice\ndistortions and dislocation distributions around indents agree with\ncorresponding measurements from HR-EBSD. Finally, the CPFE model is used to\npredict the macroscopic stress-strain response of similarly irradiated bulk\ntungsten material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2019 18:08:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 21:24:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Several approaches use videos to represent\nvisions. However, these approaches omit how to produce a good video. This\nmissing guidance is one crucial reason why videos are not established in RE. We\npropose a quality model for videos representing a vision, so-called vision\nvideos. Based on two literature reviews, we elaborate ten quality\ncharacteristics of videos and five quality characteristics of visions which\ntogether form a quality model for vision videos that includes all 15 quality\ncharacteristics. We provide two representations of the quality model: (a) A\nhierarchical decomposition of vision video quality into the quality\ncharacteristics and (b) A mapping of these characteristics to the video\nproduction and use process. While the hierarchical decomposition supports the\nevaluation of vision videos, the mapping provides guidance for video\nproduction. In an evaluation with 139 students, we investigated whether the 15\ncharacteristics are related to the overall quality of vision videos perceived\nby the subjects from a developer's the point of view. Six characteristics\n(video length, focus, prior knowledge, clarity, pleasure, and stability)\ncorrelated significantly with the likelihood that the subjects perceived a\nvision video as good. These relationships substantiate a fundamental relevance\nof the proposed quality model. Therefore, we conclude that the quality model is\na sound basis for future refinements and extensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2019 18:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

There is significant utility in understanding their mechanisms to\nclassify point clouds, which can potentially help diagnosing these networks and\ndesigning better architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to\nvisualize features important to the point cloud classifiers. Our approach is\nbased on smoothing curved areas on a point cloud. After prominent features were\nsmoothed, the resulting point cloud can be evaluated on the network to assess\nwhether the feature is important to the classifier. A technical contribution of\nthe paper is an approximated curvature smoothing algorithm, which can smoothly\ntransition from the original point cloud to one of constant curvature, such as\na uniform sphere. Based on the smoothing algorithm, we propose PCI-GOS (Point\nCloud Integrated-Gradients Optimized Saliency), a visualization technique that\ncan automatically find the minimal saliency map that covers the most important\nfeatures on a shape.

To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first study to use learning-based registration\nmethods for the segmentation of head and neck patients and demonstrate its\nutility in clinical applications. Methods: Our algorithm cascades rigid and\ndeformable deformation blocks, and takes on an atlas image (M), set of\natlas-space segmentations (S_A), and a patient image (F) as inputs, while\noutputting patient-space segmentations of all OARs defined on the atlas. We\ntrain our model on 475 CT images taken from public archives and Stanford RadOnc\nClinic (SROC), validate on 5 CT images from SROC, and test our model on 20 CT\nimages from SROC. Results: Our method outperforms current state of the art\nlearning-based registration algorithms and achieves an overall dice score of\n0.789 on our test set. Moreover, our method yields a performance comparable to\nmanual segmentation and supervised segmentation, while solving a much more\ncomplex registration problem. Whereas supervised segmentation methods only\nautomate the segmentation process for a select few number of OARs, we\ndemonstrate that our methods can achieve similar performance for OARs of\ninterest, while also providing segmentations for every other OAR on the\nprovided atlas. Conclusions: Our proposed algorithm has significant clinical\napplications and could help reduce the bottleneck for segmentation of head and\nneck OARs. Further, our results demonstrate that semi-supervised diffeomorphic\nregistration can be accurately applied to both registration and segmentation\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2019 21:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

The design of robust engineering structures,\ntherefore, needs to incorporate uncertainty in the optimization process.\nStochastic gradient descent (SGD) method can alleviate the cost of optimization\nunder uncertainty, which includes statistical moments of quantities of interest\nin the objective and constraints. However, the design may change considerably\nduring the initial iterations of the optimization process which impedes the\nconvergence of the traditional SGD method and its variants. In this paper, we\npresent two SGD based algorithms, where the computational cost is reduced by\nemploying a low-fidelity model in the optimization process. In the first\nalgorithm, most of the stochastic gradient calculations are performed on the\nlow-fidelity model and only a handful of gradients from the high-fidelity model\nare used per iteration, resulting in an improved convergence. In the second\nalgorithm, we use gradients from low-fidelity models to be used as control\nvariate, a variance reduction technique, to reduce the variance in the search\ndirection. These two bi-fidelity algorithms are illustrated first with a\nconceptual example. Then, the convergence of the proposed bi-fidelity\nalgorithms is studied with two numerical examples of shape and topology\noptimization and compared to popular variants of the SGD method that do not use\nlow-fidelity models. The results show that the proposed use of a bi-fidelity\napproach for the SGD method can improve the convergence. Two analytical proofs\nare also provided that show the linear convergence of these two algorithms\nunder appropriate assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2019 21:32:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

This work\ncontrasts the power of the CF in the maximal- and average-error cases, showing\nthat a constant number of bits communicated over the CF output link can yield a\npositive gain in the maximal-error sum-capacity, while a far greater number of\nbits, even numbers that grow sublinearly in the blocklength, can never yield a\nnon-negligible gain in the average-error sum-capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2019 02:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

However,\nwriting a correct smart contract is notoriously difficult. Moreover, once a\nstate-changing transaction is confirmed by the network, the result is\nimmutable. For this reason, it is crucial to perform a thorough testing of a\nsmart contract application before its deployment. This paper's focus is on the\ntest coverage criteria for smart contracts, which are objective rules that\nmeasure test quality. We analyze the unique characteristics of the Ethereum\nsmart contract program model as compared to the conventional program model. To\ncapture essential control flow behaviors of smart contracts, we propose the\nnotions of whole transaction basis path set and bounded transaction\ninteraction. The former is a limited set of linearly independent\ninter-procedural paths from which the potentially infinite paths of Ethereum\ntransactions can be constructed by linear combination, while the latter is the\npermutations of transactions within a certain bound. Based on these two\nnotions, we define a family of path-based test coverage criteria. Algorithms\nare given to the generation of coverage requirements.

In this paper, we propose\nContractGuard, the first intrusion detection system (IDS) to defend Ethereum\nsmart contracts against such attacks. Like IDSs for conventional programs,\nContractGuard detects intrusion attempts as abnormal control flow. However,\nexisting IDS techniques/tools are inapplicable to Ethereum smart contracts due\nto Ethereum's decentralized nature and its highly restrictive execution\nenvironment. To address these issues, we design ContractGuard by embedding it\nin the contracts to profile context-tagged acyclic paths, and optimizing it\nunder the Ethereum gas-oriented performance model.

In particular, we show that if $M=(S,{\\cal\nI})$ is a matroid in which $S$ can be partitioned into $k$ independent sets,\nthen there exists a partition matroid $N=(S,{\\cal J})$ with ${\\cal\nJ}\\subseteq{\\cal I}$ in which $S$ can be partitioned into (A) $k$ independent\nsets if $M$ is a transversal matroid, (B) $2k-1$ independent sets if $M$ is a\ngraphic matroid, (C) $\\lceil kr/(r-1)\\rceil$ independent sets if $M$ is a\npaving matroid of rank $r$, and (D) $2k-2$ independent sets if $M$ is a\ngammoid. We extend our results by showing that the existence of a matroid $N$\nwith $\\chi(N)\\leq 2\\chi(M)$ implies the existence of a matroid $N'$ with\n$\\chi(N')\\leq 2\\chi(M')$ for every truncation $M'$ of $M$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2019 09:38:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 01:22:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}

We first propose a new leader-based-view (LBV)\nabstraction that encapsulates the core properties provided by each view in a\npartially synchronous consensus algorithm, designed according to the\nleader-based view-by-view paradigm (e.g., PBFT and Paxos). Then, we compose\nseveral LBV instances in a non-trivial way in order to boost asynchronous\nliveness of existing SMR solutions.\n  ACE is model agnostic - it abstracts away any model assumptions that\nconsensus protocols may have, e.g., the ratio and types of faulty parties. For\nexample, when the LBV abstraction is instantiated with a partially synchronous\nconsensus algorithm designed to tolerate crash failures, e.g., Paxos or Raft,\nACE yields an asynchronous SMR for $n = 2f+1$ parties. However, if the LBV\nabstraction is instantiated with a byzantine protocol like PBFT or HotStuff,\nthen ACE yields an asynchronous byzantine SMR for $n = 3f+1$ parties.\n  To demonstrate the power of ACE, we implement it in C++, instantiate the LBV\nabstraction with a view implementation of HotStuff -- a state of the art\npartially synchronous byzantine agreement protocol -- and compare it with the\nbase HotStuff implementation under different adversarial scenarios. Our\nevaluation shows that while ACE is outperformed by HotStuff in the optimistic,\nsynchronous, failure-free case, ACE has absolute superiority during network\nasynchrony and attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2019 09:47:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

On the\nother hand, there is a dual mapping between classical spin models and quantum\nCalderbank-Shor-Stean (CSS) states where the partition function of a classical\nmodel defined on a hypergraph $H$ is written as an inner product of a product\nstate and a CSS state on dual hypergraph $\\tilde{H}$. It is then interesting to\nsee what is the interpretation of the classical phase transition in the random\nbond Ising model within the framework of the above duality and whether such an\ninterpretation has any connection to the error threshold of the corresponding\ntopological CSS code. In this paper, we consider the above duality relation\nspecifically for a two-dimensional random bond Ising model. We show that the\norder parameter of this classical system is mapped to a coherence order\nparameter in a noisy Toric code model. In particular, a quantum phase\ntransition from a coherent phase to a non-coherent phase occurs when the\ninitial coherent state is affected by two sequences of bit-flip quantum\nchannels where a quenched disorder is induced by measurement of the errors\nafter the first channel. On the other hand, the above transition is directly\nrelated to error threshold of the Toric code model. Accordingly, and since the\nnoisy process can be applied to other topological CSS states, we conclude that\nthe dual correspondence can also provide a useful tool for the study of error\nthresholds in different topological CSS codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2019 10:26:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

In this paper, we study the robust and\nadaptive maximum flow problem in an uncertain environment where the network\nparameters (e.g., capacities) are known and deterministic, but the network\nstructure (e.g., edges) is vulnerable to adversarial attacks or failures. We\npropose a robust and sustainable network flow model to effectively and\nproactively counter plausible attacking behaviors of an adversary operating\nunder a budget constraint. Specifically, we introduce a novel scenario\ngeneration approach based on an iterative two-player game between a defender\nand an adversary. We assume that the adversary always takes a best myopic\nresponse (out of some feasible attacks) against the current flow scenario\nprepared by the defender. On the other hand, we assume that the defender\nconsiders all the attacking behaviors revealed by the adversary in previous\niterations in order to generate a new conservative flow strategy that is robust\n(maximin) against all those attacks. This iterative game continues until the\nobjectives of the adversary and the administrator both converge. We show that\nthe robust network flow problem to be solved by the defender is NP-hard and\nthat the complexity of the adversary's decision problem grows exponentially\nwith the network size and the adversary's budget value. We propose two\nprincipled heuristic approaches for solving the adversary's problem at the\nscale of a large urban network. Extensive computational results on multiple\nsynthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that the solution provided by\nthe defender's problem significantly increases the amount of flow pushed\nthrough the network and reduces the expected lost flow over four\nstate-of-the-art benchmark approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2019 11:31:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 05:48:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 12:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

However, due to inherent challenges in the training\nobjective, VAEs fail to learn useful representations amenable for downstream\ntasks. Regularization-based methods that attempt to improve the representation\nlearning aspect of VAEs come at a price: poor sample generation. In this paper,\nwe explore this representation-generation trade-off for regularized VAEs and\nintroduce a new family of priors, namely decoupled priors, or dpVAEs, that\ndecouple the representation space from the generation space. This decoupling\nenables the use of VAE regularizers on the representation space without\nimpacting the distribution used for sample generation, and thereby reaping the\nrepresentation learning benefits of the regularizations without sacrificing the\nsample generation. dpVAE leverages invertible networks to learn a bijective\nmapping from an arbitrarily complex representation distribution to a simple,\ntractable, generative distribution.

The generator of our EDIT comprises of a part of blocks configured\nby shared parameters, and the rest by varied parameters exported by an\nexemplar-domain aware parameter network. In addition, a discriminator is\nequipped during the training phase to guarantee the output satisfying the\ndistribution of the target domain. Our EDIT can flexibly and effectively work\non multiple domains and arbitrary exemplars in a unified neat model. We conduct\nexperiments to show the efficacy of our design, and reveal its advances over\nother state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2019 12:40:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

Due to a great number of customers, e-commerce\ncompanies often employ multiple communication channels to answer customers'\nquestions, for example, chatbot and hotline. On one hand, each channel has\nlimited capacity to respond to customers' requests, on the other hand,\ncustomers have different preferences over these channels. The current\nproduction systems are mainly built based on business rules, which merely\nconsiders tradeoffs between resources and customers' satisfaction. To achieve\nthe optimal tradeoff between resources and customers' satisfaction, we propose\na new framework based on deep reinforcement learning, which directly takes both\nresources and user model into account. In addition to the framework, we also\npropose a new deep-reinforcement-learning based routing method-double dueling\ndeep Q-learning with prioritized experience replay (PER-DoDDQN).

Moreover, we also show our proposed PER-DoDDQN is\nbetter than all other deep Q-learning variants in practice, which provides a\nmore optimal routing plan.

Yet, adding\npessimism cannot always be avoided. To compute the best bound on a single\nflow's end-to-end delay thus boils down to finding the least pessimistic\ncontention models for all tandems of schedulers in the network - and an\nexhaustive search can easily become a very resource intensive task. The\nliterature proposes a promising solution to this dilemma: a heuristic making\nuse of machine learning (ML) predictions inside the NC analysis.\n  While results of this work were promising in terms of delay bound quality and\ncomputational effort, there is little to no insight on when a prediction is\nmade or if the trained algorithm can achieve similarly striking results in\nnetworks vastly differing from its training data.

A notable\napproach towards balancing this tradeoff is to merge both on-policy and\noff-policy gradient estimations. However existing PG merging methods can be\nsample inefficient and are not suitable to train deterministic policies\ndirectly. To address these issues, this paper introduces elite PGs and\nstrengthens their variance reduction effect by adopting elitism and policy\nconsolidation techniques to regularize policy training based on policy\nbehavioral knowledge extracted from elite trajectories.

To investigate the existence of such structures in\nfully developed turbulent pipe flow, stereoscopic particle image velocimetry\nmeasurements were performed in two parallel cross-sectional planes, spaced\napart by a varying distance from 0 to 9.97$R$, for $Re_\\tau = 1310$, 2430 and\n3810.\n  The instantaneous turbulence structures are sorted by width using an\nazimuthal Fourier decomposition, allowing us to create a set of average eddy\nvelocity profiles by performing an azimuthal alignment process. The resulting\neddy profiles exhibit geometric self-similar behavior in the $(r,\\theta)$-plane\nfor eddies with spanwise length scales ($\\lambda_\\theta/R$) spanning from 1.03\nto 0.175. The streamwise similarity is further investigated using two-point\ncorrelations between the two planes, where the structures exhibit a\nself-similar behaviour with length scales ($\\lambda_\\theta/R$) ranging from\napproximately $0.88$ to $0.203$. The candidate structures thereby establish\nfull three-dimensional geometrically self-similarity for structures with a\nvolumetric ratio of $1:80$. Beside the geometric similarity, the velocity\nmagnitude also exhibit self-similarity within these ranges. However, the\nvelocity scale depends on eddy size, and follow the trends based on the scaling\narguments proposed by \\cite{Perry1986}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2019 14:46:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

High-throughput methods of chromosome\nconformation capture, such as Hi-C, have revealed topologically associating\ndomains (TADs) that are defined by biased chromatin interactions within them.\n  Results: Here, we introduce a novel method, HiCKey, to decipher hierarchical\nTAD structures in Hi-C data and compare them across samples. We first derive a\ngeneralized likelihood-ratio (GLR) test for detecting change-points in an\ninteraction matrix that follows a negative binomial distribution or general\nmixture distribution. We then employ several optimal search strategies to\ndecipher hierarchical TADs with p-values calculated by the GLR test.\nLarge-scale validations of simulation data show that HiCKey has good precision\nin recalling known TADs and is robust against random collision noise of\nchromatin interactions. By applying HiCKey to Hi-C data of seven human cell\nlines, we identified multiple layers of TAD organization among them, but the\nvast majority had no more than four layers. In particular, we found that TAD\nboundaries are significantly enriched in active chromosomal regions compared to\nrepressed regions, indicating finer hierarchical architectures in active\nregions for precise gene transcription regulation.\n  Conclusions: HiCKey is optimized for processing large matrices constructed\nfrom high-resolution Hi-C experiments. The method and theoretical result of the\nGLR test provide a general framework for significance testing of similar\nexperimental chromatin interaction data that may not fully follow negative\nbinomial distributions but rather more general mixture distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2019 14:48:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 11:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

Recently, attributes have been demonstrated\nbeneficially in guiding for learning more discriminative feature\nrepresentations for Re-ID. As attributes normally co-occur in person images, it\nis desirable to model the attribute dependencies to improve the attribute\nprediction and thus Re-ID results. In this paper, we propose to model these\nattribute dependencies via a novel attribute knowledge graph (AttKG), and\npropose a novel Attribute Knowledge Graph Convolutional Network (AttKGCN) to\nsolve Re-ID problem. AttKGCN integrates both attribute prediction and Re-ID\nlearning together in a unified end-to-end framework which can boost their\nperformances, respectively. AttKGCN first builds a directed attribute KG whose\nnodes denote attributes and edges encode the co-occurrence relationships of\ndifferent attributes.

The main aim of the proposed method is to take advantage of both GS\nand bundle methods, meanwhile avoiding their drawbacks. At each iteration of\nthis method, to find an efficient descent direction, the GS technique is\nutilized for constructing a local polyhedral model for the objective function.\nIf necessary, via an iterative improvement process, this initial polyhedral\nmodel is improved by some techniques inspired by the bundle and GS methods. The\nconvergence of the method is studied, which reveals the following positive\nfeatures (i) The convergence of our method is independent of the number of\ngradient evaluations required to establish and improve the initial polyhedral\nmodels.

The core idea lies in the fact that the\nprobability of an attribute to appear in an image is far from being uniform in\nthe spatial domain. We build our attribute prediction model jointly with a deep\nsemantic segmentation network. This harnesses the localization cues learned by\nthe semantic segmentation to guide the attention of the attribute prediction to\nthe regions where different attributes naturally show up. Therefore, in\naddition to prediction, we are able to localize the attributes despite merely\nhaving access to image-level labels (weak supervision) during training. We\nfirst propose semantic segmentation-based pooling and gating, respectively\ndenoted as SSP and SSG. In the former, the estimated segmentation masks are\nused to pool the final activations of the attribute prediction network, from\nmultiple semantically homogeneous regions. In SSG, the same idea is applied to\nthe intermediate layers of the network. SSP and SSG, while effective, impose\nheavy memory utilization since each channel of the activations is pooled/gated\nwith all the semantic segmentation masks. To circumvent this, we propose\nSymbiotic Augmentation (SA), where we learn only one mask per activation\nchannel. SA allows the model to either pick one, or combine (weighted\nsuperposition) multiple semantic maps, in order to generate the proper mask for\neach channel. SA simultaneously applies the same mechanism to the reverse\nproblem by leveraging output logits of attribute prediction to guide the\nsemantic segmentation task.

Employing a mentor model\ntrained on a small portion of the labeled data and then feeding it only with\nunlabeled data, we show how to obtain a (simplified) student model that reaches\nthe same accuracy and loss as the mentor model, on the same test set, without\nusing any of the original data labels in the training of the student model. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that even on challenging classification tasks the\nstudent network architecture can be simplified significantly with a minor\ninfluence on the performance, i.e., we need not even know the original network\narchitecture of the mentor. In addition, the time required for training the\nstudent model to reach the mentor's performance level is shorter, as a result\nof a simplified architecture and more available data. The proposed method\nhighlights the disadvantages of regular supervised training and demonstrates\nthe benefits of a less traditional training approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2019 02:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

While eventually mastered by domain experts, their\ninterpretation poses a major challenge for automated analysis. Understanding\nnoun compounds' syntax and semantics is important for many natural language\napplications, including question answering, machine translation, information\nretrieval, and information extraction. I address the problem of noun compounds\nsyntax by means of novel, highly accurate unsupervised and lightly supervised\nalgorithms using the Web as a corpus and search engines as interfaces to that\ncorpus. Traditionally the Web has been viewed as a source of page hit counts,\nused as an estimate for n-gram word frequencies. I extend this approach by\nintroducing novel surface features and paraphrases, which yield\nstate-of-the-art results for the task of noun compound bracketing. I also show\nhow these kinds of features can be applied to other structural ambiguity\nproblems, like prepositional phrase attachment and noun phrase coordination. I\naddress noun compound semantics by automatically generating paraphrasing verbs\nand prepositions that make explicit the hidden semantic relations between the\nnouns in a noun compound. I also demonstrate how these paraphrasing verbs can\nbe used to solve various relational similarity problems, and how paraphrasing\nnoun compounds can improve machine translation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2019 21:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

The state-of-the-art approaches\npartition the molecules into a large set of substructures $S$ and grow the new\nmolecule structure by iteratively predicting which substructure from $S$ to\nadd. However, since the set of available substructures $S$ is large, such an\niterative prediction task is often inaccurate especially for substructures that\nare infrequent in the training data. To address this challenge, we propose a\nnew generating strategy called \"Copy & Refine\" (CORE), where at each step the\ngenerator first decides whether to copy an existing substructure from input $X$\nor to generate a new substructure, then the most promising substructure will be\nadded to the new molecule. Combining together with scaffolding tree generation\nand adversarial training, CORE can significantly improve several latest\nmolecule optimization methods in various measures including drug likeness\n(QED), dopamine receptor (DRD2) and penalized LogP. We tested CORE and\nbaselines using the ZINC database and CORE obtained up to 11% and 21%\nrelatively improvement over the baselines on success rate on the complete test\nset and the subset with infrequent substructures, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2019 23:02:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-13"}

Most of the studies so\nfar focused on reducing the visibility by reshaping the electromagnetic\nscattering in the spatial domain. In fact, by manipulating the electromagnetic\nscattering in the time domain, the visibility of an object can also be reduced.\nImportantly, unlike previous studies on phase-switched screens and time-varying\nmetasurfaces, where the effect is narrow band due to the dispersive resonance,\nfor microwave frequency range, we introduce a broadband switchable metasurface\nintegrated with p-i-n diodes. The reflection phase of the metasurface can be\nchanged by approximately {\\pi} over a fractional bandwidth of 76%. By\nmodulating the metasurface quasirandomly in the time domain, the incident\nnarrow-band signal is spread into a white-noiselike spectrum upon reflection,\ncreating a spectral camouflage. The broadband feature of the proposed\ntime-varying metasurface can provide practical insight for various\napplications, including radar stealth and ultrawide-band wireless\ncommunication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2019 01:51:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}
