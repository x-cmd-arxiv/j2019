Demand for\nsuch services is expected to growth rapid, which will require a search for\nBeyond 5G technological advancements in wireless communications. Part of these\nadvancements is the need for additional spectrum, namely moving toward the\nterahertz (THz) range. To compensate for the high path loss in THz, narrow\nbeamwidths are used to improve antenna gains. However, with narrow beamwidths,\neven minor fluctuations in device location (such as through body movement) can\ncause frequent link failures due to beam misalignment. In this paper, we\nprovide a solution to these small-scale indoor movement that result in\nmobility-induced outages. Like a moth randomly flutters about, Mobility-induced\nOutages in THz (MOTH) can be ephemeral in nature and hard to avoid. To deal\nwith MOTH we propose two methods to predict these outage scenarios: (i)\nAlign-After-Failure (AAF), which predicts based on fixed time margins, and (ii)\nAlign-Before-Failure (ABF), which learns the time margins through user mobility\npatterns. In this paper, two different online classifiers were used to train\nthe ABF model to predicate if a mobility-induced outage is going to occur;\nthereby, significantly reducing the time spent in outage scenarios. Simulation\nresults demonstrate a relationship between optimal beamwidth and human mobility\npatterns. Additionally, to cater to a future with dense deployment of Wireless\nPersonal Area Network (WPAN), it is necessary that we have efficient deployment\nof resources (e.g., THz-APs). One solution is to maximize the user coverage for\na single AP, which might be dependent on multiple parameters. We identify these\nparameters and observe their tradeoffs for improving user coverage through a\nsingle THz-AP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 16:30:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 21:18:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

Despite over fifty years of robotic exploration, including thirteen\nsuccessful atmosphere probes and landers, our knowledge of N2, the\nsecond-most-abundant compound in the atmosphere, is highly uncertain (von Zahn\net al., 1983). We report the first measurement of the nitrogen content of\nVenus' atmosphere at altitudes between 60 and 100 km. Our result, 5.0 +/- 0.4\nv% N2, is significantly higher than the value of 3.5 v% N2 reported for the\nlower atmosphere (<50 km altitude). We conclude that Venus' atmosphere contains\ntwo chemically-distinct regions, contrasting sharply with the expectation that\nit should be uniform across these altitude due to turbulent mixing (e.g. Oyama\net al., 1980). That the lower-mass component is more concentrated at high\naltitudes suggests that the chemical profile of the atmosphere above 50-km\naltitude reflects mass segregation of CO2 and N2. A similar boundary between\nwell-mixed and mass-segregated materials exists for Earth, however it is\nlocated at a substantially higher altitude of ~100 km. That Venus' upper and\nlower atmosphere are not in chemical equilibrium complicates efforts to use\nremote sensing measurements to infer the properties of the lower atmosphere and\nsurface, a lesson that also applied to the growing field of exoplanet\nastronomy. The observation of periodic increases in SO2 concentrations in\nVenus' upper atmosphere, which has been cited as evidence for active volcanic\neruptions at the surface (Esposito et al., 1984), may instead be attributable\nto atmosphere processes that periodically inject SO2 from the lower atmosphere\ninto the upper atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 16:40:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 14:16:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}

Materials and Methods Using\nbioinformatics analysis, the lung squamous cell carcinoma microarray datasets\nfrom the GEO and TCGA databases were analyzed to identify differentially\nexpressed genes(DEGs). Furthermore, PPI and WGCNA network analysis were\nintegrated to identify the key genes closely related to the process of LUSC\ndevelopment. In addition, survival analysis was performed to achieve a\nprognostic model that accomplished a high level of prediction accuracy. Results\nand Conclusion Eighty-five up-regulated and 39 down-regulated genes were\nidentified, on which functional and pathway enrichment analysis was conducted.\nGO analysis demonstrated that up-regulated genes were principally enriched in\nepidermal development and DNA unwinding in DNA replication. Down-regulated\ngenes were mainly involved in cell adhesion, signal transduction and positive\nregulation of inflammatory response. After PPI and WGCNA network analysis,\neight genes, including AURKA, RAD51, TTK, AURKB, CCNA2, TPX2, KPNA2 and KIF23,\nhave been found to play a vital role in LUSC development.

In this work we\nexamine the effect of hyper-viscosity on decaying turbulence for values of $p$\nranging from $p=1$ (regular viscosity) up to $p=100$. Our study is based on\ndirect numerical simulations of the Taylor-Green vortex for resolutions from\n$512^3$ to $2048^3$. Our results demonstrate that the evolution of the total\nenergy $E$ and the energy dissipation $\\epsilon$ remain almost unaffected by\nthe order of the hyper-viscosity used. However, as the order of the\nhyper-viscosity is increased ,the energy spectrum develops a more pronounced\nbottleneck that contaminates the inertial range. At the largest values of $p$\nexamined, the spectrum at the bottleneck range has a positive power-law\nbehavior $E(k)\\propto k^\\alpha$ with the power-law exponent $\\alpha$\napproaching the value obtained in flows at thermal equilibrium $\\alpha=2$. This\nagrees with the prediction of Frisch et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 144501\n(2008)] who suggested that at high values of $p$, the flow should behave like\nthe truncated Euler equations (TEE). Nonetheless, despite the thermalization of\nthe spectrum, the flow retains a finite dissipation rate up to the examined\norder, which disagrees with the predictions of the TEE system implying\nsuppression of energy dissipation. We reconcile the two apparently\ncontradictory results, predicting the value of $p$ for which the hyper-viscous\nNavier-Stokes goes over to the TEE system and we discuss why thermalization\nappears at smaller values of $p$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 17:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

MIL is gaining traction\nfor learning from weak labels but has not been widely applied to 3D medical\nimaging. MIL is well-suited to clinical CT acquisitions since (1) the highly\nanisotropic voxels hinder application of traditional 3D networks and (2)\npatch-based networks have limited ability to learn whole volume labels. In this\nwork, we apply MIL with a deep convolutional neural network to identify whether\nclinical CT head image volumes possess one or more large hemorrhages (>\n20cm$^3$), resulting in a learned 2D model without the need for 2D slice\nannotations.

However, requiring up front\nunambiguous grammars can force language designers to make more or less\narbitrary choices to disambiguate the language. In this paper, we depart from\nthe traditional view of unambiguous grammar design, and enable the detection of\nambiguities to be delayed until parse time, allowing the user of the language\nto perform the disambiguation. A natural decision problem follows: given a\nlanguage definition, can a user always disambiguate an ambiguous program? We\nintroduce and formalize this fundamental problem - called the resolvable\nambiguity problem - and divide it into separate static and dynamic\nresolvability problems. We provide solutions to the static problem for a\nrestricted language class and sketch proofs of soundness and completeness. We\nalso provide a sound and complete solution to the dynamic problem for a much\nless restricted class of languages. The approach is evaluated through two\nseparate case studies, covering both a large existing programming language, and\nthe composability of domain-specific languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 17:51:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 13:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

In\nthis work, we perform a black-box timing analysis of TPM 2.0 devices deployed\non commodity computers. Our analysis reveals that some of these devices feature\nsecret-dependent execution times during signature generation based on elliptic\ncurves. In particular, we discovered timing leakage on an Intel firmware-based\nTPM as well as a hardware TPM. We show how this information allows an attacker\nto apply lattice techniques to recover 256-bit private keys for ECDSA and\nECSchnorr signatures. On Intel fTPM, our key recovery succeeds after about\n1,300 observations and in less than two minutes. Similarly, we extract the\nprivate ECDSA key from a hardware TPM manufactured by STMicroelectronics, which\nis certified at Common Criteria (CC) EAL 4+, after fewer than 40,000\nobservations. We further highlight the impact of these vulnerabilities by\ndemonstrating a remote attack against a StrongSwan IPsec VPN that uses a TPM to\ngenerate the digital signatures for authentication. In this attack, the remote\nclient recovers the server's private authentication key by timing only 45,000\nauthentication handshakes via a network connection.\n  The vulnerabilities we have uncovered emphasize the difficulty of correctly\nimplementing known constant-time techniques, and show the importance of\nevolutionary testing and transparent evaluation of cryptographic\nimplementations.

In the scenario, the standard model Yukawa\ncouplings of quarks are dynamical, being of order one during the inflationary\nera and reducing to their standard model values once it ends. This means that\nafter inflation the contribution of the small instantons is suppressed, and the\naxion potential reduces to the standard one from the usual IR instantons.

We study the possibility to search for anisotropies by investigating\nneutrino-UHECR correlations from the theoretical perspective, taking into\naccount the UHECR horizon, magnetic-field deflections, and the cosmological\nsource evolution. Under the assumption that the neutrinos and UHECRs all come\nfrom the same source class, we demonstrate that the non-observation of neutrino\nmultiplets strongly constrains the possibility to find neutrino-UHECR\ncorrelations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 19:02:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 21:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Our new factor group-sparse regularizers are motivated as a\nrelaxation of the number of nonzero columns in a factorization of the matrix.\nThese nonconvex regularizers are sharper than the nuclear norm; indeed, we show\nthey are related to Schatten-$p$ norms with arbitrarily small $0 < p \\leq 1$.\nMoreover, these factor group-sparse regularizers can be written in a factored\nform that enables efficient and effective nonconvex optimization; notably, the\nmethod does not use singular value decomposition. We provide generalization\nerror bounds for low-rank matrix completion which show improved upper bounds\nfor Schatten-$p$ norm reglarization as $p$ decreases. Compared to the max norm\nand the factored formulation of the nuclear norm, factor group-sparse\nregularizers are more efficient, accurate, and robust to the initial guess of\nrank. Experiments show promising performance of factor group-sparse\nregularization for low-rank matrix completion and robust principal component\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 19:30:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 16:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

The availability of such\nlarge-scale transit data offers new opportunities to produce estimates for\nOrigin-Destination (O-D) flows, helping inform transportation planning and\ntransit management. However, the state-of-the-art methodologies for AVL/APC\ndata analysis mostly tackle the O-D flow estimation problem within routes and\nbarely infer the transfer activities across the entire transit network. This\npaper proposes three optimization models to identify transfers and approximate\nnetwork-level O-D flows by minimizing the deviations between estimated and\nobserved proportions or counts of transferring passengers: A Quadratic Integer\nProgram (QIP), a feasible rounding procedure for the Quadratic Convex\nProgramming (QCP) relaxation of the QIP, and an Integer Program (IP). The\ninputs of the models are readily available by applying the various route-level\nflow estimation algorithms to the automatically collected AVL/APC data and the\noutput of the models is a network O-D estimation at varying geographical\nresolutions. The optimization models were evaluated on a case study for Ann\nArbor-Ypsilanti area in Michigan. The IP model outperforms the QCP approach in\nterms of accuracy and remains tractable from an efficiency standpoint, contrary\nto the QIP.

In a process that does not affect the cyclic\ntopology, it is assumed that, before the multiplex is assembled, the nodes are\nlabeled differently in each individual layer. As the setup requires that all\nrepresentations of the same node in the different $M$ layers must be linked by\ninter-layers connections, the resulting multiplex pattern can be highly\ncomplex. This can be better visualized if one assumes that in one layer the\nnodes are labeled in the sequentially ascending order and that the nodes with\nthe same label are drawn on the top of the other, so that all inter-layer\nconnections are represented by vertical lines. In such cases, the other $M-1$\nlayers are characterized by long distance shortcuts. As a consequence, in spite\nof sharing the same internal topological structure, the multiplex ends up with\nvery dissimilar layers. For prime number of nodes, a regular star geometry\narises by requiring that the neighbor labels of the $M-1$ layers differ by a\nconstant value $p_i>1$. For $M=2$, we use analytical and numerical approaches\nto provide a thorough characterization of the multiplex topological properties,\nof the inter layer dissimilarity, and of the diffusive dynamical processes\ntaking place on them.

Early BHs likely fill a continuum\nfrom stellar-mass (approx. 10 Msun) to the super-massive ($\\approx$10^9 Msun)\nregime, reflecting a range of initial masses and growth histories. (2)\nStellar-mass BHs were likely left behind by the first generation of stars at\nredshifts as high as z=30, but their initial growth was typically stunted due\nto the shallow potential wells of their host galaxies. (3) Conditions in some\nlarger, metal-poor galaxies soon became conducive to the rapid formation and\ngrowth of massive `seed' holes, via gas accretion and by mergers in dense\nstellar clusters. (4) BH masses depend on the environment (such as the number\nand properties of nearby radiation sources and the local baryonic streaming\nvelocity), and on the metal enrichment and assembly history of the host galaxy.\n(5) Distinguishing between assembly mechanisms will be difficult, but a\ncombination of observations by LISA (probing massive BH growth via mergers) and\nby deep multi-wavelength electromagnetic observations (probing growth via gas\naccretion) is particularly promising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 20:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

Delayed neutrons have isotope-characteristic spectral and\ntemporal signatures, which provide the basis for isotope identification.\nHowever, in bulk materials that contain an appreciable fissile (e.g., $^{235}$U\nor $^{233}$U) fraction, such as highly-enriched uranium (HEU), delayed neutrons\nhave a high probability of inducing additional fissions. As a result, the\noverall delayed neutron signature consists of two distinct components: the\n\"primary\" delayed neutrons (emitted directly by fission fragments), and the\n\"secondary prompt\" fission neutrons produced in fission induced by primary\ndelayed neutrons. These prompt products differ from \"primary\" delayed neutrons\nboth in their energy spectra and in the presence of coincident radiation\nreleased by the parent fission event. The presence and relative quantity of\nprompt products from delayed fission depend on the cross-section of the\nmaterial in the energy range of delayed neutrons, which may differ\nsignificantly between isotopes, thus providing an exploitable means for isotope\ndifferentiation. In this work, we demonstrate two experimental approaches for\ndiscriminating between $^{235}$U and $^{238}$U isotopes based on the\nmeasurement of delayed neutron-induced fission products. First, HEU and\ndepleted uranium objects are differentiated through the detection of\nhigh-energy prompt neutrons from delayed fission using both recoil-based\norganic liquid scintillators and thermalization spectra from a custom-built\ncapture-gated composite detector. Secondly, coincident radiation measurements\nare used as the basis for discrimination by comparing the overall rates and\ntime evolution of fission events when delayed neutrons are present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 21:00:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 19:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

The approach is based on a\nformulation that utilizes an appropriate Helmholtz decomposition of the flux\nvector and is related to the standard notion of a weak solution. This\nrelationship, together with a corresponding connection to negative-norm\nleast-squares, is described in detail. As a consequence, an important numerical\nconservation theorem is obtained, similar to the famous Lax-Wendroff theorem.\nThe numerical conservation properties of the method in this paper do not fall\nprecisely in the framework introduced by Lax and Wendroff, but they are similar\nin spirit as they guarantee that when $L^2$ convergence holds, the resulting\napproximations approach a weak solution to the hyperbolic problem. The\nleast-squares functional is continuous and coercive in an $H^{-1}$-type norm,\nbut not $L^2$-coercive. Nevertheless, the $L^2$ convergence properties of the\nmethod are discussed. Convergence can be obtained either by an explicit\nregularization of the functional, that provides control of the $L^2$ norm, or\nby properly choosing the finite element spaces, providing implicit control of\nthe $L^2$ norm. Numerical results for the inviscid Burgers equation with\ndiscontinuous source terms are shown, demonstrating the $L^2$ convergence of\nthe obtained approximations to the physically admissible solution. The\nnumerical method utilizes a least-squares functional, minimized on finite\nelement spaces, and a Gauss-Newton technique with nested iteration.

We introduce RecyGlide, which is a novel\nwearable forearm multimodal display at the forearm. The RecyGlide is composed\nof inverted five-bar linkages and vibration motors. The device provides\nmultimodal tactile feedback such as slippage, a force vector, pressure, and\nvibration. We tested the discrimination ability of monomodal and multimodal\nstimuli patterns in the forearm and confirmed that the multimodal stimuli\npatterns are more recognizable. This haptic device was used in VR applications,\nand we proved that it enhances VR experience and makes it more interactive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 22:48:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2019 07:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

A key benefit of\nthe Mat\\'ern class is that it is possible to get precise control over the\ndegree of mean-square differentiability of the random process. However, the\nMat\\'ern class possesses exponentially decaying tails, and thus may not be\nsuitable for modeling polynomially decaying dependence. This problem can be\nremedied using polynomial covariances; however one loses control over the\ndegree of mean-square differentiability of corresponding processes, in that\nrandom processes with existing polynomial covariances are either infinitely\nmean-square differentiable or nowhere mean-square differentiable at all. We\nconstruct a new family of covariance functions called the \\emph{Confluent\nHypergeometric} (CH) class using a scale mixture representation of the Mat\\'ern\nclass where one obtains the benefits of both Mat\\'ern and polynomial\ncovariances. The resultant covariance contains two parameters: one controls the\ndegree of mean-square differentiability near the origin and the other controls\nthe tail heaviness, independently of each other. Using a spectral\nrepresentation, we derive theoretical properties of this new covariance\nincluding equivalent measures and asymptotic behavior of the maximum likelihood\nestimators under infill asymptotics. The improved theoretical properties of the\nCH class are verified via extensive simulations.

When extreme\nprecipitation possesses strong spatial dependence, the risk of flooding is\namplified due to catchment factors that cause runoff accumulation such as\ntopography. Temporal dependence can also increase flood risk as storm water\ndrainage systems operating at capacity can be overwhelmed by heavy\nprecipitation occurring over multiple days. While transformed Gaussian\nprocesses are common choices for modeling precipitation, their weak tail\ndependence may lead to underestimation of flood risk. Extreme value models such\nas the generalized Pareto processes for threshold exceedances and max-stable\nmodels are attractive alternatives, but are difficult to fit when the number of\nobservation sites is large, and are of little use for modeling the bulk of the\ndistribution, which may also be of interest to water management planners.

We derive the radius of the nucleus to be $<7$ km using the\nnon-detection in November 2018, and estimate an area of $\\sim0.5$---$10\n\\mathrm{km^2}$ has been active between December 2018 and September 2019, though\nthis number is model-dependent and is highly uncertain. The behavior of comet\nBorisov during its inbound leg is observationally consistent with dynamically\nnew comets observed in our solar system, suggesting some similarities between\nthe two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 02:34:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 21:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

Generally, this hybrid transceiver\nstructure requires a joint design of analog and digital processing to enable\nboth beamsteering and spatial multiplexing gains. In this paper, we develop\nvarious weighted mean-square-error minimization (WMMSE) based hybrid\ntransceiver designs over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference\nchannels at both millimeter wave (mmWave) and microwave frequencies. Firstly, a\nheuristic joint design of hybrid precoder and combiner using alternating\noptimization is proposed, in which the majorization-minimization (MM) method is\nutilized to design the analog precoder and combiner with unit-modulus\nconstraints. It is validated that this scheme achieves the comparable\nperformance to the WMMSE fully-digital solution. To further reduce the\ncomplexity, a phase projection-based two-stage scheme is proposed to decouple\nthe designs of analog and digital precoder combiner. Secondly, inspired by the\nfully-digital solutions based on the block-diagonalization zero-forcing (BD-ZF)\nand signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) criteria, low-complexity MMbased\nBD-ZF and SLNR hybrid designs are proposed to well approximate the\ncorresponding fully-digital solutions. Thirdly, the partially-connected hybrid\nstructure for reducing system hardware cost and power consumption is\nconsidered, for which the MM-based alternating optimization still works.\nNumerical results demonstrate the similar or superior performance of all the\nabove proposed schemes over the existing benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 02:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

In these problems, the ability to explain how the\nattributes affect the prediction is critical to users. However, most, if not\nall, existing ordinal regression models simplify such explanation in the form\nof constant coefficients for the main and interaction effects of individual\nattributes. Such explanation cannot characterize the contributions of\nattributes at different value scales. To address this challenge, we propose a\nnew explainable ordinal regression model, namely, the Explainable Ordinal\nFactorization Model (XOFM). XOFM uses the piece-wise linear functions to\napproximate the actual contributions of individual attributes and their\ninteractions. Moreover, XOFM introduces a novel ordinal transformation process\nto assign each object the probabilities of belonging to multiple relevant\nclasses, instead of fixing boundaries to differentiate classes. XOFM is based\non the Factorization Machines to handle the potential sparsity problem as a\nresult of discretizing the attribute scales. Comprehensive experiments with\nbenchmark datasets and baseline models demonstrate that the proposed XOFM\nexhibits superior explainability and leads to state-of-the-art prediction\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 02:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}

In\nthis paper, we \\emph{theoretically} prove that the weight decay term\n$\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda||{\\boldsymbol{W}}||^2$ merely modulates the effective\nlearning rate for improving objective optimization, and has no influence on\ngeneralization when the weight normalization family is compositely employed.\nFurthermore, we also expose several critical problems when introducing weight\ndecay term to weight normalization family, including the missing of global\nminimum and training instability. To address these problems, we propose an\n$\\epsilon-$shifted $L_2$ regularizer, which shifts the $L_2$ objective by a\npositive constant $\\epsilon$. Such a simple operation can theoretically\nguarantee the existence of global minimum, while preventing the network weights\nfrom being too small and thus avoiding gradient float overflow. It\nsignificantly improves the training stability and can achieve slightly better\nperformance in our practice. The effectiveness of $\\epsilon-$shifted $L_2$\nregularizer is comprehensively validated on the ImageNet, CIFAR-100, and COCO\ndatasets.

This may affect the security of ethereum, so light\nbootstrapping techniques such as fast sync has been proposed to download only\nparts of full data, yet the space overhead is still too high. One of the\nbiggest space overhead that cannot easily be reduced is caused by saving the\nstate of all accounts in the block's state trie. Fortunately, we found that\nmore than 90% of accounts are inactive and old transactions are hard to be\nmanipulated. Based on these observations, this paper propose a novel\noptimization technique called ethanos that can reduce bootstrapping cost by\nsweeping inactive accounts periodically and by not downloading old\ntransactions. If an inactive account becomes active, ethanos restore its state\nby running a restoration transaction. Also, ethanos gives incentives for\narchive nodes to maintain the old transactions for possible re-verification. We\nimplemented ethanos by instrumenting the go-ethereum (geth) client and\nevaluated with the real 113 million transactions from 14 million accounts\nbetween 7M-th and 8M-th blocks in ethereum. Our experimental result shows that\nethanos can reduce the size of the account state by half, which, if combined\nwith removing old transactions, may reduce the storage size for bootstrapping\nto around 1GB. This would be reasonable enough for ordinary clients to\nbootstrap on their personal devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 05:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}

However, existing\nGNN models mainly focus on designing graph convolution operations. The graph\npooling (or downsampling) operations, that play an important role in learning\nhierarchical representations, are usually overlooked. In this paper, we propose\na novel graph pooling operator, called Hierarchical Graph Pooling with\nStructure Learning (HGP-SL), which can be integrated into various graph neural\nnetwork architectures. HGP-SL incorporates graph pooling and structure learning\ninto a unified module to generate hierarchical representations of graphs. More\nspecifically, the graph pooling operation adaptively selects a subset of nodes\nto form an induced subgraph for the subsequent layers. To preserve the\nintegrity of graph's topological information, we further introduce a structure\nlearning mechanism to learn a refined graph structure for the pooled graph at\neach layer. By combining HGP-SL operator with graph neural networks, we perform\ngraph level representation learning with focus on graph classification task.\nExperimental results on six widely used benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 05:55:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 02:00:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Dec 2019 15:09:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-30"}

Whereas, in accelerators, the beam suffers from a\nmixture of ion trapping effect and fast ion effect, leading to a more\ncomplicated process and requiring a self-consistent treatment. To evaluate the\nbeam characteristics, as emittance growth under the influence from beam-ion\neffect, a new numerical simulation code based on the \"quasi-strong-strong\"\nmodel has been developed, including modules of ionization, beam-ion\ninteraction, synchrotron radiation damping, quantum excitation, bunch-by-bunch\nfeedback, etc. In the study, we do not regularly distinguish the ion trapping\neffect and the fast ion effect, but treat beam-ion interaction more generally\nand consistently. The lattice of High Energy Photon Source, a diffraction limit\nring under construction in Beijing, is used as an example to show the beam-ion\neffect. It is found that in this low emittance ring, the beam-ion instability\nis not a dominant mechanism in operation mode with a high beam current, but\nseriously occurs in a lower beam current region.

Although ongoing advances in acoustic metamaterials have unlocked\nunprecedented possibilities and various metamaterial absorbers have been\nproposed, most of them only work adequately in the condition of no sound\ntransmissions.

The main challenge lies in mapping images and\ntext to a shared latent space where the embeddings corresponding to a similar\nsemantic concept lie closer to each other than the embeddings corresponding to\ndifferent semantic concepts, irrespective of the modality. Ranking losses are\ncommonly used to create such shared latent space -- however, they do not impose\nany constraints on inter-class relationships resulting in neighboring clusters\nto be completely unrelated. The works in the domain of visual semantic\nembeddings address this problem by first constructing a semantic embedding\nspace based on some external knowledge and projecting image embeddings onto\nthis fixed semantic embedding space. These works are confined only to image\ndomain and constraining the embeddings to a fixed space adds additional burden\non learning. This paper proposes a novel method, HUSE, to learn cross-modal\nrepresentation with semantic information. HUSE learns a shared latent space\nwhere the distance between any two universal embeddings is similar to the\ndistance between their corresponding class embeddings in the semantic embedding\nspace. HUSE also uses a classification objective with a shared classification\nlayer to make sure that the image and text embeddings are in the same shared\nlatent space.

The notion of approximation can be\nadditive, multiplicative, or both, and many variants of this problem have been\nextensively studied. We study the problem of computing a graph spanner when the\nedges of the input graph are distributed across two or more sites in an\narbitrary, possibly worst-case partition, and the goal is for the sites to\nminimize the communication used to output a spanner. We assume the\nmessage-passing model of communication, for which there is a point-to-point\nlink between all pairs of sites as well as a coordinator who is responsible for\nproducing the output. We stress that the subset of edges that each site has is\nnot related to the network topology, which is fixed to be point-to-point. While\nthis model has been extensively studied for related problems such as graph\nconnectivity, it has not been systematically studied for graph spanners. We\npresent the first tradeoffs for total communication versus the quality of the\nspanners computed, for two or more sites, as well as for additive and\nmultiplicative notions of distortion. We show separations in the communication\ncomplexity when edges are allowed to occur on multiple sites, versus when each\nedge occurs on at most one site.

In particular, systematic studies of jet\nproduction in different multiplicity environments will provide in-depth\nunderstanding of the medium properties and their evolution from small to large\nsystems. In small systems and high multiplicity events, the bulk properties\nextracted by the low transverse momentum particle production behaves as if a\nhot QCD medium was created, but such behaviour is not observed with hard\nprobes.

The emergence of a temperature\nin spacetimes with an event horizon has unveiled the existence of a fertile\nterritory, where gravity, thermal and quantum effects are non-trivially\nconnected. Although black holes are the best arena to explore this interplay,\nevidences for their existence are lacking, suggesting to address less exotic\ncontexts. In this sense, a promising stage is the QFT in curved space:\nspecifically, the Unruh effect (UE) provides the first step toward unifying the\nquantum and gravity worlds via the EP. Waiting for a successful theory of\nquantum gravity, a careful investigation of UE, and, in particular, of any\ndeviations of Unruh spectrum from its thermal behavior, may thus offer a window\nto new physics in the limbo between GR and QFT. Here we study the connection\nbetween geometric features of spacetime and ensuing thermal quantum phenomena\nfrom a non-traditional perspective, based on the analysis of perturbative\neffects that affect the standard scenarios. As a test bench, we consider the\nUE. After a discussion on the origin of UE, we examine to what extent its\ndistinctive profile is spoilt i) for mixed neutrinos; ii) in presence of a\nminimal length arising from gravity at Planck scale.

On the other, we focus on the effects induced\nby deformations of HUP, exploring the possibility to constrain the\nGUP-parameter via UE.

Along this line, we provide a unifying\nperspective of these effects, which still relies on a geometric interpretation\nof their origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 09:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}

We restrict ourselves to an RMS\nvalue of EGMF, $B_{\\rm rms}\\sim 10^{-5}$ nG, for a significant contribution to\nthe photon spectral energy distribution (SED) from UHECR interactions. We found\nthat UHECR interactions on the EBL and secondary cascade emission can fit\ngamma-ray data from the BL Lacs we considered at the highest energies.

Here, it is\ndemonstrated that staggered bianisotropic response gives rise to the\ntopological states even in a simple lattice geometry whose counterpart with\nuniform bianisotropy is topologically trivial. The reason behind this\nintriguing behavior is in the difference of the effective coupling between the\nresonant elements with the same and with the opposite signs of bianisotropy.\nBased on this insight, a one-dimensional equidistant array is designed, which\nconsists of high-index all-dielectric particles with alternating signs of\nbianisotropic response.

Its scientific objectives are to\ncharacterize electron precipitation from the radiation belts and to observe\nenergetic neutral atoms (ENAs) originating from the Sun during the strongest\nsolar flares. For that purpose, the 3-unit CubeSat carries a particle telescope\nthat measures energetic electrons in the nominal energy range of 80--800 keV in\nseven energy channels and energetic protons at 0.3--10 MeV in ten channels. In\naddition, particles penetrating the whole telescope at higher energies will be\nmeasured in three channels: one $>$800 keV electron channel, two integral\nproton channels at $>$10 MeV energies. The instrument contains two telescopes\nat right angles to each other, one measuring along the spin axis of the\nspacecraft and one perpendicular to it. During a spin period (nominally 15 s),\nthe rotating telescope will, thus, deliver angular distributions of protons and\nelectrons, at 11.25-degree clock-angle resolution, which enables one to\naccurately determine the pitch-angle distribution and separate the trapped and\nprecipitating particles. During the last part of the mission, the rotation axis\nwill be accurately pointed toward the Sun, enabling the measurement of the\nenergetic hydrogen from that direction. Using the geomagnetic field as a filter\nand comparing the rates observed by the two telescopes, the instrument can\nobserve the solar ENA flux for events similar to the only one so far observed\nin December 2006.

Existing methods often do\nnot consider different granularity in visual similarity. However, in many\ndomain applications, images exhibit similarity at multiple granularities with\nvisual semantic concepts, e.g. fashion demonstrates similarity ranging from\nclothing of the exact same instance to similar looks/design or a common\ncategory. Therefore, training image triplets/pairs used for metric learning\ninherently possess different degree of information. However, the existing\nmethods often treats them with equal importance during training. This hinders\ncapturing the underlying granularities in feature similarity required for\neffective visual search.\n  In view of this, we propose a new deep semantic granularity metric learning\n(SGML) that develops a novel idea of leveraging attribute semantic space to\ncapture different granularity of similarity, and then integrate this\ninformation into deep metric learning. The proposed method simultaneously\nlearns image attributes and embeddings using multitask CNNs. The two tasks are\nnot only jointly optimized but are further linked by the semantic granularity\nsimilarity mappings to leverage the correlations between the tasks. To this\nend, we propose a new soft-binomial deviance loss that effectively integrates\nthe degree of information in training samples, which helps to capture visual\nsimilarity at multiple granularities. Compared to recent ensemble-based\nmethods, our framework is conceptually elegant, computationally simple and\nprovides better performance. We perform extensive experiments on benchmark\nmetric learning datasets and demonstrate that our method outperforms recent\nstate-of-the-art methods, e.g., 1-4.5\\% improvement in Recall@1 over the\nprevious state-of-the-arts [1],[2] on DeepFashion In-Shop dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 11:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-17"}

Here, a\ntwo-dimensional implementation of the combined finite-discrete element method\n(FDEM), which merges the finite element method (FEM) and the discrete element\nmethod (DEM), is used to explicitly to simulate a sheared granular fault\nsystem. We focus on investigating the influence of normal load, driving shear\nvelocity and plate stiffness on the velocities and displacements measured at\nlocations on the upper and lower plates just adjacent to the gouge in the\ndirection parallel to the shear direction (x direction). The simulations show\nthat at slips the plate velocities are proportional to the normal load and may\nbe inversely proportional to the square root of the plate's Young's modulus;\nwhereas the driving shear velocity does not show distinct influence on the\nplate velocities. During stick phases, the velocities of the upper and lower\nplates are respectively slightly greater and slightly smaller than the half of\nthe driving shear velocity, and are both in the same direction of shear. The\nshear strain rate of the gouge is calculated from this velocity difference\nbetween the upper and lower plate during stick phases and thus the gouge\neffective shear modulus can be calculated. The results show that the gouge\neffective shear modulus increases proportionally with normal load, while the\ninfluence of shear velocity and plate stiffness on gouge effective shear\nmodulus is minor.

Significant work continues to be reported in\nthe roughness regime at high Reynolds numbers where the cumulative effect of\nsurface undulations on the averaged and integrated turbulence quantities is\nwell documented. Even for such cases, the surface topology plays an important\nrole for transitional roughness Reynolds numbers that is hard to characterize.\nIn this work, we attempt to develop a bottom up understanding of the mechanisms\nunderlying turbulence generation and transport, particularly within the region\nof the turbulent boundary layer (TBL) affected by the surface. We relate\nsurface characteristics with turbulence generation mechanisms, Reynolds stress\ntransport and the resulting drag increase. To this end, we perform a suite of\ndirect numerical simulations of fully developed turbulent flow between two\ninfinitely wide, two-dimensional sinusoidally wavy surfaces at a friction\nReynolds number, $Re_{\\tau}=180$, with different mean surface slopes, $\\zeta$\n(and fixed inner-scaled undulation height, $a^+=13$) corresponding to the\n`waviness' regime. The increase in wave slope enhances near surface turbulent\nmixing resulting in increased total drag, higher fraction of form drag, faster\napproach to isotropy and thereby, modulation of the buffer layer. The primary\nnear-surface streamwise and vertical turbulence generation occurs in the\nleeward and windward side of the wave. In contrast, the spanwise variance is\nproduced through pressure-rate-of-strain mechanism, primarily, along the\nwindward side of the wave for flows with very little flow separation. We also\nobserve significant dispersion effects in the production structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 12:01:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 15:35:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

To keep the\ncomputational demands low these neural networks typically operate on small\nimage sizes which, however, makes it difficult to detect small objects. This is\nfurther emphasized when considering UAVs equipped with cameras where due to the\nviewing range, objects tend to appear relatively small. This paper therefore,\nexplores the trade-offs involved when maintaining the resolution of the objects\nof interest by extracting smaller patches (tiles) from the larger input image\nand processing them using a neural network. Specifically, we introduce an\nattention mechanism to focus on detecting objects only in some of the tiles and\na memory mechanism to keep track of information for tiles that are not\nprocessed. Through the analysis of different methods and experiments we show\nthat by carefully selecting which tiles to process we can considerably improve\nthe detection accuracy while maintaining comparable performance to CNNs that\nresize and process a single image which makes the proposed approach suitable\nfor UAV applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 12:50:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}

In this paper, we present a full\ntheoretical description of the collective resonance in superstructures. We use\nthe gold nanorods as individual building blocks and arrange them helically\nalong an axis in an end-to-end fashion. Numerical simulations on single-unit\ncells reveal that the plasmonic coupling between the nanorods produces\nhybridized resonances, whose intensity is strongly dependent on the excitation\nlight with left- or right-handed circular polarizations (LCP or RCP). A\nnode-mode criterion is proposed on the basis of the microscopic mechanism,\nwhich successfully explains the difference between LCP and RCP. We further\ndemonstrate, by repeating the unit cell from 1 to infinity along the helical\naxis, the multiple hybridized resonances gradually evolve and merge into a\nsingle collective resonance, whose energy is also dependent on LCP and RCP. An\nanalytical description is provided for the collective resonance of the helical\nsuperstructure on the basis of the coupled dipole approximation method. Our\ntheory shows that n collective resonance modes are present in the helical\nsuperstructure with the unit cell consisting of $n$ nanorods.

Our analysis on\nthe statistics concerning the efficiency of the campaign and the parameters of\nthe projectiles and the impacts is presented. The parameters of the lunar\nimpact flashes based on simultaneous observations in two wavelength bands are\nused to estimate the distributions of the masses, sizes and frequency of the\nimpactors. These statistics can be used both in space engineering and science.\nThe photometric fluxes of the flashes are measured using aperture photometry\nand their apparent magnitudes are calculated using standard stars. Assuming\nthat the flashes follow a black body law of irradiation, the temperatures can\nbe derived analytically, while the parameters of the projectiles are estimated\nusing fair assumptions on their velocity and luminous efficiency of the\nimpacts. 79 lunar impact flashes have been observed with the 1.2 m Kryoneri\ntelescope in Greece. The masses of the meteoroids range between 0.7 g and 8 kg\nand their respective sizes between 1-20 cm depending on their assumed density,\nimpact velocity, and luminous efficiency. We find a strong correlation between\nthe observed magnitudes of the flashes and the masses of the meteoroids.\nMoreover, an empirical relation between the emitted energies of each band has\nbeen derived allowing the estimation of the physical parameters of the\nmeteoroids that produce low energy impact flashes. The NELIOTA project has so\nfar the highest detection rate and the faintest limiting magnitude for lunar\nimpacts compared to other ongoing programs. Based on the impact frequency\ndistribution on Moon, we estimate that sporadic meteoroids with typical masses\nless than 100 g and sizes less than 5 cm enter the mesosphere of the Earth with\na rate ~108 meteoroids/hr and also impact Moon with a rate of ~8 meteoroids/hr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 14:14:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

Slow rotators, which have stellar orbits dominated by random\nmotions, are thought to be the fossil relics of a sequence of multiple gas-poor\nmergers, in an environment where the cold gas required to form new stars is\nnearly absent. Indeed, observations of a handful of nearby galaxy clusters have\nindicated that slow rotators are preferentially found in the gas-poor, dense\ncores of clusters, which themselves must form by merging of smaller groups.\nHowever, the generality of this result and connection between kinematics and\nenvironment is currently unclear, as recent studies have suggested that, at\ngiven stellar mass, the environment does not influence the formation of slow\nrotators. Here we address this issue by combining a careful quality-assessed\nsample selection with two-dimensional stellar kinematics from a large galaxy\nsurvey and a novel photometric classification approach where kinematics are\nunavailable. We obtain the first complete census of the location of massive\nslow rotators in ten large clusters: in all cases, slow rotators are extremely\nrare and generally trace the clusters density peaks. This result unambiguously\nestablishes that massive slow rotators are the relics of violent hierarchical\ncluster formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 14:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}

Although the flux inferred from an individual starburst region is\nexpected to be well below the sensitivity of current neutrino telescopes, such\nsources may provide a substantial contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux\nmeasured by IceCube.

This\nleads, in the ultra-dilute limit, to the alloy CB edge being formed primarily\nof an $A_{1}$-symmetric linear combination of the L-point CB edge states of the\nGe host matrix semiconductor. Our calculations describe the emergence of a\n\"quasi-direct\" alloy band gap, which retains a significant admixture of\nindirect Ge L-point CB edge character. We then analyse the evolution of the\nelectronic structure of realistic (large, disordered) Ge$_{1-x}$C$_{x}$ alloy\nsupercells for C compositions up to $x = 2$%. We show that short-range alloy\ndisorder introduces a distribution of localised states at energies below the Ge\nCB edge, with these states acquiring minimal direct ($\\Gamma$) character. Our\ncalculations demonstrate strong intrinsic inhomogeneous energy broadening of\nthe CB edge Bloch character, driven by hybridisation between Ge host matrix and\nC-related localised states. The trends identified by our calculations are\nmarkedly different to those expected based on a recently proposed\ninterpretation of the CB structure based on the band anti-crossing model. The\nimplications of our findings for device applications are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Following these guidelines, we design our Fully Convolutional\nSiamese tracker++ (SiamFC++) by introducing both classification and target\nstate estimation branch(G1), classification score without ambiguity(G2),\ntracking without prior knowledge(G3), and estimation quality score(G4).\nExtensive analysis and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed guidelines. Without bells and whistles, our SiamFC++ tracker achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on five challenging benchmarks(OTB2015, VOT2018,\nLaSOT, GOT-10k, TrackingNet), which proves both the tracking and generalization\nability of the tracker.

We provide a comprehensive study of\nthe election control problem, investigating two forms of manipulations: seeding\nto buy influencers given a social network, and removing or adding edges in the\nsocial network given the seeds and the information sent. In particular, we\nstudy a wide range of cases distinguishing for the number of candidates or the\nkind of information spread over the network. Our main result is positive for\ndemocracy, and it shows that the election manipulation problem is not\naffordable in the worst-case except for trivial classes of instances, even when\none accepts to approximate the margin of victory. In the case of seeding, we\nalso show that the manipulation is hard even if the graph is a line and that a\nlarge class of algorithms, including most of the approaches recently adopted\nfor social-influence problems, fail to compute a bounded approximation even on\nelementary networks, as undirected graphs with every node having a degree at\nmost two or directed trees.

It is one of the essential\nsteps towards character recognition, writer identification, and script-style\nevolution analysis. The binarization task itself is challenging due to the vast\ndiversity of writing styles, inks, and paper materials. It is even more\ndifficult for historical manuscripts due to the aging and degradation of the\ndocuments over time. One of such manuscripts is the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS)\nimage collection, which poses extreme challenges for the existing binarization\ntechniques. This article proposes a new binarization technique for the DSS\nimages using the deep encoder-decoder networks. Although the artificial neural\nnetwork proposed here is primarily designed to binarize the DSS images, it can\nbe trained on different manuscript collections as well. Additionally, the use\nof transfer learning makes the network already utilizable for a wide range of\nhandwritten documents, making it a unique multi-purpose tool for binarization.\nQualitative results and several quantitative comparisons using both historical\nmanuscripts and datasets from handwritten document image binarization\ncompetition (H-DIBCO and DIBCO) exhibit the robustness and the effectiveness of\nthe system. The best performing network architecture proposed here is a variant\nof the U-Net encoder-decoders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 20:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

However, due to the limited dataset and the\ndependence on manual labeling data, DNNs often fail to detect their erroneous\nbehaviors, which may lead to serious problems. Several approaches have been\nproposed to enhance the input examples for testing DL systems. However, they\nhave the following limitations. First, they design and generate adversarial\nexamples from the perspective of model, which may cause low generalization\nability when they are applied to other models. Second, they only use surface\nfeature constraints to judge the difference between the adversarial example\ngenerated and the original example. The deep feature constraints, which contain\nhigh-level semantic information, such as image object category and scene\nsemantics are completely neglected. To address these two problems, in this\npaper, we propose CAGFuzz, a Coverage-guided Adversarial Generative Fuzzing\ntesting approach, which generates adversarial examples for a targeted DNN to\ndiscover its potential defects. First, we train an adversarial case generator\n(AEG) from the perspective of general data set. Second, we extract the depth\nfeatures of the original and adversarial examples, and constrain the\nadversarial examples by cosine similarity to ensure that the semantic\ninformation of adversarial examples remains unchanged. Finally, we retrain\neffective adversarial examples to improve neuron testing coverage rate. Based\non several popular data sets, we design a set of dedicated experiments to\nevaluate CAGFuzz. The experimental results show that CAGFuzz can improve the\nneuron coverage rate, detect hidden errors, and also improve the accuracy of\nthe target DNN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:32:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 02:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-22"}

The observations obtained with Metis aboard the Solar Orbiter\nESA-NASA observatory will enable us to diagnose, with unprecedented temporal\ncoverage and spatial resolution, the structures and dynamics of the full corona\nfrom 1.7 $R_\\odot$ to about 9 $R_\\odot$. Due to the uniqueness of the Solar\nOrbiter mission profile, Metis will be able to observe the solar corona from a\nclose vantage point (down to 0.28 AU), achieving out-of-ecliptic views with the\nincrease of the orbit inclination over time. Moreover, observations near\nperihelion, during the phase of lower rotational velocity of the solar surface\nrelative to the spacecraft, will allow longer-term studies of the coronal\nfeatures. Thanks to a novel occultation design and a combination of a UV\ninterference coating of the mirrors and a spectral bandpass filter, Metis\nimages the solar corona simultaneously in the visible light band, between 580\nand 640 nm, and in the UV H I Lyman-{\\alpha} line at 121.6 nm. The coronal\nimages in both the UV Lyman-{\\alpha} and polarised visible light are obtained\nat high spatial resolution with a spatial scale down to about 2000 km and 15000\nkm at perihelion, in the cases of the visible and UV light, respectively. A\ntemporal resolution down to 1 second can be achieved when observing coronal\nfluctuations in visible light. The Metis measurements will allow for complete\ncharacterisation of the main physical parameters and dynamics of the electron\nand neutral hydrogen/proton plasma components of the corona in the region where\nthe solar wind undergoes acceleration and where the onset and initial\npropagation of coronal mass ejections take place, thus significantly improving\nour understanding of the region connecting the Sun to the heliosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 13:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

Protons and neutrons are not\ndistinguished in order to simplify notations. The basic result is the rigorous\nmathematical proof that the bound eigenstates of the nuclei belong to the\nsubspace $P \\mathscr{H}$ spanned by the states of a single hole in the ground\nstate $\\psi_{0}$ of the parent nucleus with an extra nucleon, as in the\nuncorrelated models. This follows from the exponential decay of $\\psi_{0}$ when\na nucleon is very far apart from the residual nucleus. We prove that the real\ndifference from the uncorrelated models is that $P \\mathscr{H}$ has an infinite\ndimension and contains generalized single hole states, distinguishable from the\nusual ones by the fact that one cannot assign a wave function to the hole. The\nbound eigenstates of the nuclei are just states of this kind. Some physical\nconsequences are discussed, in particular the unexpected fact that the\ndynamical part of the single-hole Hamiltonian, although nonnull, does not\naffect the single-hole overlaps with the bound eigenstates. The decay of\n$\\psi_{0}$ provides the asymptotic behaviours of many single-hole quantities,\nin particular the nuclear density matrix.
