The firing threshold causes optimization issues, but they can be\novercome using a surrogate gradient. Here, we extend previous approaches in two\nways.

As a multilevel preconditioner, HILUCSI statically and\ndynamically permutes individual rows and columns to the next level for deferred\nfactorization. Unlike ILUPACK, HILUCSI applies symmetric preprocessing\ntechniques at the top levels but always uses unsymmetric preprocessing and\nunsymmetric factorization at the coarser levels. The deferring combined with\nmixed preprocessing enabled a unified treatment for nearly or partially\nsymmetric systems, and simplified the implementation by avoiding mixed $1\\times\n1$ and $2\\times 2$ pivots for symmetric indefinite systems. We show that this\ncombination improves robustness for indefinite systems without compromising\nefficiency. Furthermore, to enable superior efficiency for large-scale systems\nwith millions or more unknowns, HILUCSI introduces a scalability-oriented\ndropping in conjunction with a variant of inverse-based dropping. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of HILUCSI for dozens of benchmark problems,\nincluding those from the mixed formulation of the Poisson equation, Stokes\nequations, and Navier-Stokes equations. We also compare its performance with\nILUPACK, the supernodal ILUTP in SuperLU, and multithreaded direct solvers in\nPARDISO and MUMPS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 16:59:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 17:06:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 20:03:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 21:54:31 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 14:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-31"}

We find that\nthe influence of $\\lambda$ on out-of-sample prediction accuracy heavily depends\non $\\omega$.

The purpose of this study is\nto develop a machine-learning based classification method using radio-mic\nfeatures of multi-parametric MRI to classify high-grade gliomas (HGG) and\nlow-grade gliomas (LGG). Methods: Multi-parametric MRI of 80 patients, 40 HGG\nand 40 LGG, with gliomas from the MICCAI BRATs 2015 training database were used\nin this study. Each patient's T1, contrast-enhanced T1, T2, and Fluid\nAttenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MRIs as well as the tumor contours were\nprovided in the database. Using the given contours, radiomic features from all\nfour multi-parametric MRIs were extracted. Of these features, a feature\nselection process using two-sample T-test and least absolute shrinkage,\nselection operator (LASSO), and a feature correlation threshold was applied to\nvarious combinations of T1, contrast-enhanced T1, T2, and FLAIR MRIs\nseparately. These selected features were then used to train, test, and\ncross-validate a random forest to differentiate HGG and LGG. Finally, the\nclassification accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate\nthe classification method. Results: Optimized parameters showed that on\naverage, the overall accuracy of our classification method was 0.913 or 73 out\nof 80 correct classifications, 36/40 for HGG and 37/40 for LGG, with an AUC of\n0.956 based on the combination with FLAIR, T1, T1c and T2 MRIs.

The singlet ground-state is studied, as well as the doublet\nmixed quantum state obtained by extracting an electron from the system.

We\nshow the ability of PNOF7 to describe strong correlation effects in these 2D\nsystems by comparing our results with exact diagonalization, density matrix\nrenormalization group (DMRG), and auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo\ncalculations. PNOF7 overcomes variational 2RDM methods with two- and\nthree-index positivity N-representability conditions, reducing computational\ncost to mean-field scaling. Consistent results are obtained for small and large\nsystems up to 144 electrons, weak and strong correlation regimes, and many\nfilling situations.

Traditional\naccess control mechanisms consider one unique trusted user that controls the\naccess to the devices. However, multi-user multi-device smart home settings\npose fundamentally different challenges to traditional single-user systems. For\ninstance, in a multi-user environment, users have conflicting, complex, and\ndynamically changing demands on multiple devices, which cannot be handled by\ntraditional access control techniques. To address these challenges, in this\npaper, we introduce Kratos, a novel multiuser and multi-device-aware access\ncontrol mechanism that allows smart home users to flexibly specify their access\ncontrol demands. Kratos has three main components: user interaction module,\nbackend server, and policy manager. Users can specify their desired access\ncontrol settings using the interaction module which are translated into access\ncontrol policies in the backend server. The policy manager analyzes these\npolicies and initiates negotiation between users to resolve conflicting demands\nand generates final policies. We implemented Kratos and evaluated its\nperformance on real smart home deployments featuring multi-user scenarios with\na rich set of configurations (309 different policies including 213 demand\nconflicts and 24 restriction policies).

Best subset selection (BS) is known to be NP-hard and has\na computational cost that grows exponentially with the number of predictors.\nRecently, Bertsimas (2016) formulated BS as a mixed integer optimization (MIO)\nproblem and largely reduced the computation overhead by using a well-developed\noptimization solver, but the current methodology is not scalable to very large\ndatasets. In this paper, we propose a novel LS-based method, the best\northogonalized subset selection (BOSS) method, which performs BS upon an\northogonalized basis of ordered predictors and scales easily to large problem\nsizes. Another challenge in applying LS-based methods in practice is the\nselection rule to choose the optimal subset size k. Cross-validation (CV)\nrequires fitting a procedure multiple times, and results in a selected k that\nis random across repeated application to the same dataset. Compared to CV,\ninformation criteria only require fitting a procedure once, but they require\nknowledge of the effective degrees of freedom for the fitting procedure, which\nis generally not available analytically for complex methods. Since BOSS uses\northogonalized predictors, we first explore a connection for orthogonal\nnon-random predictors between BS and its Lagrangian formulation (i.e.,\nminimization of the residual sum of squares plus the product of a\nregularization parameter and k), and based on this connection propose a\nheuristic degrees of freedom (hdf) for BOSS that can be estimated via an\nanalytically-based expression. We show in both simulations and real data\nanalysis that BOSS using a proposed Kullback-Leibler based information\ncriterion AICc-hdf has the strongest performance of all of the LS-based methods\nconsidered and is competitive with regularization methods, with the\ncomputational effort of a single ordinary LS fit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 18:54:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 05:00:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2021 03:46:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

We propose a new\nmotion correction pipeline using an omnibus regression model that avoids this\nproblem by simultaneously regressing out multiple artifacts using the best\nperforming algorithms to estimate each artifact. We quantitatively evaluate its\nmotion artifact suppression performance against sequential regression pipelines\nusing a large heterogeneous dataset (n=151) which includes high-motion subjects\nand multiple disease phenotypes. The proposed concatenated regression pipeline\nsignificantly reduces the association between head motion and functional\nconnectivity while significantly outperforming the traditional sequential\nregression pipelines in eliminating distance-dependent head motion artifacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 19:42:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 22:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-23"}

So far, most studies of\ninterstellar atoms assumed that daughter hydrogen atoms directly inherit the\nkinetic properties of parent protons. This assumption neglects angular\nscattering of the interacting particles. However, for low relative velocities,\nas expected for charge exchanges in the outer heliosheath, this scattering is\nsignificant. In this study, we present how the parameters of daughter\npopulations depend on the relative velocity and temperatures of parent\npopulations. For this purpose, we numerically compute collision terms with and\nwithout this scattering. We find that the secondary population of interstellar\nhydrogen atoms, for the parent populations with the relative bulk velocity of\n20 km s$^{-1}$ and equal temperatures of 7500 K, has ~2 km s$^{-1}$ higher bulk\nvelocity if the scattering is taken into account. Additionally, temperatures\nare higher by ~2400 K and ~1200 K in parallel and perpendicular direction to\nthe relative motion of parent populations, respectively. Moreover, a\nsignificant departure of secondary atoms from the Maxwell-Boltzmann\ndistribution is expected for high relative velocities of parent populations.\nThis process affects the distribution and density of interstellar atoms in the\nheliosphere and production of pickup ions. Thus, we show that angular\nscattering in charge exchange collisions is important to include in analyses of\ninterstellar neutral atoms and pickup ions observed at 1 au and in the outer\nheliosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 19:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Most of these methods do not explicitly reason\nbeyond the visible pixels in the images. To address the limitations of these\nmethods, we propose a framework ViewSynth, to jointly learn: (1) viewpoint\ninvariant keypoint-descriptor from depth images using a proposed Contrastive\nMatching Loss, and (2) view synthesis of depth images from different viewpoints\nusing the proposed View Synthesis Module and View Synthesis Loss. By learning\nview synthesis, we explicitly encourage the feature extractor to encode\ninformation about not only the visible, but also the occluded parts of the\nscene.

In this work, we\nleverage the many benefits of the micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)\ndevices to fabricate a small, low power, inexpensive sensor whose resolution is\nin the range of weak biomagnetic fields. The sensor works at room temperature,\nand is suitable for consumer electronics integration. At present, such\nbiomagnetic fields can only be measured by expensive mechanisms such as optical\npumping and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). Thus, our\nsensor suggests the opening of a large phase space for medical and consumer\napplications. The prototype fabrication is achieved by assembling\nmicro-objects, including a permanent micromagnet, onto a post-release\ncommercial MEMS accelerometer.

Due to limitations on data collection,\ntransmission, and storage, real-world MTS data usually contains missing values,\nmaking it infeasible to apply existing MTS forecasting models such as linear\nregression and recurrent neural networks. Though many efforts have been devoted\nto this problem, most of them solely rely on local dependencies for imputing\nmissing values, which ignores global temporal dynamics. Local\ndependencies/patterns would become less useful when the missing ratio is high,\nor the data have consecutive missing values; while exploring global patterns\ncan alleviate such problems. Thus, jointly modeling local and global temporal\ndynamics is very promising for MTS forecasting with missing values. However,\nwork in this direction is rather limited. Therefore, we study a novel problem\nof MTS forecasting with missing values by jointly exploring local and global\ntemporal dynamics.

To address these\nproblems, we propose a Domain-Adaptive Density Clustering (DADC) algorithm,\nwhich consists of three steps: domain-adaptive density measurement, cluster\ncenter self-identification, and cluster self-ensemble. For data with VDD\nfeatures, clusters in sparse regions are often neglected by using uniform\ndensity peak thresholds, which results in the loss of sparse clusters. We\ndefine a domain-adaptive density measurement method based on K-Nearest\nNeighbors (KNN) to adaptively detect the density peaks of different density\nregions.

Since the weighted Laplacian strategy\ninherits the virtues of spectral methods, graph algorithms designed using\nweighted Laplacian will necessarily possess more robust theoretical guarantees\nfor algorithmic performances, comparing with those existing algorithms that are\nheuristically proposed. In order to illustrate its powerful utility both in\ntheory and in practice, we also present two effective applications of our\nweighted Laplacian method to multilevel graph partitioning and balanced minimum\ncut problem, respectively.

We\nhere propose to model the dynamic process of iterative interactive image\nsegmentation as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it with reinforcement\nlearning (RL). Unfortunately, it is intractable to use single-agent RL for\nvoxel-wise prediction due to the large exploration space. To reduce the\nexploration space to a tractable size, we treat each voxel as an agent with a\nshared voxel-level behavior strategy so that it can be solved with multi-agent\nreinforcement learning. An additional advantage of this multi-agent model is to\ncapture the dependency among voxels for segmentation task. Meanwhile, to enrich\nthe information of previous segmentations, we reserve the prediction\nuncertainty in the state space of MDP and derive an adjustment action space\nleading to a more precise and finer segmentation.

After a brief presentation of PCOM\nand endowing it with the information interpretation, we analyze its\ncomputational counterpart. The main implication of PCOM is that by using the\nquantum representation of probability, one need not compute the joint\nprobability distribution (jpd) for observables involved in the process of\ncomputation. Jpd's calculation is exponentially time consuming. Consequently,\nclassical probabilistic algorithms involving calculation of jpd for $n$ random\nvariables can be over-performed by quantum algorithms (for big values of $n).$\nQuantum algorithms are based on quantum probability calculus.

We also\nstress the role the basic feature of the genuine quantum superposition\ncomparing with the classical wave superposition: generation of discrete events\nin measurements on superposition states.

Among the\nother things, it helped us build the standard model. However, it also showed\nimportant limitations. For example, it failed to restrict the gauge group and\nthe matter sector in a powerful way. After discussing its effectiveness, we\nupgrade it to make room for quantum gravity. The unitarity assumption is better\nunderstood, since it allows for the presence of physical particles as well as\nfake particles (fakeons). The locality assumption is applied to an interim\nclassical action, since the true classical action is nonlocal and emerges from\nthe quantization and a later process of classicization.

This is far away from practical semantic segmentation tasks\nwhere the K-way setting (K>1) is usually required by performing the accurate\nmulti-object segmentation. To deal with this issue, we formulate the few-shot\nsemantic segmentation task as a learning-based pixel classification problem and\npropose a novel framework called MetaSegNet based on meta-learning.

We propose a method where the\nover-complete molecular basis set is pruned by a pivoted Cholesky decomposition\nof the overlap matrix, yielding an optimal low-rank approximation that is\nnumerically stable; the pivot indices determining a reduced basis set that is\ncomplete enough to describe all the basis functions in the original\nover-complete basis.

In this paper, we develop a general multiscale Burton-Cabrera-Frank\n(BCF) type model of the vertical growth of 2D materials to predict the\nnecessary growth conditions for vertical versus in-plane (monolayer) growth of\narbitrarily-shaped layers. This extends previous work where we developed such a\nmodel assuming the layers were fully-faceted (Ye et al., ACS Nano, 11,\n12780-12788, 2017). To solve the model numerically, we reformulate the system\nusing the phase-field/diffuse domain method that enables the equations to be\nsolved in a fixed regular domain. We use a second-order accurate, adaptive\nfinite-difference/nonlinear multigrid algorithm to discretize and solve the\ndiscrete system. We investigate the effect of parameters, including the van der\nWaals interaction energies between the layers, the kinetic attachment rates,\nthe edge-energies and the deposition flux, on layer growth and morphologies.\nWhile the conditions that favor vertical growth generally follow an analytic\nthermodynamic criterion we derived for circular layers, the layer boundaries\nmay develop significant curvature during growth, consistent with experimental\nobservations. Our approach provides a mechanistic framework for controlling and\noptimizing the growth multilayered 2D materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 19:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

It further\nrecurrently exploits the reconstructed results and intermediate features of a\nsequence of preceding frames to improve the initial super-resolution of the\ncurrent frame by modelling the coherence of structural facial features across\nframes.

Standard methods for directly measuring power availability are\ncomplex, often inaccurate, and are prone to attack. This paper explores an\nalternative approach to identifying power outages through intelligent\nmonitoring of IP address availability. In finding these outages, we explore the\ntrade-off between the accuracy of detection and false alarms.\n  We begin by experimentally demonstrating that static, residential Internet\nconnections serve as good indicators of power, as they are mostly active unless\npower fails and rarely have battery backups. We construct metrics that\ndynamically score the reliability of each residential IP, where a higher score\nindicates a higher correlation between that IP's availability and its regional\npower. We monitor specifically selected subsets of residential IPs and evaluate\nthe accuracy with which they can indicate current county power status.\n  Using data gathered during the power outages caused by Hurricane Florence, we\ndemonstrate that we can track power outages at different granularities, state\nand county, in both sparse and dense regions. By comparing our detection with\nthe reports gathered from power utility companies, we achieve an average\ndetection accuracy of $90\\%$, where we also show some of our false alarms and\nmissed outage events could be due to imperfect ground truth data. Therefore,\nour method can be used as a complementary technique of power outage detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 18:59:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

We propose to use a less resource\ndemanding non-learning method, guided by a learning-based model, to handle\nhigh-resolution images and achieve accurate stereo reconstruction. The\ndeep-learning model produces an initial disparity prediction with uncertainty\nfor each pixel of the down-sampled stereo image pair. The uncertainty serves as\na self-measurement of its generalization ability and the per-pixel searching\nrange around the initially predicted disparity.

However, nodes in real world networks tend\nto interact through several distinct channels. Simple aggregation or ignorance\nof this multiplexity will lead to misleading results. On the other hand, there\nexists redundant information between different interaction patterns between\nnodes. Recent research reveals the analogy between the community structure and\nthe hyperbolic coordinate. To learn each node's effective embedding\nrepresentation while reducing the redundancy of multiplex network, we then\npropose a unified framework combing multiplex network hyperbolic embedding and\nmultiplex community detection. The intuitive rationale is that high order node\nembedding approach is expected to alleviate the observed network's sparse and\nnoisy structure which will benefit the community detection task. On the\ncontrary, the improved community structure will also guide the node embedding\ntask. To incorporate the common features between channels while preserving\nunique features, a random walk approach which traversing in latent multiplex\nhyperbolic space is proposed to detect the community across channels and bridge\nthe connection between node embedding and community detection. The proposed\nframework is evaluated on several network tasks using different real world\ndataset. The results demonstrates that our framework is effective and\nefficiency compared with state-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2019 10:39:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 2019 17:23:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 30 Oct 2021 14:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}
