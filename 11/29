Our model assumes an initial core growth dominated by pebble\naccretion, and a second growth phase that is characterized by a moderate\naccretion of both planetesimals and gas. The third phase is dominated by\nrunaway gas accretion during which the planet becomes detached from the disk.\nThe second and third phases are computed in detail, considering two different\nprescriptions for the planetesimal accretion and fits from hydrodynamical\nstudies to compute the gas accretion in the detached phase. In order for\nJupiter to consist of $\\sim$20-40 $M_{\\oplus}$ of heavy elements as suggested\nby structure models, we find that Jupiter's formation location is preferably at\nan orbital distance of $1\\lesssim a \\lesssim 10$ au once the accretion of\nplanetesimals dominates. We find that Jupiter could accrete between $\\sim$1 and\n$\\sim$15 $M_{\\oplus}$ of heavy elements during runaway gas accretion, depending\non the assumed initial surface density of planetesimals and the prescription\nused to estimate the heavy-element accretion during the final stage of the\nplanetary formation. This would yield an envelope metallicity of $\\sim$0.5 to\n$\\sim$3 times solar. By computing the solid accretion during the detached\nphase, we infer a planetary mass-metallicity ($M_P$-$M_Z$) relation of $M_Z\n\\sim M_P^{2/5}$ when a gap in the planetesimal disk is created, and of $M_Z\n\\sim M_P^{1/6}$ without a planetesimal gap. Our hybrid pebble-planetesimal\nmodel can account for Jupiter's bulk and atmospheric enrichment. The high bulk\nmetallicity inferred for many giant exoplanets is difficult to explain from\nstandard formation models. This might suggest a migration history for such\nhighly enriched giant exoplanets and/or giant impacts after the disk's\ndispersal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 16:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

The main goals of this study are to obtain independent constraints\non the density, and ultimately on the distance of the obscuring gas, as well as\nto characterise the impact of variable obscuration on the observed X-ray\nspectral-timing characteristics of Seyfert galaxies.

We carried out a\ncomparative analysis of NGC 3783 during unobscured (using archival 2000-2001\nXMM-Newton data) and obscured states (using XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data from the\n2016 observational campaign).

Predicting tumor\nbehavior enables the creation of risk profiles for patients and the\noptimisation of their treatment by therapeutically targeting sub-clones more\nlikely to grow. Current research efforts in this space are focused on\nmathematical modelling of population genetics to quantify the selective\nadvantage of sub-clones, thus enabling predictions of which sub-clones are more\nlikely to grow.

From this\nperspective, randomness of the limit bootstrap measure is regarded as a failure\nof the bootstrap. We show that such limiting randomness does not necessarily\ninvalidate bootstrap inference if validity is understood as control over the\nfrequency of correct inferences in large samples. We first establish sufficient\nconditions for asymptotic bootstrap validity in cases where the unconditional\nlimit distribution of a statistic can be obtained by averaging a (random)\nlimiting bootstrap distribution. Further, we provide results ensuring the\nasymptotic validity of the bootstrap as a tool for conditional inference, the\nleading case being that where a bootstrap distribution estimates consistently a\nconditional (and thus, random) limit distribution of a statistic.

Real-world applications often involve a mixture\nof different data types such as key-value pairs, where the frequency of keys\nand mean of values under each key must be estimated simultaneously. For\nkey-value data collection with LDP, it is challenging to achieve a good\nutility-privacy tradeoff since the data contains two dimensions and a user may\npossess multiple key-value pairs. There is also an inherent correlation between\nkey and values which if not harnessed, will lead to poor utility. In this\npaper, we propose a locally differentially private key-value data collection\nframework that utilizes correlated perturbations to enhance utility. We\ninstantiate our framework by two protocols PCKV-UE (based on Unary Encoding)\nand PCKV-GRR (based on Generalized Randomized Response), where we design an\nadvanced Padding-and-Sampling mechanism and an improved mean estimator which is\nnon-interactive. Due to our correlated key and value perturbation mechanisms,\nthe composed privacy budget is shown to be less than that of independent\nperturbation of key and value, which enables us to further optimize the\nperturbation parameters via budget allocation. Experimental results on both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets show that our proposed protocols achieve\nbetter utility for both frequency and mean estimations under the same LDP\nguarantees than state-of-the-art mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 19:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-02"}

Therefore, a practical three-stage\nhybrid analogue-digital precoding architecture, occupying fewer RF chains, is\nproposed aiming for a non-orthogonal IoT signal in low-cost multiuser MIMO\nsystems. The non-orthogonal waveform can flexibly save spectral resources for\nmassive devices connections or improve data rate without consuming extra\nspectral resources. The hybrid precoding is divided into three stages including\nanalogue-domain, digital-domain and waveform-domain. A codebook based beam\nselection simplifies the analogue-domain beamforming via phase-only tuning.\nDigital-domain precoding can fine-tune the codebook shaped beam and resolve\nmultiuser interference in terms of both signal amplitude and phase.

Results reveal that waveform precoding\naccuracy can be enhanced by hybrid precoding. Compared to a transmitter with\nthe same RF chain resources, hybrid precoding significantly outperforms fully\ndigital precoding by up to 15.6 dB error vector magnitude (EVM) gain. A fully\ndigital system with the same number of antennas clearly requires more RF chains\nand therefore is low power-, space- and cost- efficient.

The external trigger is then\nreconfigured to tag cosmic ray muons passing through the active TMS volume,\nwhich are used to measure the stopping power in TMS and the electron lifetime\nin the detector. We find a most-probable energy loss from minimum ionising\nparticles (MIPs) of $\\Delta_p/ds$ = (0.60$\\pm$0.01) MeV/cm. We also derive an\nelectron lifetime of 43$^{+680}_{-21}~\\mu$s by measuring the most-probable\nenergy loss as a function of drift time. For both fast electron and muon\nsignals, the PMT detects prompt Cherenkov light, demonstrating the possibility\nof random triggering. The room-temperature organic target medium, together with\nthe self-triggering capabilities and long electron lifetimes reported in this\nwork, make this an attractive technology to further explore for rare event\ndetectors or other applications in the area of radiation measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 22:44:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 19:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

The impact of several key parameters on the\nsystem's secrecy e.g., transmit power of the sources, number of eavesdroppers,\nmaximum tolerated interference power, and the number of diversity branches is\ninvestigated. Importantly, by considering two scenarios, namely (i) absence and\n(ii) presence of a friendly jammer, new insights are obtained for the\nconsidered communication system.

Our analysis and\nresults show that the use of a polarizer in front of the camera is not only a\nseparate technique, but it can be seen as an enhancement technique for more\nadvanced forms of passive NLOS imaging.

Payment\nchannels have been extended to the payment network, through which users can\nutilize existing channels as intermediary links to route coins to others.\nHowever, routing payments through multiple channels bears nontrivial overheads.\nIt requires every intermediary channel to lock a portion of its available\ncapacity until the payment is settled. This may lead to deadlock in a\nconcurrent situation. The intermediary nodes in a payment path may also charge\nfees for routing a payment. The longer the routing path, the more serious the\nabove problems.\n  In this paper, we design and develop a novel off-chain system to shorten the\nrouting path for the payment network. In particular, we propose the channel\nhub, which is an extension of the payment hub, to allows transferring coins\ndirectly from one payment channel to another within the same hub. That is, the\nchannel hub can be viewed as a shortcut device for the underlying payment\nnetwork. We design a new protocol named Boros to perform secure off-chain\ncross-channel transfers through the channel hub.

Traditional TEP model does not utilize the\nflexibility in the transmission network that is considered as static assets.\nHowever, as the load profile may have different seasonal patterns, the optimal\nnetwork configuration could be very different for different seasons in the\nplanning horizon. Therefore, this paper proposes to incorporate seasonal\nnetwork optimization (SNO) into the traditional TEP model. SNO dynamically\noptimizes the network for each season of each planning epoch. Two TEP-SNO\nmodels are proposed to investigate the benefits of optimizing the status of (i)\nexisting branches, and (ii) existing and new branches, respectively. Numerical\nsimulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TEP-SNO models. It is\nshown that SNO can improve system operational efficiency, defer investment of\nnew transmission elements, and reduce the total cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 06:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-02"}

How users with\nheterogeneous preferences cooperate in coded caching and how to calculate the\nresulting caching gains are still open problems. In this paper, a two-phase\ncache-aided network is investigated, in which users with heterogeneous\npreferences are served by a base station through a shared link. Effective\nthroughput is considered as a performance metric. It is proved that the\nachievable domain of effective throughputs is a convex set and can be\ncharacterized by its boundary. A special type of caching schemes, named uncoded\nplacement absolutely-fair (UPAF) caching, is studied. For the two-user case,\ngames are formulated to allocate effective throughput gains for the two users.\nFor the general multiuser case, a UPAF policy is proposed to organize user\ncooperation.

A growing planet embedded in a disk induces\nthree-dimensional (3D) gas flow, which may influence pebble accretion. In this\nstudy, we investigate the influence of the 3D planet-induced gas flow on pebble\naccretion. Assuming a non-isothermal, inviscid gas disk, we perform 3D\nhydrodynamical simulations on the spherical polar grid. Then we numerically\nintegrate the equation of motion of pebbles in 3D using hydrodynamical\nsimulations data. We find that the trajectories of pebbles in the\nplanet-induced gas flow differ significantly from those in the unperturbed\nshear flow for a wide range of pebble sizes investigated (${\\rm\nSt}=10^{-3}$--$10^{0}$, where ${\\rm St}$ is the Stokes number). The horseshoe\nflow and outflow of the gas alter the motion of the pebbles, which leads to the\nreduction of the width of the accretion window, $w_{\\rm acc}$, and the\naccretion cross section, $A_{\\rm acc}$. On the other hand, the changes in\ntrajectories also cause an increase in relative velocity of pebbles to the\nplanet, which offsets the reduction of $w_{\\rm acc}$ and $A_{\\rm acc}$. As a\nconsequence, in the Stokes regime, the accretion probability of pebbles,\n$P_{\\rm acc}$, in the planet-induced gas flow is comparable to that in the\nunperturbed shear flow except when the Stokes number is small, ${\\rm\nSt}\\sim10^{-3}$, in 2D accretion, or when the thermal mass of the planet is\nsmall, $m=0.03$ in 3D accretion. In contrast, in the Epstein regime, $P_{\\rm\nacc}$ in the planet-induced gas flow becomes smaller than that in the shear\nflow in the Stokes regime in both 2D and 3D accretion, regardless of assumed\n${\\rm St}$ and $m$. Our results suggest that the 3D planet-induced gas flow may\nbe helpful to explain the distribution of exoplanets as well as the\narchitecture of the solar system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 08:36:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

In this paper, we work towards addressing this\nissue by analyzing abstract argumentation from the perspective of the rational\nman paradigm in microeconomic theory. To assess under which conditions abstract\nargumentation-based decision-making can be considered economically rational, we\nderive reference independence as a non-monotonic inference property from a\nformal model of economic rationality and create a new argumentation principle\nthat ensures compliance with this property. We then compare the reference\nindependence principle with other reasoning principles, in particular with\ncautious monotony and rational monotony. We show that the argumentation\nsemantics as proposed in Dung's seminal paper, as well as other semantics we\nevaluate -- with the exception of naive semantics and the SCC-recursive CF2\nsemantics -- violate the reference independence principle. Consequently, we\ninvestigate how structural properties of argumentation frameworks impact the\nreference independence principle, and identify cyclic expansions (both even and\nodd cycles) as the root of the problem. Finally, we put reference independence\ninto the context of preference-based argumentation and show that for this\nargumentation variant, which explicitly models preferences, reference\nindependence cannot be ensured in a straight-forward manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 09:51:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 23:03:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 15:47:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 19:28:17 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 20:08:02 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 12:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-11"}

However, common techniques to support direct control interfaces in\nVEs feature constraints that make it difficult to use those methods in cramped\nhome environments.

In this process, it is\nrelevant to understand how the adhesions between cells that form the\nendothelial monolayer are broken, resulting in intra-cellular gaps through\nwhich tumor cells are able to extravasate the blood vessel wall.\n  Within this process, we focus on studying the dynamics of cell-cell junctions\nrupture produced in the endothelial monolayer by the effect of Calcium waves.\nThe regulation of this monolayer is of vital importance, not only in\nmetastasis, but also in diseases such as pulmonary edema or atherosclerosis.\n  In order to understand this rupture dynamics in greater depth, we propose a\nhybrid model that simulates endothelial cells as \\textcolor{black}{an} elastic\nmaterial and cell-cell adhesions of the monolayer by means of a catch bond law.\n  We study the effects that the cell contraction caused by a Calcium wave\npresents on the endothelial monolayer depending on the diameter of the blood\nvessel. For this purpose, we develop a three-dimensional model to study the\neffect of the different blood vessel diameters.\n  The results indicate that there are greater tractions on the joints located\nin vertices common to several cells. This led to the formation of openings in\nthe endothelial monolayer, through which extravasation of tumor cells could\noccur. For the different geometries studied, no significant effect of the blood\nvessel diameter on the rupture of the adhesions of monolayer is observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 10:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-02"}

The\nsignificance of buoyancy is quantified by the Rayleigh number Ra which is the\nbuoyancy force over the viscous damping force. In this study, Ra spans almost\nfour decades from 0.1 to 400. We focus on how the mass flux, characterized by\nthe Sherwood number Sh, and the flow morphologies depend on Ra. For single\ndroplet dissolution, we first show the transition of the Sh(Ra) scaling from a\nconstant value to $Sh\\sim Ra^{1/4}$, which confirms the experimental results by\nDietrich et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 794, 2016, pp. 45--67). The two distinct\nregimes, namely the diffusively- and the convectively-dominated regime, exhibit\ndifferent flow morphologies: when Ra>=10, a buoyant plume is clearly visible\nwhich contrasts sharply to the pure diffusion case at low Ra. For multiple\ndroplet dissolution, the well-known shielding effect comes into play at low Ra\nso that the dissolution rate is slower as compared to the single droplet case.\nHowever, at high Ra, convection becomes more and more dominant so that a\ncollective plume enhances the mass flux, and remarkably the multiple droplets\ndissolve faster than a single droplet. This has also been found in the\nexperiments by Laghezza et al. (Soft Matter, vol. 12, 2016, pp. 5787--5796). We\nexplain this enhancement by the formation of a single, larger plume rather than\nseveral individual plumes. Moreover, there is an optimal Ra at which the\nenhancement is maximized, because the single plume is narrower at larger Ra,\nwhich thus hinders the enhancement. Our findings demonstrate a new mechanism in\ncollective droplet dissolution, which is the merging of the plumes, that leads\nto non-trivial phenomena, contrasting the shielding effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 10:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

For all these transmission schemes, we aim for jointly\noptimizing the blocklength and power allocation to minimize the decoding error\nprobability of the actuator subject to the reliability requirement of the\nrobot, the total energy constraints, as well as the latency constraints. We\nfurther develop low-complexity algorithms to address the optimization problems\nfor each transmission scheme. { For the general case with more than two\ndevices, we also develop a low-complexity efficient algorithm for the OMA\nscheme.} Our results show that the relay-assisted transmission significantly\noutperforms the OMA scheme, while NOMA scheme performs well when the\nblocklength is very limited. We further show that the relay-assisted\ntransmission has superior performance over the C-NOMA scheme due to larger\nfeasible region of the former scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 10:54:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-02"}

Despite these high expectation, the\neffectiveness and efficiency of existing NAS solutions are unclear, with some\nrecent works going so far as to suggest that many existing NAS solutions are no\nbetter than random architecture selection. The inefficiency of NAS solutions\nmay be attributed to inaccurate architecture evaluation. Specifically, to speed\nup NAS, recent works have proposed under-training different candidate\narchitectures in a large search space concurrently by using shared network\nparameters; however, this has resulted in incorrect architecture ratings and\nfurthered the ineffectiveness of NAS.\n  In this work, we propose to modularize the large search space of NAS into\nblocks to ensure that the potential candidate architectures are fully trained;\nthis reduces the representation shift caused by the shared parameters and leads\nto the correct rating of the candidates. Thanks to the block-wise search, we\ncan also evaluate all of the candidate architectures within a block.

In the first task, I compare three popular\ngroups of lexicon generation methods: dictionary-, corpus-, and\nword-embedding-based ones, finding that dictionary-based systems generally\nyield better lexicons than the last two groups.

The consideration of linearized perturbations\nusually leads to a master wave equation with effective potential which can then\nbe analyzed using standard tools from quantum mechanics. However, in the\nwormhole case, particular care must be taken with the gauge conditions when\nformulating the master equation. A poor coordinate choice, based for example on\nfixing the areal radial coordinate, may lead to singularities at the throat\nwhich complicate the stability analysis or might even lead to erroneous\nconclusions regarding the stability of the underlying wormhole configuration.\nIn this work, we present a general method for deriving a gauge-invariant wave\nsystem of linearized perturbation equations in the spherically symmetric case,\nassuming that the matter supporting the wormhole is a phantom scalar field,\nthat is, a self-interacting scalar field whose kinetic energy has the reversed\nsign. We show how this system can be decoupled and reduced to a single master\nwave equation with a regular potential, with no intermediate steps involving\nsingularities at the throat. Two applications of our formalism are given.\nFirst, we rederive the master equation for the linearly perturbed\nEllis-Bronnikov wormhole using our new, singularity-free method. Second, we\nderive the master equation describing the linear perturbations of a certain\nAnti de Sitter wormhole, provide a detailed analysis of the spectral properties\nof the underlying operator and prove that this wormhole is linearly unstable.\nIn the final part of the paper, we consider a wormhole with de Sitter-type\nends, whose spacetime presents horizons and admits a nonstatic extension beyond\nthem; for this system we derive partial results of linear instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 13:30:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 03:20:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-10"}

The X-ray spectra of HLX-1 in quiescence can be described\nwith a single power-law model while the thermal component dominates the X-ray\nemission during outburst.

The procedure uses the\ninstrumental lines present in all observations, in particular, Cu-Ka. By\nstudying their spatial and temporal variations, in addition to incorporating\ncalibration observations, we refined the absolute energy scale to better than\n150 km/s at the Fe-K line, a large improvement over the nominal accuracy of 550\nkm/s. We then mapped the bulk motions over much of the central 1200 and 800 kpc\nof Perseus and Coma, respectively, in spatial regions down to 65 and 140 kpc\nsize. We cross-checked our procedure by comparing our measurements with those\nfound in Perseus by Hitomi for an overlapping region, finding consistent\nresults. For Perseus, there is a LoS velocity increase of 480+-210 km/s\n(1sigma) 250 kpc east of the nucleus. This region is associated with a cold\nfront, providing direct evidence of the ICM sloshing in the potential well.\nAssuming the intrinsic distribution of bulk motions is Gaussian, its width is\n214+-85 km/s, excluding systematics. Removing the sloshing region, this is\nreduced to 20-150 km/s, which is similar in magnitude to the Hitomi line width\nmeasurements in undisturbed regions.

We propose an automatic method to\ninfer the 3D pose of a single bending section instrument, using only the images\nprovided by a monocular camera embedded at the tip of the endoscope. The\nproposed method relies on colored markers attached onto the bending section.\nThe image of the instrument is segmented using a graph-based method and the\ncorners of the markers are extracted by detecting the color transition along\nB{\\'e}zier curves fitted on edge points.

Even nowadays, the origin of carbon and the relative\nimportance of massive and low- to intermediate-mass stars in producing it is\nstill a matter of debate. In this paper we aim at better understanding the\norigin of carbon by studying the trends of [C/H], [C/Fe],and [C/Mg] versus\n[Fe/H], and [Mg/H] for 2133 FGK dwarf stars from the fifth Gaia-ESO Survey\ninternal data release (GES iDR5). The availability of accurate parallaxes and\nproper motions from Gaia DR2 and radial velocities from GES iDR5 allows us to\ncompute Galactic velocities, orbits and absolute magnitudes and, for 1751\nstars, ages via a Bayesian approach. Three different selection methodologies\nhave been adopted to discriminate between thin and thick disk stars. In all the\ncases, the two stellar groups show different abundance ratios, [C/H], [C/Fe],\nand [C/Mg], and span different age intervals, with the thick disk stars being,\non average, older than those in the thin disk. The behaviours of [C/H], [C/Fe],\nand [C/Mg] versus [Fe/H], [Mg/H], and age all suggest that C is primarily\nproduced in massive stars like Mg. The increase of [C/Mg] for young thin disk\nstars indicates a contribution from low-mass stars or the increased C\nproduction from massive stars at high metallicities due to the enhanced mass\nloss. The analysis of the orbital parameters Rmed and |Zmax| support an\n\"inside-out\" and \"upside-down\" formation scenario for the disks of Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 14:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

This\ninstrument is based on two 316-pixel arrays of Kinetic Inductance Detectors\n(KID) cooled to 150 mK by a custom dilution refrigerator-based cryostat. By\nusing Ti-Al and Al absorbers, we can cover a wide frequency range between 80\nand 300 GHz. In order to preserve a large instantaneous Field of View (FoV) 1\ndegree the spectrometer is based on a Fourier Transform interferometer. This\nrepresents a technological challenge due to the fast scanning speed that is\nneeded to overcome the effects of background atmospheric fluctuations. KISS is\ninstalled at the QUIJOTE 2.25 m telescope in Tenerife since February 2019 and\nis currently in its commissioning phase. In this proceeding we present an\noverview of the instrument and the latest results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 15:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

The existing blockchain protocol cannot accommodate peer-to-peer\n\"lottery\" micropayments at least without the need to create payment channels,\nwhich is analysed in the paper. Therefore, the implementation required the\ndevelopment of an update to the blockchain core. In the result, RandpayUTXO was\nintroduced - infinitely spendable zero output that requires the payee's\nsignature to be published in the blockchain. Randpay is considered to be the\nfirst blockchain protocol to require the payee to sign the transaction by their\nprivate key. This is a significant feature to improve not only\nmicrotransactions but also extend the use of the blockchain for legal deeds\nthat require a payee's consent to be recognised in legal applications.

They\nremain active when humans are active. Their activity levels are affected\nsignificantly by age class and time of the day. Multivariate analysis revealed\nthe presence of certain behavioural clusters on the basis of time of the day\nand energy expenditure in the behaviours. In addition, we provide a detailed\nethogram of free-ranging dogs. This, to our knowledge, is the first study of\nthis kind, which might be used to further study the eco-ethology of these dogs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 15:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-12"}
