Speculative execution, an\nessential processor optimization, and a source of such variances, can cause\nsevere detriment on deliberate branch mispredictions. Despite static analysis\ncould qualitatively verify the timing-leakage-free property under speculative\nexecution, it is incapable of producing endorsements including inputs and\nspeculated flows to diagnose leaks in depth. This work proposes a new symbolic\nexecution based method, SpecuSym, for precisely detecting cache timing leaks\nintroduced by speculative execution. Given a program (leakage-free in\nnon-speculative execution), SpecuSymsystematically explores the program state\nspace, models speculative behavior at conditional branches, and accumulates the\ncache side effects along with subsequent path explorations. During the dynamic\nexecution, SpecuSymconstructs leak predicates for memory visits according to\nthe specified cache model and conducts a constraint-solving based cache\nbehavior analysis to inspect the new cache behaviors. We have\nimplementedSpecuSymatop KLEE and evaluated it against 15 open-source\nbenchmarks.

Presently this approach, based on the\nnotion of a fluctuating on-site density matrix (OSDM), is developed for the\ncase of extended Falicov-Kimball model (EFKM). In an EFKM, an excitonic\ninsulator phase can be stabilised at zero temperature. With increasing\ntemperature, the excitonic order parameter (interaction-induced hybridisation\non-site, characterised by the absolute value and phase) eventually becomes\ndisordered, which involves fluctuations of both its phase and (at higher T) its\nabsolute value. In order to build an adequate finite-temperature description,\nit is important to clarify the nature of degrees of freedom associated with the\nphase and absolute value of the induced hybridisation, and correctly account\nfor the corresponding phase-space volume. We show that the OSDM-based treatment\nof the local fluctuations indeed provides an intuitive and concise description\n(including the phase-space integration measure). This allows to describe both\nthe lower-temperature regime where phase fluctuations destroy the long-range\norder, and the higher temperature crossover corresponding to a decrease of the\nabsolute value of hybridisation.

The analysis\nin CA is conducted based on the output from State Estimation (SE), another core\nEMS module.

The other is the model's inability to learn\ndeeper representations with more than one hidden layer for each network. Our\ngoal is to incorporate appropriate techniques to mitigate the aforementioned\nproblems of variational autoencoder CF and further improve the recommendation\nperformance. Our work is the first to apply flexible priors to collaborative\nfiltering and show that simple priors (in original VAEs) may be too restrictive\nto fully model user preferences and setting a more flexible prior gives\nsignificant gains. We experiment with the VampPrior, originally proposed for\nimage generation, to examine the effect of flexible priors in CF. We also show\nthat VampPriors coupled with gating mechanisms outperform SOTA results\nincluding the Variational Autoencoder for Collaborative Filtering by meaningful\nmargins on 2 popular benchmark datasets (MovieLens & Netflix).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Nov 2019 17:42:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

Particularly, we are interested\nin the case where the control precision is not very high, so the input factor\nvalues vary significantly even under the same setting of the corresponding\nmanipulating factors. The case is observed in our main application to carbon\nnanotube growth experiments, where one experimental input among many is\nmanipulated by another manipulating factors, and the relation between the input\nand the manipulating factors significantly varies in the dates and times of\noperations. Due to this variation, the standard GP surrogate that directly\nrelates the manipulating factors to the experimental outcome does not provide a\ngreat predictive power on the outcome. At the same time, the GP model relating\nthe main factors to the outcome directly is not appropriate for the prediction\npurpose because the main factors cannot be accurately set as planned for a\nfuture experiment. Motivated by the carbon nanotube example, we propose a\ntwo-tiered GP model, where the bottom tier relates the manipulating factors to\nthe corresponding main factors with potential biases and variation independent\nof the manipulating factors, and the top tier relates the main factors to the\nexperimental outcome. Our two-tier model explicitly models the propagation of\nthe control uncertainty to the experimental outcome through the two GP modeling\ntiers.

The pressure perturbation field needed to quantify\nthe injected energy is determined from the linear inviscid theory. The\ndissipation rate in the bulk of the domain is directly computed from the\nmeasurements, while the energy sink occurring in the boundary layers are\nestimated using the theoretical expression of the velocity field in the\nboundary layers, derived recently by Beckebanze et al.

The dependence of the different sources on the\nthickness of the experimental set-up is also discussed. In the nonlinear\nregime, the analysis is extended by estimating the dissipation due to the\nsecondary waves generated by triadic resonant instabilities showing the\nimportance of the energy transfer from large scales to small scales.

The\nproposed MRNN model is capable of deriving a representation that integrates\nrepresentations of different levels of abstraction from all the layers of the\nlearned hierarchical representation.Moreover, a duplex attention component is\ndesigned to refinethe multi-resolution representation so that an optimal\ncontextfor matching the query and document can be determined.

The latter\nattention mechanism aims to fine-tune the representation so that the query and\nthe relevant document are closer in proximity.

Using these\nderived privacy guarantees, we propose a novel sketch-based framework\n(DiffSketch) for distributed learning, where we compress the transmitted\nmessages via sketches to simultaneously achieve communication efficiency and\nprovable privacy benefits. Our evaluation demonstrates that DiffSketch can\nprovide strong differential privacy guarantees (e.g., $\\varepsilon$= 1) and\nreduce communication by 20-50x with only marginal decreases in accuracy.\nCompared to baselines that treat privacy and communication separately,\nDiffSketch improves absolute test accuracy by 5%-50% while offering the same\nprivacy guarantees and communication compression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Nov 2019 21:19:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 18:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-09"}

Dust\nbecomes charged to varying degrees in the radiative plasma environment of the\nsolar nebula (SN), and the resulting electrostatic force alters the\ntrajectories of colliding dust grains, influencing the structure of the dust\nrim as well as the time scale of rim formation. We compare the growth of FGRs\nin protoplanetary disks (PPD) with different turbulence strengths and plasma\nconditions to previous models which assumed neutral dust grains. We use a\ncombination of a Monte Carlo method and an N-body code to simulate the\ncollision of dust monomers with chondrules: a Monte Carlo algorithm is used to\nrandomly select dust particles that will collide with the chondrule as well as\ndetermine the elapsed time interval between collisions; at close approach, the\ndetailed collision process is modeled using an N-body algorithm, Aggregate\nBuilder (AB), to determine the collision outcome, as well as any restructuring\nof the chondrule rim.

The charge distribution of\nthe dust rim is modeled, used to calculate the trajectories of dust grains, and\nthen analyze the resulting morphology of the dust rim. In a weakly turbulent\nregion, the decreased relative velocity between charged particles causes small\ngrains to be repelled from the chondrule, causing dust rims to grow more slowly\nand be composed of larger monomers, which results in a more porous structure.\nIn a highly turbulent region, the presence of charge mainly affects the\nporosity of the rim by causing dust particles to deviate from the extremities\nof the rim and reducing the amount of restructuring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Nov 2019 21:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

Here we use\nthe recently developed method of hybrid quantum-classical simulations to\ncompute nuclear FIDs for $^{29}$Si-enriched silicon and fluorapatite.

We find a very\ngood overall agreement between the hybrid simulation results and the\nexperiments.

The space\ndiscretization is based on the ghost-point method, which falls under the\ncategory of unfitted boundary methods, since the mesh does not adapt to the\nmoving boundary. The equations are advanced in time by using Crank-Nicholson.\nThe momentum and continuity equations are solved simultaneously for the\nvelocity and the pressure by adopting a proper multigrid approach. To avoid the\ncheckerboard instability for the pressure, a staggered grid is adopted, where\nvelocities are defined at the sides of the cell and the pressure is defined at\nthe centre. The lack of uniqueness for the pressure is circumvented by the\ninclusion of an additional scalar unknown, representing the average divergence\nof the velocity, and an additional equation to set the average pressure to\nzero.

Methods: The recently proposed Echo Planar\nTime-resolved Imaging (EPTI) technique can achieve fast distortion- and\nblurring-free multi-contrast quantitative imaging. In this work, a subspace\nreconstruction framework is developed to improve the reconstruction accuracy of\nEPTI at high encoding accelerations. The number of unknowns in the\nreconstruction is significantly reduced by modeling the temporal signal\nevolutions using low-rank subspace. As part of the proposed reconstruction\napproach, a B0-update algorithm and a shot-to-shot B0 variation correction\nmethod are developed to enable the reconstruction of high-resolution tissue\nphase images and to mitigate artifacts from shot-to-shot phase variations.\nMoreover, the EPTI concept is extended to 3D k-space for 3D GE-EPTI, where a\nnew temporal-variant of CAIPI encoding is proposed to further improve\nperformance. Results: The effectiveness of the proposed subspace reconstruction\nwas demonstrated first in 2D GESE EPTI, where the reconstruction achieved\nhigher accuracy when compared to conventional B0-informed GRAPPA. For 3D\nGE-EPTI, a retrospective undersampling experiment demonstrates that the new\ntemporal-variant CAIPI encoding can achieve up to 72x acceleration with close\nto 2x reduction in reconstruction error when compared to conventional\nspatiotemporal-CAIPI encoding. In a prospective undersampling experiment,\nhigh-quality whole-brain T2* and QSM maps at 1 mm isotropic resolution was\nacquired in 52 seconds at 3T using 3D GE-EPTI with temporal-variant CAIPI\nencoding.

In order\nto optimize the hardware performance, a new class of stream cipher has been\nproposed. The basic idea is to employ a single Galois NLFSR with maximum period\nto construct the cipher. As a representative design of this kind of stream\nciphers, Espresso is based on a 256-bit Galois NLFSR initialized by a 128-bit\nkey. The $2^{256}-1$ maximum period is assured because the Galois NLFSR is\ntransformed from a maximum length LFSR. However, we propose a\nGalois-to-Fibonacci transformation algorithm and successfully transform the\nGalois NLFSR into a Fibonacci LFSR with a nonlinear output function.

Such picture is also a natural\n\"leading-order\" approximation to the holographic entanglement properties. Then,\nwe argue that the rank-2 U(1) theory with linearized diffeomorphism as its\ngauge symmetry, also known as a case of Lifshitz gravity, is the bulk field\ntheory behind such picture. The Gauss' laws and spatial curvature require the\nelectric field lines along the geodesics to be the fundamental dynamical\nvariables, which lead to geodesic string condensation.

The proposed scheme leverages\nnotions from single-user coding, random spreading, minimum-mean squared error\n(MMSE) estimation, and successive interference cancellation. Specifically,\nevery message is split into two parts: the first fragment serves as the\nargument to an injective function that determines which spreading sequence\nshould be employed, whereas the second component of the message is encoded\nusing a polar code. The latter coded bits are then spread using the sequence\ndetermined during the first step. The ensuing signal is transmitted through a\nGaussian multiple-access channel (GMAC). On the receiver side, active sequences\nare detected using a correlation-based energy detector, thereby simultaneously\nrecovering individual signature sequences and their generating information bits\nin the form of preimages of the sequence selection function. Using the set of\ndetected active spreading sequences, an MMSE estimator is employed to produce\nlog-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for the second part of the messages corresponding\nto these detected users. The LLRs associated with each detected user are then\npassed to a list decoder of the polar code, which performs single-user decoding\nto decode the second portion of the message. This decoding operation proceeds\niteratively by subtracting the interference due to the successfully decoded\nmessages from the received signal, and repeating the above steps on the\nresidual signal. At this stage, the proposed algorithm outperforms alternate\nexisting low-complexity schemes when the number of active uses is below 225.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 02:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

New applications with stringent real-time requirements on highly\nconstrained devices require further compression of MobileNets-like already\ncompute-efficient networks. Model quantization is a widely used technique to\ncompress and accelerate neural network inference and prior works have quantized\nMobileNets to 4-6 bits albeit with a modest to significant drop in accuracy.\nWhile quantization to sub-byte values (i.e. precision less than or equal to 8\nbits) has been valuable, even further quantization of MobileNets to binary or\nternary values is necessary to realize significant energy savings and possibly\nruntime speedups on specialized hardware, such as ASICs and FPGAs. Under the\nkey observation that convolutional filters at each layer of a deep neural\nnetwork may respond differently to ternary quantization, we propose a novel\nquantization method that generates per-layer hybrid filter banks consisting of\nfull-precision and ternary weight filters for MobileNets. The layer-wise hybrid\nfilter banks essentially combine the strengths of full-precision and ternary\nweight filters to derive a compact, energy-efficient architecture for\nMobileNets. Using this proposed quantization method, we quantized a substantial\nportion of weight filters of MobileNets to ternary values resulting in 27.98%\nsavings in energy, and a 51.07% reduction in the model size, while achieving\ncomparable accuracy and no degradation in throughput on specialized hardware in\ncomparison to the baseline full-precision MobileNets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 04:32:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

Experimental results on the public-domain CelebA and Helen\ndatabases show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods in jointly performing face super-resolution (up to 8 $\\times$) and face\ncompletion, and shows good generalization ability in cross-database testing.\nOur FCSR-GAN is also useful for improving face identification performance when\nthere are low-resolution and occlusion in face images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 06:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

The waypoint\nnavigation algorithm handles the minimum turn radius constraint of the MAV. The\nalgorithm also evaluates the feasibility of reaching a waypoint.

The MIL criterion\namounts to minimizing the (weighted) sum of Kullback-Leibler divergences (KLDs)\nwith the fused density appearing as righthand argument of the KLDs. In order to\nensure the fused density to be consistent with the local ones when LRFS\ndensities are marginal $\\delta$-generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli\n(M$\\delta$-GLMB) or labeled multi-Bernoulli (LMB) densities, the MIL rule is\nfurther elaborated by imposing the constraint that the fused density be in the\nsame family of local ones. In order to deal with different fields-of-view\n(FoVs) of the local densities, the global label space is divided into disjoint\nsubspaces which represent the exclusive FoVs and the common FoV of the agents,\nand each local density is decomposed into the sub-densities defined in the\ncorresponding subspaces. Then fusion is performed subspace-by-subspace to\ncombine local subdensities into global ones, and the global density is obtained\nby multiplying the global sub-densities. Further, in order to tackle the label\nmismatching issue arising in practical applications, a rank assignment\noptimization (RAO) of a suitably defined cost is carried out so as to match\nlabels from different agents. Moreover, issues concerning implementation of the\nMIL rule and its application to distributed multitarget tracking (DMT) are\ndiscussed. Finally, the performance of the proposed fusion approach is assessed\nvia simulation experiments considering DMT with either the same or different\nFoVs of the agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 09:30:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

Because stellar metallicity in unbarred galaxies depends on\nage as well as radial and vertical positions, the initial actions are\nparticularly well suited for assigning metallicities. We argue that assigning\nmetallicities based on single actions, or on positions, results in metallicity\ndistributions inconsistent with those observed in real galaxies. We therefore\nuse all three actions to assign metallicity to an N-body model by comparing\nwith the actions of a star-forming, unbarred simulation.

A framework is presented to define an effective b-value in DW-SSFP.\nTheory: The DW-SSFP signal is a summation of coherence pathways with different\nb-values. The relative contribution of each pathway is dictated by the flip\nangle. This leads to an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) estimate that\ndepends on the flip angle in non-Gaussian diffusion regimes. By acquiring\nDW-SSFP data at multiple flip angles and modelling the variation in ADC for a\ngiven form of non-Gaussianity, the ADC can be estimated at a well-defined\neffective b-value. Methods: A gamma distribution is used to model non-Gaussian\ndiffusion, embedded in the Buxton signal model for DW-SSFP. Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of non-Gaussian diffusion in DW-SSFP and diffusion-weighted\nspin-echo (DW-SE) sequences are used to verify the proposed framework.\nDependence of ADC on flip angle in DW-SSFP is verified with experimental\nmeasurements in a whole, human post-mortem brain.

The network has been trained with pairs of helioseismic phase\nshift maps and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager magnetograms acquired half a\nsolar rotation later, which were used as a proxy for the presence of active\nregions in the farside. The method has been validated using a set of artificial\ndata, and it has also been applied to actual solar observations during the\nperiod of minimum activity of the solar cycle 24. Our approach shows a higher\nsensitivity to the presence of farside active regions than standard methods\napplied up to date. The neural network can significantly increase the number of\ndetected farside active regions, and will potentially improve the application\nof farside seismology to space weather forecasting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 10:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

We propose\nan alternative approach based on UV colours of quasars as observed from GALEX\nsurveys. We built a NUV-selected sample of 9033 quasars with (FUV-NUV) colours.\nThe imprint of HI absorption in the observed colours is suggested qualitatively\nby their distribution as a function of quasar redshift. Because broad band\nfluxes lack spectral resolution and are sensitive to a large range of N_HI a\nMonte Carlo simulation of IGM opacity is required for quantitative analysis. It\nwas performed with absorbers randomly distributed along redshift and column\ndensity distributions, assumed to be a broken power law with index beta1 (10^15\n< N_HI <10^17.2 cm^-2) and beta2 (10^17.2 < N_HI <10^19 cm^-2). The redshift\ndistribution is proportional to the redshift evolution law of the number\ndensity of Lyman limit systems (LLS) per unit redshift as determined by\nspectroscopic surveys.The simulation is run with different assumptions on the\nspectral index alpha_nu of the quasar ionising flux. The fits between the\nsimulated and observed distribution of colours require an LLS redshift density\nlarger than that derived from spectroscopic counting. This result is robust in\nspite of difficulties in determining the colour dispersion other than that due\nto HI absorption. We provide arguments to retain alpha_nu = - 2, a value\nalready extreme with respect to those measured with HST/COS. Further fitting of\npower law index beta1 and beta2 leads to a higher density by a factor of 1.7\n(beta1 = -1.7, beta2 = -1.5), possibly 1.5 (beta1 = -1.7, beta2 = -1.7). Beyond\nthe result in terms of density the analysis of UV colours of quasars reveals a\ntension between the current description of IGM opacity at low z and the\npublished average ionising spectrum of quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 10:09:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

For a single straight line\nseparating two domains with the same substrate surface tension, the ridge\nprofile is shown to be be very close to that of Shanahan and de Gennes, but\nshift from the contact line of a distance equal to the elastocapillary length\nbuilt upon substrate surface tension and shear modulus. As a result, the\ndivergence near contact line disappears and is replaced by a balance of surface\ntensions at the contact line (Neumann equilibrium), though the profile remains\nnearly logarithmic. In the rivulet case, using the previous solution as a Green\nfunction allows one to calculate analytically the geometry of the distorted\nsubstrate, and in particular its slope on each side (wet and dry) of the\ncontact lines. These two slopes are shown to be nearly proportional to the\ninverse of substrate surface tensions, though the respective weight of each\nside (wet and dry) in the final expressions is difficult to establish because\nof the linear nature of standard elasticity.

In the last decade, deep\nlearning, and in particular Convolutional neural networks (CNN), have become\nessential for applications in signal processing and image recognition.

In this paper we propose a\nquantum algorithm for applying and training deep convolutional neural networks\nwith a potential speedup. The quantum CNN (QCNN) is a shallow circuit,\nreproducing completely the classical CNN, by allowing non linearities and\npooling operations. The QCNN is particularly interesting for deep networks and\ncould allow new frontiers in image recognition, by using more or larger\nconvolution kernels, larger or deeper inputs. We introduce a new quantum\ntomography algorithm with $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm guarantees, and new applications\nof probabilistic sampling in the context of information processing.

In this context, the use of an external magnetic field has emerged as a\nvery attractive possibility and a plethora of physical phenomena have been put\nforward in the last few years. Here, we predict some additional\nmagnetic-field-induced phenomena that can take place in the context of NFRHT\nbetween planar layered structures containing magneto-optical (MO) materials\n(mainly doped semiconductors like InSb). In particular, we predict the\npossibility of increasing the NFRHT upon applying an external magnetic field in\nan asymmetric structure consisting of two infinite plates made of InSb and Au.\nWe also study the impact of a magnetic field in the NFRHT between structures\ncontaining MO thin films and show that the effect is more drastic than in their\nbulk counterparts. Finally, we systematically investigate the anisotropic\nthermal magnetoresistance, i.e., the dependence of the radiative heat\nconductance on the orientation of an external magnetic field, in the case of\ntwo infinite plates made of InSb and show that one can strongly modulate the\nNFRHT by simply changing the orientation of the magnetic field. All the\nphenomena predicted in this work can be experimentally tested with existent\ntechnology and provide a new insight into the topic of active control of NFRHT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 10:36:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

A compact\nsensor, in which the cathode element is substituted with a dense array of\nparallel carbon nanotubes, could serve as the basic detection unit which - if\nadequately replicated - would allow to explore a significant region of light DM\nmass and cross-section. A similar detection scheme could be used to detect DM\nparticles with mass in the GeV range scattering off the surface of a CNT and\nejecting a carbon ion. We report about the Monte Carlo simulations of such a\nsystem and the R&D towards a detector prototype.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 10:47:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

Among\nthe major challenges in solving this task is the scarcity of annotated\negocentric video datasets with dense annotations for pose, depth, or egomotion.\nTo surmount this difficulty, we use state-of-the-art models to generate (noisy)\nannotations and propose robust forecasting models that can learn from this\nnoisy supervision.

A recent study proposed that the acquisition of rotationally\ninvariant DDE metrics, typically obtained using a spherical \"5-design\", could\nbe greatly simplified by assuming Gaussian diffusion, facilitating reduced\nacquisition times that are more compatible with clinical settings. Here, we aim\nto validate the new minimal acquisition scheme against the standard DDE\n5-design, and to quantify the proposed method's noise robustness to facilitate\nfuture clinical use. Methods: DDE MRI experiments were performed on both ex\nvivo and in vivo rat brains at 9.4 T using the 5-design and the proposed\nminimal design and taking into account the difference in the number of\nacquisitions. The ensuing microscopic fractional anisotropy ({\\mu}FA) maps were\ncompared over a range of b-values up to 5000 s/mm2.

Our\napproach aims to overcome two important problems encountered in training an\nanchor based detector: (1) ambiguity in the assignment of anchor to ground\ntruth and (2) class and object size imbalance. To address the first limitation,\nwe propose a soft positive/negative anchor assignment procedure based on a new\noverlapping function called \"Per-Object Normalized Overlap\" (PONO).

More\nconcretely, given a specific target speaker, how likely is it to find another\nperson who gets falsely accepted as that target? This question may be addressed\nempirically by studying naturally confusable pairs of speakers within a large\nenough corpus. To this end, one might expect to find at least some speaker\npairs that are indistinguishable from each other in terms of ASV. To a certain\nextent, such aim is mirrored in the standardized ASV evaluation benchmarks.\nHowever, the number of speakers in such evaluation benchmarks represents only a\nsmall fraction of all possible human voices, making it challenging to\nextrapolate performance beyond a given corpus. Furthermore, the impostors used\nin performance evaluation are usually selected randomly. A potentially more\nmeaningful definition of an impostor - at least in the context of\nsecurity-driven ASV applications - would be closest (most confusable) other\nspeaker to a given target.\n  We put forward a novel performance assessment framework to address both the\ninadequacy of the random-impostor evaluation model and the size limitation of\nevaluation corpora by addressing ASV security against closest impostors on\narbitrarily large datasets. The framework allows one to make a prediction of\nthe safety of given ASV technology, in its current state, for arbitrarily large\nspeaker database size consisting of virtual (sampled) speakers. As a\nproof-of-concept, we analyze the performance of two state-of-the-art ASV\nsystems, based on i-vector and x-vector speaker embeddings (as implemented in\nthe popular Kaldi toolkit), on the recent VoxCeleb 1 & 2 corpora.

By contrast, apart from\nbranch cantilevering, burrowing, swimming, and gliding, laboratory studies of\nsnake locomotion focused on that on simple flat surfaces. Here, to begin to\nunderstand snake locomotion in complex 3-D terrain, we study how the variable\nkingsnake, a terrestrial generalist, traversed a large step of variable surface\nfriction and step height (up to 30% snout-vent length). The snake traversed by\npartitioning its body into three sections with distinct functions. Body\nsections below and above the step oscillated laterally on horizontal surfaces\nfor propulsion, while the body section in between cantilevered in a vertical\nplane to bridge the large height increase. As the animal progressed, these\nthree sections traveled down its body, conforming overall body shape to the\nstep. In addition, the snake adjusted the partitioned gait in response to\nincrease in step height and decrease in surface friction, at the cost of\nreduced speed. As surface friction decreased, body movement below and above the\nstep changed from a continuous lateral undulation with little slip to an\nintermittent oscillatory movement with much slip, and initial head lift-off\nbecame closer to the step. Given these adjustments, body partitioning allowed\nthe snake to be always stable, even when initially cantilevering but before\nreaching the surface above. Such a partitioned gait may be generally useful for\ndiverse, complex 3-D terrain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 14:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

For a given current, there exists a critical disorder\nstrength below which its transverse motion could either be boosted below a\ncritical damping or be hindered above the critical damping, resulting in\ncurrent and disorder dependences of skyrmion Hall angle. The boosting comes\nmainly from the random force that is opposite to the driving force (current).\nThe critical damping depends on the current density and disorder strength.\nHowever, the longitudinal motion of a skyrmion is always hindered by the\ndisorder. Above the critical disorder strength, skyrmions are pinned. The\ndisorder-induced random force on a skyrmion can be classified as static and\nkinetic ones, similar to the friction force in the Newtonian mechanics. In the\npinning phase, the static (pinning) random force is transverse to the current\ndensity. The kinetic random force is opposite to the skyrmion velocity when\nskyrmions are in motion.

In this work, we have demonstrated an end to end\nprocedure to improve the performance of semantic search using semi-supervised\nand unsupervised learning algorithms. An available Bengali repository was\nchosen to have seven types of semantic properties primarily to develop the\nsystem. Performance has been tested using Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes,\nDecision Tree and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

In our model and within the mitigation process, first, the backup host\nto migrate the failed function is selected. Then, the state of the function is\nmigrated. The process should be carried out in less than TAT. An optimization\nproblem is formulated investigating cost-effective failure mitigation of\nadditive functions. The problem is of mixed integer non convex form. To tackle\nthe computational complexity, it is bisected into two back-to-back\nleader-follower parts. The leader selects the migration destinations and the\nfollower divides network resources among functions for migration. These\nproblems are both NP-hard. For the leader problem, a central heuristic based on\nthe Viterbi algorithm suggested. The follower problem is converted into two\nconvex sub-problems. The validity of the proposed algorithms is proved via\nextensive numerical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 15:21:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

Strong\ntheoretical guarantees require taking into account the importance of each\npoint, measured by how much its individual loss contributes to $F(x)$.\nMaximizing this importance over all $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$ yields the\n\\emph{sensitivity score} of $a_i$. Sampling with probabilities proportional to\nthese scores gives strong guarantees, allowing one to approximately minimize of\n$F$ using just the subsampled points.\n  Unfortunately, sensitivity sampling is difficult to apply since (1) it is\nunclear how to efficiently compute the sensitivity scores and (2) the sample\nsize required is often impractically large.

In this\npaper, we conduct the first comprehensive and systematic study of the\nadversarial attacks on SR systems (SRSs) to understand their security weakness\nin the practical blackbox setting. For this purpose, we propose an adversarial\nattack, named FAKEBOB, to craft adversarial samples.

Then we model (joint)\ndensities as linear combinations of orthonormal polynomials, getting its\ndecomposition into (mixed) moments. Then here we model each moment (separately)\nof predicted variable as a linear combination of mixed moments of known\nvariables using least squares linear regression - getting accurate description\nwith interpretable coefficients describing linear relations between moments.\nCombining such predicted moments we get predicted density as a polynomial, for\nwhich we can e.g. calculate expected value, but also variance to evaluate\nuncertainty of such prediction, or we can use the entire distribution e.g. for\nmore accurate further calculations or generating random values. There were\nperformed 10-fold cross-validation log-likelihood tests for 22 DAX companies,\nleading to very accurate predictions, especially when using individual models\nfor each company as there were found large differences between their behaviors.\nAdditional advantage of the discussed methodology is being computationally\ninexpensive, finding and evaluation a model with hundreds of parameters and\nthousands of data points takes a second on a laptop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 09:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-07"}

To ensure the continuation of the grid's operational flow when those\nphenomena happen, the grid operator must immediately take steps to nullify the\nimpacts and repair the problems, even if those occur in hardly-reachable remote\nareas. Emerging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) show great potential to replace\ntraditional human patrols for regularly monitoring critical situations\ninvolving the safety of the grid. The critical lines can be monitored by a\nfleet of UAVs to ensure a resilient surveillance system.

The verification process ultimately provides a trajectory plan\nfor the UAVs, including the refueling schedules. The resiliency requirement of\ninspecting a point on a line is expressed in terms of a $k-$property specifying\nthat if $k$ UAVs fail or compromised still there is a UAV to collect the data\nat the point within on time.

Standard machine learning approaches are promising, but lack\ninterpretability, are generally interpolative, and ineffective for precise\nfuture interventions with costly and wasteful false positives. Here, we are\nintroducing Granger Network inference as a new forecasting approach for\nindividual infractions with demonstrated performance far surpassing past\nresults, yet transparent enough to validate and extend social theory.\nConsidering the problem of predicting crime in the City of Chicago, we achieve\nan average AUC of ~90\\% for events predicted a week in advance within spatial\ntiles approximately $1000$ ft across. Instead of pre-supposing that crimes\nunfold across contiguous spaces akin to diffusive systems, we learn the local\ntransport rules from data. As our key insights, we uncover indications of\nsuburban bias -- how law-enforcement response is modulated by socio-economic\ncontexts with disproportionately negative impacts in the inner city -- and how\nthe dynamics of violent and property crimes co-evolve and constrain each other\n-- lending quantitative support to controversial pro-active policing policies.\nTo demonstrate broad applicability to spatio-temporal phenomena, we analyze\nterror attacks in the middle-east in the recent past, and achieve an AUC of\n~80% for predictions made a week in advance, and within spatial tiles measuring\napproximately 120 miles across. We conclude that while crime operates near an\nequilibrium quickly dissipating perturbations, terrorism does not. Indeed\nterrorism aims to destabilize social order, as shown by its dynamics being\nsusceptible to run-away increases in event rates under small perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 15:41:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-14"}

The dynamic range of an excitable network quantifies the\nrange of stimulus intensities that can be robustly distinguished by the network\nresponse, and is maximized at the critical state. In this study, we examine the\nimpacts of backtracking activation on system criticality in excitable networks\nconsisting of both excitatory and inhibitory units. We find that, for dynamics\nwith refractory states that prohibit backtracking activation, the critical\nstate occurs when the largest eigenvalue of the weighted non-backtracking (WNB)\nmatrix for excitatory units, $\\lambda^E_{NB}$, is close to one, regardless of\nthe strength of inhibition. In contrast, for dynamics without refractory state\nin which backtracking activation is allowed, the strength of inhibition affects\nthe critical condition through suppression of backtracking activation. As\ninhibitory strength increases, backtracking activation is gradually suppressed.\nAccordingly, the system shifts continuously along a continuum between two\nextreme regimes -- from one where the criticality is determined by the largest\neigenvalue of the weighted adjacency matrix for excitatory units,\n$\\lambda^E_W$, to the other where the critical state is reached when\n$\\lambda_{NB}^E$ is close to one. For systems in between, we find that\n$\\lambda^E_{NB}<1$ and $\\lambda^E_W>1$ at the critical state. These findings,\nconfirmed by numerical simulations using both random and synthetic neural\nnetworks, indicate that backtracking activation impacts the criticality of\nexcitable networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 14:07:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 02:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-20"}
