Spin-flop transitions occur with magnetic\nfields applied within the $ab$-plane while are absent for fields parallel to\nthe $c$-axis. Anisotropic magnetic phase diagrams are observed and the\norientation of the ground magnetic moment is found to be within the $ab$-plane.\nThe magnetoresistivity for EuIn$_2$As$_2$ behaves non-monotonic as a function\nof field strength.

Instead of relying on a single expert annotator,\ncrowdsourcing shares the labelling effort among a large number of\ncollaborators. For instance, this is being applied to the data acquired by the\nlaureate Laser Interferometer Gravitational Waves Observatory (LIGO), in order\nto detect glitches which might hinder the identification of true\ngravitational-waves. The crowdsourcing scenario poses new challenging\ndifficulties, as it deals with different opinions from a heterogeneous group of\nannotators with unknown degrees of expertise. Probabilistic methods, such as\nGaussian Processes (GP), have proven successful in modeling this setting.\nHowever, GPs do not scale well to large data sets, which hampers their broad\nadoption in real practice (in particular at LIGO). This has led to the recent\nintroduction of deep learning based crowdsourcing methods, which have become\nthe state-of-the-art. However, the accurate uncertainty quantification of GPs\nhas been partially sacrificed.

As NVM-based memories are\nexpected to restore their data after recovery, the security metadata must be\nrecovered as well. However, persisting all affected security metadata on each\nmemory write would significantly degrade performance and exacerbate the write\nendurance problem. Moreover, recovery time can increase significantly (up to\nhours for practical memory sizes) when security metadata are not updated\nstrictly. Counter trees are used in state-of-the-art commercial secure\nprocessors, e.g., Intel's Safe Guard Extension (SGX). Counter trees have a\nunique challenge due to the inability to recover the whole tree from leaves.\nThus, to ensure recoverability, all updates to the tree must be persisted,\nwhich can be tens of additional writes on each write. The state-of-art scheme,\nAnubis, enables recoverability but incurs an additional write per cache\neviction, i.e., reduces lifetime to approximately half. Additionally, Anubis\ndegrades performance significantly in many cases. In this paper, we propose\nPhoenix, a practical novel scheme which relies on elegantly reproducing the\ncache content before a crash, however with minimal overheads. Our evaluation\nresults show that Phoenix reduces persisting security metadata overhead writes\nfrom 87\\% extra writes (for Anubis) to less than write-back compared to an\nencrypted system without recovery, thus improving the NVM lifetime by 2x.\nOverall Phoenix performance is better than the baseline, unlike Anubis which\nadds 7.9\\% (max of 35\\%) performance overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 16:32:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

This tendency remains strong even as the frequency width is reduced.\n  2. Narrow bandwidth wavetrains exhibit predominantly K-type transition.

Specifically, we train two\nnetworks in two phases: first, we only use whole tumor scribbles to train a\nwhole tumor (WT) segmentation network, which roughly recovers the WT mask of\ntraining data; then we cluster the WT region with the guide of global labels.\nThe rough substructure segmentation from clustering is used as weak labels to\ntrain the second network. The dense CRF loss is used to refine the weakly\nsupervised segmentation. We evaluate our approach on the BraTS2017 dataset and\nachieve competitive WT dice score as well as comparable scores on substructure\nsegmentation compared to an upper bound when trained with fully annotated\nmasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 16:56:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-07"}

The S-matrix of the deformed QFT\ndiffers from the original S-matrix only by an overall phase factor that depends\non the charges and momenta of the external particles, thus supporting the\nconjecture that such QFTs are UV complete, although intrinsically non-local.\nFor the special case of an integrable QFT, we check that this phase factor\nprecisely reproduces the change in the finite-size spectrum via the\nThermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 19:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 11:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

However, the detailed physics of these particle acceleration processes\nis still not well understood. One of the main open questions is the role of\nfossil relativistic electrons that have been deposited in the intra-cluster\nmedium by radio galaxies. These synchrotron-emitting electrons are very\ndifficult to study, as their radiative life time is only tens of Myrs at GHz\nfrequencies, and are therefore a relatively unexplored population. Despite the\ntypical steep radio spectrum due to synchrotron losses, these fossil electrons\nare barely visible even at radio frequencies well below a GHz. However, when a\npocket of fossil radio plasma is compressed, it boosts the visibility at\nsub-GHz frequencies, creating so-called radio phoenices. This compression can\nbe the result of bulk motion and shocks in the ICM due to merger activity. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate the discovery potential of low frequency radio sky\nsurveys to find and study revived fossil plasma sources in galaxy clusters. We\nused the 150~MHz TGSS and 1.4 GHz NVSS sky surveys to identify candidate radio\nphoenices.

Using these observations, we identified common\nobservational properties (radio morphology, ultra-steep spectrum, X-ray\nluminosity, dynamical state) that will enable us to identify this class of\nsources more easily, and help to understand the physical origin of these\nsources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 19:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

Each user sends a batch\nof $k$ i.i.d. samples from this distribution; however an $\\epsilon$-fraction of\nusers are untrustworthy and can send adversarially chosen responses. The goal\nis then to learn $p$ in total variation distance. When $k = 1$ this is the\nstandard robust univariate density estimation setting and it is well-understood\nthat $\\Omega (\\epsilon)$ error is unavoidable. Suprisingly, Qiao and Valiant\ngave an estimator which improves upon this rate when $k$ is large.\nUnfortunately, their algorithms run in time exponential in either $n$ or $k$.\n  We first give a sequence of polynomial time algorithms whose estimation error\napproaches the information-theoretically optimal bound for this problem. Our\napproach is based on recent algorithms derived from the sum-of-squares\nhierarchy, in the context of high-dimensional robust estimation.

To do so, we demonstrate that these sum-of-squares algorithms for\nrobust mean estimation can be made to handle complex combinatorial constraints\n(e.g. those arising from VC theory), which may be of independent technical\ninterest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 19:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-07"}

Finally, the\nprospect of studying massive stars in metal poor galaxies is evaluated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 19:26:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 08:46:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

As the vehicle drives past the beacon, the\nreceiver and beacon are momentarily in range, the receiver then stores a unique\nID from the beacon and when the vehicle is then in an area with GSM signal, an\nSMS is sent containing the unique IDs of the beacons that have been detected.\nThis project is prototyped and tested in collaboration with the Danau Girang\nField Centre in Sabah, Malaysia.

The nanopore's wall carries a bipolar charge\npattern with a larger positive buffer region determining the anions as the main\ncharge carriers and the smaller negative binding region containing binding\nsites. This charge pattern proved to be an appropriate one as shown by a\nprevious comparative study of varying charge patterns (M\\'adai et al.\\\n\\textit{J. Mol. Liq.}, 2019, \\textbf{283}, 391--398.). Binding of the positive\nanalyte ions attracts more anions in the pore thus increasing the current. The\nasymmetric nature of the pore results in an additional device function,\nrectification. Our model, therefore, is a dual response device. Using a reduced\nmodel of the nanopore studied by a hybrid computer simulation method (Local\nEquilibrium Monte Carlo coupled to the Nernst-Planck equation) we show that we\ncan create a sensor whose underlying mechanisms are based on the changes of the\nlocal electric field as a response to changing thermodynamic conditions. The\nchange of the electric field results in changes in the local ionic\nconcentrations (depletion zones), and, thus, changes in ionic currents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 20:54:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-07"}

To utilize the Huber loss, a parameter that controls the transitions\nfrom a quadratic function to an absolute value function needs to be selected.\nWe believe the standard probabilistic interpretation that relates the Huber\nloss to the Huber density fails to provide adequate intuition for identifying\nthe transition point. As a result, a hyper-parameter search is often necessary\nto determine an appropriate value. In this work, we propose an alternative\nprobabilistic interpretation of the Huber loss, which relates minimizing the\nloss to minimizing an upper-bound on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between\nLaplace distributions, where one distribution represents the noise in the\nground-truth and the other represents the noise in the prediction. In addition,\nwe show that the parameters of the Laplace distributions are directly related\nto the transition point of the Huber loss. We demonstrate, through a toy\nproblem, that the optimal transition point of the Huber loss is closely related\nto the distribution of the noise in the ground-truth data. As a result, our\ninterpretation provides an intuitive way to identify well-suited\nhyper-parameters by approximating the amount of noise in the data, which we\ndemonstrate through a case study and experimentation on the Faster R-CNN and\nRetinaNet object detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 21:15:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 19:23:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 19:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

These models are traditionally\ntwo-dimensional, focusing on the mass within the cluster and either ignoring or\napproximating any contribution from line-of-sight galaxies. In this paper, we\npresent the first full set of three-dimensional mass models of the six Hubble\nFrontier Fields and use them to test for systematic biases in magnifications\ndue to using the traditional 2D approach. We find that omitting foreground or\nbackground galaxies causes image position offsets between 0.1-0.4\", a\nnon-negligible fraction of the typical 0.3-0.7\" residuals of current\nstate-of-the-art models. We also find that median image magnifications can\nshift by up to 6%, though it is dependent on the field.

Given that nowadays system-wise failure\nrate needs to be capped under a threshold value for reliability and\ncost-efficiency purposes, we quantitatively discuss different scenarios of\nsystem resilience, and analyze the impacts of resilience to different error\ntypes on the variation of system failure rates, and the correlation of\nhierarchical failure rates. Moreover, we formalize and showcase the resilience\nefficiency of failure-bounded supercomputers today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 22:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-07"}

First, we propose a novel formalization for adversarial ML\nevasion attacks in the problem-space, which includes the definition of a\ncomprehensive set of constraints on available transformations, preserved\nsemantics, robustness to preprocessing, and plausibility.

One of the difficulty is that after scaling, the\nsolutions are usually of large data since the perturbation of the hypersonic\nflow is usually not small related to the sonic speed. In order to make it, we\nfirst employ the modified Glimm scheme to construct the approximate solutions\nwith large data and find fine structure of the elementary wave curves to obtain\nthe global existence of entropy solutions with large data, for fixed $K$ and\nsufficiently large Mach number of the incoming flow $M_{\\infty}$.

A natural solution is to \"shrink\nthe shoulders\" of a shrinkage prior by lightening up its tails beyond a\nreasonable parameter range, yielding a regularized version of the prior.

Deviation from the SCT prediction is drastic for the critical\nperturbation strength of the transition: if $M$ is fixed the SCT presents\nplausible prediction for the parameter dependence of the critical value, but\nits value is $1/(M-1)$times smaller than the SCT prediction, which implies\nexistence of a strong cooperativity of the harmonic perturbations with the main\nmode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 03:49:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

We offer a statistical model within the context of rational finance\nwhich can be used without relying on behavioral finance assumptions to model\nthe predictability of stock returns. We incorporate the predictability of stock\nreturns into the well-known Black-Scholes option pricing formula. Empirically,\nwe analyze the option and spot trader's market predictability of stock prices\nby defining a forward-looking measure which we call \"implied excess\npredictability\". The empirical results indicate the effect of option trader's\npredictability of stock returns on the price of stock options is an increasing\nfunction of moneyness, while this effect is decreasing for spot traders. These\nempirical results indicate potential asymmetric predictability of stock prices\nby spot and option traders. We show in pricing options with the strike price\nsignificantly higher or lower than the stock price, the predictability of the\nunderlying stock's return should be incorporated into the option pricing\nformula. In pricing options that have moneyness close to one, stock return\npredictability is not incorporated into the option pricing model because stock\nreturn predictability is the same for both types of traders. In other words,\nspot traders and option traders are equally informed about the future value of\nthe stock market in this case. Comparing different volatility measures, we find\nthat the difference between implied and realized variances or variance risk\npremium can potentially be used as a stock return predictor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 04:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-07"}

Our system of polynomial equations may be viewed as a\nmatricial analog of polynomial reformulations of 0/1 combinatorial optimization\nproblems, for which semidefinite relaxations have been extensively\ninvestigated. We illustrate numerically the utility of our approach in stylized\nexamples that are drawn from various applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 06:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-07"}

The extracts from Centaurea damascena\npossessed antibacterial activity against several of the tested microorganisms.\nThe MIC of methanol extract of C. damascena ranged from 60 to 1100 microgram\nper mL. Free radical scavenging capacity of the C. damascena methanol extract\nwas calculated by DPPH and FRAP test. DPPH radicals were scavenged with an IC50\nvalue of 17.08 microgram per mL. Antioxidant capacities obtained by the FRAP\nwas 51.9 and expressed in mg Trolox per gram dry weight. The total phenolic\ncompounds of the methanol extracts of aerial parts, as estimated by\nFolin_Ciocalteu reagent method, was about 460 mg GAE per gram. The phenolic\ncontents in the extracts highly correlate with their antioxidant activity,\nconfirming that the antioxidant activity of this plant extracts is considerably\nphenolic contents-dependent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 08:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-07"}

The major cosmic ray\nelectron transport mechanisms within the plane of galactic disks are diffusion\nand streaming. A predicted radio continuum map can be obtained by convolving\nthe map of comic ray electron sources, represented by that of the star\nformation, with adaptive Gaussian and exponential kernels. The ratio between\nthe smoothing lengthscales at 6cm and 20cm can be used to distinguish between\ndiffusion and streaming as the dominant transport mechanism.

It is found that in asymmetric\nridges of polarized radio continuum emission the total power emission is\nenhanced with respect to the star formation rate.

We instead use a reduction to the Steiner tree problem\nwhich was previously used in parameterized algorithms [Basavaraju et al.'14].\nThis reduction is not approximation preserving, and using the current best\napproximation factor for Steiner tree [Byrka et al.'13] as a black-box would\nnot be good enough to improve on $2$. To achieve the latter goal, we ``open the\nbox'' and exploit the specific properties of the instances of Steiner tree\narising from CacAP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 08:55:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2019 14:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

This approach, known as reverse engineering,\nrequires the construction of models able to efficiently predict continuous\nstructure-property maps.

In total, this analysis shows that\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex phases appear in much wider contexts than the $120^\\circ$\nN\\'eel ordered systems previously studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 09:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

The role of\nelectrical and chemical synapse connection in diversity of neural activity\ngeneration has been investigated separately in networks of varying\ncomplexities. Nevertheless, theoretical understanding of hybrid synapses in\ndiverse dynamical states of neural networks for self-organization and\nrobustness still has not been fully studied. Here, we present a model of neural\nnetwork built with hybrid synapses to investigate the emergence of global and\ncollective dynamics states. This neural networks consists of excitatory and\ninhibitory population interacting together. The excitatory population is\nconnected by excitatory synapses in small world topology and its adjacent\nneurons are also connected by gap junctions. The inhibitory population is only\nconnected by chemical inhibitory synapses with all-to-all interaction. Our\nnumerical simulations show that in the balanced networks with absence of\nelectrical coupling, the synchrony states generated by this architecture are\nmainly controlled by heterogeneity among neurons and the balance of its\nexcitatory and inhibitory inputs. In balanced networks with strong electrical\ncoupling, several dynamical states arise from different combinations of\nexcitatory and inhibitory weights. More importantly, we find that these states,\nsuch as synchronous firing, cluster synchrony, and various ripples events,\nemerge by slight modification of chemical coupling weights. For large enough\nelectrical synapse coupling, the whole neural networks become synchronized. Our\nresults pave a way in the study of the dynamical mechanisms and computational\nsignificance of the contribution of mixed synapse in the neural functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 10:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Replacing independent lasers with\nan optical frequency comb can enable very dense packing by overcoming relative\ndrifts. However, to date, interference from non-ideal spectral shaping prevents\nexploiting the full potential of frequency combs. Here, we demonstrate\ncomb-enabled multi-channel digital signal processing, which overcomes these\nlimitations. Each channel is detected using an independent coherent receiver\nand processed at two samples-per-symbol. By accounting for the unique comb\nstability and exploiting aliasing in the design of the dynamic equalizer, we\nshow that the optimal spectral shape changes, resulting in a higher signal to\nnoise ratio that pushes the optimal symbol rate towards and even \\emph{above}\nthe channel spacing, resulting in the first example of frequency-domain\nsuper-Nyquist transmission with multi-channel detection for optical systems.\nThe scheme is verified both in back-to-back configuration and in single span\ntransmission of a 21 channel superchannel originating from a 25GHz-spaced\nfrequency comb. By jointly processing 3 wavelength channels at a time, we\nachieve spectral efficiency beyond what is possible with independent channels.\nAt the same time, one significantly relaxes the hardware requirements on\ndigital-to-analog resolution and bandwidth, and well as filter tap numbers. Our\nresults show that comb-enabled multi-channel processing can overcome the\nlimitations of classical dense wavelength division multiplexing systems by\nenabling tighter spacing to reach the ultimate spectral efficiency in optical\ncommunications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 11:52:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 08:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

This coordination is achieved through the function\nof the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular \"fuel gauge\" that is\nexpressed in essentially all eukaryotic cells as heterotrimeric complexes\ncontaining catalytic $\\alpha$ subunits and regulatory $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$\nsubunits. When cellular energy status has been compromised, AMPK is activated\nby increases in AMP:ATP or ADP:ATP ratios and acts to restore energy\nhomeostasis by stimulating energy production via catabolic pathways while\ndecreasing non-essential energy-consuming pathways. Although the primary\nfunction of AMPK is to regulate energy homeostasis at a cell-autonomous level,\nin multicellular organisms, the AMPK system has evolved to interact with\nhormones to regulate energy intake and expenditure at the whole body level.\nThus, AMPK functions as a signaling hub, coordinating anabolic and catabolic\npathways to balance nutrient supply with energy demand at both the cellular and\nwhole-body levels. AMPK is activated by various metabolic stresses such as\nischemia or hypoxia or glucose deprivation and has both acute and long-term\neffects on metabolic pathways and key cellular functions. In addition, AMPK\nappears to be a major sensor of energy demand in exercising muscle and acts\nboth as a multitask gatekeeper and an energy regulator in skeletal muscle.\nAcute activation of AMPK has been shown to promote glucose transport and fatty\nacid oxidation while suppressing glycogen synthase activity and protein\nsynthesis. Chronic activation of AMPK induces a shift in muscle fiber type\ncomposition, reduces markers of muscle degeneration and enhances muscle\noxidative capacity potentially by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis.\nFurthermore, recent evidence demonstrates that AMPK may not only regulate\nmetabolism during exercise but also in the recovery phase. AMPK acts as a\nmolecular transducer between exercise and insulin signaling and is necessary\nfor the ability of prior contraction/exercise to increase muscle insulin\nsensitivity. Based on these observations, drugs that activate AMPK might be\nexpected to be useful in the treatment of metabolic disorders and insulin\nresistance in various conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 12:44:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-07"}

The\natoms are confined within a standing-wave resonator and an atomic metastable\ndipolar transition couples to a cavity mode. The atomic dipole is incoherently\npumped in the parameter regime that would correspond to stationary\nsuperradiance in absence of inhomogeneous broadening. Starting from the master\nequation for cavity field and atomic degrees of freedom we derive a mean-field\nmodel that allows us to determine a threshold temperature, above which thermal\nfluctuations suppress superradiant emission. We then analyze the dynamics of\nsuperradiant emission when the motion is described by a mean-field model. In\nthe semiclassical regime and below the threshold temperature we observe that\nthe emitted light can be either coherent or chaotic, depending on the\nincoherent pump rate. We then analyze superradiant emission from an ideal Bose\ngas at zero temperature when the superradiant decay rate $\\Lambda$ is of the\norder of the recoil frequency $\\omega_R$. We show that the quantized exchange\nof mechanical energy between the atoms and the field gives rise to a threshold,\n$\\Lambda_c$, below which superradiant emission is damped down to zero.

For $w>w_c$ the gratings are stable and the system\nachieves stationary superradiance. Below this second threshold the coupled\ndynamics becomes chaotic.

By applying the Pontryagin's\nmaximum principle, we obtain a solution to the forward and backward stochastic\ndifference equations. Based on this solution, we derive the optimal controllers\nto minimize a quadratic cost function. Combining the optimal controllers with\nthe EEC, the controller C1 is decoupled from the ECC. It should be emphasized\nthat the control gain is dependent on the estimation gain. What's more, the\nestimation gain satisfies the forward Riccati equation and the control gain\nsatisfies the backward Riccati equation which makes the problem more\nchallenging. We propose iterative solutions to the Riccati equations and give a\nsuboptimal solution to the optimal decentralized control problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 14:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-07"}

However, it is difficult to find a universal expression\nto predict the elastic moduli according to the glass composition before\nsynthesis since the elastic moduli are a complex function of interatomic bonds\nand their ordering at different length scales. Here we show that the densities\nand elastic moduli of SiO2-based glasses can be efficiently predicted by\nmachine learning (ML) techniques across a complex compositional space with\nmultiple (>10) types of additive oxides besides SiO2. Our machine learning\napproach relies on a training set generated by high-throughput molecular\ndynamic (MD) simulations, a set of elaborately constructed descriptors that\nbridges the empirical statistical modeling with the fundamental physics of\ninteratomic bonding, and a statistical learning/predicting model developed by\nimplementing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with a gradient\nboost machine (GBM-LASSO).

In the considered model, each user exploits limited\nlocal computational resources to train a local FL model with its collected data\nand, then, sends the trained FL model to a base station (BS) which aggregates\nthe local FL model and broadcasts it back to all of the users. Since FL\ninvolves an exchange of a learning model between users and the BS, both\ncomputation and communication latencies are determined by the learning accuracy\nlevel. Meanwhile, due to the limited energy budget of the wireless users, both\nlocal computation energy and transmission energy must be considered during the\nFL process. This joint learning and communication problem is formulated as an\noptimization problem whose goal is to minimize the total energy consumption of\nthe system under a latency constraint. To solve this problem, an iterative\nalgorithm is proposed where, at every step, closed-form solutions for time\nallocation, bandwidth allocation, power control, computation frequency, and\nlearning accuracy are derived. Since the iterative algorithm requires an\ninitial feasible solution, we construct the completion time minimization\nproblem and a bisection-based algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal\nsolution, which is a feasible solution to the original energy minimization\nproblem.

The\nbright-edge of the colour-magnitude diagram evolves with little dependence on\ngalaxy colour, and therefore on the amount of star formation taking place in\nbright galaxies. We modelled this evolution with delayed exponential star\nformation histories (SFHs), to better understand the time-scale of the turn-off\nin star formation activity. We show that using SFHs without quenching, the\ntransition from the blue cloud to the red sequence is too slow. This indicates\nthat a scenario purely driven by the consumption of the gas inside each galaxy\ndoes not reproduce the observed evolution of the colour-magnitude bright edge.\nAmong the quenching scenarios explored, the one that best matches the\nobservations assumes that galaxies stop their star formation at a randomly\nselected time with a uniform distribution up to $2.5$ Gyr.

By varying the coupling strength of the\nfour-point interaction in relation to the kinetic term, one can analyze the\nphase structure of the model. This intriguing fact leads us to investigate\nwhether similar Hamiltonians with four-point interactions can also be studied\nas a function of their four-point coupling strength. In this paper, we\nreexamine the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, regarding it generally beyond the\ncontext of quantum chromodynamics. Essentially, it is a model in which\nparticle-antiparticle pairing leads to a BCS-like condensate, with the result\nthat chiral symmetry is broken dynamically in the strong-coupling regime. To\nstudy the behavior of the system, it is necessary to move from this regime to a\nhypothetical regime of weak coupling, altering the coupling strength of the\ninteraction arbitrarily. In order to do this, the gap equation must be regarded\nas complex and its Riemann surface structure must be known. We do this and\nobtain a continuous quantum phase transition characterized by the development\nof a complex order parameter (the dynamically generated mass) from the second\nsheet of the Riemann surface, as we move into the weak-coupling regime. The\npower-law behavior of the order parameter in the vicinity of the phase\ntransition point is demonstrated to be independent of the choice of the\nregularization scheme with the critical exponent as $\\beta \\approx 0.55$. At\nthe same time, the isovector pseudoscalar modes retain their feature as\nGoldstone modes and still have zero mass, while the isoscalar scalar meson\nfollows the behavior of the order parameter and gains a width. Energetically,\nthis mode is not favored over the normal, uncondensed mode but would have to be\naccessed through an excitation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 15:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

In such situations, it is often useful to rely on machine learning\nmethods to fill in the gap by learning a model of the complex physical process\ndirectly from simulation data. However, as data generation through simulations\nis costly, we need to develop models, being cognizant of data paucity issues.\nIn such scenarios it is often helpful if the rich physical knowledge of the\napplication domain is incorporated in the architectural design of machine\nlearning models. Further, we can also use information from physics-based\nsimulations to guide the learning process using aggregate supervision to\nfavorably constrain the learning process. In this paper, we propose PhyDNN, a\ndeep learning model using physics-guided structural priors and physics-guided\naggregate supervision for modeling the drag forces acting on each particle in a\nComputational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method(CFD-DEM). We conduct\nextensive experiments in the context of drag force prediction and showcase the\nusefulness of including physics knowledge in our deep learning formulation both\nin the design and through learning process. Our proposed PhyDNN model has been\ncompared to several state-of-the-art models and achieves a significant\nperformance improvement of 8.46% on average across all baseline models.

In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware fusion\nscheme to effectively fuse inputs that might suffer from a range of known and\nunknown degradations. Specifically, we analyze a number of uncertainty\nmeasures, each of which captures a different aspect of uncertainty, and we\npropose a novel way to fuse degraded inputs by scaling modality-specific output\nsoftmax probabilities.

Two-fluid models provide a good basis in order to conduct\nsuch simulations, even if recent advances allow to refine subscale modeling\nusing geometrical variables in order to reach a unified model including\nseparate phases and disperse phase descriptions based on high order moment\nmethods. The simulation of such models has to rely on dedicated numerical\nmethods and still lacks assessment of its predictive capabilities. The present\npaper constitutes a building block of the investigation of a hierarchy of\ntest-cases designed to be amenable to DNS while close enough to industrial\nconfigurations, for which we propose a comparison of two-fluid compressible\nsimulations with DNS data-bases. We focus in the present contribution on an\nair-assisted water atomization using a planar liquid sheet injector.\nQualitative and quantitative comparisons with incompressible DNS allow us to\nidentify and analyze strength and weaknesses of the reduced-order modeling and\nnumerical approach in this specific configuration and set a framework for more\nrefined models since they already provide a very interesting level of\ncomparison on averaged quantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 13:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 17:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}
