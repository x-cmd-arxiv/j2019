We conducted such single-slab and multi-slab modeling for a\nbroad set of model input parameters and showed the dependence of the Mg II line\nprofiles on these parameters. We demonstrated that the observed line widths of\nthe h and k line profiles are strongly affected by the presence of multiple\nspicules along the LOS.

Recent work has\nshown that control of the twist angle between layers can have a dramatic effect\non vdWH properties. For TMD vdWH, twist angle has been treated solely through\nthe use of rigid-lattice moir\\'e patterns. No atomic reconstruction, i.e. any\nrearrangement of atoms within the individual layers, has been reported\nexperimentally to date.

Reconstructing haplotypes of an\nindividual from short sequencing reads is an NP-hard problem that becomes even\nmore challenging in the case of polyploids. While increasing lengths of\nsequencing reads and insert sizes {\\color{black} helps improve accuracy of\nreconstruction}, it also exacerbates computational complexity of the haplotype\nassembly task. This has motivated the pursuit of algorithmic frameworks capable\nof accurate yet efficient assembly of haplotypes from high-throughput\nsequencing data.\n  Results: We propose a novel graphical representation of sequencing reads and\npose the haplotype assembly problem as an instance of community detection on a\nspatial random graph. To this end, we construct a graph where each read is a\nnode with an unknown community label associating the read with the haplotype it\nsamples. Haplotype reconstruction can then be thought of as a two-step\nprocedure: first, one recovers the community labels on the nodes (i.e., the\nreads), and then uses the estimated labels to assemble the haplotypes. Based on\nthis observation, we propose ComHapDet - a novel assembly algorithm for diploid\nand ployploid haplotypes which allows both bialleleic and multi-allelic\nvariants.\n  Conclusions: Performance of the proposed algorithm is benchmarked on\nsimulated as well as experimental data obtained by sequencing Chromosome $5$ of\ntetraploid biallelic \\emph{Solanum-Tuberosum} (Potato).

We demonstrate that these equations can accurately fit experimental data\nwithin normal experimental ranges of rate.

These drops in brightness are reminiscent of the light curves of R\nCorona Borealis variables, but with much smaller decreases in brightness, and\nare likely due to transient dust obscuration. Its SED is very similar to that\nof the unusual oxygen-rich giant star HDE 233517, which possesses mid-infrared\nhydrocarbon emission features. These two non-PPNe turn out to members of the\nrare group of giant stars with large mid-infrared excesses due to dust, objects\nwhich presumably have interesting evolutionary histories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 18:48:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

A fundamental\nproblem is to map an arbitrary matrix to a memristor crossbar array (MCA) while\nmaximizing the resulting computational accuracy. The state-of-the-art mapping\ntechnique is based on a heuristic that only guarantees to produce the correct\noutput for two input vectors. In this paper, a technique that aims to produce\nthe correct output for every input vector is proposed, which involves\nspecifying the memristor conductance values and a scaling factor realized by\nthe peripheral circuitry. The key insight of the paper is that the conductance\nmatrix realized by an MCA is only required to be proportional to the target\nmatrix. The selection of the scaling factor between the two regulates the\nutilization of the programmable memristor conductance range and the\nrepresentability of the target matrix. Consequently, the scaling factor is set\nto balance precision and value range errors. Moreover, a technique of\nconverting conductance values into state variables and vice versa is proposed\nto handle memristors with non-ideal device characteristics.

These correlations can essentially be encompassed by\na simple scaling relation between observed and baryonic accelerations,\nhistorically known as the Mass Discrepancy Acceleration Relation (MDAR). The\nexistence of such a relation has prompted many theories that attempt to explain\nthe correlations by invoking additional fundamental forces on baryons. The\nstandard lore has been that a theory that reduces to the MDAR on galaxy scales\nbut behaves like cold dark matter (CDM) on larger scales provides an excellent\nfit to data, since CDM is desirable on scales of clusters and above. However,\nthis statement should be revised in light of recent results showing that a\nfundamental force that reproduces the MDAR is challenged by local Milky Way\ndynamics and rotation curve data between 5-18 kpc. In this study, we test this\nclaim on the example of Superfluid Dark Matter.

One\nindispensable technique for investigating these fast evolutions is temporal\nimaging systems. However, just as conventional spatial imaging systems are\nincapable of capturing depth information of a three-dimensional scene, typical\ntemporal imaging systems also lack this ability to retrieve depth information;\ndifferent dispersions in a complex pulse. Therefore, enabling temporal imaging\nsystems to provide these information with great detail would add a new facet to\nthe analysis of ultrafast pulses. In this paper, after discussing how spatial\nthree-dimensional integral imaging could be generalized to the time domain, two\ndistinct methods have been proposed in order to compensate for its shortcomings\nsuch as relatively low depth resolution and limited depth-of-field. The first\nmethod utilizes a curved time-lens array instead of a flat one, which leads to\nan improved viewing zone and depth resolution, simultaneously. The second one\nwhich widens the depth-of-field is based on the non-uniformity of focal lengths\nof time-lenses in the time-lens array. It has been shown that compared with\nconventional setup for temporal integral imaging, depth resolution, i.e.\ndispersion resolvability, and depth-of-field, i.e. the range of resolvable\ndispersions, have been improved by a factor of 2.5 and 1.87, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 19:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Furthermore, we demonstrate the\nimportance of the phonon-mode dependent electron-phonon coupling for the\nrelaxation process and reveal the significance of this channel in the lattice\nequilibration through an indirect coupling between phonons via the electronic\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 20:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

In this paper, we analyze\na high-resolution N-body simulation of a Milky Way-type galaxy to study the\nrole that the slowing down of a stellar bar has is generating migration from\nthe inner to the outer disk. Stellar particles are trapped by the main\nresonances (corotation and Outer Lindblad resonance) which then propagate\noutwards across the disk due to the bar slowing down. Once the bar strength\nreaches its maximal amplitude, some of the stars, delivered to the outer disk,\nescape the resonances and some of them settle on nearly circular orbits. The\nnumber of the escaped stars gradually increases also due to the decrease of the\nbar strength when the boxy/peanut bulge forms. We show that this mechanism is\nnot limited only to stars on nearly circular orbits: also stars initially on\nmore eccentric orbits can be transferred outwards (out to the OLR location) and\ncan end up on nearly circular orbits. Therefore, the propagation of the bar\nresonances outwards can induce the circularization of the orbits of some of the\nmigrating stars. The mechanism investigated in this paper can explain the\npresence of metal-rich stars at the solar vicinity and more generally in the\nouter galactic disk. Our dynamical model predicts that up to 3% of stars in\nbetween of corotation and the OLR can be formed in the innermost region of the\nMilky Way.

In this paper we demonstrate a method to\ndirectly measure the midplane gas temperature from an optically thick molecular\nline, if the disk is moderately inclined. The only model assumption that enters\nis that the line is very optically thick, also in the midplane region where we\nwish to measure the temperature.

We\nfocus on time-series with long-range dependencies, needed for monitoring fine\ngranularity data (e.g. minutes, seconds, milliseconds), prevalent in\noperational use-cases.\n  Traditional models, such as auto-regression fitted with least squares\n(Classic-AR) can model time-series with a concise and interpretable model. When\ndealing with long-range dependencies, Classic-AR models can become intractably\nslow to fit for large data. Recently, sequence-to-sequence models, such as\nRecurrent Neural Networks, which were originally intended for natural language\nprocessing, have become popular for time-series. However, they can be overly\ncomplex for typical time-series data and lack interpretability.\n  A scalable and interpretable model is needed to bridge the statistical and\ndeep learning-based approaches. As a first step towards this goal, we propose\nmodelling AR-process dynamics using a feed-forward neural network approach,\ntermed AR-Net. We show that AR-Net is as interpretable as Classic-AR but also\nscales to long-range dependencies.\n  Our results lead to three major conclusions: First, AR-Net learns identical\nAR-coefficients as Classic-AR, thus being equally interpretable. Second, the\ncomputational complexity with respect to the order of the AR process, is linear\nfor AR-Net as compared to a quadratic for Classic-AR. This makes it possible to\nmodel long-range dependencies within fine granularity data. Third, by\nintroducing regularization, AR-Net automatically selects and learns sparse\nAR-coefficients. This eliminates the need to know the exact order of the\nAR-process and allows to learn sparse weights for a model with long-range\ndependencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 21:47:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-02"}

Our key insight is that anchor points should be optimized jointly as a\ngroup both within and across feature pyramid levels. We propose a simple yet\neffective training strategy with soft-weighted anchor points and soft-selected\npyramid levels to address the false attention issue within each pyramid level\nand the feature selection issue across all the pyramid levels, respectively. To\nevaluate the effectiveness, we train a single-stage anchor-free detector called\nSoft Anchor-Point Detector (SAPD). Experiments show that our concise SAPD\npushes the envelope of speed/accuracy trade-off to a new level, outperforming\nrecent state-of-the-art anchor-free and anchor-based detectors. Without bells\nand whistles, our best model can achieve a single-model single-scale AP of\n47.4% on COCO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 22:26:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 00:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

To encode various connection patterns between neighbour words,\nconnection-attention adaptively imposes different weights specified to\nneighbourhoods of each word, which captures the short-term dependencies. On the\nother hand, the hop-attention applies scaled coefficients to different scopes\nduring the graph diffusion process to make the model learn more about the\ndistribution of context, which captures long-term semantics in an adaptive way.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on five widely used datasets to evaluate\nour dual-attention GCN, and the achieved state-of-the-art performance verifies\nthe effectiveness of dual-attention mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 02:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-02"}

In this regard, independent reinforcement learning (IRL) is often\ndeployed in multi-agent collaboration to alleviate the problem of a\nnon-stationary learning environment. However, behavioral strategies of\nintelligent agents in IRL can only be formulated upon their local individual\nobservations of the global environment, and appropriate communication\nmechanisms must be introduced to reduce their behavioral localities. In this\npaper, we address the problem of communication between intelligent agents in\nIRL by jointly adopting mechanisms with two different scales. For the large\nscale, we introduce the stigmergy mechanism as an indirect communication bridge\nbetween independent learning agents, and carefully design a mathematical method\nto indicate the impact of digital pheromone. For the small scale, we propose a\nconflict-avoidance mechanism between adjacent agents by implementing an\nadditionally embedded neural network to provide more opportunities for\nparticipants with higher action priorities. In addition, we present a federal\ntraining method to effectively optimize the neural network of each agent in a\ndecentralized manner.

However, iCI scales exponentially with respect to\nthe numbers of electrons and orbitals. The problem can be mitigated by\nobserving that a vast number of configurations have little weights in the wave\nfunction and do not contribute to the correlation energy. The real questions\nare then (a) how to identify important configurations in the early stage of the\ncalculation and (b) how to account for the residual contributions of those\nunimportant configurations. It is generally true that if a high-quality yet\ncompact variational space can be determined for describing the static\ncorrelation, a low-order treatment of the residual dynamic correlation would be\nsufficient. While this is common to all selected CI schemes, the `iCI with\nselection' scheme presented here has the following distinctive features: (1)\nFull spin symmetry is maintained.

The structured correlations among the body parts, which are\nessential for understanding complex human actions, are not fully exploited. To\naddress the problem, we propose a pose-based graph convolutional network\n(PGCN), which encodes the body-part features into a human-based spatiotemporal\ngraph, and explicitly models their correlations with a novel light-weight\nadaptive graph convolutional module to produce a highly discriminative\nrepresentation for human action recognition.

Our aim is to estimate the intergalactic medium transmission towards\nUV-selected star-forming galaxies at redshift 4 and above and study the effect\nof the dust attenuation on these measurements.\n  Methods. The ultra-violet spectrum of high redshift galaxies is a combination\nof their intrinsic emission and the effect of the Inter-Galactic medium (IGM)\nabsorption along their line of sight. Using data coming from the unprecedented\ndeep spectroscopy from the VANDELS ESO public survey carried out with the VIMOS\ninstrument we compute both the dust extinction and the mean transmission of the\nIGM as well as its scatter from a set of 281 galaxies at z>3.87. Because of a\ndegeneracy between the dust content of the galaxy and the IGM, we first\nestimate the stellar dust extinction parameter E(B-V) and study the result as a\nfunction of the dust prescription. Using these measurements as constraint for\nthe spectral fit we estimate the IGM transmission Tr(Lyalpha). Both photometric\nand spectroscopic SED fitting are done using the SPectroscopy And photometRy\nfiTting tool for Astronomical aNalysis (SPARTAN) that is able to fit the\nspectral continuum of the galaxies as well as photometric data.\n  Results. Using the classical Calzetti's attenuation law we find that E(B-V)\ngoes from 0.11 at z=3.99 to 0.08 at z=5.15. These results are in very good\nagreement with previous measurements from the literature. We estimate the IGM\ntransmission and find that the transmission is decreasing with increasing\nredshift from Tr(Lyalpha)=0.53 at z=3.99 to 0.28 at z=5.15. We also find a\nlarge standard deviation around the average transmission that is more than 0.1\nat every redshift.

Although\nthe incentive model for federated learning has not been fully developed, it is\nsupposed that participants are able to get rewards or the privilege to use the\nfinal global model, as a compensation for taking efforts to train the model.\nTherefore, a client who does not have any local data has the incentive to\nconstruct local gradient updates in order to deceive for rewards.

The hypothesis of a current BBH is effectively\nruled out on the grounds that its merger time must be a small fraction of the\ncurrent age of the B star. The hypothesis of a previous BBH that merged to\ncreate the current dark mass is also effectively ruled out by the low orbital\neccentricity, due to the combination of mass loss and kick resulted from\ngravitational wave emission in any past merger.

The experiments are conducted using flow visualization\nand planar particle image velocimetry (PIV) with fog particles for two\ndifferent cavity regimes of VPC, i.e., open cavity (OC) and two-branch cavity\n(TBC), under various range of free stream velocity (U) and ventilation rates\n(Q). Our experiments reveal similar flow patterns for both OC and TBC,\nincluding forward flow region near the air-water interface, reverse flow\nregion, near-cavitator vortex, and internal flow circulation vortex. However,\nOC internal flow exhibits highly unsteady internal flow features, while TBC\ninternal flow shows laminar-like flow patterns with a Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability developed at the interface between forward and reverse flow regions\nwithin the cavity. Internal flow patterns and the unsteadiness of OC resemble\nthose of turbulent flow separation past a backward-facing step (BFS flow),\nsuggesting a strong coupling of internal flow and turbulent external\nrecirculation region for OC. Likewise, internal flow patterns of TBC resemble\nthose of laminar BFS flow, with the presence of unsteadiness due to the strong\nvelocity gradient across the forward-reverse flow interface. The variation of\nthe internal flow upon changing U or Q is further employed to explain the\ncavity regime transition and the corresponding change of cavity geometry. Our\nstudy suggests that ventilation control can potentially stabilize the cavity in\nthe TBC regime by delaying its internal flow regime transition from\nlaminar-like to highly unsteady.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 08:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Recently, this method has been improved using filter-driven DFWM,\nwhich exploits both the filtering and nonlinear features of silica microring\nresonators. However, the fabrication complexity and coupling loss between\nwaveguides and fibers are problematics. In this study, we demonstrate a tens to\nhundreds of gigahertz stable pulsed all-fiber laser based on the hybrid\nplasmonic microfiber knot resonator device.

However, it\nmodels distinct driving variations in a single network, which increases\nlearning complexity and is less adaptive for modular integration. In this\npaper, we re-investigate human's driving style and propose to learn an\nintermediate driving intention region to relax difficulties in end-to-end\napproach. The intention region follows both road structure in image and\ndirection towards goal in public route planner, which addresses visual\nvariations only and figures out where to go without conventional precise\nlocalization. Then the learned visual intention is projected on vehicle local\ncoordinate and fused with reliable obstacle perception to render a navigation\nscore map widely used for motion planning. The core of the proposed system is a\nweakly-supervised cGAN-LSTM model trained to learn driving intention from human\ndemonstration. The adversarial loss learns from limited demonstration data with\none local planned route and enables reasoning of multi-modal behavior with\ndiverse routes while testing. Comprehensive experiments are conducted with\nreal-world datasets. Results show the proposed paradigm can produce more\nconsistent motion commands with human demonstration, and indicates better\nreliability and robustness to environment change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 09:25:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-02"}

Recently several\ntypes of excitonic lasers have been reported based on Transition metal\ndichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers, however, the emission is still the intrinsic\nenergy bandgap of the monolayers and lasers harnessing the flexibility of Van\nder Waals heterostructures have not been demonstrated yet.

The onset of lasing action was identified by a combination of\ndistinct kink in the 'L-L' curve and the noticeable collapse of spectral\nlinewidth. Different from visible emission of intralayer excitons for both MoS2\nand WSe2, our interlayer exciton laser works in the infrared range, which is\nfully compatible with the well-established technologies in silicon photonics.\nThanks to the long lifetime of interlayer excitons, the requirement of the\ncavity quality factor is relaxed by orders of magnitude.

With increasing concentration of PAMH both the zero-shear-rate\nviscosity ($\\eta_0$) and the infinite-shear-rate viscosity ($\\eta_{\\infty}$)\nincrease.

We generate vortex rings using a piston-cylinder mechanism in a\nglass tank and measure vortex ring properties such as ring position, ring\ncirculation, enstrophy, kinetic energy and peak vorticity using particle image\nvelocimetry (PIV). Experiments are conducted by (1) matching impulse, and (2)\nmatching Reynolds number. We show that, at constant impulse, vortex ring\nproperties in PAMH solution deviate from that in Newtonian water.

The recent availability of\nlarge amounts of data allows us to envision the construction of new approaches\nfor understanding this coupling between transport and population growth. Here,\nwe use a detailed dataset for about 36000 municipalities in France from 1968\nuntil now.

We also show that growth\nrate differences due to accessibility are very small and can mostly be observed\nfor cities that experienced very large accessibility variations. This suggests\nthat the relevant variable for explaining growth rate variations is not the\naccessibility but its temporal variation.

The atmosphere model is based on the radiative\ntransfer with Eddington's two-stream approximation. Two opacity cases are\nconsidered: the first introduces a greenhouse effect and the second exhibits a\nstrong temperature inversion. We find that for the predominant thermal bulges\nexcited by g-modes of lower orders, our results are qualitatively similar to\nthe adiabatic results from Arras and Socrates (2010). It arises because the\nperturbed heating due to self-absorption of thermal emissions can be\nsignificant (i.e., greenhouse effect) against Newtonian damping, thereby\nleading to almost undamped thermal bulges. We also find that the contribution\nto the thermal bulge from the evanescent waves in the convective zone is not\nnegligible, implying that the thermal bulge is not merely confined in the\natmosphere and radiative envelope.

However, although handcrafted and deep\nlearning-inspired facial features reached a significant level of compactness\nand expressive power, the facial recognition performance still suffers from\nintra-class variations such as ageing, facial expressions, lighting changes,\nand pose. These variations cannot be captured in a single acquisition and\nrequire multiple acquisitions of long duration, which are expensive and need a\nhigh level of collaboration from the users. Among others, self-update\nalgorithms have been proposed in order to mitigate these problems.\nSelf-updating aims to add novel templates to the users' gallery among the\ninputs submitted during system operations. Consequently, computational\ncomplexity and storage space tend to be among the critical requirements of\nthese algorithms. The present paper deals with the above problems by a novel\ntemplate-based self-update algorithm, able to keep over time the expressive\npower of a limited set of templates stored in the system database. The\nrationale behind the proposed approach is in the working hypothesis that a\ndominating mode characterises the features' distribution given the client.\nTherefore, the key point is to select the best templates around that mode. We\npropose two methods, which are tested on systems based on handcrafted features\nand deep-learning-inspired autoencoders at the state-of-the-art. Three\nbenchmark data sets are used.

More precisely, for a Gro\\-thendieck\ncosmos---that is, a bicomplete Grothendick category $\\mathcal{V}$ with a closed\nsymmetric monoidal structure---we prove that the geometrically pure exact\ncategory $(\\mathcal{V},\\mathscr{E}_\\otimes)$ has enough relative injectives; in\nfact, every object has a geometrically pure injective envelope. We also show\nthat for some regular cardinal $\\lambda$, the tensor embedding yields an exact\nequivalence between $(\\mathcal{V},\\mathscr{E}_\\otimes)$ and the category of\n$\\lambda$-cocontinuous $\\mathcal{V}$-functors from $\\mbox{Pres}(\\mathcal{V})$\nto $\\mathcal{V}$, where the former is the full $\\mathcal{V}$-subcategory of\n$\\lambda$-presentable objects in $\\mathcal{V}$.

This is achieved by performing two\npolynomial approximations at each interstitial point. The polynomials are\ncoupled by constraining their coefficients to ensure continuity of the model up\nto the (n-1)-th derivative; while yielding an estimate for the discontinuity of\nthe n-th derivative. The coefficients of the polynomials correspond directly to\nthe derivatives of the approximations at the interstitial points through the\nprudent selection of a common coordinate system. The approximation residual and\nextrapolation errors are investigated as measures for detecting discontinuity.\nThis is necessary since discrete observations of continuous systems are\ndiscontinuous at every point. It is proven, using matrix algebra, that positive\nextrema in the combined approximation-extrapolation error correspond exactly to\nextrema in the difference of the Taylor coefficients. This provides a relative\nmeasure for the severity of the discontinuity in the observational data. The\nmatrix algebraic derivations are provided for all aspects of the methods\npresented here; this includes a solution for the covariance propagation through\nthe computation.

In the\nstudied model, the UAVs can simultaneously provide communications and\nillumination to service ground users. Since ambient illumination increases the\ninterference over VLC links while reducing the illumination threshold of the\nUAVs, it is necessary to consider the illumination distribution of the target\narea for UAV deployment optimization. This problem is formulated as an\noptimization problem which jointly optimizes UAV deployment, user association,\nand power efficiency while meeting the illumination and communication\nrequirements of users. To solve this problem, an algorithm that combines the\nmachine learning framework of gated recurrent units (GRUs) with convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) is proposed. Using GRUs and CNNs, the UAVs can model the\nlong-term historical illumination distribution and predict the future\nillumination distribution. Given the prediction of illumination distribution,\nthe original nonconvex optimization problem can be divided into two\nsub-problems and is then solved using a low-complexity, iterative algorithm.\nThen, the proposed algorithm enables UAVs to determine the their deployment and\nuser association to minimize the total transmit power. Simulation results using\nreal data from the Earth observations group (EOG) at NOAA/NCEI show that the\nproposed approach can achieve up to 68.9% reduction in total transmit power\ncompared to a conventional optimal UAV deployment that does not consider the\nillumination distribution and user association.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 03:03:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 08:01:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 14:08:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

As a by-product, we also provide a\nrigorous justification of the well-known relationship between diffusion maps\nand the Neumann eigenvalue problems. We then use a recently developed method of\nestimating the distance to boundary function (notice that the boundary location\nis assumed to be unknown and must be estimated from data) in order to correct\nthe boundary error term in the diffusion maps construction.

However, current CNN models still exhibit a\npoor ability to be invariant to spatial transformations of images. Intuitively,\nwith sufficient layers and parameters, hierarchical combinations of convolution\n(matrix multiplication and non-linear activation) and pooling operations should\nbe able to learn a robust mapping from transformed input images to\ntransform-invariant representations. In this paper, we propose randomly\ntransforming (rotation, scale, and translation) feature maps of CNNs during the\ntraining stage. This prevents complex dependencies of specific rotation, scale,\nand translation levels of training images in CNN models. Rather, each\nconvolutional kernel learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for\nproducing the transform-invariant answer given the combinatorially large\nvariety of transform levels of its input feature maps. In this way, we do not\nrequire any extra training supervision or modification to the optimization\nprocess and training images. We show that random transformation provides\nsignificant improvements of CNNs on many benchmark tasks, including small-scale\nimage recognition, large-scale image recognition, and image retrieval.

To solve the above problem, we propose SEEF-ALDR, a novel Speaker\nEmbedding Enhancement Framework via Adversarial Learning based Disentangled\nRepresentation, to reinforce the performance of existing models on speaker\nverification. The key idea is to retrieve as much speaker identity information\nas possible from the original speech, thus minimizing the impact of\nidentity-unrelated information on the speaker verification task by using\nadversarial learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nframework can significantly improve the performance of speaker verification by\n20.3% and 23.8% on average over 13 tested baselines on dataset Voxceleb1 and 8\ntested baselines on dataset Voxceleb2 respectively, without adjusting the\nstructure or hyper-parameters of them.

The use of\nmodels to analyse the underlying processes is a well-known practice. However,\ndue to the complexity and continuous evolution of their processes,\norganizations need an effective way of analysing the relation between processes\nand models. Conformance checking techniques asses the suitability of a process\nmodel in representing an underlying process, observed through a collection of\nreal executions. One important metric in conformance checking is to asses the\nprecision of the model with respect to the observed executions, i.e.,\ncharacterize the ability of the model to produce behavior unrelated to the one\nobserved. In this paper we present the notion of anti-alignment as a concept to\nhelp unveiling runs in the model that may deviate significantly from the\nobserved behavior. Using anti-alignments, a new metric for precision is\nproposed. In contrast to existing metrics, anti-alignment based precision\nmetrics satisfy most of the required axioms highlighted in a recent\npublication. Moreover, a complexity analysis of the problem of computing\nanti-alignments is provided, which sheds light into the practicability of using\nanti-alignment to estimate precision.
