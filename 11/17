The system aims to propose a model for adaptive learning\nenvironments where two major concerns arising from past studies are being\naddressed; the marginal role of the teacher, and the need for a big data\napproach. Most past studies marginalized the teacher role in adaptive learning\nsystem, particularly the online ones. The most notable quality about ALGS is\nempowering the teacher with the capability of having input in all stages. This\nis where the hybrid recommendation system plays a crucial role in the 3-stage\nALGS architecture. The second issue addressed is the need for big data to\nenhance the system functionality. The more the data collected by the system,\nthe more efficient its adaptation functionality which makes it difficult for a\nfirst-time-run system and (or) a first-time user. Accordingly, collaborative\nfiltering is used at first until adequate data about the user interaction are\ncollected. ALGS architecture consists of a user, content, and 3-stage\nadaptation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2019 13:15:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

One drawback of standard DNNs is that they are prone to\ncatastrophic forgetting. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a commonly used\ntechnique to alleviate this problem. In this paper, we demonstrate it can\nindeed help the model to output more discriminative results within old classes.\nHowever, it cannot alleviate the problem that the model tends to classify\nobjects into new classes, causing the positive effect of KD to be hidden and\nlimited. We observed that an important factor causing catastrophic forgetting\nis that the weights in the last fully connected (FC) layer are highly biased in\nclass incremental learning. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective\nsolution motivated by the aforementioned observations to address catastrophic\nforgetting. Firstly, we utilize KD to maintain the discrimination within old\nclasses. Then, to further maintain the fairness between old classes and new\nclasses, we propose Weight Aligning (WA) that corrects the biased weights in\nthe FC layer after normal training process. Unlike previous work, WA does not\nrequire any extra parameters or a validation set in advance, as it utilizes the\ninformation provided by the biased weights themselves. The proposed method is\nevaluated on ImageNet-1000, ImageNet-100, and CIFAR-100 under various settings.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method can effectively alleviate\ncatastrophic forgetting and significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Nov 2019 16:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

One of\nthem is XO-6b, which orbits an F5V-type star. Shortly after the discovery, we\nstarted multicolor photometric and radial-velocity follow-up observations of\nXO-6b, using the telescopes of Astronomical Institute of the Slovak Academy of\nSciences. Our main scientific goals were to better characterize the planetary\nsystem and to search for transit timing variations. We refined several\nplanetary and orbital parameters. Based on our measurements, the planet XO-6b\nseems to be about 10% larger, which is, however, only about $2\\sigma$\ndifference, but its orbit inclination angle, with respect to the plane of the\nsky, seems to be significantly smaller, than it was determined originally by\nthe discoverers. In this case we found about $9.5\\sigma$ difference. Moreover,\nwe observed periodic transit timing variations of XO-6b with a semi-amplitude\nof about 14 min and with a period of about 450 days. There are two plausible\nexplanations of such transit timing variations: (1) a third object in the\nsystem XO-6 causing light-time effect, or (2) resonant perturbations between\nthe transiting planet XO-6b and another unknown low-mass planet in this system.\nFrom the O-C diagram we derived that the assumed third object in the system\nshould have a stellar mass, therefore significant variations are expected in\nthe radial-velocity measurements of XO-6. Since this is not the case, and since\nall attempts to fit radial velocities and O-C data simultaneously failed to\nprovide a consistent solution, more realistic is the second explanation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Nov 2019 16:15:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In the resulting models, the\nstatistical distribution of frequencies determines the process spectrum while\nthe distribution of amplitudes governs the process distributional properties.\nSince decoupling the distributional and spectral properties can be advantageous\nin applications, we thoroughly investigate a variety of properties exhibited by\nthese models. We extend previous work that represented processes as finite sum\nof harmonics, by conveniently embedding them into the class of harmonizable\nprocesses. Harmonics are integrated with respect to independently scattered\nsecond order non-Gaussian random measures. The proposed approach provides with\na proper mathematical framework that allows to study spectral, distributional,\nand ergodic properties. The mathematical elegance of these representations\navoids serious conceptual and technical difficulties with limiting behavior of\nthe models while at the same time facilitates derivation of their fundamental\nproperties.

The electrophysiological signals present three\ntypes of wave: oscillations, spikes, and a mixture of both. Recent studies\nprove that spikes and oscillations should be separated efficiently to define\nthe accurate neural connectivity for each activity. However retrieving the\ntransitory activity is a sensitive task due to the frequency interfering\nbetween the gamma oscillatory and the transitory activities.

The first of these questions is\nthe study of the optimal value of the problem as a function of the involved\nparameters. For this sensitivity analysis problem, we provide formulas for the\nderivatives of the value function with respect to the parameters and illustrate\ntheir application on an inventory problem. Since these formulas involve optimal\ndual solutions, we need an algorithm that computes such solutions to use them.\nIn this context, the second question we address is the study of solution\nmethods for the dual problem. Writing Dynamic Programming (DP) equations for\nthe dual, we can use an SDDP type method, called Dual SDDP, which solves these\nDP equations. However, applying this method will only be possible if the\nRelatively Complete Recourse (RCR) holds for the dual. Since the RCR assumption\nmay fail to hold, we design two variants of Dual SDDP, namely Dual SDDP with\npenalizations and Dual SDDP with feasibility cuts. The study of this second\nquestion allows us to take a fresh look at the notoriously difficult to solve\nclass of MSLP with interstage dependent cost coefficients. Indeed, for this\nclass of problems, cost-to-go functions are non-convex and solution methods\nwere so far using SDDP for a Markov chain approximation of the cost\ncoefficients process. For these problems, we propose to apply Dual SDDP with\npenalizations to the cost-to-go functions of the dual which are concave. This\nalgorithm converges to the optimal value of the problem. Finally, as a proof of\nconcept of the tools developed, we present the results of numerical experiments\ncomputing the sensitivity of the optimal value of an inventory problem as a\nfunction of parameters of the demand process and compare Primal and Dual SDDP\non the inventory and a hydro-thermal planning problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Nov 2019 18:59:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2020 03:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

Analytical calculations and computer\nsimulations, performed in the limit of equal load sharing, revealed that\ndepending on the disorder parameters the mechanical response of the bundle is\neither perfectly brittle where the first fiber breaking triggers a catastrophic\navalanche, or it is quasi-brittle where macroscopic failure is preceded by a\nsequence of bursts. In the quasi-brittle phase, the statistics of avalanche\nsizes is found to show a high degree of complexity. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that the functional form of the size distribution of bursts depends\non the system size: for large upper cutoffs of fibers' strength, in small\nsystems the sequence of bursts has a high degree of stationarity characterized\nby a power law size distribution with a universal exponent.

Thus far, successful\nmodel-inversion attacks have only been demonstrated on simple models, such as\nlinear regression and logistic regression. Previous attempts to invert neural\nnetworks, even the ones with simple architectures, have failed to produce\nconvincing results. We present a novel attack method, termed the generative\nmodel-inversion attack, which can invert deep neural networks with high success\nrates. Rather than reconstructing private training data from scratch, we\nleverage partial public information, which can be very generic, to learn a\ndistributional prior via generative adversarial networks (GANs) and use it to\nguide the inversion process. Moreover, we theoretically prove that a model's\npredictive power and its vulnerability to inversion attacks are indeed two\nsides of the same coin---highly predictive models are able to establish a\nstrong correlation between features and labels, which coincides exactly with\nwhat an adversary exploits to mount the attacks.

An approach\nto the critical point is characterized in terms of divergence of zero shear\nviscosity and the subsequent appearance of the low frequency modulus. In the\nvicinity of the critical gel state, both the viscosity and the modulus show a\npower-law dependence on relative distance from the critical point.\nInterestingly, the longest relaxation time has been observed to diverge\nsymmetrically on both the sides of the critical point and also shows a\npower-law dependence on relative distance from the critical point.

Researches on social network evolution mainly focus on the follow\nbehavior, while the unfollow behavior has largely been ignored. Mining unfollow\nbehavior is challenging because user's decision on unfollow is not only\naffected by the simple combination of user's attributes like informativeness\nand reciprocity, but also affected by the complex interaction among them.\nMeanwhile, prior datasets seldom contain sufficient records for inferring such\ncomplex interaction. To address these issues, we first construct a large-scale\nreal-world Weibo dataset, which records detailed post content and relationship\ndynamics of 1.8 million Chinese users. Next, we define user's attributes as two\ncategories: spatial attributes (e.g., social role of user) and temporal\nattributes (e.g., post content of user). Leveraging the constructed dataset, we\nsystematically study how the interaction effects between user's spatial and\ntemporal attributes contribute to the unfollow behavior. Afterwards, we propose\na novel unified model with heterogeneous information (UMHI) for unfollow\nprediction. Specifically, our UMHI model: 1) captures user's spatial attributes\nthrough social network structure; 2) infers user's temporal attributes through\nuser-posted content and unfollow history; and 3) models the interaction between\nspatial and temporal attributes by the nonlinear MLP layers. Comprehensive\nevaluations on the constructed dataset demonstrate that the proposed UMHI model\noutperforms baseline methods by 16.44% on average in terms of precision.

Based on the submitted rankings, the\nsocial choice rule chooses a winning candidate; the quality of the winner is\nthe sum of the (unknown) distances to the voters. The rule's choice will in\ngeneral be suboptimal, and the worst-case ratio between the cost of its chosen\ncandidate and the optimal candidate is called the rule's distortion. It was\nshown in prior work that every deterministic rule has distortion at least 3,\nwhile the Copeland rule and related rules guarantee worst-case distortion at\nmost 5; a very recent result gave a rule with distortion $2+\\sqrt{5} \\approx\n4.236$.\n  We provide a framework based on LP-duality and flow interpretations of the\ndual which provides a simpler and more unified way for proving upper bounds on\nthe distortion of social choice rules. We illustrate the utility of this\napproach with three examples. First, we give a fairly simple proof of a strong\ngeneralization of the upper bound of 5 on the distortion of Copeland, to social\nchoice rules with short paths from the winning candidate to the optimal\ncandidate in generalized weak preference graphs. A special case of this result\nrecovers the recent $2+\\sqrt{5}$ guarantee. Second, using this generalized\nbound, we show that the Ranked Pairs and Schulze rules have distortion\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt(n))$. Finally, our framework naturally suggests a combinatorial\nrule that is a strong candidate for achieving distortion 3, which had also been\nproposed in recent work. We prove that the distortion bound of 3 would follow\nfrom any of three combinatorial conjectures we formulate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2019 06:34:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 06:53:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2019 19:18:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

The\nclock rate of an FPGA-mapped design is set based on worst-case conditions to\nensure reliable operation under all circumstances. This usually leaves a\nconsiderable timing margin that can be exploited to reduce power consumption by\nscaling voltage without lowering clock frequency. There are hurdles for such\nopportunistic voltage scaling in FPGAs because (a) critical paths change with\ndesigns, making timing evaluation difficult as voltage changes, (b) each FPGA\nresource has particular power-delay trade-off with voltage, (c) data corruption\nof configuration cells and memory blocks further hampers voltage scaling. In\nthis paper, we propose a systematical approach to leverage the available\nthermal headroom of FPGA-mapped designs for power and energy improvement. By\ncomprehensively analyzing the timing and power consumption of FPGA building\nblocks under varying temperatures and voltages, we propose a thermal-aware\nvoltage scaling flow that effectively utilizes the thermal margin to reduce\npower consumption without degrading performance.

Lastly, we\npropose a simulation framework to be able to examine the efficiency of the\nproposed method for other applications that are inherently tolerant to a\ncertain amount of error, granting further power saving opportunity.\nExperimental results over a set of industrial benchmarks indicate up to 36%\npower reduction with the same performance, and 66% total energy saving when\nenergy is the optimization target.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2019 09:01:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

As a result,\nwe move away from a strict one-loop calculation and consequently mix orders in\nperturbation theory. Moreover, determination of the loop-corrected masses in an\niterative procedure also results in the mixing of different loop orders. Gauge\ndependence then arises from the mismatch with tree-level Goldstone boson\ncouplings that are applied in the loop calculation, and from the gauge\ndependence of the loop-corrected masses themselves. We find that the gauge\ndependence is significant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2019 09:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Recent work has explored different\nwatermarking techniques to protect the pre-trained deep neural networks from\npotential copyright infringements. However, these techniques could be\nvulnerable to watermark removal attacks. In this work, we propose REFIT, a\nunified watermark removal framework based on fine-tuning, which does not rely\non the knowledge of the watermarks, and is effective against a wide range of\nwatermarking schemes. In particular, we conduct a comprehensive study of a\nrealistic attack scenario where the adversary has limited training data, which\nhas not been emphasized in prior work on attacks against watermarking schemes.\nTo effectively remove the watermarks without compromising the model\nfunctionality under this weak threat model, we propose two techniques that are\nincorporated into our fine-tuning framework: (1) an adaption of the elastic\nweight consolidation (EWC) algorithm, which is originally proposed for\nmitigating the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon; and (2) unlabeled data\naugmentation (AU), where we leverage auxiliary unlabeled data from other\nsources. Our extensive evaluation shows the effectiveness of REFIT against\ndiverse watermark embedding schemes. In particular, both EWC and AU\nsignificantly decrease the amount of labeled training data needed for effective\nwatermark removal, and the unlabeled data samples used for AU do not\nnecessarily need to be drawn from the same distribution as the benign data for\nmodel evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that our fine-tuning\nbased watermark removal attacks could pose real threats to the copyright of\npre-trained models, and thus highlight the importance of further investigating\nthe watermarking problem and proposing more robust watermark embedding schemes\nagainst the attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2019 10:30:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 06:39:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 08:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

Iterative phase retrieval allows\nquantitatively correct and twin-image-free reconstructions of object amplitude\nand phase distributions from its in-line hologram. The present work derives the\nquantitative criteria on how many holograms are required to reconstruct a\ncomplex-valued object distribution, be it a 2D or 3D sample. It is shown that\nfor a sample that can be approximated as a 2D sample, a single-shot in-line\nhologram is sufficient to reconstruct the absorption and phase distributions of\nthe sample. Previously, the GS-based algorithms have been successfully employed\nto reconstruct samples that are limited to a 2D plane. However, realistic\nphysical objects always have some finite thickness and therefore are 3D rather\nthan 2D objects. This study demonstrates that 3D samples, including 3D phase\nobjects, can be reconstructed from two or more holograms. It is shown that in\nprinciple, two holograms are sufficient to recover the entire wavefront\ndiffracted by a 3D sample distribution. In this method, the reconstruction is\nperformed by applying iterative phase retrieval between the planes where\nintensity was measured. The recovered complex-valued wavefront is then\npropagated back to the sample planes, thus reconstructing the 3D distribution\nof the sample.

To achieve that, a Gaussian proposal\ndistribution is augmented with a Gaussian Process (GP) surface that helps\ncapture non-linearities in the log-likelihood function.

The second consists of a measure based on\nthe relative variance of sample weights obtained from sampling the approximate\nposterior probability distribution of the model parameters.

These resonators are commonly fabricated from an optical\nfiber by variation of its radius. Generally, variation of the bottle\nmicroresonator (BMR) radius along the fiber axis can be quite complex\npresenting, e.g., a series of coupled BMRs positioned along the fiber. Similar\nto optical spherical and toroidal microresonators, BMRs support whispering\ngallery modes (WGMs) which are localized inside the resonator due to the effect\nof total internal reflection. The elongation of BMRs along the fiber axis\nenables their several important properties and applications not possible to\nrealize with other optical microresonators. The paper starts with the review of\nthe BMR theory, which includes their spectral properties, slow WGM propagation\nalong BMRs, theory of Surface Nanoscale Axial Photonics (SNAP) BMRs, theory of\nresonant transmission of light through BMR microresonators coupled to\ntransverse waveguides (microfibers), theory of nonstationary WGMs in BMRs, and\ntheory of nonlinear BMRs. Next, the fabrication methods of BMRs including\nmelting of optical fibers, fiber annealing in SNAP technology, rolling of\nsemiconductor bilayers, solidifying of a UV-curable adhesive, and others are\nreviewed.

As in the complex case,\nwe use the Berberian extension to study some properties of the commutator of\ntwo quaternionic bounded right linear operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 2019 09:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

While single-factor authentication is well known to be a\nweak form of authentication, a further concern arises when considering the\npossibility for an attacker to recover the user passwords by leveraging the\nloopholes in the password recovery mechanisms. Indeed, the adoption by a\nWeb-site of a poor password management system makes useless even the most\nrobust password chosen by the registered users. In this paper, building on the\nresults of our previous work, we study the possible attacks to on-line password\nrecovery systems analyzing the mechanisms implemented by some of the most\npopular Web-sites. In detail, we provide several contributions: (i) we revise\nand detail the attacker model; (ii) we provide an updated analysis with respect\nto a preliminary study we carried out in December 2017; (iii) we perform a\nbrand new analysis of the current top 200 Alexa's Web-sites of five major EU\ncountries; and, (iv) we propose \\sol, a working open-source module that could\nbe adopted by any Web-site to provide registered users with a password recovery\nmechanism to prevent mail service provider-level attacks.

However,\nthe self-attention mechanism is not without its own flaws. Although\nself-attention can model extremely long dependencies, the attention in deep\nlayers tends to overconcentrate on a single token, leading to insufficient use\nof local information and difficultly in representing long sequences. In this\nwork, we explore parallel multi-scale representation learning on sequence data,\nstriving to capture both long-range and short-range language structures. To\nthis end, we propose the Parallel MUlti-Scale attEntion (MUSE) and MUSE-simple.\nMUSE-simple contains the basic idea of parallel multi-scale sequence\nrepresentation learning, and it encodes the sequence in parallel, in terms of\ndifferent scales with the help from self-attention, and pointwise\ntransformation. MUSE builds on MUSE-simple and explores combining convolution\nand self-attention for learning sequence representations from more different\nscales. We focus on machine translation and the proposed approach achieves\nsubstantial performance improvements over Transformer, especially on long\nsequences. More importantly, we find that although conceptually simple, its\nsuccess in practice requires intricate considerations, and the multi-scale\nattention must build on unified semantic space. Under common setting, the\nproposed model achieves substantial performance and outperforms all previous\nmodels on three main machine translation tasks. In addition, MUSE has potential\nfor accelerating inference due to its parallelism.
