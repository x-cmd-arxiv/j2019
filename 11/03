Our approach is formulated as a classical\nEinstein-vector-scalar-Maxwell-fluid field theory on a spacetime with\nthree-sphere spatial sections. Analytic cosmological solutions are found using\nlocal charts familiar from standard LFRW cosmological models. These solutions\ncan be used to describe different types of evolution for the metric scale\nfactor, the Hubble, jerk and de-acceleration functions, the scalar spacetime\ncurvature and the Kretschmann invariant. The cosmological sector of the theory\naccommodates a particular single big-bang scenario followed by an eternal\nexponential acceleration of the scale factor. Such a solution does not require\nan externally prescribed fluid equation of state and leads to a number of new\npredictions including a current value of the \"jerk\" parameter, \"Hopfian-like\"\nsource-free Maxwell field configurations with magnetic helicity and\ndistributional \"bi-polar\" solutions exhibiting a new charge conjugation\nsymmetry. An approximate scheme for field perturbations about this particular\ncosmology is explored and its consequences for a thermalisation process and a\nthermal history are derived, leading to a prediction of the time interval\nbetween the big-bang and the decoupling era. Finally it is shown that field\ncouplings exist where both vector and scalar localised linearised perturbations\nexhibit dispersive wave-packet behaviours. The scalar perturbation may also\ngive rise to Yukawa solutions associated with a massive Klein-Gordon particle.\nIt is argued that the vector and scalar fields may offer candidates for\n\"dark-energy\" and \"dark-matter\" respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Nov 2019 11:43:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

To broaden the application scenarios of\ndifferential privacy when data records have dependencies, the notion of\nBayesian differential privacy has been recently proposed. However, it is\nunknown whether Bayesian differential privacy preserves three nice properties\nof differential privacy: sequential composability, parallel composability, and\npost-processing. In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to this\nquestion; i.e., Bayesian differential privacy still have these properties. The\nidea behind sequential composability is that if we have $m$ algorithms $Y_1,\nY_2, \\ldots, Y_m$, where $Y_{\\ell}$ is independently $\\epsilon_{\\ell}$-Bayesian\ndifferential private for ${\\ell}=1,2,\\ldots,m$, then by feeding the result of\n$Y_1$ into $Y_2$, the result of $Y_2$ into $Y_3$, and so on, we will finally\nhave an $\\sum_{\\ell=1}^m \\epsilon_{\\ell}$-Bayesian differential private\nalgorithm. For parallel composability, we consider the situation where a\ndatabase is partitioned into $m$ disjoint subsets. The $\\ell$-th subset is\ninput to a Bayesian differential private algorithm $Y_{\\ell}$, for\n${\\ell}=1,2,\\ldots,m$. Then the parallel composition of $Y_1$, $Y_2$, $\\ldots$,\n$Y_m$ will be $\\max_{\\ell=1}^m \\epsilon_{\\ell}$-Bayesian differential private.\nThe post-processing property means that a data analyst, without additional\nknowledge about the private database, cannot compute a function of the output\nof a Bayesian differential private algorithm and reduce its privacy guarantee.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2019 18:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

For instance, the training\nset is used to learn a predictor, and then the holdout set is used for\nestimating the accuracy of the predictor on the true distribution. However,\noften in practice, the holdout dataset is reused and the estimates tested on\nthe holdout dataset are chosen adaptively based on the results of prior\nestimates, leading to that the predictor may become dependent of the holdout\nset. Hence, overfitting may occur, and the learned models may not generalize\nwell to the unseen datasets. Prior studies have established connections between\nthe stability of a learning algorithm and its ability to generalize, but the\ntraditional generalization is not robust to adaptive composition. Recently,\nDwork et al. in NIPS, STOC, and Science 2015 show that the holdout dataset from\ni.i.d. data samples can be reused in adaptive statistical learning, if the\nestimates are perturbed and coordinated using techniques developed for\ndifferential privacy, which is a widely used notion to quantify privacy.

Specifically, we show that the\nholdout dataset from correlated samples can be reused in adaptive statistical\nlearning, if the estimates are perturbed and coordinated using techniques\ndeveloped for Bayesian differential privacy, which is a privacy notion recently\nintroduced by Yang et al. in SIGMOD 2015 to broaden the application scenarios\nof differential privacy when data records are correlated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2019 18:45:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

The representation of 3D surfaces itself is a key\nfactor for the quality and resolution of the 3D output. While explicit\nrepresentations, such as point clouds and voxels, can span a wide range of\nshape variations, their resolutions are often limited. Mesh-based\nrepresentations are more efficient but are limited by their ability to handle\nvarying topologies. Implicit surfaces, however, can robustly handle complex\nshapes, topologies, and also provide flexible resolution control. We address\nthe fundamental problem of learning implicit surfaces for shape inference\nwithout the need of 3D supervision. Despite their advantages, it remains\nnontrivial to (1) formulate a differentiable connection between implicit\nsurfaces and their 2D renderings, which is needed for image-based supervision;\nand (2) ensure precise geometric properties and control, such as local\nsmoothness. In particular, sampling implicit surfaces densely is also known to\nbe a computationally demanding and very slow operation. To this end, we propose\na novel ray-based field probing technique for efficient image-to-field\nsupervision, as well as a general geometric regularizer for implicit surfaces,\nwhich provides natural shape priors in unconstrained regions. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our framework on the task of single-view image-based 3D\nshape digitization and show how we outperform state-of-the-art techniques both\nquantitatively and qualitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2019 19:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

One of the major advantages of EVPN over legacy layer 2 VPN solutions is\nproviding All-Active (A-A) mode of operation so that the traffic can truly be\nmulti-homed on Provider Edge (PE) routers. However, A-A mode of operation\nintroduces new challenges. In the case where the Customer Edge (CE) router is\nmulti-homed to one or more PE routers, it is necessary that only one of the PE\nrouters should forward Broadcast, Unknown unicast, and Multicast (BUM) traffic\ninto the DC. The PE router that assumes the primary role for forwarding BUM\ntraffic to the CE device is called the Designated Forwarder (DF). The proposed\nsolution to select the DF in the EVPN standard is based on a distributed\nalgorithm which has a number of drawbacks such as unfairness and intermittent\nbehavior.

We exploit the spectral properties of weighted graph\nLaplacians and output performance matrices to derive a novel method of\ncomputing the closed-form solutions for this general class of performance\nmetrics, which include H2-norm based quantities as special cases. We then\nexplore the effect of the interplay between network properties (e.g. edge\ndirectionality and connectivity) and the control strategy on the overall\nnetwork performance. More precisely, for systems whose interconnection is\ndescribed by graphs with normal Laplacian L, we characterize the role of\ndirectionality by comparing their performance with that of their undirected\ncounterparts, represented by the Hermitian part of L. We show that, for\nsingle-integrator networks, directed and undirected graphs perform identically.\nHowever, for double-integrator networks, graph directionality -- expressed by\nthe eigenvalues of L with nonzero imaginary part -- can significantly degrade\nperformance. Interestingly in many cases, well-designed feedback can also\nexploit directionality to mitigate degradation or even improve the performance\nto exceed that of the undirected case.

This new framework is motivated by the\nobservation that minimum-cost flow only partially models the data association\nproblem and must be accompanied by an additional and time-consuming searching\nscheme to determine the optimal object number. By employing a minimum-cost\ncirculation framework, we eliminate the searching step and naturally integrate\nthe number of objects into the optimization problem. By exploring the special\nproperty of the associated graph, that is, an overwhelming majority of the\nvertices are with unit capacity, we designed an implementation of the framework\nand proved it has the best theoretical complexity so far for the global data\nassociation problem. We evaluated our method with 40 experiments on five MOT\nbenchmark datasets. Our method was always the most efficient and averagely 53\nto 1,192 times faster than the three state-of-the-art methods. When our method\nserved as a sub-module for global data association methods using higher-order\nconstraints, similar efficiency improvement was attained. We further\nillustrated through several case studies how the improved computational\nefficiency enables more sophisticated tracking models and yields better\ntracking accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2019 23:28:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 17:14:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

However, these pristine\nsamples of space material are incredibly rare. Less than 40 of the 60,000\nmeteorites held in collections around the world have known dynamical origins.\nFireball networks have been developed globally in a unified effort to increase\nthis number by using multiple observatories to record, triangulate, and\ndynamically analyse ablating meteoroids as they enter our atmosphere. The\naccuracy of the chosen meteoroid triangulation method directly influences the\naccuracy of the determined orbit and the likelihood of possible meteorite\nrecovery.\n  There are three leading techniques for meteoroid triangulation discussed in\nthe literature: the Method of Planes, the Straight Line Least Squares method,\nand the Multi-Parameter Fit method.

This approach uses\nthe meteoroid's 3D dynamic equations of motion to fit a realistic trajectory\ndirectly to multi-sensor line-of-sight observations. This method has the\nability to resolve fragmentation events, fit systematic observatory timing\noffsets, and determine mass estimates of the meteoroid along its observable\ntrajectory.\n  Through a comprehensive Monte-Carlo analysis of over 100,000 trajectory\nsimulations, we find this new method to more accurately estimate meteoroid\ntrajectories of slow entry events ($<$25\\,km/s) and events observed from low\nconvergence angles ($<$10$^{\\circ}$) compared to existing meteoroid\ntriangulation techniques.

Model compression has been\nproposed as a promising technique to improve the running efficiency via\nparameter and operation reduction. Whereas, this technique is mainly practiced\nin ANNs rather than SNNs. It is interesting to answer how much an SNN model can\nbe compressed without compromising its functionality, where two challenges\nshould be addressed: i) the accuracy of SNNs is usually sensitive to model\ncompression, which requires an accurate compression methodology; ii) the\ncomputation of SNNs is event-driven rather than static, which produces an extra\ncompression dimension on dynamic spikes. To this end, we realize a\ncomprehensive SNN compression through three steps. First, we formulate the\nconnection pruning and weight quantization as a constrained optimization\nproblem. Second, we combine spatio-temporal backpropagation (STBP) and\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the problem with\nminimum accuracy loss.

To push throughput\nbeyond this single-replica limit, we propose concurrent consensus. In\nconcurrent consensus, replicas independently propose transactions, thereby\nreducing the influence of any single replica on performance. To put this idea\nin practice, we propose our RCC paradigm that can turn any primary-backup\nconsensus protocol into a concurrent consensus protocol by running many\nconsensus instances concurrently.

This poses the issue of\ndeveloping energy-efficient HVAC control, i.e., reduce energy use (cost) while\nsimultaneously enhancing human comfort. This paper pursues the objective and\nstudies the stochastic optimal HVAC control subject to uncertain thermal demand\n(i.e., the weather and occupancy etc). Particularly, we involve the elaborate\npredicted mean vote (PMV) thermal comfort model in the optimization. The\nproblem is computationally challenging due to the non-linear and non-analytical\nconstraints imposed by the system dynamics and PMV model. We make the following\ncontributions to address it. First, we formulate the problem as a Markov\ndecision process (MDP) which is a desirable modeling technique capable of\nhandling the complexities. Second, we propose a gradient-based learning (GB-L)\nmethod for progressively learning a stochastic control policy off-line and\nstore it for on-line execution. Third, we prove the learning method converge to\nthe optimal policies theoretically, and its performance (i.e., energy cost,\nthermal comfort and on-line computation) for HVAC control via simulations. The\ncomparisons with the existing model predictive control based relaxation (MPC-R)\nmethod which is assumed with accurate future information and supposed to\nprovide the near-optimal bounds, show that though there exists some performance\nloss in energy cost reduction (i.e., 6.5%), the proposed method can enable\nefficient on-line implementation (less than 1 second) and provide high\nprobability of thermal comfort under uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Nov 2019 06:17:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 06:24:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 05:05:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-05"}

NH2-terminated graphene nanoplatelets, NH2 GNPs,\nprepared by a diazonium coupling were used as a platform to covalently graft\nPMMA chains to the surface of graphene through an amidation between the NH2\ngroups and PMMA chains, PMMA NH GNPs.

Furthermore, Tg and Td of PMMA were increased by 15 C and 29 C,\nrespectively, by adding 5 wt of PMMA NH GNPs, whereas incorporating unmodified\nGNPs led to smaller increases.

In\neach iteration of FL (called round), the edge devices update local models based\non their own data and contribute to the global training by uploading the model\nupdates via wireless channels. Due to the limited spectrum resources, only a\nportion of the devices can be scheduled in each round. While most of the\nexisting work on scheduling focuses on the convergence of FL w.r.t. rounds, the\nconvergence performance under a total training time budget is not yet explored.\nIn this paper, a joint bandwidth allocation and scheduling problem is\nformulated to capture the long-term convergence performance of FL, and is\nsolved by being decoupled into two sub-problems. For the bandwidth allocation\nsub-problem, the derived optimal solution suggests to allocate more bandwidth\nto the devices with worse channel conditions or weaker computation\ncapabilities. For the device scheduling sub-problem, by revealing the trade-off\nbetween the number of rounds required to attain a certain model accuracy and\nthe latency per round, a greedy policy is inspired, that continuously selects\nthe device that consumes the least time in model updating until achieving a\ngood trade-off between the learning efficiency and latency per round. The\nexperiments show that the proposed policy outperforms other state-of-the-art\nscheduling policies, with the best achievable model accuracy under training\ntime budgets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Nov 2019 09:37:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

Such a model would be very useful, as it would allow the\nexistence and non-existence of vulnerabilities, and soundness of\ncountermeasures to be formally established.\n  In this paper we present such a model targeting single core processors. The\nmodel is intentionally very general and provides an infrastructure to define\nmodels of real CPUs. It incorporates microarchitectural features that underpin\nall known Spectre vulnerabilities. We use the model to elucidate the security\nof existing and new vulnerabilities, as well as to formally analyze the\neffectiveness of proposed countermeasures. Specifically, we discover three new\n(potential) vulnerabilities, including a new variant of Spectre v4, a\nvulnerability on speculative fetching, and a vulnerability on out-of-order\nexecution, and analyze the effectiveness of three existing countermeasures:\nconstant time, Retpoline, and ARM's Speculative Store Bypass Safe (SSBS).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Nov 2019 11:13:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 13:06:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

However, it is very difficult to detect this disorder in them,\nsince the breathing motion of children tends to change when they reach an age\nof 6. This, thus makes it very difficult to monitor their respiratory state\neasily. In this paper, we present a cheap non-contact alternative to the\ncurrent methods that are available. This is using a stereo camera, that\ncaptures a video of the patient breathing at a frame rate of 30Hz. For further\nprocessing, the captured video has to be rectified and converted into a point\ncloud. The obtained point clouds need to be aligned in order to have the output\nwith respect to a common plane. They are then converted into a surface mesh.\nThe depth is further estimated by subtracting every point cloud from the\nreference point cloud (the first frame). The output data, however, when plotted\nwith respect to real time produces a very noisy plot. This is filtered by\ndetermining the signal frequency by taking the Fast Fourier Transform of the\nbreathing signal. The system was tested under 4 different breathing conditions:\ndeep, shallow and normal breathing and while coughing. On its success, it was\ntested with mixed breathing (combination of normal and shallow breathing) and\nwas lastly compared with the output of the expensive 3dMD system. The\ncomparison showed that using the stereo camera, we can reach to similar\nsensitivity for respiratory motion observation. The experimental results show\nthat, the proposed method provides a major step towards development of low-cost\nhome-based observation systems for asthma patients and care-givers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Nov 2019 12:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

Several frameworks for this learning with rejection have been proposed\nin the literature. However, most of them work for classification problems only\nand regression with rejection has not been studied in much detail. In this\nwork, we present a neural framework for LWR based on a generalized meta-loss\nfunction that involves simultaneous training of two neural network models: a\npredictor model for generating predictions and a rejecter model for deciding\nwhether the prediction should be accepted or rejected.

The existing repertoire of approaches to solve\nthis inverse problem is built on iterative phase-retrieval algorithms, which do\nnot take optical aberrations and deviations from theoretical models into\naccount.

The interface states are analyzed with respect to Zak phases\nand surface impedances. The retainability of the interface states in\nrectangular lattice PCs is investigated by studying the relationship between\nthe length-width ratio of the rectangular lattice and the Zak phase.

According to RAR, humor can be expressed in a simple formula:\n-d(A)/dt. RAR has strong correspondences with False Alarm Theory, Benign\nViolation Theory, and Cognitive Debugging Theory, all of which represent either\nspecial cases or partial descriptions at alternative levels of analysis. Some\nevidence for RAR includes physiological similarities between hyperventilation\nand laughter and the fact that smiles often indicate negative affect in\nnon-human primates (e.g. fear grimaces where teeth are exposed as a kind of\ninhibited threat display). In accordance with Benign Violation Theory, if humor\nreliably indicates both a) anxiety induction, b) anxiety reduction, and c) the\ntime-course over which anxiety is reduced, then the intersection of these\nconditions productively constrains inference spaces over latent mental states\nwith respect to the values and capacities of the persons experiencing humor. In\nthis way, humor is a powerful cypher for understanding persons in both\nindividual and social contexts, with far-reaching implications. Finally, if\nhumor can be expressed in such a simple formula with clear ties to\nphenomenology, and yet this discovery regarding such an essential part of the\nhuman experience has remained undiscovered for this long, then this is an\nextremely surprising state of affairs worthy of further investigation.

In UrbanRhythm, we extract staying,\nleaving, arriving three attributes of mobility and use a image processing\nmethod Saak transform to calculate the mobility distribution feature. For the\nsecond question, several city states are identified by hierarchy clustering as\nthe basic components of urban dynamics, such as sleeping states and working\nstates. We further characterize the urban dynamics as the transform of city\nstates along time axis. For the third question, we directly observe the\nlong-term periodicity of urban dynamics from visualization. Then for the\nshort-term regularity, we design a novel motif analysis method to discovery\nmotifs as well as their hierarchy relationships. We evaluate our proposed\nsystem on two real-life datesets and validate the results according to App\nusage records. This study sheds light on urban dynamics hidden in human\nmobility and can further pave the way for more complicated mobility behavior\nmodeling and deeper urban understanding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Nov 2019 02:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-14"}

We provide\nintuition as well as a formal analysis showing how these multiscale\ndistributions limit the stepsize of leapfrog and we show how the implicit\nmidpoint method can be used, together with Newton-Krylov iteration, to\ncircumvent this limitation and achieve major efficiency gains. Furthermore, we\noffer practical guidelines for when to choose between implicit midpoint and\nleapfrog and what stepsize to use for each method, depending on the\ndistribution being sampled. Unlike previous modifications to HMC, our method is\ngenerally applicable to highly non-Gaussian distributions exhibiting multiple\nscales.

With the progress of\nautomation in this arena, it needs to be diagnosed for better performance and\nless failures. There are several options for doing that but we have seen from\nthe past research that using Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) as the diagnosis\nframework would be the most promising option due to its diverse benefits.\nSeveral challenges such as effect of noise, lower speed, selective node\nreplacement, complexity of logistics, and limited battery lifetime arise while\nusing WSN as the framework. Limited battery lifetime has become one of the most\nsignificant issues to focus on to get rid of it. This article provides a model\nfor replenishing the battery charge of the sensor nodes of wireless sensor\nnetwork. We will use the model for sensor battery recharging in an efficient\nway so that no nodes become out of service after a while. We will be using\nmobile charger for this purpose. So, there may be some scope for improving the\nrecharge interval for the mobile charger as well. This will be satisfied using\noptimum path calculation for each time the charger travels to the nodes. Our\nmain objectives are to maximize the nodes battery utilization, distribute power\neffectively from the energy harvester, and minimize the distance between power\nsource and cluster head. The simulation results show that the proposed approach\nsuccessfully maximizes the utilization of the nodes battery while minimizes the\nwaiting time for the sensor nodes to get recharged from the energy harvester.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2019 19:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

However, the success of mobile crowdsourcing relies on\nbalancing the supply and demand by first accurately forecasting spatially and\ntemporally the supply-demand gap, and then providing efficient incentives to\nencourage participant movements to maintain the desired balance. In this paper,\nwe propose Deep-Gap, a deep learning approach based on residual learning to\npredict the gap between mobile crowdsourced service supply and demand at a\ngiven time and space. The prediction can drive the incentive model to achieve a\ngeographically balanced service coverage in order to avoid the case where some\nareas are over-supplied while other areas are under-supplied. This allows\nanticipating the supply-demand gap and redirecting crowdsourced service\nproviders towards target areas. Deep-Gap relies on historical supply-demand\ntime series data as well as available external data such as weather conditions\nand day type (e.g., weekday, weekend, holiday). First, we roll and encode the\ntime series of supply-demand as images using the Gramian Angular Summation\nField (GASF), Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF) and the Recurrence Plot\n(REC). These images are then used to train deep Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNN) to extract the low and high-level features and forecast the crowdsourced\nservices gap. We conduct comprehensive comparative study by establishing two\nsupply-demand gap forecasting scenarios: with and without external data.\nCompared to state-of-art approaches, Deep-Gap achieves the lowest forecasting\nerrors in both scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Nov 2019 17:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}
