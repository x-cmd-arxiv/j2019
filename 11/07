As a resolution, we present a new surrogate optimization\napproach by addressing two gaps in prior research -- unimportant input\nvariables and inefficient treatment of uncertainty associated with the\nblack-box output. We first design a new flexible non-interpolating parsimonious\nsurrogate model using a partitioning-based multivariate adaptive regression\nsplines approach, Tree Knot MARS (TK-MARS). The proposed model is specifically\ndesigned for optimization by capturing the structure of the function, bending\nat near-optimal locations, and is capable of screening unimportant input\nvariables. Furthermore, we develop a novel replication approach called\n\\emph{Smart-Replication}, to overcome the uncertainty associated with the\nblack-box output. The Smart-Replication approach identifies promising input\npoints to replicate and avoids unnecessary evaluations of other data points.\nSmart-Replication is agnostic to the choice of a surrogate and can adapt itself\nto an unknown noise level. Finally to demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed approaches we consider different complex global optimization test\nfunctions from the surrogate optimization literature. The results indicate that\nTK-MARS outperforms original MARS within a surrogate optimization algorithm and\nsuccessfully detects important variables. The results also show that although\nnon-interpolating surrogates can mitigate uncertainty, replication is still\nbeneficial for optimizing highly complex black-box functions. The robustness\nand the quality of the final optimum solution found through Smart-Replication\nare competitive with that using no replications in environments with low levels\nof noise and using a fixed number of replications in highly noisy environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 16:13:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 03:47:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 17:01:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 15:55:32 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 16:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-10"}

First, their past trajectories are modelled under gravitational\nscattering by galactic components ('disk heating') to assess how far back one\ncan trace them. The stochastic nature of disk heating means that a\nback-integration can only expect to be accurate to within 15 pc and 2\nkms$^{-1}$ at -10 Myr, dropping steeply to 400 pc and 10 kms$^{-1}$ at -100\nMyr, sharply limiting our ability to determine a precise origin. Nevertheless,\nwe show `Oumuamua's origin system is likely currently within 1 kpc of Earth, in\nthe local Orion Arm. Second, we back-integrate 'Oumuamua's trajectory to assess\nsource regions, emphasizing young systems and moving groups. Though disk\nheating allows for only a statistical link to source regions, `Oumuamua passed\nthrough a considerable subset of the Carina and Columba moving groups when\nthose groups were forming.

In order to be more\nrealistic, a fitness parameter $\\eta_i \\in [0,1]$ for each node $i$ of the\nnetwork is also taken into account to reflect the ability of the nodes to\nattract new ones. Our d-dimensional model takes into account the geographical\ndistances between nodes, with different probability distribution for $\\eta$\nwhich sensibly modifies the growth dynamics.

Our next result is the $\\NP$-hardness of\nmembership testing in the minrank variety, hence we establish the\n$\\NP$-hardness of the orbit closure containment problem for 3-tensors.\n  Algebraic natural proofs were recently introduced by Forbes, Shpilka and Volk\nand independently by Grochow, Kumar, Saks and Saraf. Bl\\\"aser et al. gave a\nversion of an algebraic natural proof barrier for the matrix completion problem\nwhich relies on $\\coNP \\subseteq \\exists \\BPP$. It implied that constructing\nequations for the corresponding variety should be hard. We generalize their\napproach to work with any family of varieties for which the membership problem\nis $\\NP$-hard and for which we can efficiently generate a dense subset.\nTherefore, a similar barrier holds for the slice rank and the minrank\nvarieties, too. This allows us to set up the slice rank and the minrank\nvarieties as a test-bed for geometric complexity theory (GCT). We determine the\nstabilizers of the tensors that generate the orbit closures of the two\nvarieties and prove that these tensors are almost characterized by their\nsymmetries. We prove several nontrivial equations for both the varieties using\ndifferent GCT methods. Many equations also work in the regime where membership\ntesting in the slice rank or minrank varieties is $\\NP$-hard. We view this as a\npromising sign that the GCT approach might indeed be successful.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 18:14:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-07"}

Their results have the advantage that the quantum circuit is\nfairly practical, and their proofs are free of hardness assumptions (e.g.,\nfactoring is classically hard, etc.). Unfortunately, constant-depth classical\ncircuits are too weak to yield a convincing real-world demonstration of quantum\nadvantage. We attempt to hold on to the advantages of the above results, while\nincreasing the power of the classical model.\n  Our main result is a two-round interactive task which is solved by a\nconstant-depth quantum circuit (using only Clifford gates, between neighboring\nqubits of a 2D grid, with Pauli measurements), but such that any classical\nsolution would necessarily solve $\\oplus$L-hard problems. This implies a more\npowerful class of constant-depth classical circuits (e.g., AC$^0[p]$ for any\nprime $p$) unconditionally cannot perform the task. Furthermore, under standard\ncomplexity-theoretic conjectures, log-depth circuits and log-space Turing\nmachines cannot perform the task either.\n  Using the same techniques, we prove hardness results for weaker complexity\nclasses under more restrictive circuit topologies. Specifically, we give\nQNC$^0$ interactive tasks on $2 \\times n$ and $1 \\times n$ grids which require\nclassical simulations of power NC$^1$ and AC$^{0}[6]$, respectively.

As the\nscope of these systems increase to cover more scenarios and domains, manual\nannotation to improve the accuracy of these components becomes prohibitively\ncostly and time consuming. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages\nuser-system interaction feedback signals to automate learning without any\nmanual annotation. Users here tend to modify a previous query in hopes of\nfixing an error in the previous turn to get the right results. These\nreformulations, which are often preceded by defective experiences caused by\nerrors in ASR, NLU, ER or the application. In some cases, users may not\nproperly formulate their requests (e.g. providing partial title of a song), but\ngleaning across a wider pool of users and sessions reveals the underlying\nrecurrent patterns. Our proposed self-learning system automatically detects the\nerrors, generate reformulations and deploys fixes to the runtime system to\ncorrect different types of errors occurring in different components of the\nsystem. In particular, we propose leveraging an absorbing Markov Chain model as\na collaborative filtering mechanism in a novel attempt to mine these patterns.\nWe show that our approach is highly scalable, and able to learn reformulations\nthat reduce Alexa-user errors by pooling anonymized data across millions of\ncustomers. The proposed self-learning system achieves a win/loss ratio of 11.8\nand effectively reduces the defect rate by more than 30% on utterance level\nreformulations in our production A/B tests. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first self-learning large-scale conversational AI system in production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 18:55:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-07"}

However, it is insufficient to consider\nonly [Mg/Fe] when estimating the SFT. The [Mg/Fe] yield of a stellar population\ndepends on its metallicity. Therefore, it is possible for galaxies with\ndifferent SFTs and at the same time different total metallicity to have the\nsame [Mg/Fe]. This effect has not been properly taken into consideration in\nprevious studies. In this study, we assume the galaxy-wide stellar initial mass\nfunction (gwIMF) to be canonical and invariant.

Unlike conventional switching\nmethods, which extract astronomical signals by subtracting the reference\nspectra of off-sources from those of on-sources, the FMLO method does not need\nto obtain any off-source spectra; rather, it estimates them from the on-source\nspectra themselves. The principle is a high dump-rate (10 Hz) spectroscopy with\nradio frequency modulation (FM) achieved by fast sweeping of a local oscillator\n(LO) of a heterodyne receiver: Because sky emission (i.e., off-source)\nfluctuates as $1/f$-type and is spectrally correlated, it can be estimated and\nsubtracted from time-series spectra (a timestream) by principal component\nanalysis. Meanwhile astronomical signals remain in the timestream since they\nare modulated to a higher time-frequency domain. The FMLO method therefore\nachieves (1) a remarkably high observation efficiency, (2) reduced spectral\nbaseline wiggles, and (3) software-based sideband separation. We developed an\nFMLO system for the Nobeyama 45-m telescope and a data reduction procedure for\nit. Frequency modulation was realized by a tunable and programmable first local\noscillator. With observations of Galactic sources, we demonstrate that the\nobservation efficiency of the FMLO method is dramatically improved compared to\nconventional switching methods. Specifically, we find that the time to achieve\nthe same noise level is reduced by a factor of 3.0 in single-pointed\nobservations and by a factor of 1.2 in mapping observations. The FMLO method\ncan be applied to observations of fainter ($\\sim$mK) spectral lines and larger\n($\\sim$deg$^{2}$) mapping. It would offer much more efficient and\nbaseline-stable observations compared to conventional switching methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

The negativity\nvanishes deep in the paramagnetic phase, it is larger at small temperature, and\nit decreases upon increasing the temperature.

The\nvanishing of the negativity defines a \"death line\", which we characterise\nanalytically at small $g$.

Finally, we consider the single-particle\nentanglement and negativity spectra. The vast majority of the levels are\nregular across the transition.

Astrometric gravitational microlensing can be used to determine the\nmass of a single star (the lens) with an accuracy of a few percent.

We want to show how accurately Gaia can determine the mass of the lensing\nstar. Methods.

To this end, we develop the Versatile Integrator for Chemical\nEvolution (VICE), a python package. Starbursts driven by a temporary boost of\ngas accretion rate create loops in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] evolutionary tracks and a peak\nin the stellar [O/Fe] distribution at intermediate values. Bursts driven by a\ntemporary boost of star formation efficiency have a similar effect, and they\nalso produce a population of $\\alpha$-deficient stars during the depressed star\nformation phase that follows the burst. This $\\alpha$-deficient population is\nmore prominent if the outflow rate is tied to a time-averaged star formation\nrate (SFR) instead of the instantaneous SFR. Theoretical models of Sr\nproduction predict a strong metallicity dependence of supernova and asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) star yields, though comparison to data suggests an\nadditional source that is nearly metallicity-independent. Evolution of [Sr/Fe]\nand [Sr/O] during a starburst is complex because of the yield metallicity\ndependence and the multiple timescales in play. Moderate amplitude (10-20\\%)\nsinusoidal oscillations in SFR produce loops in [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] tracks and\nmultiple peaks in [O/Fe] distributions, which could be one source of intrinsic\nscatter in observed sequences. We investigate models that have a factor of ~2\nenhancement of SFR at t = 12 Gyr, as suggest by some recent Milky Way\nobservations. A late episode of enhanced star formation could help explain the\nexistence of young stars with moderate $\\alpha$-enhancements and the\nsurprisingly young median age found for solar metallicity stars in the solar\nneighborhood, while also raising the possibility that this starburst has not\nfully decayed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 19:14:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

Although the capture into bound states\nvia emission of a vector is known to be significant, the capture via scalar\nemission suffers from cancellations that render it important only within narrow\nparameter space. While this is true for neutral scalar mediators, here we show\nthat bound-state formation via emission of a charged scalar can be extremely\nsignificant. To this end, we consider DM charged under a dark $U(1)$ force and\ncoupled also to a light complex scalar that is charged under the same gauge\nsymmetry. We compute the cross-sections for bound-state formation via emission\nof the charged scalar, and show that they can exceed those for capture via\nvector emission, as well as annihilation, by orders of magnitude. This holds\neven for very small values of the DM coupling to the charged scalar, and\nremains true in the limit of global symmetry. We then compute the DM thermal\nfreeze-out, and find that the capture into meta-stable bound states via\nemission of a charged scalar can cause a late period of significant DM\ndepletion.

In this model we have a countable\nnumber of neurons linked together in a network, each of them having a membrane\npotential taking value in the integers, and each of them spiking over time at a\nrate which depends on the membrane potential through some rate function $\\phi$.\nBeside being affected by a spike each neuron can also be affected by leaking.\nAt each of these leak times, which occurs for a given neuron at a fixed rate\n$\\gamma$, the membrane potential of the neuron concerned is spontaneously reset\nto $0$. A wide variety of versions of this model can be considered by choosing\ndifferent graph structures for the network and different activation functions.\nIt was rigorously shown that when the graph structure of the network is the\none-dimensional lattice with a hard threshold for the activation function, this\nmodel presents a phase transition with respect to $\\gamma$, and that it also\npresents a metastable behavior. By the latter we mean that in the sub-critical\nregime the re-normalized time of extinction converges to an exponential random\nvariable of mean 1. It has also been proven that in the super-critical regime\nthe renormalized time of extinction converges in probability to 1. Here, we\ninvestigate numerically a richer class of graph structures and activation\nfunctions. Namely we investigate the case of the two dimensional and the three\ndimensional lattices, as well as the case of a linear function and a sigmoid\nfunction for the activation function. We present numerical evidence that the\nresult of metastability in the sub-critical regime holds for these graphs and\nactivation functions as well as the convergence in probability to $1$ in the\nsuper-critical regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 20:02:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

Good agreement is observed using a variety of controlling\ntechniques, including gas puffing, neutral beam heating, and plasma shaping to\nmodify the pedestal stability boundary and thus the ELM behavior. ELM\nmitigation by pellet pacing was observed to strongly reduce W sputtering by\nflushing C impurities from the pedestal and reducing the divertor target\nelectron temperature. No reduction of W sputtering was observed during the\napplication of resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs), in contrast to the\nprediction of the FSRM. Potential sources of this discrepancy are discussed.\nFinally, the framework of the FSRM is utilized to predict intra-ELM W\nsputtering rates in ITER. It is concluded that W erosion during ELMs in ITER\nwill be caused mainly by free-streaming fuel ions, but free-streaming seeded\nimpurities (N or Ne) may increase the erosion rate significantly if present in\nthe pedestal at even the 1% level.

At the background\nlevel, this degeneracy can be formally understood in terms of a unified dark\nsector Equation of State (EoS) that depends both on the dynamical nature of the\ndark energy (DE) as well as on its interaction with the pressureless dark\nmatter. For linear perturbations, the degeneracy arises for specified DE\npressure perturbations (or sound speed, equivalently) and DE anisotropic\nstress. Specializing to the degeneracy between non-interacting dynamical DE and\ninteracting vacuum DE models, we perform a parameter estimation analysis for a\nrange of dynamical DE parametrizations, where for illustration we explicitly\nbreak the degeneracy at the linear level by adopting a luminal sound speed for\nboth scenarios.

Automatic duplicate question\ndetection (DQD) is the key technology need for question answering systems to\nutilize existing online forums like StackExchange. Existing annotations of\nduplicate questions in such forums are community-driven, making them sparse or\neven completely missing for many domains. Therefore, it is important to\ntransfer knowledge from related domains and tasks. Recently, contextual\nembedding models such as BERT have been outperforming many baselines by\ntransferring self-supervised information to downstream tasks. In this paper, we\napply BERT to DQD and advance it by unsupervised adaptation to StackExchange\ndomains using self-supervised learning.

Our\nalgorithms improve the best known running times of parameterized approximation\nalgorithms for Vertex Cover and $3$-Hitting Set for a wide range of\napproximation ratios. One notable example is a simple parameterized random\n$1.5$-approximation algorithm for Vertex Cover, whose running time of\n$O^*(1.01657^k)$ substantially improves the best known runnning time of\n$O^*(1.0883^k)$ [Brankovic and Fernau, 2013]. For $3$-Hitting Set we present a\nparameterized random $2$-approximation algorithm with running time of\n$O^*(1.0659^k)$, improving the best known $O^*(1.29^k)$ algorithm of [Brankovic\nand Fernau, 2012].\n  The running times of our algorithms are derived from an asymptotic analysis\nof a wide class of two-variable recurrence relations of the form: $$p(b,k) =\n\\min_{1\\leq j \\leq N} \\sum_{i=1}^{r_j} \\bar{\\gamma}_i^j \\cdot p(b-\\bar{b}^j_i,\nk-\\bar{k}_i^j),$$ where $\\bar{b}^j$ and $\\bar{k}^j$ are vectors of natural\nnumbers, and $\\bar{\\gamma}^j$ is a probability distribution over $r_j$\nelements, for $1\\leq j \\leq N$.

The present study\nillustrates that this is not always a safe practice unless one examines if the\nintrinsic bonding mechanism is capable of benefiting from the formation of a\ndistribution of lower symmetry local environments that differ from the\nmacroscopically averaged structure. This can happen either due to positional,\nor due to magnetic symmetry breaking. By removing the constraint of a small\ncrystallographic cell, the energy minimization in the density functional theory\nfinds atomic and spin symmetry breaking, not evident in conventional\ndiffraction experiments but being found by local probes such as pair\ndistribution function analysis.

The Graphical InvaRiant Language (GIRL) can be used to specify\nsoftware requirement structural invariants, with entities and their\nrelationships. Those invariants can then have their consistency evaluated by\nthe Alloy Analyzer, based on a mapping semantics we provide for transforming\nGIRL models into Alloy specifications with no user intervention. With a\nprototypical language editor and transformations implemented into an Eclipse\nplugin, we carried out a qualitative study with requirement analysts working\nfor a government software company in Brazil, to evaluate usability and\neffectiveness of the GIRL-based analysis of real software requirements. The\nparticipants were able to effectively use the underlying formal analysis, since\n79 out of 80 assigned invariants were correctly modeled. While participants\nperceived as low the complexity of learning and using GIRL's simplest,\nset-based structures and relationships, the most complex logical structures,\nsuch as quantification and implication, were challenging. Furthermore, almost\nall post-study evaluations from the participants were positive, especially as a\ntool for discovering requirement inconsistencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 23:37:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

The\ngroups can be understood as a broader aggregation of the conditional average\ntreatment effect (CATE) where the number of groups is set in advance. In\neconomics, this approach is similar to pre-analysis plans. Observational\nstudies are standard in policy evaluation from labour markets, educational\nsurveys and other empirical studies. To control for a potential selection-bias,\nwe implement a doubly-robust estimator in the first stage. We use machine\nlearning methods to learn the conditional mean functions as well as the\npropensity score. The group average treatment effect is then estimated via a\nlinear projection model. The linear model is easy to interpret, provides\np-values and confidence intervals, and limits the danger of finding spurious\nheterogeneity due to small subgroups in the CATE. To control for confounding in\nthe linear model, we use Neyman-orthogonal moments to partial out the effect\nthat covariates have on both, the treatment assignment and the outcome. The\nresult is a best linear predictor for effect heterogeneity based on impact\ngroups. We find that our proposed method has lower absolute errors as well as\nsmaller bias than the benchmark doubly-robust estimator.

Different from previous $K$-theoretical approaches, our approach is a\nhomotopy classification, which enables us to see more topological invariants.\nSpecifically, we considered the classification of non-Hermitian systems with\nseparable band structures. We found that the whole classification set is\ndecomposed into several sectors based on the braiding of energy levels and\ncharacterized by some braid group data. Each sector can be further classified\nbased on the topology of eigenstates (wave functions). Due to the interplay\nbetween energy levels braiding and eigenstates topology, we found some torsion\ninvariants, which only appear in the non-Hermitian world via homotopical\napproach. We further proved that these new topological invariants are unstable\n(fragile), in the sense that adding more bands will trivialize these\ninvariants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2019 01:06:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 20:14:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 2021 06:37:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2022 14:29:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

However, as far as we are aware, there are few\nmethods yet to achieve domain adaptation directly on 3D point cloud data. The\nunique challenge of point cloud data lies in its abundant spatial geometric\ninformation, and the semantics of the whole object is contributed by including\nregional geometric structures. Specifically, most general-purpose DA methods\nthat struggle for global feature alignment and ignore local geometric\ninformation are not suitable for 3D domain alignment. In this paper, we propose\na novel 3D Domain Adaptation Network for point cloud data (PointDAN). PointDAN\njointly aligns the global and local features in multi-level. For local\nalignment, we propose Self-Adaptive (SA) node module with an adjusted receptive\nfield to model the discriminative local structures for aligning domains. To\nrepresent hierarchically scaled features, node-attention module is further\nintroduced to weight the relationship of SA nodes across objects and domains.\nFor global alignment, an adversarial-training strategy is employed to learn and\nalign global features across domains.

As a widely adopted solution, models based on\nFactorization Machines (FMs) are capable of modelling high-order interactions\namong features for effective sparse predictive analytics. As the volume of\nweb-scale data grows exponentially over time, sparse predictive analytics\ninevitably involves dynamic and sequential features. However, existing FM-based\nmodels assume no temporal orders in the data, and are unable to capture the\nsequential dependencies or patterns within the dynamic features, impeding the\nperformance and adaptivity of these methods. Hence, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel Sequence-Aware Factorization Machine (SeqFM) for temporal predictive\nanalytics, which models feature interactions by fully investigating the effect\nof sequential dependencies. As static features (e.g., user gender) and dynamic\nfeatures (e.g., user interacted items) express different semantics, we\ninnovatively devise a multi-view self-attention scheme that separately models\nthe effect of static features, dynamic features and the mutual interactions\nbetween static and dynamic features in three different views. In SeqFM, we\nfurther map the learned representations of feature interactions to the desired\noutput with a shared residual network. To showcase the versatility and\ngeneralizability of SeqFM, we test SeqFM in three popular application scenarios\nfor FM-based models, namely ranking, classification and regression tasks.\nExtensive experimental results on six large-scale datasets demonstrate the\nsuperior effectiveness and efficiency of SeqFM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2019 04:29:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 01:44:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

When $n \\ll\nm/\\log(m)$, computational savings can be achieved. The key challenge is how to\nfind the optimal pre-specified projection directions. This can be obtained by\nminimizing the worse-case difference between the true distance and the\napproximated distance, which can be formulated as a nonconvex optimization\nproblem in a general setting.

Inferential challenges are exacerbated when our parameter of interest\ndiffers from the parameter the trial was designed to target, such as when we\nare interested in estimating the value of a sub-optimal treatment after running\na trial to determine the optimal treatment using a stochastic bandit design. In\nthis context, typical estimators that use inverse propensity weighting to\neliminate sampling bias can be problematic: their distributions become skewed\nand heavy-tailed as the propensity scores decay to zero. In this paper, we\npresent a class of estimators that overcome these issues. Our approach is to\nadaptively reweight the terms of an augmented inverse propensity weighting\nestimator to control the contribution of each term to the estimator's variance.\nThis adaptive weighting scheme prevents estimates from becoming heavy-tailed,\nensuring asymptotically correct coverage. It also reduces variance, allowing us\nto test hypotheses with greater power - especially hypotheses that were not\ntargeted by the experimental design. We validate the accuracy of the resulting\nestimates and their confidence intervals in numerical experiments and show our\nmethods compare favorably to existing alternatives in terms of RMSE and\ncoverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2019 06:15:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 17:44:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 18:09:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 20:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

The problem is also known as the constrained eigenvalue\nproblem in the literature because it becomes an eigenvalue problem if the\nlinear constraint $C^{T}x=b$ is removed. We start by equivalently transforming\nCRQopt into an optimization problem, called LGopt, of minimizing the Lagrangian\nmultiplier of CRQopt, and then an problem, called QEPmin, of finding the\nsmallest eigenvalue of a quadratic eigenvalue problem. Although such\nequivalences has been discussed in the literature, it appears to be the first\ntime that these equivalences are rigorously justified. Then we propose to\nnumerically solve LGopt and QEPmin by the Krylov subspace projection method via\nthe Lanczos process. The basic idea, as the Lanczos method for the symmetric\neigenvalue problem, is to first reduce LGopt and QEPmin by projecting them onto\nKrylov subspaces to yield problems of the same types but of much smaller sizes,\nand then solve the reduced problems by some direct methods, which is either a\nsecular equation solver (in the case of LGopt) or an eigensolver (in the case\nof QEPmin). The resulting algorithm is called the Lanczos algorithm. We perform\nconvergence analysis for the proposed method and obtain error bounds. The\nsharpness of the error bound is demonstrated by artificial examples, although\nin applications the method often converges much faster than the bounds suggest.\nFinally, we apply the Lanczos algorithm to semi-supervised learning in the\ncontext of constrained clustering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2019 06:20:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

The NN\nquery, to find the closest one to a given query point among a set of points, is\nwidely used in applications such as density estimation, pattern classification,\ninformation retrieval and spatial analysis. A direct generalization of the NN\nquery is the k nearest neighbors (kNN) query, where the k closest point are\nrequired to be found. Since NN and kNN problems were raised, many algorithms\nhave been proposed to solve them. It has been indicated in literature that the\nonly method to solve these problems exactly with sublinear time complexity, is\nto filter out the unnecessary spatial computation by using the pre-processing\nstructure, commonly referred to as the spatial index. The recently proposed\nspatial indices available for NN search, are almost constructed through spatial\npartition. These indices are tree-like, and the tree-like hierarchical\nstructure can usually significantly improve the efficiency of NN search.\nHowever, when the data are distributed extremely unevenly, it is difficult to\nsatisfy both the balance of the tree and the non-overlap of the subspace\ncorresponding to the nodes. Thus the acceleration performance of the tree-like\nindices is severely jeopardized. In this paper, we propose a non-tree spatial\nindex which consists of multiple layers of Voronoi diagrams (MVD). This index\ncan entirely avoid the dilemma tree-like structures face, and solve the NN\nproblems stably with logarithmic time complexity. Furthermore, it is convenient\nto achieve kNN search by extending NN search on MVD. In the experiments, we\nevaluate the efficiency of this indexing for both NN search and kNN search by\ncomparing with VoR-tree, R-tree and kd-tree. The experiments indicate that\ncompared to NN search and kNN search with the other three indices, these two\nsearch methods have significantly higher efficiency with MVD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2019 07:57:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

How to collect reliable annotations for multi-label data and\nhow to compute the consensus within budget is an interesting and challenging,\nbut rarely studied, problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to\naccomplish Active Multi-label Crowd Consensus (AMCC).

To achieve an effective\nmulti-label consensus, AMCC models workers' annotations via a linear\ncombination of commonality and individuality, and reduces the impact of\nunreliable workers by assigning smaller weights to the group. To collect\nreliable annotations with reduced cost, AMCC introduces an active crowdsourcing\nlearning strategy that selects sample-label-worker triplets.

(i) The relaxation of density fluctuations proceeds by\nthe particle (density) exchange process, and is diffusive; that is, the\nallowable kinetic paths are strongly restricted by the local conservation law.\n(ii) In normal liquid states, this exchange process is less cooperative, and\nthe diffusion coefficient of density fluctuations $D_c$ is given as $D_c\\sim\n\\lambda^2/\\tau_\\alpha$, where $\\lambda$ is the particle size and $\\tau_\\alpha$\nis the structural relaxation time. On the other hand, in supercooled states the\nrestriction on the kinetic path is more severe with increasing the degree of\nsupercooling, which makes the exchange process more cooperative, resulting in\n$D_c \\sim \\xi_{\\rm d}^2/\\tau_\\alpha$ with $\\xi_{\\rm d}$ being the cooperative\nlength scale. (iii) The molecular dynamics simulation results show that the\nself-diffusion coefficient of the tagged particle, $D_s$, almost coincides with\n$D_c$, suggesting that the collective density diffusion and the particle\ndiffusion closely share the same mechanism: in normal states $D_s$ determines\n$D_c$, but vice versa in supercooled states. This immediately leads to the idea\nthat the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation is not the anomaly in the\nsingle-particle dynamics but reflects the increase in the cooperativity in the\ndensity diffusion at the length scale of $\\xi_{\\rm d}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2019 08:43:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

The acoustic\npressure is expressed as a hypercomplex field and this ansatz is inserted into\na one dimensional wave equation that describes the thermoacoustics of a thin\nannulus. Slow-flow averaging of this wave equation is performed by adapting the\nclassic Krylov-Bogoliubov method to the quaternion field in order to derive a\nsystem of coupled first order differential equations for the four slow-flow\nvariables, i.e. the amplitude, the nature angle, the preferential direction and\nthe temporal phase of the azimuthal thermoacoustic mode.

Nevertheless, conventional\nfully digital beamforming techniques are inapplicable, as they demand a\nseparate radio frequency (RF) chain for each antenna element, which is costly\nand consumes too much energy. Hybrid beamforming is a cost-effective\nalternative, which can significantly reduce the hardware cost and power\nconsumption by employing a small number of RF chains. This paper presents a\nholistic view on hybrid beamforming for 5G and beyond mm-wave systems, based on\na new taxonomy for different hardware structures. We take a pragmatic approach\nand compare different proposals from three key aspects: 1) hardware efficiency,\ni.e., the required hardware components; 2) computational efficiency of the\nassociated beamforming algorithm; and 3) achievable spectral efficiency, a main\nperformance indicator. Through systematic comparisons, the interplay and\ntrade-off among these three design aspects are demonstrated, and promising\ncandidates for hybrid beamforming in future wireless networks are identified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2019 11:10:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 10:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-05"}

The most commonly used cross entropy (CE)\ncriteria is actually an accuracy-oriented objective, and thus creates a\ndiscrepancy between training and test: at training time, each training instance\ncontributes equally to the objective function, while at test time F1 score\nconcerns more about positive examples. In this paper, we propose to use dice\nloss in replacement of the standard cross-entropy objective for data-imbalanced\nNLP tasks. Dice loss is based on the Sorensen-Dice coefficient or Tversky\nindex, which attaches similar importance to false positives and false\nnegatives, and is more immune to the data-imbalance issue. To further alleviate\nthe dominating influence from easy-negative examples in training, we propose to\nassociate training examples with dynamically adjusted weights to deemphasize\neasy-negative examples.Theoretical analysis shows that this strategy narrows\ndown the gap between the F1 score in evaluation and the dice loss in training.\nWith the proposed training objective, we observe significant performance boost\non a wide range of data imbalanced NLP tasks. Notably, we are able to achieve\nSOTA results on CTB5, CTB6 and UD1.4 for the part of speech tagging task; SOTA\nresults on CoNLL03, OntoNotes5.0, MSRA and OntoNotes4.0 for the named entity\nrecognition task; along with competitive results on the tasks of machine\nreading comprehension and paraphrase identification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2019 11:14:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 10:24:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2020 06:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

Purpose of this\nobservational and case-control study was to investigate the association of BMD\nwith the risk of reoperation following instrumented lumbar spinal fusion (LSF).\nFor the observational study, 81 patients were included who received LSF with\nand without augmentation. For the case-control study, 18 patients who had\nreoperation following LSF were matched to 26 patients who did not have\nreoperation (matched by sex, age +/- 5 years, fused levels and\nPMMA-augmentation). Opportunistic BMD screening was performed in perioperative\nCT scans using asynchronous calibration. Mean BMD was compared between patients\nwith and without reoperation in augmented and non-augmented surgeries. In the\nobservational study, prevalence of osteoporosis (BMD < 80 mg/cc) was 29% in\nnon-augmented and 85% in augmented LSF. Seven of 48 patients with non-augmented\n(15%) and 4 of 33 patients with augmented LSF (12%) had reoperation. In\nnon-augmented LSF, patients with reoperation had significantly lower BMD than\npatients without reoperation (P = 0.005). The best cut-off to predict\nreoperation after non-augmented LSF was BMD < 83.7 mg/cc.

There is the potential to have melt generation\nalong the spokes, but at a rate which is relatively small compared with that at\nthe hubs. Such melting of spokes can only occur when the lithosphere is\nsufficiently thin ($\\lesssim 80$ km) and mantle water contents are sufficiently\nhigh ($\\gtrsim 100$ ppm). The distribution of volcanism across the Middle East,\nArabia and Africa north of equator suggests that it results from such spoke\npattern convection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2019 14:21:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 15:52:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 10:46:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-12"}

While the\nGCNs have been successfully applied to this problem, some caveats inherited\nfrom classical deep learning still remain as open research topics in the\ncontext of the node classification problem. One such inherited caveat is that\nGCNs only consider the nodes that are a few propagations away from the labeled\nnodes to classify them. However, taking only a few propagation steps away nodes\ninto account defeats the purpose of using the graph topological information in\nthe GCNs. To remedy this problem, the-state-of-the-art methods leverage the\nnetwork diffusion approaches, namely personalized page rank and its variants,\nto fully account for the graph topology, {\\em after} they use the Neural\nNetworks in the GCNs. However, these approaches overlook the fact that the\nnetwork diffusion methods favour high degree nodes in the graph, resulting in\nthe propagation of labels to unlabeled centralized, hub, nodes. To address this\nbiasing hub nodes problem, in this paper, we propose to utilize a\ndimensionality reduction technique conjugate with personalized page rank so\nthat we can both take advantage from graph topology and resolve the hub node\nfavouring problem for GCNs. Here, our approach opens a new holistic road for\nmessage passing phase of GCNs by suggesting the usage of other proximity\nmatrices instead of well-known Laplacian. Testing on two real-world networks\nthat are commonly used in benchmarking GCNs' performance for the node\nclassification context, we systematically evaluate the performance of the\nproposed methodology and show that our approach outperforms existing methods\nfor wide ranges of parameter values with very limited deep learning training\n{\\em epochs}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2019 14:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

The\npairwise (or bivariate) transfer entropy from a source to a target node in a\nnetwork does not depend solely on the local source-target link weight, but on\nthe wider network structure that the link is embedded in. This relationship is\nstudied using a discrete-time linearly-coupled Gaussian model, which allows us\nto derive the transfer entropy for each link from the network topology. It is\nshown analytically that the dependence on the directed link weight is only a\nfirst approximation, valid for weak coupling. More generally, the transfer\nentropy increases with the in-degree of the source and decreases with the\nin-degree of the target, indicating an asymmetry of information transfer\nbetween hubs and low-degree nodes. In addition, the transfer entropy is\ndirectly proportional to weighted motif counts involving common parents or\nmultiple walks from the source to the target, which are more abundant in\nnetworks with a high clustering coefficient than in random networks. Our\nfindings also apply to Granger causality, which is equivalent to transfer\nentropy for Gaussian variables.

It has been\nwidely reported that back-translation delivers superior results, but could this\nbe due to artefacts in the test sets? We perform a case study using\nFrench-English news translation task and separate test sets based on their\noriginal languages. We show that forward translation delivers superior gains in\nterms of BLEU on sentences that were originally in the source language,\ncomplementing previous studies which show large improvements with\nback-translation on sentences that were originally in the target language. To\nbetter understand when and why forward and back-translation are effective, we\nstudy the role of domains, translationese, and noise. While translationese\neffects are well known to influence MT evaluation, we also find evidence that\nnews data from different languages shows subtle domain differences, which is\nanother explanation for varying performance on different portions of the test\nset.

This research develops automatic clinical\nmonitoring techniques for PD, following treatment, using the novel application\nof EAs. Specifically, the research question addressed was: Can accurate\nmonitoring of PD be achieved using EAs on rs-fMRI data for patients prescribed\nModafinil (typically prescribed for PD patients to relieve physical fatigue)?\nMethods: This research develops novel clinical monitoring tools using data from\na controlled experiment where participants were administered Modafinil versus\nplacebo, examining the novel application of EAs to both map and predict the\nfunctional connectivity in participants using rs-fMRI data. Specifically, CGP\nwas used to classify DCM analysis and timeseries data. Results were validated\nwith two other commonly used classification methods (ANN and SVM) and via\nk-fold cross-validation. Results: Findings revealed a maximum accuracy of\n74.57% for CGP. Furthermore, CGP provided comparable performance accuracy\nrelative to ANN and SVM. Nevertheless, EAs enable us to decode the classifier,\nin terms of understanding the data inputs that are used, more easily than in\nANN and SVM. Conclusions: These findings underscore the applicability of both\nDCM analyses for classification and CGP as a novel classification technique for\nbrain imaging data with medical implications for medication monitoring.\nFurthermore, classification of fMRI data for research typically involves\nstatistical modelling techniques being often hypothesis driven, whereas EAs use\ndata-driven explanatory modelling methods resulting in numerous benefits.

To address this\nchallenge, a novel neural network structure called Capsule Network has been\nproposed, which introduces equivariance through capsules to significantly\nenhance the learning ability for image segmentation and object detection. Due\nto its requirement of performing a high volume of matrix operations, CapsNets\nhave been generally accelerated on modern GPU platforms that provide highly\noptimized software library for common deep learning tasks.

We employed\nchi-squared and maximum relevance and minimum redundancy (MRMR) feature\nselection techniques on the psycho-linguistic features obtained from the new\narticles etc. After extensive experimentation, using the Diebold-Mariano test,\nwe conclude that GMDH and GRNN are statistically the best techniques in that\norder with respect to the MAPE and NRMSE values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2019 11:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}

Over the past decade, however, researchers have\ndeveloped the influence diagram, a graphical representation of a decision\nmaker's beliefs, alternatives, and preferences that serves as the knowledge\nbase of a normative expert system. Most people who have seen the representation\nfind it intuitive and easy to use. Consequently, the influence diagram has\novercome significantly the barriers to constructing normative expert systems.\nNevertheless, building influence diagrams is not practical for extremely large\nand complex domains. In this book, I address the difficulties associated with\nthe construction of the probabilistic portion of an influence diagram, called a\nknowledge map, belief network, or Bayesian network. I introduce two\nrepresentations that facilitate the generation of large knowledge maps. In\nparticular, I introduce the similarity network, a tool for building the network\nstructure of a knowledge map, and the partition, a tool for assessing the\nprobabilities associated with a knowledge map. I then use these representations\nto build Pathfinder, a large normative expert system for the diagnosis of\nlymph-node diseases (the domain contains over 60 diseases and over 100 disease\nfindings). In an early version of the system, I encoded the knowledge of the\nexpert using an erroneous assumption that all disease findings were\nindependent, given each disease. When the expert and I attempted to build a\nmore accurate knowledge map for the domain that would capture the dependencies\namong the disease findings, we failed. Using a similarity network, however, we\nbuilt the knowledge-map structure for the entire domain in approximately 40\nhours. Furthermore, the partition representation reduced the number of\nprobability assessments required by the expert from 75,000 to 14,000.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 20:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}

We consider a deformed extension of dS spacetime by\nmeans of a single $\\mathbb Z_q$ quotient, which resembles an Orbifold geometry.\nThe Orbifold parameter induces a pair of codimension two minimal surfaces given\nby 2-spheres in the Euclidean geometry. Using dimensional reduction on the\ntwo-dimensional plane where the minimal surfaces have support, we use the\nLiouville field theory and the Kerr/CFT mechanism in order to describe the\nunderlying degrees of freedom of the Cosmological Horizon. We then show, that\nin the large $q$-limit, this pair of codimensions two surfaces can be realized\nas the conformal boundaries of dS$_3$. We notice that the central charge\nobtained using Liouville theory, in the latter limit, corresponds to the\nStrominger central charge obtained in the context of the dS/CFT correspondence.\nIn addition, a formulation of entanglement entropy for de Sitter spacetimes is\ngiven in terms of dS holography and also a different approach in which the\nentanglement between two disconnected bulk observers is described in terms of\nthe topology of the spacetime. Therefore, a quarter of the area formula is\nproposed, in which the area corresponds to the are of the set of fixed points\nof an $S^2/\\mathbb Z_q$ orbifold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 20:27:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 17:31:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 23:15:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

We introduce the concept of a\nsingle quantum system, the generating core of which is an abstract\n$C^\\ast$-algebra. It is shown that various concrete implementations of the\noperator algebra depend on the structure of generators of the fundamental\nsymmetry group attached to the energy operator. In the case of generators of\nthe complex shell of a group algebra of a conformal group, the spectrum of\nstates of a single quantum system is given in the framework of the basic\nrepresentation of the Rumer-Fet group, which leads to a group-theoretic\ninterpretation of the Mendeleev's periodic system of elements. A mass formula\nis introduced that allows to give the termwise mass splitting for the main\nmultiplet of the Rumer-Fet group. The masses of elements of the Seaborg table\n(eight-periodic extension of the Mendeleev table) are calculated starting from\nthe atomic number $Z=121$ to $Z=220$. The continuation of Seaborg homology\nbetween lanthanides and actinides is established to the group of\nsuperactinides. A 10-periodic extension of the periodic table is introduced in\nthe framework of the group-theoretic approach. The multiplet structure of the\nextended table periods is considered in detail. It is shown that the period\nlengths of the system of elements are determined by the structure of the basic\nrepresentation of the Rumer-Fet group. The theoretical masses of the elements\nof 10th and 11th periods are calculated starting from $Z=221$ to $Z=364$.
