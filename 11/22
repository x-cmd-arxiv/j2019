Thus, optimization of MRI methods requires a subjective choice\nabout what aspects of quality matter most in the context of a given MRI\nexperiment, and subsequently the subjective choice of an optimality metric that\nhopefully does a reasonable job of quantifying those aspects of quality. Once\nthese choices are made, the optimization problem becomes well-defined, and it\nremains to choose an algorithm that can identify data sampling or image\nreconstruction methods that are optimal with respect to the chosen metric.

Clear and unusual spectral variability is observed, but\nthis is markedly suppressed above $\\sim$10-15 keV, qualitatively similar to the\nULX Holmberg IX X-1. We model the multi-epoch data with two-component accretion\ndisc models designed to approximate super-Eddington accretion, allowing for\nboth a black hole and a neutron star accretor. With regards to the hotter disc\ncomponent, the data trace out two distinct tracks in the luminosity-temperature\nplane, with larger emitting radii and lower temperatures seen at higher\nobserved fluxes. Despite this apparent anti-correlation, each of these tracks\nindividually shows a positive luminosity-temperature relation. Both are broadly\nconsistent with $L\\propto{T}^{4}$, as expected for blackbody emission with a\nconstant area, and also with $L\\propto{T}^{2}$, as may be expected for an\nadvection-dominated disc around a black hole. We consider a variety of\npossibilities for this unusual behaviour. Scenarios in which the innermost flow\nis suddenly blocked from view by outer regions of the super-Eddington disc/wind\ncan explain the luminosity-temperature behaviour, but are difficult to\nreconcile with the lack of strong variability at higher energies, assuming this\nemission arises from the most compact regions. Instead, we may be seeing\nevidence for further radial stratification of the accretion flow than is\nincluded in the simple models considered, with a combination of winds and\nadvection resulting in the suppressed high-energy variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 17:30:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 11:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

Besides understanding the functionality provided by existing\nvisualization libraries, generating the desired visualization also requires\nreshaping and aggregating the underlying data as well as composing different\nvisual elements to achieve the intended visual narrative. This paper aims to\nsimplify visualization tasks by automatically synthesizing the required program\nfrom simple visual sketches provided by the user. Specifically, given an input\ndata set and a visual sketch that demonstrates how to visualize a very small\nsubset of this data, our technique automatically generates a program that can\nbe used to visualize the entire data set.\n  Automating visualization poses several challenges. First, because many\nvisualization tasks require data wrangling in addition to generating plots, we\nneed to decompose the end-to-end synthesis task into two separate sub-problems.\nSecond, because the intermediate specification that results from the\ndecomposition is necessarily imprecise, this makes the data wrangling task\nparticularly challenging in our context. In this paper, we address these\nproblems by developing a new compositional visualization-by-example technique\nthat (a) decomposes the end-to-end task into two different synthesis problems\nover different DSLs and (b) leverages bi-directional program analysis to deal\nwith the complexity that arises from having an imprecise intermediate\nspecification.\n  We implemented our visualization-by-example algorithm and evaluate it on 83\nvisualization tasks collected from on-line forums and tutorials.

Here we consider whether they could\nhave large inferred radii because they are in fact ringed. This would naturally\nexplain why super-puffs have thus far only shown featureless transit spectra.\nWe find that this hypothesis can work in some cases but not all. The close\nproximity of the super-puffs to their parent stars necessitates rings with a\nrocky rather than icy composition. This limits the radius of the rings, and\nmakes it challenging to explain the large size of Kepler 51b, 51c, 51d, and 79d\nunless the rings are composed of porous material. Furthermore, the short tidal\nlocking timescales for Kepler 18d, 223d, and 223e mean that these planets may\nbe spinning too slowly, resulting in a small oblateness and rings that are\nwarped by their parent star. Kepler 87c and 177c have the best chance of being\nexplained by rings.

Knowing the local distortion of the Galactic magnetic field associated\nwith the LB is critical for the modeling of interstellar polarization data at\nhigh Galactic latitudes. In this his paper, we relate the structure of the\nGalactic magnetic field on the LB scale to three-dimensional (3D) maps of the\nlocal interstellar medium (ISM). First, we extracted the geometry of the LB\nshell, its inner surface, in particular from 3D dust extinction maps of the\nlocal ISM. We expanded the shell inner surface in spherical harmonics, up to a\nvariable maximum multipole degree, which enabled us to control the level of\ncomplexity for the modeled surface.

The notorious Wigner's friend gedankenexperiment\nconstitutes the paradoxical scenario in which different observers (one of whom\nis observed by the other) describe one and the same interaction differently,\none --the Friend-- via state-update and the other --Wigner-- unitarily. This\ncan lead to Wigner and his friend assigning different probabilities to the\noutcome of the same subsequent measurement. In this paper, we apply the\nPage-Wootters mechanism (PWM) as a timeless description of Wigner's friend-like\nscenarios. We show that the standard rules to assign two-time conditional\nprobabilities within the PWM need to be modified to deal with the Wigner's\nfriend gedankenexperiment. We identify three main definitions of such modified\nrules to assign two-time conditional probabilities, all of which reduce to\nstandard quantum theory for non-Wigner's friend scenarios. However, when\napplied to the Wigner's friend setup each rule assigns different conditional\nprobabilities, potentially resolving the probability-assignment paradox in a\ndifferent manner. Moreover, one rule imposes strict limits on when a joint\nprobability distribution for the measurement outcomes of Wigner and his Friend\nis well-defined, which single out those cases where Wigner's measurement does\nnot disturb the Friend's memory and such a probability has an operational\nmeaning in terms of collectible statistics. Interestingly, the same limits\nguarantee that said measurement outcomes fulfill the consistency condition of\nthe consistent histories framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 19:01:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 16:08:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 Aug 2021 13:37:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 17:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

We report unique observations with the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)\nand the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) that link the captured thermal\nproperties across the extreme spatiotemporal scales covered by TNE processes.\nWithin the same coronal loop bundle, we captured 6 hr period coronal intensity\npulsations in SDO/AIA and coronal rain observed off-limb in the chromospheric\nHalpha and Ca II K spectral lines with SST/CRISP and SST/CHROMIS. We combined a\nmulti-thermal analysis of the cycles with AIA and an extensive spectral\ncharacterisation of the rain clumps with the SST. We find clear evidence of\nevaporation-condensation cycles in the corona which are linked with periodic\ncoronal rain showers. The high-resolution spectroscopic instruments at the SST\nreveal the fine-structured rain strands and allow us to probe the cooling phase\nof one of the cycles down to chromospheric temperatures. These observations\nreinforce the link between long-period intensity pulsations and coronal rain.\nThey also demonstrate the capability of TNE to shape the dynamics of active\nregions on the large scales as well as on the smallest scales currently\nresolvable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 19:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-25"}

The DM\nself-heating is efficient towards the halo center, and the heat injection is\nused to enhance the formation of a uniform density core inside halos. The\neffect of DM self-heating is expected to be more significant in smaller halos\nfor two reasons: 1) the exothermic cross section times the relative velocity,\n$\\left\\langle\\sigma_{\\rm exo}v_{\\rm rel}\\right\\rangle$, is constant; 2) and the\nratio of the injected heat to the velocity dispersion squared gets larger\ntowards smaller halos.

The\npaper emerged from a study to define specifications for a knowledge-based\ninfrastructure to provide decision support for community-level MSPs in the\nCanadian province of Quebec. As part of the study, a process assessment was\nconducted to understand the needs of communities as they collect, organize, and\nanalyze data to make decisions about their priorities. The result of this\nprocess is a portrait, which is an epidemiological profile of health and\nnutrition in their community. Portraits inform strategic planning and\ndevelopment of interventions and are used to assess the impact of\ninterventions. Our key findings indicate ambiguities and disagreement among MSP\ndecision-makers regarding causal relationships between actions and outcomes,\nand the relevant data needed for making decisions. MSP decision-makers\nexpressed a desire for easy-to-use tools that facilitate the collection,\norganization, synthesis, and analysis of data, to enable decision-making in a\ntimely manner. Findings inform conceptual modeling and ontological analysis to\ncapture the domain knowledge and specify relationships between actions and\noutcomes. This modeling and analysis provide the foundation for an ontology,\nencoded using OWL 2 Web Ontology Language. The ontology is developed to provide\nsemantic support for the MSP process, defining objectives, strategies, actions,\nindicators, and data sources. In the future, software interacting with the\nontology can facilitate interactive browsing by decision-makers in the MSP in\nthe form of concepts, instances, relationships, and axioms. Our ontology also\nfacilitates the integration and interpretation of community data and can help\nin managing semantic interoperability between different knowledge sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 21:42:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-25"}

A methodology is proposed in\nseveral five steps: first, it is proposed to use the multimodality test to\ndecide the number of subpopulations to be considered in the model, second to\nadjust simple parametric survival models and mixture distribution models, to\nestimate the parameters and to select the best model fitted the data, finally,\nto test the hypotheses to compare the effectiveness of immunotherapies in the\ncontext of randomized clinical trials. The methodology is illustrated with data\nfrom a clinical trial that evaluates the effectiveness of the therapeutic\nvaccine CIMAvaxEGF vs the best supportive care for the treatment of advanced\nlung cancer.

In the stationary, one-dimensional (1D) supernova \"bulb\nmodel\", this self-induced refraction can lead to a collective flavor\ntransformation which is coherent among different neutrino momentum modes. Such\ncollective oscillations can produce partial swaps of the energy spectra of\ndifferent neutrino species as the neutrinos stream away from the proto-neutron\nstar. However, it has been demonstrated that the spatial symmetries (such as\nthe spherical symmetry in the bulb model) can be broken spontaneously by\ncollective neutrino oscillations in multi-dimensional models. Using a\nstationary, 2D neutrino ring model we demonstrate that there exist two limiting\nscenarios where collective oscillations may occur. In one limit, the collective\nflavor transformation begins at a radius with relatively high neutrino\ndensities and develops small-scale flavor structures. The loss of the spatial\ncorrelation in the neutrino flavor field results in similar (average) energy\nspectra for the anti-neutrinos of almost all energies and the neutrinos of\nrelatively high energies. In the other limit, the flavor transformation starts\nat a radius where the neutrino densities are smaller (e.g., due to the\nsuppression of the high matter density near the proto-neutron star). Although\nthe spatial symmetry is broken initially, it is restored as the neutrino\ndensities decrease, and the neutrinos of different flavors partially swap their\nenergy spectra as in the 1D bulb model. This finding may have interesting\nramifications in other aspects of supernova physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 22:29:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2020 20:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-17"}

Previous deep network structures often focused on macro-motion\nwhich extends over long time scales, e.g., on the order of seconds. We believe\nintegrating structures capturing information about both micro- and macro-motion\nwill benefit emotion prediction, because human perceive both micro- and\nmacro-expressions. In this paper, we propose to combine micro- and macro-motion\nfeatures to improve video emotion recognition with a two-stream recurrent\nnetwork, named MIMAMO (Micro-Macro-Motion) Net. Specifically, smaller and\nshorter micro-motions are analyzed by a two-stream network, while larger and\nmore sustained macro-motions can be well captured by a subsequent recurrent\nnetwork. Assigning specific interpretations to the roles of different parts of\nthe network enables us to make choice of parameters based on prior knowledge:\nchoices that turn out to be optimal. One of the important innovations in our\nmodel is the use of interframe phase differences rather than optical flow as\ninput to the temporal stream. Compared with the optical flow, phase differences\nrequire less computation and are more robust to illumination changes. Our\nproposed network achieves state of the art performance on two video emotion\ndatasets, the OMG emotion dataset and the Aff-Wild dataset. The most\nsignificant gains are for arousal prediction, for which motion information is\nintuitively more informative.

Existing approaches usually consider that the\nnoisy sentences are useless and will harm the model's performance. Therefore,\nthey mainly alleviate this problem by reducing the influence of noisy\nsentences, such as applying bag-level selective attention or removing noisy\nsentences from sentence-bags. However, the underlying cause of the noisy\nlabeling problem is not the lack of useful information, but the missing\nrelation labels. Intuitively, if we can allocate credible labels for noisy\nsentences, they will be transformed into useful training data and benefit the\nmodel's performance. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel method for distant\nsupervised relation extraction, which employs unsupervised deep clustering to\ngenerate reliable labels for noisy sentences. Specifically, our model contains\nthree modules: a sentence encoder, a noise detector and a label generator. The\nsentence encoder is used to obtain feature representations.

Despite their empirical success, existing listwise methods are based on\nheuristics and remain theoretically ill-understood. In particular, none of the\nempirically successful loss functions are related to ranking metrics. In this\nwork, we propose a cross entropy-based learning-to-rank loss function that is\ntheoretically sound, is a convex bound on NDCG -- a popular ranking metric --\nand is consistent with NDCG under learning scenarios common in information\nretrieval.

While the solvent is often depicted as a\nsource of barrier in the ligand recognition process by polar cavity, the nature\nof solvent's role in the recognition process involving hydrophobic cavity and\nhydrophobic ligand remains to be addressed. In this work, we quantitatively\nassess the role of solvent in dictating the kinetic process of recognition in a\npopular system involving hydrophobic cavity and ligand. In this prototypical\nsystem the hydrophobic cavity undergoes \\textit{dewetting transition} as the\nligand approaches the cavity, which influences the cavity-ligand recognition\nkinetics. Here, we build Markov state model (MSM) using adaptively sampled\nunrestrained molecular dynamics simulation trajectories to map the kinetic\nrecognition process. The MSM-reconstructed free energy surface recovers a broad\nwater distribution at an intermediate cavity-ligand separation, consistent with\nprevious report of dewetting transition in this system. Time-structured\nindependent component analysis of the simulated trajectories quantitatively\nshows that cavity-solvent density contributes considerably in an optimised\nreaction coordinate involving cavity-ligand separation and water occupancy. Our\napproach quantifies two solvent-mediated macro states at an intermediate\nseparation of the cavity-ligand recognition pathways, apart from the fully\nligand-bound and fully ligand-unbound macro states. Interestingly, we find that\nthese water-mediated intermediates, while transient in populations, can undergo\nslow mutual interconversion and create possibilities of multiple pathways of\ncavity recognition by the ligand.

This paper proposes a framework that enables a fast\ncascading path searching under high penetration of wind power. In addition, we\nease the computational burden by formulating the cascading path searching\nproblem into a Markov chain searching problem and further use a\ndictionary-based technique to accelerate the calculations. In detail, we first\ngenerate massive wind generation and load scenarios. Then, we utilize the\nMarkov search strategy to decouple the problem into a large number of DC power\nflow (DCPF) and DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) problems. The major\ntime-consuming part, the DCOPF and the DCPF problems, is accelerated by the\ndynamic construction of a line status dictionary (LSD). The information in the\nLSD can significantly ease the computation burden of the following DCPF and\nDCOPF problems. The proposed method is proven to be effective by a case study\nof the IEEE RTS-79 test system and an empirical study of China's Henan Province\npower system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 04:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-25"}

Archipelago views each application as a\nDAG of functions, and every DAG in associated with a latency deadline.\nArchipelago achieves its per-DAG request latency goals by: (1) partitioning a\ngiven cluster into a number of smaller worker pools, and associating each pool\nwith a semi-global scheduler (SGS), (2) using a latency-aware scheduler within\neach SGS along with proactive sandbox allocation to reduce overheads, and (3)\nusing a load balancing layer to route requests for different DAGs to the\nappropriate SGS, and automatically scale the number of SGSs per DAG. Our\ntestbed results show that Archipelago meets the latency deadline for more than\n99% of realistic application request workloads, and reduces tail latencies by\nup to 36X compared to state-of-the-art serverless platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 04:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-25"}

There may be multiple\nrelation tuples present in a text and they may share one or both entities among\nthem. Extracting such relation tuples from a sentence is a difficult task and\nsharing of entities or overlapping entities among the tuples makes it more\nchallenging. Most prior work adopted a pipeline approach where entities were\nidentified first followed by finding the relations among them, thus missing the\ninteraction among the relation tuples in a sentence.

Neural architecture search\n(NAS) has shown great potential in finding an optimal solution. Existing NAS\nworks for object detection only focus on searching better design of a single\nmodule such as backbone or feature fusion neck, while neglecting the balance of\nthe whole system. In this paper, we present a two-stage coarse-to-fine\nsearching strategy named Structural-to-Modular NAS (SM-NAS) for searching a\nGPU-friendly design of both an efficient combination of modules and better\nmodular-level architecture for object detection. Specifically, Structural-level\nsearching stage first aims to find an efficient combination of different\nmodules; Modular-level searching stage then evolves each specific module and\npushes the Pareto front forward to a faster task-specific network.

Among such models, the linear-linear piecewise change pattern\nis the most straightforward one. An earlier study has proved that other than\nthe intercept and slopes, the knot (or change-point), at which two linear\nsegments join together, can be estimated as a growth factor in a\nreparameterized longitudinal model in the latent growth curve modeling\nframework. However, the reparameterized coefficients were no longer directly\nrelated to the underlying developmental process and therefore lacked\nmeaningful, substantive interpretation, although they were simple functions of\nthe original parameters. This study proposes transformation matrices between\nparameters in the original and reparameterized models so that the interpretable\ncoefficients directly related to the underlying change pattern can be derived\nfrom reparameterized ones. Additionally, the study extends the existing\nlinear-linear piecewise model to allow for individual measurement occasions,\nand investigates predictors for the individual-differences in change patterns.\nWe present the proposed methods with simulation studies and a real-world data\nanalysis. Our simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method can\ngenerally provide an unbiased and consistent estimation of model parameters of\ninterest and confidence intervals with satisfactory coverage probabilities. An\nempirical example using longitudinal mathematics achievement scores shows that\nthe model can estimate the growth factor coefficients and path coefficients\ndirectly related to the underlying developmental process, thereby providing\nmeaningful interpretation.

For example, given a\nface image dataset (e.g., CelebA) with multiple discrete fine-grained labels,\nwe can learn to smoothly interpolate a face image between black hair and blond\nhair through reference images while immediately controlling the gender and age\nthrough discrete input labels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nwork that realizes such a hybrid manipulation within a single model.

Historically, it has been studied by linear\nstability analyses at infinite Reynolds number, $Re$, and by direct numerical\nsimulations at relatively low $Re$ in the regions known to be unstable from the\ninviscid linear stability results. In this paper, we perform linear stability\nanalyses of the classical `Hazel model' of a stratified shear layer (where the\nbackground velocity and density distributions are assumed to take the\nfunctional form of hyperbolic tangents with different characteristic vertical\nscales) over a range of different parameters at finite $Re$, finding new\nunstable regions of parameter space. In particular, we find instability when\nthe Richardson number is everywhere greater than $1/4$, where the flow would be\nstable at infinite $Re$ by the Miles-Howard theorem. We find unstable modes\nwith no critical layer, and show that despite the necessity of viscosity for\nthe new instability, the growth rate relative to diffusion of the background\nprofile is maximised at large $Re$. We use these results to shed new light on\nthe wave-resonance and over-reflection interpretations of stratified shear\ninstability. We argue for a definition of Holmboe instability as being\ncharacterised by propagating vortices above or below the shear layer, as\nopposed to any reference to sharp density interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 10:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Unfortunately, a\ncompetitive equilibrium may not exist when the goods are indivisible, even in\nextremely simple markets such as two agents with exactly the same budget and a\nsingle item. Yet in this example, once the budgets are slightly\nperturbed---i.e., made generic---a competitive equilibrium is guaranteed to\nexist. In this paper we explore the extent to which generic budgets can\nguarantee equilibrium existence (and thus related fairness guarantees) in\nmarkets with multiple items. We complement our results in [Babaioff et al.,\n2019] for additive preferences by exploring the case of general monotone\npreferences, establishing positive results for small numbers of items and\nmapping the limits of our approach. We then consider cardinal preferences,\ndefine a hierarchy of such preference classes and establish relations among\nthem, and for some classes prove equilibrium existence under generic budgets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 12:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-25"}

One\neffective way to improve the service evaluation is to hire fake rating\nproviders by bribery. The fake ratings given by the bribed buyers influence the\nevaluation of the service, which further impacts the decision-making of\npotential buyers. In this paper, we study the bribery of a rating system with\nmultiple sellers and buyers via a game-theoretic perspective.

So far, most sound zone control methods rely on either an\noptimization of physical metrics such as acoustic contrast and signal\ndistortion or a mode decomposition of the desired sound field. By using these\ntypes of methods, approximately 15 dB of acoustic contrast between the\nreproduced sound field in the target zone and its leakage to other zone(s) has\nbeen reported in practical set-ups, but this is typically not high enough to\nsatisfy the people inside the zones. In this paper, we propose a sound zone\ncontrol method shaping the leakage errors so that they are as inaudible as\npossible for a given acoustic contrast. The shaping of the leakage errors is\nperformed by taking the time-varying input signal characteristics and the human\nauditory system into account when the loudspeaker control filters are\ncalculated. We show how this shaping can be performed using variable span\ntrade-off filters, and we show theoretically how these filters can be used for\ntrading signal distortion in the target zone for acoustic contrast. The\nproposed method is evaluated based on physical metrics such as acoustic\ncontrast and perceptual metrics such as STOI. The computational complexity and\nprocessing time of the proposed method for different system set-ups are also\ninvestigated. Lastly, the results of a MUSHRA listening test are reported. The\ntest results show that the proposed method provides more than 20% perceptual\nimprovement compared to existing sound zone control methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 13:04:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 11:17:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 11:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

On the level of multipartite\nsystems, this gives rise to what is known as monogamy of entanglement. On the\nlevel of single systems this leads to a bound, and hence, a trade-off in\ncoherence that can exist between different orthogonal subspaces. In this work\nwe derive trade-off relations for the amount of coherence that can be shared\nbetween a given subspace and all other subspaces based on trace norm,\nHilbert-Schmidt norm and von Neumann relative entropy.

Preliminary\nwork in this regard has been done by the X-ray satellite XPNAV. NICER with its\nfar superior sensitivity is expected to reveal much more detailed behavior.\nmethods: NICER has accumulated more than $301$ kilo seconds of data on the Crab\npulsar, equivalent to more than $3.3$ billion soft X-ray photons. These data\nwere first processed using the standard NICER analysis pipeline. Then the\narrival times of the X-ray photons were referred to the solar system's\nbarycenter. Then specific analysis was done to study the specific behavior\noutlined in the following sections, while taking dead time into account.\nresults: The variation of the rotation frequency of the Crab pulsar and its\ntime derivative during the glitch is almost exactly similar at the radio and\nX-ray energies. The following properties of the Crab pulsar remain essentially\nconstant before and after the glitch: the total X-ray flux; the flux, widths,\nand peaks of the two components of its integrated profile; and the soft X-ray\nspectrum. There is no evidence for giant pulses at X-ray energies. However, the\ntiming noise of the Crab pulsar shows quasi sinusoidal variation before the\nglitch, with increasing amplitude, which is absent after the glitch.\nconclusions: Even the strongest glitch in the Crab pulsar appears not to affect\nall but one of the properties mentioned above, at either frequency. The fact\nthat the timing noise appears to change due to the glitch is an important clue\nto unravel as this is still an unexplained phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 13:20:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

Ballot-polling is particularly simple; two new ballot-polling\nrisk-measuring functions for sampling without replacement are given.\nBallot-level comparison audits transform each null into an equivalent assertion\nthat the mean of re-scaled tabulation errors is not greater than 1/2. In turn,\nthat null can then be tested using the same statistical methods used for ballot\npolling---but applied to different finite lists of nonnegative numbers.\nSHANGRLA comparison audits are more efficient than previous comparison audits\nfor two reasons: (i) for most social choice functions, the conditions tested\nare both necessary and sufficient for the reported outcome to be correct, while\nprevious methods tested conditions that were sufficient but not necessary, and\n(ii) the tests avoid a conservative approximation.

The cost of said step is that of inverting one Hessian and\nit guarantees, under some conditions, that the iterate remains in the quadratic\nconvergence region of the optimization problem at the next time step.

Their\noptical functionality is not determined by the properties of the base\nmaterials, but rather by tailored, multiscale structures, in terms of precise\npore shape, geometry, and orientation. Embedding liquid crystals in pore space\nprovides additional opportunities to control light-matter interactions at the\nsingle-pore, meta-atomic scale. Here, we present temperature-dependent 3D\nreciprocal space mapping using synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction in\ncombination with high-resolution birefringence experiments on disk-like\nmesogens (HAT6) imbibed in self-ordered arrays of parallel cylindrical pores 17\nto 160 nm across in monolithic anodic aluminium oxide (AAO). In agreement with\nMonte Carlo computer simulations we observe a remarkably rich self-assembly\nbehaviour, unknown from the bulk state. It encompasses transitions between the\nisotropic liquid state and discotic stacking in linear columns as well as\ncircular concentric ring formation perpendicular and parallel to the pore axis.\nThese textural transitions underpin an optical birefringence functionality,\ntuneable in magnitude and in sign from positive to negative via pore size, pore\nsurface-grafting and temperature. Our study demonstrates that the advent of\nlarge-scale, self-organised nanoporosity in monolithic solids along with\nconfinement-controllable phase behaviour of liquid-crystalline matter at the\nsingle-pore scale provides a reliable and accessible tool to design materials\nwith adjustable optical anisotropy, and thus offers versatile pathways to\nfine-tune polarisation-dependent light propagation speeds in materials. Such a\ntailorability is at the core of the emerging field of transformative optics,\nallowing, e.g., adjustable light absorbers and extremely thin metalenses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 14:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

The\nscores are generated by a function (mechanism) that takes a set of features as\ninput and generates a score.The scoring functions are either machine-learned or\nhuman-designed and can be used for different decision purposes such as ranking\nor classification.\n  Given the potential impact of these scoring mechanisms on individuals' lives\nand on society, it is important to make sure these scores are computed\nresponsibly. Hence we need tools for responsible scoring mechanism design. In\nthis paper, focusing on linear scoring functions, we highlight the importance\nof unbiased function sampling and perturbation in the function space for\ndevising such tools. We provide unbiased samplers for the entire function\nspace, as well as a $\\theta$-vicinity around a given function.\n  We then illustrate the value of these samplers for designing effective\nalgorithms in three diverse problem scenarios in the context of ranking.\nFinally, as a fundamental method for designing responsible scoring mechanisms,\nwe propose a novel approach for approximating the construction of the\narrangement of hyperplanes. Despite the exponential complexity of an\narrangement in the number of dimensions, using function sampling, our algorithm\nis linear in the number of samples and hyperplanes, and independent of the\nnumber of dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 15:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-25"}

Conversely, we propose DWARF, a novel and lightweight\narchitecture able to infer full scene flow jointly reasoning about depth and\noptical flow easily and elegantly trainable end-to-end from scratch. Moreover,\nsince ground truth images for full scene flow are scarce, we propose to\nleverage on the knowledge learned by networks specialized in stereo or flow,\nfor which much more data are available, to distill proxy annotations.\nExhaustive experiments show that i) DWARF runs at about 10 FPS on a single\nhigh-end GPU and about 1 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX2 embedded at KITTI resolution,\nwith moderate drop in accuracy compared to 10x deeper models, ii) learning from\nmany distilled samples is more effective than from the few, annotated ones\navailable.

Recently, Smart Predict and Optimize (SPO) has\nbeen proposed for problems with a linear objective function over the\npredictions, more specifically linear programming problems. It takes the regret\nof the predictions on the linear problem into account, by repeatedly solving it\nduring learning. We investigate the use of SPO to solve more realistic discrete\noptimization problems. The main challenge is the repeated solving of the\noptimization problem. To this end, we investigate ways to relax the problem as\nwell as warmstarting the learning and the solving.

In this work, we propose a bi-level game-theoretic framework called\nFlipIn to design incentive-compatible and welfare-maximizing cyber insurance\ncontracts. The framework captures the strategic interactions among APT\nattackers, IoT defenders, and cyber insurance insurers, and incorporates\ninfluence networks to assess the systemic cyber risks of interconnected IoT\ndevices.

Indeed, many remarkable properties of string theory have been explained\nusing supersymmetry as a tool. In this dissertation, we review the basic\nformulation of supersymmetric quantum mechanics starting with introducing the\nconcepts of supercharges and superalgebra. We show that, if there is a\nsupersymmetric state, it is the zero-energy ground state. If such a state\nexists, the supersymmetry is unbroken otherwise it is broken. So far, there has\nbeen no unbroken supersymmetry observed in nature, and if nature is described\nby supersymmetry, it must be broken. In fact, supersymmetry may be broken\nspontaneously at any order of perturbation theory, or dynamically due to\nnon-perturbative effects. The goal of this dissertation is to study the methods\nof supersymmetry breaking. For this purpose, special attention is given to\ndiscuss the normalization of the ground state of the supersymmetric harmonic\noscillator. Then we explain that perturbation theory gives us incorrect results\nfor both the ground state wave function as well as the energy spectrum and it\nfails to give an explanation to the supersymmetry breaking. Later in the\ndissertation, a review of the uses of instantons in quantum mechanics is given.\nIn particular, instantons are used to compute the tunneling effects within the\npath integral approach to quantum mechanics. As a result, we give evidence that\nthe instantons, which are a non-perturbative effect in quantum mechanics and\ncan not be seen in perturbation theory, leads to calculate the corrections to\nthe ground state energy and provides a possible explanation for the\nsupersymmetry breaking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 14:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

Here, we introduce\na method of solar-driven water harvesting from soils, which can provide cheap\nfresh water in impoverished, arid and decentralized areas. The concentrated\nsolar energy is used to heat the soils to evaporate the soil moisture.

In the laboratory condition, an experimental setup\nis designed and its water-harvesting ability from soils is investigated. The\nmaximum water mass harvesting rate was 99.8 g h-1. In about 12 h, the total\nharvesting water could be as high as about 900 ml. The whole process is\nsolar-driven and spontaneous without other mechanical or electrical\nancillaries.

In addition, in\ndifferent MIMO structures (different combiners and the different number of\ntransceiver apertures), the proposed structure still achieve the performance of\nthe state of the art conventional system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 11:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-30"}

These new paradigms force us to leave aside our elder mechanistic\napproaches and embrace new starting points based on stochasticity, chaoticity,\nstatistics and probability. In this work we review the fundamental ideas of\ncomplexity theory and the classic probabilistic models to study complex\nsystems, based on the law of large numbers, central limit theorems and stable\ndistributions. We also talk about power laws as the most common model for\nphenomena showing long tail distributions and we explore the principal\ndifficulties that arise in practice with this kind of models. We show a novel\nalternative for the descripition of this type of phenomena and lastly we show\ntwo examples that illustrate the applications of this new model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 19:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-24"}
