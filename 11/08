We\nfound that in some regions of parameter space, DM would be difficult to observe\nin direct detection experiments while it would be easier to observe in indirect\ndetection experiments while for other regions of parameter space the situation\nwas reversed. Thus, measurements from both types of experiments complement each\nother and could help pinpoint the details of the hidden SU(3) model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 01:56:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

In particular, deep learning approaches have been\nsuccessfully applied for automated and assisted disease diagnosis and prognosis\nbased on complex and high-dimensional data. However, despite all justified\nenthusiasm, overoptimistic assessments of predictive performance are still\ncommon. Automated medical testing devices based on machine-learned prediction\nmodels should thus undergo a throughout evaluation before being implemented\ninto clinical practice. In this work, we propose a multiple testing framework\nfor (comparative) phase III diagnostic accuracy studies with sensitivity and\nspecificity as co-primary endpoints. Our approach challenges the frequent\nrecommendation to strictly separate model selection and evaluation, i.e. to\nonly assess a single diagnostic model in the evaluation study. We show that our\nparametric simultaneous test procedure asymptotically allows strong control of\nthe family-wise error rate. Moreover, we demonstrate in extensive simulation\nstudies that our multiple testing strategy on average leads to a better final\ndiagnostic model and increased statistical power. To plan such studies, we\npropose a Bayesian approach to determine the optimal number of models to\nevaluate. For this purpose, our algorithm optimizes the expected final model\nperformance given previous (hold-out) data from the model development phase. We\nconclude that an assessment of multiple promising diagnostic models in the same\nevaluation study has several advantages when suitable adjustments for multiple\ncomparisons are implemented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 01:58:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2020 22:38:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

Scaling the background N2\natmospheric pressure with the radius of the planet, we find that the inner edge\nof the HZ moves inwards towards the star for 5ME compared to 0.1ME planets for\nall spectral types. This is because the water-vapor column depth is smaller for\nlarger planets and higher temperatures are needed before water vapor completely\ndominates the outgoing longwave radiation. The outer edge of the HZ changes\nlittle due to competing effects of the albedo and greenhouse effect.

In each round, it commissions an\ninfluencer to promote the product over a social network, and then observes the\nsubsequent diffusion of the product before adaptively choosing the next\ninfluencer to commission. This process terminates when the budget is exhausted.\nWe assume that the diffusion process follows the popular Independent Cascade\nmodel. We also consider an online learning setting, where the brand initially\ndoes not know the diffusion parameters associated with the model, and has to\ngradually learn the parameters over time.\n  Unlike in existing models, the rounds in our model are correlated through an\nintermediary constraint: each user can be commissioned for an unlimited number\nof times. However, each user will spread influence without commission at most\nonce. Due to this added constraint, the order in which the influencers are\nchosen can change the influence spread, making obsolete existing analysis\ntechniques that based on the notion of adaptive submodularity. We devise a\nsample path analysis to prove that a greedy policy that knows the diffusion\nparameters achieves at least $1-1/e - \\epsilon$ times the expected reward of\nthe optimal policy.\n  In the online-learning setting, we are the first to consider a truly adaptive\ndecision making framework, rather than assuming independent epochs, and\nadaptivity only within epochs. Under mild assumptions, we derive a regret bound\nfor our algorithm. In our numerical experiments, we simulate information\ndiffusions on four Twitter sub-networks, and compare our UCB-based learning\nalgorithms with several baseline adaptive seeding strategies. Our learning\nalgorithm consistently outperforms the baselines and achieves rewards close to\nthe greedy policy that knows the true diffusion parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 02:09:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

As required for accurate simulations of the instrument, we have\nbuilt a comprehensive mass model of the instrument and developed a detailed\ndetector effects engine which applies the intrinsic detector performance to\nMonte Carlo simulations. The simulated detector effects include energy,\nposition, and timing resolution, thresholds, dead strips, charge sharing,\ncharge loss, crosstalk, dead time, and detector trigger conditions. After\nincluding these effects, the simulations closely resemble the measurements, the\nstandard analysis pipeline used for measurements can also be applied to the\nsimulations, and the responses computed from the simulations are accurate. We\nhave computed the systematic error that we must apply to measured fluxes at\ncertain energies, which is 6.3% on average. Here we describe the detector\neffects engine and the benchmarking tests performed with calibrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 02:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

SVM training is expensive especially for large and high\ndimensional datasets. The bottleneck of the SVM training often lies in the\nkernel value computation. In many real-world problems, the same kernel values\nare used in many iterations during the training, which makes the caching of\nkernel values potentially useful. The majority of the existing studies simply\nadopt the LRU (least recently used) replacement strategy for caching kernel\nvalues. However, as we analyze in this paper, the LRU strategy generally\nachieves high hit ratio near the final stage of the training, but does not work\nwell in the whole training process. Therefore, we propose a new caching\nstrategy called EFU (less frequently used) which replaces the less frequently\nused kernel values that enhances LFU (least frequently used). Our experimental\nresults show that EFU often has 20\\% higher hit ratio than LRU in the training\nwith the Gaussian kernel. To further optimize the strategy, we propose a\ncaching strategy called HCST (hybrid caching for the SVM training), which has a\nnovel mechanism to automatically adapt the better caching strategy in the\ndifferent stages of the training. We have integrated the caching strategy into\nThunderSVM, a recent SVM library on many-core processors. Our experiments show\nthat HCST adaptively achieves high hit ratios with little runtime overhead\namong different problems including multi-label classification, multiclass\nclassification and regression problems. Compared with other existing caching\nstrategies, HCST achieves 20\\% more reduction in training time on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 03:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

The multivariate\nt distribution is an example of such mixture, where W has an inverse-gamma\ndistribution. Algorithms to compute the joint distribution function and perform\nparameter estimation for the multivariate normal and t (with integer degrees of\nfreedom) can be found in the literature and are implemented in, e.g., the R\npackage mvtnorm. In this paper, efficient algorithms to perform these tasks in\nthe general case of a normal variance mixture are proposed. In addition to the\nabove two tasks, the evaluation of the joint (logarithmic) density function of\na general normal variance mixture is tackled as well, as it is needed for\nparameter estimation and does not always exist in closed form in this more\ngeneral setup. For the evaluation of the joint distribution function, the\nproposed algorithms apply randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) methods in a way\nthat improves upon existing methods proposed for the multivariate normal and t\ndistributions. An adaptive RQMC algorithm that similarly exploits the superior\nconvergence properties of RQMC methods is presented for the task of evaluating\nthe joint log-density function. This allows the parameter estimation task to be\naccomplished via an EM-like algorithm where all weights and log-densities are\nnumerically estimated.

The\n\\textsc{$k$-Path Vertex Cover Reconfiguration ($k$-PVCR)} problem asks if one\ncan transform one $k$-path vertex cover into another via a sequence of $k$-path\nvertex covers where each intermediate member is obtained from its predecessor\nby applying a given reconfiguration rule exactly once. We investigate the\ncomputational complexity of \\textsc{$k$-PVCR} from the viewpoint of graph\nclasses under the well-known reconfiguration rules: $\\mathsf{TS}$,\n$\\mathsf{TJ}$, and $\\mathsf{TAR}$. The problem for $k=2$, known as the\n\\textsc{Vertex Cover Reconfiguration (VCR)} problem, has been well-studied in\nthe literature. We show that certain known hardness results for \\textsc{VCR} on\ndifferent graph classes including planar graphs, bounded bandwidth graphs,\nchordal graphs, and bipartite graphs, can be extended for \\textsc{$k$-PVCR}. In\nparticular, we prove a complexity dichotomy for \\textsc{$k$-PVCR} on general\ngraphs: on those whose maximum degree is $3$ (and even planar), the problem is\n$\\mathtt{PSPACE}$-complete, while on those whose maximum degree is $2$ (i.e.,\npaths and cycles), the problem can be solved in polynomial time. Additionally,\nwe also design polynomial-time algorithms for \\textsc{$k$-PVCR} on trees under\neach of $\\mathsf{TJ}$ and $\\mathsf{TAR}$. Moreover, on paths, cycles, and\ntrees, we describe how one can construct a reconfiguration sequence between two\ngiven $k$-path vertex covers in a yes-instance. In particular, on paths, our\nconstructed reconfiguration sequence is shortest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 03:49:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 16:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-11"}

Recently, there has been the\ndevelopment of compact suffix trees in space proportional to \"$r$\", the number\nof runs in the BWT, as well as the appearance of $r$ in the time complexity of\nnew algorithms.

The migration of virtual\nresources across physical resources is another challenge that requires\nconsiderable attention; especially in federated cloud computing environments\nwherein, providers might be willing to offer their unused resources as a\nservice to the federation (cooperative allocation) and pull back these\nresources for their own use when they are needed (competitive allocation).

To\nour best knowledge, there is no existing method that can assess the\ngoodness-of-fit of a general classification procedure. Indeed, the lack of a\nparametric assumption makes it challenging to construct proper tests. To\novercome this difficulty, we propose a methodology called BAGofT that splits\nthe data into a training set and a validation set. First, the classification\nprocedure to assess is applied to the training set, which is also used to\nadaptively find a data grouping that reveals the most severe regions of\nunderfitting. Then, based on this grouping, we calculate a test statistic by\ncomparing the estimated success probabilities and the actual observed responses\nfrom the validation set. The data splitting guarantees that the size of the\ntest is controlled under the null hypothesis, and the power of the test goes to\none as the sample size increases under the alternative hypothesis. For testing\nparametric classification models, the BAGofT has a broader scope than the\nexisting methods since it is not restricted to specific parametric models\n(e.g., logistic regression). Extensive simulation studies show the utility of\nthe BAGofT when assessing general classification procedures and its strengths\nover some existing methods when testing parametric classification models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 05:55:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Sep 2021 02:49:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 04:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

A popular approach to\nreduce the size of a deep learning architecture consists in distilling\nknowledge from a bigger network (teacher) to a smaller one (student). Directly\ntraining the student to mimic the teacher representation can be effective, but\nit requires that both share the same latent space dimensions.

Specifically, under the current\nbeamforming design for IRS-assisted communications, $KMN+KM$ channel\ncoefficients should be estimated if the passive IRS cannot estimate its\nchannels with the base station (BS) and users due to its lack of radio\nfrequency (RF) chains, where $K$, $N$ and $M$ denote the number of users,\nreflecting elements of the IRS, and antennas at the BS, respectively. This\nnumber can be extremely large in practice considering the current trend of\nmassive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output), i.e., a large $M$, and massive\nconnectivity, i.e., a large $K$. To accurately estimate such a large number of\nchannel coefficients within a short time interval, we devote our endeavour in\nthis paper to investigating the efficient pilot-based channel estimation method\nin IRS-assisted uplink communications. Building upon the observation that the\nIRS reflects the signals from all the users to the BS via the same channels, we\nanalytically verify that a time duration consisting of $K+N+\\max(K-1,\\lceil\n(K-1)N/M \\rceil)$ pilot symbols is sufficient for the BS to perfectly recover\nall the $KMN+KM$ channel coefficients in the case without noise.

We summarize\nwell-known results from axisymmetric cases, give a new look at the latest 3D\nadvances, and present an overview of the expectations for the field in the\ncoming years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 07:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-23"}

Thereby, we improve planning efficiency by focusing computation\non promising contact locations. Second, we use a hybrid approach for perception\nand state estimation that combines neural networks with a physically meaningful\nstate representation.

TTP combines the knapsack\nproblem (KP) and the travelling salesman problem (TSP). A thief performs a\ncyclic tour through a set of cities, and pursuant to a collection plan,\ncollects a subset of items into a rented knapsack with finite capacity. The aim\nis to maximise profit while minimising renting cost. Existing TTP solvers\ntypically solve the KP and TSP components in an interleaved manner: the\nsolution of one component is kept fixed while the solution of the other\ncomponent is modified. This suggests low coordination between solving the two\ncomponents, possibly leading to low quality TTP solutions. The 2-OPT heuristic\nis often used for solving the TSP component, which reverses a segment in the\ntour. Within TTP, 2-OPT does not take into account the collection plan, which\ncan result in a lower objective value. This in turn can result in the tour\nmodification to be rejected by a solver. We propose an expanded form of 2-OPT\nto change the collection plan in coordination with tour modification. Items\nregarded as less profitable and collected in cities located earlier in the\nreversed segment are substituted by items that tend to be more profitable and\nnot collected in cities located later in the reversed segment. The collection\nplan is further changed through a modified form of the hill-climbing bit-flip\nsearch, where changes in the collection state are only permitted for boundary\nitems, which are defined as lowest profitable collected items or highest\nprofitable uncollected items. This restriction reduces the time spent on the KP\ncomponent, allowing more tours to be evaluated by the TSP component within a\ntime budget. The proposed approaches form the basis of a new cooperative\ncoordination solver, which is shown to outperform several state-of-the-art TTP\nsolvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 08:41:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 09:06:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 07:29:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

For spin-$1$ the strong coupling\nscale (at which perturbative unitarity is lost) cannot be raised by any finite\ntuning of the interactions, while for spin-$2$ there exists a special tuning of\nthe Wilson coefficients which can raise this scale (and enjoys numerous special\nproperties such as ghost-freedom). Here, we fill in the missing piece by\ndescribing how the self-interactions of a massive spin-$3/2$ field, or \"massive\ngravitino\", become strongly coupled at high energies. We show that while\nseveral different structures appear in the leading order potential, the strong\ncoupling scale cannot be raised (in the absence of additional fields). At the\nlevel of the off-shell Lagrangian, it is always the non-linear symmetries of\nthe longitudinal Stuckelberg mode that dictate the strong coupling, and we show\nthat in general it is only possible to parametrically raise the strong coupling\nscale if Wess-Zumino structures exist. We complement this off-shell approach\nwith a first analysis of positivity bounds for a massive spin-$3/2$ particle,\nshowing that any potential self-interaction which contributes to an on-shell\n2-to-2 elastic process at tree level must vanish if this low-energy theory is\nto have a standard UV completion.

Each local operator is only privately\naccessible to each agent, and all agents constitute a network. To seek a fixed\npoint of the global operator, it is indispensable for agents to exchange local\ninformation and update their solution cooperatively.

The\nframework is founded on the idea that it is possible in a suitably configured\nnetwork to identify a source of reliable proxy data for each sensor site that\nhas a similar probability distribution of measurement values over a suitable\ntime period. Previous work successfully applied these ideas to a sensor system\nwith a simple linear 2-parameter (slope and offset) response. Applying these\nideas to electrochemical sensors for NO2 presents significant additional\ndifficulties for which we demonstrate solutions. The three NO2 sensor response\nparameters (offset, ozone (O3) response slope, and NO2 response slope) are\nknown to vary significantly as a consequence of ambient humidity and\ntemperature variations. Here we demonstrate that these response parameters can\nbe estimated by minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence between\nsensor-estimated and proxy NO2 distributions over a 3-day window. We then\nestimate an additional offset term by using co-location data. This offset term\nis dependent on climate and spatially correlated and can thus be projected\nacross the network. Co-location data also estimates the time-, space- and\nconcentration-dependent error distribution between sensors and regulatory-grade\ninstruments. We show how the parameter variations can be used to indicate both\nsensor failure and failure of the proxy assumption.

Key to this framework is the concept of a\nproxy: a reliable (regulatory) data source whose results have sufficient\nstatistical similarity over some period of time to those from any given\nlow-cost measurement site. This enables the low-cost instruments to be\ncalibrated remotely, avoiding the need for costly on-site calibration of dense\nnetworks. This paper assesses the suitability of this method for local air\npollutants such as nitrogen dioxide which show large temporal and spatial\nvariability in concentration. The proxy technique is evaluated using the data\nfrom the network of regulatory air monitoring stations measuring nitrogen\ndioxide in Southern California to avoid errors introduced by low-cost\ninstrument performance. Proxies chosen based on land use similarity signalled\ntypically less than 0.1 percent false alarms. Although poor proxy performance\nwas observed when the local geography was unusual (a semi-enclosed valley) in\nthis instance the closest neighbour station proved to be an appropriate\nalternative. The method also struggled when wind speeds were low and very local\nsources presumably dominated the concentration patterns. Overall, we\ndemonstrate that the technique can be applied to nitrogen dioxide, and that\nappropriate proxies can be found even within a spatially sparse network of\nstations in a region with large spatio-temporal variation in concentration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 09:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

For the case of cosmic strings, this\nhas so far been calibrated using small numbers of Goto-Nambu and field theory\nsimulations, in the radiation and matter eras, as well as in Minkowski\nspacetime. But the model is only as good as the available simulations, and it\nshould be extended as further simulations become available. In previous work we\npresented a General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit implementation of the\nevolution of cosmological domain wall networks, and used it to obtain an\nimproved VOS model for domain walls. Here we continue this effort, exploiting a\nmore recent analogous code for local Abelian-Higgs string networks. The\nsignificant gains in speed afforded by this code enabled us to carry out 1032\nfield theory simulations of $512^3$ size, with 43 different expansion rates.\nThis detailed exploration of the effects of the expansion rate on the network\nproperties in turn enables a statistical separation of various dynamical\nprocesses affecting the evolution of the network. We thus extend and accurately\ncalibrate the VOS model for cosmic strings, including separate terms for energy\nlosses due to loop production and scalar/gauge radiation. By comparing this\nnewly calibrated VOS model with the analogous one for domain walls we\nquantitatively show that energy loss mechanisms are different for the two types\nof defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 10:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

If measured, this faint signal imprinted by the primordial\ngravitational wave background, would be an evidence of the inflation epoch and\nquantify its energy scale, providing a rigorous test of fundamental physics far\nbeyond the reach of accelerators. At the unprecedented sensitivity level that\nthe new generation of CMB experiments aims to reach, every uncontrolled\ninstrumental systematic effect will potentially result in an analysis bias that\nis larger than the much sought-after CMB B-mode signal. The absolute\ncalibration of the polarisation angle is particularly important in this sense,\nas any associated error will end up in a leakage from the much larger E modes\ninto B modes. The Crab nebula (Tau A), with its bright microwave synchrotron\nemission, is one of the few objects in the sky that can be used as absolute\npolarisation calibrators. In this communication, we review the best current\nconstraints on its polarisation angle from 23 to 353 GHz, at typical angular\nscales for CMB observations, from WMAP, IRAM XPOL, Planck and NIKA data. We\nwill show that these polarisation angle measurements are compatible with a\nconstant angle and we will present a study of the uncertainty on this mean\nangle, making different considerations on how to combine the individual\nmeasurement errors. For each of the cases, the potential impact on the CMB\nB-mode spectrum will be explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 10:17:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-27"}

Semantic segmentation is an\nefficient approach for this task. The latest development in deep convolutional\nneural networks (DCNNs) has made accurate pixel-level classification tasks\npossible. Yet one central issue remains: the precise delineation of boundaries.\nDeep architectures generally fail to produce fine-grained segmentation with\naccurate boundaries due to their progressive down-sampling. Hence, we introduce\na generic framework to overcome the issue, integrating the graph convolutional\nnetwork (GCN) and deep structured feature embedding (DSFE) into an end-to-end\nworkflow. Furthermore, instead of using a classic graph convolutional neural\nnetwork, we propose a gated graph convolutional network, which enables the\nrefinement of weak and coarse semantic predictions to generate sharp borders\nand fine-grained pixel-level classification. Taking the semantic segmentation\nof building footprints as a practical example, we compared different feature\nembedding architectures and graph neural networks. Our proposed framework with\nthe new GCN architecture outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Although our\nmain task in this work is building footprint extraction, the proposed method\ncan be generally applied to other binary or multi-label segmentation tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 10:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

Atmospheric superrotating flows at the equator are an almost\nubiquitous result of simulations of hot Jupiters, and a theory explaining how\nthis zonally coherent flow reaches an equilibrium has been developed in the\nliterature. However, this understanding relies on the existence of either an\ninitial superrotating or a sheared flow, coupled with a slow evolution such\nthat a linear steady state can be reached. Aims. A consistent physical\nunderstanding of superrotation is needed for arbitrary drag and radiative\ntimescales, and the relevance of considering linear steady states needs to be\nassessed. Methods. We obtain an analytical expression for the structure,\nfrequency and decay rate of propagating waves in hot Jupiter atmospheres around\na state at rest in the 2D shallow water beta plane limit. We solve this\nexpression numerically and confirm the robustness of our results with a 3D\nlinear wave algorithm. We then compare with 3D simulations of hot Jupiter\natmospheres and study the non linear momentum fluxes. Results. We show that\nunder strong day night heating the dynamics does not transit through a linear\nsteady state when starting from an initial atmosphere in solid body rotation.\nWe further show that non linear effects favour the initial spin up of\nsuperrotation and that the acceleration due to the vertical component of the\neddy momentum flux is critical to the initial development of superrotation.\nConclusions. Overall, we describe the initial phases of the acceleration of\nsuperrotation, including consideration of differing radiative and drag\ntimescales, and conclude that eddy-momentum driven superrotating equatorial\njets are robust, physical phenomena in simulations of hot Jupiter atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 11:03:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Recently, so-called full-history recursive multilevel Picard (MLP)\napproximation methods have been introduced to tackle the problem of\napproximately solving high-dimensional PDEs.

Most of these approaches employ supervised machine\nlearning algorithms which are, in general, very data hungry. This hampers the\nattempts to forecast some of these data series, particularly the ones that\ndepend on (relatively) recent space observations. Here we focus on an attempt\nto forecast the solar surface longitudinally averaged radial magnetic field\ndistribution using a form of spatial-temporal neural networks. Given that the\nrecording of these spatial-temporal datasets only started in 1975 and are\ntherefore quite short, the forecasts are predictably quite modest. However,\ngiven that there is a potential physical relationship between sunspots and the\nmagnetic field, we employ another machine learning technique called transfer\nlearning which has recently received considerable attention in the literature.\nHere, this approach consists in first training the source spatial-temporal\nneural network on the much longer time/latitude sunspot area dataset, which\nstarts in 1874, then transferring the trained set of layers to a target\nnetwork, and continue training the latter on the magnetic field dataset. The\nemployment of transfer learning in the field of computer vision is known to\nobtain a generalized set of feature filters that can be reused for other\ndatasets and tasks. Here we obtain a similar result, whereby we first train the\nnetwork on the spatial-temporal sunspot area data, then the first few layers of\nthe neural network are able to identify the two main features of the solar\ncycle, i.e. the amplitude variation and the migration to the equator, and\ntherefore can be used to train on the magnetic field dataset and forecast\nbetter than a prediction based only on the historical magnetic field data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 11:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

However, the main drawback of polar\ncodes is the low throughput of its successive cancellation (SC) decoding.\nSimplified SC decoding algorithms of polar codes can be used to reduce the\nlatency of the polar decode by faster processing of specific sub-codes in the\npolar code. By combining simplified SC with a list decoding technique, such as\nSC list (SCL) decoding, polar codes can cater to the two conflicting\nrequirements of high reliability and low latency in ultra-reliable low-latency\n(URLLC) communication systems. Simplified SC algorithm recognizes some special\nnodes in the SC decoding tree, corresponding to the specific subcodes in the\npolar code construction, and efficiently prunes the SC decoding tree, without\ntraversing the sub-trees and computing log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for each\nchild node. However, this decoding process still suffers from the latency\nassociated with the serial nature of SC decoding. We propose some new\nalgorithms to process new types of node patterns that appear within multiple\nlevels of pruned sub-trees and it enables to process of certain nodes in\nparallel. In short blocklength polar codes, our proposed algorithm can achieve\nup to $13\\%$ latency reduction from fast-simplified SC \\cite{Sarkis2013}\nwithout any performance degradation.

The resulting counterpart to the Schwarzschild\nclassical geometry substitutes the presence of an event horizon by a wormhole\nthroat that connects an external asymptotically flat region with an internal\nasymptotic region possessing a naked singularity: there are no semiclassical\nvacuum solutions with well-defined Cauchy surfaces. We also show that the\nRegularized Polyakov RSET allows for wormhole geometries of arbitrarily small\nthroat radius. This analysis paves the way to future investigations of proper\nstellar configurations with an internal non-vacuum region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 12:23:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 23:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-08"}

In a company-level\ncooperation, allowing the remaining companies to use a trained model that\ncontains the memories from a revoked company is obviously unacceptable, because\nit can lead to a big conflict of interest. Therefore, we emphatically discuss\nthe participant revocation problem of federated learning and design a revocable\nfederated random forest (RF) framework, RevFRF, to further illustrate the\nconcept of revocable federated learning. In RevFRF, we first define the\nsecurity problems to be resolved by a revocable federated RF. Then, a suite of\nhomomorphic encryption based secure protocols are designed for federated RF\nconstruction, prediction and revocation. Through theoretical analysis and\nexperiments, we show that the protocols can securely and efficiently implement\ncollaborative training of an RF and ensure that the memories of a revoked\nparticipant in the trained RF are securely removed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 13:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

To illustrate this approach, a model\nfor a nonlinear device coupled with a hydraulic actuator plays the role of an\nactual plant and a nonlinear algebraic function is considered as an\napproximation of the nonlinear device, thus generating non-parametric and\nparametric uncertainties. Then we use displacement and force signals to improve\nthe distribution of the states by resampling the set of particles. Finally, all\nof the states are estimated from these posterior density functions.

Our work models the formation and spread of\nnegative attitudes via WoM on a social network represented by a directed graph.\nIn an online learning setting, we examine how an agent could simultaneously\nlearn diffusion parameters and choose sets of seed users to initiate diffusions\nand maximize positive influence. In contrast to edge-level feedback, in which\nan agent observes the relationship (edge) through which a user (node) is\ninfluenced, we more realistically assume node-level feedback, where an agent\nonly observes when a user is influenced and whether that influence is positive\nor negative. Methodology/results: We propose a new class of negativity-aware\nLinear Threshold Models.

Therefore,\nwhen maximizing positive influence by selecting a seed set of fixed size, a\ngreedy algorithm can guarantee a solution with a constant approximation ratio.\nFor the online learning setting, we propose an algorithm that runs in epochs of\ngrowing lengths, each consisting of a fixed number of exploration rounds\nfollowed by an increasing number of exploitation rounds controlled by a\nhyperparameter.

Using various methods, we find that\n[CII] mostly originates from the neutral gas. We show that [CII] mostly traces\nthe CO-dark H2 gas but there is evidence of a weak contribution from neutral\natomic gas preferentially in the faintest components. Most of the molecular gas\nis CO-dark. The fraction of CO-dark H2 gas decreases with increasing CO column\ndensity, with a slope that seems to depend on the impinging radiation field\nfrom nearby massive stars. Finally we extend previous measurements of the\nphotoelectric-effect heating efficiency, which we find is constant across\nregions probed with Herschel, with [CII] and [OI] being the main coolants in\nfaint and diffuse, and bright and compact regions, respectively, and with PAH\nemission tracing the CO-dark H2 gas heating where [CII] and [OI] emit. Our\nstudy highlights the importance of velocity-resolved PDR diagnostics and higher\nspatial resolution for HI observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 14:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

In the absence of rotation, a\nrelatively small isotropic 2D RD-SOC leads to the generation of ghost vortices\nfor initially miscible BECs, while it gives rise to the creation of rectangular\nvortex-antivortex lattices for initially immiscible BECs. As the strength of\nthe 2D RD-SOC enhances, the visible vortices or the 2D vortex-antivortex chains\nare created for the former case, whereas the rectangular vortex-antivortex\nlattices are transformed into vortex-antivortex rings for the later case. For\nthe initially immiscible BECs with fixed 2D RD-SOC strength, the increase of\nrotation frequency can result in the structural phase transition from square\nvortex lattice to irregular triangular vortex lattice and the system transition\nfrom initial phase separation to phase mixing. In addition, we analyze the\ncombined effects of 1D RD-SOC and rotation on the vortex configurations of the\nground states for the case of initial phase separation. The increase of 1D SOC\nstrength, rotation frequency or both of them may result in the formation of\nvortex chain and phase mixing.

In practice, it is reasonable to assume that a\nlimited amount of labels can be obtained, potentially at a cost. Therefore,\nalgorithms that can effectively and efficiently incorporate this information to\nimprove the clustering model are desirable. In this paper, we propose an active\nlearning framework for subspace clustering that sequentially queries\ninformative points and updates the subspace model. The query stage of the\nproposed framework relies on results from the perturbation theory of principal\ncomponent analysis, to identify influential and potentially misclassified\npoints. A constrained subspace clustering algorithm is proposed that\nmonotonically decreases the objective function subject to the constraints\nimposed by the labelled data.

The two jets, a\nsurface-climbing jet and the Worthington jet, may appear successively during\none impact event. By carefully tuning the impact condition, we find that the\ntwo-jet phenomenon is jointly controlled by the droplet-pool viscosity ratio,\nthe droplet Weber number, and the droplet-pool miscibility. The mechanism of\nthe surface-climbing jet is completely different from that of the Worthington\njet: the liquid in the pool climbs along the surface of the droplet and forms a\nliquid layer which converges at the droplet apex and produces the\nsurface-climbing jet.

The presented approach guarantees\nrecursive constraint satisfaction and input-to-state stability with respect to\nthe model-plant mismatch. Simulation studies underline that the Gaussian\nprocess prediction model can be successfully and efficiently learned online.\nThe resulting computational load is significantly reduced via the combination\nof the recursive update procedure and by limiting the number of training data\npoints while maintaining good performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 15:14:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 09:36:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 05:13:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 10:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-25"}

Nanodiamond powder rich in negatively charged\nNitrogen Vacancy (NV) defect centers has recently emerged as one such promising\nplatform, wherein 13C nuclei can be hyperpolarized through the optically pumped\ndefects completely at room temperature and at low magnetic fields. Given the\ncompelling possibility of relaying this 13C polarization to nuclei in external\nliquids, there is an urgent need for the engineered production of highly\n\"hyperpolarizable\" diamond particles. In this paper, we report on a systematic\nstudy of various material dimensions affecting optical 13C hyperpolarization in\ndiamond particles -- especially electron irradiation and annealing conditions\nthat drive NV center formation. We discover surprisingly that diamond annealing\nat elevated temperatures close to 1720C have remarkable effects on the\nhyperpolarization levels, enhancing them by upto 36-fold over materials\nannealed through conventional means. We unravel the intriguing material origins\nof these gains, and demonstrate they arise from a simultaneous improvement in\nNV electron relaxation time and coherence time, as well as the reduction of\nparamagnetic content, and an increase in 13C relaxation lifetimes. Overall this\npoints to significant recovery of the diamond lattice from radiation damage as\na result of the high-temperature annealing. Our work suggests methods for the\nguided materials production of fluorescent, 13C hyperpolarized, nanodiamonds\nand pathways for their use as multi-modal (optical and MRI) imaging and\nhyperpolarization agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 15:23:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

This physical situation have\nbeen widely study by mean of thin film approximations in the case of small\ncharacteristic high of the fluid considering its strong interaction with the\nfixed boundary. Here, instead of considering any simplification leading to\nasymptotic models, we deal with the complete free boundary problem.

To implement thermo field dynamics we apply a unitary\ntransformation to discrete quantum mechanical operators to make new\nHamiltonians with encoded temperature dependence.

This\ntechnology is able to record electricity load time series at a very high\nfrequency rates, information that can be exploited to develop new clustering\nmodels to group individual households by similar consumptions patterns. To this\nend, in this work we propose three hierarchical clustering methodologies that\nallow capturing different characteristics of the time series. These are based\non a set of \"dissimilarity\" measures computed over different features: quantile\nauto-covariances, and simple and partial autocorrelations. The main advantage\nis that they allow summarizing each time series in a few representative\nfeatures so that they are computationally efficient, robust against outliers,\neasy to automatize, and scalable to hundreds of thousands of smart meters\nseries. We evaluate the performance of each clustering model in a real-world\nsmart meter dataset with thousands of half-hourly time series. The results show\nhow the obtained clusters identify relevant consumption behaviors of households\nand capture part of their geo-demographic segmentation. Moreover, we apply a\nsupervised classification procedure to explore which features are more relevant\nto define each cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 15:47:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

Depending on our observation, although more layers and connections\ncould always improve performance, the increase of model parameters is not\nconducive to launch application of SR algorithms.

Parameters of convolutional layers within each\nblock are shared to expand receptive fields while maintain the amount of\ntunable parameters unchanged.

True nature of density oscillations are\nrepresented by analytical formulas for degenerate conditions. Analytical\ncharacterization is first done for completely degenerate case, then temperature\neffects are also incorporated with a finer approximation.

While the timescale\nseparation required by weak turbulence is well verified experimentally\nregardless of the gravity level, the nonlinear and dissipation timescales are\nfound to be independent of the scale, as a result of the finite size effects of\nthe system (large-scale container modes) that are not taken currently into\naccount theoretically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 14:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Currently, these voluminous audits must be manually analyzed\nby officials for oversight, risk management, and prioritization purposes.\nAutomated summarization has the potential to streamline these processes.\nAnalysis focused on the \"Findings\" section of ~20,000 Single Audits spanning\n2016-2018. Following text preprocessing and GloVe embedding, sentence-level\nk-means clustering was performed to partition sentences by topic and to\nestablish the importance of each sentence. For each audit, key summary\nsentences were extracted by proximity to cluster centroids. Summaries were\njudged by non-expert human evaluation and compared to human-generated summaries\nusing the ROUGE metric. Though the goal was to fully automate summarization of\nA-133 audits, human input was required at various stages due to large\nvariability in audit writing style, content, and context. Examples of human\ninputs include the number of clusters, the choice to keep or discard certain\nclusters based on their content relevance, and the definition of a top\nsentence. Overall, this approach made progress towards automated extractive\nsummaries of A-133 audits, with future work to focus on full automation and\nimproving summary consistency.

The Kochen-Specker theorem and\nBell's inequality, enforced by the recent loophole-free experimental tests,\nreject a realist view that any observable has its own value at any time\nconsistent with the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics, and favor a\nskeptical view that measuring an observable does not mean ascertaining the\nvalue that it has, but producing the outcome, having only a personal meaning.\nHowever, precise analysis supporting this view is unknown.

We ask whether they always obtain\nthe same outcomes, or their probability distributions are the same but the\noutcomes are uncorrelated.

This suggests the existence of a correlation between the measurement\noutcome and the pre-existing value of the measured observable as a common cause\nfor the coincidence of the outcomes. In fact, we shall show that any\nmeasurement establishes a time-like entanglement between the observable to be\nmeasured and the meter after the measurement, which causes the space-like\nentanglement between the meters of different observers. We also argue that our\nconclusion cannot be extended to measurements of so-called \"generalized\"\nobservables, suggesting a demand for more careful analysis on the notion of\nobservables in foundations of quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 12:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

For $\\lambda\\neq 0$ these\noperators are reducible ( by B. Veinberg and V. Grushin method) to elliptical\nmatrices and the boundary value problems satisfy the conditions of V.\nSolonnikov's ellipticity. Useful properties of solutions of these spectral\nproblems follow from the theory and estimates. The $\\nabla \\text{div}$ and $\n\\text{rot}$ operators have self-adjoint extensions $\\mathcal{N}_d$ and\n$\\mathcal{S}$ in orthogonal subspaces $\\mathcal{A}_{\\gamma }$ and\n$\\mathbf{V}^0$ which formed from potential and vortex fields in\n$\\mathbf{L}_{2}(G)$. Their eigenvectors forme orthogonal basis in\n$\\mathcal{A}_{\\gamma }$ and $\\mathbf{V}^0$ elements of which are presented by\nFourier series and operators are transformations of series. We define analogues\nof Sobolev spaces $\\mathbf{A}^{2k}_{\\gamma }$ and $\\mathbf{W}^m$ orders of $2k$\nand $m$ in classes of potential and vortex fields and classes $ C (2k,m)$ of\ntheir direct sums. It is proved that if $\\lambda\\neq Sp(\\mathrm{rot})$ the\noperator $ \\text{rot}+\\lambda\\,I$ displays the class $C(2k,m+1)$ on the class\n$C(2k,m)$ one-to-one and continuously.

However, there is a lack of large\ndatasets with multiple activities, such as typing, gait and swipe performed by\nthe same person. Furthermore, large datasets with multiple activities performed\non multiple devices by the same person are non-existent. The difficulties of\nprocuring devices, participants, designing protocol, secure storage and\non-field hindrances may have contributed to this scarcity. The availability of\nsuch a dataset is crucial to forward the research in behavioral biometrics as\nusage of multiple devices by a person is common nowadays. Through this paper,\nwe share our dataset, the details of its collection, features for each modality\nand our findings of how keystroke features vary across devices. We have\ncollected data from 117 subjects for typing (both fixed and free text), gait\n(walking, upstairs and downstairs) and touch on Desktop, Tablet and Phone. The\ndataset consists a total of about: 3.5 million keystroke events; 57.1 million\ndata-points for accelerometer and gyroscope each; 1.7 million data-points for\nswipes; and enables future research to explore previously unexplored directions\nin inter-device and inter-modality biometrics. Our analysis on keystrokes\nreveals that in most cases, keyhold times are smaller but inter-key latencies\nare larger, on hand-held devices when compared to desktop. We also present;\ndetailed comparison with related datasets; possible research directions with\nthe dataset; and lessons learnt from the data collection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 15:24:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 18:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-20"}
