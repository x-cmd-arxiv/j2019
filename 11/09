The challenge is the extreme\nnon-rigid distortions of the caricatures introduced by exaggerating the facial\nfeatures to strengthen the characters. In this paper, we propose dynamic\nmulti-task learning based on deep CNNs for cross-modal caricature-visual face\nrecognition. Instead of the conventional multi-task learning with fixed weights\nof the tasks, the proposed dynamic multi-task learning dynamically updates the\nweights of tasks according to the importance of the tasks, which enables the\ntraining of the networks focus on the hard task instead of being stuck in the\novertraining of the easy task.

This paper is the first attempt in the literature to study and\naddress this problem. By carefully modeling the participation costs and rewards\nreceived within a strategic interaction scenario, we first empirically show\nthat even a small number of nodes defecting to participate in the protocol\ntasks due to insufficiency of the available incentives can result in the\nAlgorand network failing to compute and add new blocks of transactions.

Computing closeness efficiently\nfor individual vertices received considerable attention. The NP-hard problem of\ngroup closeness maximization, in turn, is more challenging: the objective is to\nfind a vertex group that is central as a whole and state-of-the-art heuristics\nfor it do not scale to very big graphs yet.\n  In this paper, we present new local search heuristics for group closeness\nmaximization. By using randomized approximation techniques and dynamic data\nstructures, our algorithms are often able to perform locally optimal decisions\nefficiently. The final result is a group with high (but not optimal) closeness\ncentrality.\n  We compare our algorithms to the current state-of-the-art greedy heuristic\nboth on weighted and on unweighted real-world graphs. For graphs with hundreds\nof millions of edges, our local search algorithms take only around ten minutes,\nwhile greedy requires more than ten hours. Overall, our new algorithms are\nbetween one and two orders of magnitude faster, depending on the desired group\nsize and solution quality. For example, on weighted graphs and $k = 10$, our\nalgorithms yield solutions of $12,4\\%$ higher quality, while also being\n$793,6\\times$ faster.

A GPU consists of several StreamingMulti-processors (SMs) that\ncollectively determine how shared resources are partitioned and accessed.\nRecent years have seen divergent paths in SM scaling towards scale-up (fewer,\nlarger SMs) vs. scale-out (more, smaller SMs). However, neither scaling up nor\nscaling out can meet the scalability requirement of all applications running on\na given GPU system, which inevitably results in performance degradation and\nresource under-utilization for some applications. In this work, we investigate\nmajor design parameters that influence GPU scaling. We then propose AMOEBA, a\nsolution to GPU scaling through reconfigurable SM cores. AMOEBA monitors and\npredicts application scalability at run-time and adjusts the SM configuration\nto meet program requirements. AMOEBA also enables dynamic creation of\nheterogeneous SMs through independent fusing or splitting. AMOEBA is a\nmicroarchitecture-based solution and requires no additional programming effort\nor custom compiler support.

However, accurate evaluation of derivatives,\nespecially of high order, is infeasible when the data are noisy, which has a\ndramatic negative effect on the result of regression.

Until now, most\nof the research effort has focused on achieving various applications based on\nbeacon communication. However, the power consumption on beacon devices becomes\nthe bottleneck for the large-scale deployments of indoor networks. On one hand,\nthe size of beacon devices is required to be small enough for easy deployment,\nwhich further limits the size of battery. On the other hand, replacing the\nbatteries of the beacon devices could lead to high maintenance costs. It is\nimportant to provide them with full energy autonomy. To tackle this problem we\npropose BEH: an indoor beacon system aimed at operating perpetually without\nbatteries. Our contributions are twofold. Firstly, we propose four methods to\nincrease the utilization efficiency of harvested RF energy in the beacon\nsystem, by which the energy consumption level becomes low enough to fit within\nthe energy harvesting budget. Secondly, we implement BEH using Bluetooth Low\nEnergy (BLE) and Radio Frequency (RF) energy harvesting devices, and test BEH\nextensively in a laboratory environment. Our test results show that BEH can\nenable perpetual lifetime operation of mobile and static BLE beacon devices in\na (16 m$^{\\text{2}}$) room.

The paper first focuses on the\nmathematical development and validation of the ALE-CFR scheme and then its\napplication on the problem. The rotational oscillation frequencies were taken\ncorresponding to the four primary vortex shedding mode frequencies discovered\nfrom the studies conducted by Tokumaru and Dimotakis. The transverse\noscillation frequency was varied for a frequency ratio $f_{tv}$ with respect to\nnatural strouhal frequency for flow past a stationary circular cylinder from\n$0.9 \\leq f_{tv} \\leq 3.0$. The amplitude ratio for transverse oscillations was\ntaken as 0.2 with respect to the cylinder diameter.

However, if they are limited in number, DW transmits provide lower\nimage quality compared with classical focused schemes. A conventional\nreconstruction approach consists in summing series of ultrasound signals\ncoherently, at the expense of the frame rate. To deal with this limitation, we\npropose a convolutional neural networks (CNN) architecture for high-quality\nreconstruction of DW ultrasound images using a small number of transmissions.\nGiven the spatially varying properties of DW images along depth, we adopted the\ninception model composed of the concatenation of multi-scale convolutional\nkernels. Incorporating inception modules aims at capturing different image\nfeatures with multi-scale receptive fields. A mapping between low-quality\nimages and corresponding high-quality compounded reconstruction was learned by\ntraining the network using in vitro and in vivo samples. The performance of the\nproposed approach was evaluated in terms of contrast-to-noise ratio and lateral\nresolution, and compared with standard compounding method and conventional CNN\nmethods. The results demonstrate that our method could produce high-quality\nimages using only three DWs, yielding an image quality equivalent to the one\nobtained with standard compounding of 31 DWs and outperforming more\nconventional CNN architectures in terms of complexity, inference time and image\nquality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 18:07:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 18:02:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 14:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

In the proposed\nmethod, we generate haptic force feedback based on the difference between a\ncommand issued by the human operator and the safe command returned by a CBF. In\nthis way, if the user issues an unsafe control command, the haptic feedback\nwill help guide the user towards the safe input command that is closest to\ntheir current command.

However the availability of such wireless channel modeling is\nfundamentally challenging in practice as channels are typically unknown a\npriori and only available through data samples. In this work we aim to develop\nalgorithms that rely on channel sample data to determine the stability and\nperformance of networked control tasks. In this regard our work is the first to\ncharacterize the amount of channel modeling that is required to answer such a\nquestion.

This\nillustrates that it becomes impractical to verify stability under a large range\nof plant and channel configurations.

To address the above issue in a more principled\nmanner, we propose a new computational framework for robust and efficient\nfine-tuning for pre-trained language models.

On the other hand, asynchrony implies inherent challenges in\nunderstanding the execution of the algorithm and its convergence, stemming from\nthe fact that the contribution of a thread might be based on an old (stale)\nview of the state.

Progress has been hampered by a lack\nof robust empirical constraints on the giant molecular cloud (GMC) lifecycle.\nWe address this problem by systematically applying a new statistical method for\nmeasuring the evolutionary timeline of the GMC lifecycle, star formation, and\nfeedback to a sample of nine nearby disc galaxies, observed as part of the\nPHANGS-ALMA survey. We measure the spatially-resolved ($\\sim100$ pc)\nCO-to-H$\\alpha$ flux ratio and find a universal de-correlation between\nmolecular gas and young stars on GMC scales, allowing us to quantify the\nunderlying evolutionary timeline. GMC lifetimes are short, typically 10-30 Myr,\nand exhibit environmental variation, between and within galaxies. At kpc-scale\nmolecular gas surface densities $\\Sigma_{\\rm\nH_2}\\geqslant8$M$_{\\odot}$pc$^{-2}$, the GMC lifetime correlates with\ntime-scales for galactic dynamical processes, whereas at $\\Sigma_{\\rm\nH_2}\\leqslant8$M$_{\\odot}$pc$^{-2}$ GMCs decouple from galactic dynamics and\nlive for an internal dynamical time-scale. After a long inert phase without\nmassive star formation traced by H$\\alpha$ (75-90% of the cloud lifetime), GMCs\ndisperse within just 1-5 Myr once massive stars emerge. The dispersal is most\nlikely due to early stellar feedback, causing GMCs to achieve integrated star\nformation efficiencies of 4-10% These results show that galactic star formation\nis governed by cloud-scale, environmentally-dependent, dynamical processes\ndriving rapid evolutionary cycling. GMCs and HII regions are the fundamental\nunits undergoing these lifecycles, with mean separations of 100-300 pc in\nstar-forming discs.

Despite\nthe critical importance of synaptosomes, the mechanisms of their formation\nremain not well understood. Because of the multi-site nature of participating\nproteins, it is widely believed that their search for specific sites on DNA\ninvolves the formation and breaking of DNA loops and sliding in the looped\nconfigurations. In reality, DNA in live cells is densely covered by other\nbiological molecules that might interfere with the formation of synaptosomes.\nIn this work, we developed a theoretical approach to evaluate the role of\nobstacles in the target search of multi-site proteins when the formation of DNA\nloops and the sliding in looped configurations are possible.

In addition,\nthe relative positions of the target and the obstacle strongly influence the\ntarget search kinetics. Furthermore, the presence of the obstacle might\nincrease the noise in the system.

Since the distribution of\ngalaxies is determined by galaxy formation physics as well as the underlying\ncosmology, fitting an observed correlation function yields valuable insights\ninto both. The calculation for a 2PCF involves computing pair-wise separations\nand consequently, the computing time scales quadratically with the number of\ngalaxies. The next-generation galaxy surveys are slated to observe many\nmillions of galaxies, and computing the 2PCF for such surveys would be\nprohibitively time-consuming. Additionally, modern modelling techniques require\nthe 2PCF to be calculated thousands of times on simulated galaxy catalogues of\n{\\em at least} equal size to the data and would be completely unfeasible for\nthe next generation surveys.

The\ncorrelation-adjusted mean method is unbiased and has reduced variance so it\ngains additional power. Several simulation studies are designed to show the\nestimation accuracy of the correlation structure, effectiveness in reducing\nvariance, and capability of obtaining more power.

We observe\nnon-cavitating, cyclic and transitional cavitation regimes with reduction in\nfreestream $\\sigma$. The cavitation inside the Karman vortices in the cyclic\nregime, is significantly altered by the onset of \"condensation front\"\npropagation in the transitional regime. At the transition, an order of\nmagnitude jump in shedding Strouhal number is observed as the dominant\nfrequency shifts from periodic vortex shedding in the cyclic regime, to\nirregular-regular vortex shedding in the transitional regime. In addition, a\npeak in pressure fluctuations, and a maximum in St versus $\\sigma$ based on\ncavity length are observed at the transition. Shedding characteristics in each\nregime are discussed using dynamic mode decomposition. It is demonstrated that\nthe condensation fronts observed in the transitional regime are supersonic\n(referred as \"condensation shocks\"). In the presence of NCG, multiple\ncondensation shocks in a given cycle are required for complete cavity\ncondensation and detachment, as compared to a single condensation shock when\nonly vapor is present. This is explained by the reduction in pressure ratio\nacross the shock in the presence of NCG effectively reducing its strength. In\naddition, at $\\sigma=0.85$ (near transition from the cyclic to the transitional\nregime), presence of NCG suppresses the low frequency irregular-regular vortex\nshedding. Vorticity transport at $Re=3900$, in the transitional regime,\nindicates that the region of attached cavity is nearly two-dimensional with\nvery low vorticity, affecting Karman shedding in the near wake. In addition,\nthe boundary-layer separation point is found to be strongly dependent on the\namounts of vapor and gas in the freestream for both laminar and turbulent\nregimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 23:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

The degrees of freedom is a mathematically convenient way to define\nthis number of parameters. Its computation and properties are well understood\nwhen dealing with discretized linear models, possibly regularized using\nsparsity. In this paper, we argue that this way of thinking is plagued when\ndealing with models having very large parameter spaces. In this case it makes\nmore sense to consider \"off-the-grid\" approaches, using a continuous parameter\nspace. This type of approach is the one favoured when training multi-layer\nperceptrons, and is also becoming popular to solve super-resolution problems in\nimaging. Training these off-the-grid models with a sparsity inducing prior can\nbe achieved by solving a convex optimization problem over the space of\nmeasures, which is often called the Beurling Lasso (Blasso), and is the\ncontinuous counterpart of the celebrated Lasso parameter selection method. In\nprevious works, the degrees of freedom for the Lasso was shown to coincide with\nthe size of the smallest solution support. Our main contribution is a proof of\na continuous counterpart to this result for the Blasso. Our findings suggest\nthat discretized methods actually vastly over-estimate the number of intrinsic\ncontinuous degrees of freedom. Our second contribution is a detailed study of\nthe case of sampling Fourier coefficients in 1D, which corresponds to a\nsuper-resolution problem. We show that our formula for the degrees of freedom\nis valid outside of a set of measure zero of observations, which in turn\njustifies its use to compute an unbiased estimator of the prediction risk using\nthe Stein Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 23:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

Structural\nbrain network (e.g. DTI) and functional brain network (e.g. fMRI) are the\nprimary networks of interest. Most existing works in brain network analysis\nfocus on either structural or functional connectivity, which cannot leverage\nthe complementary information from each other. Although multi-view learning\nmethods have been proposed to learn from both networks (or views), these\nmethods aim to reach a consensus among multiple views, and thus distinct\nintrinsic properties of each view may be ignored. How to jointly learn\nrepresentations from structural and functional brain networks while preserving\ntheir inherent properties is a critical problem. In this paper, we propose a\nframework of Siamese community-preserving graph convolutional network (SCP-GCN)\nto learn the structural and functional joint embedding of brain networks.\nSpecifically, we use graph convolutions to learn the structural and functional\njoint embedding, where the graph structure is defined with structural\nconnectivity and node features are from the functional connectivity. Moreover,\nwe propose to preserve the community structure of brain networks in the graph\nconvolutions by considering the intra-community and inter-community properties\nin the learning process. Furthermore, we use Siamese architecture which models\nthe pair-wise similarity learning to guide the learning process. To evaluate\nthe proposed approach, we conduct extensive experiments on two real brain\nnetwork datasets.

Deep inside the dielectric\nhost at a distance z0 from the surface, no signal arrives until t=z0/c, where c\nis the speed of light in vacuum. Immediately after this point, a weak but\nextremely high frequency signal is observed at z=z0. This so-called Sommerfeld\nforerunner (or precursor) is highly chirped, meaning that its frequency, which\nis much greater than {\\omega}_s immediately after t=z0/c, declines rapidly with\nthe passage of time. The incident light with its characteristic frequency\n{\\omega}_s eventually arrives at t~z0/vg , where vg is the group velocity of\nthe incident light inside the host medium.

This is\nespecially true for measurements of emitters at temperatures close to that of\nthe environment, where the impact of background emission is relatively large.\nIn this paper, we describe, recommend, and demonstrate general procedures for\nthermal-emission measurements that are applicable to most experimental\nconditions, including less-common and more-challenging cases that include\nthermal emitters with temperature-dependent emissivity and emitters that are\nnot in thermal equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2019 00:27:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 20:45:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

In current practice, the structures are adjusted to the design shape\nin terms of the $\\ell_2$ loss for further assembly without considering the\nexisting dimensional gap between two structures. Such practice has two\nlimitations: (1) the design shape may not be the optimal shape in terms of a\npair of incoming fuselages with different incoming dimensions; (2) the maximum\ngap is the key concern during the fuselage assembly process. This paper\nproposes an optimal shape control methodology via the $\\ell_\\infty$ loss for\ncomposite fuselage assembly process by considering the existing dimensional gap\nbetween the incoming pair of fuselages. Besides, due to the limitation on the\nnumber of available actuators in practice, we face an important problem of\nfinding the best locations for the actuators among many potential locations,\nwhich makes the problem a sparse estimation problem. We are the first to solve\nthe optimal shape control in fuselage assembly process using the $\\ell_\\infty$\nmodel under the framework of sparse estimation, where we use the $\\ell_1$\npenalty to control the sparsity of the resulting estimator. From statistical\npoint of view, this can be formulated as the $\\ell_\\infty$ loss based linear\nregression, and under some standard assumptions, such as the restricted\neigenvalue (RE) conditions, and the light tailed noise, the non-asymptotic\nestimation error of the $\\ell_1$ regularized $\\ell_\\infty$ linear model is\nderived to be the order of $O(\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{S\\log p}{n}})$, which meets the\nupper-bound in the existing literature. Compared to the current practice, the\ncase study shows that our proposed method significantly reduces the maximum gap\nbetween two fuselages after shape adjustments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2019 00:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

To address reversibility of finite CAs, we\ndevelop a mathematical tool, named reachability tree, which can efficiently\ncharacterize those CAs. A decision algorithm is proposed using minimized\nreachability tree which takes a CA rule and size n as input and verifies\nwhether the CA is reversible for that n. To decide reversibility of a finite\nCA, we need to know both the rule and the CA size. However, for infinite CAs,\nreversibility is decided based on the local rule only. Therefore, apparently,\nthese two cases seem to be divergent. This dissertation targets to construct a\nbridge between these two cases. To do so, reversibility of CAs is redefined and\nthe notion of semi-reversible CAs is introduced. Hence, we propose a new\nclassification of finite CAs -(1) reversible CAs, (2) semi-reversible CAs and\n(3) strictly irreversible CAs. Finally, relation between reversibility of\nfinite and infinite CAs is established. This dissertation also explores CAs as\nsource of randomness and build pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) based on\nCAs. We identify a list of properties for a CA to be a good source of\nrandomness. Two heuristic algorithms are proposed to synthesize candidate\n(decimal) CAs which have great potentiality as PRNGs. Two schemes tare\ndeveloped o use these CAs as window-based PRNGs - (1) as decimal number\ngenerators and as (2) binary number generators. We empirically observe that in\ncomparison to the best PRNG SFMT19937-64, average performance of our proposed\nPRNGs are slightly better. Hence, our decimal CAs based PRNGs are one of the\nbest PRNGs today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2019 04:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

The ASWs are robust to symmetric\nperturbations of the structure, but they become resonant modes if the\nperturbation is non-symmetric.

It has been shown that in\nmany applications such as active learning, robotics, sequential experimental\ndesign, and active detection, the utility function satisfies adaptive\nsubmodularity, a notion that generalizes the notion of diminishing returns to\npolicies. In this paper, we revisit the power of adaptivity in maximizing an\nadaptive monotone submodular function.

We start from an 8$\\times$8 Kane model\naccounting for the $s$--$p_z$ orbital mixing important to wurtzite structures,\nbut absent in zincblende, and apply both quasi-degenerate perturbation theory\n(L\\\"owdin partitioning) and the folding down approach to derive an effective\n2$\\times$2 electron Hamiltonian. We obtain the usual $k$-linear Rashba term\narising from the structural inversion asymmetry of the wells and, differently\nfrom zincblende structures, a bulk Rashba-type term induced by the inversion\nasymmetry of the wurtzite lattice. We also find linear- and cubic-in-momentum\nDresselhaus contributions. Both the bulk Rashba-type term and the Dresselhaus\nterms originate exclusively from the admixture of $s$- and $p_z$-like states in\nwurtzites structures. Interestingly, in these systems the linear Rashba and the\nDresselhaus terms have the same symmetry and can in principle cancel each other\nout completely, thus making the spin a conserved quantity.

Next we consider explicability in\ndevelopment, which means ability to make incremental improvement in prediction\naccuracy based on observed deficiency of the system. Inherent stochasticity of\nneural network based classifiers can be interpreted using likelihood randomness\nexplicability. Finally, sureness explicability indicates confidence of the\nclassifying system to make any prediction at all.\n  These concepts are examined in the framework of pairwise coupling, which is a\nnon-trainable metamodel that originated during development of support vector\nmachines. Several methodologies are evaluated, of which the key one is shown to\nbe the choice of the pairwise coupling method. We compare two methods: the\nestablished Wu-Lin-Weng method with the recently proposed Bayes covariant\nmethod. Our experiments indicate that the Wu-Lin-Weng method gives more weight\nto a single pairwise classifier, whereas the latter tries to balance\ninformation from the whole matrix of pairwise likelihoods. This translates into\nhigher accuracy, and better sureness predictions for the Bayes covariant\nmethod.\n  Pairwise coupling methodology has its costs, especially in terms of the\nnumber of parameters (but not necessarily in terms of training costs). However,\nwhen additional explicability aspects beyond accuracy are desired in an\napplication, the pairwise coupling models are a promising alternative to the\nestablished methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2019 09:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

First, our proposed cross-style\nclassifier trained with multiple styles together helps improve overall\nclassification performance against individually-trained style classifiers.\nSecond, our study shows that some styles are highly dependent on each other in\nhuman-written text. Finally, we find that combinations of some contradictive\nstyles likely generate stylistically less appropriate text.

There is now growing interest\nto extend the detection bandwidth to low frequency. The scientific potential of\nmulti-frequency GW astronomy is enormous as it would enable to obtain a more\ncomplete picture of cosmic events and mechanisms. This is a unique and entirely\nnew opportunity for the future of astronomy, the success of which depends upon\nthe decisions being made on existing and new infrastructures. The prospect of\ncombining observations from the future space-based instrument LISA together\nwith third generation ground based detectors will open the way towards\nmulti-band GW astronomy, but will leave the infrasound (0.1 Hz to 10 Hz) band\nuncovered. GW detectors based on matter wave interferometry promise to fill\nsuch a sensitivity gap. We propose the European Laboratory for Gravitation and\nAtom-interferometric Research (ELGAR), an underground infrastructure based on\nthe latest progress in atomic physics, to study space-time and gravitation with\nthe primary goal of detecting GWs in the infrasound band. ELGAR will directly\ninherit from large research facilities now being built in Europe for the study\nof large scale atom interferometry and will drive new pan-European synergies\nfrom top research centers developing quantum sensors. ELGAR will measure GW\nradiation in the infrasound band with a peak strain sensitivity of $4.1 \\times\n10^{-22}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ at 1.7 Hz.

Particularly, we study the role of a 4-D Chern-Simons theory at\nthe origin of this PVED, the Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics, which\nviolates both Lorentz and parity symmetries. Then, we consider terrestrial and\nJovian scenarios where the influence of a modified (effective) magnetic field\ngenerated by the planets on the molecules is taken into account in the\ncalculation of PVED. Besides this quantity, we also calculate the relative\nquantity excess of an enantiomer over the other in a thermal bath. Finally, we\ncompare the obtained results with those ones from other models based on\nfundamental interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 17:37:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 13:22:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 18:35:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-03"}

Recognized as e-Sports, they may become an official part of the\nOlympic Games by 2020. However, a long waiting time for matchmaking will\nlargely affect players' experiences. We examine different matchmaking\nmechanisms for 2v2 games. By casting the mechanisms into a queueing theoretic\nframework, we decompose the rule design process into a sequence of decision\nmaking problems, and derive the optimal mechanism with minimum expected waiting\ntime. We further the result by exploring additional static as well as dynamic\nrule designs' impacts. In the static setting, we consider the game allows\nplayers to choose sides before the battle. In the dynamic setting, we consider\nthe game offers multiple zones for players of different skill levels. In both\nsettings, we examine the value of choice-free players. Closed form expressions\nfor the expected waiting time in different settings illuminate the guidelines\nfor online game rule designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2019 13:17:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-28"}

Over the past\ndecade, computer vision and pattern recognition based techniques have gained\ntraction for such inspection and defect detection tasks. An automated\nend-to-end trained system can potentially provide a low-cost, high throughput,\nand cheap alternative to manual visual inspection of these components. However,\nsuch systems require a huge amount of defective images for networks to\nunderstand complex defects. In this paper, a multi-phase deep learning based\ntechnique is proposed to perform accurate fault detection of rail-valves. Our\napproach uses a two-step method to perform high precision image segmentation of\nrail-valves resulting in pixel-wise accurate segmentation. Thereafter, a\ncomputer vision technique is used to identify faulty valves. We demonstrate\nthat the proposed approach results in improved detection performance when\ncompared to current state-of-theart techniques used in fault detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2019 03:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}
