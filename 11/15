We review the physics of the Zeeman effect and its practical\nuse in both extended gas and in masers. We discuss observational results for\nthe five species for which the Zeeman effect has been detected in the ISM --\nH~I, OH, and CN in extended gas and OH, CH$_3$OH, and H$_2$O in masers. These\nspecies span densities from $\\sim10$ cm$^{-3}$ to $\\sim10^{10}$ cm $^{-3}$,\nwhich allows magnetic fields to be measured over the full range of cloud\ndensities. However, there are significant limitations, including that only the\nline-of-sight component of the magnetic field strength can usually be measured\nand that there are often significant uncertainties about the physical\nconditions being sampled, particularly for masers. We discuss statistical\nmethods to partially overcome these limitations. The results of Zeeman\nobservations are that the mass to magnetic flux ratio is subcritical (gravity\ndominates magnetic support) at lower densities but supercritical for $N_H\n\\gtrsim 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. Above $n_H\\sim 300$ cm$^{-3}$, which is roughly the\ndensity at which clouds typically become self-gravitating, the strength of\nmagnetic fields increases approximately as $B \\propto n^{2/3}$, which suggest\nthat magnetic fields do not provide significant support at high densities. This\nis consistent with high-density clouds being supercritical. However, magnetic\nfields have a large range in strengths at any given density, so the role of\nmagnetic fields should differ significantly from one cloud to another. And for\nmaser regions the dependence of field strength on density may have a slightly\nlower slope. Turbulent reconnection theory seems to best match the Zeeman\nobservational results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 16:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}

We discuss the use of Minkowski Functionals (MFs) as\ncomplementary probes to increase the lensing Figure of Merit (FoM), for a\nsurvey made out of a wide total area $A_{\\rm{tot}}$ imaged at a limiting\nmagnitude $\\rm{mag_{W}}$ containing a subset of area $A_{\\rm{deep}}$ where\nobservations are pushed to a deeper limiting magnitude $\\rm{mag_{D}}$. We\npresent an updated procedure to match the theoretically predicted MFs to the\nmeasured ones, taking into account the impact of map reconstruction from noisy\nshear data. We validate this renewed method against simulated data sets with\ndifferent source redshift distributions and total number density, setting these\nquantities in accordance with the depth of the survey. We can then rely on a\nFisher matrix analysis to forecast the improvement in the FoM due to the joint\nuse of shear tomography and MFs under different assumptions on\n$(A_{\\rm{tot}},\\,A_{\\rm{deep}},\\,\\rm{mag_{D}})$, and the prior on the MFs\nnuisance parameters. It turns out that MFs can provide a valuable help in\nincreasing the FoM of the lensing survey, provided the nuisance parameters are\nknown with a non negligible precision. What is actually more interesting is the\npossibility to compensate for the loss of FoM due to a cut in the multipole\nrange probed by shear tomography, which makes the results more robust against\nuncertainties in the modeling of nonlinearities. This makes MFs a promising\ntool to both increase the FoM and make the constraints on the cosmological\nparameters less affected by theoretical systematic effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 17:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

Nevertheless, collagen networks do fracture\nwhen tissues are overloaded or subject to pathological conditions such as\naneurysms. Prior studies of the role of collagen in tissue fracture have mainly\nfocused on tendons, which contain highly aligned bundles of collagen. By\ncontrast, little is known about fracture of the orientationally more disordered\ncollagen networks present in many other tissues such as skin and cartilage.\nHere, we combine shear rheology of reconstituted collagen networks with\ncomputer simulations to investigate the primary determinants of fracture in\ndisordered collagen networks.

While preserving the causal relationship between temperature and\ncloud condensation, ExoREL is simple and fast to enable efficient exploration\nof parameter space. Using the model, we find that the mixing ratio of methane\nand the cloud top pressure of a giant exoplanet can be uniquely determined from\na single observation of its reflected light spectrum at wavelengths less than 1\nmicron if it has a cloud deck deeper than ~0.3 bars. This measurement is\nenabled by the weak and strong bands of methane and requires a signal-to-noise\nratio of 20. The cloud pressure once derived, provides information about the\ninternal heat flux of the planet. Importantly, we find that for a low,\nUranus-like internal heat flux, the planet can have a deep liquid water cloud,\nwhich will sequester ammonia and prevent the formation of the ammonia cloud\nthat would otherwise be the uppermost cloud layer.

Yet, the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription computes the\nboundary entropy expected from unitary CFT evolution. We demonstrate this in a\nnovel setting with an asymptotic bulk detector, eliminating an assumption about\nthe entanglement wedge of auxiliary systems.\n  We consider three interpretations of this result. (i) At face value,\ninformation is lost in the bulk but not in the CFT. This conflicts with the\nAdS/CFT dictionary. (ii) No unique QFT state (pure or mixed) governs all\ndetector responses to the bulk Hawking radiation. This conflicts with the\nexistence of an S-matrix. (iii) Nonlocal couplings to the black hole interior\ncause asymptotic detectors to respond as though the radiation was pure, even\nthough it is naively thermal. This invalidates the standard interpretation of\nthe semiclassical state, including its smoothness at the horizon.\n  We conclude that unitary boundary evolution requires asymptotic bulk\ndetectors to become unambiguously pure at late times. We ask whether the RT\nprescription can still reproduce the boundary entropy in this bulk scenario. We\nfind that this requires a substantial failure of semiclassical gravity in a\nlow-curvature region, such as a firewall that purifies the Hawking radiation.\n  Finally, we allow that the dual to semiclassical gravity may be an ensemble\nof unitary theories.

Aims: We\nstudy the constraints that a measurement of the core rotation rate of the Sun\ncould bring on magnetic angular momentum transport in stellar radiative zones.\nResults: We first show that models computed with angular momentum transport by\nmagnetic instabilities and a recent prescription for the braking of the stellar\nsurface by magnetized winds can reproduce the observations of surface\nvelocities of stars in open clusters. These solar models predict both a flat\nrotation profile in the external part of the solar radiative zone probed by\npressure modes and an increase in the rotation rate in the solar core, where\nthe stabilizing effect of chemical gradients plays a key role. A rapid rotation\nof the core of the Sun, as suggested by reported detections of gravity modes,\nis thus found to be compatible with angular momentum transport by magnetic\ninstabilities. Moreover, we show that the efficiency of magnetic angular\nmomentum transport in regions of strong chemical gradients can be calibrated by\nthe solar core rotation rate independently from the unknown rotational history\nof the Sun.

Recently, there has been mounting interest\nin analyzing this problem in the concurrent scenario, and several\nasymptotically-efficient algorithms have been proposed. Yet, to date, there is\nvery little known about the practical performance of concurrent Union-Find.\n  This work addresses this gap. We evaluate and analyze the performance of\nseveral concurrent Union-Find algorithms and optimization strategies across a\nwide range of platforms (Intel, AMD, and ARM) and workloads (social, random,\nand road networks, as well as integrations into more complex algorithms). We\nfirst observe that, due to the limited computational cost, the number of\ninduced cache misses is the critical determining factor for the performance of\nexisting algorithms. We introduce new techniques to reduce this cost by storing\nnode priorities implicitly and by using plain reads and writes in a way that\ndoes not affect the correctness of the algorithms. Finally, we show that\nUnion-Find implementations are an interesting application for Transactional\nMemory (TM): one of the fastest algorithm variants we discovered is a\nsequential one that uses coarse-grained locking with the lock elision\noptimization to reduce synchronization cost and increase scalability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 19:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-18"}

Based on a new feature vector, we use the multivariate\nGaussian mixture model (GMM) to do the radar point cloud segmentation, i.e.\n`point-wise' classification, in an unsupervised learning environment.

Recent imaging experiments have provided\ntime-dependent traces of individual cells, thus providing an unprecedented\npicture of tumor spheroid growth. By using simulations of a minimal cell model,\nwe analyze the experimental data that map the movement of cells in fibrosarcoma\ntumor spheroid embedded in a collagen matrix. Both simulations and experiments\nshow that cells in the core of the spheroid exhibit subdiffusive glassy\ndynamics (mean square displacement, $\\Delta(t) \\approx t^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha\n< 1$), whereas cells in the periphery exhibit superdiffusive motion, $\\Delta(t)\n\\approx t^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha>1)$. The motion of most of the cells near the\nperiphery undergo highly persistent and correlated directional motion, thus\nexplaining the observed superdiffusive behavior. The $\\alpha$ values for cells\nin the core and periphery, extracted from simulations and experiments are in\nnear quantitative agreement with each other, which is surprising given that no\nparameter in the model was used to fit the measurements. The qualitatively\ndifferent dynamics of cells in the core and periphery is captured by the fourth\norder susceptibility, introduced to characterize metastable states in glass\nforming systems. Analyses of the velocity autocorrelation of individual cells\nshow remarkable spatial heterogeneity with no two cells exhibiting similar\nbehavior. The prediction that $\\alpha$ should depend on the location of the\ncells in the tumor is amenable to experimental test. The highly heterogeneous\ndynamics of cells in the tumor spheroid provides a plausible mechanism for the\norigin of intratumor heterogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 20:59:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 09:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

A key challenge for image\nprocessing with contrast enhanced CT is that phase discrepancies are latent in\ndifferent tissues due to contrast protocols, vascular dynamics, and metabolism\nvariance. Previous studies with deep learning frameworks have been proposed for\nclassifying contrast enhancement with networks inspired by computer vision.\nHere, we revisit the challenge in the context of whole abdomen contrast\nenhanced CTs. To capture and compensate for the complex contrast changes, we\npropose a novel discriminator in the form of a multi-domain disentangled\nrepresentation learning network. The goal of this network is to learn an\nintermediate representation that separates contrast enhancement from anatomy\nand enables classification of images with varying contrast time. Briefly, our\nunpaired contrast disentangling GAN(CD-GAN) Discriminator follows the ResNet\narchitecture to classify a CT scan from different enhancement phases. To\nevaluate the approach, we trained the enhancement phase classifier on 21060\nslices from two clinical cohorts of 230 subjects. Testing was performed on 9100\nslices from 30 independent subjects who had been imaged with CT scans from all\ncontrast phases.

This work investigates how the thermoelectric\nproperties predicted with the DOS model compare to the other two scattering\nmodels, using three analytical electron dispersions (parabolic band in\n3D/2D/1D, Kane band in 3D/2D/1D, and ring-shaped quartic band in 2D).

One interpretation of these substructures is the\nexistence of embedded planets. Not until recently, however, most of the\nmodelling effort to interpret these observations ignored the dust back reaction\nto the gas. In this work, we conduct local-shearing-sheet simulations for an\nisothermal, inviscid, non-self-gravitating, razor-thin dusty disc with a planet\non a fixed circular orbit. We systematically examine the parameter space\nspanned by planet mass ($0.1M_\\text{th} \\le M_\\text{p} \\le 1M_\\text{th}$, where\n$M_\\text{th}$ is the thermal mass), dimensionless stopping time ($10^{-3} \\le\n\\tau_\\text{s} \\le 1$), and solid abundance ($0 < Z \\le 1$). We find that when\nthe dust particles are tightly coupled to the gas ($\\tau_\\text{s} < 0.1$), the\nspiral arms are less open and the gap driven by the planet becomes deeper with\nincreasing $Z$, consistent with a reduced speed of sound in the approximation\nof a single dust-gas mixture. By contrast, when the dust particles are\nmarginally coupled ($0.1 \\lesssim \\tau_\\text{s} \\lesssim 1$), the spiral\nstructure is insensitive to $Z$ and the gap structure in the gas can become\nsignificantly skewed and unidentifiable. When the latter occurs, the pressure\nmaximum radially outside of the planet is weakened or even extinguished, and\nhence dust filtration by a low-mass ($M_\\text{p} < M_\\text{th}$) planet could\nbe reduced or eliminated.

Previous research has highlighted the benefits of achieving\nrepresentations that are disentangled, particularly for downstream tasks.\nHowever, there is some debate about how to encourage disentanglement with VAEs\nand evidence indicates that existing implementations of VAEs do not achieve\ndisentanglement consistently. The evaluation of how well a VAE's latent space\nhas been disentangled is often evaluated against our subjective expectations of\nwhich attributes should be disentangled for a given problem. Therefore, by\ndefinition, we already have domain knowledge of what should be achieved and yet\nwe use unsupervised approaches to achieve it. We propose a weakly-supervised\napproach that incorporates any available domain knowledge into the training\nprocess to form a Gated-VAE. The process involves partitioning the\nrepresentational embedding and gating backpropagation. All partitions are\nutilised on the forward pass but gradients are backpropagated through different\npartitions according to selected image/target pairings. The approach can be\nused to modify existing VAE models such as beta-VAE, InfoVAE and DIP-VAE-II.\nExperiments demonstrate that using gated backpropagation, latent factors are\nrepresented in their intended partition. The approach is applied to images of\nfaces for the purpose of disentangling head-pose from facial expression.\nQuantitative metrics show that using Gated-VAE improves average\ndisentanglement, completeness and informativeness, as compared with un-gated\nimplementations. Qualitative assessment of latent traversals demonstrate its\ndisentanglement of head-pose from expression, even when only weak/noisy\nsupervision is available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 01:46:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-18"}

In this paper, we propose to leverage this\nconnection to improve the relation extraction accuracy. Our key ideas are\ntwofold: (1) For sentences belonging to the same relation class, the expression\nstyle, i.e. words choice, can vary according to the query entities. To account\nfor this style shift, the model should adjust its parameters in accordance with\nentity types. (2) Some relation classes are semantically similar, and the\nentity types appear in one relation may also appear in others. Therefore, it\ncan be trained cross different relation classes and further enhance those\nclasses with few samples, i.e., long-tail classes. To unify these two\narguments, we developed a novel Dynamic Neural Network for Relation Extraction\n(DNNRE). The network adopts a novel dynamic parameter generator that\ndynamically generates the network parameters according to the query entity\ntypes and relation classes. By using this mechanism, the network can\nsimultaneously handle the style shift problem and enhance the prediction\naccuracy for long-tail classes.

The strain-induced spin anisotropy in KFAT allows us to probe\nits nematic susceptibility, revealing a divergent-like increase upon cooling,\nindicating the ordered ground state is driven by a spin-orbital entangled\nnematic order parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 06:52:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-13"}

An application of SSM is to identify\nmultiple seed sets that have the same influence power as a seed set found by\ninfluence maximization in a social network. To test two graphs for isomorphism,\ncanonical labeling has been studied to relabel a graph in such a way that\nisomorphic graphs are identical after relabeling. Efficient canonical labeling\nalgorithms have been designed by individualization-refinement. They enumerate\nall permutations using a search tree, and select the minimum as the canonical\nlabeling, which prunes candidates during enumeration. Despite high performance\nin benchmark graphs, these algorithms face difficulties in handling massive\ngraphs. In this paper, we design a new efficient canonical labeling algorithm\nDviCL. Different from previous algorithms, we take a divide-&-conquer approach\nto partition G. By partitioning G, an AutoTree is constructed, which preserves\nsymmetric structures and the automorphism group of G. The canonical labeling\nfor a tree node can be obtained by the canonical labeling of its child nodes,\nand the canonical labeling for the root is the one for G. Such AutoTree can\nalso be effectively used to answer the automorphism group, symmetric subgraphs.\nWe conducted extensive performance studies using 22 large graphs, and confirmed\nthat DviCL is much more efficient and robust than the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 08:25:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-18"}

We calculate the nuclear modification of $\\text{B}$ and $\\text{D}$\nmeson spectra as well as spectra of leptons from heavy flavor decays in the\nrapidity range $[-4.0,4.0]$. We use an implementation of the improved Langevin\nequation with gluon radiation on top of a (3+1)-dimensional relativistic\nviscous hydrodynamical background for several collision setups. We find that\nthe rapidity dependence of the heavy quark modification is determined by the\ninterplay between the smaller size of the medium, which affects the path length\nof the heavy quarks, and the softer heavy quark initial production spectrum. We\ncompare our results with available experimental data and present predictions\nfor open heavy flavor meson $R_\\text{AA}$ at finite rapidity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 09:10:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

In this paper, we introduce A3GAN, an Attribute-Aware\nAttentive face aging model to address the above issues. Facial attribute\nvectors are regarded as the conditional information and embedded into both the\ngenerator and discriminator, encouraging synthesized faces to be faithful to\nattributes of corresponding inputs. To improve the visual fidelity of\ngeneration results, we leverage the attention mechanism to restrict\nmodifications to age-related areas and preserve image details. Moreover, the\nwavelet packet transform is employed to capture textural features at multiple\nscales in the frequency space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our model in synthesizing photorealistic aged face images and\nachieving state-of-the-art performance on popular face aging datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 09:21:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-18"}

It enables programmable and flexible management and\ndeployment of the network. Network function virtualization (NFV) is referred to\nthe deployment of software functions running on commodity servers instead of\ntraditional hardware-based middle-boxes. It is an example of network\nsoftwarization. In NFV, a service is defined as a chain of software functions\nnamed service chain function (SFC). The process of allocating the resources of\nservers to the services, called service placement, is the most challenging\nmission in NFV. Dynamic nature of the service arrivals and departures as well\nas meeting the service level agreement make the service placement problem even\nmore challenging. In this paper, we propose a model for dynamic\nreliability-aware service placement based on the simultaneous allocation of the\nmain and backup servers. Then, we formulate the dynamic reliability-aware\nservice placement as an infinite horizon Markov decision process (MDP), which\naims to minimize the placement cost and maximize the number of admitted\nservices. In the proposed MDP, the number of active services in the network is\nconsidered to be the state of the system, and the state of the idle resources\nis estimated based on it. Also, the number of possible admitted services is\nconsidered as the action of the presented MDP. To evaluate each possible action\nin the proposed MDP, we use a sub-optimal method based on the Viterbi algorithm\nnamed Viterbi-based Reliable Static Service Placement (VRSSP) algorithm. We\ndetermine the optimal policy based on value iteration method using an algorithm\nnamed VRSSP-based Value Iteration (VVI) algorithm. Eventually, through the\nextensive simulations, the superiority of the proposed model for dynamic\nreliability-aware service placement compared to the static solutions is\ninferred.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 09:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-18"}

In the climate system, the atmospheric\nboundary layer can experience sudden transitions between fully turbulent states\nand quiescent, quasi-laminar states. Such rapid transitions are observed in\nPolar regions or at night when the atmospheric boundary layer is stably\nstratified, and they have important consequences in the strength of mixing with\nthe higher levels of the atmosphere. To analyze the stable boundary layer, many\napproaches rely on the identification of regimes that are commonly denoted as\nweakly and very stable regimes. Detecting transitions between the regimes is\ncrucial for modeling purposes. In this work a combination of methods from\ndynamical systems and statistical modeling is applied to study these regime\ntransitions and to develop an early-warning signal that can be applied to\nnon-stationary field data. The presented metric aims at detecting nearing\ntransitions by statistically quantifying the deviation from the dynamics\nexpected when the system is close to a stable equilibrium. An idealized\nstochastic model of near-surface inversions is used to evaluate the potential\nof the metric as an indicator of regime transitions.

Aims: In order to confirm the viability of\nthat scenario, we extend this investigation to three dimensional,\ntime-dependent, models. Methods: We use a 3D GCM, DYNAMICO to perform a series\nof calculations designed to explore the formation and structure of the driving\natmospheric circulations, and detail how it responds to changes in both upper\nand deep atmospheric forcing. Results: In agreement with the previous, 2D,\nstudy, we find that a hot adiabat is the natural outcome of the long-term\nevolution of the deep atmosphere. Integration times of order $1500$ years are\nneeded for that adiabat to emerge from an isothermal atmosphere, explaining why\nit has not been found in previous hot Jupiter studies. Models initialised from\na hotter deep atmosphere tend to evolve faster toward the same final state. We\nalso find that the deep adiabat is stable against low-levels of deep heating\nand cooling, as long as the Newtonian cooling time-scale is longer than $\\sim\n3000$ years at $200$ bar. Conclusions: We conclude that the steady-state\nvertical advection of potential temperature by deep atmospheric circulations\nconstitutes a robust mechanism to explain hot Jupiter inflated radii. We\nsuggest that future studies of hot Jupiters are evolved for a longer time than\ncurrently done, and, when possible, include models initialised with a hot deep\nadiabat. We stress that this mechanism stems from the advection of entropy by\nirradiation induced mass flows and does not require (finely tuned) dissipative\nprocess, in contrast with most previously suggested scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 10:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

The annealing reduces surface recombination, while preserving\nrelatively high bulk charge separation efficiency.

Detecting 142 compact sources distributed over the whole observed\narea, we then used machine learning algorithms to group the compact cores in\ndifferent clusters. A total of four main clusters were identified: NGC 6334-E,\nNGC 6334-I, NGC 6334-I(N) and NGC 6334-I(NW). The typical separations between\ncluster members (4000-12000 au) together with the core masses (0.2-100\n$M_{\\odot}$) are in agreement with turbulent fragmentation at scales of 0.1 pc.\nWe find that the CMFs (core mass functions) show an excess of massive cores\ncompared to the IMF. Typical uncertainties in temperature or unresolved\nmultiplicity may mimic the observed excess of massive cores. Evidence of mass\nsegregation in NGC 6334-I and NGC 6334-I(N), with the most massive cores\nlocated closer to the center, was found. Correlations between the physical\nproperties of the clusters and their evolutionary stage were searched for, and\nfound to show a larger separation between cores in the more evolved clusters,\nfavouring the role of gas expulsion and stellar ejection over time. From these\nresults, we suggest that NGC 6334-I(N) was primordially segregated, while NGC\n6334-I may have become mass-segregated over time due to dynamical effects.\nFinally, the lack of massive cores in the most evolved cluster suggests that\nthe gas reservoir may be already exhausted, while the less evolved clusters\nstill have access to a larger gas mass reservoir. In general, the fragmentation\nin NGC 6334 at large scales (about 1 pc) is governed by turbulent pressure,\nwhile at smaller scales (a few hundred au), thermal pressure regulates the\nfragmentation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 11:58:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 18:24:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

Here, we present the\nreport of the nanoscopic diffusion mechanism of acetamide in a DES synthesized\nwith lithium perchlorate as studied using neutron scattering and molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulation techniques. Although, the acetamide based DES (ADES)\nhas remarkably lower freezing point compared to pure acetamide, the molecular\nmobility is found to be enormously restricted in the former. MD simulation\nindicates a diffusion model with two distinct processes, corresponding to, long\nrange jump diffusion and localised diffusion within a restricted volume. This\nmodel is validated by analysis of neutron scattering data in both molten\nacetamide and ADES. The long range diffusion process of acetamide is slower by\na factor of three in ADES in comparison with molten acetamide. MD simulation\nreveals that the long range diffusion in ADES is restricted mainly due to the\nformation of hydrogen bond mediated complexes between the ionic species of the\nsalt and acetamide molecules. Hence, the origin of higher viscosity observed in\nADES can be attributed to the complexation.

We propose to\novercome these by deforming a random point cloud to the object shape through\ntwo steps: feature blending and deformation. In the first step, the global and\npoint-specific shape features extracted from a 2D object image are blended with\nthe encoded feature of a randomly generated point cloud, and then this mixture\nis sent to the deformation step to produce the final representative point set\nof the object. In the deformation process, we introduce a new layer termed as\nGraphX that considers the inter-relationship between points like common graph\nconvolutions but operates on unordered sets. Moreover, with a simple trick, the\nproposed model can generate an arbitrary-sized point cloud, which is the first\ndeep method to do so.

An analysis of the flow field reveals a region of enhanced\nconvection near the wall, the sidewall circulation. The sidewall circulation\nrotates slowly within the cylinder in anticyclonic direction. It has a\nconvoluted structure, illustrated by mean flow fields in horizontal\ncross-sections of the flow where instantaneous snapshots are compensated for\nthe orientation of the sidewall circulation before averaging. Through separate\nanalysis of the sidewall region and the inner bulk flow, we find that for\nhigher values of the thermal forcing the heat transport in the inner part of\nthe cylindrical domain, outside the sidewall circulation region, coincides with\nthe heat transport on the unconfined periodic domain. Thus the sidewall\ncirculation accounts for the differences in heat transfer between the two\nconsidered domains, while in the bulk the turbulent heat flux is the same as\nthat of a laterally unbounded periodic domain. Therefore, experiments, with\ntheir inherent confinement, can still provide turbulence akin to the unbounded\ndomains of simulations, and at more extreme values of the governing parameters\nfor thermal forcing and rotation. We also provide experimental evidence for the\nexistence of the sidewall circulation that is in close agreement with the\nsimulation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 13:14:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 09:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

Understanding the nature and origin of\nthese structures through a kinematic study of the molecular gas is useful to\nadvance in our knowledge of the interplay between radiation and molecular gas.\nUsing ASTE we carried out molecular observations towards two cometary globules\n(Sim129 and Sim130) in the HII region Sh2-236. We mapped two regions with the\n12CO J=3-2 and HCO+ J=4-3 lines. Additionally, two single pointings of C2H\n(N=4-3), HNC and HCN J=4-3 were observed. We combined our observations with\npublic infrared and optical data to analyse the distribution and kinematics of\nthe gas.

The HCN/HNC integrated ratio of about 3 found in Sim130\nsuggests that the possible star formation activity within the globule has not\nyet ionized the gas. The location of NVSS 052255+33315, which peaks towards the\nbrightest border of the globule, supports this scenario. The non-detection of\nthese molecules towards Sim129 could be due to the radiation arising from the\nstar formation activity inside this globule. The ubiquitous presence of the C2H\nmolecule towards both globules shows the action of nearby O-B stars irradiating\ntheir external layers.

Metal-graphene interfaces represent a novel,\npromising and easy to implement technique to engineer such sharp lateral p-n\njunctions in graphene field-effect devices, in clear contrast to the much wider\n(i.e. smooth) junctions achieved via conventional local gating. In this work,\nwe present a systematic and robust investigation of the electrostatic problem\nof metal-induced lateral p-n junctions in gated graphene devices for\nelectron-optics applications, systems where the width of the created junctions\nis not only determined by the metal used but also depends on external factors\nsuch as device geometries, dielectric environment and different operational\nparameters such as carrier density and temperature.

Inspired by iterative\nstructure reduction for hidden community detection in social networks, we\npropose an Iterative Boost Convolutional LSTM Network (IBCLN) that enables\ncascaded prediction for reflection removal. IBCLN is a cascaded network that\niteratively refines the estimates of transmission and reflection layers in a\nmanner that they can boost the prediction quality to each other, and\ninformation across steps of the cascade is transferred using an LSTM. The\nintuition is that the transmission is the strong, dominant structure while the\nreflection is the weak, hidden structure. They are complementary to each other\nin a single image and thus a better estimate and reduction on one side from the\noriginal image leads to a more accurate estimate on the other side. To\nfacilitate training over multiple cascade steps, we employ LSTM to address the\nvanishing gradient problem, and propose residual reconstruction loss as further\ntraining guidance. Besides, we create a dataset of real-world images with\nreflection and ground-truth transmission layers to mitigate the problem of\ninsufficient data.

We aim to improve the understanding of the physical mechanisms behind\nthe slower than free-fall motion and the two-stage evolution (an initial phase\nof acceleration followed by an almost constant velocity phase) detected in\ncoronal rain events.\n  Methods. Using the Mancha3D code, we solve the 2D ideal MHD equations. We\nrepresent the solar corona as an isothermal vertically stratified atmosphere\nwith a uniform vertical magnetic field and the plasma condensation as a density\nenhancement described by a 2D Gaussian profile. We analyse the temporal\nevolution of the descending plasma and study its dependence on parameters such\nas density and magnetic field strength.\n  Results. We confirm previous findings that the pressure gradient is the main\nforce that opposes the action of gravity and slows down the blob descent and\nthat larger densities require larger pressure gradients to reach the constant\nspeed phase. We find that the shape of a condensation with a horizontal\nvariation of density is distorted as it falls, due to the denser parts of the\nblob falling faster than the lighter ones. This is explained by the fact that\nthe duration of the initial acceleration phase, and therefore the maximum\nfalling speed attained by the plasma, increases with the ratio of blob to\ncoronal density. We also find that the magnetic field plays a fundamental role\nin the evolution of the descending condensations. A strong enough magnetic\nfield (greater than 10 G in our simulations) forces each plasma element to\nfollow the path given by a particular field line, which allows to describe the\nevolution of each vertical slice of the blob in terms of 1D dynamics, without\ninfluence of the adjacent slices.

Equipped with a novel algorithm for one-stage group testing\nfrom [Coja-Oghlan, Gebhard, Hahn-Klimroth \\& Loick 2019], we propose a\npolynomial-time two-stage algorithm that matches the universal\ninformation-theoretic lower bound of group testing. This result improves on\nresults from [M\\'ezard \\& Toninelli 2011] and resolves open problems\nprominently posed in [Aldridge, Johnson \\& Scarlett 2019, Berger \\& Levenshtein\n2002, Damaschke \\& Muhammad 2012].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 14:13:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 12:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

Hence it is of critical importance to understand the minimal total data\nmovement achievable during the execution of an algorithm. The achieved total\ndata movement for different schedules of an algorithm can vary widely depending\non how efficiently the cache is used, e.g., untiled versus effectively tiled\nmatrix-matrix multiplication. A significant current challenge is that no\nexisting tool is able to meaningfully quantify the potential reduction to the\ndata movement of a computation that can be achieved by more effective use of\nthe cache through operation rescheduling. Asymptotic parametric expressions of\ndata movement lower bounds have previously been manually derived for a limited\nnumber of algorithms, often without scaling constants. In this paper, we\npresent the first compile-time approach for deriving non-asymptotic parametric\nexpressions of data movement lower bounds for arbitrary affine computations.\nThe approach has been implemented in a fully automatic tool (IOLB) that can\ngenerate these lower bounds for input affine programs.\n  IOLB's use is demonstrated by exercising it on all the benchmarks of the\nPolyBench suite. The advantages of IOLB are many: (1) IOLB enables us to derive\nbounds for few dozens of algorithms for which these lower bounds have never\nbeen derived. This reflects an increase of productivity by automation. (2)\nAnyone is able to obtain these lower bounds through IOLB, no expertise is\nrequired.

Recently, GANs have been\nused to emulate complex physical systems such as turbulent flows. However, a\ncritical question must be answered before GANs can be considered trusted\nemulators for physical systems: do GANs-generated samples conform to the\nvarious physical constraints? These include both deterministic constraints\n(e.g., conservation laws) and statistical constraints (e.g., energy spectrum of\nturbulent flows). The latter have been studied in a companion paper (Wu et al.,\nEnforcing statistical constraints in generative adversarial networks for\nmodeling chaotic dynamical systems. Journal of Computational Physics. 406,\n109209, 2020). In the present work, we enforce deterministic yet imprecise\nconstraints on GANs by incorporating them into the loss function of the\ngenerator. We evaluate the performance of physics-constrained GANs on two\nrepresentative tasks with geometrical constraints (generating points on\ncircles) and differential constraints (generating divergence-free flow velocity\nfields), respectively. In both cases, the constrained GANs produced samples\nthat conform to the underlying constraints rather accurately, even though the\nconstraints are only enforced up to a specified interval. More importantly, the\nimposed constraints significantly accelerate the convergence and improve the\nrobustness in the training, indicating that they serve as a physics-based\nregularization. These improvements are noteworthy, as the convergence and\nrobustness are two well-known obstacles in the training of GANs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 14:44:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2020 05:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

A common approach that is adapted in digital\nassistants when responding to a user query is to process the input in a\npipeline manner where the first task is to predict the domain, followed by the\ninference of intent and slots. However, this cascaded approach instigates error\npropagation and prevents information sharing among these tasks. Further, the\nuse of words as the atomic units of meaning as done in many studies might lead\nto coverage problems for morphologically rich languages such as German and\nFrench when data is limited. We address these issues by introducing a\ncharacter-level unified neural architecture for joint modeling of the domain,\nintent, and slot classification. We compose word-embeddings from characters and\njointly optimize all classification tasks via multi-task learning.

One key\nquestion is whether these isotopic reservoirs of nitrogen predate the comet\nformation stage or are posterior to it. Another central question is elucidating\nthe processes that can produce the observed variations in the 14N/15N isotopic\nratio. Disks that orbit pre-main-sequence stars provide unique opportunities\nfor observing the chemical content of analogs of the protosolar nebula and\ntherefore for building a comprehensive scenario for the origin of nitrogen in\nthe Solar System and in planet-forming disks. We present spectrally and\nspatially resolved observations of the hyperfine structure of the 4-3\nrotational transition of HCN and its main isotopologs H13CN and HC15N in the\ndisk orbiting the 8 Myr old TTauri star TW Hya. The spatially averaged\nHCN/H13CN and HCN/HC15N abundance ratios are 86+/-4 and 223+/-21, respectively.\nThe latter value is significantly lower than the CN:C15N ratio 323+/-30 in this\ndisk and thus provides the first evidence that two isotopic reservoirs of\nnitrogen are present in a disk at the stage of giant planet and comet\nformation. Furthermore, we find clear evidence for an increase in the ratio of\nHCN to HC15N with radius. The ratio in the outer disk is 339+/-28, in excellent\nagreement with direct measurements in the local interstellar medium, and with\nthe bulk nitrogen isotopic ratio predicted from galactic evolution\ncalculations. In the comet formation region at r=20 au, the ratio is a factor\n~3 lower, 121+/-11. This radial increase qualitatively agrees with the scenario\nin which selective photodissociation of N 2 is the dominant fractionation\nprocess. However, our isotopic ratios and kinetic temperature of the\nHCN-emitting layers quantitatively disagree with models of nitrogen chemistry\nin disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 14:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-18"}

However, manual data inspection is problematic\nfor privacy sensitive datasets, such as those representing the behavior of\nreal-world individuals. Furthermore, manual data inspection is impossible in\nthe increasingly important setting of federated learning, where raw examples\nare stored at the edge and the modeler may only access aggregated outputs such\nas metrics or model parameters. This paper demonstrates that generative models\n- trained using federated methods and with formal differential privacy\nguarantees - can be used effectively to debug many commonly occurring data\nissues even when the data cannot be directly inspected. We explore these\nmethods in applications to text with differentially private federated RNNs and\nto images using a novel algorithm for differentially private federated GANs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 14:56:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 22:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-06"}

They also feature non-thermal\ngamma-ray emission whose peak lies in the very high-energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV)\nrange, and in some sources exceeds 1TeV: this is the case of hard-TeV EHBLs\nsuch as 1ES 0229+200. With the aim of increasing the EHBL population, ten\ntargets were observed with the MAGIC telescopes from 2010 to 2017, for a total\nof 262 h of good quality data. The data were complemented by coordinated Swift\nobservations. The X-ray data analysis confirms that all the sources but two are\nEHBLs. The sources show only a modest variability and a harder-when-brighter\nbehavior, typical for this class of objects. At VHE gamma rays, three new\nsources were detected and a hint of signal was found for another new source. In\neach case the intrinsic spectrum is compatible with the hypothesis of a\nhard-TeV nature of these EHBLs. The broadband spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of all sources are built and modeled in the framework of a single-zone\npurely leptonic model. The VHE gamma-ray detected sources were also interpreted\nwith a spine-layer and a proton synchrotron models. The three models provide a\ngood description of the SEDs. However, the resulting parameters differ\nsubstantially in the three scenarios, in particular the magnetization\nparameter.

There are two common forms of pressure dependent potentials of mean\nforce (PMFs) derived from hydrophobic molecules available for the coarse\ngrained molecular simulations of protein folding and unfolding under\nhydrostatic pressure. Although both PMF includes a desolvation barrier\nseparating the well of a direct contact and the well of a solvent mediated\ncontact, how these features vary with hydrostatic pressure is still debated.\nThere is a need of a systematic comparison of these two PMFs on a protein. We\ninvestigated the two different pressure dependencies on the desolvation\npotential in a structure based protein model using coarse grained molecular\nsimulations. We compared them to the known behavior a real protein based on\nexperimental evidence. We showed that the protein s folding transition curve on\nthe pressure temperature phase diagram depends on the relationship between the\npotential well minima and pressure. For protein that reduces the total volume\nunder pressure, it is essential for the PMF to carry the feature that the\ndirect contact well is essential less stable than the water mediated contact\nwell at high pressure.

To accommodate the ever-increasing computational\ndemands of scientific applications, high-performance computing (HPC) systems\nhave become larger and more complex, offering parallelism at multiple levels\n(e.g., nodes, cores per node, threads per core). Scientific applications need\nto exploit all the available multilevel hardware parallelism to harness the\navailable computational power. The performance of applications executing on\nsuch HPC systems may adversely be affected by load imbalance at multiple\nlevels, caused by problem, algorithmic, and systemic characteristics.\nNevertheless, most existing load balancing methods do not simultaneously\naddress load imbalance at multiple levels. This work investigates the impact of\nload imbalance on the performance of three scientific applications at the\nthread and process levels.

The UAV processes the received\ncomputation tasks from the mobile users (MUs) by creating the corresponding\nvirtual machines. Due to finite shared I/O resource of the UAV in the MEC\nsystem, each MU competes to schedule local as well as remote task computations\nacross the decision epochs, aiming to maximize the expected long-term\ncomputation performance. The non-cooperative interactions among the MUs are\nmodeled as a stochastic game, in which the decision makings of a MU depend on\nthe global state statistics and the task scheduling policies of all MUs are\ncoupled.

In multi-view\nlearning problems, one instance can be represented by multiple heterogeneous\nfeatures, which are highly related but sometimes look different from each\nother. In addition, correlations between features from multiple views always\nvary greatly, which challenges the capability of multi-view learning methods.\nConsequently, constructing a multi-view learning framework with generalization\nand scalability, which could take advantage of multi-view information as much\nas possible, is extremely necessary but challenging.

Finally, the union of physics and information led to the emergence of\nQuantum Information Theory and the development of the quantum bit - the qubit -\nforming the basis of quantum computers. We have built the first programmable\nquantum computers, and although the technology is still in its early days,\nthese systems offer the potential to solve problems which even the most\npowerful classical computers cannot. The future of computing will look\nfundamentally different than it has in the past. It will not be based on more\nand cheaper bits alone, but rather, it will be built upon bits + neurons +\nqubits. This future will enable the next generation of intelligent\nmission-critical systems and accelerate the rate of science-driven discovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 12:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

However, the reality that underlies this\npresumption is by no means obvious; vision perception is based on remote\nsensing of the ecology, fundamentally different form that of the other senses,\nwhich have tactile stimulation origin (contact with matter). While its reality,\nas explicated here, explains why the above presumption is true, it also bears\nheavily on the mirror neuron theory: the revelation of the nature of vision\nmakes mirror neurons unnecessary. The extensive cognitive neurosciences\ninvestigation of primates and humans, over the past three decades, have\nexperimentally validated the theory of mirror neurons which had been put\nforward early in the period (1980s and 1990s) based on the results of cognitive\nresearch experiments on the macaque monkeys. Based on further experimental\nworks, phenomena such as learning, empathy, and some aspects of survival, are\nascribed to the operations of this class of additional neurons.

In this paper\nwe present a new conceptual framework for particle physics in which nontrivial\ngeometry and topology of space and time have fundamental reality. To develop\nthis model we proceed with the analysis of the standard wave equations and make\nthem real using the transformation rule $i=\\sqrt{-1} \\rightarrow\nC=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. Topological significance is\nattached to $i$ in terms of a point defect in 1D directed line. New\ninterpretation of Schroedinger wave equation and $Z_2$ vortex throw light on\nthe nature of spin.
