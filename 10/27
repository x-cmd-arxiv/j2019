However, these algorithms are neither accurate\nnor stable in motion-blurred videos. The missing of structure information makes\nit difficult for state-of-the-art facial landmark detection algorithms to yield\ngood results. In this paper, we propose a framework named FAB that takes\nadvantage of structure consistency in the temporal dimension for facial\nlandmark detection in motion-blurred videos. A structure predictor is proposed\nto predict the missing face structural information temporally, which serves as\na geometry prior. This allows our framework to work as a virtuous circle. On\none hand, the geometry prior helps our structure-aware deblurring network\ngenerates high quality deblurred images which lead to better landmark detection\nresults. On the other hand, better landmark detection results help structure\npredictor generate better geometry prior for the next frame.

To shed some light\non this issue, we have measured in a model-independent way the soft excess\nstrength in a flux-limited sample of broad-line and narrow-line Seyfert 1\ngalaxies (BLS1s and NLS1s) that are matched in X-ray luminosity but different\nin terms of the black hole mass and the accretion rate values, with NLS1s being\ncharacterized by smaller MBH and larger accretion rate values. Our analysis, in\nagreement with previous studies carried out with different AGN samples,\nindicates that: 1) a soft excess is ubiquitously detected in both BLS1s and\nNLS1s; 2) the strength of the soft excess is significantly larger in the NLS1\nsample, compared to the BLS1 sample; 3) combining the two samples, the strength\nof the soft excess appears to positively correlate with the photon index as\nwell as with the accretion rate, whereas there is no correlation with the black\nhole mass. Importantly, our work also reveals the lack of an anticorrelation\nbetween the soft excess strength and the luminosity of the primary X-ray\ncomponent, predicted by the absorption and reflection scenarios.

The seminal Gibbard-Satterthwaite\ntheorem shows that only few unappealing social choice rules can be implemented\nunless we assume some restrictions on the preferences or allow monetary\ntransfers. When monetary transfers are allowed and quasi-linear utilities\nw.r.t. money are assumed, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms were shown to\nimplement any affine-maximizer, and by the work of Roberts, only\naffine-maximizers can be implemented whenever the type sets of the agents are\nrich enough.\n  In this work, we generalize these results and define a new class of\npreferences: Preferences which are positive-represented by a quasi-linear\nutility. That is, agents whose preference on a subspace of the outcomes can be\nmodeled using a quasi-linear utility. We show that the characterization of VCG\nmechanisms as the incentive-compatible mechanisms extends naturally to this\ndomain. Our result follows from a simple reduction to the characterization of\nVCG mechanisms. Hence, we see our result more as a fuller more correct version\nof the VCG characterization.\n  This work also highlights a common misconception in the community attributing\nthe VCG result to the usage of transferable utility. Our result shows that the\nincentive-compatibility of the VCG mechanisms does not rely on money being a\ncommon denominator, but rather on the ability of the designer to fine the\nagents on a continuous (maybe agent-specific) scale.\n  We think these two insights, considering the utility as a representation and\nnot as the preference itself (which is common in the economic community) and\nconsidering utilities which represent the preference only for the relevant\ndomain, would turn out to fruitful in other domains as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Oct 2019 20:26:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

The\nsecond step is to find the maximal probability of reaching the already computed\nqualitative winning set.

Recently, flat\nbands have been realized in a variety of graphene-based heterostructures using\nthe tuning parameters of twist angle, layer stacking and pressure, and\nresulting in correlated insulator and superconducting states. Here we report\nthe experimental observation of similar correlated phenomena in twisted bilayer\ntungsten diselenide (tWSe2), a semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide\n(TMD). Unlike twisted bilayer graphene where the flat band appears only within\na narrow range around a \"magic angle\", we observe correlated states over a\ncontinuum of angles, spanning 4 degree to 5.1 degree. A Mott-like insulator\nappears at half band filling that can be sensitively tuned with displacement\nfield. Hall measurements supported by ab initio calculations suggest that the\nstrength of the insulator is driven by the density of states at half filling,\nconsistent with a 2D Hubbard model in a regime of moderate interactions. At 5.1\ndegree twist, we observe evidence of superconductivity upon doping away from\nhalf filling, reaching zero resistivity around 3 K. Our results establish\ntwisted bilayer TMDs as a model system to study interaction-driven phenomena in\nflat bands with dynamically tunable interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Oct 2019 21:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

Smoking accounts for a large part of the\nnonlinearities in the growth of life expectancy and of the geographic and sex\ndifferences in mortality. As Bongaarts (2006) and Janssen (2018) suggested,\naccounting for smoking could improve the quality of mortality forecasts due to\nthe predictable nature of the smoking epidemic. We propose a new Bayesian\nhierarchical model to forecast life expectancy at birth for both sexes and for\n69 countries with good data on smoking-related mortality. The main idea is to\nconvert the forecast of the non-smoking life expectancy at birth (i.e., life\nexpectancy at birth removing the smoking effect) into life expectancy forecast\nthrough the use of the age-specific smoking attributable fraction (ASSAF). We\nintroduce a new age-cohort model for the ASSAF and a Bayesian hierarchical\nmodel for non-smoking life expectancy at birth. The forecast performance of the\nproposed method is evaluated by out-of-sample validation compared with four\nother commonly used methods for life expectancy forecasting. Improvements in\nforecast accuracy and model calibration based on the new method are observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2019 03:26:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

This requires\ndeveloping models based on diverse EHR sources. Federated Learning (FL) has\nenabled predictive modeling using distributed training which lifted the need of\nsharing data and compromising privacy. Since models are distributed in FL, it\nis attractive to devise ensembles of Deep Neural Networks that also assess\nmodel uncertainty. We propose a new FL model called Federated Uncertainty-Aware\nLearning Algorithm (FUALA) that improves on Federated Averaging (FedAvg) in the\ncontext of EHR. FUALA embeds uncertainty information in two ways: It reduces\nthe contribution of models with high uncertainty in the aggregated model. It\nalso introduces model ensembling at prediction time by keeping the last layers\nof each hospital from the final round. In FUALA, the Federator (central node)\nsends at each round the average model to all hospitals as well as a randomly\nassigned hospital model update to estimate its generalization on that hospital\nown data. Each hospital sends back its model update as well a generalization\nestimation of the assigned model. At prediction time, the model outputs C\npredictions for each sample where C is the number of hospital models. The\nexperimental analysis conducted on a cohort of 87K deliveries for the task of\npreterm-birth prediction showed that the proposed approach outperforms FedAvg\nwhen evaluated on out-of-distribution data.

An important problem is how to automatically extract highlights\n(i.e., attractive short video clips) from these massive, long recorded live\nvideos. One approach is to directly apply a highlight extraction algorithm to\nvideo content. However, algorithmic approaches are either domain-specific,\nwhich require experts to spend a long time to design, or resource-intensive,\nwhich require a lot of training data and/or computing resources. In this paper,\nwe propose Lightor, a novel implicit crowdsourcing approach to overcome these\nlimitations. The key insight is to collect users' natural interactions with a\nlive streaming platform, and then leverage them to detect highlights. Lightor\nconsists of two major components. Highlight Initializer collects time-stamped\nchat messages from a live video and then uses them to predict approximate\nhighlight positions. Highlight Extractor keeps track of how users interact with\nthese approximate highlight positions and then refines these positions\niteratively. We find that the collected user chat and interaction data are very\nnoisy, and propose effective techniques to deal with noise. Lightor can be\neasily deployed into existing live streaming platforms, or be implemented as a\nweb browser extension. We recruit hundreds of users from Amazon Mechanical\nTurk, and evaluate the performance of Lightor using two popular games in\nTwitch. The results show that Lightor can achieve high extraction precision\nwith a small set of training data and low computing resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2019 07:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

We\nintroduce the common mechanism regression (CMR) model which assumes a shared\nleft low-rank component across all tasks, but allows an individual per-task\nright low-rank component. This dramatically reduces the number of samples\nneeded for accurate estimation. The problem of jointly recovering the common\nand the local components has a non-convex bi-linear structure.

To form molecules on a grain surface, adsorbed species\ntrapped in binding sites must be mobile and migrate to adjacent sites. Thermal\nhopping is a popular mechanism for the migration of adsorbed species when the\ngrain surface is warmed up by stellar radiation. However, previous studies\ndisregarded the fact that grains can be spun-up to suprathermal rotation by\nradiative torques (RATs) during grain heating process. To achieve an accurate\nmodel of surface astrochemistry, in this paper, we study the effect of grain\nsuprathermal rotation by RATs on thermal hopping of adsorbed species on icy\ngrain mantles. We find that centrifugal force due to grain suprathermal\nrotation can increase the mobility of radicals on/in the ice mantle compared to\nthe prediction by thermal hopping, and we term this mechanism ro-thermal\nhopping. The rate of ro-thermal hopping depends both on the local radiation\nenergy density (i.e., grain temperature) and gas density, whereas thermal\nhopping only depends on grain temperature. We calculate the decrease in grain\ntemperature required by ro-thermal hopping to produce the same hopping rate as\nthermal hopping and find that it increases with increasing the diffusion energy\nand decreasing the gas density. We finally study the effect of grain\nsuprathermal rotation on the segregation of ice mixtures and find that\nro-thermal segregation of CO$_2$ from H$_2$O-CO$_2$ ices can occur at much\nlower temperatures than thermal segregation reported by experiments. Our\nresults indicate that grain suprathermal rotation can enhance mobility,\nformation, desorption, and segregation of molecules in icy grain mantles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2019 08:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

Often, this approximation is\nhandled as standard supervised learning and the only difference is that the\nlabels are provided by the target classifier instead of ground truth. This\nparadigm is particularly popular because there exists a variety of well-studied\nsupervised algorithms for learning an interpretable classifier.

We consider the problem of inferring\nan inductive invariant of polynomial length given a transition system and a\nsafety property. We analyze the complexity of this problem in a black-box\nmodel, called the Hoare-query model, which is general enough to capture\nalgorithms such as IC3/PDR and its variants. An algorithm in this model learns\nabout the system's reachable states by querying the validity of Hoare triples.\n  We show that in general an algorithm in the Hoare-query model requires an\nexponential number of queries. Our lower bound is information-theoretic and\napplies even to computationally unrestricted algorithms, showing that no choice\nof generalization from the partial information obtained in a polynomial number\nof Hoare queries can lead to an efficient invariant inference procedure in this\nclass.\n  We then show, for the first time, that by utilizing rich Hoare queries, as\ndone in PDR, inference can be exponentially more efficient than approaches such\nas ICE learning, which only utilize inductiveness checks of candidates. We do\nso by constructing a class of transition systems for which a simple version of\nPDR with a single frame infers invariants in a polynomial number of queries,\nwhereas every algorithm using only inductiveness checks and counterexamples\nrequires an exponential number of queries.\n  Our results also shed light on connections and differences with the classical\ntheory of exact concept learning with queries, and imply that learning from\ncounterexamples to induction is harder than classical exact learning from\nlabeled examples. This demonstrates that the convergence rate of\nCounterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis depends on the form of\ncounterexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2019 12:59:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 13:27:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 Jan 2020 20:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

As presented in Baidu traffic report, the commuting stress\nindex has reached surprising 1.973 in Beijing during rush hours, which results\nin longer trip time and increased vehicular queueing. Previous works have\ndemonstrated that by reasonable scheduling, e.g, rebalancing bike-sharing\nsystems and optimized bus transportation, the traffic efficiency could be\nsignificantly improved with little resource consumption. However, there are\nstill two disadvantages that restrict their performance: (1) they only consider\nsingle scheduling in a short time, but ignoring the layout after first\nreposition, and (2) they only focus on the single transport.

Despite\nthe ionic migration being a reversible process, it often leads to worsening of\nperovskite based device performance, hysteresis in current-voltage\ncharacteristics, and phase segregation in mixed halide perovskites being as the\nmost harmful effect. The reason is in dynamical band structure changes, which\ncontrollable engineering would solve one of the biggest challenges for\ndevelopment of light-emitting solar cells. Here we demonstrate controllable\nband bending due to migration of both cation and anion ions in mixed halide\nperovskite devices. The band structure rearrangement is demonstrated in light\nemitting solar cells based on the perovskite with organic cations\nmethylammonium (MA+) and formamidinium (FA+), possessing non-zero dipole\nmomentum of 2.29 and 0.21 Debye, respectively, and with PEDOT:PSS and C60\ntransport layers having a high barrier of 0.8 eV for charge injection. Under\napplied external voltage MA+ and FA+ cations move towards the electron\ntransport layer and form a dipole layer at the perovskite/electron transport\ninterface, which lowers threshold voltage for electroluminescence down to 1.7 V\nfor MAPbBr2I and 2.6 V for FAPbBr2I, whereas monohalide perovskite MAPbBr3 does\nnot demonstrate such behavior. This ability to in-situ change the device band\nstructure paves the way developing of dual-functional devices based on simple\ndesign. It also makes mixed halide perovskites more flexible than mono halides\nones for developing different optoelectronic devices without the use of special\ntypes of work function modifying transport materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2019 15:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

GRPDA preserves all the favorable features\nof the classical primal-dual algorithm (PDA), i.e., the primal and the dual\nvariables are updated in a Gauss-Seidel manner, and the per iteration cost is\ndominated by the evaluation of the proximal point mappings of the two component\nfunctions and two matrix-vector multiplications. Compared with the classical\nPDA, which takes an extrapolation step, the novelty of GRPDA is that it is\nconstructed based on a convex combination of essentially the whole iteration\ntrajectory. We show that GRPDA converges within a broader range of parameters\nthan the classical PDA, provided that the reciprocal of the convex combination\nparameter is bounded above by the golden ratio, which explains the name of the\nalgorithm. An O(1/N) ergodic convergence rate result is also established based\non the primal-dual gap function, where N denotes the number of iterations. When\neither the primal or the dual problem is strongly convex, an accelerated GRPDA\nis constructed to improve the ergodic convergence rate from O(1/N) to O(1/N2).\nMoreover, we show for regularized least-squares and linear equality constrained\nproblems that the reciprocal of the convex combination parameter can be\nextended from the golden ratio to 2 and meanwhile a relaxation step can be\ntaken. Our preliminary numerical results on LASSO, nonnegative least-squares\nand minimax matrix game problems, with comparisons to some state-of-the-art\nrelative algorithms, demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2019 14:15:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 13:19:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 09:24:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 06:23:00 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 04:38:03 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2020 23:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-08"}

The recorded signals are typically a\ncombination of spikes and noise. High amounts of background noise and\npossibility of electric signaling recording from several neurons adjacent to\nthe recording site have led scientists to develop neuronal signal processing\ntools such as spike sorting to facilitate brain data analysis. Spike sorting\nplays a pivotal role in understanding the electrophysiological activity of\nneuronal networks. This process prepares recorded data for interpretations of\nneurons interactions and understanding the overall structure of brain\nfunctions. Spike sorting consists of three steps: spike detection, feature\nextraction, and spike clustering. There are several methods to implement each\nof spike sorting steps. This paper provides a systematic comparison of various\nspike sorting sub-techniques applied to real extracellularly recorded data from\na rat brain basolateral amygdala. An efficient sorted data resulted from\ncareful choice of spike sorting sub-methods leads to better interpretation of\nthe brain structures connectivity under different conditions, which is a very\nsensitive concept in diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. Here,\nspike detection is performed by appropriate choice of threshold level via three\ndifferent approaches. Feature extraction is done through PCA and Kernel PCA\nmethods, which Kernel PCA outperforms. We have applied four different\nalgorithms for spike clustering including K-means, Fuzzy C-means, Bayesian and\nFuzzy maximum likelihood estimation. As one requirement of most clustering\nalgorithms, optimal number of clusters is achieved through validity indices for\neach method. Finally, the sorting results are evaluated using inter-spike\ninterval histograms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2019 00:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-01"}

Previous work primarily focused on how to generate\nadversarial examples closed to source images, by introducing pixel-level\nperturbations into the whole or specific part of images. In this paper, we\npropose an evasion attack on CNN classifiers in the context of License Plate\nRecognition (LPR), which adds predetermined perturbations to specific regions\nof license plate images, simulating some sort of naturally formed spots (such\nas sludge, etc.). Therefore, the problem is modeled as an optimization process\nsearching for optimal perturbation positions, which is different from previous\nwork that consider pixel values as decision variables. Notice that this is a\ncomplex nonlinear optimization problem, and we use a genetic-algorithm based\napproach to obtain optimal perturbation positions. In experiments, we use the\nproposed algorithm to generate various adversarial examples in the form of\nrectangle, circle, ellipse and spots cluster. Experimental results show that\nthese adversarial examples are almost ignored by human eyes, but can fool\nHyperLPR with high attack success rate over 93%. Therefore, we believe that\nthis kind of spot evasion attacks would pose a great threat to current LPR\nsystems, and needs to be investigated further by the security community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2019 05:34:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 02:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-02"}

Beyond the\ngeneration of novel samples, it is of special interest to exploit the ability\nof the GAN generator to model the natural image manifold and hence generate\ncredible changes when manipulating images. However, this line of work is\nconditioned by the quality of the reconstruction. Until now, only inversion to\nthe latent space has been considered, we propose to exploit the representation\nin intermediate layers of the generator, and we show that this leads to\nincreased capacity. In particular, we observe that the representation after the\nfirst dense layer, present in all state-of-the-art GAN models, is expressive\nenough to represent natural images with high visual fidelity. It is possible to\ninterpolate around these images obtaining a sequence of new plausible synthetic\nimages that cannot be generated from the latent space. Finally, as an example\nof potential applications that arise from this inversion mechanism, we show\npreliminary results in exploiting the learned representation in the attention\nmap of the generator to obtain an unsupervised segmentation of natural images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Oct 2019 22:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-14"}
