The unperturbed medium (bulk) is modeled by a\nhoneycomb Schroedinger operator, which is periodic with respect to the\ntriangular lattice, invariant under parity, P, and complex-conjugation, C. A\nhoneycomb operator has Dirac points: two dispersion surfaces touch conically at\nan energy level, $E_D$ [25,27]. Periodic perturbations which break P or C open\na gap in the essential spectrum about energy $E_D$. Such operators model an\ninsulator near energy $E_D$. Our edge operator is a small perturbation of the\nbulk and models a transition (via a domain wall) between distinct periodic, P\nor C breaking perturbations. The edge operator permits energy transport along\nthe line-defect. The associated energy channels are called edge states. They\nare time-harmonic solutions which are localized near and propagating along the\nline-defect. We completely characterize the edge state spectrum within the bulk\nspectral gap about $E_D$. At the center of our analysis is an expansion of the\nedge operator resolvent for energies near $E_D$. The leading term features the\nresolvent of an effective Dirac operator. Edge state eigenvalues are poles of\nthe resolvent, which bifurcate from the Dirac point. The corresponding\neigenstates have the multiscale structure identified in [23]. We extend earlier\nwork on zigzag-type edges [14] to all rational edges. We elucidate the role in\nedge state formation played by the type of symmetry-breaking and the\norientation of the edge.

To avoid measuring deformation, we propose a hydrodynamic bulge\ntest for characterizing the material properties of thick, pre-stressed elastic\nsheets via their fluid--structure interaction with a steady viscous fluid flow.\nSpecifically, the hydrodynamic bulge test relies on a pressure drop measurement\nacross a rectangular microchannel with a deformable top wall. We develop a\nmathematical model using first-order shear-deformation theory of plates with\nstretching, and the lubrication approximation for Newtonian fluid flow.\nSpecifically, a relationship is derived between the imposed flow rate and the\ntotal pressure drop. Then, this relationship is inverted numerically to yield\nestimates of the Young's modulus (given the Poisson ratio), if the pressure\ndrop is measured (given the steady flow rate). Direct numerical simulations of\ntwo-way-coupled fluid--structure interaction are carried out in ANSYS to\ndetermine the cross-sectional membrane deformation and the hydrodynamic\npressure distribution. Taking the simulations as ``ground truth,'' a\nhydrodynamic bulge test is performed using the simulation data to ascertain the\naccuracy and validity of the proposed methodology for estimating material\nproperties.

The transition to the underdoped solution is marked by a\ndiscontinuous increase in the spectral gap, and on further underdoping the\nspectral gap increases while the superconducting order parameter decreases. We\nconclude that this is due to the onset of the pseudogap in the underdoped\nregion, which contributes to the increasing spectral gap; this is further\nconsistent with the appearance of a pole in the normal component of the\nself-energy, in the antinodal region, in the underdoped solution.

In this paper, we aim to eliminate\nthe inductive bias imposed by the embedding space geometry.

Unlike previous attempts to attack this problem, our\nnew approach takes into account all fluctuations in different channels on equal\nfooting and is able to treat reasonable large lattice sizes up to 32x32. This\nis achieved by the following three-step procedure: (i) We transform the\noriginal problem to a new representation (dual fermions) in which all purely\nlocal correlation effects from the dynamical mean field theory are already\nconsidered in the bare propagator and bare interaction of the new problem. (ii)\nThe strong $1/(i\\nu)^2$ decay of the bare propagator allows us to integrate out\nall higher Matsubara frequencies besides the lowest using low order diagrams.\nThe new effective action depends only on the two lowest Matsubara frequencies\nwhich allows us to, (iii) apply the two-particle self-consistent parquet\nformalism, which takes into account the competition between different\nlow-energy bosonic modes in an unbiased way, on much finer momentum grids than\nusual. In this way, we were able to map out the phase diagram of the 2D Hubbard\nmodel as a function of temperature and doping.

Partial interference occurs when\nindividuals can be partitioned into groups such that interference occurs only\nwithin groups. In the absence of interference, inverse probability weighted\n(IPW) estimators are commonly used to draw inference about causal effects of an\nexposure or treatment.

Motivated by a cholera vaccine study in Bangladesh, this paper\nconsiders an extension of the Tchetgen Tchetgen and VanderWeele IPW estimator\nto the setting where the outcome is subject to right censoring using inverse\nprobability of censoring weights (IPCW). Censoring weights are estimated using\nproportional hazards frailty models. The large sample properties of the IPCW\nestimators are derived, and simulation studies are presented demonstrating the\nestimators' performance in finite samples. The methods are then used to analyze\ndata from the cholera vaccine study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 16:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

A natural third question is to obtain a tighter\nlower bound that need not vanish as $n \\to \\infty$, i.e. over\ninfinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.\n  In this note, we affirmatively answer all three questions by extending and\nrefining Vybiral's result to lower-bound $M \\circ N$, for arbitrary complex\npositive semidefinite matrices $M, N$.

Existing approaches for DST mainly fall into one of two categories,\nnamely, ontology-based and ontology-free methods. An ontology-based method\nselects a value from a candidate-value list for each target slot, while an\nontology-free method extracts spans from dialog contexts. Recent work\nintroduced a BERT-based model to strike a balance between the two methods by\npre-defining categorical and non-categorical slots. However, it is not clear\nenough which slots are better handled by either of the two slot types, and the\nway to use the pre-trained model has not been well investigated. In this paper,\nwe propose a simple yet effective dual-strategy model for DST, by adapting a\nsingle BERT-style reading comprehension model to jointly handle both the\ncategorical and non-categorical slots.

Our method sets the new state of the art in the noisy\nsetting, while performing more robustly than the best model in the cleaner\nsetting.

The gas pressure is 0.2-0.4\ndyn/cm}^{2} in the first part and around 0.15 dyn/cm}^{2} in the latter part.\nThe more dynamic nature of the first part is characterised by the line-of-sight\nvelocities with absolute values of 6-7 km/s and microturbulent velocities of\n8-9 km/s. On the other hand, the latter part exhibits line-of-sight velocities\nwith absolute values 0-2.5 km/s and microturbulent velocities of 4-6 km/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 18:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

We find that the physics of feedback\noperating on large galactic scales depends very sensitively on plasma physics\noperating on small scales. Specifically, we demonstrate that: (i) in the purely\nhydrodynamical case, the AGN jets initially maintain the atmospheres in global\nthermal balance. However, local thermal instability generically leads to the\nformation of massive cold disks in the vicinity of the central black hole in\ndisagreement with observations; (ii) including weak magnetic fields prevents\nthe formation of the disks because local B-field amplification in the\nprecipitating cold gas leads to strong magnetic breaking, which quickly\nextracts angular momentum from the accreting clouds. The magnetic fields\ntransform the cold clouds into narrow filaments that do not fall ballistically;\n(iii) when plasma composition in the AGN jets is dominated by CRs, and CR\ntransport is neglected, the atmospheres exhibit cooling catastrophes due to\ninefficient heat transfer from the AGN to CGM despite Coulomb/hadronic CR\nlosses being present; (iv) including CR streaming and heating restores\nagreement with the observations, i.e., cooling catastrophes are prevented and\nmassive cold central disks do not form.

By doing that,\nhowever, it is critical that the target KPI (key performance indicators) of all\nservices are met. To this end, we study the VNF sharing problem and make\ndecisions on (i) when sharing VNFs among multiple services is possible, (ii)\nhow to adapt the virtual machines running the shared VNFs to the combined load\nof the assigned services, and (iii) how to prioritize the services traffic\nwithin shared VNFs. All decisions aim to minimize the cost for the mobile\noperator, subject to requirements on end-to-end service performance, e.g.,\ntotal delay.

We then propose the FlexShare\nalgorithm to provide near-optimal VNF-sharing and priority assignment decisions\nin polynomial time.

In particular, unnecessarily\nincluding an expensive feature in a model is worse than unnecessarily including\na cheap feature. We propose a procedure, which we call cheap knockoffs, for\nperforming feature selection in a cost-conscious manner. The key idea behind\nour method is to force higher cost features to compete with more knockoffs than\ncheaper features. We derive an upper bound on the weighted false discovery\nproportion associated with this procedure, which corresponds to the fraction of\nthe feature cost that is wasted on unimportant features. We prove that this\nbound holds simultaneously with high probability over a path of selected\nvariable sets of increasing size. A user may thus select a set of features\nbased, for example, on the overall budget, while knowing that no more than a\nparticular fraction of feature cost is wasted.

In\nthe current work, we present ConvoSource, a novel method based on a deep\nlearning technique, to identify the positions of radio sources, and compare the\nresults to a Gaussian-fitting method. Since the deep learning approach allows\nthe generation of more training images, it should perform well in the\nsource-finding task.

Understanding human\nbehavior is a cornerstone of observational practice, especially in\npsychotherapy. An important cue of behavior analysis is the dynamical changes\nof emotions during the conversation. Domain experts integrate emotional\ninformation in a highly nonlinear manner, thus, it is challenging to explicitly\nquantify the relationship between emotions and behaviors. In this work, we\nemploy deep transfer learning to analyze their inferential capacity and\ncontextual importance. We first train a network to quantify emotions from\nacoustic signals and then use information from the emotion recognition network\nas features for behavior recognition. We treat this emotion-related information\nas behavioral primitives and further train higher level layers towards behavior\nquantification. Through our analysis, we find that emotion-related information\nis an important cue for behavior recognition. Further, we investigate the\nimportance of emotional-context in the expression of behavior by constraining\n(or not) the neural networks' contextual view of the data. This demonstrates\nthat the sequence of emotions is critical in behavior expression. To achieve\nthese frameworks we employ hybrid architectures of convolutional networks and\nrecurrent networks to extract emotion-related behavior primitives and\nfacilitate automatic behavior recognition from speech.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 18:55:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-10"}

In this work, we propose a new framework customized for ecological\nbipartite network link prediction. Our approach starts with incorporating the\nPoisson N-mixture model, a widely used framework in statistical ecology for\nmodeling imperfect detection of a single species in field sampling. Despite its\nextensive use for single species analysis, this model has never been considered\nfor link prediction between different species, perhaps because of the complex\nnature of both link prediction and N-mixture model inference.

We\nconduct a systematic analysis of the effects of perturbation Reynolds number\n($Re_p$) and Atwood number ($A$) on RTI's late-time growth. Contrary to the\ncommon belief that single-mode RTI reaches a terminal bubble velocity, we show\nthat the bubble re-accelerates when $Re_p$ is sufficiently large, consistent\nwith [Ramaparabhu et al. 2006, Wei and Livescu 2012]. However, unlike in\n[Ramaparabhu et al. 2006], we find that for a sufficiently high $Re_p$, the\nbubble's late-time acceleration is persistent and does not vanish. Analysis of\nvorticity dynamics shows a clear correlation between vortices inside the bubble\nand re-acceleration. Due to symmetry around the bubble and spike (vertical)\naxes, the self-propagation velocity of vortices points in the vertical\ndirection. If viscosity is sufficiently small, the vortices persist long enough\nto enter the bubble tip and accelerate the bubble [Wei and Livescu 2012]. A\nsimilar effect has also been observed in ablative RTI [Betti and Sanz 2006]. As\nthe spike growth increases relative to that of the bubble at higher $A$,\nvorticity production shifts downward, away from the centerline and toward the\nspike tip. We modify the Betti-Sanz model for bubble velocity by introducing a\nvorticity efficiency factor $\\eta=0.45$ to accurately account for\nre-acceleration caused by vorticity in the bubble tip. It had been previously\nsuggested that vorticity generation and the associated bubble re-acceleration\nare suppressed at high $A$. However, we present evidence that if the large\n$Re_p$ limit is taken first, bubble re-acceleration is still possible. Our\nresults also show that re-acceleration is much easier to occur in 3D than 2D,\nrequiring smaller $Re_p$ thresholds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 19:56:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

However,\nits application to glaucoma has been limited to the computation of a few\nrelated biomarkers such as the vertical cup-to-disc ratio. Deep learning\napproaches, although widely applied for medical image analysis, have not been\nextensively used for glaucoma assessment due to the limited size of the\navailable data sets. Furthermore, the lack of a standardize benchmark strategy\nmakes difficult to compare existing methods in a uniform way. In order to\novercome these issues we set up the Retinal Fundus Glaucoma Challenge, REFUGE\n(\\url{https://refuge.grand-challenge.org}), held in conjunction with MICCAI\n2018. The challenge consisted of two primary tasks, namely optic disc/cup\nsegmentation and glaucoma classification. As part of REFUGE, we have publicly\nreleased a data set of 1200 fundus images with ground truth segmentations and\nclinical glaucoma labels, currently the largest existing one. We have also\nbuilt an evaluation framework to ease and ensure fairness in the comparison of\ndifferent models, encouraging the development of novel techniques in the field.\n12 teams qualified and participated in the online challenge. This paper\nsummarizes their methods and analyzes their corresponding results. In\nparticular, we observed that two of the top-ranked teams outperformed two human\nexperts in the glaucoma classification task. Furthermore, the segmentation\nresults were in general consistent with the ground truth annotations, with\ncomplementary outcomes that can be further exploited by ensembling the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 20:20:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-10"}

A hierarchy of approximations for this model includes a linear\napproximation for weak electrostatic potentials, finite size of the mobile\nelectrolyte ions and a Stern-layer correction. Recasting the Poisson-Boltzmann\nequations into Euler-Lagrange equations then significantly simplifies the\nderivation of the free energy of solvation for these approximate models. The\nparameters of the model are then either fit directly to experimental\nobservables, e.g. the finite ion size, or optimized for agreement with\nexperimental results. Experimental data for this optimization is available in\nthe form of Sechenov coefficients that describe the linear dependence of the\nsalting-out effect of solutes with respect to the electrolyte concentration.

This code\nis designed so that the most common errors move the state into an error space\northogonal to the original code space while preserving the information in the\nstate.

Higher-level controller design and\nstability analysis of such high-order systems are usually intractable and\ncomputation-costly. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a\nlarge-signal order reduction (LSOR) method for MGs with considerations of\nexternal control inputs and the detailed dynamics of underlying control levels\nbased on singular perturbation theory (SPT). Specially, we innovatively\nproposed and strictly proved a general stability and accuracy assessment\ntheorem that allows us to analyze the dynamic stability of a full-order\nnonlinear system by only leveraging its corresponding reduced-order model (ROM)\nand boundary layer model (BLM). Moreover, this theorem also theoretically\nprovides a set of conditions under which the developed ROM is accurate.\nFinally, by embedding such a theorem into the SPT, we propose a novel LSOR\napproach with guaranteed accuracy and stability analysis equivalence. The\nproposed LSOR method is generic and can be applied to arbitrary dynamic\nsystems. Multiple case studies are conducted on MG systems to show the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 20:55:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 02:17:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 00:50:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 23:46:40 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 22:36:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

Inverse planning eases GK planning by solving an optimization problem.\nHowever, due to the vast search space, most inverse planning algorithms have to\ndecouple the planning process to isocenter preselection and sector duration\noptimization. This sequential scheme does not necessarily lead to optimal\nisocenter locations and hence optimal plans. In this study, we attempt to\noptimize the isocenter positions, beam shapes and durations simultaneously by\nproposing a multi-resolution-level (MRL) strategy to handle the large-scale GK\noptimization problem. In our approach, several rounds of optimizations were\nperformed with a progressively increased spatial resolution for isocenter\ncandidate selection. The isocenters selected from last round and their\nneighbors on a finer resolution were used as new isocenter candidates for next\nround of optimization. After plan optimization, shot sequencing was performed\nto group the optimized sectors to deliverable shots supported by GK treatment\nunits. We have tested our algorithm on 6 GK cases previously treated in our\ninstitution (2 meningioma cases, 3 cases with single metastasis and 1 case with\n6 metastases).

To test this theory, we 1) model familiarity using\na language model estimated over a large training corpus and 2) run an\nexperiment applying several meaning preserving transformations to Java and\nPython expressions in a distinct test corpus to see if forms more familiar to\nreaders (as predicted by the language models) are in fact the ones actually\nwritten. We find that these transformations generally produce program\nstructures that are less common in practice, supporting the theory that the\nhigh repetitiveness in code is a matter of deliberate preference. Finally, 3)\nwe use a human subject study to show alignment between language model score and\nhuman preference for the first time in code, providing support for using this\nmeasure to improve code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 22:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-10"}

Updated measurements from several air-shower arrays with\nhigher precision lead to the discovery of new features in the energy spectrum:\nHAWC measures a softening of the light component (p+He) around $10^{13.5}\\,$eV;\nmeasurements of the Pierre Auger Observatory show that the second knee is a\nsmooth feature extending at least over the range of $100-200\\,$PeV and that the\nenergy spectrum between the ankle and the cut-off cannot be described by a\nsimple broken power law. Measurements of the mass composition confirm that the\ncomposition is a varying mixture of protons and nuclei at least up to several\n$10\\,$EeV. A joint effort of several collaborations helps to better assess\ndeficiencies of hadronic interaction models, e.g., by quantifying the muon\ndeficit in the models over the shower energy. Anisotropy measurements with\nhigher precision generally confirm earlier results. A change of the amplitude\nand phase of the equatorial dipole indicates that in the energy range between\nthe second knee and the ankle there likely is a transition from Galactic to\nextragalactic sources.

While these techniques have been very successful for parabolic\nequations, it has often been observed that their performance suffers\ndramatically when applied to advection-dominated problems or purely hyperbolic\nPDEs using standard rediscretization approaches on coarse grids. In this paper,\nwe apply MGRIT or Parareal to the constant-coefficient linear advection\nequation, appealing to existing convergence theory to provide insight into the\ntypically non-scalable or even divergent behavior of these solvers for this\nproblem. To overcome these failings, we replace rediscretization on coarse\ngrids with improved coarse-grid operators that are computed by applying\noptimization techniques to approximately minimize error estimates from the\nconvergence theory. One of our main findings is that, in order to obtain fast\nconvergence as for parabolic problems, coarse-grid operators should take into\naccount the behavior of the hyperbolic problem by tracking the characteristic\ncurves. Our approach is tested for schemes of various orders using explicit or\nimplicit Runge-Kutta methods combined with upwind-finite-difference spatial\ndiscretizations. In all cases, we obtain scalable convergence in just a handful\nof iterations, with parallel tests also showing significant speed-ups over\nsequential time-stepping.

Users\ncan develop their own apps or easily download and install them from\nvendor-specific app markets.

There exist both input model and simulation estimation\nuncertainties in the system performance estimates. Without strong prior\ninformation on the input models and the system mean response surface, in this\npaper, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric framework to quantify the impact\nfrom both sources of uncertainty. Specifically, since the real-world data often\nrepresent the variability caused by various latent sources of uncertainty,\nDirichlet Processes Mixtures (DPM) based nonparametric input models are\nintroduced to model a mixture of heterogeneous distributions, which can\nfaithfully capture the important features of real-world data, such as\nmulti-modality and skewness.

Thus, under very general conditions, our framework delivers an\nempirical credible interval accounting for both input and simulation\nuncertainties.

The\ndynamical model is a three-dimensional ODE system that is parameterized by the\npayoffs of the base game. Instead of routine searches for evolutionarily stable\nstrategies and sets, we expand our analysis to determining the asymptotic\nbehavior of solution trajectories starting from any initial state, and in\nparticular show that for the full range of payoffs, every trajectory of the\nsystem converges to an equilibrium point. The convergence results highlight\nthree findings that are of particular importance for understanding the\ncooperation mechanisms among self-interested agents playing repeated snowdrift\ngames. First, the inclusion of TFT- and STFT-players, the two types of\nconditional strategy players in the game, increases the share of cooperators of\nthe overall population compared to the situation when the population consists\nof only ALLC- and ALLD-players. This confirms findings in biology and sociology\nthat reciprocity may promote cooperation in social collective actions, such as\nreducing traffic jams and division of labor, where each individual may gain\nmore to play the opposite of what her opponent chooses. Second, surprisingly\nenough, regardless of the payoffs, there always exists a set of initial\nconditions under which ALLC players do not vanish in the long run, which does\nnot hold for all the other three types of players. So an ALLC-player, although\nperceived as the one that can be easily taken advantage of in snowdrift games,\nhas certain endurance in the long run.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 04:38:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-10"}

We further show that if the observations arrive in a\nrandom order, this barrier of $1/e$ can be broken using a static threshold\nalgorithm, and we show that our success probability is the best possible for\nany single-threshold algorithm under random observation order. Moreover, we\nprove that one can achieve a strictly better success probability using more\ngeneral multi-threshold algorithms, unlike the non-random-order case.

An outstanding problem of particular interest is\nto understand quantitatively the role of these regulation schemes in\nevolutionary dynamics. Typically, punishment usually occurs for enforcement of\nregulations. Taking into account both types of punishments to curve the\nregulations, we develop a game model where six evolutionary situations with\ncorresponding combinations of strategies are considered. Furthermore, a\nsemi-analytical method is developed to allow us to give an accurate estimations\nof the boundaries between the phases of full defection and nondefection.

We also uncover\nmonotonous facilitating effects of synergy effect, punishment fine and feedback\nsensitivity on the public cooperation for infinite well-mixed population.\nConversely, for networked population an optimal intermediate range of feedback\nsensitivity is needed to best promote punishers' populations. Overall,\nnetworked structure is overall more favorable for punishers and further for\npublic cooperation, because of both network reciprocity and mutualism between\npunishers and cooperators who do not punish defectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 07:30:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

Asteroids, comets, and planetary moons yield important\ninformation about the evolution of the Solar System. Additionally, they could\nprovide resources for a future space economy. While much research has gone into\nexploring asteroids and comets, dedicated spacecraft missions to planetary\nmoons are few and far between. There are three fundamental challenges of a\nspacecraft mission to the planetary moons: The first challenge is that the\nspheres of influence of most moons (except that of Earth) are small and, in\nmany cases, virtually absent. The second is that many moons are tidally locked\nto their planets, which means that an observer on the planet will have an\nentire hemisphere, which is always inaccessible. The third challenge is that at\na given time about half of the region will be in the Sun's shadow. Therefore, a\nsingle spacecraft mission to observe the planetary moon cannot provide complete\ncoverage. Such a complex task can be solved using a swarm approach, where the\nmapping task is delegated to multiple low-cost spacecraft. Clearly, the design\nof a swarm mission for such a dynamic environment is challenging. For this\nreason, we have proposed the Integrated Design Engineering & Automation of\nSwarms (IDEAS) software to perform automated end-to-end design of swarm\nmissions.

One important challenge with this\nspace-economy is ensuring the low-cost transport of raw materials from one\ngravity-well to another. The escape delta-v of 11.2 km/s from Earth makes this\nproposition very expensive. Transporting materials from the Moon takes 2.4 km/s\nand from Mars 5.0 km/s. Based on these factors, the Moon and Mars can become\ncolonies to export material into this space economy. One critical question is\nwhat are the resources required to sustain a space economy? Water has been\nidentified as a critical resource both to sustain human-life but also for use\nin propulsion, attitude-control, power, thermal storage and radiation\nprotection systems. Water may be obtained off-world through In-Situ Resource\nUtilization (ISRU) in the course of human or robotic space exploration. Based\nupon these important findings, we developed an energy model to determine the\nfeasibility of developing a mining base on Mars that mines and exports water\n(transports water on a Mars escape trajectory). Our designs for a mining base\nutilize renewable energy sources namely photovoltaics and solar-thermal\nconcentrators to provide power to construct the base, keep it operational and\nexport the water using a mass driver (electrodynamic railgun). Our studies\nfound the key to keeping the mining base simple and effective is to make it\nrobotic. Teams of robots (consisting of 100 infrastructure robots) would be\nused to construct the entire base using locally available resources and fully\noperate the base. This would decrease energy needs by 5-folds. Furthermore, the\nbase can be built 5-times faster using robotics and 3D printing. This shows\nthat automation and robotics is the key to making such a base technologically\nfeasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 08:04:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-10"}

Then, we propose two cryptographic protocols to realize a\nprivacy-preserving prediction computing stage, depending on whether or not an\nextra proxy is involved. Different from standard Top-k recommendations, we\nalternatively let the end user retrieve the unrated items whose predictions are\nabove a threshold, as a result of our privacy by design strategy. Experimental\nresults show that our new protocols are quite efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 08:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-10"}

Most of the existing methods either focus on how\nto learn view invariant feature or how to combine view-wise features. In this\npaper, we mainly focus on how to learn view-invariant features by getting rid\nof view specific information through a view confusion learning mechanism.\nSpecifically, we propose an end-toend trainable framework, called View\nConfusion Feature Learning (VCFL), for person Re-ID across cameras.

The proposed model is able to (1) reconstruct\nmissing sensory modalities, (2) predict the sensorimotor state of self and the\nvisual trajectories of other agents actions, and (3) control the agent to\nimitate an observed visual trajectory. Also, the proposed multimodal\nvariational autoencoder can capture the kinematic redundancy of the robot\nmotion through the learned probability distribution.

Hence, we conducted a legacy project\nwith the 45 m telescope of the Nobeyama Radio Observatory, called the CO\nMulti-line Imaging of Nearby Galaxies (COMING), which simultaneously observed\n147 galaxies with high far-infrared flux in $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O\n$J=1-0$ lines. The total molecular gas mass was derived using the standard\nCO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor and found to be positively correlated with the\ntotal stellar mass derived from the WISE $3.4 \\mu$m band data. The fraction of\nthe total molecular gas mass to the total stellar mass in galaxies does not\ndepend on their Hubble types nor the existence of a galactic bar, although when\ngalaxies in individual morphological types are investigated separately, the\nfraction seems to decrease with the total stellar mass in early-type galaxies\nand vice versa in late-type galaxies. No differences in the distribution of the\ntotal molecular gas mass, stellar mass, and the total molecular gas to stellar\nmass ratio was observed between barred and non-barred galaxies, which is likely\nthe result of our sample selection criteria, in that we prioritized observing\nFIR bright (and thus molecular gas-rich) galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 09:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-10"}

The mainstream edge learning approach, federated\nlearning, has been developed based on distributed gradient descent. Based on\nthe approach, stochastic gradients are computed at edge devices and then\ntransmitted to an edge server for updating a global AI model. Since each\nstochastic gradient is typically high-dimensional (with millions to billions of\ncoefficients), communication overhead becomes a bottleneck for edge learning.\nTo address this issue, we propose in this work a novel framework of\nhierarchical stochastic gradient quantization and study its effect on the\nlearning performance. First, the framework features a practical hierarchical\narchitecture for decomposing the stochastic gradient into its norm and\nnormalized block gradients, and efficiently quantizes them using a uniform\nquantizer and a low-dimensional codebook on a Grassmann manifold, respectively.\nSubsequently, the quantized normalized block gradients are scaled and cascaded\nto yield the quantized normalized stochastic gradient using a so-called hinge\nvector designed under the criterion of minimum distortion. The hinge vector is\nalso efficiently compressed using another low-dimensional Grassmannian\nquantizer. The other feature of the framework is a bit-allocation scheme for\nreducing the quantization error. The scheme determines the resolutions of the\nlow-dimensional quantizers in the proposed framework. The framework is proved\nto guarantee model convergency by analyzing the convergence rate as a function\nof the quantization bits. Furthermore, by simulation, our design is shown to\nsubstantially reduce the communication overhead compared with the\nstate-of-the-art signSGD scheme, while both achieve similar learning\naccuracies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 09:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

In practice, the potential is approximated with a neural\nnetwork and is called the discriminator. Duality constraints on the function\nclass of the discriminator are enforced approximately, and the expectations are\nestimated from samples.

Sakharov proposed that an explanation would\nrequire the violation of CP symmetry between matter and antimatter. The only CP\nviolation observed so far is in the weak interactions of quarks, and it is too\nsmall to explain the matter-antimatter imbalance of the universe. It has been\nshown that CP violation in the lepton sector could generate the\nmatter-antimatter disparity through the process called leptogenesis. The\nquantum mixing of neutrinos, the neutral leptons in the Standard Model,\nprovides a potential source of CP violation through a complex phase dCP, which\nmay have consequences for theoretical models of leptogenesis. This CP violation\ncan be measured in muon neutrino to electron neutrino oscillations and the\ncorresponding antineutrino oscillations, which are experimentally accessible\nwith accelerator-produced beams as established by the T2K experiment. Until\nnow, the value of dCP has not been significantly constrained by neutrino\noscillation experiments. Here the T2K collaboration reports a measurement that\nfavors large enhancement of the neutrino oscillation probability, excluding\nvalues of dCP which result in a large enhancement of the observed anti-neutrino\noscillation probability at three standard deviations (3 sigma). The 3 sigma\nconfidence level interval for dCP, which is cyclic and repeats every 2pi, is\n[-3.41,-0.03] for the so-called normal mass ordering, and [-2.54,-0.32] for the\ninverted mass ordering. Our results show an indication of CP violation in the\nlepton sector. Herein we establish methods for sensitive searches for\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry in neutrino oscillations using accelerator-produced\nneutrino beams. Future measurements with larger data samples will determine\nwhether the leptonic CP violation is larger than the quark sector CP violation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 10:32:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 08:47:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 13:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

A particular\npuzzle that requires explanation arises from one of the key results of the\nKepler mission, namely the increase in the planetary occurrence rate with\norbital period up to 10 days for F, G, K and M stars. We investigate the\nconditions for planet formation and migration near the dust sublimation front\nin protostellar disks around young Sun-like stars. For this analysis we use\niterative 2D radiation hydrostatic disk models which include irradiation by the\nstar, and dust sublimation and deposition depending on the local temperature\nand vapor pressure. We perform a parameter study by varying the magnetized\nturbulence onset temperature, the accretion stress, the dust mass fraction, and\nthe mass accretion rate. Our models feature a gas-only inner disk, a silicate\nsublimation front and dust rim starting at around 0.08 au, an ionization\ntransition zone with a corresponding density jump, and a pressure maximum which\nacts as a pebble trap at around 0.12 au. Migration torque maps show Earth- and\nsuper-Earth-mass planets halt in our model disks at orbital periods ranging\nfrom 10 to 22 days. Such periods are in good agreement with both the inferred\nlocation of the innermost planets in multiplanetary systems, and the break in\nplanet occurrence rates from the Kepler sample at 10 days. In particular,\nmodels with small grains depleted produce a trap located at a 10-day orbital\nperiod, while models with a higher abundance of small grains present a trap at\naround a 17-day orbital period. The snow line lies at 1.6 au, near where the\noccurrence rate of the giant planets peaks. We conclude that the dust\nsublimation zone is crucial for forming close-in planets, especially when\nconsidering tightly packed super-Earth systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 11:21:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

The\nquantum spin-Hall effect of light was introduced for surface plane-waves which\nintrinsically carry transverse optical spin, leading to many intriguing\nphenomena and applications in unidirectional waveguiding, metrology and quantum\ntechnologies. In addition to spin, optical waves can exhibit complex\ntopological properties of vectorial electromagnetic fields, associated with\norbital angular momentum or nonuniform intensity variations. Here, by\nconsidering both spin and angular momentum, we demonstrate a generalized\nspin-momentum relationship that governs vectorial properties of guided\nelectromagnetic waves, extending optical quantum spin-Hall effect to a\ntwo-dimensional vector field of structured guided wave. The effect results in\nthe appearance of the out-of-plane transverse optical spins, which vary\nprogressively from the 'up' state to the 'down' state around the energy flow,\nand their variation is uniquely locked to the energy propagation direction.

A maximum margin criterion with two levels of high\ndimensional mappings to kernel space is used to obtain better cross-view\ndiscrimination of the identities.

The ever-growing map prevents long-term mapping. In this\npaper, we developed a compact cognitive mapping approach inspired by\nneurobiological experiments. Inspired from neighborhood cells, neighborhood\nfields determined by movement information, i.e. translation and rotation, are\nproposed to describe one of distinct segments of the explored environment. The\nvertices and edges with movement information below the threshold of the\nneighborhood fields are avoided adding to the cognitive map. The optimization\nof the cognitive map is formulated as a robust non-linear least squares\nproblem, which can be efficiently solved by the fast open linear solvers as a\ngeneral problem. According to the cognitive decision-making of familiar\nenvironments, loop closure edges are clustered depending on time intervals, and\nthen parallel computing is applied to perform batch global optimization of the\ncognitive map for ensuring the efficiency of computation and real-time\nperformance. After the loop closure process, scene integration is performed, in\nwhich revisited vertices are removed subsequently to further reduce the size of\nthe cognitive map. A monocular visual SLAM system is developed to test our\napproach in a rat-like maze environment. Our results suggest that the method\nlargely restricts the growth of the size of the cognitive map over time, and\nmeanwhile, the compact cognitive map correctly represents the overall layer of\nthe environment as the standard one. Experiments demonstrate that our method is\nvery suited for compact cognitive mapping to support long-term robot mapping.\nOur approach is simple, but pragmatic and efficient for achieving the compact\ncognitive map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 11:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-10"}

While numerical approaches (using replicator\ndynamics) are dime a dozen, analytical approaches are rare. A particularly\nuseful analytical approach is to utilize a mapping between the spin-1/2 Ising\nmodel in 1-D and the social dilemma game and calculate the magnetization, which\nis the net difference between the fraction of cooperators and defectors in a\nsocial dilemma. In this paper, we look at the susceptibility, which probes the\nnet change in the fraction of players adopting a certain strategy, for both\nclassical and quantum social dilemmas. The reason being, in statistical\nmechanics problems, the thermodynamic susceptibility as compared to\nmagnetization is a more sensitive probe for microscopic behavior, e.g.,\nobserving small changes in a population adopting a certain strategy. In this\npaper, we find the thermodynamic susceptibility for reward, sucker's payoff and\ntemptation in classical Prisoner's Dilemma to be positive, implying that the\nturnover from defect to cooperate is greater than vice-versa, although the Nash\nEquilibrium for the two-player game is to defect. In classical Hawk-Dove game,\nthe thermodynamic susceptibility for resource suggests that the number of\nplayers switching to Hawk from Dove strategy is dominant. Entanglement in\nQuantum Prisoner's Dilemma (QPD) has a non-trivial role in determining the\nbehavior of thermodynamic susceptibility. At maximal entanglement, we find that\nsucker's payoff and temptation increase the number of players switching to\ndefect. In the zero-temperature limit, we find that there are two second-order\nphase transitions in the game, marked by a divergence in the susceptibility.\nThis behavior is similar to that seen in Type-II superconductors wherein also\ntwo second-order phase transitions are seen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 12:34:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 19:45:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-10"}

We expand upon a series of prior results which showed that (1)\nthe abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) is intrinsically universal (IU) [FOCS\n2012], and (2) the class of directed aTAM systems is not IU [FOCS 2016]. IU for\na model (or class of systems within a model) means that there is a universal\ntile set which can be used to simulate an arbitrary system within that model\n(or class). Furthermore, the simulation must not only produce the same\nresultant structures, it must also maintain the full dynamics of the systems\nbeing simulated modulo only a scale factor. While the FOCS 2012 result showed\nthe standard, two-dimensional (2D) aTAM is IU, here we show this is also the\ncase for the 3D version. Conversely, the FOCS 2016 result showed the class of\naTAM systems which are directed (a.k.a. deterministic, or confluent) is not IU,\nimplying that nondeterminism is fundamentally required for such simulations.\nHere, however, we show that in 3D the class of directed aTAM systems is\nactually IU, i.e. there is a universal directed simulator for them. We then\nconsider the influence of more rigid notions of dimensionality. Namely, we\nintroduce the Planar aTAM, where tiles are not only restricted to binding in\nthe plane, but also to traveling in the plane, and prove that the Planar aTAM\nis not IU, and that the class of directed systems within the Planar aTAM also\nis not IU. Finally, analogous to the Planar aTAM, we introduce the Spatial\naTAM, its 3D counterpart, and prove that it is IU.\n  To prove our positive results we have not only designed, but also implemented\nwhat we believe to be the first IU tile set ever implemented and simulated in\nany tile assembly model.

A subtlety and key for this method to work\ncorrectly is knowing whether the coefficients of these equations are\nidentifiable.\n  In this paper, to address this, we prove identifiability of the coefficients\nof input-output equations for types of differential models that often appear in\npractice, such as linear models with one output and linear compartment models\nin which, from each compartment, one can reach either a leak or an input. This\nshows that checking identifiability via input-output equations for these models\nis legitimate and, as we prove, that the field of identifiable functions is\ngenerated by the coefficients of the input-output equations. Finally, we\nexploit a connection between input-output equations and the transfer function\nmatrix to show that, for a linear compartment model with an input and strongly\nconnected graph, the field of all identifiable functions is generated by the\ncoefficients of the transfer function matrix even if the initial conditions are\ngeneric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 12:53:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Jul 2020 20:54:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 17:28:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2021 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 17:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-28"}

Earlier\nstudies have shown that disk stars at the inner resonances can transfer a\nsignificant amount of angular momentum to the dark matter halo and this results\nin the slow down of the bar pattern speed. In this paper we investigate how the\nmass of the other spheroidal component, the bulge, affects bar pattern speeds.\nIn our galaxy models the initial bars are all rotating fast as the R parameter,\nwhich is the ratio of the corotation radius to bar radius is less than 1.4,\nwhich is typical of fast bars. However, as the galaxies evolve with time, the\nbar pattern speed (${\\Omega}_p$ ) slows down leading to R $>$1.4 for all the\nmodels except for the model with the most massive bulge, in which the bar\nformed late and did not have time to evolve. The rapid slowdown of ${\\Omega}_p$\nis due to the larger angular momentum transfer from the disk to the bulge, and\nis due to interactions between stars at the inner resonances and those in the\nbar. Hence we conclude that the decrease in ${\\Omega}_p$ clearly depends on\nbulge mass in barred galaxies and decreases faster for galaxies with more\nmassive bulges. We discuss the implications of our results for observations of\nbar pattern speeds in galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 13:10:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In order to optimize the SQUID design, we combine inductance\nsimulations and measurements to extract the different inductance contributions,\nand measure the dependence of the transfer function $V_{\\Phi}$ and flux noise\n$S_\\Phi^{1/2}$ on $L$. A comparison between two samples shows that the kinetic\ninductance contribution varies strongly with film quality, hence making\ninductance measurements a crucial part of the SQUID characterization. Thanks to\nthe improved estimation of the kinetic inductance contribution, previously\nfound discrepancies between theoretical estimates and measured values of\n$V_{\\Phi}$ and $S_\\Phi^{1/2}$ could to a large extent be avoided.

It is\nextremely difficult to devise such basis functions for partitions consisting of\narbitrarily shaped polytopes. We propose the mollified basis functions of\narbitrary order and smoothness for partitions consisting of convex polytopes.\nOn each polytope an independent local polynomial approximant of arbitrary order\nis assumed. The basis functions are defined as the convolutions of the local\napproximants with a mollifier. The mollifier is chosen to be smooth, to have a\ncompact support and a unit volume. The approximation properties of the obtained\nbasis functions are governed by the local polynomial approximation order and\nmollifier smoothness. The convolution integrals are evaluated numerically first\nby computing the boolean intersection between the mollifier and the polytope\nand then applying the divergence theorem to reduce the dimension of the\nintegrals. The support of a basis function is given as the Minkowski sum of the\nrespective polytope and the mollifier. The breakpoints of the basis functions,\ni.e. locations with non-infinite smoothness, are not necessarily aligned with\npolytope boundaries. Furthermore, the basis functions are not boundary\ninterpolating so that we apply boundary conditions with the non-symmetric\nNitsche method as in immersed/embedded finite elements.

Instead, the most popular methods determine the interaction\nparameters iteratively, while assuming that individual interactions are\nuncorrelated.

The\nmitigation of the impact of residual ions is one of these measures. It is\nparticularly important if high bunch charges in combination with high\nrepetition rates are aimed for. This is because ions can be trapped in the\nstrong negative electrical potential of the electron beam causing emittance\nblow-up, increased beam halo and longitudinal and transverse instabilities.\n  Over the last decades three ion-clearing strategies have been applied to\ncounteract the degrading impact of the ions on the electron beam. These\nstrategies are installation of clearing electrodes, introduction of gaps in\nfilling pattern and beam shaking. Currently, their merit as clearing strategies\nfor the next generation of high brightness accelerators such as energy recovery\nlinacs (ERLs) are under intensive investigations by means of numerical and\nexperimental studies. Of particular interest in this context is the performance\nof multi-purpose electrodes, which are designed such that they allow for a\nsimultaneous ion-clearing and beam-position monitoring.

To illustrate the efficacy of the presented confidence sets, we\npresent C-UCRL, as a natural modification of UCRL2 for RL in undiscounted MDPs.\nIn the case of a known equivalence structure, we show that C-UCRL improves over\nUCRL2 in terms of regret by a factor of $\\sqrt{SA/C}$, in any communicating MDP\nwith $S$ states, $A$ actions, and $C$ classes, which corresponds to a massive\nimprovement when $C \\ll SA$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nwork providing regret bounds for RL when an equivalence structure in the MDP is\nefficiently exploited. In the case of an unknown equivalence structure, we show\nthrough numerical experiments that C-UCRL combined with ApproxEquivalence\noutperforms UCRL2 in ergodic MDPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 15:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-10"}

Although VANET connectivity has been\nintensively studied and investigated under no-fading channel models for their\nsimplicity, these models do not represent real-world scenarios that suffer\nchannel impairments. The connectivity probability in a multipath propagation\nenvironment is too challenging to be caught by a closed formula due to the\nemerging complexity associated with the randomness in a fading channel. This\nleads to contradicting statements about the impact of fading on VANET\nconnectivity. In this paper, we numerically estimate the connectivity\nprobability using graph-based Monte-Carlo simulations aiming for better\nunderstanding of the connectivity in fading channels.
