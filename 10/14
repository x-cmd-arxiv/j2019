For massive star winds dominated\nby electron scattering opacity in the optical and NIR, we can compute synthetic\nlight curves from simply knowing the magnetosphere's mass density distribution.\nWe exploit the newly-developed Analytical Dynamical Magnetosphere model (ADM)\nin order to obtain the predicted circumstellar density structures of magnetic\nO-type stars.

One remaining challenge\nconsists in the correction of phase and amplitude aberrations induced during\npropagation through complex layers. Unlike conventional line-per-line imaging,\nultrafast ultrasound provides for each transmission, backscattering information\nfrom the whole imaged area. Here, we take benefit from this feature and propose\nan efficient approach to perform fast aberration correction based on the\nSingular Value Decomposition of an ultrafast compound matrix built from\nbackscattered data for several plane wave transmissions. First, we explain the\nphysical signification of SVD and associated singular vectors within the\nultrafast matrix formalism. We theoretically demonstrate that the spatial and\nangular variables separation, rendered by SVD on ultrafast data, provides an\nelegant and straightforward way to optimize angular coherence of backscattered\ndata. In heterogeneous media with an aberrating phase screen approximation, we\ndemonstrate that the first spatial and angular singular vectors retrieve on one\nside the non-aberrated image, and on the other, the phase and amplitude of the\naberration law. In vitro results prove the efficiency of the image correction,\nbut also the accuracy of the aberrator determination. Based on spatial and\nangular coherence, we introduce a complete methodology for adaptive beamforming\nof ultrafast data, performed on successive isoplanatism patches undergoing SVD\nbeamforming. The simplicity of this method paves the way to real-time adaptive\nultrafast ultrasound imaging and provides a theoretical framework for future\nquantitative ultrasound applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 2019 17:39:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

How is this precision gain impacted by\nfactors such as the proportion of pipeline participants (those who enrolled but\nhaven't yet had their primary outcomes measured) and treatment effect\nheterogeneity? What is the resulting impact on power and average sample size in\na group sequential design? We derive an asymptotic formula that decomposes the\noverall precision gain from adjusting for baseline variables and a short-term\noutcome into contributions from factors mentioned above, for efficient\nestimators in the model that only assumes randomization and independent\ncensoring. We use our formula to approximate the precision gain from a targeted\nminimum loss-based estimator applied to data from a completed trial of a new\nsurgical intervention for stroke.

The WISH algorithm reduces the intractable discrete\nintegration problem into n optimization queries subject to randomized\nconstraints, obtaining a constant approximation guarantee. The optimization\nqueries are expensive, which limits the applicability of WISH. We propose\nAdaWISH, which is able to obtain the same guarantee but accesses only a small\nsubset of queries of WISH. For example, when the number of function values is\nbounded by a constant, AdaWISH issues only O(log n) queries. The key idea is to\nquery adaptively, taking advantage of the shape of the weight function being\nintegrated. In general, we prove that AdaWISH has a regret of only O(log n)\nrelative to an idealistic oracle that issues queries at data-dependent optimal\npoints.

We consider\ntwo different modes of operation, namely slow-time beam acquisition and\nfast-time instantaneous channel estimation, for training stage of time division\nduplex based systems. In the first mode, where pre-structured hybrid beams are\nformed to scan intended angular sectors, the joint angle-delay sparsity map\ntogether with power intensities of each user channels are obtained by using a\nnovel constant false alarm rate thresholding algorithm inspired from adaptive\nradar detection theory.

Using the\nAtacama Large Millimeter Array we put observational constraints on the physical\nlocation of COMs in a high-mass protostellar envelope associated with the\nG328.2551-0.5321 clump. The protostar is single down to ~400au scales and we\nresolve the emission region of COMs. Using thermodynamic equilibrium modelling\nof the available 7.5 GHz bandwidth around ~345 GHz, we detect emission from 10\nCOMs, and identify a line of deuterated water (HDO). The most extended emission\noriginates from methanol, methyl formate and formamide. Together with HDO,\nthese molecules are found to be associated with both the accretion shocks and\nthe inner envelope, for which we estimate a moderate temperature of $T_{\\rm\nkin}\\sim$110 K. Our findings reveal a significant difference in the\ndistribution of COMs. O-bearing COMs, such as ethanol, acetone, and ethylene\nglycol are almost exclusively found and show a higher abundance towards the\naccretion shocks with $T_{\\rm kin}\\sim$180 K. Whereas N-bearing COMs with a CN\ngroup, such as vinyl and ethyl cyanide peak on the central position, thus the\nprotostar and the accretion disk. This is the first observational evidence for\na large column density of COMs seen towards accretion shocks at the centrifugal\nbarrier at the inner envelope. Since the molecular composition is dominated by\nthat of the accretion shocks and the radiatively heated hot inner region is\nvery compact, we propose this source to be a precursor to a classical,\nradiatively heated hot core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 2019 21:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

Bug triaging, or assigning bugs to the owner(s) who will resolve\nthem, is a critical component of this process because there are many incorrect\nassignments that waste developer time and reduce bug resolution throughput. In\nthis work, we explore the use of a novel two-output deep neural network\narchitecture (Dual DNN) for triaging a bug to both an individual team and\ndeveloper, simultaneously. Dual DNN leverages this simultaneous prediction by\nexploiting its own guess of the team classes to aid in developer assignment. A\nmulti-label classification approach is used for each of the two outputs to\nlearn from all interim owners, not just the last one who closed the bug. We\nmake use of a heuristic combination of the interim owners\n(owner-importance-weighted labeling) which is converted into a probability mass\nfunction (pmf). We employ a two-stage learning scheme, whereby the team portion\nof the model is trained first and then held static to train the team--developer\nand bug--developer relationships. The scheme employed to encode the\nteam--developer relationships is based on an organizational chart (org chart),\nwhich renders the model robust to organizational changes as it can adapt to\nrole changes within an organization. There is an observed average lift (with\nrespect to both team and developer assignment) of 13%-points in 11-fold\nincremental-learning cross-validation (IL-CV) accuracy for Dual DNN utilizing\nowner-weighted labels compared with the traditional multi-class classification\napproach.

However, the momentum\nconservation law imposes a fundamental restriction on the optical pressure to\nbe repulsive in paraxial fields. Although different approaches to get around\nthis restriction have been proposed, they are rather sophisticated and rely on\neither wavefront engineering or utilize active media. Herein, we revisit the\nissue of optical forces by their analytic continuation to the complex frequency\nplane and considering their behavior in transient. We show that the exponential\nexcitation at the complex frequency offers an intriguing ability to achieve a\npulling force for a passive resonator of any shape and composition even in the\nparaxial approximation, the remarkable effect which is not reduced to the\nFourier transform. The approach is linked to the virtual gain effect when an\nappropriate transient decay of the excitation signal makes it weaker than the\noutgoing signal that carries away greater energy and momentum flux density.

Although, the point estimator of the\ndesign is unbiased and efficient, an unbiased variance estimator does not\nexist. A common practice to solve this is to collapse or combine the two\nadjacent strata, but the attained estimator of variance is not design-unbiased,\nand the bias increases as the population means of the collapsed strata become\nmore variant. Therefore, the one PSU per stratum design with collapsed stratum\nvariance estimator might not be a good choice, and some statisticians prefer a\ndesign in which two PSUs per stratum are selected. In this paper, we first\ncompare a one PSU per stratum design to a two PSUs per stratum design. Then, we\npropose an empirical Bayes estimator for the variance of one PSU per stratum\ndesign, where it over-shrinks towards the prior mean. To protect against this,\nwe investigate the potential of a constrained empirical Bayes estimator.\nThrough a simulation study, we show that the empirical Bayes and constrained\nempirical Bayes estimators outperform the classical collapsed one in terms of\nempirical relative mean squared error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 2019 21:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

An example of these structures are ring channels that\nmaintain constant diameters over time and play key roles in processes such as\ncell division, development, and wound healing. The interactions of actin with\nmyosin can be challenging to investigate experimentally in living systems,\ngiven limitations in filament visualization \\textit{in vivo}. We therefore use\ncomplex agent-based models that simulate mechanical and chemical interactions\nof polymer proteins in cells. To understand how filaments organize into\nstructures, we propose a TDA method that assesses effective ring generation in\ndata consisting of simulated actin filament positions through time. We analyze\nthe topological structure of point clouds sampled along these actin filaments\nand propose an algorithm for connecting significant topological features in\ntime. We introduce visualization tools that allow the detection of dynamic ring\nstructure formation. This method provides a rigorous way to investigate how\nspecific interactions and parameters may impact the timing of filamentous\nnetwork organization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 2019 22:31:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 01:33:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

Presently, this is attributed to properties of the\ndivergence obtained under an optimal discriminator. This argument has a\nfundamental flaw: If we do not impose regularity of the discriminator, it can\nexploit visually imperceptible errors of the generator to always achieve the\nmaximal generator loss. In practice, gradient penalties are used to regularize\nthe discriminator. However, this needs a metric on the space of images that\ncaptures visual similarity. Such a metric is not known, which explains the\nlimited success of gradient penalties in stabilizing GANs. We argue that the\nperformance of GANs is instead due to the implicit competitive regularization\n(ICR) arising from the simultaneous optimization of generator and\ndiscriminator. ICR promotes solutions that look real to the discriminator and\nthus leverages its inductive biases to generate realistic images. We show that\nopponent-aware modelling of generator and discriminator, as present in\ncompetitive gradient descent (CGD), can significantly strengthen ICR and thus\nstabilize GAN training without explicit regularization. In our experiments, we\nuse an existing implementation of WGAN-GP and show that by training it with CGD\nwe can improve the inception score (IS) on CIFAR10 for a wide range of\nscenarios, without any hyperparameter tuning.

However, training deep neural\nnetworks is a challenging task. Many alternatives have been proposed in place\nof end-to-end back-propagation. Layer-wise training is one of them, which\ntrains a single layer at a time, rather than trains the whole layers\nsimultaneously. In this paper, we study a layer-wise training using a block\ncoordinate gradient descent (BCGD) for deep linear networks. We establish a\ngeneral convergence analysis of BCGD and found the optimal learning rate, which\nresults in the fastest decrease in the loss. More importantly, the optimal\nlearning rate can directly be applied in practice, as it does not require any\nprior knowledge. Thus, tuning the learning rate is not needed at all. Also, we\nidentify the effects of depth, width, and initialization in the training\nprocess. We show that when the orthogonal-like initialization is employed, the\nwidth of intermediate layers plays no role in gradient-based training, as long\nas the width is greater than or equal to both the input and output dimensions.\nWe show that under some conditions, the deeper the network is, the faster the\nconvergence is guaranteed. This implies that in an extreme case, the global\noptimum is achieved after updating each weight matrix only once. Besides, we\nfound that the use of deep networks could drastically accelerate convergence\nwhen it is compared to those of a depth 1 network, even when the computational\ncost is considered.

In this study, we derive the model from grid spatial\nfrequencies represented by Gaussian profiles to a 1D place field by Bayesian\ninference, and further provide completely theoretical explanations for\nexpansion of place fields and predictions for alignments of grid components.

The existing methods form transformation model based on global\ncues, which however ignores the local cues that are verified in this paper to\nbe very important for the transformation. This paper proposes a new\ntransformation module based on local cues, where the relationship of the local\nfeatures is used for transformation.

For example, a doctor compares pairs\nof patients based on the level of severity of their illnesses, and the desired\nfactor is a quantitive level of the disease severity. In a real-world\napplication, the pairwise comparisons are usually noisy. Our method, Robust\nOrdinal VAE (ROVAE), incorporates the noisy pairwise ordinal comparisons in the\ndisentanglement task. We introduce non-negative random variables in ROVAE, such\nthat it can automatically determine whether each pairwise ordinal comparison is\ntrustworthy and ignore the noisy comparisons.

However, in real-world scenarios, different\nindividuals often hold distinct preferences. It might be misleading to merely\nlook at a global partial ranking while ignoring personal diversity. In this\npaper, instead of learning a global ranking which is agreed with the consensus,\nwe pursue the tie-aware partial ranking from an individualized perspective.\nParticularly, we formulate a unified framework which not only can be used for\nindividualized partial ranking prediction, but also be helpful for abnormal\nuser selection. This is realized by a variable splitting-based algorithm called\n\\ilbi. Specifically, our algorithm generates a sequence of estimations with a\nregularization path, where both the hyperparameters and model parameters are\nupdated. At each step of the path, the parameters can be decomposed into three\northogonal parts, namely, abnormal signals, personalized signals and random\nnoise. The abnormal signals can serve the purpose of abnormal user selection,\nwhile the abnormal signals and personalized signals together are mainly\nresponsible for individual partial ranking prediction.

SoS imaging using conventional ultrasound (US) systems would\nbe convenient and easy for clinical translation, but this requires using\nconventional US probes with single-sides tissue access and thus pulse-echo\nimaging sequences.

The power\nspectral density of pulsar timing red noise is usually modeled with a power law\nor a power law with a turnover frequency below which the noise power spectrum\nplateaus. If there is a turnover in the spin noise of millisecond pulsars,\nresiding within the observation band of current and/or future pulsar timing\nmeasurements, it may be easier than projected to resolve the gravitational-wave\nbackground from supermassive binary black holes.

On a fully-connected lattice with a large number of sites,\nthe mean-field geometry leads to a negative binomial law for the number of\nparticles at each site, with parameters depending on the hopping, creation and\nannihilation rates. This model can be mapped to population dynamics (if the\ncreation rates are reproductive fitnesses in a haploid population, and the\nhopping rate is the mutation rate). It can also be mapped to a\nBianconi--Barab\\'asi model of a growing network with random rewiring of links\n(if creation rates are the rates of acquisition of links by nodes, and the\nhopping rate is the rewiring rate).

In addition to the particle\nphysics motivations, these particles can also play a major role in cosmology by\ncontributing to dark matter abundance and affecting the structure formation at\nsub-Mpc scales. In this paper, we propose to use the 21cm forest observations\nto probe the nature of ultra-light dark matter. The 21cm forest can probe much\nsmaller scales than the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest, that is, $k\\gtrsim\n10\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We explore the range of the ultra-light dark matter mass\n$m_{u}$ and $f_u$, the fraction of ultra-light dark matter with respect to the\ntotal matter, which can be probed by the 21cm forest. We find that 21cm forest\ncan potentially put the dark matter mass lower bound $m_u \\gtrsim 10^{-18}$ eV\nfor $f_u=1$, which is 3 orders of magnitude bigger mass scale than those probed\nby the current Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest observations.While the effects of the\nultra-light particles on the structure formation become smaller when the\ndominant component of dark matter is composed of the conventional cold dark\nmatter, we find that the 21cm forest is still powerful enough to probe the\nsub-component ultra-light dark matter mass up to the order of $10^{-19}$ eV.\nThe Fisher matrix analysis shows that $(m_u,f_u)\\sim (10^{-20}\\mathrm{eV},\n0.3)$ is the most optimal parameter set which the 21cm forest can probe with\nthe minimal errors for a sub-component ultra-light dark matter scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 09:45:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 06:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

Here, we theoretically\nstudy interactions between IXs in stacked DQW bilayers, where the dipolar\ncoupling can be either attractive or repulsive depending on the relative\npositions of the particles. By using microscopic band structure calculations to\ndetermine the electronic states forming the excitons, we show that the\nattractive dipolar interaction between stacked IXs deforms their electronic\nwave function, thereby increasing the inter-DQW interaction energy and making\nthe IX electrically polarizable. Many-particle effects interaction are\naddressed by considering the coupling between a single IX in one of the DQWs to\na cloud of IXs in the other DQW, which is modeled either as a closed-packed\nlattice or as a continuum IX fluid. We find that the lattice model yields IX\ninterlayer binding energies decreasing with increasing lattice density. This\nbehavior is due to the dominating role of the intra-DQW dipolar repulsion,\nwhich prevents more than one exciton from entering the attractive region of the\ninter-DQW coupling. Finally, both models shows that the single IX distorts the\ndistribution of IXs in the adjacent DQW, thus inducing the formation of an IX\npolaron.

We fit the pseudo-bolometric LC with\nsemi-analytical models powered by radioactive decay and CSM interaction.\nFinally, we modeled the line profiles and emissivity of the prominent He I\nlines, in order to study the formation of P-Cygni profiles and estimate CSM\nproperties. Results: SN 2018bcc had a rise time to peak of $5.6^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$\ndays in the restframe with a rising shape power-law index close to 2, and seems\nto be a typical rapidly evolving Type Ibn SN.

An alternative solution\nis to learn from datasets of real image parsing, while the domain adaptation is\nan inevitable problem. Unlike existing methods that utilize the edge maps of\nreal images to approximate freehand sketches, the proposed homogeneous\ntransformation method transforms the data from domains of real images and\nfreehand sketches into a homogeneous space to minimize the semantic gap.\nSecond, we design a soft-weighted loss function as guidance for the training\nprocess, which gives attention to both the ambiguous label boundary and class\nimbalance.

Observations of the carbon content inside of the inner\nsublimation rim could confirm how much carbon remains locked in kilometer size\nbodies in the disk. Using near-infrared spectra, I self-consistently determine\nthe stellar, extinction, veiling, and accretion properties of the 26 stars in\nmy sample.

Three of the five modeled disks show\nrobust carbon depletion <=42 relative to the solar value. I discuss multiple\nways in which the `missing' carbon could be locked out of the accreting gas.\nGiven the high-density inner disk gas, evidence for radial drift, and lack of\nobvious gaps in these three systems, their carbon depletion is most consistent\nwith the `missing' carbon being sequestered in kilometer size bodies. For DR\nTau, nitrogen and silicon are also depleted by factors of 45 and 4,\nrespectively, suggesting that the kilometer size bodies into which the grains\nare locked were formed beyond the N_2 snowline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 10:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Turbulent convection is thought\nto act as an effective viscosity in damping large-scale tidal flows, but there\nis a long-standing controversy over the efficiency of this mechanism when the\ntidal frequency exceeds the turnover frequency of the dominant convective\neddies. This high frequency regime is relevant for many applications, such as\nfor tides in stars hosting hot Jupiters.

When the forcing\nfrequency exceeds the dominant convective frequency, the effective viscosity\nscales inversely with the square of the tidal frequency. We also show that\nnegative effective viscosities are possible, particularly for high frequency\ntidal forcing, suggesting the surprising possibility of tidal anti-dissipation.\nThese results are supported by a complementary high frequency asymptotic\nanalysis that extends prior work by Ogilvie & Lesur.

A major\nchallenge in QG is to identify answer-relevant context words to finish the\ndeclarative-to-interrogative sentence transformation. Existing\nsequence-to-sequence neural models achieve this goal by proximity-based answer\nposition encoding under the intuition that neighboring words of answers are of\nhigh possibility to be answer-relevant.

However, traditional learning-based\nview synthesis mainly considers the image quality of each view of the light\nfield and neglects the quality of the refocused images.

To\nmeet the stringent delay requirements of URLLC, short packet transmission is\nadopted and taken into account for resource allocation algorithm design. The\nresource allocation is optimized for maximization of the weighted system sum\nthroughput subject to quality-of-service (QoS) constraints regarding the URLLC\nusers' number of transmitted bits, packet error probability, and delay. Despite\nthe non-convexity of the resulting optimization problem, the optimal solution\nis found via monotonic optimization.

To this end, multi-point\nconnectivity is a promising approach for ensuring the desired rate and\nreliability requirements. A robust beamformer design is proposed to improve the\ncommunication reliability by exploiting the spatial macro-diversity and a\npessimistic estimate of rates over potential link blockage combinations.\nSpecifically, we provide a blockage-aware algorithm for the weighted sum-rate\nmaximization (WSRM) problem with parallel beamformer processing across\ndistributed remote radio units (RRUs). Combinations of non-convex and coupled\nconstraints are handled via successive convex approximation (SCA) framework,\nwhich admits a closed-form solution for each SCA step, by solving a system of\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions. Unlike the conventional\ncoordinated multi-point (CoMP) schemes, the proposed blockage-aware beamformer\ndesign has, per-iteration, computational complexity in the order of RRU\nantennas instead of system-wide joint transmit antennas. This leads to a\npractical and computationally efficient implementation that is scalable to any\narbitrary multi-point configuration.

Time-frequency analysis of epicardial electrograms has been\ninvestigated to study atrial fibrillation. However, deeper understanding of\natrial fibrillation can be achieved if the spatial dimension can be\nincorporated. Unfortunately, the physical models describing the spatial\nrelations of atrial fibrillation signals are complex and non-linear; hence, the\nconventional signal processing techniques to study electrograms in the joint\nspace, time, and frequency domain are less suitable. In this study, we wish to\nput forward a radically different approach to analyze atrial fibrillation with\na higher-level model. This approach relies on graph signal processing to\nrepresent the spatial relations between epicardial electrograms and put forward\na graph-time spectral analysis for atrial fibrillation. To capture the\nfrequency content along both the time and graph domain, we proposed the joint\ngraph and short-time Fourier transform. The latter allows us to analyze the\nspatial variability of the electrogram temporal frequencies. With this\ntechnique, we have found that the spatial variation of the atrial electrograms\ndecreases during atrial fibrillation due to the reduction of the high temporal\nfrequencies of the atrial waves. The proposed analysis further confirms that\nthe ventricular activity is smoother over the atrial area compared with the\natrial activity. Besides using the proposed graph-time analysis to conduct a\nfirst study on atrial fibrillation, we applied it to the cancellation of\nventricular activity from atrial electrograms. Experimental results on\nsimulated and real data further corroborate the findings in this atrial\nfibrillation study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 13:43:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

Though promising results have been achieved on standard\npedestrians, the performance on heavily occluded pedestrians remains far from\nsatisfactory. The main culprits are intra-class occlusions involving other\npedestrians and inter-class occlusions caused by other objects, such as cars\nand bicycles. These result in a multitude of occlusion patterns. We propose an\napproach for occluded pedestrian detection with the following contributions.\nFirst, we introduce a novel mask-guided attention network that fits naturally\ninto popular pedestrian detection pipelines. Our attention network emphasizes\non visible pedestrian regions while suppressing the occluded ones by modulating\nfull body features. Second, we empirically demonstrate that coarse-level\nsegmentation annotations provide reasonable approximation to their dense\npixel-wise counterparts. Experiments are performed on CityPersons and Caltech\ndatasets. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on both datasets. Our\napproach obtains an absolute gain of 9.5% in log-average miss rate, compared to\nthe best reported results on the heavily occluded (HO) pedestrian set of\nCityPersons test set. Further, on the HO pedestrian set of Caltech dataset, our\nmethod achieves an absolute gain of 5.0% in log-average miss rate, compared to\nthe best reported results.

The first\nsequence is thought to result from the dredge-up of carbon from the core, while\nthe second could at least partially be made of descendants of Hot DQs. However,\nthe evolution of carbon-polluted white dwarfs below 6500 K remains unexplored,\nmainly due to the theoretical difficulties associated with modelling their\ndense atmospheres.

Combining, or even replacing,\nclassic design elements such as B-tree nodes with machine learning models has\nproven to give outstanding improvements in the space footprint and time\nefficiency of data systems. However, these novel approaches are based on\nheuristics, thus they lack any guarantees both in their time and space\nrequirements. We propose the Piecewise Geometric Model index (shortly,\nPGM-index), which achieves guaranteed I/O-optimality in query operations,\nlearns an optimal number of linear models, and its peculiar recursive\nconstruction makes it a purely learned data structure, rather than a hybrid of\ntraditional and learned indexes (such as RMI and FITing-tree). We show that the\nPGM-index improves the space of the FITing-tree by 63.3% and of the B-tree by\nmore than four orders of magnitude, while achieving their same or even better\nquery time efficiency. We complement this result by proposing three variants of\nthe PGM-index. First, we design a compressed PGM-index that further reduces its\nspace footprint by exploiting the repetitiveness at the level of the learned\nlinear models it is composed of. Second, we design a PGM-index that adapts\nitself to the distribution of the queries, thus resulting in the first known\ndistribution-aware learned index to date.

After considering the TPE corrections to\nthe experimental data sets of unpolarized differential cross section, we\nanalyze the TPE corrections to the separated cross sections\n$\\sigma_{\\textrm{L,T,LT,TT}}$. We find that the TPE corrections (at\n$Q^2=1$--$1.6$ GeV$^2$) to $\\sigma_{\\textrm{L}}$ are about from $-10\\%$ to\n$-30\\%$, to $\\sigma_{\\textrm{T}}$ are about $20\\%$, and to\n$\\sigma_{\\textrm{LT,TT}}$ are much larger.

Traditional automatic reference-based\nmetrics, such as BLEU, have shown correlations with human judgements of\nadequacy and fluency and have been paramount for the advancement of MT system\ndevelopment. Crowd-sourcing has popularised and enabled the scalability of\nmetrics based on human judgements, such as subjective direct assessments (DA)\nof adequacy, that are believed to be more reliable than reference-based\nautomatic metrics. Finally, task-based measurements, such as post-editing time,\nare expected to provide a more detailed evaluation of the usefulness of\ntranslations for a specific task. Therefore, while DA averages adequacy\njudgements to obtain an appraisal of (perceived) quality independently of the\ntask, and reference-based automatic metrics try to objectively estimate quality\nalso in a task-independent way, task-based metrics are measurements obtained\neither during or after performing a specific task. In this paper we argue that,\nalthough expensive, task-based measurements are the most reliable when\nestimating MT quality in a specific task; in our case, this task is\npost-editing. To that end, we report experiments on a dataset with\nnewly-collected post-editing indicators and show their usefulness when\nestimating post-editing effort. Our results show that task-based metrics\ncomparing machine-translated and post-edited versions are the best at tracking\npost-editing effort, as expected. These metrics are followed by DA, and then by\nmetrics comparing the machine-translated version and independent references. We\nsuggest that MT practitioners should be aware of these differences and\nacknowledge their implications when deciding how to evaluate MT for\npost-editing purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 15:20:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

By leveraging\nmassive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect radio-frequency (RF)\nsignals with adjustable phase shifts, IRS can achieve high passive beamforming\ngains, which are particularly appealing for improving the efficiency of\nRF-based wireless power transfer. Motivated by the above, we study in the paper\nan IRS-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)\nsystem.

However, this optimization problem is non-convex\nwith intricately coupled variables, for which the existing alternating\noptimization approach is shown to be inefficient as the number of QoS\nconstraints increases. To tackle this challenge, we first apply proper\ntransformations on the QoS constraints and then propose an efficient iterative\nalgorithm by applying the penalty-based method. Moreover, by exploiting the\nshort-range coverage of IRSs, we further propose a low-complexity algorithm by\noptimizing the phase shifts of all IRSs in parallel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 15:44:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 2019 14:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

The main hurdle with such emulations is\ndealing with server faults in the system. Several crash-tolerant register\nemulations in static systems require algorithms to replicate the value of the\nshared register onto a majority of servers. Majority correctness is necessary\nfor such emulations. Byzantine faults are considered to be the worst kind of\nfaults that can happen in any distributed system. Emulating a\nByzantine-tolerant register requires replicating the register value on to more\nthan two-thirds of the servers. Emulating a register in a dynamic system where\nservers and clients can enter and leave the system and be faulty is harder than\nin static systems. There are several crash-tolerant register emulations for\ndynamic systems. This paper presents the first emulation of a multi-reader\nmulti-writer atomic register in a system that can withstand nodes continually\nentering and leaving, imposes no upper bound on the system size and can\ntolerate Byzantine servers. The algorithm works as long as the number of\nservers entering and leaving during a fixed time interval is at most a constant\nfraction of the system size at the beginning of the interval, and as long as\nthe number of Byzantine servers in the system is at most f. Although our\nalgorithm requires that there be a constant known upper bound on the number of\nByzantine servers, this restriction is unavoidable, as we show that it is\nimpossible to emulate an atomic register if the system size and maximum number\nof servers that can be Byzantine in the system is unknown to the nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 2019 22:43:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

The source\nthat affects stray light uniformity is the inconsistency of the brightness of\nthe sky background, which comes from moonlight, bright star, and city lighting\npollution. During CCD reduction, the effect of background uniformity cannot be\neliminated by dividing the flat field. Star deletion method is used in\nreal-time stray light analysis.

Methods: The proposed convolutional neural network-based method\nmainly comprises two functional modules to perform automatic detection of bone\ncondition by analyzing the diagnostic CT image. The first functional module\naims to locate and segment the ROI of diagnostic CT image, called\nMark-Segmentation-Network (MS-Net).

The trained MS-Net can get\nthe mark image of inputted original CT image, thereby obtain the segmentation\nimage. The trained BCC-Net can obtain the probability value of normal bone\nmass, low bone mass, and osteoporosis by inputting the segmentation image. On\nthe basis of network results, the radiologists can provide preliminary\nqualitative diagnosis results of bone condition. Results: The proposed MS-Net\nhas an excellent segmentation precision on the shape preservation of different\nlumbar vertebra.

In the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology\nChallenge 2019, with the team named PKU_DLIB, our proposed model, in high\nefficiency, achieved utility score (0.321) in the full test set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 03:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

A central\naggregator updates a global model by collecting local updates from mobile\ndevices using their local training data to train the global model in each\niteration.

In the past few years, many efforts have been spent on\nexploring query-optimisation attacks to find adversarial examples of either\nblack-box or white-box DNN models, as well as the defending countermeasures\nagainst those attacks. In this work, we explore vulnerabilities of DNN models\nunder the umbrella of Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, which has not been\ninvestigated before. From the perspective of an MitM adversary, the\naforementioned adversarial example attacks are not viable anymore. First, such\nattacks must acquire the outputs from the models by multiple times before\nactually launching attacks, which is difficult for the MitM adversary in\npractice. Second, such attacks are one-off and cannot be directly generalised\nonto new data examples, which decreases the rate of return for the attacker. In\ncontrast, using generative models to craft adversarial examples on the fly can\nmitigate the drawbacks. However, the adversarial capability of the generative\nmodels, such as Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), has not been extensively\nstudied. Therefore, given a classifier, we investigate using a VAE decoder to\neither transform benign inputs to their adversarial counterparts or decode\noutputs from benign VAE encoders to be adversarial examples. The proposed\nmethod can endue more capability to MitM attackers. Based on our evaluation,\nthe proposed attack can achieve above 95% success rate on both MNIST and\nCIFAR10 datasets, which is better or comparable with state-of-the-art\nquery-optimisation attacks.

While they can be addressed by fine-tuning,\nthis is not practical for ML service providers (e.g., Google or Microsoft) who\noften receive customer models without training data. Specialized hardware for\nhandling activation outliers can enable low-precision neural networks, but at\nthe cost of nontrivial area overhead. We instead propose overwrite quantization\n(OverQ), a lightweight hardware technique that opportunistically increases\nbitwidth for activation outliers by overwriting nearby zeros. It has two major\nmodes of operation: range overwrite and precision overwrite. Range overwrite\nreallocates bits to increase the range of outliers, while precision overwrite\nreuses zeros to increase the precision of non-outlier values. Combining range\noverwrite with a simple cascading logic, we handle the vast majority of\noutliers to significantly improve model accuracy at low bitwidth. Our\nexperiments show that with modest cascading, we can consistently handle over\n90% of outliers and achieve +5% ImageNet Top-1 accuracy on a quantized\nResNet-50 at 4 bits. Our ASIC prototype shows OverQ can be implemented\nefficiently on top of existing weight-stationary systolic arrays with small\narea increases per processing element.

In particular, it can be used to compare those aspects of\nfield theories (e.g. of classical (Newtonian) mechanics, hydrodynamics,\nelectrodynamics, relativity theory, classical Yang-Mills theory and so on) that\nare described by such equations. Employing a geometric (jet space) approach, a\nsuitable notion of shared structure of two systems of PDEs is identified. It is\nproven that this shared structure can serve to transfer solutions from one\ntheory to another and a generalization of so-called B\\\"acklund transformations\nis derived that can be used to generate non-trivial solutions of some\nnon-linear PDEs. A procedure (based on formal integrability) is introduced with\nwhich one can explicitly compute the minimal consistency conditions that two\nsystems of PDEs need to fulfill in order to share structure under a given\ncorrespondence.

The dynamic overset grids are used to locally\nincrease the grid resolution near complex immersed bodies, which are handled\nusing a sharp interface immersed boundary method, undergoing large movements as\nwell as arbitrary relative motions. The new framework extends the previous\noverset-CURVIB method with fixed overset grids and a sequential grid assembly\nto moving overset grids with an efficient parallel grid assembly. In addition,\na new method for the interpolation of variables at the grid boundaries is\ndeveloped which can drastically decrease the execution time and increase the\nparallel efficiency of our framework compared to the previous strategy. The\nmoving/rotating overset grids are solved in a non-inertial frame of reference\nto avoid recalculating the curvilinear metrics of transformation while the\nbackground/stationary grids are solved in the inertial frame. The new framework\nis verified and validated against experimental data, and analytical/benchmark\nsolutions. In addition, the results of the overset grid are compared with\nresults over a similar single grid. The method is shown to be 2nd order\naccurate, decrease the computational cost relative to a single grid, and good\noverall parallel speedup. The grid assembly takes less than 7% of the total CPU\ntime even at the highest number of CPUs tested in this work.

Accordingly, the event\nhorizon is a fundamental holographic sphere in thermodynamic equilibrium with\nonly one exterior side: a noncompressible binary message that maximizes Shannon\nentropy. Therefore, the Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem and generalized\nStokes theorem do not hold for black holes. We introduce the concept of\ninertial potential and demonstrate its equivalence to the variational\npotential, which ensures that any inertial acceleration represents a\nnonequilibrium thermodynamic condition.

This information directs\ndissemination processes on the network, such as the spread of rumors, fake\nnews, or diseases. However, the current state-of-the-art methods for supervised\ngraph classification are designed mainly for static graphs and may not be able\nto capture temporal information. Hence, they are not powerful enough to\ndistinguish between graphs modeling different dissemination processes. To\naddress this, we introduce a framework to lift standard graph kernels to the\ntemporal domain. Specifically, we explore three different approaches and\ninvestigate the trade-offs between loss of temporal information and efficiency.\nMoreover, to handle large-scale graphs, we propose stochastic variants of our\nkernels with provable approximation guarantees. We evaluate our methods on a\nwide range of real-world social networks. Our methods beat static kernels by a\nlarge margin in terms of accuracy while still being scalable to large graphs\nand data sets. Hence, we confirm that taking temporal information into account\nis crucial for the successful classification of dissemination processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 06:19:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 09:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-23"}

With the\nscandal of Cambridge Analytica and Russian intervention behind the Brexit and\nthe 2016 presidential election, people have become aware of the political ads\non social media and have pressured congress to restrict political advertising\non social media. Following the related legislation, social media companies\nbegan disclosing their political ads archive for transparency during the summer\nof 2018 when the midterm election campaign was just beginning. This research\ncollects the data of the related political ads in the context of the U.S.\nmidterm elections since August to study the overall pattern of political ads on\nsocial media and uses sets of machine learning methods to conduct sentiment\nanalysis on these ads to classify the negative ads. A novel approach is applied\nthat uses AI image recognition to study the image data. Through data\nvisualization, this research shows that negative advertising is still the\nminority, Republican advertisers and third party organizations are more likely\nto engage in negative advertising than their counterparts. Based on ordinal\nregressions, this study finds that anger evoked information-seeking is one of\nthe main mechanisms causing negative ads to be more engaging and effective\nrather than the negative bias theory. Overall, this study provides a unique\nunderstanding of political advertising on social media by applying innovative\ndata science methods. Further studies can extend the findings, methods, and\ndatasets in this study, and several suggestions are given for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 15:43:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-14"}
