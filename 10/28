Turbulent fluctuations\ngenerate regions of a sheared magnetic field that become unstable to the\ntearing instability and reconnection, thus modifying turbulence at the\ncorresponding scales. In this contribution, we give a brief discussion of some\nrecent results on tearing-mediated magnetic turbulence. We illustrate the main\nideas of this rapidly developing field of study by concentrating on two\nimportant examples -- magnetohydrodynamic Alfv\\'en turbulence and small-scale\nkinetic-Alfv\\'en turbulence.

NVRAM systems today have an order of\nmagnitude more NVRAM than traditional memory (DRAM). NVRAM systems could\ntherefore potentially allow very large graph problems to be solved on a single\nmachine, at a modest cost. However, a significant challenge in achieving high\nperformance is in accounting for the fact that NVRAM writes can be much more\nexpensive than NVRAM reads.\n  In this paper, we propose an approach to parallel graph analytics using the\nParallel Semi-Asymmetric Model (PSAM), in which the graph is stored as a\nread-only data structure (in NVRAM), and the amount of mutable memory is kept\nproportional to the number of vertices. Similar to the popular semi-external\nand semi-streaming models for graph analytics, the PSAM approach assumes that\nthe vertices of the graph fit in a fast read-write memory (DRAM), but the edges\ndo not. In NVRAM systems, our approach eliminates writes to the NVRAM, among\nother benefits.\n  To experimentally study this new setting, we develop Sage, a parallel\nsemi-asymmetric graph engine with which we implement provably-efficient (and\noften work-optimal) PSAM algorithms for over a dozen fundamental graph\nproblems. We experimentally study Sage using a 48-core machine on the largest\npublicly-available real-world graph (the Hyperlink Web graph with over 3.5\nbillion vertices and 128 billion edges) equipped with Optane DC Persistent\nMemory, and show that Sage outperforms the fastest prior systems designed for\nNVRAM. Importantly, we also show that Sage nearly matches the fastest prior\nsystems running solely in DRAM, by effectively hiding the costs of repeatedly\naccessing NVRAM versus DRAM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2019 17:46:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 02:34:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

However, recent advancements have\nshown that use of an implicit representation of the linear system makes these\nmethods competitive with alternating least squares. We provide the first\nparallel implementation of a Gauss-Newton method for CP decomposition, which\niteratively solves linear least squares problems at each Gauss-Newton step. In\nparticular, we leverage a formulation that employs tensor contractions for\nimplicit matrix-vector products within the conjugate gradient method. The use\nof tensor contractions enables us to employ the Cyclops library for\ndistributed-memory tensor computations to parallelize the Gauss-Newton approach\nwith a high-level Python implementation. In addition, we propose a\nregularization scheme for Gauss-Newton method to improve convergence properties\nwithout any additional cost. We study the convergence of variants of the\nGauss-Newton method relative to ALS for finding exact CP decompositions as well\nas approximate decompositions of real-world tensors. We evaluate the\nperformance of sequential and parallel versions of both approaches, and study\nthe parallel scalability on the Stampede2 supercomputer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2019 19:43:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 00:24:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

Purpose:\nSince most of the studies employed enhanced two-neutron interactions to follow\nthe evolution of an artificially bound state into a continuum one, we examine\nseveral enhancement schemes that produce a bound dineutron as well. Methods: We\nstudy the four-neutron system by solving exact four-particle equations. By\nvarying the interaction enhancement factor we calculate two-dineutron\nscattering phase shifts and cross sections. Results: When the same enhancement\nfactor is used in all partial waves, a bound tetraneutron emerges together with\na strongly bound dineutron. Furthermore, such a 0+ tetraneutron evolves not\ninto a resonance but into a virtual state. Weak enhancement of S waves together\nwith strongly enhanced higher waves is needed for the emergence of the resonant\nstate. Anyhow the resonant behavior disappears well before reaching the\nphysical interaction strength. Conclusions: The interaction enhancement scheme\nusing the same factor for all waves, employed in several previous works, is\nmisleading for the search of 0+ resonance as only a virtual state can emerge.\nEvolution of a bound tetraneutron into a resonance via an intermediate virtual\nstate is possible with strong enhancement of higher two-neutron waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2019 19:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

At the heart of EHCP is the question \"on a given passing\nplay, did the quarterback throw the pass to the receiver who was most likely to\ncatch it?\" To answer this question, we first built a Bayesian non-parametric\ncatch probability model that automatically accounts for complex interactions\nbetween inputs like the receiver's speed and distances to the ball and nearest\ndefender. While building such a model is, in principle, straightforward, using\nit to reason about a hypothetical pass is challenging because many of the model\ninputs corresponding to a hypothetical are necessarily unobserved. To wit, it\nis impossible to observe how close an un-targeted receiver would be to his\nnearest defender had the pass been thrown to him instead of the receiver who\nwas actually targeted. To overcome this fundamental difficulty, we propose\nimputing the unobservable inputs and averaging our model predictions across\nthese imputations to derive EHCP. In this way, EHCP can track how the\ncompletion probability evolves for each receiver over the course of a play in a\nway that accounts for the uncertainty about missing inputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 2019 20:07:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

Although tools exist\nfor measuring memory usage during one particular execution of a parallel\nprogram, such tools cannot bound the worst-case memory usage over all possible\nparallel executions.\n  This paper introduces Cilkmem, a tool that analyzes the execution of a\ndeterministic Cilk program to determine its $p$-processor memory high-water\nmark (MHWM), which is the worst-case memory usage of the program over \\emph{all\npossible} $p$-processor executions. Cilkmem employs two new algorithms for\ncomputing the $p$-processor MHWM. The first algorithm calculates the exact\n$p$-processor MHWM in $O(T_1 \\cdot p)$ time, where $T_1$ is the total work of\nthe program. The second algorithm solves, in $O(T_1)$ time, the approximate\nthreshold problem, which asks, for a given memory threshold $M$, whether the\n$p$-processor MHWM exceeds $M/2$ or whether it is guaranteed to be less than\n$M$. Both algorithms are memory efficient, requiring $O(p \\cdot D)$ and $O(D)$\nspace, respectively, where $D$ is the maximum call-stack depth of the program's\nexecution on a single thread.\n  Our empirical studies show that Cilkmem generally exhibits low overheads.\nAcross ten application benchmarks from the Cilkbench suite, the exact algorithm\nincurs a geometric-mean multiplicative overhead of $1.54$ for $p=128$, whereas\nthe approximation-threshold algorithm incurs an overhead of $1.36$ independent\nof $p$.

There is no\ncounter-example for the conjecture among the over 3*10^{10} numerical\nsemigroups of genus up to 60, as it has been computationally verified by\nFromentin and Hivert. The computations use the idea of parsing a semigroups\ntree, making tests in each node. As a mean to combine parsing of the semigroups\ntree with known theoretical results, we introduce the concept of cutting\nsemigroup. Assume that there exists a property on numerical semigroups that\nimplies that a semigroup satisfying it necessarily satisfies Wilf's conjecture.\nAssume also that, besides, this property is hereditary, that is, if a semigroup\nsatisfies it, then all its descendants in the semigroups tree also have the\nsame property. Such properties exist. Interesting ones can be easily deduced\nfrom some deep results of Eliahou. A semigroup satisfying such a property is\ncalled a cutting semigroup (for that property). When looking for\ncounter-examples to Wilf's conjecture, if a cutting semigroup is found, then it\ncan be cut off, since no counter example lies among its descendants. One can\ntherefore consider the trimmed tree obtained by cutting off all the cutting\nsemigroups. Depending on the properties, these ideas allow in some cases to\navoid parsing a very significant part of the tree and can be applied to other\nrelated problems. For instance, they can be used to find all numerical\nsemigroups with negative Eliahou number up to a genus bigger than 60, which is\nthe current record.

However, a direct or near-direct bandgap at the heterointerface that\ncan significantly enhance optical generation, for high light absorbing\nfew/multi-layer vdW materials, has not yet been shown. In this work, for the\nfirst time, few-layer group-6 transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) $WSe_2$ is\nshown to form a sizeable (0.7 eV) near-direct bandgap with type-II band\nalignment at its interface with the group-7 TMD $ReS_2$ through density\nfunctional theory calculations. Further, the type-II alignment and\nphotogeneration across the interlayer bandgap have been experimentally\nconfirmed through micro-photoluminescence and IR photodetection measurements,\nrespectively. High optical absorption in few-layer flakes, large conduction and\nvalence band offsets for efficient electron-hole separation and stacking of\nlight facing, direct bandgap $ReS_2$ on top of gate tunable $WSe_2$ are shown\nto result in excellent and tunable photodetection as well as photovoltaic\nperformance through flake thickness dependent optoelectronic measurements.\nFew-layer flakes demonstrate ultrafast response time (5 $\\mu$s) at high\nresponsivity (3 A/W) and large photocurrent generation and responsivity\nenhancement at the heterostructure overlap region (10-100X) for 532 nm laser\nillumination. Large open-circuit voltage of 0.64 V and short-circuit current of\n2.6 $\\mu$A enables high output electrical power. Finally, long term\nair-stability and a facile single contact metal fabrication process makes the\nmulti-functional few-layer $WSe_2$/$ReS_2$ heterostructure diode\ntechnologically promising for next-generation optoelectronic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 00:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

To further\ninvestigate the efficacy of hybrid white dwarfs as progenitors of thermonuclear\nsupernovae, we performed simulations of thermonuclear supernovae from a new\nseries of hybrid progenitors that include the effects of mixing during cooling.\nThe progenitor white dwarf model was constructed with the one-dimensional\nstellar evolution code MESA and represented a star evolved through the phase of\nunstable interior mixing followed by accretion until it reached conditions for\nthe ignition of carbon burning. This MESA model was then mapped to a\ntwo-dimensional initial condition for explosions simulated with FLASH. For\ncomparison, similar simulations were performed for a traditional C-O progenitor\nwhite dwarf. By comparing the yields of the explosions, we find that, as with\nearlier studies, the lower C abundance in the hybrid progenitor compared to the\ntraditional C-O progenitor leads to a lower average yield of 56Ni. Although the\nunmixed hybrid WD showed a similar decrement also in total iron group yield,\nthe mixed case does not and produces a smaller fraction of iron group elements\nin the form of 56Ni. We attribute this to the higher central density required\nfor ignition and the location, center or off-center, of deflagration ignition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 01:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel and adaptive batch-wise regularization based\non the proposed Adaptive Confusion Energy (ACE) to flexibly address the nature\nworld distribution, which usually involves fine-grained and long-tailed\nproperties at the same time. ACE increases the difficulty of the training\nprocess and further alleviates the overfitting problem. Through the datasets\nwith the technical issue in fine-grained (CUB, CAR, AIR) and long-tailed\n(ImageNet-LT), or comprehensive issues (CUB-LT, iNaturalist), the result shows\nthat the ACE is not only competitive to some state-of-the-art on performance\nbut also demonstrates the effectiveness of training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 03:23:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 07:16:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 06:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-15"}

This method provides a useful inductive bias for\ncertain problems, but existing software for differentiable optimization layers\nis rigid and difficult to apply to new settings. In this paper, we propose an\napproach to differentiating through disciplined convex programs, a subclass of\nconvex optimization problems used by domain-specific languages (DSLs) for\nconvex optimization. We introduce disciplined parametrized programming, a\nsubset of disciplined convex programming, and we show that every disciplined\nparametrized program can be represented as the composition of an affine map\nfrom parameters to problem data, a solver, and an affine map from the solver's\nsolution to a solution of the original problem (a new form we refer to as\naffine-solver-affine form). We then demonstrate how to efficiently\ndifferentiate through each of these components, allowing for end-to-end\nanalytical differentiation through the entire convex program. We implement our\nmethodology in version 1.1 of CVXPY, a popular Python-embedded DSL for convex\noptimization, and additionally implement differentiable layers for disciplined\nconvex programs in PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0. Our implementation significantly\nlowers the barrier to using convex optimization problems in differentiable\nprograms. We present applications in linear machine learning models and in\nstochastic control, and we show that our layer is competitive (in execution\ntime) compared to specialized differentiable solvers from past work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 04:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

The use of user-generated\ncontent in this framework, as a partly-unbiased, real-time and low cost content\non the web distinguishes the proposed news website ranking framework from the\nliterature. The results obtained for three prominent news websites, BBC, CNN,\nNYTimes, show that BBC has the best performance in terms of news completeness\nand speed, and NYTimes has the best diversity in comparison with the other two\nwebsites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 04:50:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

In this\npaper, we introduce the first efficient regret minimization algorithm for\ncomputing extensive-form correlated equilibria in large two-player general-sum\ngames with no chance moves. Designing such an algorithm is significantly more\nchallenging than designing one for the Nash equilibrium counterpart, as the\nconstraints that define the space of correlation plans lack the hierarchical\nstructure and might even form cycles.

This structural decomposition is\nachieved via a special convexity-preserving operation that we coin scaled\nextension. We show that a regret minimizer can be designed for a scaled\nextension of any two convex sets, and that from the decomposition we then\nobtain a global regret minimizer.

Traditional direct\nestimates computed using only sampled data from individual subpopulations are\nusually unreliable due to small sample sizes. Subpopulations with small samples\nare termed small areas or small domains. To improve on the less reliable direct\nestimates, model-based estimates, which borrow information from suitable\nauxiliary variables, have been extensively proposed in the literature. However,\nstandard model-based estimates rely on the normality assumptions of the error\nterms. In this research we propose a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) method for the\nunit-level nested error regression model based on a normal mixture for the\nunit-level error distribution. To implement our proposal we use a uniform prior\nfor the regression parameters, random effects variance parameter, and the\nmixing proportion, and we use a partially proper non-informative prior\ndistribution for the two unit-level error variance components in the mixture.\nWe apply our method to two examples to predict summary characteristics of farm\nproducts at the small area level.

The other\nexample involves total cash associated in farm operations in twenty-seven\nfarming regions in Australia.

We\nused individualized neighbourhoods to examine associations between suicide\nmortality, social fragmentation, and deprivation for the total population as\nwell as by sex and age group. Methods: Using a nested case-control design, all\nsuicides aged 18-64 years between 2007 and 2016 were selected from longitudinal\nDutch register data and matched with 10 random controls. Indices for social\nfragmentation and deprivation were calculated annually for 300, 600, and 1,000\nmetre circular buffers around each subject's residential address. Results:\nSuicide mortality was significantly higher in neighbourhoods with high\ndeprivation and social fragmentation.

Suicide mortality remained significantly\nhigher for women living in highly fragmented neighbourhoods in the fully\nadjusted model.

Methods: A\npreviously optimized three-point sensor system was used for in vivo HDR\nbrachytherapy measurements (using the scintillators BCF-60, BCF-12, and\nBCF-10). The light detection system of the mPSD consisted of compactly\nassembled photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and dichroic mirrors and filters to\nachieve a highly sensitive scintillation light collection. The PMT signals were\nrecorded using a NI-DAQ board at a rate of 100 kHz. Dose measurements covering\na range of 0.5 to 10 cm from the 192Ir source were carried out according to\nTG-43 U1 recommendations in order to: (1) characterize the system's response in\nterms of angular dependence; (2) obtain the relative contribution of\npositioning and measurement uncertainties to the total system uncertainty; (3)\nassess the system's temporal resolution; and (4) track the source position in\nreal time. Results: The positioning uncertainty dominated close to the source,\nwhereas the measurement uncertainty dominated at larger distances. A maximum\nmeasurement uncertainty of 17 % was observed for the BCF-60 scintillator at 10\ncm from the source. The average best compromise between positioning and\nmeasurement uncertainties were reached at 17.4 mm. The detector further\nexhibited no angular dependence.

Therefore, we believe\nthat laminar phase mixing is not a viable stand-alone heating mechanism for\ncoronal loops. We show that $\\gamma$ is largest at resonance.

In\nparticular, quark transversity distributions in the nucleons have very\ndifferent properties from the longitudinally-polarized quark distribution\nfunctions, especially in scaling violation, because they are decoupled from the\ngluon transversity, due to the fact that they are helicity-flip (chiral-odd)\ndistributions. Such studies are valuable for finding not only the origin of the\nnucleon spin but also a signature on physics beyond the standard model, because\nthe electric dipole moment of the neutron is proportional to the transversity\ndistributions. Now, there is experimental progress on the quark transversity\ndistributions; however, there is no experimental information on gluon\ntransversity. In fact, the gluon transversity does not exist for the spin-1/2\nnucleon due to the helicity-conservation constraint. One needs a hadron with\nspin more than or equal to one, so that the helicity flip of two units is\nallowed. A stable spin-1 target is, for example, the deuteron for studying the\ngluon transversity.

Several model\nHamiltonians building on this interplay have been proposed and while these can\nyield spin-polarized transport properties that agrees with experimental\nobservations, they simultaneously depend on unrealistic values of the\nspin-orbit interaction parameters. It is likely, however, that a common deficit\noriginates from the fact that all these models are uncorrelated, or,\nsingle-electron theories. Therefore, chirality induced spin selectivity is,\nhere, addressed using a many-body approach, which allows for non-equilibrium\nconditions and a systematic treatment of the correlated state. The intrinsic\nmolecular spin-polarization increases by two orders of magnitudes, or more,\ncompared to the corresponding result in the uncorrelated model. In addition,\nthe electronic structure responds to varying external magnetic conditions\nwhich, therefore, enables comparisons of the currents provided for different\nspin-polarizations in one of the (or both) leads between which the molecule is\nmounted. Using experimentally feasible parameters and room temperature, the\nobtained normalized difference between such currents may be as large as 5 - 10\n% for short molecular chains, clearly suggesting the vital importance of\nincluding electron correlations when searching for explanations of the\nphenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 10:25:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

To address this, we present PerceptNet, a convolutional neural network\nwhere the architecture has been chosen to reflect the structure and various\nstages in the human visual system. We evaluate PerceptNet on various\ntraditional perception datasets and note strong performance on a number of them\nas compared with traditional image quality metrics. We also show that including\na nonlinearity inspired by the human visual system in classical deep neural\nnetworks architectures can increase their ability to judge perceptual\nsimilarity.

The main\nnovelty is to allow \"moderately discontinuous\" chains, which are specially\nadvantageous for capturing the subtleties of the outer metric phenomena. Our\ninvariant is a finitely generated graded abelian group $MDH^b_\\bullet$ for any\n$b\\in [1,\\infty]$ and homomorphisms $MDH^b_\\bullet\\to MDH^{b'}_\\bullet$ for any\n$b\\geq b'$.

The homology groups for the\ninner or outer metric are proved to be finitely generated and that only\nfinitely many homomorphisms $MDH^b_\\bullet\\to MDH^{b'}_\\bullet$ are essential.\nFor $b=1$ it recovers the homology of the tangent cone for the outer metric and\nof the Gromov tangent cone for the inner one. In general, for $b=\\infty$ the\n$MD$- homology recovers the homology of the punctured germ. Hence, our\ninvariant interpolates from the germ to its tangent cone. Our homology theory\nis a bi-Lipschitz subanalitic invariant, is invariant by suitable metric\nhomotopies, and satisfies versions of the relative and Mayer-Vietoris long\nexact sequences. Moreover, fixed a discontinuity rate $b$ we show that it is\nfunctorial for a class of discontinuous Lipschitz maps, whose discontinuities\nare $b$-moderated; this makes the theory quite flexible. In the complex\nanalytic setting we introduce an enhancement called Framed MD Homology, which\ntakes into account information from fundamental classes. As applications we\nprove that Moderately Discontinuous Homology characterizes smooth germs among\nall complex analytic germs, recovers the number of irreducible components of\ncomplex analytic germs and the embedded topological type of plane branches.\nFramed MD Homology recovers the topological type of any plane curve singularity\nand relative multiplicities of complex analytic germs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 10:57:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:04:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 17:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-23"}

In our model, we decouple character\nimages into style representation and content representation, which facilitates\nmore precise control of these two types of variables, thereby improving the\nquality of the generated results. We also introduce two modules, namely, font\nconsistency module (FCM) and content prior module (CPM). FCM exploits a\ncategory guided Kullback-Leibler loss to embedding the style representation\ninto different Gaussian distributions. It constrains the characters of the same\nfont in the training set globally. On the other hand, it enables our model to\nobtain style variables through sampling in testing phase. CPM provides content\nprior for the model to guide the content encoding process and alleviates the\nproblem of stroke deficiency during de-stylization. Extensive experimental\nresults on character stylization and de-stylization have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 12:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

In addition, significant discrepancies\nbetween nuclear models in the proton-rich territory call for quantified\npredictions. With the help of Bayesian methodology, we mix a family of nuclear\nmass models corrected with statistical emulators trained on the experimental\nmass measurements, in the proton-rich region of the nuclear chart.

When such strategies are able to fully mitigate reasonable doubt,\nwe can take a theory regarding the phenomena to be established by experiment.\nThere are good reasons to expect the next generation of analogue experiments to\nprovide genuine knowledge of unmanipulable and inaccessible phenomena such that\nthe relevant theories can be understood as well supported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 13:12:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 12:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

We determined the surface\nLi abundance for a sample of 829 giant stars with accurate Gaia parallaxes for\na large sub-sample (810 stars) complemented with accurate Hipparcos parallaxes\n(19 stars). The spectra of our sample of northern and southern giant stars were\nobtained in three ground-based observatories (OHP, ESO-La Silla, Mc Donald).

Rotation-induced mixing accounts nicely for the lithium behaviour\nin stars warmer than about 4200K, independently of the mass domain. For stars\nwith masses lower than 2Msun thermohaline mixing leads to further Li depletion\nbelow the Teff of the RGB bump (about 4000K), and on the early AGB, as\nobserved.

Results: The brightest emission\nregions were found to be correlated with populations of massive stars, notably\nin the 10 kpc star-forming ring.

The space-time evolution of these densities is\nobtained by solving a set of dislocation transport equations coupled with\ncrystal mechanics. Here, we present an approach for incorporating dislocation\nannihilation and junction reactions into the dislocation transport equations.\nThese reactions consume dislocations and result in nothing as in the\nannihilation reactions, or produce new dislocations of different types as in\nthe case of junction reactions. Collinear annihilation, glissile junctions, and\nsessile junctions are particularly emphasized here. A generalized energy-based\ncriterion for junction reactions is established in terms of the dislocation\ndensity and Burgers vectors of the reacting species, and the reaction rate\nterms for junction reactions are formulated in terms of the dislocation\ndensities. In order to illustrate how the dislocation network changes as a\nresult of junction formation and annihilation in a continuum dislocation\ndynamics setting, we present some numerical examples focusing on the reactions\nprocesses themselves. The results show that our modeling approach is able to\ncapture the respective dislocation network changes associated with dislocation\nreactions in FCC crystals: dislocations of opposite line directions\nencountering each other on collinear slip systems annihilate to connect the\ndislocations on the two slip systems, glissile junctions form on new slip\nsystem behave like Frank-Read sources, and sessile junctions form and expand\nalong the intersection of the slip planes of the reacting dislocation species.\nA collective-dynamics test showing the frequency of occurrence of junctions of\ndifferent types relative to each other is also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 15:46:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 17:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

We analyze the\nnetwork delay and the AoI in a multi-hop satellite network that relays status\nupdates from satellite 1, receiving uplink traffic from ground devices, to\nsatellite K, using K-2 intermediate satellite nodes. The last node, K, is the\nclosest satellite with connectivity to a ground station. The satellite\nformation is modeled as a queue network of M/M/1 systems connected in series.\nThe scenario is then generalized for the case in which all satellites receive\nuplink traffic from ground, and work at the same time as relays of the packets\nfrom the previous nodes. The results show that the minimum average AoI is\nexperienced at a decreasing system utilization when the number of nodes is\nincreased. Furthermore, unloading the first nodes of the chain reduces the\nqueueing time and therefore the average AoI.

MEDO is a theoretical framework for understanding these\nquestions in abstract terms, as well as for generating and evaluating specific\nhypotheses that seek to explain goal-oriented behavior. MEDO views preferences\nas selective pressures influencing the likelihood of particular outcomes.

Existing\nknowledge reveals that the energy cascade generally exists in transitional and\nturbulent flows with different distributions, and the characteristic quantity\nof scale interaction in energy cascade processes is energy flux. Therefore,\nenergy flux similarity is selected as the basic criterion to secure the flow\nfield getting from LES highly similar to the real flow field. Through a priori\ntests, we find that the energy flux from the tensor-diffusivity (TD) model has\nhigh similarity with the real energy flux. Then, we modify the modelled energy\nflux from the TD model and obtain uniform formulas of energy flux similarity\ncorresponding to different filter widths and locations in the wall-bounded\nturbulence. To secure the robustness of simulation and the LES results similar\nto the real flow, we apply the energy flux similarity method (EFSM) to the\nSmagorinsky model in the LES of compressible turbulent channel flow,\ncompressible flat-plate flow, and flow over a compressible ramp.

In multistage fractured\ncompletions, post-fracturing production analysis reveals that different stages\nproduce very non-uniformly due to a combination of geomechanics and fracturing\ndesign factors. Hence, there is a significant room for improvement of current\ndesign practices. The workflow is essentially split into two stages. As a\nresult of the first stage, the present paper summarizes the efforts into the\ncreation of a digital database of field data from several thousands of\nmultistage HF jobs on wells from circa 20 different oilfields in Western\nSiberia, Russia. In terms of the number of points (fracturing jobs), the\npresent database is a rare case of a representative dataset of about 5000 data\npoints. Each point in the data base contains the vector of 92 input variables\n(the reservoir, well and the frac design parameters) and the vector of\nproduction data, which is characterized by 16 parameters, including the target,\ncumulative oil production. Data preparation has been done using various ML\ntechniques: the problem of missing values in the database is solved with\ncollaborative filtering for data imputation; outliers are removed using\nvisualisation of cluster data structure by t-SNE algorithm. The production\nforecast problem is solved via CatBoost algorithm. Prediction capability of the\nmodel is measured with the coefficient of determination (R^2) and reached\n0.815.

The development of new antimicrobial treatments\nsuch as antimicrobial peptides needs to be accelerated to combat this threat.\nHowever, the discovery of novel antimicrobial peptides is hampered by\nlow-throughput biochemical assays. Computational techniques can be used for\nrapid screening of promising antimicrobial peptide candidates prior to testing\nin the wet lab. The vast majority of existing antimicrobial peptide predictors\nare non-targeted in nature, i.e., they can predict whether a given peptide\nsequence is antimicrobial, but they are unable to predict whether the sequence\ncan target a particular microbial species. In this work, we have developed a\ntargeted antimicrobial peptide activity predictor that can predict whether a\npeptide is effective against a given microbial species or not.
