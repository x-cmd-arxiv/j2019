In this work, we first demonstrate that, due\nto non-flow backgrounds, the flow measurements by the Q-cumulant method using\nall charged particles as reference introduce a trivial linear term to $\\Delta\nv_{2}(A_{\\rm ch})$. The trivial slope can be negative in the triangle flow\ndifference $\\Delta v_{3}(A_{\\rm ch})$ if the non-flow is dominated by\nback-to-back pairs. After eliminating the trivial term, we find that the\nnon-flow between like-sign pairs gives rise to an additional positive slope to\n$\\Delta v_{2}(A_{\\rm ch})$ because of the larger dilution effect to $\\pi^{+}$\n($\\pi^{-}$) at positive (negative) $A_{\\rm ch}$. We further find that the\ncompetition between different $\\pi$ sources can introduce another non-trivial\nlinear-$A_{\\rm ch}$ term due to their different multiplicity fluctuations and\nanisotropic flows. We then study the effect of neutral cluster (resonance)\ndecays as a mechanism for local charge conservation on the slope parameter of\n$\\Delta v_{2}(A_{\\rm ch})$. We find that the slope parameter is sensitive to\nthe kinematics of those neutral clusters. Light resonances give positive slopes\nwhile heavy resonances give negative slopes.

These gains attracted increasing interest in the last few\nyears. Prior work, however, has focused on extracting spatial channel\ncharacteristics at the sub-6GHz band first and then use them to reduce the\nmmWave beam training overhead. This approach has a number of limitations: (i)\nIt still requires a beam search at mmWave, (ii) its performance is sensitive to\nthe error associated with extracting the sub-6GHz channel characteristics, and\n(iii) it does not normally account for the different dielectric properties at\nthe different bands. In this paper, we first prove that under certain\nconditions, there exist mapping functions that can predict the optimal mmWave\nbeam and correct blockage status directly from the sub-6GHz channel, which\novercome the limitations in prior work. These mapping functions, however, are\nhard to characterize analytically which motivates exploiting deep neural\nnetwork models to learn them. For that, we prove that a large enough neural\nnetwork can use the sub-6GHz channel to directly predict the optimal mmWave\nbeam and the correct blockage status with success probabilities that can be\nmade arbitrarily close to one. Then, we develop an efficient deep learning\nmodel and empirically evaluate its beam/blockage prediction performance using\nthe publicly available dataset DeepMIMO. The results show that the proposed\nsolution can predict the mmWave blockages with more than 90$\\%$ success\nprobability.

Sensor with normal\ncone geometry exhibits response in ppm level with sensitivity of 13pF/ppm,\nlower detection limit(LOD)~120 ppm with excellent response/recovery time.\nLowering LOD further requires alteration of conical geometric parameters in\ntandem with kinetic theory of water vapour molecules.

We show that this leads to a stronger\nsuper-sample covariance than assumed in the literature and causes a substantial\nleakage of Gaussian information. We decompose the covariance matrix into\nseveral contributions that provide an insight into its behavior for different\nbiased tracers. We show that for realistic surveys, the covariance of power\nspectrum multipoles is already dominated by shot noise and super survey mode\ncoupling in the weakly non-linear regime. Both these effects can be accurately\nmodeled analytically, making a perturbative treatment of the covariance very\ncompelling.

The primary's longitudinal magnetic field $\\langle\nB_z \\rangle$ varies between about $+100$ and $-250$ G, suggesting a surface\nmagnetic dipole strength $B_{\\rm d} = 850$~G. Bayesian analysis of the Stokes\n$V$ profiles indicates $B_{\\rm d} = 650$~G for the primary and $B_{\\rm d} <\n110$ G for the secondary. The primary's line profiles are highly variable,\nconsistent with the hypothesis that the out-of-eclipse brightness modulation is\na consequence of rotational modulation of that star's chemical spots. We also\ndetect a residual signal in the light curve after removal of the orbital and\nrotational modulations, which might be pulsational in origin; this could be\nconsistent with the weak line profile variability of the secondary. This system\nrepresents an excellent opportunity to examine the consequences of magnetic\nfields for stellar structure via comparison of two stars that are essentially\nidentical with the exception that one is magnetic. The existence of such a\nsystem furthermore suggests that purely environmental explanations for the\norigin of fossil magnetic fields are incomplete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 17:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

To overcome\nthis issue, recent works on deformation modeling seek to spatially reconfigure\nthe data towards a common arrangement such that semantic recognition suffers\nless from deformation. This is typically done by augmenting static operators\nwith learned free-form sampling grids in the image space, dynamically tuned to\nthe data and task for adapting the receptive field. Yet adapting the receptive\nfield does not quite reach the actual goal -- what really matters to the\nnetwork is the \"effective\" receptive field (ERF), which reflects how much each\npixel contributes. It is thus natural to design other approaches to adapt the\nERF directly during runtime.\n  In this work, we instantiate one possible solution as Deformable Kernels\n(DKs), a family of novel and generic convolutional operators for handling\nobject deformations by directly adapting the ERF while leaving the receptive\nfield untouched. At the heart of our method is the ability to resample the\noriginal kernel space towards recovering the deformation of objects. This\napproach is justified with theoretical insights that the ERF is strictly\ndetermined by data sampling locations and kernel values. We implement DKs as\ngeneric drop-in replacements of rigid kernels and conduct a series of empirical\nstudies whose results conform with our theories. Over several tasks and\nstandard base models, our approach compares favorably against prior works that\nadapt during runtime.

I present a novel approach to compute the likelihood\nfunction for such data sets. This approach employs Gaussian copulas to decouple\nthe correlation structure of variables and their marginal distributions\nresulting in a flexible method to compute likelihood functions of data in the\npresence of measurement uncertainty, censoring, and missing data. I demonstrate\nits use by determining the slope and intrinsic scatter of the star forming\nsequence of nearby galaxies from observational data. The outlined algorithm is\nimplemented as the flexible, easy-to-use, open-source Python package LEO-Py.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

Using the Maximum-weighted Independent Set\n(MIS) problem in which there are flexible parameters (energy penalties J\nbetween pairs of edges) in an Ising formulation as the model problem, we\nconstruct examples to show that by changing the value of J, we can change the\nquantum evolution from one that has an anti-crossing (that results in an\nexponential small min-gap) to one that does not have, or the other way around,\nand thus drastically change (increase or decrease) the min-gap. However, we\nalso show that by changing the value of $J$ alone, one can not avoid the\nanti-crossing. We recall a polynomial reduction from an Ising problem to an MIS\nproblem to show that the flexibility of changing parameters without changing\nthe problem to be solved can be applied to any Ising problem. As an example, we\nshow that by such a reduction alone, it is possible to remove the anti-crossing\nand thus increase the min-gap. Our anti-crossing definition is necessarily\nscaling invariant as scaling the problem Hamiltonian does not change the nature\n(i.e. presence or absence) of an anti-crossing. As a side note, we show exactly\nhow the min-gap is scaled if we scale the problem Hamiltonian by a constant\nfactor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 18:12:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 22:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-30"}

This was confirmed\nin optical spectroscopy measurements. For photon energies between $\\sim 450$\nand 600 meV in SH$_3$, the reflectance in the superconducting state is below\nthat in its normal state. This difference decreases as $T$ approaches $T_c$.\nDecreasing absorption with increasing $T$ is opposite to what is expected in\nordinary metals. Such an anomalous behavior can be traced back to the energy\ndependence of the superconducting density of states which is highly peaked at\nthe energy gap value $\\Delta$ but decays back to the constant normal state\nvalue as energy is increased, on a scale of a few $\\Delta$, or by increasing\n$T$ towards $T=T_c$.

Should the energy of the phonon involved be very\nlarge, of order 200 meV or more, this process offers the possibility of\nobserving the closing of the superconducting order parameter with $T$ at\ncorrespondingly very large energies.

To enable\npractical quantum photonic devices, the emission rates of solid-state quantum\nemitters need to be substantially enhanced and the emitted signal must be\ndirectly coupled to an on-chip circuitry. The photon emission rate speed-up is\nbest achieved via coupling to plasmonic antennas, while on-chip integration can\nbe easily obtained by directly coupling emitters to photonic waveguides. The\nrealization of practical devices requires that both the emission speed-up and\nefficient out-couping are achieved in a single architecture. Here, we propose a\nnovel platform that effectively combines on-chip compatibility with high\nradiative emission rates, a quantum plasmonic launcher. The proposed launchers\ncontain single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds as quantum\nemitters that offer record-high average fluorescence lifetime shortening\nfactors of about 7000 times. Nanodiamonds with single NV are sandwiched between\ntwo silver films that couple more than half of the emission into in-plane\npropagating surface plasmon polaritons. This simple, compact, and scalable\narchitecture represents a crucial step towards the practical realization of\nhigh-speed on-chip quantum networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 18:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

Our map relies on remarkable connections\nbetween the relative momentum of the two-body problem, the classical limit of\nthe scattering amplitude and the deflection angle in hyperbolic motion. These\nrelationships allow us to compute observables for generic orbits (such as the\nperiastron advance $\\Delta\\Phi$) through analytic continuation, via a radial\naction depending only on boundary data. A simplified (more geometrical) map can\nbe obtained for circular orbits, enabling us to extract the orbital frequency\nas a function of the (conserved) binding energy, $\\Omega(E)$, directly from\nscattering information. As an example, using the results in Bern et al.\n[1901.04424, 1908.01493], we readily derive $\\Omega(E)$ and $\\Delta\\Phi(J,E)$\nto two-loop orders. We also provide closed-form expressions for the orbital\nfrequency and periastron advance at tree-level and one-loop order,\nrespectively, which capture a series of exact terms in the Post-Newtonian\nexpansion. We then perform a partial PM resummation, using a \"no-recoil\"\napproximation for the amplitude. This limit is behind the map between the\nscattering angle for a test-particle and the two-body dynamics to 2PM. We show\nthat it also captures a subset of higher order terms beyond the test-particle\nlimit. While a (rather lengthy) Hamiltonian may be derived as an intermediate\nstep, our map applies directly between gauge invariant quantities.

While DRAM latency has remained nearly the\nsame over many generations, DRAM bandwidth has grown significantly due to\nhigher frequencies, newer architectures (DDR4, LPDDR4, GDDR5) and 3D-stacked\nmemory packaging (HBM). Current state-of-the-art prefetchers do not do well in\nextracting higher performance when higher DRAM bandwidth is available.\nPrefetchers need the ability to dynamically adapt to available bandwidth,\nboosting prefetch count and prefetch coverage when headroom exists and\nthrottling down to achieve high accuracy when the bandwidth utilization is\nclose to peak.

DSPatch builds on a novel and intuitive use of\nmodulated spatial bit-patterns. The key idea is to: (1) represent program\naccesses on a physical page as a bit-pattern anchored to the first \"trigger\"\naccess, (2) learn two spatial access bit-patterns: one biased towards coverage\nand another biased towards accuracy, and (3) select one bit-pattern at run-time\nbased on the DRAM bandwidth utilization to generate prefetches.

Given the inevitability of unwanted physical\nnoise in quantum systems and the propensity for errors to spread as\ncomputations proceed, computational outcomes can become substantially\ncorrupted. This observation applies regardless of the choice of physical\nimplementation. In the context of photonic quantum information processing,\nthere has recently been much interest in passive linear optics quantum\ncomputing, which includes boson-sampling, as this model eliminates the\nhighly-challenging requirements for feed-forward via fast, active control. That\nis, these systems are passive by definition. In usual scenarios, error\ndetection and correction techniques are inherently active, making them\nincompatible with this model, arousing suspicion that physical error processes\nmay be an insurmountable obstacle. Here we explore a photonic error-detection\ntechnique, based on W-state encoding of photonic qubits, which is entirely\npassive, based on post-selection, and compatible with these near-term photonic\narchitectures of interest. We show that this W-state redundant encoding\ntechniques enables the suppression of dephasing noise on photonic qubits via\nsimple fan-out style operations, implemented by optical Fourier transform\nnetworks, which can be readily realised today. The protocol effectively maps\ndephasing noise into heralding failures, with zero failure probability in the\nideal no-noise limit.

Recently, Liu et al.

However, this method was not specifically\ntailored for designing energy-efficient networks, and is computationally\nexpensive on large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we substantially improve Liu\net al.

Our fast algorithm allows us to reduce the\ncomputational cost of splitting to the same level of typical back-propagation\nupdates and enables efficient implementation on GPU.

So far, most\nweak-lensing studies have focused on the shear field that can be measured\ndirectly from the ellipticity of background galaxies. However, within the\ncontext of forthcoming full-sky weak-lensing surveys such as Euclid,\nconvergence maps (mass maps) offer an important advantage over shear fields in\nterms of cosmological exploitation. While it carry the same information, the\nlensing signal is more compressed in the convergence maps than in the shear\nfield. This simplifies otherwise computationally expensive analyses, for\ninstance, non-Gaussianity studies. However, the inversion of the non-local\nshear field requires accurate control of systematic effects caused by holes in\nthe data field, field borders, shape noise, and the fact that the shear is not\na direct observable (reduced shear). We present the two mass-inversion methods\nthat are included in the official Euclid data-processing pipeline: the standard\nKaiser & Squires method (KS), and a new mass-inversion method (KS+) that aims\nto reduce the information loss during the mass inversion.

The results of the KS+ method are compared to the original\nimplementation of the KS method in its simplest form, using the Euclid Flagship\nmock galaxy catalogue.

However, the theory is mainly developed assuming that the model\nis stationary with time invariant parameters. This is at odds with the\nprevalent evidence for parameter instability in economic time series, but\ntheories for parameter instability are mainly developed for models with a small\nnumber of covariates. In this paper, we present two $L_2$ boosting algorithms\nfor estimating high dimensional models in which the coefficients are modeled as\nfunctions evolving smoothly over time and the predictors are locally\nstationary. The first method uses componentwise local constant estimators as\nbase learner, while the second relies on componentwise local linear estimators.\nWe establish consistency of both methods, and address the practical issues of\nchoosing the bandwidth for the base learners and the number of boosting\niterations. In an extensive application to macroeconomic forecasting with many\npotential predictors, we find that the benefits to modeling time variation are\nsubstantial and they increase with the forecast horizon. Furthermore, the\ntiming of the benefits suggests that the Great Moderation is associated with\nsubstantial instability in the conditional mean of various economic series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 21:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

As the atmosphere warms without additional water\nvapor input, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) increases as well. Increased\ntemperatures and accompanied elevated VPD levels can both lead to negative\nimpacts on crop yield. The independent importance of VPD, however, is often\nneglected or conflated with that from temperature due to a tight correlation\nbetween the two climate factors. We used a coupled process-based crop (MAIZSIM)\nand soil (2DSOIL) model to gain a mechanistic understanding of the independent\nroles temperature and VPD play in crop yield projections, as well as their\ninteractions with rising CO2 levels and changing precipitation patterns. We\nfound that by separating out the VPD effect from rising temperatures, VPD\nincreases had a greater negative impact on yield compared to that from warming.\nThe negative impact of these two factors varied with precipitation levels and\ninfluenced yield through separate mechanisms. Warmer temperatures caused yield\nloss mainly through shortening the growing season, while elevated VPD increased\nwater loss and triggered several water stress responses such as reduced\nphotosynthetic rates, lowered leaf area development, and shortened growing\nseason length. Elevated CO2 concentrations partially alleviated yield loss\nunder warming or increased VPD conditions through water savings, but the impact\nlevel varied with precipitation levels and was most pronounced under drier\nconditions. These results demonstrate the key role VPD plays in crop growth and\nyield, displaying a magnitude of impact comparative to temperature and CO2.

For example, Gaussian graphical models have recently been\nextended to the setting of multivariate functional data by applying\nmultivariate methods to the coefficients of truncated basis expansions.\nHowever, a key difficulty compared to multivariate data is that the covariance\noperator is compact, and thus not invertible. The methodology in this paper\naddresses the general problem of covariance modeling for multivariate\nfunctional data, and functional Gaussian graphical models in particular. As a\nfirst step, a new notion of separability for the covariance operator of\nmultivariate functional data is proposed, termed partial separability, leading\nto a novel Karhunen-Lo\\`eve-type expansion for such data. Next, the partial\nseparability structure is shown to be particularly useful in order to provide a\nwell-defined functional Gaussian graphical model that can be identified with a\nsequence of finite-dimensional graphical models, each of identical fixed\ndimension. This motivates a simple and efficient estimation procedure through\napplication of the joint graphical lasso.

The strategy is to train\na meta-classifier that predicts whether a given target model is Trojaned. To\ntrain the meta-model without knowledge of the attack strategy, we introduce a\ntechnique called jumbo learning that samples a set of Trojaned models following\na general distribution.

However, most existing methods dedicate to developing more\nsophisticated attention modules for achieving better performance, which\ninevitably increase model complexity. To overcome the paradox of performance\nand complexity trade-off, this paper proposes an Efficient Channel Attention\n(ECA) module, which only involves a handful of parameters while bringing clear\nperformance gain. By dissecting the channel attention module in SENet, we\nempirically show avoiding dimensionality reduction is important for learning\nchannel attention, and appropriate cross-channel interaction can preserve\nperformance while significantly decreasing model complexity. Therefore, we\npropose a local cross-channel interaction strategy without dimensionality\nreduction, which can be efficiently implemented via $1D$ convolution.\nFurthermore, we develop a method to adaptively select kernel size of $1D$\nconvolution, determining coverage of local cross-channel interaction.

In view of\nthese limitations with the bulk method, a new method based on thermal bonding\ntechnique (TBM) has been developed to manufacture Micromegas detectors in a\nmuch simplified and efficient way without etching.

The effectiveness of this method was investigated by testing Micromegas\ndetector prototypes built with the method. Both X-rays and electron beams were\nused to characterize the prototypes in a gas mixture of argon and CO2 (7%). A\ntypical energy resolution of ~16% (full width at half maximum, FWHM) and an\nabsolute gain greater than 10^4 were obtained with 5.9 keV X-rays.

Though there is a hierarchy in the way humans use\nlanguage by forming paragraphs from sentences and sentences from words,\nhierarchical models have usually not worked that much better than their\ntraditional seq2seq counterparts. This effect is mainly because either the\nhierarchical attention mechanisms are too sparse using hard attention or noisy\nusing soft attention. In this paper, we propose a method based on extracting\nthe highlights of a document; a key concept that is conveyed in a few\nsentences. In a typical text summarization dataset consisting of documents that\nare 800 tokens in length (average), capturing long-term dependencies is very\nimportant, e.g., the last sentence can be grouped with the first sentence of a\ndocument to form a summary.

This universal approximation theorem is\nsuggestive of the potential application of neural networks in learning\nnonlinear operators from data. However, the theorem guarantees only a small\napproximation error for a sufficient large network, and does not consider the\nimportant optimization and generalization errors. To realize this theorem in\npractice, we propose deep operator networks (DeepONets) to learn operators\naccurately and efficiently from a relatively small dataset. A DeepONet consists\nof two sub-networks, one for encoding the input function at a fixed number of\nsensors $x_i, i=1,\\dots,m$ (branch net), and another for encoding the locations\nfor the output functions (trunk net).

A\nhomogeneous spin-1/2 chain model with a FM nearest-neighbor (NN), an\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) inchain, and two diagonal\nAFM interchain couplings (ICs) analyzed within linear spin-wave theory (LSWT)\nreproduces well the observed strong dispersion along the chains and a weak one\nperpendicularly. The ratio R=|J_{a2}/J_{a1}| of the FM NN and the AFM NNN\ncouplings is found as ~0.23, close to the critical point Rc=1/4 which separates\nferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically correlated spiral magnetic ground\nstates in single chains, whereas Rc>0.25 for coupled chains is considerably\nupshifted even for relatively weak IC. Although the measured dispersion can be\ndescribed by homogeneous LSWT, the scattering intensity appears to be\nconsiderably reduced at ~11.5 and ~28 meV. The gap-like feature at 11.5 meV is\nattributed to magnon-phonon coupling whereas based on DMRG simulations of the\ndynamical structure factor the gap at 28 meV is considered to stem partly from\nquantum effects due to the AFM IC. Another contribution is ascribed to the\nintrinsic superstructure from the distorting incommensurate pattern of CaY\ncationic chains adjacent to the CuO2 ones. It gives rise to non-equivalent CuO4\nunits and Cu-O-Cu bond angles Phi and a resulting distribution of all exchange\nintegrals.

The negative\nGaussian curvature of the Fermi surface of SrTiO$_3$ and its resulting negative\nlongitudinal and transverse MR are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 05:47:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

To design a more powerful\nNMN architecture for practical use, we propose Meta Module Network (MMN)\ncentered on a novel meta module, which can take in function recipes and morph\ninto diverse instance modules dynamically. The instance modules are then woven\ninto an execution graph for complex visual reasoning, inheriting the strong\nexplainability and compositionality of NMN. With such a flexible instantiation\nmechanism, the parameters of instance modules are inherited from the central\nmeta module, retaining the same model complexity as the function set grows,\nwhich promises better scalability.

Experiments on GQA and CLEVR datasets validate the\nsuperiority of MMN over state-of-the-art NMN designs.

We investigate a sample of 51\nLBGs at 3.0<z<3.8 with detected [OIII] line emissions and estimated the\nphysical properties of these galaxies to examine the impact of including\nnebular emission data in the SED fitting. We used CIGALE to fit the rest-frame\nUV-to-NIR SEDs of these galaxies and their emission line data simultaneously.\nWe ran CIGALE with and without the nebular model or the emission line data, and\ncompare the results to show the importance of including the nebular emission\nline data in the SED fitting.

Mutations change the properties of\ncells in various ways, including their mechanical properties. Each mutation\nresults in an advantage or disadvantage to grow in the competition between\ndifferent cell types. While changes in signaling processes and biochemistry\nplay an important role, we focus on changes in the mechanical properties by\nstudying the result of variation of growth force and adhesive\ncross-interactions between cell types. For independent mutations of growth\nforce and adhesion strength, the tissue evolves towards cell types with high\ngrowth force and low internal adhesion strength, as both increase the\nhomeostatic pressure. Motivated by biological evidence, we postulate a coupling\nbetween both parameters, such that an increased growth force comes at the cost\nof a higher internal adhesion strength or vice versa. This tradeoff controls\nthe evolution of the tissue, ranging from unidirectional evolution to very\nheterogeneous and dynamic populations. The special case of two competing cell\ntypes reveals three distinct parameter regimes: Two in which one cell type\noutcompetes the other, and one in which both cell types coexist in a highly\nmixed state. Interestingly, a single mutated cell alone suffices to reach the\nmixed state, while a finite mutation rate affects the results only weakly.\nFinally, the coupling between changes in growth force and adhesion strength\nreveals a mechanical explanation for the evolution towards intra-tumor\nheterogeneity, in which multiple species coexist even under a constant\nevolutianary pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 08:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

A fundamental question is whether the acceleration occurs in\ninterplanetary space, or near the Sun. Recent work has shown that CME-driven\nshocks may produce SEPs while still below 5 solar radii. In this work we\nexplore SEP acceleration during the onset of CMEs and shocks even lower in the\ncorona, using realistic suprathermal spectra, for a selection of events. We\nhave calculated quiet-time, pre-event suprathermal particle spectra from 1 AU\nobservations, and scaled them back to the low corona to serve as seed spectra.\nFor each event, AIA observations and the CASHeW framework were used to model\nthe compressive/shock wave kinematics and its interaction with the corona. The\nproton acceleration was then modeled using an analytic diffusive shock\nacceleration model as the shock waves propagate between 1.05 and 1.3 solar\nradii. We demonstrate the capability of low coronal shock-related EUV waves to\naccelerate protons to multi-MeV energies in a matter of minutes, in the very\nearly stages of the associated solar eruptions. We find that strong proton\nenergization occurs for high values of the density jump, Alfven Mach number,\nand shock speed.

We conclude by arguing that this framework can be used to\ntheoretically diagnose student difficulties with computation, distinguish\neducational approaches that focus on material vs. cognitive aspects of\ncomputational literacy, and highlight the benefits and limitations of\nopen-ended projects like computational essays to student learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 10:18:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 16:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

To cope with data paucity, in this paper we explore the\neffectiveness of transfer learning in end-to-end SLT by presenting a\nmultilingual approach to the task. Multilingual solutions are widely studied in\nMT and usually rely on ``\\textit{target forcing}'', in which multilingual\nparallel data are combined to train a single model by prepending to the input\nsequences a language token that specifies the target language. However, when\ntested in speech translation, our experiments show that MT-like \\textit{target\nforcing}, used as is, is not effective in discriminating among the target\nlanguages. Thus, we propose a variant that uses target-language embeddings to\nshift the input representations in different portions of the space according to\nthe language, so to better support the production of output in the desired\ntarget language. Our experiments on end-to-end SLT from English into six\nlanguages show important improvements when translating into similar languages,\nespecially when these are supported by scarce data. Further improvements are\nobtained when using English ASR data as an additional language (up to $+2.5$\nBLEU points).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 10:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

Given their\nextreme properties, they are considered among the most valuable laboratories to\ntest accretion models. Recently, the orbital parameters of a member of this\nclass, IGR J08408-4503, were obtained from optical observations. We used this\ninformation, together with X-ray observations from previous publications and\nnew results from X-ray and optical data collected by INTEGRAL and presented in\nthis work, to study the accretion mechanisms at work in IGR J08408-4503.

An\neffective load-balancing mechanism is required in order to fully utilize the\navailable capacity of the multiple paths. While packet-based load-balancing can\nachieve high utilization, it suffers from reordering. Flow-based load-balancing\nsuch as equal-cost multipath routing (ECMP) spreads traffic uniformly across\nmultiple paths leading to frequent hash collisions and suboptimal performance.\nFinally, flowlet based load-balancing such as CONGA or HULA splits flows into\nsmaller units, which are sent on different paths. Most flowlet based\nload-balancing schemes depend on a proper static setting of the flowlet gap,\nwhich decides when new flowlets are detected. While a too small gap may lead to\nreordering, a too large gap results in missed load-balancing opportunities. In\nthis paper, we propose FlowDyn, which dynamically adapts the flowlet gap to\nincrease the efficiency of the load-balancing schemes while avoiding the\nreordering problem. Using programmable data planes, FlowDyn uses active probes\ntogether with telemetry information to track path latency between different ToR\nswitches. FlowDyn calculates dynamically a suitable flowlet gap that can be\nused for flowlet based load-balancing mechanism. We evaluate FlowDyn\nextensively in simulation, showing that it achieves 3.19 times smaller flow\ncompletion time at 10% load and 1.16x at 90% load.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 10:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

By combining the twin-field concept of\ninterfering phase-sensitive optical states with that of storing quantum states\nup to a cutoff memory time, distances well beyond 700 km with rates well above\n$\\eta_{total}$ can be reached for realistic, high-quality quantum memories (up\nto 1s coherence time) and modest detector efficiencies. Similarly, the standard\nsingle-node quantum repeater, scaling as $\\sqrt{\\eta_{total}}$, can be beaten\nwhen approaching perfect detectors and exceeding spin coherence times of 5s;\nbeating ideal twin-field QKD requires 1s. As for further experimental\nsimplifications, our treatment includes the notion of weak nonlinearities for\nthe light-matter states, a discussion on the possibility of using homodyne\ndetectors, and a comparison between sequential and parallel entanglement\ndistributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 10:49:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 15:37:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 12:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

Here, we study the singlet fission process\nin a pentacene film by employing a combination of transient-grating (TG) and\ntwo-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy complemented by quantum chemical\nand nonadiabatic dynamics calculations. The high sensitivity of heterodyne\ndetected TG spectroscopy enabled us to capture the vibrational coherence and to\nshow that it mediates the transition from the singlet excited electronic state\nto the triplet-pair state.

Recently, the development of increasingly sophisticated\nreconstructions of past plate motions has provided models for plate kinematics\nand plate boundary evolution back in geological time. These models implicitly\ninclude the information necessary to determine the age of ocean floor that has\nsince been lost to subduction. However, due to the lack of an automated and\nefficient method for generating global seafloor age grids, many tectonic\nmodels, most notably those extending back into the Paleozoic, are published\nwithout an accompanying set of age models for oceanic lithosphere. Here we\npresent an automatic, tracer-based algorithm that generates seafloor age grids\nfrom global plate tectonic reconstructions with defined plate boundaries. Our\nmethod enables us to produce the first seafloor age models for the Paleozoic's\nlost ocean basins. Estimated changes in sea level based on bathymetry inferred\nfrom our new age grids show good agreement with sea level record estimations\nfrom proxies, providing a possible explanation for the peak in sea level during\nthe assembly phase of Pangea. This demonstrates how our seafloor age models can\nbe directly compared with observables from the geologic record that extend\nfurther back in time than the constraints from preserved seafloor. Thus, our\nnew algorithm may also aid the further development of plate tectonic\nreconstructions by strengthening the links between geological observations and\ntectonic reconstructions of deeper time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 12:12:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

At the\nend of the compression stroke, the pressure wave propagation and reflection in\na small confined space may greatly influence the end gas autoignition, leading\nto different autoignition characteristics from those in a large or open space.\nThe present study investigates the transient autoignition process in an\niso-octane/air mixture inside a closed chamber under engine-relevant\nconditions. The emphasis is given to the assessing effects of the pressure\nwave-wall reflection and the mechanism of extremely strong pressure\noscillations typical for super-knock. It is found that the hot spot induced\nautoignition in a closed chamber can be greatly affected by shock/pressure wave\nreflection from the end wall. Different autoignition modes respectively from\nthe hot spot and end wall reflection are identified. A non-dimensional\nparameter quantifying the interplay between different length and time scales is\nintroduced, which helps to identify different autoignition regimes including\ndetonation development near the end wall. It is shown that detonation\ndevelopment from the hot spot may cause super-knock with devastating pressure\noscillation. However, the detonation development from the end wall can hardly\nproduce pressure oscillation strong enough for the super-knock. The obtained\nresults provide a fundamental insight into the knocking mechanism in engines\nunder highly boosted conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 13:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

The wide variety of ongoing process in\nHCG 16 make it an ideal case study for exploring which processes are likely to\ndominate the late stages of evolution in compact groups. In order to build a\ncoherent picture of the evolution of this group we make use of the\nmulti-wavelength data available, but focus particularly on HI as a tracer of\ninteractions and evolutionary phase. We reprocess archival VLA L-band data of\nHCG 16 using the multi-scale CLEAN algorithm to accurately recover diffuse\nfeatures. Despite the clear disruption of the HI component of HCG 16 we find\nthat it is not globally HI deficient, even though HCG 16a and b have lost the\nmajority of their HI and almost 50% of the group's HI is in the IGrM, including\na 160 kpc long tail extending towards the SE.

This gas was\nthen swept away by a high speed, close encounter with NGC 848. The starburst\nevents HCG 16c and d have triggered galactic winds which, in the case of HCG\n16d, appears to have disrupted its HI reservoir. The tidal features still\nconnected to these galaxies indicate that more HI will soon be lost to the\nIGrM, while that which remains in the discs will likely be consumed by star\nformation episodes. This is expected to result in a collection of gas-poor\ngalaxies embedded in a diffuse HI structure, which will gradually be evaporated\nby the UV background, resembling the final stage of the evolutionary model of\ncompact groups.

Then, it is\nproved that the MPSS of the system can be decomposed as the weighted sum of the\nMPSS of the individual subsystems. The main result is that the system is\noverall MPSS if and only if it is MPSS in each subsystem.

The\nColombeau theory of generalised scalar fields on manifolds is extended to a\nnonlinear theory of generalised tensor fields which is diffeomorphism invariant\nand has the sheaf property. The generalised Lie derivative for generalised\ntensor fields is introduced and it is shown that this commutes with the\nembedding of distributional tensor fields. It is also shown that the covariant\nderivative of generalised tensor fields commutes with the embedding at the\nlevel of association. The concept of generalised metric is introduced and used\nto develop a nonsmooth theory of differential geometry. It is shown that the\nembedding of a continuous metric results in a generalised metric with well\ndefined connection and curvature. It is also shown that a twice continuously\ndifferentiable metric which is a solution of the vacuum Einstein equations may\nbe embedded into the algebra of generalised tensor fields and has generalised\nRicci curvature associated to zero. Thus, the embedding preserves the Einstein\nequations at the level of association. Finally, we consider an example of a\nmetric which lies outside the Geroch-Traschen class and show that in our\ndiffeomorphism invariant theory the curvature of a cone is associated to a\ndelta function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 14:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

We address\nthis question for the class of {\\em split graphs}, that we observe to be the\nhardest instances for deciding whether the diameter is at most two. We stress\nthat although the diameter of a non-complete split graph can only be either $2$\nor $3$, under the Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH) we cannot compute\nthe diameter of an $n$-vertex $m$-edge split graph in less than quadratic time\n-- in the size $n+m$ of the input. Therefore it is worth to study the\ncomplexity of diameter computation on {\\em subclasses} of split graphs, in\norder to better understand the complexity border. Specifically, we consider the\nsplit graphs with bounded {\\em clique-interval number} and their complements,\nwith the former being a natural variation of the concept of interval number for\nsplit graphs that we introduce in this paper. We first discuss the relations\nbetween the clique-interval number and other graph invariants such as the\nclassic interval number of graphs, the treewidth, the {\\em VC-dimension} and\nthe {\\em stabbing number} of a related hypergraph. Then, in part based on these\nabove relations, we almost completely settle the complexity of diameter\ncomputation on these subclasses of split graphs: - For the $k$-clique-interval\nsplit graphs, we can compute their diameter in truly subquadratic time if\n$k={\\cal O}(1)$, and even in quasi linear time if $k=o(\\log{n})$ and in\naddition a corresponding ordering of the vertices in the clique is given.\nHowever, under SETH this cannot be done in truly subquadratic time for any $k =\n\\omega(\\log{n})$. - For the {\\em complements} of $k$-clique-interval split\ngraphs, we can compute their diameter in truly subquadratic time if $k={\\cal\nO}(1)$, and even in time ${\\cal O}(km)$ if a corresponding ordering of the\nvertices in the stable set is given. Again this latter result is optimal under\nSETH up to polylogarithmic factors. Our findings raise the question whether a\n$k$-clique interval ordering can always be computed in quasi linear time. We\nprove that it is the case for $k=1$ and for some subclasses such as\nbounded-treewidth split graphs, threshold graphs and comparability split\ngraphs.

There is, however, no need to invert the Gauss law: it is satisfied\nautomatically at every time-step as a result of a discrete Noether symmetry,\nand the electric field is updated directly from the Amp\\`ere-Maxwell equation.\nThe method provides an update for the magnetic field that is fully explicit,\ninvolving only local operations.

The update for\nthe electric field is linearly implicit due to the presence of a finite-element\nmass matrix and polarization and magnetization effects in the Amp\\`ere-Maxwell\nequation, hence involving a sparse matrix inversion once at every time step.\nBecause the scheme deals with the electromagnetic fields and not the\npotentials, it also provides the first serious attempt at constructing a\nstructure-preserving numerical scheme for the mixed\nkinetic-ion--drift-kinetic-electron Vlasov-Maxwell model.

This raises the following hypothesis: the deforestation that\noccurred in the period are related to livestock activities. Livestock favors\naccess to water and low fertility sands does not affect production. On the\nother hand, the soybean expansion occurred preferentially on existing pastures\nand on clay soils (Belterra clay), reducing the availability of pastures on\nthese soils. The relative importance of types of soil increases with time. In\nthe area of settlements, the transition from forest to pasture and family crops\noccurred preferentially on the variegated clay. However, it is possible that\nthe prevalence of this transition on this texture has been given due more to\nthe history of occupation of this area. Historically the sandy valleys were the\nfirst to be occupied, and the continuity of the deforestation occurred toward\nthe slopes dominated by variegated clay and plateaus with Belterra clay.

Adversarial Training is a training procedure aiming at\nproviding models that are robust to worst-case perturbations around predefined\npoints. Unfortunately, one of the main issues in adversarial training is that\nrobustness w.r.t. gradient-based attackers is always achieved at the cost of\nprediction accuracy. In this paper, a new algorithm, called Wasserstein\nProjected Gradient Descent (WPGD), for adversarial training is proposed. WPGD\nprovides a simple way to obtain cost-sensitive robustness, resulting in a finer\ncontrol of the robustness-accuracy trade-off. Moreover, WPGD solves an optimal\ntransport problem on the output space of the network and it can efficiently\ndiscover directions where robustness is required, allowing to control the\ndirectional trade-off between accuracy and robustness. The proposed WPGD is\nvalidated in this work on image recognition tasks with different benchmark\ndatasets and architectures.

However, although this approach\ndoes not require expensive manual annotations, it is data hungry and suffers\nfrom domain adaptation problems. As an alternative, in this work, we propose a\nnovel approach for learning event representations named Dynamic Graph Embedding\n(DGE). The assumption underlying our model is that a sequence of images can be\nrepresented by a graph that encodes both semantic and temporal similarity. The\nkey novelty of DGE is to learn jointly the graph and its graph embedding. At\nits core, DGE works by iterating over two steps: 1) updating the graph\nrepresenting the semantic and temporal similarity of the data based on the\ncurrent data representation, and 2) updating the data representation to take\ninto account the current data graph structure. The main advantage of DGE over\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised approaches is that it does not require any\ntraining set, but instead learns iteratively from the data itself a\nlow-dimensional embedding that reflects their temporal and semantic similarity.\nExperimental results on two benchmark datasets of real image sequences captured\nat regular time intervals demonstrate that the proposed DGE leads to event\nrepresentations effective for temporal segmentation.

We observed comet 21P/G-Z in the mid-infrared wavelength region\nusing the Cooled Mid-infrared Camera and Spectrometer (COMICS) on the 8.2 m\nSubaru Telescope on UT 2005 July 5. Here, we report the unidentified infrared\n(UIR) emission features of comet 21P/G-Z, which are likely due to complex\norganic molecules (both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons), and the thermal\nemission from amorphous/crystalline silicates and amorphous carbon grains in\nits mid-infrared low-resolution spectrum. The UIR features at ~8.2 micron, ~8.5\nmicron, and ~11.2 micron found in the spectrum of comet 21P/G-Z could be\nattributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (or hydrogenated amorphous\ncarbons) contaminated by N- or O-atoms, although part of the feature at ~11.2\nmicron comes from crystalline olivine. The other feature at ~9.2 micron might\noriginate from aliphatic hydrocarbons. Comet 21P/G-Z is enriched in complex\norganic molecules. Considering that the derived mass fraction of crystalline\nsilicates in comet 21P/G-Z is typical of comets, we propose that the comet\noriginated from a circumplanetary disk of giant planets (similar to Jupiter and\nSaturn) where was warmer than the typical comet-forming region (5-30 au from\nthe Sun) and was suitable for the formation of complex organic molecules.\nComets from circumplanetary disks might be enriched in complex organic\nmolecules, such as comet 21P/G-Z, and may have provided pre-biotic molecules to\nancient Earth by direct impact or meteor showers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 15:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

The stationary distribution\nof this model can be approximated to a normal distribution, with mean and\nvariance related to the salt concentration used in the erythrocyte osmotic\nfragility assay. The proposed model can generalize the classical Boltzmann\nsigmoidal model often used in adjusting the stationary experimental data\ndistribution. A typical osmotic fragility curve is constructed from the\nabsorbance of free hemoglobin as a function of the decrease in NaCl (X)\nconcentration and allows the determination of H50, an osmotic fragility\nvariable that represents the saline concentration capable of promoting 50%\nlysis, and dX, an osmotic stability variable that represents 1/4 of the\nvariation in salt concentration required to promote 100% lysis.

The mechanism behind the spin selective capture of electrons in\nGa$^{2+}$ paramagnetic centers is revisited in this paper to address\ninconsistencies common to most previously presented models. Primarily, these\nerrors manifest themselves as major disagreements with the experimental\nobservations of two key characteristics of this phenomenon: the effective\nOverhauser-like magnetic field and the width of the photoluminescence\nLorentzian-like curves as a function of the illumination power. These features\nare not only essential to understand the spin dependent recombination in GaAsN,\nbut are also key to the design of novel spintronic devices. Here we demonstrate\nthat the particular structure of the electron capture expressions introduces\nspurious electron-nucleus correlations that artificially alter the balance\nbetween the hyperfine and the Zeeman contributions. This imbalance strongly\ndistorts the effective magnetic field and width characteristics. In this work\nwe propose an alternative recombination mechanism that preserves the\nelectron-nucleus correlations and, at the same time, keeps the essential\nproperties of the spin selective capture of electrons. This mechanism yields a\nsignificant improvement to the agreement between experimental and theoretical\nresults.

Many efforts have made to\nunderstand its mechanism and have further identified many proteins and DNA\nsequence variations as suspected targets for therapy.

Here, we develop a computational software combining Cox\nproportional-hazards model and stability-selection to unearth an overlooked,\nyet the most important cancer drivers hidden in massive data from The Cancer\nGenome Atlas (TCGA), including 11,574 RNAseq samples and clinic data.\nGenerally, noncoding RNAs primarily regulate cancer deaths and work as the\ndeadliest cancer inducers and repressors, in contrast to proteins as\nconventionally thought. Especially, processed-pseudogenes serve as the primary\ncancer inducers, while lincRNA and antisense RNAs dominate the repressors.\nStrikingly, noncoding RNAs serves as the universal strongest regulators for all\ncancer types although personal clinic variables such as alcohol and smoking\nsignificantly alter cancer genome. Furthermore, noncoding RNAs also work as\ncentral hubs in cancer regulatory network and as biomarkers to discriminate\ncancer types. Therefore, noncoding RNAs overall serve as the deadliest cancer\nregulators, which refreshes the basic concept of cancer mechanism and builds a\nnovel basis for cancer research and therapy.

This step --\ncalled sequence alignment -- is the computational bottleneck because: (1) it is\nimplemented using quadratic-time dynamic programming algorithms and (2) the\nmajority of candidate locations in the reference genome do not align with a\ngiven read due to high dissimilarity. Calculating the alignment of such\nincorrect candidate locations consumes an overwhelming majority of a modern\nread mapper's execution time.\n  In this thesis, we introduce four new algorithms (GateKeeper, Shouji, MAGNET,\nand SneakySnake) that function as a pre-alignment step and aim to filter out\nmost incorrect candidate locations. The first key idea of our pre-alignment\nfilters is to provide high filtering accuracy by correctly detecting all\nsimilar segments shared between two sequences. The second key idea is to\nexploit the massively parallel architecture of modern FPGAs for accelerating\nour filtering algorithms. We also develop an efficient CPU implementation of\nthe SneakySnake algorithm for commodity desktops and servers. We evaluate the\nbenefits and downsides of our pre-alignment filtering approach in detail using\n12 real datasets. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our hardware\npre-alignment filters show two to three orders of magnitude speedup over their\nequivalent CPU implementations. We also demonstrate that integrating our\nhardware pre-alignment filters with the state-of-the-art read aligners reduces\nthe aligner's execution time by up to 21.5x. Finally, we show that efficient\nCPU implementation of pre-alignment filtering still provides significant\nbenefits. We show that SneakySnake on average reduces the execution time of the\nbest performing CPU-based read aligners Edlib and Parasail, by up to 43x and\n57.9x, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 15:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-10"}

In the\nfilamentary sub-regions NGC2023/2024, NGC2068/2071, and L1622, 1768 starless\ndense cores were identified, ~28-45% of which are self-gravitating prestellar\ncores.
