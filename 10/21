The key idea of SneakySnake is to reduce the\napproximate string matching (ASM) problem to the single net routing (SNR)\nproblem in VLSI chip layout. In the SNR problem, we are interested in finding\nthe optimal path that connects two terminals with the least routing cost on a\nspecial grid layout that contains obstacles. The SneakySnake algorithm quickly\nsolves the SNR problem and uses the found optimal path to decide whether or not\nperforming sequence alignment is necessary. Reducing the ASM problem into SNR\nalso makes SneakySnake efficient to implement on CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs.\nResults: SneakySnake significantly improves the accuracy of pre-alignment\nfiltering by up to four orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art\npre-alignment filters, Shouji, GateKeeper, and SHD.

For example, with Global Positioning System (GPS)-equipped\nsmart and wearable devices, many applications can gather, process, and share\nrich metadata, such as geolocation, trajectories, elevation, and time. For\nexample, fitness applications, such as Strava and Runkeeper, utilize\ninformation for activity tracking, and have recently witnessed a boom in\npopularity. Those trackers have their own web platforms, and allow users to\nshare activities on such platforms, or even with other social network\nplatforms. To preserve privacy of users while allowing sharing, those platforms\nallow users to disclose partial information, such as the elevation profile for\nan activity, which supposedly will not leak the location trajectory.\n  In this work we examine the extent to which publicly available elevation\nprofiles can be used to predict the location trajectory of users. To tackle\nthis problem, we devise three threat settings under which the city, borough, or\neven a route can be predicted. Those threat settings define the amount of\ninformation available to the adversary to launch the prediction attacks.\nEstablishing that simple features of elevation profiles, e.g., spectral\nfeatures, are insufficient, we devise both natural language processing\n(NLP)-inspired text-like representation and computer vision-inspired image-like\nrepresentation of elevation profiles, and we convert the problem at hand into\ntext and image classification problem. We use both traditional machine\nlearning- and deep learning-based techniques, and achieve a prediction success\nrate ranging from 59.59% to 95.83%.

We consider a\nmodular approach in which the base station employs an array of subarrays, or\n\"tiles.\" Each tile supports a fixed number of antennas, and can therefore be\nimplemented using a separate radio frequency integrated circuit (RFIC), with\nsynchronization across tiles accomplished by employing a phased locked loop in\neach tile to synthesize an on-chip oscillator at the carrier frequency by\nlocking on to a common lower frequency reference clock. Assuming linear minimum\nmean squared error (LMMSE) multiuser detection, we provide an analytical\nframework that can be used to specify the required power spectral density (PSD)\nmask for phase noise for a target system performance. Our analysis for the\nphase noise at the output of the LMMSE receiver indicates two distinct effects:\nself-noise for each user which is inversely proportional to the number of\ntiles, and cross-talk between users which is insensitive to the number of\ntiles, and is proportional to the load factor. These analytical predictions,\nverified by simulations for a 140 GHz system targeting a per-user data rate of\n10 Gbps, show that tiling is a robust approach for scaling. Numerical results\nfor our proposed design approach yield relatively relaxed specifications for\nphase noise PSD masks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 00:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

We demonstrate\nthat OoD detection fails even when using more sophisticated statistics based on\nthe likelihoods of individual samples. To address these issues, we propose a\nnew method that leverages batch normalization. We argue that batch\nnormalization for generative models challenges the traditional i.i.d. data\nassumption and changes the corresponding maximum likelihood objective.

As advocated by\nthis work, such Floquet engineering can be elegantly achieved by the particle\nswarm optimization (PSO) technique from the swarm intelligence family. With the\nrecognition that conventional gradient-based optimization approaches are not\nsuitable for directly optimizing topological invariants as integers, the highly\neffective PSO route yields new promises in the search for exotic topological\nphases, requiring limited physical resource. Our results are especially timely\nin view of two important insights from literature: low-frequency driving may be\nbeneficial in creating large topological invariants, but an open-ended\nlow-frequency driving often leads to drastic fluctuations in the obtained\ntopological invariants. Indeed, using a simple continuously driven Harper model\nwith three quasi-energy bands, we show that the Floquet-band Chern numbers can\nenjoy many-fold increase compared with that using a simple harmonic driving of\nthe same period, without demanding more energy cost of the driving field. It is\nalso found that the resulting Floquet insulator bands are still well-gapped,\nwith the maximized topological invariants in agreement with physical\nobservations from Thouless pumping. The emergence of many edge modes under the\nopen boundary condition is also consistent with the bulk-edge correspondence.\nOur results are expected to be highly useful towards the optimization of many\ndifferent types of topological invariants in Floquet topological matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 02:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

For iterative editing or simply faster\ngeneration of smoke flows, dynamic upsampling of an input low-resolution\nnumerical simulation is an attractive, yet currently unattainable goal. In this\npaper, we propose a novel dictionary-based learning approach to the dynamic\nupsampling of smoke flows. For each frame of an input coarse animation, we seek\na sparse representation of small, local velocity patches of the flow based on\nan over-complete dictionary, and use the resulting sparse coefficients to\ngenerate a high-resolution smoke animation sequence. We propose a novel\ndictionary-based neural network which learns both a fast evaluation of sparse\npatch encoding and a dictionary of corresponding coarse and fine patches from a\nsequence of example simulations computed with any numerical solver. Our\nupsampling network then injects into coarse input sequences physics-driven fine\ndetails, unlike most previous approaches that only employed fast procedural\nmodels to add high frequency to the input.

However, federated learning faces the energy constraints of the\nworkers and the high network resource cost due to the fact that a number of\nglobal model transmissions may be required to achieve the target accuracy. To\naddress the energy constraint, a power beacon can be used that recharges energy\nto the workers. However, the model owner may need to pay an energy cost to the\npower beacon for the energy recharge. To address the high network resource\ncost, the model owner can use a WiFi channel, called default channel, for the\nglobal model transmissions. However, communication interruptions may occur due\nto the instability of the default channel quality. For this, special channels\nsuch as LTE channels can be used, but this incurs channel cost. As such, the\nproblem of the model owner is to decide amounts of energy recharged to the\nworkers and to choose channels used to transmit its global model to the workers\nto maximize the number of global model transmissions while minimizing the\nenergy and channel costs. This is challenging for the model owner under the\nuncertainty of the channel, energy and mobility states of the workers. In this\npaper, we thus propose to employ the Deep Q-Network (DQN) that enables the\nmodel owner to find the optimal decisions on the energy and the channels\nwithout any a priori network knowledge.

We argue that the existing deep hashing schemes are defective in two\nissues that seriously affect the performance, i.e., bit independence and bit\nbalance. The former refers to hash codes of different classes should be\nindependent of each other, while the latter means each bit should have a\nbalanced distribution of +1s and -1s. In this paper, we propose a novel\nsupervised deep hashing method, termed Hadamard Codebook based Deep Hashing\n(HCDH), which solves the above two problems in a unified formulation.\nSpecifically, we utilize an off-the-shelf algorithm to generate a binary\nHadamard codebook to satisfy the requirement of bit independence and bit\nbalance, which subsequently serves as the desired outputs of the hash functions\nlearning. We also introduce a projection matrix to solve the inconsistency\nbetween the order of Hadamard matrix and the number of classes. Besides, the\nproposed HCDH further exploits the supervised labels by constructing a\nclassifier on top of the outputs of hash functions. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that HCDH can yield discriminative and balanced binary codes, which\nwell outperforms many state-of-the-arts on three widely-used benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 07:33:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

Rate adaptation algorithms are generally used to choose the\noptimal data rate based on the current channel conditions. State-of-the-art\napproaches leverage physical layer information for rate adaptation, and they\nwork well under certain conditions. However, the above protocols still have\nlimitation under constantly changing flight states and environments for\nair-to-ground links. To solve this problem, we propose StateRate, a\nstate-optimized rate adaptation algorithm that fully exploits the\ncharacteristics of UAV systems using a hybrid deep learning model. The key\nobservation is that the rate adaptation strategy needs to be adjusted according\nto motion-dependent channel models, which can be reflected by flight states. In\nthis work, the rate adaptation protocol is enhanced with the help of the\non-board sensors in UAVs.

Hence assuming that the labels of the unclassified features are randomly\nmissing or their missing-label mechanism is simply ignored, the expected error\nrate of a classifier formed from a partially classified sample is greater than\nthat if the sample were completely classified. We propose to treat the labels\nof the unclassified features as missing data and to introduce a framework for\ntheir missingness in situations where these labels are not randomly missing. An\nexamination of several partially classified data sets in the literature\nsuggests that the unclassified features are not occurring at random but rather\ntend to be concentrated in regions of relatively high entropy in the feature\nspace. Here in the context of two normal classes with a common covariance\nmatrix we consider the situation where the missingness of the labels of the\nunclassified features can be modelled by a logistic model in which the\nprobability of a missing label for a feature depends on its entropy.

In this paper, we develop an automatic lumbar spinal CT image\nsegmentation method to assist LSS diagnosis. The main contributions of this\npaper are the following: 1) a new lumbar spinal CT image dataset is constructed\nthat contains 2393 axial CT images collected from 279 patients, with the ground\ntruth of pixel-level segmentation labels; 2) a dual densely connected U-shaped\nneural network (DDU-Net) is used to segment the spinal canal, dural sac and\nvertebral body in an end-to-end manner; 3) DDU-Net is capable of segmenting\ntissues with large scale-variant, inconspicuous edges (e.g., spinal canal) and\nextremely small size (e.g., dural sac); and 4) DDU-Net is practical, requiring\nno image preprocessing such as contrast enhancement, registration and\ndenoising, and the running time reaches 12 FPS. In the experiment, we achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on the lumbar spinal image segmentation task. We\nexpect that the technique will increase both radiology workflow efficiency and\nthe perceived value of radiology reports for referring clinicians and patients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 08:20:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2020 10:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

Existing solutions usually involve class-balancing strategies, e.g.,\nby loss re-weighting, data re-sampling, or transfer learning from head- to\ntail-classes, but most of them adhere to the scheme of jointly learning\nrepresentations and classifiers. In this work, we decouple the learning\nprocedure into representation learning and classification, and systematically\nexplore how different balancing strategies affect them for long-tailed\nrecognition. The findings are surprising: (1) data imbalance might not be an\nissue in learning high-quality representations; (2) with representations\nlearned with the simplest instance-balanced (natural) sampling, it is also\npossible to achieve strong long-tailed recognition ability by adjusting only\nthe classifier. We conduct extensive experiments and set new state-of-the-art\nperformance on common long-tailed benchmarks like ImageNet-LT, Places-LT and\niNaturalist, showing that it is possible to outperform carefully designed\nlosses, sampling strategies, even complex modules with memory, by using a\nstraightforward approach that decouples representation and classification.

For\nholographic superfluids, we numerically construct dark solitons that have the\nsymmetry-restored phase at their core. A central point is that we include the\ngravitational back-reaction of the matter fields, which becomes important at\nlow temperatures. We study in detail the properties of these solitons under\nvariation of the back-reaction strength via tuning the gravitational constant.\nIn particular, the depletion fraction of the particle number density at the\ncore of the solitons is carefully investigated. In agreement with the\nprobe-limit analysis, the depletion fraction shows the same qualitative\nbehavior as in Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) theory, even if the back-reaction is\nincluded. We find that the depletion decreases with increasing back-reaction\nstrength. Moreover, the inclusion of back-reaction enables us to obtain the\neffective energy density of solitons within holography, which together with an\nevaluation of the surface tension leads to a simple physical explanation for\nthe snake instability of dark solitons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 10:18:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 16:29:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 15:23:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

There have been recent attempts at using pre-trained encoders to deal\nwith this issue. Pre-trained encoder provides representation of the input text\nwhich is then fed to task-specific layers for classification. The entire\nnetwork is fine-tuned on the labeled data from the target task. Unfortunately,\na low-resource biomedical task often has too few labeled instances for\nsatisfactory fine-tuning. Also, if the label space is large, it contains few or\nno labeled instances for majority of the labels. Most biomedical tagging\nsystems treat labels as indexes, ignoring the fact that these labels are often\nconcepts expressed in natural language e.g. `Appearance of lesion on brain\nimaging'. To address these issues, we propose constructing extra labeled\ninstances using label-text (i.e. label's name) as input for the corresponding\nlabel-index (i.e. label's index). In fact, we propose a number of strategies\nfor manufacturing multiple artificial labeled instances from a single label.\nThe network is then fine-tuned on a combination of real and these newly\nconstructed artificial labeled instances.

Competition to bind miRNAs tends in turn to\ncorrelate their targets, establishing effective RNA-RNA interactions that can\ninfluence expression levels, buffer fluctuations and promote signal\npropagation. Such a potential has been characterized mathematically for small\nmotifs both at steady state and \\red{away from stationarity}. Experimental\nevidence, on the other hand, suggests that competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA)\ncrosstalk is rather weak. Extended miRNA-RNA networks could however favour the\nintegration of many crosstalk interactions, leading to significant large-scale\neffects in spite of the weakness of individual links. To clarify the extent to\nwhich crosstalk is sustained by the miRNA interactome, we have studied its\nemergent systemic features in silico in large-scale miRNA-RNA network\nreconstructions. We show that, although generically weak, system-level\ncrosstalk patterns (i) are enhanced by transcriptional heterogeneities, (ii)\ncan achieve high-intensity even for RNAs that are not co-regulated, (iii) are\nrobust to variability in transcription rates, and (iv) are significantly\nnon-local, i.e. correlate weakly with miRNA-RNA interaction parameters.\nFurthermore, RNA levels are generically more stable when crosstalk is\nstrongest. As some of these features appear to be encoded in the network's\ntopology, crosstalk may functionally be favoured by natural selection. These\nresults suggest that, besides their repressive role, miRNAs mediate a weak but\nresilient and context-independent network of cross-regulatory interactions that\ninterconnect the transcriptome, stabilize expression levels and support\nsystem-level responses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 10:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Estimation of the expected performance of the experiment, in terms\nof predicted constraints on cosmological parameters, has so far relied on\ndifferent methodologies and numerical implementations, developed for different\nobservational probes and for their combination. In this paper we present\nvalidated forecasts, that combine both theoretical and observational expertise\nfor different cosmological probes. This is presented to provide the community\nwith reliable numerical codes and methods for Euclid cosmological forecasts. We\ndescribe in detail the methodology adopted for Fisher matrix forecasts, applied\nto galaxy clustering, weak lensing and their combination. We estimate the\nrequired accuracy for Euclid forecasts and outline a methodology for their\ndevelopment. We then compare and improve different numerical implementations,\nreaching uncertainties on the errors of cosmological parameters that are less\nthan the required precision in all cases. Furthermore, we provide details on\nthe validated implementations that can be used by the reader to validate their\nown codes if required. We present new cosmological forecasts for Euclid. We\nfind that results depend on the specific cosmological model and remaining\nfreedom in each setup, i.e. flat or non-flat spatial cosmologies, or different\ncuts at nonlinear scales. The validated numerical implementations can now be\nreliably used for any setup. We present results for an optimistic and a\npessimistic choice of such settings. We demonstrate that the impact of\ncross-correlations is particularly relevant for models beyond a cosmological\nconstant and may allow us to increase the dark energy Figure of Merit by at\nleast a factor of three.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 11:49:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 11:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-26"}

However, none of them pay enough attentions to the performance\nimprovements, which results in two noticeable performance issues. First, such\nsecurity patches exacerbate the problem that the execution paths of the guest\npage table (de)allocations become extremely long, which would consequently\nincrease the latencies of process creations and exits. Second, the patches\nintroduce many additional IOTLB flushes, leading to extra IOTLB misses, and the\nmisses would have negative impacts on I/O performance of all peripheral\ndevices. In this paper, we propose PiBooster, a novel lightweight approach for\nimproving the performance in page table management. First, PiBooster shortens\nthe execution paths of the page table (de)allocations by the PiBooster cache,\nwhich maintains dedicated buffers for serving page table (de)allocations.\nSecond, PiBooster eliminates the additional IOTLB misses with a fine-grained\nvalidation scheme, which performs page table and DMA validations separately,\ninstead of doing both together. We implement a prototype on Xen with Linux as\nthe guest kernel. We do small modifications on Xen (166 SLoC) and Linux kernel\n(350 SLoC). We evaluate the I/O performance in both micro and macro ways. The\nmicro experiment results indicate that PiBooster is able to completely\neliminate the additional IOTLB flushes in the workload-stable environments, and\neffectively reduces (de)allocation time of the page table by 47% on average.\nThe macro benchmarks show that the latencies of the process creations and exits\nare expectedly reduced by 16% on average. Moreover, the SPECINT,lmbench and\nnetperf results indicate that PiBooster has no negative performance impacts on\nCPU computation, network I/O, and disk I/O.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 11:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

The idea is to learn a metric space induced from a normed vector space\non which data from different classes are well separated. Different measures of\nthe separation thus lead to various designs of the objective function in the\nmetric learning model. One classical metric is the Mahalanobis distance, where\na linear transformation matrix is designed and applied on the original dataset\nto obtain a new subspace equipped with the Euclidean norm. The kernelized\nversion has also been developed, followed by Multiple-Kernel learning models.\nIn this paper, we consider metric learning to be the identification of the best\nkernel function with respect to a high class separability in the corresponding\nmetric space. The contribution is twofold: 1) No pairwise computations are\nrequired as in most metric learning techniques; 2) Better flexibility and lower\ncomputational complexity is achieved using the CLAss-Specific (Multiple) Kernel\n- Metric Learning (CLAS(M)K-ML). The proposed techniques can be considered as a\npreprocessing step to any kernel method or kernel approximation technique.

Geoneutrinos, antineutrinos from\nlong-lived natural isotopes responsible for the radiogenic heat flux, provide\nvaluable information for the chemical composition models of the Earth. The\ncalculations of the expected geoneutrino signal are discussed, together with\nexperimental aspects of geoneutrino detection, including the description of\npossible backgrounds and methods for their suppression. At present, only two\ndetectors, Borexino and KamLAND, have reached sensitivity to the geoneutrino.\nThe experiments accumulated a set of $\\sim$190 geoneutrino events and continue\nthe data acquisition. The detailed description of the experiments, their\nresults on geoneutrino detection, and impact on geophysics are presented. The\nstart of operation of other detectors sensitive to geoneutrinos is planned for\nthe near future: the SNO+ detector is being filled with liquid scintillator,\nand the biggest ever 20 kt JUNO detector is under construction.

We present results of the\nanalysis of high-quality broad energy band (0.8-200 keV) data in three\ndifferent spectral states: high/soft, low/very-hard, and transitional state.\nThe broad band spectra can be described in general as the sum of thermal\nComptonization and reflection due to illumination of an optically-thick\naccretion disc. During the high/soft state, blackbody emission is generated\nfrom the accretion disc and the surface of the neutron star. This emission,\nmeasured at a temperature of kTbb ~1.2 keV, is then Comptonized by a thick\ncorona with an electron temperature of ~2.5 keV. For the transitional and\nlow/very-hard state, the spectra are successfully explained with emission from\na double Comptonizing corona. The first component is described by thermal\nComptonization of seed disc/neutron-star photons (kTbb ~1.2 keV) by a cold\ncorona cloud with kT e ~8-10 keV, while the second one originates from lower\ntemperature blackbody photons (kTbb~0.1 keV) Comptonized by a hot corona\n(kTe~35 keV). Finally, from NuSTAR observations, there is evidence that the\nsource is a new clocked burster. The average time between two successive X-ray\nbursts corresponds to ~7.9 ks and ~4.0 ks when the persistent emission\ndecreases by a factor ~2, moving from very hard to transitional state. The\naccretion rate and the decay time of the X-ray bursts longer than ~30 s suggest\nthat the thermonuclear emission is due to mixed H/He burning triggered by\nthermally unstable He ignition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 12:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Each engine can be switched on/off independently and \"optimal\"\noperating power of each engine depends on the available solar power, which\ndepends on the distance from the Sun. Application of the Composite Smooth\nControl (CSC) framework to a heliocentric fuel-optimal trajectory optimization\nfrom the Earth to the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is demonstrated, which\npresents a new approach to deal with multiple-engine problems. Operation of\nengine clusters with 4, 6, 10 and even 20 engines of the same type can be\noptimized. Moreover, engine clusters with different/mixed electric engines are\nconsidered with either 2, 3 or 4 different types of engines. Remarkably, the\nCSC framework allows us 1) to reduce the original multi-point boundary-value\nproblem to a two-point boundary-value problem (TPBVP), and 2) to solve the\nresulting TPBVPs using a single-shooting solution scheme and with a random\ninitialization of the missing costates.

Consequently, it is important to\nunderstand codes that implement such gates transversally. In this paper, we\nadopt an algebraic approach to characterize all stabilizer codes for which\ntransversal $T$ and $T^{-1}$ gates preserve the codespace. Our Heisenberg\nperspective reduces this to a finite geometry problem that translates to the\ndesign of certain classical codes. We prove three corollaries: (a) For any\nnon-degenerate $[[ n,k,d ]]$ stabilizer code supporting a physical transversal\n$T$, there exists an $[[ n,k,d ]]$ CSS code with the same property; (b)\nTriorthogonal codes are the most general CSS codes that realize logical\ntransversal $T$ via physical transversal $T$; (c) Triorthogonality is necessary\nfor physical transversal $T$ on a CSS code to realize the logical identity. The\nmain tool we use is a recent efficient characterization of certain diagonal\ngates in the Clifford hierarchy (arXiv:1902.04022). We refer to these gates as\nQuadratic Form Diagonal (QFD) gates. Our framework generalizes all existing\ncode constructions that realize logical gates via transversal $T$.

In the Bayesian framework, this can be pursued by restricting\nthe model structure and prior to favor interpretable models. Fundamentally,\nhowever, interpretability is about users' preferences, not the data generation\nmechanism; it is more natural to formulate interpretability as a utility\nfunction. In this work, we propose an interpretability utility, which\nexplicates the trade-off between explanation fidelity and interpretability in\nthe Bayesian framework. The method consists of two steps. First, a reference\nmodel, possibly a black-box Bayesian predictive model which does not compromise\naccuracy, is fitted to the training data. Second, a proxy model from an\ninterpretable model family that best mimics the predictive behaviour of the\nreference model is found by optimizing the interpretability utility function.\nThe approach is model agnostic -- neither the interpretable model nor the\nreference model are restricted to a certain class of models -- and the\noptimization problem can be solved using standard tools. Through experiments on\nreal-word data sets, using decision trees as interpretable models and Bayesian\nadditive regression models as reference models, we show that for the same level\nof interpretability, our approach generates more accurate models than the\nalternative of restricting the prior.

A model is derived\nfor the diffraction limited image of a particle or dot viewed through a medium\ncontaining density gradients that includes the effect of various experimental\nparameters such as the particle depth, viewing direction and f-number. Using\nthe model we show that non-linearities in the density gradient field lead to\nblurring of the particle/dot image.

In this\nprobabilistic framework, a model is defined as an event in the probability\nspace, and a model or the associated event -- either the true underlying model\nor the parameterized model -- have a quantified probability measure. This\nquantification of a model's probability measure is derived by the MP Theorem,\nin which we have shown that an event's probability measure has an upper-bound\ngiven its conditional distribution on an arbitrary random variable. Through\nthis alternative framework, the notion of model parameters is encompassed in\nthe definition of the model or the associated event. Therefore, this framework\ndeviates from the conventional approach of assuming a prior on the model\nparameters. Instead, the regularizing effects of assuming prior over parameters\nis seen through maximizing probabilities of models or according to information\ntheory, minimizing the information content of a model. The probability of a\nmodel in our framework is invariant to reparameterization and is solely\ndependent on the model's likelihood function. Also, rather than maximizing the\nposterior in a conventional Bayesian setting, the objective function in our\nalternative framework is defined as the probability of set operations (e.g.\nintersection) on the event of the true underlying model and the event of the\nmodel at hand. Our theoretical framework, as a derivation of MP theorem, adds\nclarity to probabilistic learning through solidifying the definition of\nprobabilistic models, quantifying their probabilities, and providing a visual\nunderstanding of objective functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 14:46:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Nov 2019 16:03:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 19:54:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 18:39:08 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 16:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

In this work, the open-source Python package gym-electric-motor\n(GEM) is developed for ease of training of RL-agents for electric motor\ncontrol. Furthermore, this package can be used to compare the trained agents\nwith other state-of-the-art control approaches. It is based on the OpenAI Gym\nframework that provides a widely used interface for the evaluation of\nRL-agents. The initial package version covers different DC motor variants and\nthe prevalent permanent magnet synchronous motor as well as different power\nelectronic converters and a mechanical load model. Due to the modular setup of\nthe proposed toolbox, additional motor, load, and power electronic devices can\nbe easily extended in the future. Furthermore, different secondary effects like\ncontroller interlocking time or noise are considered. An intelligent controller\nexample based on the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm which\ncontrols a series DC motor is presented and compared to a cascaded\nPI-controller as a baseline for future research. Fellow researchers are\nencouraged to use the framework in their RL investigations or to contribute to\nthe functional scope (e.g. further motor types) of the package.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 15:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

However, recent advances in regularization techniques and\nnumerical continuation methods have enabled application of indirect methods to\nvery complex OCPs. This study demonstrates the utility and application of an\nadvanced indirect method, the Unified Trigonometrization Method (UTM), to a\nMars Science Laboratory type entry problem. The objective is to maximize the\nparachute deployment altitude for a free-time, fixed-final-velocity entry\ntrajectory. For entry vehicles, in addition to the bank angle that is\ncharacterized by bang-bang control profiles, there are typically three state\npath constraints that have to be considered, namely, the dynamic pressure, heat\nrate and g-load. This study shows that the UTM enables simultaneous\nregularization of the bang-bang control and satisfaction of the state path\nconstraints. Two scenarios with and without state path constraints are\nconsidered. The results obtained using the UTM for both of these cases are\nfound to be in excellent agreement with a direct optimization method.\nFurthermore, an interesting feature emerges in the optimal control profile of\nthe UTM during the initial high-altitude part of the resulting optimal\ntrajectory for the scenario with state path constraints, which has an appealing\npractical implication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 15:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

Current state-of-the-art methods already\nperform well on \"easy\" datasets, with moderate head pose variations, but may\nnot be robust for \"in-the-wild\" data with poses up to 90{\\deg}. In order to\nincrease robustness to an ensemble of factors of variations (e.g. head pose or\nocclusions), a given layer (e.g. a regressor or an upstream CNN layer) can be\nreplaced by a Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer that uses an ensemble of experts\ninstead of a single one. The weights of this mixture can be learned as gating\nfunctions to jointly learn the experts and the corresponding weights. In this\npaper, we propose to use tree-structured gates which allows a hierarchical\nweighting of the experts (Tree-MoE). We investigate the use of Tree-MoE layers\nin different contexts in the frame of face alignment with cascaded regression,\nfirstly for emphasizing relevant, more specialized feature extractors depending\nof a high-level semantic information such as head pose (Pose-Tree-MoE), and\nsecondly as an overall more robust regression layer. We perform extensive\nexperiments on several challenging face alignment datasets, demonstrating that\nour approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 15:30:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

Similarly to previous methods, our approach is fully\nunsupervised in a sense that it does not require or make any use of annotated\nlandmarks for the target object category. Contrary to previous works, we do\nhowever assume that a landmark detector, which has already learned a structured\nrepresentation for a given object category in a fully supervised manner, is\navailable. Under this setting, our main idea boils down to adapting the given\npre-trained network to the target object categories in a fully unsupervised\nmanner. To this end, our method uses the pre-trained network as a core which\nremains frozen and does not get updated during training, and learns, in an\nunsupervised manner, only a projection matrix to perform the adaptation to the\ntarget categories. By building upon an existing structured representation\nlearned in a supervised manner, the optimization problem solved by our method\nis much more constrained with significantly less parameters to learn which\nseems to be important for the case of unsupervised learning. We show that our\nmethod surpasses fully unsupervised techniques trained from scratch as well as\na strong baseline based on fine-tuning, and produces state-of-the-art results\non several datasets.

We give a kinematic proof assuming compressive shocks and\nanother condition, for example backward incident shocks, or a weak form of the\nLax condition. We also show that for 2+2 interactions (two \"upper\" shocks with\nclockwise flow meeting two \"lower\" shocks with counterclockwise flow in a\nsingle point) the circulation sign can generally not be controlled. For\n$\\gamma$-law pressure we show 2+2 interactions without contact must be either\nsymmetric or antisymmetric, with symmetry favored at low Mach number and low\nshock strength. For full potential flow instead of the Euler equations we\nsurprisingly find, contrary to folklore and prior results for other models,\nthat pure triple shocks without contacts are possible, even for $\\gamma$-law\npressure with $1<\\gamma<3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 09:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

During seed\ndevelopment, the inner mesocarp layer of the pericarp (hull) transitions in\ncolor from white to black as the seed matures. The maturity assessment process\ninvolves the removal of the exocarp of the hull and visually categorizing the\nmesocarp color into varying color classes from immature (white, yellow, orange)\nto mature (brown, and black). This visual color classification is time\nconsuming because the exocarp must be manually removed. In addition, the visual\nclassification process involves human assessment of colors, which leads to\nlarge variability of color classification from observer to observer. A more\nobjective, digital imaging approach to peanut maturity is needed, optimally\nwithout the requirement of removal of the hull's exocarp. This study examined\nthe use of a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) process to determine pod maturity with\nintact pericarps. The HSI method leveraged spectral differences between mature\nand immature pods within a classification algorithm to identify the mature and\nimmature pods. The results showed a high classification accuracy with\nconsistency using samples from different years and cultivars. In addition, the\nproposed method was capable of estimating a continuous-valued, pixel-level\nmaturity value for individual peanut pods, allowing for a valuable tool that\ncan be utilized in seed quality research. This new method solves issues of\nlabor intensity and subjective error that all current methods of peanut\nmaturity determination have.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Oct 2019 22:51:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 00:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-28"}

The baselines introduced in this\ntask are quite limiting because two networks are trained for predicting answers\nand rationales separately. Question and image is used as input to train answer\nprediction network while question, image and correct answer are used as input\nin the rationale prediction network. As rationale is conditioned on the correct\nanswer, it is based on the assumption that we can solve Visual Question\nAnswering task without any error - which is over ambitious. Moreover, such an\napproach makes both answer and rationale prediction two completely independent\nVQA tasks rendering cognition task meaningless. In this paper, we seek to\naddress these issues by proposing an end-to-end trainable model which considers\nboth answers and their reasons jointly. Specifically, we first predict the\nanswer for the question and then use the chosen answer to predict the\nrationale. However, a trivial design of such a model becomes non-differentiable\nwhich makes it difficult to train. We solve this issue by proposing four\napproaches - softmax, gumbel-softmax, reinforcement learning based sampling and\ndirect cross entropy against all pairs of answers and rationales. We\ndemonstrate through experiments that our model performs competitively against\ncurrent state-of-the-art.

In addition, electrons are\naccelerated stochastically which is a slower process that yields lower maximum\nenergies. The combined effect of these two processes determines the overall\nelectron acceleration.

We will show right and left central\ncharge are $c_R=c_L=12 J$ respectively. Our results also show good agreement\nwith Kerr spacetime in the limiting behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 13:13:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-07"}

The proposed Transformer-CNN method uses\nSMILES augmentation for training and inference, and thus the prognosis is based\non an internal consensus. That both the augmentation and transfer learning are\nbased on embeddings allows the method to provide good results for small\ndatasets. We discuss the reasons for such effectiveness and draft future\ndirections for the development of the method.

The design considerations for the\nmetamaterial element as a tunable radiator, the associated biasing circuitry,\nas well as cavity parameters are examined and discussed. A sensing matrix can\nbe constructed from the measured transmit patterns, the singular value spectrum\nof which provides insight into the information capacity of the apertures. We\ninvestigate the singular value spectra of the sensing matrix over a variety of\noperating parameters, such as the number of metamaterial elements, number of\nmasks, and number of radiating elements.

The stability of\nsuch nanofuels over time and under different particle loadings is a very\nimportant parameter to consider before they can be put into practical use. Many\ntechniques exist today to analyze suspension stability, which have been\ndeveloped to analyze water-based nanofluids. Sometimes these techniques can be\nexpensive, and/or require specialized equipment, and/or require a method that\nis invasive and disturbs the suspension. Present research uses a non-contact,\nnon-invasive, low-cost experimental setup to analyze suspension stability over\nlong periods of time. Nanofuels made from carbon-based nanomaterials (acetylene\nblack, multiwalled carbon nanotubes) and metal oxide nanomaterials (copper\noxide, aluminum oxide) with hydrocarbon fuels (canola biodiesel, petrodiesel)\nhave been prepared and their settling rates have been analyzed over the period\nof three days. It is found that metal oxides go through several metastable\nstates as they settle. The effect of initial concentration and liquid column\nheight is shown. It is hoped that present research showcases the positive\ntraits of the presented technique and will spark further interest in nanofuel\nstability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 02:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}
