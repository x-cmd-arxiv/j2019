However, the benefit of MEC cannot be fully exploited, when the\ncommunications link used for off-loading computational tasks is hostile.\nFortunately, the propagation-induced impairments may be mitigated by\nintelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), which are capable of enhancing both the\nspectral- and energy-efficiency. Specifically, an IRS comprises an IRS\ncontroller and a large number of passive reflecting elements, each of which may\nimpose a phase shift on the incident signal, thus collaboratively improving the\npropagation environment. In this paper, the beneficial role of IRSs is\ninvestigated in MEC systems, where single-antenna devices may opt for\noff-loading a fraction of their computational tasks to the edge computing node\nvia a multi-antenna access point with the aid of an IRS. Pertinent\nlatency-minimization problems are formulated for both single-device and\nmulti-device scenarios, subject to practical constraints imposed on both the\nedge computing capability and the IRS phase shift design. To solve this\nproblem, the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique is invoked to decouple\nthe original problem into two subproblems, and then the computing and\ncommunications settings are alternatively optimized using low-complexity\niterative algorithms. It is demonstrated that our IRS-aided MEC system is\ncapable of significantly outperforming the conventional MEC system operating\nwithout IRSs. Quantitatively, about $20~\\%$ computational latency reduction is\nachieved over the conventional MEC system in a single cell of a $300~\\rm{m}$\nradius and $5$ active devices, relying on a $5$-antenna access point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 16:03:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 09:16:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 14:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-14"}

In particular, we obtain a\n$(\\log m)^{1/\\epsilon}$-approximation in time $m^{1+O(1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon})}$ for\nany constant $\\epsilon$, and a $(\\log m)^{f(m)}$-approximation in time\n$m^{1+o(1)}$, for any slowly growing function $m$. We obtain deterministic\nalgorithms with similar guarantees for the Sparsest Cut and the\nLowest-Conductance Cut problems.\n  Our algorithm for the Minimum Balanced Cut problem in fact provides a\nstronger guarantee: it either returns a balanced cut whose value is close to a\ngiven target value, or it certifies that such a cut does not exist by\nexhibiting a large subgraph of $G$ that has high conductance. We use this\nalgorithm to obtain deterministic algorithms for dynamic connectivity and\nminimum spanning forest, whose worst-case update time on an $n$-vertex graph is\n$n^{o(1)}$, thus resolving a major open problem in the area of dynamic graph\nalgorithms. Our work also implies deterministic algorithms for a host of\nadditional problems, whose time complexities match, up to subpolynomial in $n$\nfactors, those of known randomized algorithms. The implications include\nalmost-linear time deterministic algorithms for solving Laplacian systems and\nfor approximating maximum flows in undirected graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 16:52:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 May 2020 17:40:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

This work should be done so that high-level\nvisual information and low-level features such as texture remain as intact as\npossible to the human visual system, while the output image may have different\ndimensions. Thus, simple methods such as scaling and cropping are not adequate\nfor this purpose. In recent years, researchers have tried to improve the\nexisting retargeting methods and introduce new ones. However, a specific method\ncannot be utilized to retarget all types of images. In other words, different\nimages require different retargeting methods. Image retargeting has a close\nrelationship to image saliency detection, which is relatively a new image\nprocessing task. Earlier saliency detection methods were based on local and\nglobal but low-level image information. These methods are called bottom-up\nmethods. On the other hand, newer approaches are top-down and mixed methods\nthat consider the high level and semantic information of the image too. In this\npaper, we introduce the proposed methods in both saliency detection and\nretargeting. For the saliency detection, the use of image context and semantic\nsegmentation are examined, and a novel mixed bottom-up, and top-down saliency\ndetection method is introduced. After saliency detection, a modified version of\nan existing retargeting method is utilized for retargeting the images. The\nresults suggest that the proposed image retargeting pipeline has excellent\nperformance compared to other tested methods.

A second advantage of\nthe use of entropy is that it is possible to obtain reliable results even\nwithout the use of ensembles or analysis restricted to surfaces of section or\nrepresentative planes. This allows for a much more numerically efficient tool\nthat may be incorporated into a working N-body code and applied to numerous\ndynamical problems in planetary dynamics.

Data from several observational\nwindows suggest a complex mass structure with interacting subsystems, which\nmakes the reconstruction of a realistic merging scenario very difficult. A\nmissing key element in this sense is unveiling the cluster mass distribution at\nhigh resolution. We perform such a reconstruction of the cluster inner total\nmass through a strong lensing model based on new spectroscopic redshift\nmeasurements. We use data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on\nthe Very Large Telescope (VLT) to confirm 12 multiple images of 4 sources with\nredshift values from 1.16 to 2.72. We also discover four new multiple images\nand identify 29 cluster members and 35 foreground and background sources. The\nresulting galaxy member and image catalogs are used to build five cluster total\nmass models. The fiducial model consists of 111 small-scale subhalos plus a\ndiffuse component, which is centered $\\sim2$ arcseconds away from the BCG\nbelonging to the east Abell 2163 subcluster. We confirm that the latter is well\nrepresented by a single, large-scale mass component. Its strong elongation\ntowards a second (west) subcluster confirms the existence of a preferential\naxis, corresponding to the merging direction.

This is in large part\ndue to the rapidly growing market demand for dialogue agents capable of\ngoal-oriented behaviour. Due to the business process nature of these\nconversations, end-to-end machine learning systems are generally not a viable\noption, as the generated dialogue agents must be deployable and verifiable on\nbehalf of the businesses authoring them.\n  In this work, we propose a paradigm shift in the creation of goal-oriented\ncomplex dialogue systems that dramatically eliminates the need for a designer\nto manually specify a dialogue tree, which nearly all current systems have to\nresort to when the interaction pattern falls outside standard patterns such as\nslot filling.

We demonstrate how our adaptive\npartitions take advantage of the shape of the optimal $Q$-function and the\njoint space, without sacrificing the worst-case performance. In particular, we\nrecover the regret guarantees of prior algorithms for continuous state-action\nspaces, which additionally require either an optimal discretization as input,\nand/or access to a simulation oracle. Moreover, experiments demonstrate how our\nalgorithm automatically adapts to the underlying structure of the problem,\nresulting in much better performance compared both to heuristics and\n$Q$-learning with uniform discretization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 20:40:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:59:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-20"}

As one\nof the dominating nonverbal channels for eliciting pain expression events,\nfacial expressions has been widely investigated for estimating the pain\nintensity of individual. However, using state-of-the-art deep learning (DL)\nmodels in real-world pain estimation applications poses several challenges\nrelated to the subjective variations of facial expressions, operational capture\nconditions, and lack of representative training videos with labels. Given the\ncost of annotating intensity levels for every video frame, we propose a\nweakly-supervised domain adaptation (WSDA) technique that allows for training\n3D CNNs for spatio-temporal pain intensity estimation using weakly labeled\nvideos, where labels are provided on a periodic basis.

The\ntraining process relies on weak target loss, along with domain loss and source\nloss for domain adaptation of the I3D model. Experimental results obtained\nusing labeled source domain RECOLA videos and weakly-labeled target domain\nUNBC-McMaster videos indicate that the proposed deep WSDA approach can achieve\nsignificantly higher level of sequence (bag)-level and frame (instance)-level\npain localization accuracy than related state-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 21:32:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 17:40:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

Random effects estimates generated by the\nLA were within 10% of the values obtained by the iGLMs, AGH and MCMC\ntechniques. The H-lik approach was 4-30 times faster than AGH and nearly 800\ntimes faster than MCMC.

In this work, we study the QAOA applied to the\nSherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, which can be understood as energy\nminimization of $n$ spins with all-to-all random signed couplings. There is a\nrecent classical algorithm by Montanari that, assuming a widely believed\nconjecture, can efficiently find an approximate solution for a typical instance\nof the SK model to within $(1-\\epsilon)$ times the ground state energy. We hope\nto match its performance with the QAOA.\n  Our main result is a novel technique that allows us to evaluate the\ntypical-instance energy of the QAOA applied to the SK model.

For certain representations,\nnamely rank-$p$ symmetric ones with $p$ not a multiple of 3, it was argued that\nthe ground state exhibits gapless excitations. For the remaining\nrepresentations considered, a finite energy gap exists above the ground state.\nIn this paper, we extend these results to SU($n$) chains in the symmetric\nrepresentation. For a rank-$p$ symmetric representation with $n$ and $p$\ncoprime, we predict gapless excitations above the ground state. If $p$ is a\nmultiple of $n$, we predict a unique ground state with a finite energy gap.\nFinally, if $p$ and $n$ have a greatest common divisor $1<q<n$, we predict a\nground state degeneracy of $n/q$, with a finite energy gap.

Many of the state-of-the-art methods predict the boundaries of\naction instances based on predetermined anchors akin to the two-dimensional\nobject detection detectors. However, it is hard to detect all the action\ninstances with predetermined temporal scales because the durations of instances\nin untrimmed videos can vary from few seconds to several minutes. In this\npaper, we propose a novel action detection architecture named anchor-free\none-stage temporal action detector (AFO-TAD). AFO-TAD achieves better\nperformance for detecting action instances with arbitrary lengths and high\ntemporal resolution, which can be attributed to two aspects. First, we design a\nreceptive field adaption module which dynamically adjusts the receptive field\nfor precise action detection. Second, AFO-TAD directly predicts the categories\nand boundaries at every temporal locations without predetermined anchors.\nExtensive experiments show that AFO-TAD improves the state-of-the-art\nperformance on THUMOS'14.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 03:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-21"}

The conditional mode is often estimated through maximization of\nthe modal regression risk (MRR). In order to apply a gradient method for the\nmaximization, the fundamental challenge is accurate approximation of the\ngradient of MRR, not MRR itself. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we\ntake a novel approach of directly approximating the gradient of MRR. To\napproximate the gradient, we develop kernelized and neural-network-based\nversions of the least-squares log-density derivative estimator, which directly\napproximates the derivative of the log-density without density estimation. With\ndirect approximation of the MRR gradient, we first propose a modal regression\nmethod with kernels, and derive a new parameter update rule based on a\nfixed-point method. Then, the derived update rule is theoretically proved to\nhave a monotonic hill-climbing property towards the conditional mode.\nFurthermore, we indicate that our approach of directly approximating the\ngradient is compatible with recent sophisticated stochastic gradient methods\n(e.g., Adam), and then propose another modal regression method based on neural\nnetworks.

The state\nof PointRNN is composed of point coordinates $\\boldsymbol{P}$ and point states\n$\\boldsymbol{S} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d'}$ ($d'$ denotes the number of state\nchannels). Similarly, the output of PointRNN is composed of $\\boldsymbol{P}$\nand new point features $\\boldsymbol{Y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d''}$ ($d''$\ndenotes the number of new feature channels). Since point clouds are orderless,\npoint features and states from two time steps can not be directly operated.\nTherefore, a point-based spatiotemporally-local correlation is adopted to\naggregate point features and states according to point coordinates. We further\npropose two variants of PointRNN, i.e., Point Gated Recurrent Unit (PointGRU)\nand Point Long Short-Term Memory (PointLSTM). We apply PointRNN, PointGRU and\nPointLSTM to moving point cloud prediction, which aims to predict the future\ntrajectories of points in a set given their history movements. Experimental\nresults show that PointRNN, PointGRU and PointLSTM are able to produce correct\npredictions on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating their\nability to model point cloud sequences.

In this article, the multi-winner auction based caching placement in\nD2D-enabled caching cellular networks is investigated for UT edge caching\nincentive and content caching redundancy reduction. Firstly, a multi-winner\nonce auction for UT edge caching is modeled which auctions multiple contents\nfor multiple UTs. Then the optimization problem for content caching revenue\nmaximization is formulated. Specifically, the \"cache conflict\" restriction\nrelationship among UTs is used as one of the constraints in the problem to\nreduce the content caching redundancy in a UT movement scenario. The problem is\nsolved by semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation to obtain an approximate\noptimal caching placement. Moreover, the payment strategy of the auction is\ndeveloped as a Nash bargaining game for personal profit fairness among the UTs\nwho win the auction for content caching. Subsequently, a multi-winner once\nauction based caching (MOAC) placement algorithm is proposed. In addition, due\nto the high complexity of MOAC, we further propose a heuristic multi-winner\nrepeated auction based caching placement (MRAC) algorithm, which can greatly\nreduce the complexity with only tiny performance loss. Simulation results show\nthat the proposed algorithms can reduce the traffic load and average content\naccess delay effectively compared with the existing caching placement\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 07:44:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-21"}

This paper numerically investigates whether velocity\nsaturation can help to get better current saturation and if that correlates\nwith enhanced fmax. For such a purpose, we used a drift-diffusion simulator\nthat includes several factors that influence output conductance, especially at\nshort channel lengths and-or large drain bias: short-channel electrostatics,\nsaturation velocity, graphene-dielectric interface traps, and self-heating\neffects. As a testbed for our investigation, we analyzed fabricated GFETs with\nhigh extrinsin cutoff frequency fT,x (34 GHz) and fmax (37 GHz). Our\nsimulations allow for a microscopic (local) analysis of the channel parameteres\nsuch as carrier concentration, drift and saturation velocities. For biases far\naway from the Dirac voltage, where the channel behaves as unipolar, we\nconfirmed that the higher is the drift velocity, as close as possible to the\nsaturation velocity, the greater fmax is.

Although their hierarchical organization\nand local feature extraction are inspired by the structure of primate visual\nsystems, the lack of lateral connections in such architectures critically\ndistinguishes their analysis from biological object processing. The idea of\nenriching CNNs with recurrent lateral connections of convolutional type has\nbeen put into practice in recent years, in the form of learned recurrent\nkernels with no geometrical constraints. In the present work, we introduce\nbiologically plausible lateral kernels encoding a notion of correlation between\nthe feedforward filters of a CNN: at each layer, the associated kernel acts as\na transition kernel on the space of activations. The lateral kernels are\ndefined in terms of the filters, thus providing a parameter-free approach to\nassess the geometry of horizontal connections based on the feedforward\nstructure. We then test this new architecture, which we call KerCNN, on a\ngeneralization task related to global shape analysis and pattern completion:\nonce trained for performing basic image classification, the network is\nevaluated on corrupted testing images. The image perturbations examined are\ndesigned to undermine the recognition of the images via local features, thus\nrequiring an integration of context information - which in biological vision is\ncritically linked to lateral connectivity. Our KerCNNs turn out to be far more\nstable than CNNs and recurrent CNNs to such degradations, thus validating this\nbiologically inspired approach to reinforce object recognition under\nchallenging conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 10:31:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-21"}

The wind\ndetection is statistically significant in most of the XMM-Newton observations,\nwith velocities ranging from 200 to 1000 km/s. Observed features in the iron K\nband can be explained by both wind absorption or by a forest of iron emission\nlines.

Considerable effort has been put into using light curves observed by\nspace telescopes such as CoRoT, Kepler and TESS for determining stellar\nrotation periods. While rotation periods of active stars can be reliably\ndetermined, the light curves of many older and less active stars (e.g. stars\nsimilar to the Sun) are quite irregular, which hampers determination of their\nperiods.\n  Aims. We examine the factors causing the irregularities in stellar brightness\nvariations and develop a method for determining rotation periods of low\nactivity stars with irregular light curves.\n  Methods.

We\ncalculate the power spectra of stellar brightness variations for various\ncombinations of parameters defining the surface configuration and evolution of\nstellar magnetic features.\n  Results. The short lifetime of spots in comparison to the stellar rotation\nperiod as well as the interplay between spot and facular contributions to\nbrightness variations of stars with near solar activity cause irregularities in\ntheir light curves. The power spectra of such stars often lack a peak\nassociated with the rotation period. Nevertheless, the rotation period can\nstill be determined by measuring the period where the concavity of the power\nspectrum plotted in the log-log scale changes sign, i.e. by identifying the\nposition of the inflection point.\n  Conclusions.

Image recovery techniques from\nMMVs aim to exploit the joint sparsity across the measurements in the sparse\ndomain. This is typically accomplished by extending the use of $\\ell_1$\nregularization of the sparse domain in the single measurement vector (SMV) case\nto using $\\ell_{2,1}$ regularization so that the \"jointness\" can be accounted\nfor. Although effective, the approach is inherently coupled and therefore\ncomputationally inefficient. The method also does not consider current\napproaches in the SMV case that use spatially varying weighted $\\ell_1$\nregularization term. The recently introduced variance based joint sparsity\n(VBJS) recovery method uses the variance across the measurements in the sparse\ndomain to produce a weighted MMV method that is more accurate and more\nefficient than the standard $\\ell_{2,1}$ approach. The efficiency is due to the\ndecoupling of the measurement vectors, with the increased accuracy resulting\nfrom the spatially varying weight. This paper introduces the accelerated VBJS\nwhich reduces computational cost even further by eliminating the requirement to\nfirst approximate the underlying image in order to construct the weights.\nEliminating this preprocessing step moreover reduces the amount of information\nlost from the data, so that our method is more accurate.

We suggest that due to these effects, myosin II minifilaments in\na filamentous context might be in a critical state that reacts faster to\nvarying conditions than in solution.

In this paper,\nwe test the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art methods for detecting\nQPPs using a series of hare-and-hounds exercises.

Such embeddings are able to capture the distributional semantics of\ntheir context, e.g. by word windows on natural language sentences, graph walks\non knowledge graphs or convolutions on images. So far, this context is manually\ndefined, resulting in heuristics which are solely optimized for computational\nperformance on certain tasks like link-prediction. However, such heuristic\nmodels of context are fundamentally different to how humans capture\ninformation. For instance, when reading a multi-modal webpage (i) humans do not\nperceive all parts of a document equally: Some words and parts of images are\nskipped, others are revisited several times which makes the perception trace\nhighly non-sequential; (ii) humans construct meaning from a document's content\nby shifting their attention between text and image, among other things, guided\nby layout and design elements. In this paper we empirically investigate the\ndifference between human perception and context heuristics of basic embedding\nmodels. We conduct eye tracking experiments to capture the underlying\ncharacteristics of human perception of media documents containing a mixture of\ntext and images.

Type 2 diabetes is usually diagnosed for most\npatients later on in life whereas the less common Type 1 diabetes is diagnosed\nearly on in life. People can live healthy and happy lives while living with\ndiabetes, but early detection produces a better overall outcome on most\npatient's health. Thus, to test the accurate prediction of Type 2 diabetes, we\nuse the patients' information from an electronic health records company called\nPractice Fusion, which has about 10,000 patient records from 2009 to 2012. This\ndata contains individual key biometrics, including age, diastolic and systolic\nblood pressure, gender, height, and weight. We use this data on popular machine\nlearning algorithms and for each algorithm, we evaluate the performance of\nevery model based on their classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity,\nspecificity/recall, negative predictive value, and F1 score. In our study, we\nfind that all algorithms other than Naive Bayes suffered from very low\nprecision. Hence, we take a step further and incorporate all the algorithms\ninto a weighted average or soft voting ensemble model where each algorithm will\ncount towards a majority vote towards the decision outcome of whether a patient\nhas diabetes or not.

A key challenge for direct\nintegration of more meaningful domain and task-based evaluation criteria into\nan end-to-end gradient-based training process is the fact that often such\nperformance objectives are not necessarily differentiable and may even require\nadditional decision-making optimization processing. We propose the\nTask-Oriented Prediction Network (TOPNet), an end-to-end learning scheme that\nautomatically integrates task-based evaluation criteria into the learning\nprocess via a learnable surrogate loss function, which directly guides the\nmodel towards the task-based goal. A major benefit of the proposed TOPNet\nlearning scheme lies in its capability of automatically integrating\nnon-differentiable evaluation criteria, which makes it particularly suitable\nfor diversified and customized task-based evaluation criteria in real-world\ntasks. We validate the performance of TOPNet on two real-world financial\nprediction tasks, revenue surprise forecasting and credit risk modeling.

The underlying dilemma is\nhow empirical valued blocks can be compared with ideal binary blocks, an\nintrinsic problem in the direct approach where partitions are solely determined\nthrough such comparisons. Addressing this dilemma, valued networks have either\nbeen dichotomized into binary versions, or novel types of ideal valued blocks\nhave been introduced. Both these workarounds are problematic in terms of\ninterpretability, unwanted data reduction, and the often arbitrary setting of\nmodel parameters.\n  This paper proposes a direct blockmodeling approach that effectively bypasses\nthe dilemma with blockmodeling of valued networks.

It shows how\na metamodel can be easily built with low computational costs, and how it can\nhelp to understand and improve some global results of Telemac. I. INTRODUCTION\nMany sources of uncertainty lie in the real-world problems. Telemac as any\nmodel (i.e. approximation of reality) is error prone since uncertainties appear\nin the initial or boundary conditions, the system parameters, the modelling\nsimplification or the numerical calculations themselves. Therefore, it is\ndifficult to say with confidence if the design of a Telemac model has met all\nthe requirements to be optimal. Calibration consists of tuning the model\nparameters so that the results are in better agreement with a set of\nobservations. This phase is crucial before any further study can be conducted\nby avoiding a meaningless analysis or prediction based on false or too\ninaccurate results. This paper presents a statistical calibration of a Telemac\n2D model (Gironde Estuary in France) with the learning of Telemac errors by a\nmetamodel (i.e. a model of the simulation errors) to make the best use of\nlimited observations data over a short time period. The metamodel here is a\nsimplified version of Telemac behaving the same for all the locations where\nobservation points are available. If the metamodel is correct, it will be able\nto compute as Telemac would do but with a highly reduced computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 15:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-24"}

This\nmacroscopic rupture dynamics can be successfully mapped on the elastodynamics\nof a moving shear crack. However, this analogy breaks down during the\nnucleation process, which develops at the scale of surface asperities where\nmicrocontacts form. Recent atomistic simulations revealed how a characteristic\njunction size selects if the failure of microcontact junctions either arises by\nbrittle fracture or by ductile yielding. This work aims at bridging these two\ncomplementary descriptions of the onset of frictional slip existing at\ndifferent scales. We first present how the microcontacts failure observed in\natomistic simulations can be conveniently \"coarse-grained\" using an equivalent\ncohesive law. Taking advantage of a scalable parallel implementation of the\ncohesive element method, we study how the different failure mechanisms of the\nmicrocontact asperities interplay with the nucleation and propagation of\nmacroscopic slip fronts along the interface. Notably, large simulations reveal\nhow the failure mechanism prevailing in the rupture of the microcontacts\n(brittle versus ductile) significantly impacts the nucleation of frictional\nsliding and, thereby, the interface frictional strength. This work paves the\nway for a unified description of frictional interfaces connecting the recent\nadvances independently made at the micro- and macroscopic scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 18:51:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 12:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

The success of\na television show in an increasingly technological society is a vast\nmulti-variable formula. The art of success is not just something that happens,\nbut is studied, replicated, and applied. Hollywood can be unpredictable\nregarding success, as many movies and sitcoms that are hyped up and promise to\nbe a hit end up being box office failures and complete disappointments. In\ncurrent studies, linguistic exploration is being performed on the relationship\nbetween Television series and target community of viewers. Having a decision\nsupport system that can display sound and predictable results would be needed\nto build confidence in the investment of a new TV series. The models presented\nin this study use data to study and determine what makes a sitcom successful.\nIn this paper, we use descriptive and predictive modeling techniques to assess\nthe continuing success of television comedies: The Office, Big Bang Theory,\nArrested Development, Scrubs, and South Park. The factors that are tested for\nstatistical significance on episode ratings are character presence, director,\nand writer. These statistics show that while characters are indeed crucial to\nthe shows themselves, the creation and direction of the shows pose implication\nupon the ratings and therefore the success of the shows. We use machine\nlearning based forecasting models to accurately predict the success of shows.\nThe models represent a baseline to understanding the success of a television\nshow and how producers can increase the success of current television shows or\nutilize this data in the creation of future shows. Due to the many factors that\ngo into a series, the empirical analysis in this work shows that there is no\none-fits-all model to forecast the rating or success of a television show.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 01:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

In this problem, the fleet of\nvehicles is categorized into regular and special vehicles. Some customers\nrequire both vehicles' services, whose starting service times at the customer\nare synchronized. Despite its important real-world application, this problem\nhas rarely been studied in the literature. To solve the problem, we propose a\nConstraint Programming (CP) model and an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search\n(ALNS) in which the design of insertion operators is based on solving linear\nprogramming (LP) models to check the insertion feasibility. A number of\nacceleration techniques is also proposed to significantly reduce the\ncomputational time. The computational experiments show that our new CP model\nfinds better solutions than an existing CP-based ANLS, when used on small\ninstances with 25 customers and with a much shorter running time. Our LP-based\nALNS dominates the cp-ALNS, in terms of solution quality, when it provides\nsolutions with better objective values, on average, for all instance classes.\nThis demonstrates the advantage of using linear programming instead of\nconstraint programming when dealing with a variant of vehicle routing problems\nwith relatively tight constraints, which is often considered to be more\nfavorable for CP-based methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 03:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-31"}
