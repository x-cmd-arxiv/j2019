We present the results of simulations performed with the hydrodynamic\ncode GANDALF, to determine the mass accretion rates over a range of binary\nseparations, inclinations and mass ratios. When the binary separation is short,\nthe binary system accretes like a single star, while accretion onto stars in\nwide binaries is barely affected by their companion. We investigate\nintermediate-separation systems in some detail, finding that as the binary\nseparation is increased, accretion rates smoothly decrease from the rate equal\nto that of a single star to the rate expected from two isolated stars.

A\nnumber of techniques, often based on masking, have been developed to produce\nspatially-resolved wettability patterns at the surface of\npoly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) elastomers. A major impediment they face is the\nnatural hydrophobic recovery of PDMS: hydrophilized PDMS surfaces tend to\nreturn to hydrophobicity with time, mainly because of diffusion of low\nmolecular weight silicone species to the surface. Instead of trying to avoid\nthis phenomenon, we propose in this work to take advantage of hydrophobic\nrecovery to modulate spatially the surface wettability of PDMS. Because\ntemperature speeds up the rate of hydrophobic recovery, we show that\nspace-resolved hydrophobic patterns can be produced by locally heating a\nplasma-hydrophilized PDMS surface with microresistors.

Since the initial\nrepertoire is the result of random gene rearrangement, binding of receptors is\nnot limited to pathogen-associated antigens but also includes self antigens.\nThere is a fine balance between having a diverse repertoire, protecting from\nmany different pathogens, and yet reducing its self-reactivity as far as\npossible to avoid damage to self. In the ageing immune system this balance is\naltered, manifesting in reduced specificity of response to pathogens or\nvaccination on a background of higher self-reactivity. To answer the question\nwhether age-related changes of repertoire in the diversity and self/non-self\naffinity balance of antibodies could explain the reduced efficacy of the\nhumoral response in older people, we construct a minimal mathematical model of\nthe humoral immune response.

Since\naccurately modeling human behavior a priori is challenging, such models are\noften parameterized, enabling the robot to adapt predictions based on\nobservations by maintaining a distribution over the model parameters. Although\nthis enables data and priors to improve the human model, observation models are\ndifficult to specify and priors may be incorrect, leading to erroneous state\npredictions that can degrade the safety of the robot motion plan. In this work,\nwe seek to design a predictor which is more robust to misspecified models and\npriors, but can still leverage human behavioral data online to reduce\nconservatism in a safe way. To do this, we cast human motion prediction as a\nHamilton-Jacobi reachability problem in the joint state space of the human and\nthe belief over the model parameters. We construct a new continuous-time\ndynamical system, where the inputs are the observations of human behavior, and\nthe dynamics include how the belief over the model parameters change. The\nresults of this reachability computation enable us to both analyze the effect\nof incorrect priors on future predictions in continuous state and time, as well\nas to make predictions of the human state in the future.

Therefore, this paper\ninvestigates whether a structured machine learning approach can achieve a more\naccurate prediction of running gait event timings from tibial accelerometry.\nForce-based event detection acted as the criterion measure in order to assess\nthe accuracy, repeatability and sensitivity of the predicted gait events. A\nheuristic method and two structured machine learning methods were employed to\nderive initial contact, toe off and stance time from tibial acceleration\nsignals.

All calculated line profiles are in\nexcellent agreement with corresponding 1D solutions. The predicted line\nprofiles from fast rotating stars show a distinct behaviour as a function of\nrotational speed and inclination. This behaviour is tightly coupled to the wind\nstructure and the description of gravity darkening and stellar surface\ndistortion. Conclusions: Our SC methods are ready to be used for quantitative\nanalyses of UV resonance line profiles. When calculating optically thick\ncontinua, both SC methods give reliable results, in contrast to the alternative\nfinite-volume method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 16:41:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-25"}

State-of-the-art approaches for predicting user context have proved\nthe value to leverage multiple sensing modalities for better accuracy. However,\nthose context inference algorithms that run on application processor nowadays\ntend to drain heavy amount of power, making them not suitable for an always-on\nimplementation. We claim that not every sensing modality is suitable to be\nactivated all the time and it remains challenging to build an inference engine\nusing power friendly sensing modalities. Meanwhile, due to the diverse\npopulation, we find it challenging to learn a context inference model that\ngeneralizes well, with limited training data, especially when only using\nalways-on low power sensors. In this work, we propose an approach to leverage\nthe opportunistically-on counterparts in device to improve the always-on\nprediction model, leading to a personalized solution. We model this problem\nusing a weakly supervised learning framework and provide both theoretical and\nexperimental results to validate our design. The proposed framework achieves\nsatisfying result in the IMU based activity recognition application we\nconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 17:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

In this\npaper, we aim to develop a comprehensive methodology to test different kinds of\nmemory in an agent and assess how well the agent can apply what it learns in\ntraining to a holdout set that differs from the training set along dimensions\nthat we suggest are relevant for evaluating memory-specific generalization. To\nthat end, we first construct a diverse set of memory tasks that allow us to\nevaluate test-time generalization across multiple dimensions. Second, we\ndevelop and perform multiple ablations on an agent architecture that combines\nmultiple memory systems, observe its baseline models, and investigate its\nperformance against the task suite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 17:07:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 01:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}

Thus,\nsurrogate models are often developed to capture the essential attributes of the\nfull-blown numerical models. Recent successes of machine learning methods,\nespecially deep learning, across many disciplines offer the possibility that\ncomplex nonlinear connectionist representations may be able to capture the\nunderlying complex structures and nonlinear processes in earth systems. A\ndifficult test for deep learning-based emulation, which refers to function\napproximation of numerical models, is to understand whether they can be\ncomparable to traditional forms of surrogate models in terms of computational\nefficiency while simultaneously reproducing model results in a credible manner.\nA deep learning emulation that passes this test may be expected to perform even\nbetter than simple models with respect to capturing complex processes and\nspatiotemporal dependencies.

Due to the low\nfalse alarm rate and the precise localization (23 deg$^2$ at 90\\%), S190814bv\npresented the community with the best opportunity yet to directly observe an\noptical/near-infrared counterpart to a NSBH merger. To search for potential\ncounterparts, the GROWTH collaboration performed real-time image subtraction on\n6 nights of public Dark Energy Camera (DECam) images acquired in the three\nweeks following the merger, covering $>$98\\% of the localization probability.\nUsing a worldwide network of follow-up facilities, we systematically undertook\nspectroscopy and imaging of optical counterpart candidates.

With two data sets, a simulated and an in-vivo, we use random\nprojections as a representation of the whole space of orthogonal projections.\nThis allows us to study the impact of linear compression in the image space\nwith diverse measures of reconstruction accuracy. In particular, the $L_2$\nerror, variance, SNR, and visual results serve as performance measures to\ndescribe the final image quality. We study their relationships and observe that\nthe $L_2$ error and variance strongly correlate, but as expected minimal $L_2$\nerror does not necessarily correspond to the best visual results. In terms of\nvisual evaluation and SNR, the compression with PCA outperforms all other\nmethods, including rSOS on the uncompressed image space data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 17:41:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 17:51:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 16:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-28"}

However, due to a lack of empirical data, it is still not\nunderstood how particular features of highly inhomogeneous canopy flows affect\nthe Lagrangian statistics. In this work, we study Lagrangian short time\nstatistics by analyzing empirical Lagrangian trajectories in sub-volumes of\nspace that are small in comparison with the canopy height. For the analysis we\nused 3D Lagrangian trajectories measured in a dense canopy flow model in a\nwind-tunnel, using an extended version of real-time 3D particle tracking\nvelocimetry (3D-PTV). One of our key results is that the random turbulent\nfluctuations due to the intense dissipation were more dominant than the flow's\ninhomogeneity in affecting the short-time Lagrangian statistics. This amounts\nto a so-called quasi-homogeneous regime of Lagrangian statistics at small\nscales. Using the Lagrangian dataset we calculate the Lagrangian\nautocorrelation function and the second-order Lagrangian structure-function,\nand extract associated parameters, namely a Lagrangian velocity decorrelation\ntimescale, $T_i$, and the Kolmogorov constant, $C_0$. We demonstrate that in\nthe quasi-homogeneous regime, both these functions are well represented using a\nsecond-order Lagrangian stochastic model that was designed for homogeneous\nflows. Furthermore, we show that the spatial variations of the Lagrangian\nseparation of scales, $T_i/\\tau_\\eta$, and the Kolmogorov constant, $C_0$,\ncannot be explained by the variation of the Reynolds number, $Re_\\lambda$, in\nspace, and that $T_i/\\tau_\\eta$ was small as compared with homogeneous\nturbulence predictions at similar $Re_\\lambda$.

In order to circumvent the\nsample inefficiency of RL, we propose two key ideas that accelerate learning.\nFirst, we propose an iterative pick-place action space that encodes the\nconditional relationship between picking and placing on deformable objects. The\nexplicit structural encoding enables faster learning under complex object\ndynamics. Second, instead of jointly learning both the pick and the place\nlocations, we only explicitly learn the placing policy conditioned on random\npick points. Then, by selecting the pick point that has Maximal Value under\nPlacing (MVP), we obtain our picking policy. This provides us with an informed\npicking policy during testing, while using only random pick points during\ntraining. Experimentally, this learning framework obtains an order of magnitude\nfaster learning compared to independent action-spaces on our suite of\ndeformable object manipulation tasks with visual RGB observations.

In these objects phosphorus is mainly in\nthe gas phase and therefore the elemental initial abundance needed in our\nchemical simulations corresponds to the cosmic one and is thus well\nconstrained.

Then, we express the\nTeukolsky equation in terms of these generic coordinates with focus on\napplications in both the time and frequency domains.

A\ncomparison with the standard form of the Teukolsky equations allows us to\nexpress the regularisation factors in terms of the hyperboloidal degrees of\nfreedom.

The resulting expressions for the Kerr metric and underlying equations\nare simple enough for eventual (semi)-analytical studies.

In\nthis paper, we investigate the interplay between these two aspects. We do so in\nthe context of the electroweak phase transition (EWPT) in the minimal\nscale-invariant theory. We find that the amount of supercooling generally\ndecreases for increasing scalar couplings. However, the stabilization of the\nelectroweak scale against the Planck scale requires the absence of Landau poles\nin the respective energy range. Scalar couplings at the TeV scale can therefore\nnot become larger than $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. As a consequence, all fully\nconsistent parameter points predict the EWPT not to complete before the QCD\ntransition, which then eventually triggers the generation of the electroweak\nscale. We also discuss the potential of the model to give rise to an observable\ngravitational wave signature, as well as the possibility to accommodate a dark\nmatter candidate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 18:00:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Jan 2020 20:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

This deconfined QCD matter is expected to exist just\nfor very short times after the collision. All the information one can get about\nthe plasma is obtained from the particles that reach the detectors. Among them,\nheavy vector mesons are particularly important. The abundance of $ c {\\bar c}$\nand $b {\\bar b}$ states produced in a heavy ion collision is a source of\ninformation about the plasma. In contrast to the light mesons, that completely\ndissociate when the plasma is formed, heavy mesons presumably undergo a partial\nthermal dissociation. The dissociation degree depends on the temperature and\nalso on the presence of magnetic fields and on the density (chemical\npotential). So, in order to get information about the plasma out of the\nquarkonium abundance data, one needs to resort to models that provide the\ndependence of the dissociation degree on these factors. Holographic\nphenomenological models provide a nice description for charmonium and\nbottomonium quasi-states in a plasma. In particular, quasi-normal modes\nassociated with quarkonia states have been studied recently for a plasma with\nmagnetic fields. Here we extend this analysis of quasinormal models to the case\nwhen charmonium and bottomonium are inside a plasma with finite density. The\ncomplex frequencies obtained are then compared with a Breit Wigner\napproximation for the peaks of the corresponding thermal spectral functions, in\norder to investigate the quantitative agreement of the different descriptions\nof quarkonium quasi-states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 19:46:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 13:13:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

We are able to determine integrated abundance\nratios for 16 species of 14 elements, of $\\alpha$-elements (Mg,Si,Ca,Ti),\nFe-peak (Sc,Mn,Cr,Ni,Cu,and Zn), and n-capture elements (Y,Ba). While the mean\nNa abundance is found to be slightly enhanced and halo-like, our method does\nnot allow us to probe an abundance spread that would be expected in this light\nelement if multiple populations are present in Pal 13.

Nonlinearity or temporal\ndependence in the dynamics is often captured by allowing the operator\nparameters to vary temporally, or by re-fitting a model with a\ntemporally-invariant linear operator in a sliding window. Both procedures tend\nto be excellent for prediction purposes over small time horizons, but are\ngenerally time-consuming and, crucially, do not provide a global prior model\nfor the temporally-varying dynamics that is realistic.

A variety of mechanical forces\nact on these complexes in the cartilage extracellular matrix, motivating the\nneed for a quantitative description which links their structure and mechanical\nresponse. Studies using electron microscopy have imaged the HA-aggrecan brush\nbut require adsorption to a surface, dramatically altering the complex from its\nnative conformation. We use magnetic tweezers force spectroscopy to measure\nchanges in extension and mechanical response of an HA chain as aggrecan\nmonomers bind and form a bottlebrush. This technique directly measures changes\nundergone by a single complex with time and under varying solution conditions.\nUpon addition of aggrecan, we find a large swelling effect manifests when the\nHA chain is under very low external tension (i.e. stretching forces less than\n~1 pN). We use models of force-extension behavior to show that repulsion\nbetween the aggrecans induces an internal tension in the HA chain.

By\nenzymatically deglycosylating aggrecan, we show that aggrecan glycosylation is\nthe structural feature which causes HA stiffening. We then construct a simple\nstochastic binding model to show that variable glycosylation leads to a wide\ndistribution of internal tensions in HA, causing variations in the mechanics at\nmuch longer length-scales.

First, a microscopic model that describes the real-time\ndynamics of the fissioning system can justify or rule out some of the\napproximations.

We briefly\npresent in this contribution the time-dependent superfluid local density\napproximation (TDSLDA) approach to nuclear fission, approach that has become a\nvery successful theoretical model in many areas of many-body research. The\nTDSLDA incorporates the effects of the continuum, the dynamics of the pairing\nfield, and the numerical solution is implemented with controlled approximations\nand negligible numerical corrections.

The $z\\sim1.5$ sample is systematicallty offset towards lower\nS$_{32}$ and higher [SII]/H$\\alpha$ at fixed [OIII]/H$\\beta$ relative to $z=0$\nHII regions. By comparing to photoionization model grids, we find that such\ntrends can be explained by a scenario in which the ionizing spectrum is harder\nat fixed O/H with increasing redshift, but are inconsistent with an increase in\nionization parameter at fixed O/H. This analysis demonstrates the advantages of\nexpanding beyond the strongest rest-optical lines for evolutionary studies, and\nthe particular utility of [SIII] for characterizing evolving ISM conditions and\nstellar compositions. These measurements provide a basis for estimating [SIII]\nline strengths for high-redshift galaxies, a line that the James Webb Space\nTelescope will measure out to z~5.5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 00:25:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 21:16:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

To detect both seen and unseen anomalies, we introduce a novel deep\nweakly-supervised approach, namely Pairwise Relation prediction Network\n(PReNet), that learns pairwise relation features and anomaly scores by\npredicting the relation of any two randomly sampled training instances, in\nwhich the pairwise relation can be anomaly-anomaly, anomaly-unlabeled, or\nunlabeled-unlabeled.

PReNet can then\ndetect any seen/unseen abnormalities that fit the learned pairwise abnormal\npatterns, or deviate from the normal patterns. Further, this pairwise approach\nalso seamlessly and significantly augments the training anomaly data. Empirical\nresults on 12 real-world datasets show that PReNet significantly outperforms\nnine competing methods in detecting seen and unseen anomalies.

In this\npaper, we argue that the fine-tuning can be interpreted as a shortcoming of the\nexplanatory capacity of the model: in particular it signals a lack of\nexplanatory depth. In support of this argument, we develop a schema -- for (a\ncertain class of) models that arise broadly in physical settings -- that\nquantitatively relates fine-tuning of observables to a lack of depth of\nexplanations based on these models. We apply our schema in two different\nsettings in which, within each setting, we compare the depth of two competing\nexplanations. The first setting involves explanations for the Euclidean nature\nof spatial slices of the universe today: in particular, we compare an\nexplanation provided by the big-bang model of the early 1970s (where no\ninflationary period is included) with an explanation provided by a general\nmodel of cosmic inflation. The second setting has a more phenomenological\ncharacter, where the goal is to infer from a limited sequence of data points,\nusing maximum entropy techniques, the underlying probability distribution from\nwhich these data are drawn. In both of these settings we find that our analysis\nfavors the model that intuitively provides the deeper explanation of the\nobservable(s) of interest.

UML activity diagrams are flowcharts that\nmodel sequential and concurrent behavior. Although the UML community widely\nadopts such diagrams, there is no standard approach to verify the presence of\ndeadlock and nondeterministic behavior in activity diagrams. Nondeterminism is\nusually neglected in the literature even though it may be considered a very\nrelevant property. This work proposes a framework for the automatic\nverification of deadlock and nondeterminism in UML activity diagrams. It\nintroduces a compositional CSP semantics for activity diagrams that is used to\nautomatically generate CSP specifications from UML models. These specifications\nare the input for the automatic verification of deadlock and nondeterministic\nbehavior using the FDR refinement checker. We propose a plugin for the Astah\nmodeling environment that mechanizes the translation process, and that calls\nFDR in the background to perform the verification of properties. The tool keeps\nthe traceability between a diagram and its CSP specification. It parses the FDR\nresults to highlight the diagram paths that lead to a deadlock or a\nnondeterministic behavior. This framework adds verification capabilities to the\nUML modeling tool and keeps the formal semantics transparent to the users.\nTherefore, the user does not need to understand or manipulate formal notations\nduring modeling. We present the results of a case study that applies the\nproposed framework for the verification of models in the domain of cloud\ncomputing.

The search for life beyond Earth has brought these models\ninto a new light as they connect to one of the two energy sources life can tap.\nThe ability to discriminate between different Earth cooling models, and the\nutility of adopting such models to aid in the assessment of planetary\nhabitability, has been hampered by a lack of uncertainty analysis. This\nmotivates a layered uncertainty analysis for a range of thermal history models\nthat have been applied to the Earth. The analysis evaluates coupled model\ninput, initial condition, and structural uncertainty. Layered model\nuncertainty, together with data uncertainty and multiple working hypotheses\n(another form of uncertainty), means that results must be evaluated in a\nprobabilistic sense even if the models are deterministic. For the Earth's\ncooling history uncertainty leads to ambiguity - multiple models, based on\ndifferent hypotheses, can match data constraints. This has implications for\nusing such models to forecast conditions for exoplanets that share Earth\ncharacteristics but are older than the Earth, i.e., it has implications for\nmodeling the long-term life potential of terrestrial planets. Even for the most\nEarth-like planet we know of, the Earth itself, model uncertainty and ambiguity\nleads to large forecast spreads. Given that this comes from the planet with the\nmost data constraints we should expect larger spreads for models of terrestrial\nplanets in general. The layered uncertainty approach can be expanded by\ncoupling planetary cooling models to climate models and propagating uncertainty\nbetween them to assess habitability from a probabilistic versus a binary view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 04:13:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 22:17:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

In order to see the impact of\nthe initial prepared state of the spin chain environment on the decoherence\nprocess, we assume the spin chain environment prepared in two main ways,\nnamely, either the ground state or the vacuum state in the momentum space. We\ndevelop a general heuristic analysis when the spin chain environment in\nprepared in these states, in order to understand the decoherence process\nagainst the physical parameters. We show that the decoherence process is mainly\ndetermined by the choice of the initial prepared state, the number of spin of\nthe chain, the coupling strength, the anisotropy parameter and the position\nfrom the quantum critical point. In fact, in the strong coupling regime, the\ndecoherence process does not appear for the environment prepared in the vacuum\nstate and it behaves oscillatory in the case of evolution from ground state. On\nthe other hand, in the weak coupling regime and far from the quantum critical\npoint, decoherence induced by the ground state is weaker than that of the\nvacuum state.

However, the same magnetic multilayer harboring skyrmions\ncan sustain a N\\'eel-type strip domain wall along the nanowire length,\npotentially keeping the skyrmions separated from the edge. Here we study the\ninterplay between current driven skyrmions and domain walls and find that they\nincrease the annihilation current and allow the skyrmions to move faster.

We find that\nexcept when this system of PDEs reduces to ODEs because of additional\nsymmetries imposed on the spacetimes, or when they become compatible with each\nother in some special situations, consistent solution to perfect fluid collapse\nwith linear EoS is not available. The end state of collapse with no such\nconstraint of EoS has also been investigated. Since considering arbitrary\npressures in a collapsing cloud to study its end state is difficult as this\nrequires information about the dynamics of collapse not known in general, we\nconsider small perturbations to mass profiles corresponding to inhomogeneous\ndust collapse. This, in turn, provides small pressure perturbations to the\notherwise pressureless fluid.

Consensus on the Ito\nversus Stratonovich suggests stochastic systems embedded with Stratonovich\ndifferential to describe the stochastic evolution of the state vector of real\nphysical systems. The mathematical theory of a scalar time-varying bilinear\nStratonovich stochastic differential equation is available in current texts.\nThe theory of scalar Stratonovich systems was developed by deriving their\nclosed-form solutions and then conditional moments. Practical problems obeying\nvector time-varying bilinear Stratonovich stochastic differential equations are\nubiquitous. However, their formal and systematic estimation theory is not\navailable.

To date Unet has demonstrated\nstate-of-art performance in many complex medical image segmentation tasks,\nespecially under the condition when the training and testing data share the\nsame distribution (i.e. come from the same source domain). However, in clinical\npractice, medical images are acquired from different vendors and centers. The\nperformance of a U-Net trained from a particular source domain, when\ntransferred to a different target domain (e.g. different vendor, acquisition\nparameter), can drop unexpectedly. Collecting a large amount of annotation from\neach new domain to retrain the U-Net is expensive, tedious, and practically\nimpossible. In this work, we proposed a generic framework to address this\nproblem, consisting of (1) an unpaired generative adversarial network (GAN) for\nvendor-adaptation, and (2) a Unet for object segmentation.

In classical settings, involving voltage-driven\ntransport of ions through perm-selective membranes, concentration polarization\nis well understood as formation of steep concentration drop to reach near zero\nconcentration (depletion layer) at the anodic side of cation-selective\nmembranes. In contrast to this classical description, we demonstrate here that\nwhen ICP is driven in a microchannel and coupled with electroosmotic flows a\nlong-tailed fluorescent layer in front of diffusion layer is formed, which can\nbe characterized as an additional plateau in the concentration profile. Using a\nmicro/nanofluidic platform, in situ visualizations, and local concentration\nmeasurements by microelectrode arrays we quantify that this plateau layer has a\nconcentration of 60 % of bulk electrolyte concentration, regardless of the bulk\nconcentration itself.

We observe $^3$MLCT lifetimes from 180 fs\nto 67 ps over a wide range of MLCT energies in different solvents by utilizing\nthe strong solvatochromism of the complexes. Intramolecular electron transfer\nlifetimes governing $^3$MLCT relaxation increase monotonically and\n(super)exponentially as the $^3$MLCT energy is decreased in 1 and 2 by changing\nthe solvent. This behavior can be described with non-adiabatic classical Marcus\nelectron transfer dynamics along the indirect $^3$MLCT->$^3$MC pathway, where\nthe $^3$MC is the lowest energy metal-centered (MC) excited state. In contrast,\nthe $^3$MLCT lifetime in 3 changes non-monotonically and exhibits a maximum.\nThis qualitatively different behaviour results from direct electron transfer\nfrom the $^3$MLCT to the electronic ground state (GS). This pathway involves\nnuclear tunnelling for the high-frequency polypyridyl skeleton mode\n($\\hbar\\omega$ = 1530 cm$^{-1}$), which is more displaced for 3 than for either\n1 or 2, therefore making the direct pathway significantly more efficient in 3.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first observation of an efficient $^3$MLCT->GS\nrelaxation pathway in an Fe polypyridyl complex. Our study suggests that\nfurther extending the MLCT state lifetime requires (1) lowering the $^3$MLCT\nstate energy with respect to the $^3$MC state and (2) suppressing the\nintramolecular distortion of the electron-accepting ligand in the $^3$MLCT\nexcited state to suppress the rate of direct $^3$MLCT->GS electron transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:05:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-31"}

These processes can\nbecome sufficiently weak in two-dimensional materials, giving rise to either\nballistic or hydrodynamic transport, depending on the strength of\nelectron-electron scattering. We show that the ballistic regime is a quantum\ncritical point (QCP) on the regime boundary separating Ohmic and hydrodynamic\ntransport. The QCP corresponds to a \\emph{free} conformal field theory (CFT)\nwith a dynamical scaling exponent $z = 1$. Its nontrivial aspects emerge in\ndevice geometries with shear, wherein the regime has an intrinsic universal\ndissipation, a nonlocal current-voltage relation, and exhibits the critical\nscaling of the underlying CFT. The Fermi surface has electron-hole pockets\nacross all angular scales and the current flow has \\emph{vortices} at all\nspatial scales. We image the fluctuations in high-definition and animate their\nemergence as experimental parameters are tuned to the QCP (movie links in\ncomments). The vortices clearly demonstrate that Pauli exclusion alone can\nproduce collective effects, with low-frequency AC transport mediated by vortex\ndynamics. The scale-invariant spatial structure is much richer than that of an\ninteraction-dominated hydrodynamic regime, which only has a single vortex at\nthe device scale.

The gas kinetic temperature (TK) determines the physical and\nchemical evolution of the Interestellar Medium (ISM).

This work explores the use of HCN and HNC observations, and\nparticularly its I(HCN)/I(HNC) intensity ratio of their J=1-0 lines, as direct\nprobe of the gas kinetic temperature in the molecular ISM. Methods. We obtained\na new set of large-scale observations of both HCN and HNC (1-0) lines along the\nIntegral Shape Filament (ISF) in Orion. In combination with ancillary gas and\ndust temperature measurements, we find a systematic temperature dependence of\nthe observed I(HCN)/I(HNC) intensity ratio across our maps. Additional\ncomparisons with chemical models demonstrate that these observed I(HCN)/I(HNC)\nvariations are driven by the effective destruction and isomerization mechanisms\nof HNC under low energy barriers. Results. The observed variations of\nI(HCN)/I(HNC) with TK can be described with a two-part linear function. This\nempirical calibration is then used to create a temperature map of the entire\nISF.

This notion is strong so that by using it the current state can be\neasily determined. In order to keep the advantage of strong detectability and\nweaken its disadvantage, we can additionally take some \"subsequent outputs\"\ninto account in order to determine the current state. Such a modified\nobservation will make some DES that is not strongly detectable become \"strongly\ndetectable in a weaker sense\", which we call \"{\\it $K$-delayed strong\ndetectability}\" if we observe at least $K$ outputs after the time at which the\nstate need to be determined. In this paper, we study $K$-delayed strong\ndetectability for DESs modeled by finite-state automata (FSAs), and give a\npolynomial-time verification algorithm by using a novel concurrent-composition\nmethod. Note that the algorithm applies to all FSAs. Also by the method, an\nupper bound for $K$ has been found, and we also obtain polynomial-time\nverification algorithms for $(k_1,k_2)$-detectability and\n$(k_1,k_2)$-D-detectability of FSAs firstly studied by [Shu and Lin, 2013]. Our\nalgorithms run in quartic polynomial time and apply to all FSAs, are more\neffective than the sextic polynomial-time verification algorithms given by [Shu\nand Lin 2013] based on the usual assumptions of deadlock-freeness and having no\nunobservable reachable cycle. Finally, we obtain polynomial-time synthesis\nalgorithms for enforcing delayed strong detectability, which are more effective\nthan the exponential-time synthesis algorithms in the supervisory control\nframework in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-31"}

Conventional models of HHG treat the medium\nquantum mechanically, while the driving and emitted fields are treated\nclassically. Such models are usually very successful, but inherently cannot\ncapture the quantum-optical nature of the process. Despite prior works\nconsidering quantum HHG, it is still not known in what circumstances the\nspectral and statistical properties of the radiation considerably depart from\nthe known phenomenology of HHG. Finding such regimes in HHG could lead to novel\nsources of attosecond light with intrinsically quantum statistics such as\nsqueezing and entanglement. In this work, we present a fully quantum\nelectrodynamical theory of extreme nonlinear optics with which we predict new\nquantum effects that alter both spectral and statistical properties of HHG. We\npredict the emission of shifted frequency combs resulting from transitions\nbetween perturbed states of the driven atom, and identify new spectral features\nthat arise from the breakdown of the dipole approximation for the emission.\nMoreover, we find that each HHG emitted photon is a superposition of all\nfrequencies in the spectrum - e.g., HHG creates single photon combs. We also\ndescribe how the HHG process changes in the single atom regime, and discuss how\nour various predictions can be tested experimentally.

The Angular Spread\nFunction (ASF) of the corresponding M-dim channel vector describes the angular\ndensity of the received signal power at the array. The modern literature on\nmassive MIMO has recognized that the knowledge of covariance matrix of user\nchannel vectors is very useful for various applications such as hybrid digital\nanalog beamforming, pilot decontamination, etc. Therefore, most literature has\nfocused on the estimation of such channel covariance matrices. However, in some\napplications such as uplink-downlink covariance transformation (for FDD massive\nMIMO precoding) and channel sounding some form of ASF estimation is required\neither implicitly or explicitly. It turns out that while covariance estimation\nis well-known and well-conditioned, the ASF estimation is a much harder problem\nand is in general ill-posed.

A major challenge facing TPC detectors in\nfuture dark matter experiments will be the reduction of the internal background\nsuch as $^{222}$Rn and the deterioration of the ionization signal due to\nelectronegative impurities. The hermetic quartz chamber can isolate the TPC's\nsensitive volume from external interference and is thus expected to prevent\ncontamination caused by the radioactive and electronegative impurities, which\noriginate from outer detector materials. At the Kamioka Observatory in Japan,\nwe developed a TPC with a quartz chamber that contains a $\\phi 48 \\times 58$ mm\nvolume of liquid xenon. At this development stage, we did not aim at the\nperfect hermeticity of the quartz chamber. Our aim here is twofold: first, to\ndemonstrate via the use of a calibration source that the presence of quartz\nmaterials in the TPC does not impact its operation; and second, to perform\nquantitative measurements of the TPC's characteristics. We successfully\nmeasured electron drift velocities of 1.2--1.7 mm/$\\mu$s in liquid xenon under\nelectric fields ranging from 75--384 V/cm, and also observed small S2 signals\nproduced by a single ionized electron with a light yield of 16.5 $\\pm$ 0.5 PE.\nThese results were consistent with the expected values; therefore, our\ndemonstrations provide a proof of principle for TPCs incorporating a quartz\nchamber.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:10:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Sep 2020 12:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

As a result, approximation\nalgorithms to maximize group centralities were introduced recently. Despite a\nnearly-linear running time, approximation algorithms for group betweenness and\n(to a lesser extent) group closeness are rather slow on large networks due to\nhigh constant overheads.\n  That is why we introduce GED-Walk centrality, a new submodular group\ncentrality measure inspired by Katz centrality. In contrast to closeness and\nbetweenness, it considers walks of any length rather than shortest paths, with\nshorter walks having a higher contribution. We define algorithms that (i)\nefficiently approximate the GED-Walk score of a given group and (ii)\nefficiently approximate the (proved to be $\\mathcal{NP}$-hard) problem of\nfinding a group with highest GED-Walk score.\n  Experiments on several real-world datasets show that scores obtained by\nGED-Walk improve performance on common graph mining tasks such as collective\nclassification and graph-level classification. An evaluation of empirical\nrunning times demonstrates that maximizing GED-Walk (in approximation) is two\norders of magnitude faster compared to group betweenness approximation and for\ngroup sizes $\\leq 100$ one to two orders faster than group closeness\napproximation. For graphs with tens of millions of edges, approximate GED-Walk\nmaximization typically needs less than one minute. Furthermore, our experiments\nsuggest that the maximization algorithms scale linearly with the size of the\ninput graph and the size of the group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 14:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-31"}

We focus on\nweakly-connected graphs where the network is partitioned into a sending part\nand a receiving part. The data collected by the agents might be heterogeneous.\nFor example, some sub-networks might intentionally generate data from a fake\nhypothesis in order to influence other agents. The social learning task is\naccomplished via a diffusion strategy where each agent: i) updates individually\nits belief using its private data; ii) computes a new belief by exponentiating\na linear combination of the log-beliefs of its neighbors. First, we examine\nwhat agents learn over weak graphs (social learning problem). We obtain\nanalytical formulas for the beliefs at the different agents, which reveal how\nthe agents' detection capability and the network topology interact to influence\nthe beliefs. In particular, the formulas allow us to predict when a\nleader-follower behavior is possible, where some sending agents can control the\nmind of the receiving agents by forcing them to choose a particular hypothesis.\nSecond, we consider the dual or reverse learning problem that reveals how\nagents learned: given a stream of beliefs collected at a receiving agent, we\nwould like to discover the global influence that any sending component exerts\non this receiving agent (topology learning problem). A remarkable and perhaps\nunexpected interplay between social and topology learning is observed: given\n$H$ hypotheses and $S$ sending components, topology learning can be feasible\nwhen $H\\geq S$. The latter being only a necessary condition, we examine the\nfeasibility of topology learning for two useful classes of problems.

The hybrid ROM framework is\nbased on using the first principles to model the known physics in conjunction\nwith utilizing the data-driven machine learning tools to model remaining\nresidual that is hidden in data. This framework employs proper orthogonal\ndecomposition as a compression tool to construct orthonormal bases and Galerkin\nprojection (GP) as a model to built the dynamical core of the system. Our\nproposed methodology hence compensates structural or epistemic uncertainties in\nmodels and utilizes the observed data snapshots to compute true modal\ncoefficients spanned by these bases. The GP model is then corrected at every\ntime step with a data-driven rectification using a long short-term memory\n(LSTM) neural network architecture to incorporate hidden physics. A\nGrassmannian manifold approach is also adapted for interpolating basis\nfunctions to unseen parametric conditions. The control parameter governing the\nsystem's behavior is thus implicitly considered through true modal coefficients\nas input features to the LSTM network. The effectiveness of the HAM approach is\ndiscussed through illustrative examples that are generated synthetically to\ntake hidden physics into account.

This can be triggered by either a difference in surface temperature or\na heterogeneity in the topography or chemistry of the surface passively or\nactively. The imbibition of liquid within capillary tubes, horizontal ice\nwicking on either hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrates, and inkjet printing\nfor example are just some classic illustrations of where the Lucas-Washburn\nequation can predict droplet behavior characteristics fairly well. In contrast,\nthis study reveals an example of droplet behavior not previously studied that\nis not well-predicted by the Lucas-Washburn equation, namely the motion of\nferrofluid droplets in the presence of uniform magnetic field. When a\nferrofluid droplet is horizontally exposed to an external uniform magnetic\nfield on a biphilic surface tension gradient in the shape of a wedge, it\nappears to violates the Lucas-Washburn equation which predicts that droplet\ntravel distance should scale with the square root of time (i.e. l~t^(1/2)).\nRather, our experimental results suggest that the movement of the ferrofluid\ndroplet is slower following the relationship, (l~t^(1/3)). Furthermore, due to\nthe relatively high viscosity of water-based ferrofluid droplets, we observed\nthat at the beginning of the motion, the visco-capillary effect dominates the\neffects of the magnetism, and the droplets tend to follow the well-known\nrelationship, (l~t^(1/10)).

This description is\nbased on the minimal nearest-neighbor $J$-$K$-$\\Gamma$ model and builds on the\nidea that the incommensurate counter-rotating order observed experimentally at\nzero field can be treated as a long-distance twisting of a nearby commensurate\norder with six spin sublattices. The results reveal that the behavior of the\nsystem for ${\\bf H}\\parallel{\\bf a}$, ${\\bf H}\\parallel{\\bf b}$ and ${\\bf\nH}\\parallel{\\bf c}$ share a number of qualitative features, including: i) a\nstrong intertwining of the modulated, counter-rotating order with a set of\nuniform orders; ii) the disappearance of the modulated order at a critical\nfield $H^\\ast$, whose value is strongly anisotropic with $H_{\\bf\nb}^\\ast\\!<\\!H_{\\bf c}^\\ast\\!\\ll\\!H_{\\bf a}^\\ast$; iii) the presence of a robust\nzigzag phase above $H^\\ast$; and iv) the fulfillment of the Bragg peak\nintensity sum rule.

When perfectly matched layer (PML) is used to truncate the\nvertical variable only, the medium structure becomes a closed waveguide. The\nGreen function due to a primary source point in this waveguide can be\nconstructed explicitly based on variable separations and Fourier\ntransformations. In the horizontal direction, by properly placing periodical\nPMLs and locating periodic source points imaged by the primary source point,\nthe exciting waveguide Green functions by those imaging points can be assembled\nto construct the Green function due to the primary source point for the\ntwo-layer medium truncated by a UPML. Incorporated with Green's identities,\nthis UPML Green function directly leads to the wellposedness of the acoustic\nscattering problem in a UPML truncation with no constraints about wavenumbers\nor UPML absorbing strength. Consequently, we firstly prove that such a UPML\ntruncating problem is unconditionally resonance free. Moreover, we show, under\nquite general conditions, that this UPML Green function converges to the exact\nlayered Green function exponentially fast as absorbing strength of the UPML\nincreases, which in turn gives rise to the exponential convergence of the\nsolution of the UPML problem towards the original solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-31"}

The caveat regarding\ndifferential privacy is that while it has strong guarantees for privacy,\nprivacy comes at a cost of accuracy. Despite this trade off being a central and\nimportant issue in the adoption of differential privacy, there exists a gap in\nthe literature regarding providing an understanding of the trade off and how to\naddress it appropriately.\n  Through a systematic literature review (SLR), we investigate the\nstate-of-the-art within accuracy improving differentially private algorithms\nfor histogram and synthetic data publishing.

We\nthen directly reconstruct the phase angles from the generations and loads by\nusing the power flow equations. Such a predict-and-reconstruct approach reduces\nthe dimension of the mapping to learn, subsequently cutting down the size of\nthe DNN and the amount of training data needed. We further derive a condition\nfor tuning the size of the DNN according to the desired approximation accuracy\nof the load-generation mapping. We develop a post-processing procedure based on\n$\\ell_1$-projection to ensure the feasibility of the obtained solution, which\ncan be of independent interest.

Thus, understanding and evaluating\nthe flow pattern inside a patient LV is thought to be essential to capture, and\nsubsequently treat, cardiovascular dysfunction at early stages to reduce the\nmortality and morbidity rates. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, often\nderived from patient-specific medical imaging, have been used to provide a more\nfundamental understanding of individual LV flow patterns and pressure fields.\nSuch image-based modeling may advance diagnostic capabilities, treatment\nprotocols and help guide clinicians to choose the most effective therapy of\nCVDs.

The same approach is very\nsuccessful in phase retrieval, where signals are reconstructed from magnitude\nconstraints and general characteristics (sparsity, support, etc.). Instead of\ntaking gradient steps, the optimizer in the constraint based approach, called\nrelaxed-reflect-reflect (RRR), derives its steps from projections to local\nconstraints. In neural networks one such projection makes the minimal\nmodification to the inputs $x$, the associated weights $w$, and the\npre-activation value $y$ at each neuron, to satisfy the equation $x\\cdot w=y$.\nThese projections, along with a host of other local projections (constraining\npre- and post-activations, etc.) can be partitioned into two sets such that all\nthe projections in each set can be applied concurrently, across the network and\nacross all data in the training batch. This partitioning into two sets is\nanalogous to the situation in phase retrieval and the setting for which the\ngeneral purpose RRR optimizer was designed.

There have been notable\nrecent studies attempting to factorize speech signal into these individual\nfactors without requiring any annotation. These studies typically assume\ncontinuous representation for linguistic content, which is not in accordance\nwith general linguistic knowledge and may make the extraction of speaker\ninformation less successful. This paper proposes the mixture factorized\nauto-encoder (mFAE) for unsupervised deep factorization. The encoder part of\nmFAE comprises a frame tokenizer and an utterance embedder. The frame tokenizer\nmodels linguistic content of input speech with a discrete categorical\ndistribution. It performs frame clustering by assigning each frame a soft\nmixture label. The utterance embedder generates an utterance-level vector\nrepresentation. A frame decoder serves to reconstruct speech features from the\nencoders'outputs. The mFAE is evaluated on speaker verification (SV) task and\nunsupervised subword modeling (USM) task. The SV experiments on VoxCeleb 1 show\nthat the utterance embedder is capable of extracting speaker-discriminative\nembeddings with performance comparable to a x-vector baseline. The USM\nexperiments on ZeroSpeech 2017 dataset verify that the frame tokenizer is able\nto capture linguistic content and the utterance embedder can acquire\nspeaker-related information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 08:54:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

As a result, cooperation with neighbours is necessary. However, due\nto the fact that the feature dimensions are different across the agents, their\nclassifier dimensions will also be different. This means that cooperation\ncannot rely on combining the classifier parameters. We instead propose\nsmoothing the outputs of the classifiers, which are the predicted labels. By\ndoing so, the dynamics that describes the evolution of the network classifier\nbecomes more challenging than usual because the classifier parameters end up\nappearing as part of the regularization term as well.
