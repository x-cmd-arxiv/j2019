When these minimization problems are nonconvex, the\ncomputation of their globally optimal solutions is elusive. Together with the\nfact that the expectation operator cannot be evaluated for general probability\ndistributions, it becomes necessary to justify whether the stationary solutions\nof the empirical problems are practical approximations of the stationary\nsolution of the population problem. When these two features, general\ndistribution and nonconvexity, are coupled with nondifferentiability that often\nrenders the problems \"non-Clarke regular\", the task of the justification\nbecomes challenging. Our work aims to address such a challenge within an\nalgorithm-free setting. The resulting analysis is therefore different from the\nmuch of the analysis in the recent literature that is based on local search\nalgorithms. Furthermore, supplementing the classical minimizer-centric\nanalysis, our results offer a first step to close the gap between computational\noptimization and asymptotic analysis of coupled nonconvex nonsmooth statistical\nestimation problems, expanding the former with statistical properties of the\npractically obtained solution and providing the latter with a more practical\nfocus pertaining to computational tractability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Oct 2019 18:25:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-08"}

This work addresses the issue of prohibitive cost of\nreliability analysis using Monte Carlo sampling for expensive-to-evaluate\nhigh-fidelity models by using cheaper-to-evaluate approximations of the\nhigh-fidelity model. The method builds on the Efficient Global Reliability\nAnalysis (EGRA) method, which is a surrogate-based method that uses adaptive\nsampling for refining Gaussian process surrogates for failure boundary location\nusing a single-fidelity model. Our method introduces a two-stage adaptive\nsampling criterion that uses a multifidelity Gaussian process surrogate to\nleverage multiple information sources with different fidelities. The method\ncombines expected feasibility criterion from EGRA with one-step lookahead\ninformation gain to refine the surrogate around the failure boundary. The\ncomputational savings from mfEGRA depends on the discrepancy between the\ndifferent models, and the relative cost of evaluating the different models as\ncompared to the high-fidelity model.

Low-energy electrons (LEEs) produced upon illumination of resist\nmaterials with EUV photons (92 eV) play a central role in the formation of the\nnanopatterns. However, up to now the details of this process are not well\nunderstood. In this work, a novel experimental approach that combines\nLow-Energy Electron Microscopy (LEEM), Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy\n(EELS), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is used to study changes induced by\nelectrons in the 0-40 eV range in thin films of molecular organometallic EUV\nresists known as tin-oxo cages. LEEM-EELS spectroscopic experiments were used\nto detect surface charging upon electron exposure and to estimate the electron\nlanding energy. AFM post-exposure analyses revealed that irradiation of the\nresist with LEEs leads to the densification of the resist layer associated to\ncarbon loss. The same chemical processes that yield densification render the\nsolubility change responsible for the pattern formation in the lithographic\napplication. Remarkably, electrons as low as 1.2 eV are able to induce chemical\nreactions in the Sn-based resist. Based on the thickness profiles resulting\nfrom LEE exposures in the 3-48 mC/cm 2 dose range, a simplified reaction model\nis proposed where the resist undergoes sequential chemical reactions, yielding\nfirst a sparsely cross-linked network, followed by the formation of a denser\ncross-linked network.

White-box test generation is a technique used for automatically\nselecting test inputs using only the source or binary code. However, such\ntechniques encounter challenges when applying them to complex programs. One of\nthe main challenges is handling the dependencies of the unit under test.\n  Objective. Without proper actions, generated tests cannot cover all parts of\nthe source code, or calling the dependencies may cause unexpected side effects\n(e.g., file system or network access). These issues should be tackled while\nmaintaining the advantages of white-box test generation.\n  Method. In this paper, we present an automated source code transformation\napproach tackling the dependency issue for white-box test generation. This\ntechnique isolates the test execution by creating a parameterized sandbox\nwrapped around the transformed unit. We implemented the approach in a\nready-to-use tool using Microsoft Pex as a test generator, and evaluated it on\n10 open-source projects from GitHub having more than 38.000 lines of code in\ntotal.\n  Results.

Also, our results act as a unique\nbaseline for the test generation performance of Microsoft Pex on open-source\nprojects.\n  Conclusion. Based on the results, our source code transformations might serve\nwell for alleviating the isolation problem in white-box test generation as it\nincreases the coverage reached in such situations, while maintaining the\npractical applicability of the tests generated on the isolated code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Oct 2019 20:10:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-12"}

Optimisation is performed by selecting the `best' set of\ninput parameters to elicit the desired objectives.

Our\nalgorithm increases accuracy by 2-4% over the original algorithm for several\nimage classification tasks. Using `soft' labels also enables distilled datasets\nto consist of fewer samples than there are classes as each sample can encode\ninformation for multiple classes.

We present a\nprocedure which notably aids its calculation in the case of Schwarzschild\nspacetime by separating this direct $\\delta$-divergence from the remainder of\nthe retarded Green function. More precisely, the method consists of calculating\nthe multipolar $\\ell$-modes of the direct $\\delta$-divergence and subtracting\nthem from the corresponding modes of the retarded Green function. We illustrate\nthe usefulness of the method with some specific calculations in the case of the\nscalar Green function and self-field for a point scalar charge in Schwarzschild\nspacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 00:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

Although the Euclidean norm of the\nBiLQ error is usually not monotonic, it is monotonic in a different norm that\ndepends on the Lanczos vectors.

The detailed\nfragmentation properties of star-forming filaments remain poorly understood,\nhowever, and the validity of the filament paradigm in the high-mass regime is\nstill unclear. To investigate the density/velocity structure of the filament in\nthe high-mass star-forming region NGC6334, we conducted ALMA observations in\nthe 3mm continuum and the N2H+(1-0) line at ~3arcsec resolution. The filament\nwas detected in both tracers. We identified 26 cores at 3mm and 5\nvelocity-coherent fiber-like features in N2H+ within the filament. The typical\nlength of, and velocity difference between, the fiber-like features of the\nNGC6334 filament are reminiscent of the properties for the fibers of the\nlow-mass star-forming filament B211/B213. Only 2 or 3 of the 5\nvelocity-coherent features are well aligned with the filament and may represent\ngenuine, fiber sub-structures. The core mass distribution has a peak at\n~10Msun. They can be divided into 7 groups of cores, closely associated with\nArTeMiS clumps. The projected separation between cores and the projected\nspacing between clumps are roughly consistent with the effective Jeans length\nin the filament and a physical scale of about 4 times the filament width,\nrespectively, suggesting a bimodal filament fragmentation process. Despite\nbeing one order of magnitude denser and more massive than the B211/B213\nfilament, the NGC6334 filament has a similar density/velocity structure. The\ndifference is that the cores in NGC6334 appear to be an order of magnitude\ndenser and more massive than the cores in Taurus. This suggests that dense\nfilaments may evolve and fragment in a similar manner in low- and high-mass\nstar-forming regions, and that the filament paradigm may hold in the\nintermediate-mass (if not high-mass) star formation regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 06:24:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Nov 2019 13:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

Conclusions: We significantly add to\nthe number of known strong variables, and through Poisson statistics infer an\noccurrence rate for strong variability among L9-T3.5 brown dwarfs of\n40[+32-19]%, which is in agreement with previous estimates. The new variables\nidentified in this work are also excellently suited for extensive\nmulti-wavelength observations dedicated to probing the 3D structure of brown\ndwarf atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 07:18:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 19:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-04"}

Tree\nstructures are particularly suitable for SPH simulation codes, which rely on\nfinding the exact close neighbors of each fluid element (or SPH particle). In\nthis work we present a novel tree structure, named \\textit{$b$-tree}, which\nfeatures an adaptive branching factor to reduce the depth of the neighbor\nsearch. Depending on the particle spatial distribution, finding neighbors using\n\\tree has an asymptotic best case complexity of $O(n)$, as opposed to $O(n \\log\nn)$ for other classical tree structures such as octrees and quadtrees. We also\npresent the proposed tree structure as well as the algorithms to build it and\nto find the exact close neighbors of all particles. We assess the scalability\nof the proposed tree-based algorithms through an extensive set of performance\nexperiments in a shared-memory system.

However, when tackling with\ncomplicated tasks, classical kernel methods are not flexible or \"rich\" enough\nto describe the data and hence could not yield satisfactory performance. In\nthis paper, via Random Fourier Features (RFF), we successfully incorporate the\ndeep architecture into kernel learning, which significantly boosts the\nflexibility and richness of kernel machines while keeps kernels' advantage of\npairwise handling small data. With RFF, we could establish a deep structure and\nmake every kernel in RFF layers could be trained end-to-end. Since RFF with\ndifferent distributions could represent different kernels, our model has the\ncapability of finding suitable kernels for each layer, which is much more\nflexible than traditional kernel-based methods where the kernel is\npre-selected. This fact also helps yield a more sophisticated kernel cascade\nconnection in the architecture. On small datasets (less than 1000 samples), for\nwhich deep learning is generally not suitable due to overfitting, our method\nachieves superior performance compared to advanced kernel methods. On\nlarge-scale datasets, including non-image and image classification tasks, our\nmethod also has competitive performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 08:20:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-08"}

The presented theory is the first\ngeneral relativistic theory that can deal simultaneously with viscous fluids as\nwell as irreversible deformations in solids and hence it also provides a fully\ncovariant formulation of the Newtonian continuum mechanics in arbitrary\ncurvilinear spacetimes. In such a formulation, the matter is considered as a\nRiemann-Cartan manifold with non-vanishing torsion and the main field of the\ntheory being the non-holonomic basis tetrad field also called four-distortion\nfield. Thanks to the variational nature of the governing equations, the theory\nis compatible with the variational structure of the Einstein field equations.\nSymmetric hyperbolic equations are the only admissible equations in our unified\ntheory and thus, all perturbations propagate at finite speeds (even in the\ndiffusive regime) and the Cauchy problem for the governing PDEs is locally\nwell-posed for arbitrary and regular initial data which is very important for\nthe numerical treatment of the presented model. Nevertheless, the numerical\nsolution of the discussed hyperbolic equations is a challenging task because of\nthe presence of the stiff algebraic source terms of relaxation type and\nnon-conservative differential terms.

Continual machine learning aims at a\nhigher level of machine intelligence through providing the artificial agents\nwith the ability to learn online from a non-stationary and never-ending stream\nof data. A key component of such a never-ending learning process is to overcome\nthe catastrophic forgetting of previously seen data, a problem that neural\nnetworks are well known to suffer from. The work described in this thesis has\nbeen dedicated to the investigation of continual learning and solutions to\nmitigate the forgetting phenomena in neural networks. To approach the continual\nlearning problem, we first assume a task incremental setting where tasks are\nreceived one at a time and data from previous tasks are not stored. Since the\ntask incremental setting can't be assumed in all continual learning scenarios,\nwe also study the more general online continual setting. We consider an\ninfinite stream of data drawn from a non-stationary distribution with a\nsupervisory or self-supervisory training signal.

A specific problem that we can\ntackle is the strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard model, which is classically\nintractable and has practical implications in areas like superconductivity. In\nthis Article, we outline the details about the gate sequence, the measurement\nscheme and the relevant error mitigation techniques for the implementation of\nthe Hubbard VQE on a NISQ platform. We perform resource estimation for both\nsilicon spin qubits and superconducting qubits for a 50-qubit simulation, which\ncannot be solved exactly via classical means, and find similar results. The\nnumber of two-qubit gates required is on the order of 20000. Hence, to suppress\nthe mean circuit error count to a level such that we can obtain meaningful\nresults with the aid of error mitigation, we need to achieve a two-qubit gate\nerror rate of $\\sim 10^{-4}$. When searching for the ground state, we need a\nfew days for one gradient-descent iteration, which is impractical. This can be\nreduced to around $10$ minutes if we distribute our task among hundreds of\nquantum processing units. Hence, implementing a 50-qubit Hubbard model VQE on a\nNISQ machine can be on the brink of being feasible in near term, but further\noptimisation of our simulation scheme, improvements in the gate fidelity,\nimprovements in the optimisation scheme and advances in the error mitigation\ntechniques are needed to overcome the remaining obstacles.

In particular, he proved that classical\nrealizability subsumes Cohen's forcing, and even more, gives rise to unexpected\nmodels of set theories. Pursuing the algebraic analysis of these models that\nwas first undertaken by Streicher, Miquel recently proposed to lay the\nalgebraic foundation of classical realizability and forcing within new\nstructures which he called implicative algebras. These structures are a\ngeneralization of Boolean algebras based on an internal law representing the\nimplication. Notably, implicative algebras allow for the adequate\ninterpretation of both programs (i.e. proofs) and their types (i.e. formulas)\nin the same structure. The very definition of implicative algebras takes\nposition on a presentation of logic through universal quantification and the\nimplication and, computationally, relies on the call-by-name\n$\\lambda$-calculus. In this paper, we investigate the relevance of this choice,\nby introducing two similar structures.

The storage investment\nbrings the benefits of stabilizing renewable energy suppliers' outputs, but it\nalso leads to substantial investment costs as well as some surprising changes\nin the market outcome. To study the equilibrium decisions of storage investment\nin the renewable energy suppliers' competition, we model the interactions\nbetween suppliers and consumers using a three-stage game-theoretic model. In\nStage I, at the beginning of the investment horizon, suppliers decide whether\nto invest in storage. Once such decisions have been made, in the day-ahead\nmarket of each day, suppliers decide on their bidding prices and quantities in\nStage II, based on which consumers decide the electricity quantity purchased\nfrom each supplier in Stage III. In the real-time market, a supplier is\npenalized if his actual generation falls short of his commitment. We\ncharacterize a price-quantity competition equilibrium of Stage II, and we\nfurther characterize a storage-investment equilibrium in Stage I incorporating\nelectricity-selling revenue and storage cost. Counter-intuitively, we show that\nthe uncertainty of renewable energy without storage investment can lead to\nhigher supplier profits compared with the stable generations with storage\ninvestment due to the reduced market competition under random energy\ngeneration. Simulations further illustrate results due to the market\ncompetition. For example, a higher penalty for not meeting the commitment, a\nhigher storage cost, or a lower consumer demand can sometimes increase a\nsupplier's profit. We also show that although storage investment can increase a\nsupplier 's profit, the first-mover supplier who invests in storage may benefit\nless than the free-rider competitor who chooses not to invest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 12:03:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 03:22:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 2019 13:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

In this work, we further investigate this hypothesis on a new large\nscale multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) dataset, How2, which has 1.57 times\nlonger mean sentence length than Multi30k and no repetition.

In order\nto probe the ionization level of the IGM and the ionization capabilities of\nbright QSOs at z=4, we have selected a sample of 2508 QSOs from the SDSS survey\n(DR14) at 3.6<z<4.6 and -29.0<M1450<-26.0. Starting from UV/optical rest-frame\nspectra of the whole QSO sample, we estimate the escape fraction and free path\nindividually for each of them. We calculate the Lyman Continuum (LyC) escape\nfraction as the flux ratio blue-ward (~900 A rest-frame) and red-ward (~930 A\nrest-frame) of the Lyman limit. We then obtain the probability distribution\nfunction (PDF) of the individual free paths of the QSOs in the sample and study\nits evolution in luminosity and redshift, comparing our results with the ones\nfound in literature so far. We find a lower limit to the mean LyC escape\nfraction of 0.49, in agreement with the values obtained for both brighter and\nfainter sources at the same redshift. We show that the free paths of ionizing\nphotons are characterized by a skewed distribution function peaked at low\nvalues, with an average of ~49-59 proper Mpc at z~4, after excluding possible\nassociated absorbers. This value is larger than the one obtained at the same\nredshift by many authors in the literature using different techniques. Finally,\nwe also find that the redshift evolution of this parameter results to be\npossibly milder than previously thought. Our new determination of the mean free\npath at z~4 implies that previous estimates of the HI photo-ionization rate\nGamma_HI available in the literature should be corrected by a factor of\n1.2-1.7.

It can be considered\nas the maximum speed that the CME achieves during the expansion into the\ninterplanetary medium. Additionally, in our research we have used not only\nobservations from the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft but\nalso from Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) spacecrafts. We\nfocus on halo and partial halo CMEs during the ascending phase of Solar Cycle\n24. During this period the STEREO spacecraft were in quadrature position in\nrelation to the Earth. We demonstrated that these conditions of the STEREO\nobservations can be crucial for an accurate determination of the transit times\n(TTs) of CMEs to the Earth. In our research we defined a new initial velocity\nof the CME, the maximum velocity determined from the velocity profiles obtained\nfrom a moving linear fit to five consecutive height time points. This new\napproach can be important from the point of view of space weather as the new\nparameter is highly correlated with the final velocity of ICMEs. It allows one\nto predict the TTs with the same accuracy as previous models.

Black-box testing, however,\nrequires to execute the model under test for a large number of candidate test\ninputs. This poses a challenge for a large and practically-important category\nof CPS models, known as compute-intensive CPS (CI-CPS) models, where a single\nsimulation may take hours to complete. We propose a novel approach, namely\nARIsTEO, to enable effective and efficient testing of CI-CPS models. Our\napproach embeds black-box testing into an iterative approximation-refinement\nloop. At the start, some sampled inputs and outputs of the CI-CPS model under\ntest are used to generate a surrogate model that is faster to execute and can\nbe subjected to black-box testing. Any failure-revealing test identified for\nthe surrogate model is checked on the original model. If spurious, the test\nresults are used to refine the surrogate model to be tested again. Otherwise,\nthe test reveals a valid failure. We evaluated ARIsTEO by comparing it with\nS-Taliro, an open-source and industry-strength tool for testing CPS models. Our\nresults, obtained based on five publicly-available CPS models, show that, on\naverage, ARIsTEO is able to find 24% more requirements violations than S-Taliro\nand is 31% faster than S-Taliro in finding those violations.

These quantum walks simulate non-trivial phases\ncharacterized by topological invariants (winding number) $\\pm 1$ which are\nsimilar to the ones observed in topological insulators and polyacetylene. We\nconfirm that the number of phases and their corresponding bound states increase\nstep dependently. In contrast, the size of topological phase and distance\nbetween two bound states are decreasing functions of steps resulting into\nformation of multiple phases as quantum walks proceed (multiphase\nconfiguration). We show that, in the bound states, the winding number and group\nvelocity are ill-defined, and the second moment of the probability density\ndistribution in position space undergoes an abrupt change. Therefore, there are\nphase transitions taking place over the bound states and between two\ntopological phases with different winding numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 13:16:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 10:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-16"}

The key idea is to leverage a large number of\nsimilar few-shot tasks in order to learn how to adapt a base-learner to a new\ntask for which only a few labeled samples are available. As deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) tend to overfit using a few samples only, typical meta-learning\nmodels use shallow neural networks, thus limiting its effectiveness. In order\nto achieve top performance, some recent works tried to use the DNNs pre-trained\non large-scale datasets but mostly in straight-forward manners, e.g., (1)\ntaking their weights as a warm start of meta-training, and (2) freezing their\nconvolutional layers as the feature extractor of base-learners. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel approach called meta-transfer learning (MTL) which learns to\ntransfer the weights of a deep NN for few-shot learning tasks. Specifically,\nmeta refers to training multiple tasks, and transfer is achieved by learning\nscaling and shifting functions of DNN weights for each task. In addition, we\nintroduce the hard task (HT) meta-batch scheme as an effective learning\ncurriculum that further boosts the learning efficiency of MTL. We conduct\nfew-shot learning experiments and report top performance for five-class\nfew-shot recognition tasks on three challenging benchmarks: miniImageNet,\ntieredImageNet and Fewshot-CIFAR100 (FC100). Extensive comparisons to related\nworks validate that our MTL approach trained with the proposed HT meta-batch\nscheme achieves top performance. An ablation study also shows that both\ncomponents contribute to fast convergence and high accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 06:05:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-10"}

In order for recycling to be\neconomically viable, straightforward and cost effective techniques need to be\ndeveloped to separate the individual materials in a composite electrode.\nUltrasonic separation might be such a technique, provided that lithium ion\nbattery microparticles respond predictably to a sound field. Lithium ion\nbattery cathodes contain hydrophobic carbon. Owing to the incompressibility of\na solid, the thin gaseous layer surrounding these hydrophobic particles must\noscillate asymmetrically, when subjected to ultrasound. Consequently, the\nharmonic content of the ultrasound signal radiated from hydrophobic\nmicroparticles must be higher than that from hydrophilic microparticles with\nthe same size. The question of whether the harmonic signal response generated\nby physical hydrophobic microparticles present in lithium ion battery cathodes\nis higher than the harmonic response of other component materials in the\ncathode is the focus of this paper. The scattering response of cathode\nmaterials subjected to 1-MHz ultrasound was measured and compared. The cathode\nmaterials C65, PVDF, and NMC respond differently to 1-MHz ultrasound. The\nsuperharmonic response of C65 has been attributed to asymmetric oscillations\nowing to its hydrophobicity. In addition, C65 hydrophobic microparticles might\nbe suitable candidates for harmonic imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 07:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}
