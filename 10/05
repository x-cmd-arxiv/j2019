Inspired by spatial cognition research\non the mental conceptualization of navigational instructions, we introduce a\nsoft dual attention mechanism defined over the segmented language instructions\nto jointly extract two partial instructions -- one for matching the next\nupcoming visual landmark and the other for matching the local directions to the\nnext landmark. On the similar lines, we also introduce spatial memory scheme to\nencode the local directional transitions. Our work takes advantage of the\nadvance in two lines of research: mental formalization of verbal navigational\ninstructions and training neural network agents for automatic way finding.\nExtensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms previous\nnavigation methods.

One of the key challenges in PHM is to accurately predict\nimpending failures in the equipment. In recent years, solutions for failure\nprediction have evolved from building complex physical models to the use of\nmachine learning algorithms that leverage the data generated by the equipment.\nHowever, failure prediction problems pose a set of unique challenges that make\ndirect application of traditional classification and prediction algorithms\nimpractical. These challenges include the highly imbalanced training data, the\nextremely high cost of collecting more failure samples, and the complexity of\nthe failure patterns. Traditional oversampling techniques will not be able to\ncapture such complexity and accordingly result in overfitting the training\ndata. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel algorithm for\nfailure prediction using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN-FP). GAN-FP first\nutilizes two GAN networks to simultaneously generate training samples and build\nan inference network that can be used to predict failures for new samples.\nGAN-FP first adopts an infoGAN to generate realistic failure and non-failure\nsamples, and initialize the weights of the first few layers of the inference\nnetwork. The inference network is then tuned by optimizing a weighted loss\nobjective using only real failure and non-failure samples. The inference\nnetwork is further tuned using a second GAN whose purpose is to guarantee the\nconsistency between the generated samples and corresponding labels. GAN-FP can\nbe used for other imbalanced classification problems as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2019 16:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-07"}

Manufacturing,\nespecially in the developed world, is moving towards on-demand manufacturing\nmeaning a high mix, low volume product mix. This requires efficient dispatching\nthat can work in dynamic and stochastic environments, meaning it allows for\nquick response to new orders received and can work over a disparate set of shop\nfloor settings. In this paper we address this problem of dispatching in\nmanufacturing. Using reinforcement learning (RL), we propose a new design to\nformulate the shop floor state as a 2-D matrix, incorporate job slack time into\nstate representation, and design lateness and tardiness rewards function for\ndispatching purpose. However, maintaining a separate RL model for each\nproduction line on a manufacturing shop floor is costly and often infeasible.\nTo address this, we enhance our deep RL model with an approach for dispatching\npolicy transfer. This increases policy generalization and saves time and cost\nfor model training and data collection. Experiments show that: (1) our approach\nperforms the best in terms of total discounted reward and average lateness,\ntardiness, (2) the proposed policy transfer approach reduces training time and\nincreases policy generalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2019 16:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-07"}

Similar to other atom-like\nemitters, defect-phonon coupling in hBN governs the characteristic\nsingle-photon emission and provides an opportunity to investigate the atomic\nand electronic structure of emitters as well as the coupling of their spin- and\ncharge-dependent electronic states to phonons. Here, we investigate these\nquestions using photoluminescence excitation (PLE) experiments at T=4K on\nsingle photon emitters in multilayer hBN grown by chemical vapor deposition. By\nscanning up to 250 meV from the zero phonon line (ZPL), we can precisely\nmeasure the emitter's coupling efficiency to different phonon modes. Our\nresults show that excitation mediated by the absorption of one in-plane optical\nphonon increases the emitter absorption probability ten-fold compared to that\nmediated by acoustic or out-of-plane optical phonons. We compare these\nmeasurements against theoretical predictions by first-principles\ndensity-functional theory of four defect candidates, for which we calculate\nprevalent charge states and their spin-dependent coupling to bulk and local\nphonon modes. Our work illuminates the phonon-coupled dynamics in hBN quantum\nemitters at cryogenic temperature, with implications more generally for\nmesoscopic quantum emitter systems in 2D materials and represents possible\napplications in solid-state quantum technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2019 17:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-07"}

Although Bitcoin has many desirable properties, one of its\nfundamental shortcomings is its inability to process transactions at high\nrates. To address this challenge, many subsequent protocols either modify the\nrules of block acceptance (longest chain rule) and reward, or alter the\ngraphical structure of the public ledger from a tree to a directed acyclic\ngraph (DAG). Motivated by these approaches, we introduce a new general\nframework that captures ledger growth for a large class of DAG-based\nimplementations. With this in hand, and by assuming honest miner behaviour, we\n(experimentally) explore how different DAG-based protocols perform in terms of\nfairness, i.e., if the block reward of a miner is proportional to their hash\npower, as well as efficiency, i.e. what proportion of user transactions a\nledger deems valid after a certain length of time.

By electro-optical control of the phase of the scattered light from\nidentical individual metasurface elements, we demonstrate a single prototype\nuniversal programmable metasurface that is capable of both dynamic beam\nsteering and reconfigurable light focusing using one single device.\nReconfigurable universal metasurfaces with arrays of tunable optical antennas\nthus can perform arbitrary optical functions by programmable array-level\ncontrol of scattered light phase, amplitude, and polarization, similar to\ndynamic and programmable memories in electronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2019 17:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-07"}

The mass-loss rate, angular momentum-loss rate\nand the magnetic field properties of low-mass stars are fundamentally linked\nmaking this a challenging task. Of particular interest is the stellar magnetic\nfield geometry. In this work, we consider whether non-dipolar field modes\ncontribute significantly to the spin-down of low-mass stars. We do this using a\nsample of stars that have all been previously mapped with Zeeman-Doppler\nimaging. For a given star, as long as its mass-loss rate is below some critical\nmass-loss rate, only the dipolar fields contribute to its spin-down torque.\nHowever, if it has a larger mass-loss rate, higher order modes need to be\nconsidered. For each star, we calculate this critical mass-loss rate, which is\na simple function of the field geometry. Additionally, we use two methods of\nestimating mass-loss rates for our sample of stars. In the majority of cases,\nwe find that the estimated mass-loss rates do not exceed the critical mass-loss\nrate and hence, the dipolar magnetic field alone is sufficient to determine the\nspin-down torque.

With such multiple star\nformation events Crater II shows similarity to more massive dwarfs that have\nintermediate age populations, however for Crater II there was early quenching\nof the star formation and no intermediate age or younger stars are present. The\nspatial distribution of Crater II stars overall is elliptical in the plane of\nthe sky, the detailed distribution shows a lack of strong central\nconcentration, and some inhomogeneities.

Since statistical entropy does not capture repetitiveness, ad-hoc\nmeasures like the size $z$ of the Lempel--Ziv parse are frequently used to\nestimate it. The size $b \\le z$ of the smallest bidirectional macro scheme\ncaptures better what can be achieved via copy-paste processes, though it is\nNP-complete to compute and it is not monotonic upon symbol appends. Recently, a\nmore principled measure, the size $\\gamma$ of the smallest string\n\\emph{attractor}, was introduced. The measure $\\gamma \\le b$ lower bounds all\nthe previous relevant ones, yet length-$n$ strings can be represented and\nefficiently indexed within space $O(\\gamma\\log\\frac{n}{\\gamma})$, which also\nupper bounds most measures. While $\\gamma$ is certainly a better measure of\nrepetitiveness than $b$, it is also NP-complete to compute and not monotonic,\nand it is unknown if one can always represent a string in $o(\\gamma\\log n)$\nspace.\n  In this paper, we study an even smaller measure, $\\delta \\le \\gamma$, which\ncan be computed in linear time, is monotonic, and allows encoding every string\nin $O(\\delta\\log\\frac{n}{\\delta})$ space because $z =\nO(\\delta\\log\\frac{n}{\\delta})$.

We estimate the fault mode vector by analyzing the temporal\ncorrelation across the GPS measurement residuals and spatial correlation across\nthe vision intensity residuals. In particular, to detect and isolate the vision\nfaults, we developed a superpixel-based piecewise Random Sample Consensus\n(RANSAC) technique to perform spatial voting across image pixels.

We perform\nground vehicle experiments in the semi-urban area of Champaign, IL and have\ndemonstrated the successful detection and isolation of multiple faults.

For improved\nrobustness to intra-class variations, SRC techniques for FR have recently been\nextended to incorporate variational information from an external generic set\ninto an auxiliary dictionary. Despite their success in handling linear\nvariations, non-linear variations (e.g., pose and expressions) between probe\nand reference facial images cannot be accurately reconstructed with a linear\ncombination of images in the gallery and auxiliary dictionaries because they do\nnot share the same type of variations. In order to account for non-linear\nvariations due to pose, a paired sparse representation model is introduced\nallowing for joint use of variational information and synthetic face images.\nThe proposed model, called synthetic plus variational model, reconstructs a\nprobe image by jointly using (1) a variational dictionary and (2) a gallery\ndictionary augmented with a set of synthetic images generated over a wide\ndiversity of pose angles.

The differential rotation between the inner core and the outer core\ninduces fluid motions in the outer core and gives rise to Ohmic dissipation in\nthe presence of the Earth's internal magnetic field. Nutation measurements can\nreflect such dissipation if it is sufficiently strong and thus can provide\ninsights into the properties and dynamics of the Earth's core. In this study we\nperform a set of numerical calculations of the linear perturbations in the\nouter core induced by the FICN at very low Ekman numbers (as small as\n$10^{-11}$). Our numerical results show that the back-reaction of the magnetic\nfield notably alters the structure and length scale of the perturbations\ninduced by the FICN, and thus influences the Ohmic dissipation resulting from\nthe perturbations. When the Ekman number is sufficiently small, Ohmic\ndissipation tends to be insensitive to the fluid viscosity and to the magnetic\ndiffusivity, which allows us to estimate the Ohmic dissipation associated with\nthe FICN without relying on an extrapolation. In contrast to the results of\nBuffett (2010b), the estimated Ohmic dissipation based on our numerical\ncalculations is too weak to account for the observed damping of the FICN mode.\nThis also implies that nutation measurements cannot provide effective\nconstraints on the strength of the magnetic field inside the Earth's outer\ncore.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Oct 2019 04:48:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

One\ncritical task of edge learning is to efficiently utilize the limited radio\nresource to acquire data samples for model training at an edge server. In this\npaper, we develop a novel user scheduling algorithm for data acquisition in\nedge learning, called (data) importance-aware scheduling. A key feature of this\nscheduling algorithm is that it takes into account the informativeness of data\nsamples, besides communication reliability. Specifically, the scheduling\ndecision is based on a data importance indicator (DII), elegantly incorporating\ntwo \"important\" metrics from communication and learning perspectives, i.e., the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and data uncertainty. We first derive an explicit\nexpression for this indicator targeting the classic classifier of support\nvector machine (SVM), where the uncertainty of a data sample is measured by its\ndistance to the decision boundary. Then, the result is extended to\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN) by replacing the distance based uncertainty\nmeasure with the entropy. As demonstrated via experiments using real datasets,\nthe proposed importance-aware scheduling can exploit the two-fold multi-user\ndiversity, namely the diversity in both the multiuser channels and the\ndistributed data samples. This leads to faster model convergence than the\nconventional scheduling schemes that exploit only a single type of diversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Oct 2019 05:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-08"}

In an earlier paper, we suggested another\nmanifestation of this nuclear activity, i.e. elevated H-alpha emission along a\nsection of the Magellanic Stream due to a burst (or flare) of ionizing\nradiation from Sgr A*. We now provide further evidence for a powerful flare\nevent: UV absorption line ratios (in particular CIV/CII, SiIV/SiII) observed by\nthe Hubble Space Telescope reveal that some Stream clouds towards both galactic\npoles are highly ionized by a source capable of producing ionization energies\nup to at least 50 eV.

In this paper, we study a\npractical scenario considering the security issues in the presence of agents\nwith arbitrarily faulty or malicious behavior. Under these circumstances,\nlearning an optimal policy becomes particularly challenging, even in the\nunrealistic case that an agent's policy can be made conditional upon all other\nagents' observations.

Previous theoretical studies have shown\nvarious appealing properties of SGLD, ranging from the convergence properties\nto the generalization bounds. In this paper, we study the properties of SGLD\nfrom a novel perspective of membership privacy protection (i.e., preventing the\nmembership attack). The membership attack, which aims to determine whether a\nspecific sample is used for training a given DNN model, has emerged as a common\nthreat against deep learning algorithms. To this end, we build a theoretical\nframework to analyze the information leakage (w.r.t. the training dataset) of a\nmodel trained using SGLD. Based on this framework, we demonstrate that SGLD can\nprevent the information leakage of the training dataset to a certain extent.\nMoreover, our theoretical analysis can be naturally extended to other types of\nStochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) methods. Empirical\nresults on different datasets and models verify our theoretical findings and\nsuggest that the SGLD algorithm can not only reduce the information leakage but\nalso improve the generalization ability of the DNN models in real-world\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Oct 2019 11:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-08"}

While foraging, the swarm explores the\nenvironment and makes a collective decision on how to exploit the available\nresources, either by selecting a single source or concurrently exploiting more\nthan one. At the same time, the robots locally exchange messages in order to\nagree on how to name each source. Here, we study the correlation between the\ntask-induced interaction network and the emergent naming conventions. In\nparticular, our goal is to determine whether the dynamics of the interaction\nnetwork are sufficient to determine an emergent vocabulary that is potentially\nuseful to the robot swarm. To be useful, linguistic conventions need to be\ncompact and meaningful, that is, to be the minimal description of the relevant\nfeatures of the environment and of the made collective decision.

Testing and\nVerification (T&V) of NN-based control software in safety-critical domains are\ngaining interest and attention from both software engineering and safety\nengineering researchers and practitioners. Objective: With the increase in\nstudies on the T&V of NN-based control software in safety-critical domains, it\nis important to systematically review the state-of-the-art T&V methodologies,\nto classify approaches and tools that are invented, and to identify challenges\nand gaps for future studies. Method: We retrieved 950 papers on the T&V of\nNN-based Safety-Critical Control Software (SCCS). To reach our result, we\nfiltered 83 primary papers published between 2001 and 2018, applied the\nthematic analysis approach for analyzing the data extracted from the selected\npapers, presented the classification of approaches, and identified challenges.\nConclusion: The approaches were categorized into five high-order themes:\nassuring robustness of NNs, assuring safety properties of NN-based control\nsoftware, improving the failure resilience of NNs, measuring and ensuring test\ncompleteness, and improving the interpretability of NNs. From the industry\nperspective, improving the interpretability of NNs is a crucial need in\nsafety-critical applications. We also investigated nine safety integrity\nproperties within four major safety lifecycle phases to investigate the\nachievement level of T&V goals in IEC 61508-3. Results show that correctness,\ncompleteness, freedom from intrinsic faults, and fault tolerance have drawn\nmost attention from the research community.

An important challenge for DFT-based screening is the sensitivity of\nthe predictions to the choice of the exchange correlation function. In this\nwork, we rigorously explore the sensitivity of finite temperature thermodynamic\nproperties to the choice of the exchange correlation functional using the\nbuilt-in error estimation capabilities within the Bayesian Error Estimation\nFunctional. The vibrational properties are estimated using the Debye model and\nwe quantify the uncertainty associated with finite-temperature properties for a\ndiverse collection of materials.

While the\nenergetics generated by BEEF-vdW ensemble is typically normal, the complex\nmapping through the Debye model leads to the derived finite temperature\nproperties having non-Gaussian behavior. We test a wide variety of probability\ndistributions that best represent the finite temperature distribution and find\nthat properties such as specific heat, Gibbs free energy, entropy, and the\nthermal expansion coefficient are well described by normal or transformed\nnormal distributions, while the prediction spread of volume at a given\ntemperature does not appear to be drawn from a single distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2019 22:52:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

Mimicking the classical setting, an abstract convex function is\nthe upper envelope of a family of abstract affine functions (being conventional\nvertical translations of the abstract linear functions). We establish new\nconditions for zero duality gap under no topological assumptions on the space\nof abstract linear functions. In particular, we prove that the zero duality gap\nproperty can be fully characterized in terms of an inclusion involving\n(abstract) $\\varepsilon-$subdifferentials.

In\nthis work, we describe a novel CR-OCT architecture that is free from these\nlimitations. To ensure stable operation, temperature sensitive optical modules\nwithin the system were replaced; the kilometer-length fiber spools used in the\nstretched-pulse mode-locked (SPML) laser was eliminated in favor of a single 10\nmeter, continuously chirped fiber Bragg grating, and the interferometer's\npassive optical quadrature demodulation circuit was replaced by an active\ntechnique using a lithium niobate phase modulator. For improved imaging\npenetration in biological tissues, the system operating wavelength was shifted\nto a center wavelength of 1.29 um by leveraging the wavelength flexibility\nintrinsic to CFBG-based dispersive fibers. These improvements were achieved\nwhile maintaining a broad (100 nm) optical bandwidth, a long 4 cm imaging\nrange, and a high 7.6 MHz A-line rate. By enhancing stability, simplifying\noverall system design, and operating at 1.3 um, this CR-OCT architecture will\nallow a broader exploration of CR-OCT in both medical and non-medical\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2019 16:04:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 19:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-01"}
