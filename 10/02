Our analysis shows that HD~27463 exhibits two types of\nphotometric variability. The low frequency variability with the period $P$\n=~2.834274 $\\pm$ 0.000008 d can be explained in terms of axial stellar rotation\nassuming the oblique magnetic rotator model and presence of surface\nabundance/brightness spots, while the detected high-frequency variations are\ncharacteristics of $\\delta$~Scuti pulsations. From the analysis of Balmer line\nprofiles visible in two FEROS spectra of HD~27463 we have derived its effective\ntemperature and surface gravity, finding values that are close to those\npublished for this star in the \\textit{TESS} Input Catalogue (TIC). Knowing the\nrotation period and the v$\\sin{i}$ value estimated from the fitting of Balmer\nline profiles we found that the rotational axis is inclined to the line of\nsight with an angle of $i=33\\pm8\\deg$. Our best-fitting model of the observed\npulsation modes results in an overshoot parameter value $f_{ov} = 0.014$ and\nvalues of global stellar parameters that are in good agreement with the data\nreported in the TIC and with the data derived from fitting Balmer line\nprofiles.

To tackle the two tasks, deep\nneural networks trained to infer semantic segmentation and depth from stereo\nimages are often the preferred choices.

We\nintroduce the first quantum embedding theory that is also variational, in that\nit is guaranteed to provide a one-sided bound for the exact ground-state\nenergy. Our method, which we call the variational embedding method, provides a\nlower bound for this quantity. The method relaxes the representability\nconditions for quantum marginals to a set of linear and semidefinite\nconstraints that operate at both local and global scales, resulting in a\nsemidefinite program (SDP) to be solved numerically. The accuracy of the method\ncan be systematically improved. The method is versatile and can be applied, in\nparticular, to quantum many-body problems for both quantum spin systems and\nfermionic systems, such as those arising from electronic structure\ncalculations. We describe how the proper notion of quantum marginal,\nsufficiently general to accommodate both of these settings, should be phrased\nin terms of certain algebras of operators.

Spectroscopy of exoplanets is very challenging because of the high\nstar-planet contrast. A technical difficulty in the design of imaging\ninstruments is the noncommon path aberrations (NCPAs) between the adaptive\noptics (AO) sensing and the science camera, which induce planet-resembling\nstellar speckles in the coronagraphic science images. In an observing sequence\nof several long exposures, quickly evolving NCPAs average out and leave behind\nan AO halo that adds photon noise to the planet detection. Static NCPA can be\ncalibrated a posteriori using differential imaging techniques. However, NCPAs\nthat evolve during the observing sequence do not average out and cannot be\ncalibrated a posteriori. These quasi-static NCPAs are one of the main\nlimitations of the current direct imaging instruments such as SPHERE, GPI, and\nSCExAO.\n  Aims. Our aim is to actively minimize the quasi-static speckles induced in\nlong-exposure images. To do so, we need to measure the quasi-static speckle\nfield above the AO halo.\n  Methods. The self-coherent camera (SCC) is a proven technique which measures\nthe speckle complex field in the coronagraphic science images.

All the current known related compounds with straight-chain\nstructures, such as CuCN, AgCN, AuCN and M$_x$M'$_{1-x}$CN (M, M' = Cu, Ag,\nAu), exhibit 1D negative thermal expansion (NTE) along the chains and positive\nthermal expansion (PTE) perpendicular to them.

While convolutional neural networks have\nbrought state of the art accuracies within object detection, errors arise when\nobjects in different classes share similar features. This scenario often occurs\nwhen objects in images are viewed at too small of a scale to discern distinct\ndifferences in features, causing images to be incorrectly classified or\nlocalized. To solve this problem, we will explore using context when\nclassifying image segments. This technique involves feeding a convolutional\nneural network a central square image along with a border of its direct\nsurroundings at train and test times. This means that although images are\nlabelled at a smaller scale to preserve accurate localization, the network\nclassifies the images and learns features that include the wider context. We\ndemonstrate the benefits of this context technique in the object detection task\nthrough a case study of grass (foxtail) and grass-like (yellow nutsedge) weed\ndetection in maize fields. In this standard situation, adding context alone\nnearly halved the error of the neural network from 7.1% to 4.3%.

Using CycleGAN, we learn an image model from low-throughput,\nhigh-resolution images to enhance features, such as microtubule networks in\nhigh-throughput low-resolution images. We show that CycleGAN is effective in\nidentifying microtubules with 0.93+ AUC-ROC and that these results are robust\nto different kinds of image noise. We further apply CycleGAN to quantify the\nchanges in microtubule density as a result of the application of drug\ncompounds, and show that the quantified responses correspond well with known\ndrug effects\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 20:43:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-03"}

In this paper, we\nfocus our attention on a broad class of dynamical systems which are feedback\nlinearizable, and exploit this structure to improve both algorithmic\nreliability and runtime. We showcase our new algorithm in three distinct\ntraffic scenarios, and observe that in practice our method converges\nsignificantly more often and more quickly than was possible without exploiting\nthe feedback linearizable structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 21:34:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 13:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-20"}

However, most RL algorithms struggle to learn in this\nsetting since the learning signal is mostly zeros. In contrast, humans are good\nat assessing and predicting the future consequences of actions and can serve as\ngood reward/policy shapers to accelerate the robot learning process. Previous\nworks have shown that the human brain generates an error-related signal,\nmeasurable using electroencephelography (EEG), when the human perceives the\ntask being done erroneously. In this work, we propose a method that uses\nevaluative feedback obtained from human brain signals measured via scalp EEG to\naccelerate RL for robotic agents in sparse reward settings. As the robot learns\nthe task, the EEG of a human observer watching the robot attempts is recorded\nand decoded into noisy error feedback signal. From this feedback, we use\nsupervised learning to obtain a policy that subsequently augments the behavior\npolicy and guides exploration in the early stages of RL. This bootstraps the RL\nlearning process to enable learning from sparse reward. Using a robotic\nnavigation task as a test bed, we show that our method achieves a stable\nobstacle-avoidance policy with high success rate, outperforming learning from\nsparse rewards only that struggles to achieve obstacle avoidance behavior or\nfails to advance to the goal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 21:34:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 17:37:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

We propose a novel decision\ntechnique that addresses the massive number of decision choices for large-scale\nreal-world problems; in addition, our method also features an experiential\nlearning component that adaptively determines the utilization of the\ncomputational resources based on the performance of a small number of choices.\nOur framework is closed-loop, and naturally incorporates all the attractive\nfeatures of such a decision-making system. In contrast to myopic approaches,\nwhich do not account for the future effects of the current choices, our\nmethodology has an anticipatory learning component that effectively\nincorporates \\emph{lookahead} into the solutions. To this end, we leverage the\ntheory of regression analysis, Markov decision processes (MDPs), multi-armed\nbandits, and stochastic models of community damage from natural disasters to\ndevelop a method for near-optimal recovery of communities. Our method\ncontributes to the general problem of MDPs with massive action spaces with\napplication to recovery of communities affected by hazards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 22:30:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 16:59:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 22:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

In this work we present a family of Bell inequalities which are\nmaximally violated by multiple inequivalent quantum realisations. We completely\ncharacterise the quantum realisations achieving the maximal violation and we\nshow that each of them requires a maximally entangled state of two qubits. This\nimplies the existence of a new, weak form of self-testing in which the maximal\nviolation allows us to identify the state, but does not fully determine the\nmeasurements. From the geometric point of view the set of probability points\nthat saturate the quantum bound is a line segment. We then focus on a\nparticular member of the family and show that the self-testing statement is\nrobust, i.e. that observing a non-maximal violation allows us to make a\nquantitative statement about the unknown state. To achieve this we present a\nnew construction of extraction channels and analyse their performance. For\ncompleteness we provide two independent approaches: analytical and numerical.\nThe noise robustness, i.e. the amount of white noise at which the bound becomes\ntrivial, of the analytical bound is rather small (~0.06%), but the numerical\nmethod takes us into an experimentally-relevant regime (~5%). We conclude by\ninvestigating the amount of randomness that can be certified using these Bell\nviolations.

We aim to\nunderstand the origin of HF emission in the Orion Bar by comparing its spatial\ndistribution with other tracers. We examine three mechanisms to explain the HF\nemission: thermal excitation, radiative dust pumping, and chemical pumping. We\nused a Herschel/HIFI strip map of the HF J = 1-0 line, covering 0.5' by 1.5'\nthat is oriented perpendicular to the Orion Bar. We used the RADEX non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) code to construct the HF column density\nmap. We use the Meudon PDR code to explain the morphology of HF. The bulk of\nthe HF emission at 10 km s^-1 emerges from the CO-dark molecular gas that\nseparates the ionization front from the molecular gas that is deeper in the\nOrion Bar. The excitation of HF is caused mainly by collisions with H2 at a\ndensity of 10^5 cm^-3 together with a small contribution of electrons in the\ninterclump gas of the Orion Bar. Infrared pumping and chemical pumping are not\nimportant. We conclude that the HF J = 1-0 line traces CO-dark molecular gas.\nSimilarly, bright photodissociation regions associated with massive star\nformation may be responsible for the HF emission observed toward active\ngalactic nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 23:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

Every quantum system that interacts with the\nenvironment is doomed to decohere. The preservation of quantum coherence is one\nof the major challenges faced in quantum technologies, but its use as a\nresource is very promising and can lead to various operational advantages, for\nexample in quantum algorithms. Hence, much work has been devoted in recent\nyears to quantify the coherence present in a system. In the present paper, we\nformulate the quantum resource theory of dynamical coherence. The underlying\nphysical principle we follow is that the free dynamical objects are those that\ncannot preserve or distribute coherence. This leads us to identify classical\nchannels as the free elements in this theory. Consequently, even the quantum\nidentity channel is not free as all physical systems undergo decoherence and\nhence, the preservation of coherence should be considered a resource. In our\nwork, we introduce four different types of free superchannels (analogous to\nMIO, DIO, IO, and SIO) and discuss in detail two of them, namely,\ndephasing-covariant incoherent superchannels (DISC), maximally incoherent\nsuperchannels (MISC). The latter consists of all superchannels that do not\ngenerate non-classical channels from classical ones. We quantify dynamical\ncoherence using channel-divergence-based monotones for MISC and DISC. We show\nthat some of these monotones have operational interpretations as the exact, the\napproximate, and the liberal coherence cost of a quantum channel. Moreover, we\nprove that the liberal asymptotic cost of a channel is equal to a new type of\nregularized relative entropy. Finally, we show that the conversion distance\nbetween two channels under MISC and DISC can be computed using a semi-definite\nprogram (SDP).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 23:05:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 06:24:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 04:58:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 15:53:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

In this paper we propose a new neural network\nmodel architecture, namely multi-stream self-attention, to address the issue\nthus make the self-attention mechanism more effective for speech recognition.\nThe proposed model architecture consists of parallel streams of self-attention\nencoders, and each stream has layers of 1D convolutions with dilated kernels\nwhose dilation rates are unique given stream, followed by a self-attention\nlayer. The self-attention mechanism in each stream pays attention to only one\nresolution of input speech frames and the attentive computation can be more\nefficient. In a later stage, outputs from all the streams are concatenated then\nlinearly projected to the final embedding. By stacking the proposed\nmulti-stream self-attention encoder blocks and rescoring the resultant lattices\nwith neural network language models, we achieve the word error rate of 2.2% on\nthe test-clean dataset of the LibriSpeech corpus, the best number reported thus\nfar on the dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 23:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-03"}

However, this typically involves a complex process flow,\nstringent requirements for an ultra high vacuum environment, long fabrication\ntimes and, consequently, limited throughput and device yield. Here, a device\nplatform is developed that overcomes these limitations by integrating scanning\nprobe based dopant device fabrication with a CMOS-compatible process flow.\nSilicon on insulator substrates are used featuring a reconstructed Si(001):H\nsurface that is protected by a capping chip and has pre-implanted contacts\nready for scanning tunneling microscope (STM) patterning. Processing in\nultra-high vacuum is thus reduced to only a few critical steps which minimizes\nthe complexity, time and effort required for fabrication of the nanoscale\ndopant devices. Subsequent reintegration of the samples into the CMOS process\nflow not only simplifies the post-processing but also opens the door to\nsuccessful application of STM based dopant devices as a building block in more\ncomplex device architectures.

A lot of real-life recognition applications\nrequire a rich output structure with deterministic constraints that are\ndiscrete or modeled by a non-differentiable function. A prime example is\nrecognizing digit sequences, which are restricted by such rules (e.g.,\n\\textit{container code detection}, \\textit{social insurance number\nrecognition}, etc.). We investigate the usefulness of adding non-differentiable\nconstraints in learning for the task of digit sequence recognition. Toward this\ngoal, we synthesize six different datasets from MNIST and Cropped SVHN, with\nthree discrete rules inspired by real-life protocols. To deal with the\nnon-differentiability of these rules, we propose a reinforcement learning\napproach based on the policy gradient method. We find that incorporating this\nrule-based reinforcement can effectively increase the accuracy for all datasets\nand provide a good inductive bias which improves the model even with limited\ndata. On one of the datasets, MNIST\\_Rule2, models trained with rule-based\nreinforcement increase the accuracy by 4.7\\% for 2000 samples and 23.6\\% for\n500 samples.

In this paper, starting from Ourivski and Johansson's\nalgebraic modelling of the problem into a system of polynomial equations, we\nshow how to augment this system with easily computed equations so that the\naugmented system is solved much faster via Groebner bases. This happens because\nthe augmented system has solving degree $r$, $r+1$ or $r+2$ depending on the\nparameters, where $r$ is the rank weight, which we show by extending results\nfrom Verbel et al. (PQCrypto 2019) on systems arising from the MinRank problem;\nwith target rank $r$, Verbel et al. lower the solving degree to $r+2$, and even\nless for some favorable instances that they call superdetermined. We give\ncomplexity bounds for this approach as well as practical timings of an\nimplementation using Magma.

In\nthe SetIntersection variant, all the elements in the intersection of the query\nsets are required to be reported. These are two fundamental problems that were\nconsidered in several papers from both the upper bound and lower bound\nperspective.\n  Several conditional lower bounds for these problems were proven for the\ntradeoff between preprocessing and query time or the tradeoff between space and\nquery time. Moreover, there are several unconditional hardness results for\nthese problems in some specific computational models. The fundamental nature of\nthe SetDisjointness and SetIntersection problems makes them useful for proving\nthe conditional hardness of other problems from various areas. However, the\nuniverse of the elements in the sets may be very large, which may cause the\nreduction to some other problems to be inefficient and therefore it is not\nuseful for proving their conditional hardness.\n  In this paper, we prove the conditional hardness of SetDisjointness and\nSetIntersection with bounded universe.

When crowded,\nionic microgels deswell owing to a redistribution of microions inside and\noutside the particles. The concentration-dependent deswelling affects the\ninteractions between the microgels, and consequently the suspension properties.\nWe present a comprehensive theoretical study of crowding effects on\nthermodynamic, structural, and dynamic properties of weakly cross-linked ionic\nmicrogels in a good solvent. The microgels are modeled as microion- and\nsolvent-permeable colloidal spheres with fixed charge uniformly distributed\nover the polymer gel backbone, whose elastic and solvent-interaction free\nenergies are described using Flory-Rehner theory. Two mean-field methods for\ncalculating the crowding-dependent microgel radius are investigated, and\ncombined with calculations of the net microgel charge characterizing the\nelectrostatic part of an effective microgel pair potential, with charge\nrenormalization accounted for. Using this effective pair potential,\nthermodynamic and static suspension properties are calculated including the\nosmotic pressure and microgel pair distribution function. The latter is used in\nour calculations of dynamic suspension properties, where we account for\nhydrodynamic interactions. Results for diffusion and rheological properties are\npresented over ranges of microgel concentration and charge. We show that\ndeswelling mildly enhances self- and collective diffusion and the osmotic\npressure, lowers the suspension viscosity, and significantly shifts the\nsuspension crystallization point to higher concentrations.

Luckily, there exist theoretical remedies for\nthese issues which have been successfully tested in practice for cases of well\ndefined discontinuities. We focus on one piece of this procedure---detecting a\ndiscontinuity in spectral data. We show that realistic applications require\ntreatment of discontinuities dynamically developing in time and that it poses\nchallenges associated with shock detection. More precisely, smoothly steepening\ngradients in the solution spawn spurious oscillations due to insufficient\nresolution, causing premature shock identification and information loss.

We analyse both the skill and\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the Integrated Forecast System (IFS), the European\nCenter for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model, in an ensemble\nhindcast experiment. Specifically, we examine the contribution to both from the\nregime dynamics of the North Atlantic eddy-driven jet. This is done by\nconstructing a statistical model which captures the predictability inherent to\nto the trimodal jet latitude system, and fitting its parameters to reanalysis\nand IFS data. Predictability in this regime system is driven by interannual\nvariations in the persistence of the jet latitude regimes, which determine the\npreferred state of the jet. We show that the IFS has skill at predicting such\nvariations in persistence: because the position of the jet strongly influences\nthe NAO, this automatically generates skill at predicting the NAO. We show that\nall of the skill the IFS has at predicting the winter NAO over the period\n1980-2010 can be attributed to its skill at predicting regime persistence in\nthis way. Similarly, the tendency of the IFS to underestimate regime\npersistence can account for the low signal-to-noise ratio, giving a possible\nexplanation for the signal-to-noise paradox.

In the context of programming languages, there exist two\ncommon approaches for establishing non-interference: type systems and program\nlogics.

Program\nlogics support challenging programs, but they typically require significant\nhuman assistance, and cannot handle modules or higher-order programs.\n  To connect these two approaches, we present SeLoC---a separation logic for\nnon-interference, on top of which we build a type system using the technique of\nlogical relations. By building a type system on top of separation logic, we can\ncompositionally verify programs that consist of typed and untyped parts. The\nformer parts are verified through type checking, while the latter parts are\nverified through manual proof.\n  The core technical contribution of SeLoC is a relational form of weakest\npreconditions that can track information flow using separation logic resources.\nSeLoC is fully machine-checked, and built on top of the Iris framework for\nconcurrent separation logic in Coq.

Indeed, out of $\\sim100$ extragalactic sources detected\nat $E>100$ GeV, only six are radio galaxies. The new Cherenkov Telescope Array\n(CTA) will provide order-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity with respect\nto the present generation of ground-based $\\gamma$-ray observatories, opening\nnew frontiers for high-energy studies of radio galaxies. In a previous paper,\nwe studied the CTA detection prospects of misaligned jets from the Third\nFermi-LAT catalog (3FGL) sample. In this work, we take advantage of the\nexpanded sample from the Fourth Fermi-LAT catalog (4FGL), including roughly\ndouble the number of sources. We simulate CTA observations of 41 $\\gamma$-ray\nradio galaxies, extrapolating their GeV spectrum into the TeV range assuming\ndifferent spectral shapes. We predict that the CTA will detect eleven new TeV\nradio galaxies with an observational campaign of 50 hours per source, under the\nrealistic assumption of a spectral cutoff at 0.5 TeV. This would increase the\nsample of VHE radio galaxies by a factor of three, and result in the first\ndetection of FR II radio galaxies at these energies. By simulating CTA\nobservations with 5 hours exposure, we predict that two Fermi-LAT radio\ngalaxies should already be within reach of current TeV observatories.

Using in-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we image\na thermally driven reversible transition in\nLa$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$CoO$_{3-\\delta}$ films on SrTiO$_3$ from a multidomain\nbrownmillerite (BM) structure to a uniform phase wherein oxygen vacancies order\nin every third CoO$_x$ plane.

Premet conjectured that the variety of nilpotent\nelements of any finite dimensional restricted Lie algebra over an algebraically\nclosed field of characteristic $p>0$ is irreducible. This conjecture remains\nopen, but it is known to hold for a large class of simple restricted Lie\nalgebras, e.g. for Lie algebras of connected algebraic groups, and for Cartan\nseries $W, S$ and $H$.\n  In this thesis we start by proving that Premet's conjecture can be reduced to\nthe semisimple case. The proof is straightforward. However, the reduction of\nthe semisimple case to the simple case is very non-trivial in prime\ncharacteristic as semisimple Lie algebras are not always direct sums of simple\nideals. Then we consider some semisimple restricted Lie algebras. Under the\nassumption that $p>2$, we prove that Premet's conjecture holds for the\nsemisimple restricted Lie algebra whose socle involves the special linear Lie\nalgebra $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$ tensored by the truncated polynomial ring\n$k[X]/(X^{p})$. Then we extend this example to the semisimple restricted Lie\nalgebra whose socle involves $S\\otimes \\mathcal{O}(m; \\underline{1})$, where\n$S$ is any simple restricted Lie algebra such that $\\text{ad} S=\\text{Der} S$\nand its nilpotent variety $\\mathcal{N}(S)$ is irreducible, and $\\mathcal{O}(m;\n\\underline{1})=k[X_1, \\dots, X_m]/(X_1^p, \\dots, X_m^p)$ is the truncated\npolynomial ring in $m\\geq 2$ variables.\n  In the final chapter we assume that $p>3$. We confirm Premet's conjecture for\nthe minimal $p$-envelope $W(1; n)_{p}$ of the Zassenhaus algebra $W(1; n)$ for\nall $n\\geq 2$.

An RIS can manipulate the properties of an\nincident wave, such as the frequency, amplitude, and phase, and, then, reflect\nthis manipulated wave to a desired destination, without the need for complex\nsignal processing. In this paper, the asymptotic optimality of achievable rate\nin a downlink RIS system is analyzed under a practical RIS environment with its\nassociated limitations. In particular, a passive beamformer that can achieve\nthe asymptotic optimal performance by controlling the incident wave properties\nis designed, under a limited RIS control link and practical reflection\ncoefficients. In order to increase the achievable system sum-rate, a modulation\nscheme that can be used in an RIS without interfering with existing users is\nproposed and its average symbol error ratio is asymptotically derived.\nMoreover, a new resource allocation algorithm that jointly considers user\nscheduling and power control is designed, under consideration of the proposed\npassive beamforming and modulation schemes.

In-plane skyrmion\ndynamics triggered by spin-orbit torques are also investigated analytically and\nnumerically. Our findings point towards the possibility of designing racetracks\nfor in-plane skyrmions, whose speed could be tuned by adjusting the angle\nbetween the charge current and the uniform background magnetization; in\nparticular, the speed is maximum for currents parallel to the easy axis and\nbecomes zero for currents transverse to it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 14:46:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 13:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

Current methods to assess fetal pH and\nacid-base status are invasive and carry significant maternal and fetal risks.\nGiven these limitations, obstetrical care providers developed the electronic\nfetal monitoring (EFM) system, a non-invasive tool, which evaluates\nbeat-to-beat fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns in order to predict fetal\noxygenation status in real-time. Every year, about 85 percent of the\napproximately 4 million live births in the United States are evaluated using\nEFM. Unfortunately, though there is ample physiological evidence that FHR\npatterns are inextricably linked to fetal acid-base status, the use of EFM has\nnot been shown to reliably predict neonatal pH, nor has it reduced the\nincidence of adverse perinatal outcomes, including long-term neurological\nmorbidity and cerebral palsy (CP). The poor specificity associated with the\ncurrent interpretation of the EFM therefore leads to a paradox we have\nhenceforth defined as the Obstetrical Paradox.

Most\nexisting indoor intrusion detection methods directly exploit the Received\nSignal Strength (RSS) data collected by Monitor Points (MPs) and do not\nconsider the instability of WLAN signals in the complex indoor environments. In\nresponse to this urgent problem, this paper proposes a novel WLAN indoor\nintrusion detection method based on deep signal feature fusion and Minimized\nMultiple Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (Minimized-MKMMD). Firstly, the\nmulti-branch deep convolutional neural network is used to conduct the\ndimensionality reduction and feature fusion of the RSS data, and the tags are\nobtained according to the features of the offline and online RSS fusion\nfeatures that are corresponding to the silence and intrusion states, and then\nbased on this, the source domain and target domain are constructed\nrespectively. Secondly, the optimal transfer matrix is constructed by\nminimizing MKMMD. Thirdly, the transferred RSS data in the source domain is\nutilized for training the classifiers that are applying in getting the\nclassification of the RSS fusion features in the target domain in the same\nshared subspace. Finally, the intrusion detection of the target environment is\nrealized by iteratively updating the process above until the algorithm\nconverges. The experimental results show that the proposed method can\neffectively improve the accuracy and robustness of the intrusion detection\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 13:01:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-07"}

The\nUE is then instructed by the base station (BS) to measure the quality of\ncandidate bands, which requires a measurement gap in the data transmission,\nthus lowering the data rate. We propose an online-learning based band switching\napproach that does not require any measurement gap. Our proposed\nclassifier-based band switching policy instead exploits spatial and spectral\ncorrelation between radio frequency signals in different bands based on\nknowledge of the UE location. We focus on switching between a lower (e.g., 3.5\nGHz) band and a millimeter wave band (e.g., 28 GHz), and design and evaluate\ntwo classification models that are trained on a ray-tracing dataset. A key\ninsight is that measurement gaps are overkill, in that only the relative order\nof the bands is necessary for band selection, rather than a full channel\nestimate. Our proposed machine learning based policies achieve roughly 30%\nimprovement in mean effective rates over those of the industry standard policy,\nwhile achieving misclassification errors well below 0.5% and maintaining\nresilience against blockage uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 14:44:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2020 16:47:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 19:08:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 14:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

Optimizing these\nsettings by grid or random search is computationally expensive because it\nrequires many training runs. In this paper, we incorporate architecture search\ninto a single training run through auto-sizing, which uses regularization to\ndelete neurons in a network over the course of training. On very low-resource\nlanguage pairs, we show that auto-sizing can improve BLEU scores by up to 3.9\npoints while removing one-third of the parameters from the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 19:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

This is particularly the case for dialogue systems,\nwhere we want to be able to seamlessly include new domains into the\nconversation. Therefore, it is crucial for generation models to share knowledge\nacross domains for the effective adaptation from one domain to another. In this\nstudy, we exploit a tree-structured semantic encoder to capture the internal\nstructure of complex semantic representations required for multi-domain\ndialogues in order to facilitate knowledge sharing across domains. In addition,\na layer-wise attention mechanism between the tree encoder and the decoder is\nadopted to further improve the model's capability. The automatic evaluation\nresults show that our model outperforms previous methods in terms of the BLEU\nscore and the slot error rate, in particular when the adaptation data is\nlimited. In subjective evaluation, human judges tend to prefer the sentences\ngenerated by our model, rating them more highly on informativeness and\nnaturalness than other systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 14:27:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

It is assumed within the framework of this model that an\nencounter of an atom (or ion) with the surface is a series of elastic (in the\ndirection normal to the surface) hits of the atom against surface\npseudoparticles, the hits instantly following each other. To each atom, one\nassigns two infinite sequences of masses of pseudoparticles. The model is a\nfar-reaching generalization of the well-known hard cube model. Criteria for\nboth finiteness and infinity of series of hits are formulated, based on the\nmasses of pseudoparticles and the mass of the atom. It is shown that in\nvirtually all the cases, any number of hits in a series occurs with a positive\nprobability.
