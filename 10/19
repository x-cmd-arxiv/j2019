The network leverages\nknowledge-based, context-aware conceptualizations to derive an extended set of\ncandidate concepts.

However, it is quite\nchallenging to develop a federated learning algorithm that can address both\nprivacy-preserving and class imbalanced issues. In this study, we introduce a\nfederated generative model learning platform for generating samples in a\ndata-distributed environment while preserving privacy.

This paper develops an optimization\nhierarchy, which is a sequence of optimization problems with an increasing\nnumber of constraints, for fair statistical decision problems. Because our\nhierarchy is based on the framework of statistical decision problems, this\nmeans it provides a systematic approach for developing and studying fair\nversions of hypothesis testing, decision-making, estimation, regression, and\nclassification. We use the insight that qualitative definitions of fairness are\nequivalent to statistical independence between the output of a statistical\ntechnique and a random variable that measures attributes for which fairness is\ndesired. We use this insight to construct an optimization hierarchy that lends\nitself to numerical computation, and we use tools from variational analysis and\nrandom set theory to prove that higher levels of this hierarchy lead to\nconsistency in the sense that it asymptotically imposes this independence as a\nconstraint in corresponding statistical decision problems.

The strategy allows for up to three\nblinding stages, where the data may be blinded, the computations of theoretical\nphysics may be blinded, and --assuming Gaussianly distributed data-- the\ncovariance matrix may be blinded. We found covariance blinding to be\nparticularly effective, as it enables the blinder to determine close to exactly\nwhere the blinded posterior will peak. Accordingly, we present an algorithm\nwhich induces posterior shifts in predetermined directions by hiding\nuntraceable biases in a covariance matrix. The associated deblinding takes the\nform of a numerically lightweight post-processing step, where the blinded\nposterior is multiplied with deblinding weights. We illustrate the blinding\nstrategy for cosmic shear from KiDS-450, and show that even though there is no\ndirect evidence of the KiDS-450 covariance matrix being biased, the famous\ncosmic shear tension with Planck could easily be induced by a\nmischaracterization of correlations between $\\xi_-$ at the highest redshift and\nall lower redshifts. The blinding algorithm illustrates the increasing\nimportance of accurate uncertainty assessment in astronomical inferences, as\notherwise involuntary blinding through biases occurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 17:59:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

This degeneracy between dark matter\nproperties and the thermal history vastly widens the field of viable dark\nmatter candidates, undermining efforts to constrain dark matter's identity.\nFortunately, an early matter-dominated era also amplifies density fluctuations\nat small scales and leads to early microhalo formation, boosting the dark\nmatter annihilation rate and bringing smaller cross sections into the view of\nexisting indirect-detection probes.

The MST has been used in a broad range of scientific fields such as\nparticle physics (to distinguish classes of events in collider collisions), in\nastronomy (to detect mass segregation in star clusters) and cosmology (to\nsearch for filaments in the cosmic web). Its success in these fields has been\ndriven by its sensitivity to the spatial distribution of points and the\npatterns within. MiSTree, a public Python package, allows a user to construct\nthe MST in a variety of coordinates systems, including Celestial coordinates\nused in astronomy. The package enables the MST to be constructed quickly by\ninitially using a k-nearest neighbour graph (kNN, rather than a matrix of\npairwise distances) which is then fed to Kruskal's algorithm to construct the\nMST. MiSTree enables a user to measure the statistics of the MST and provides\nclasses for binning the MST statistics (into histograms) and plotting the\ndistributions. Applying the MST will enable the inclusion of high-order\nstatistics information from the cosmic web which can provide additional\ninformation to improve cosmological parameter constraints. This information has\nnot been fully exploited due to the computational cost of calculating N-point\nstatistics.

The main objective is to explain the\nbright, hard state observations of accreting systems with stellar-mass to\nsupermassive BHs. We include the effects of magnetic fields and radiation\ncounterpart in entropy gradient based on the first law of thermodynamics to\nrepresent energy advection. The cooling process includes bremsstrahlung,\nsynchrotron radiation, and inverse Comptonization process. One of our main\nventures is to explain some long-standing issues of ultra-luminous X-ray\nsources (ULXs). The existing physical scenarios to explain their unusual high\nluminosity are either the existence of the missing class of intermediate-mass\nBH (IMBH), or super-Eddington accretion around a stellar-mass BH. However, most\nULXs with steep power-law spectrum can be well explained through\nsuper-Eddington accretion, while the existence of IMBH is indeed disputed\nextensively. Nevertheless, the interpretation of ULXs with a hard power-law\ndominated state remains mysterious. Here we show that our magnetically\ndominated disc-outflow symbiosis around rapidly spinning stellar-mass BHs can\nachieve such large luminosity even for sub-Eddington accretion rate. The\nmagnetic field at the outer zone of the advective flow is more than the\ncorresponding Eddington limit. Such field becomes dynamically dominant near the\nBH through continuous accretion process due to flux freezing, but maintaining\nits Eddington limit. This unique field configurations enhance the synchrotron,\nand synchrotron self-Comptonization process to achieve very large luminosity.\nThrough the same mechanism, our solutions for supermassive BHs can explain the\nunusual large luminosity of ultra-luminous quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 18:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 21:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

Current models, however, fail to reproduce a subset of the observed\ntransition discs, namely objects with large measured cavities and vigorous\naccretion.

In our work we explore the possibility of\nX-ray photoevaporation operating in discs with different gas-phase depletion of\ncarbon and show that the influence of photoevaporation can be extended in such\nlow-metallicity discs. As carbon is one of the main contributors to the X-ray\nopacity, its depletion leads to larger penetration depths of X-rays in the disc\nand results in higher gas temperatures and stronger photoevaporative winds. We\npresent radiation-hydrodynamical models of discs irradiated by internal\nX-ray+EUV radiation assuming Carbon gas-phase depletions by factors of 3,10 and\n100 and derive realistic mass-loss rates and profiles.

Here\nwe report our studies on BaCo2(AsO4)2, for which we find that the magnetic\norder associated with the non-Kitaev interactions can be fully suppressed by a\nrelatively low magnetic field, yielding a non-magnetic material and implying\nthe presence of strong magnetic frustration and weak non-Kitaev interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 18:20:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that deep ReLU networks generalize from training samples to new\npoints via piece-wise linear interpolation.

Second, we regress alternative measures of\nvulnerability on three levels of topological measures: the global level (i.e.\nfirm topological characteristics computed over the whole system), local level\n(i.e. firm topological characteristics computed over the community) and\naggregated level by averaging individual characteristics over the community.\nThe sample includes $46$ financial institutions (banks, broker-dealers,\ninsurance and real-estate companies) listed in the Standard \\& Poor's 500\nindex. Our results confirm the informational content of topological metrics\nbased on close-peer environment. Such information is different from the one\nembeds in traditional system wide topological metrics and is proved to be\npredictor of distress for financial institutions in time of crisis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 20:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

This method\nuses a different hybridization compared to the space-time hybridized\ndiscontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method we presented previously in (Int. J. Numer.\nMeth. Fluids 89: 519--532, 2019). In the space-time EHDG method the velocity\ntrace unknown is continuous while the pressure trace unknown is discontinuous\nacross facets. In the space-time HDG method, all trace unknowns are\ndiscontinuous across facets. Alternatively, we present also a space-time\nembedded discontinuous Galerkin (EDG) method in which all trace unknowns are\ncontinuous across facets. The advantage of continuous trace unknowns is that\nthe formulation has fewer global degrees-of-freedom for a given mesh than when\nusing discontinuous trace unknowns. Nevertheless, the discrete velocity field\nobtained by the space-time EHDG and EDG methods, like the space-time HDG\nmethod, is exactly divergence-free, even on moving domains. However, only the\nspace-time EHDG and HDG methods result in divergence-conforming velocity\nfields. An immediate consequence of this is that the space-time EHDG and HDG\ndiscretizations of the conservative form of the Navier--Stokes equations are\nenergy stable. The space-time EDG method, on the other hand, requires a\nskew-symmetric formulation of the momentum advection term to be energy-stable.\nNumerical examples will demonstrate the differences in solution obtained by the\nspace-time EHDG, EDG, and HDG methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 20:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

However, it is widely acknowledged that substantial contact resistance\nassociated with the contact-TMD interface has impeded device performance to a\nlarge extent. It has been discovered that O2 plasma treatment can convert WSe2\ninto WO3-x and substantially improve contact resistances of p-type WSe2 devices\nby strong doping induced thinner depletion width. In this paper, we carefully\nstudy the temperature dependence of this conversion, demonstrating an oxidation\nprocess with a precise monolayer control at room temperature and multilayer\nconversion at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the lateral oxidation of WSe2\nunder the contact revealed by HR-STEM leads to potential unpinning of the metal\nFermi level and Schottky barrier lowering, resulting in lower contact\nresistances. The p-doping effect is attributed to the high electron affinity of\nthe formed WO3-x layer on top of the remaining WSe2 channel, and the doping\nlevel is found to be dependent on the WO3-x thickness that is controlled by the\ntemperature.

Our connection lays the groundwork towards a\nbetter and deeper understanding of both UC and RC, and the benefits we showcase\nfrom this connection provide first evidence of scalable mechanised proofs for\nUC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 21:28:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 16:59:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 18:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

In addition, it is difficult to follow the recent\nprogress concretely as there is a lack of consistency in benchmark datasets and\ntask definitions in the field of Genomics. To address the aforementioned\nissues, we provide a clinical Meta-Dataset derived from the publicly available\ndata hub called The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) that contains 174 tasks.\nWe believe those tasks could be good proxy tasks to develop methods which can\nwork on a few samples of gene expression data. Also, learning to predict\nmultiple clinical variables using gene-expression data is an important task due\nto the variety of phenotypes in clinical problems and lack of samples for some\nof the rare variables. The defined tasks cover a wide range of clinical\nproblems including predicting tumor tissue site, white cell count, histological\ntype, family history of cancer, gender, and many others which we explain later\nin the paper. Each task represents an independent dataset.

Selecting the nearest neighbor pair spins as an open\nquantum system, the rest of the chain plays the role of the structured\nenvironment. In fact, the aforementioned system is used as a quantum probe\nsignifying nontrivial features of the environment with which is interacting. We\nuse a general measure that is based on the trace distance for the degree of\nnon-Markovian behavior in open quantum systems. The witness of non-Markovianity\ntakes on nonzero values whenever there is a flow of information from the\nenvironment back to the open system. We have shown that the dynamics of the\nsystem with isotropic Heisenberg interaction is Markovian. A dynamical\ntransition into the non-Markovian regime is observed as soon as the anisotropy,\n{\\gamma}, is applied. At the Ising value of the anisotropy {\\gamma} = 1.0, all\nthe information flows back from the environment to the system. The additional\ndynamical transition from the non-Markovian to the Markovian is obtained by\napplying the transverse magnetic field.

It is thus expected that the order parameter of AFM should always\nalign along the easy-axis of the crystalline anisotropy. In contrast to this\nconventional wisdom, we find that the AFM order parameter switches away from\nthe easy-axis below a critical anisotropy strength when an AFM is properly\ntailored into a nano-structure. The switching time first decreases and then\nincreases with the damping. Above the critical anisotropy, the AFM order\nparameter is stable and precesses under a microwave excitation. However, the\nabsorption peak is not at resonance frequency even for magnetic damping as low\nas 0.01. To resolve these anomalies, we first ascertain the hidden role of\ndipolar interaction that reconstructs the energy landscape of the nano-system\nand propose a model of damped non-linear pendulum to explain the switching\nbehavior. In this framework, the second anomaly appears when an AFM is close to\nthe boundary between underdamped and overdamped phases, where the observed\nabsorption lineshape has small quality factor and thus is not reliable any\nlonger.

In globally\nhomogeneous space topologically induced velocity dispersion of a charged\nparticle is the same regardless of the particle's position, whereas in globally\ninhomogeneous the time-evolution of the velocity depends on the particle's\nposition.

This requires performing a spectroscopic analysis of the\npost-merger signal and resolving the frequencies of either different angular\nmodes or overtones (of the same angular mode). For a nearly-equal mass binary\nblack-hole system, only the dominant angular mode ($l=m=2$) is sufficiently\nexcited and the overtones are instrumental to perform this test. Here we\ninvestigate the robustness of modelling the post-merger signal of a binary\nblack hole coalescence as a superposition of overtones. Further, we study the\nbias expected in the recovered frequencies as a function of the start time of a\nspectroscopic analysis and provide a computationally cheap procedure to choose\nit based on the interplay between the expected statistical error due to the\ndetector noise and the systematic errors due to waveform modelling.

Reflecting that variance of the late\nreverberation is time-varying and it depends on past speech source variance,\nthe proposed model is defined as convolution of a speech source variance with a\nmulti-channel time-invariant covariance matrix of late reverberation. The\nmulti-channel time-invariant covariance matrix can be interpreted as a\ncovariance matrix of a multi-channel acoustic transfer function (ATF). An\nadvantageous point of the covariance matrix model against a deterministic ATF\nmodel is that the covariance matrix model is robust against fluctuation of the\nATF. We propose two covariance matrix models. The first model is a covariance\nmatrix model of late reverberation in the original microphone input signal.

However, the pixel-wise error ignores the strong\ndependencies among the pixels in an image, which limits the performance of the\nmodel. Several ways to incorporate the structure information of the objects\nhave been investigated, \\eg, conditional random fields (CRF), image structure\npriors based methods, and generative adversarial network (GAN). Nevertheless,\nthese methods usually require extra model branches or additional memories, and\nsome of them show limited improvements.

Inspired by the widely-used structural similarity (SSIM)\nindex in image quality assessment, we use the linear correlation between two\nimages to quantify their structural similarity. And the goal of the proposed\nSSL is to pay more attention to the positions, whose associated predictions\nlead to a low degree of linear correlation between two corresponding regions in\nthe ground truth map and the predicted map. Thus the model can achieve a strong\nstructural similarity between the two maps through minimizing the SSL over the\nwhole map.

With slight modification, we also propose a\nrobust graph projection splitting (RGPS) method to stabilize the iteration for\nnoisy measurements. Contrary to intuition, RGPS outperforms GPS with fewer\niterations to locate a satisfying solution even for noiseless case. Based on\nthe connection between GPS and Douglas-Rachford iteration, under mild\nconditions on the sampling vectors, we analyze the fixed point sets and provide\nthe local convergence of GPS and RGPS applied to noiseless phase retrieval\nwithout prior information. For noisy case, we provide the error bound of the\nreconstruction. Compared to other existing methods, thanks for the splitting\napproach, GPS and RGPS can efficiently solve phase retrieval with prior\ninformation regularization for general sampling vectors which are not\nnecessarily isometric. For Gaussian phase retrieval, compared to existing\ngradient flow approaches, numerical results show that GPS and RGPS are much\nless sensitive to the initialization. Thus they markedly improve the phase\ntransition in noiseless case and reconstruction in the presence of noise\nrespectively. GPS shows sharpest phase transition among existing methods\nincluding RGPS, while it needs more iterations than RGPS when the number of\nmeasurement is large enough.

Secondly, in order to alleviate the \"energy-hole problem\", the\nnetwork is divided into several annuluses with the same width. Then, another\ntype of virtual force, named \"virtual gravity generated by annulus\", is\nproposed to further optimize the positions of nodes in each annulus. Finally,\nwith the help of the \"data forwarding area\", the optimal paths for data\nuploading can be selected out, which effectively balances energy consumption of\nnodes.

Local\ndecodability in index coding is known to reduce receiver complexity, improve\nuser privacy and decrease decoding error probability in wireless fading\nchannels. Conventional index coding solutions assume that the receivers observe\nthe entire codeword, and as a result, for these codes the number of codeword\nsymbols queried by a user per decoded message symbol, which we refer to as\nlocality, could be large. In this paper, we pose the index coding problem as\nthat of minimizing the broadcast rate for a given value of locality (or vice\nversa) and designing codes that achieve the optimal trade-off between locality\nand rate. We identify the optimal broadcast rate corresponding to the minimum\npossible value of locality for all single unicast problems.

We also identify\nthe optimal trade-off among all codes, including non-linear codes, when the\nside information graph is a directed 3-cycle.

The method is based\non two empirical autoregression models of noise dynamics. The first (rough)\nprediction model is based on radar measurements of daily minimal noise dynamics\naveraged over 28-days with specially calculated weight coefficients. The second\n(fine) prediction model uses real-time scaling of rough model. The scaling is\nbased on the comparison of this model with the experimental noise observations\nduring previous 5 days. The models are based on the whole EKB ISTP SB RAS radar\ndataset (2013-2018). The rough model allows one to estimate the boundary beyond\nwhich the noise variations can be associated with absorption periods with a\nhigh degree of certainty. A joint analysis of simultaneous data on neighboring\nradar beams and at several frequencies reduces the detection errors, and allows\nto identify absorption events with a higher degree of confidence. Use of fine\nmodel allows to estimate absorption. The technique is validated by frequency\ndependence of absorption during two-frequency measurements. The found frequency\ndependence has an average exponent of the order of -1.5, which is in good\nagreement with the literature data and the data obtained earlier in analysis of\nsolar X-ray flares. The use of the detection technique at EKB radar shows that\nmost probable absorption over absorption events is about -0.65dB.

The security of key generation relies on spatial\ndecorrelation, which assumes that eavesdroppers observe uncorrelated channel\nmeasurements when they are located over a half-wavelength away from legitimate\nusers. Unfortunately, there is no experimental validation for communications\nenvironments when there are large-scale and small-scale fading effects.\nFurthermore, while the current key generation work mainly focuses on\nshort-range communications techniques such as WiFi and ZigBee, the exploration\nwith long-range communications, e.g., LoRa, is rather limited. This paper\npresents a LoRa-based key generation testbed and reveals a new\ncolluding-eavesdropping attack that perceives and utilizes large-scale fading\neffects in key generation channels, by using multiple eavesdroppers circularly\naround a legitimate user. We formalized the attack and validated it through\nextensive experiments conducted under both indoor and outdoor environments.

How to integrate object location in both thing and stuff\nsegmentation is a crucial problem. In this paper, we propose spatial\ninformation flows to achieve this objective. The flows can bridge all sub-tasks\nin panoptic segmentation by delivering the object's spatial context from the\nbox regression task to others. More importantly, we design four parallel\nsub-networks to get a preferable adaptation of object spatial information in\nsub-tasks. Upon the sub-networks and the flows, we present a location-aware and\nunified framework for panoptic segmentation, denoted as SpatialFlow. We perform\na detailed ablation study on each component and conduct extensive experiments\nto prove the effectiveness of SpatialFlow. Furthermore, we achieve\nstate-of-the-art results, which are $47.9$ PQ and $62.5$ PQ respectively on\nMS-COCO and Cityscapes panoptic benchmarks.

This paper presents a fuzzy parallel cascades (FPC) model for\npredicting the continuous subjective appraisal of the emotional content of\nmusic by time-varying spectral content of EEG signals. The EEG, along with an\nemotional appraisal of 15 subjects, was recorded during listening to seven\nmusical excerpts. The emotional appraisement was recorded along the valence and\narousal emotional axes as a continuous signal. The FPC model was composed of\nparallel cascades with each cascade containing a fuzzy logic-based system. The\nFPC model performance was evaluated by comparing with linear regression (LR),\nsupport vector regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory recurrent neural\nnetwork (LSTM RNN) models. The RMSE of the FPC was lower than other models for\nthe estimation of both valence and arousal of all musical excerpts.

But this smart material is still\nimmature, and one of the reasons that lead to its immaturity is lack of a valid\nand proper physics-based model for large deformation situations. In practical\nonline and large deformation applications, the inverse non-autoregressive\nidentification based models are the proper choices but if we want to know how\nIPMC works and what is the physics of its behavior in the large deformation\nsituation the inverse identification based models are deeply blind, and we have\nto use physical and multi-physical approaches. It is our main aim in this\npaper, and for the first time, we want to present a fully analytical and\nphysics-based ion transport 3D and non-Linear model for large deformable IPMC.\nIn this direction, based on three dimensional Nernst-Plank PDE we will find a\nwell-defined and valid relationship between input voltage and output tip\ndisplacement of IPMC for large deformation situation and with four provable\npieces of evidence it will be proven that proposed model has chosen a proper\nway and it is more complete than previous benchmark and well-known\nphysics-based models for IPMC, and also it is valid and accurate enough for\nlarge deformation modeling of IPMC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Oct 2019 10:42:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-13"}
