The principal\nnonlinear effects come through the beam's inextensibility---local arc length\npreservation---rather than traditional extensible effects attributed to fully\nrestricted boundary conditions. Enforcing inextensibility leads to: nonlinear\nstiffness terms, which appear as quasilinear and semilinear effects, as well as\nnonlinear inertia effects, appearing as nonlocal terms that make the beam\nimplicit in the acceleration.\n  In this paper we discuss the derivation of the equations of motion via\nHamilton's principle with a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the effective\ninextensibility constraint.

A distinguishing feature is that the two types\nof nonlinear terms prevent independent challenges: the quasilinear nature of\nthe stiffness forces higher topologies for solutions, while the nonlocal\ninertia requires the consideration of Kelvin-Voigt type damping to close\nestimates.

These mechanisms include assortative or\nnetworked social interactions, other-regarding preferences considering the\npayoffs of others, reciprocity rules to establish cooperation as a social norm,\nand multilevel selection involving simultaneous competition between individuals\nfavoring cheaters and competition between groups favoring cooperators. In this\npaper, we build on recent work studying PDE replicator equations for multilevel\nselection to understand how within-group mechanisms of assortment,\nother-regarding preferences, and both direct and indirect reciprocity can help\nto facilitate cooperation in concert with evolutionary competition between\ngroups. We consider a group-structured population in which interactions between\nindividuals consist of Prisoners' Dilemma games, and study the dynamics of\nmultilevel competition determined by the payoffs individuals receive when\ninteracting according to these within-group mechanisms. We find that the\npresence of each of these mechanisms acts synergistically with multilevel\nselection for the promotion of cooperation, decreasing the strength of\nbetween-group competition required to sustain long-time cooperation and\nincreasing the collective payoff achieved by the population. However, we find\nthat only other-regarding preferences allows for the achievement of socially\noptimal collective payoffs for Prisoners' Dilemma games in which average payoff\nis maximized by an intermediate mix of cooperators and defectors. For the other\nthree mechanisms, the multilevel dynamics remain susceptible to a shadow of\nlower-level selection, as the collective outcome fails to exceed the payoff of\nthe all-cooperator group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 17:12:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 08:04:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 17:01:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 06:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

As a result, traditional models trained over large datasets may\nfail to recognize highly predictive localized effects in favour of weakly\npredictive global patterns. This is a problem because localized effects are\ncritical to developing individualized policies and treatment plans in\napplications ranging from precision medicine to advertising. To address this\nchallenge, we propose to estimate sample-specific models that tailor inference\nand prediction at the individual level. In contrast to classical ML models that\nestimate a single, complex model (or only a few complex models), our approach\nproduces a model personalized to each sample. These sample-specific models can\nbe studied to understand subgroup dynamics that go beyond coarse-grained class\nlabels. Crucially, our approach does not assume that relationships between\nsamples (e.g. a similarity network) are known a priori. Instead, we use\nunmodeled covariates to learn a latent distance metric over the samples. We\napply this approach to financial, biomedical, and electoral data as well as\nsimulated data and show that sample-specific models provide fine-grained\ninterpretations of complicated phenomena without sacrificing predictive\naccuracy compared to state-of-the-art models such as deep neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 17:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

In this work we prove that two graphs are\nquantum isomorphic (in the commuting operator framework) if and only if they\nadmit the same number of homomorphisms from any planar graph. As there exist\npairs of non-isomorphic graphs that are quantum isomorphic, this implies that\nhomomorphism counts from planar graphs do not determine a graph up to\nisomorphism. Another immediate consequence is that determining whether there\nexists some planar graph that has a different number of homomorphisms to two\ngiven graphs is an undecidable problem, since quantum isomorphism is known to\nbe undecidable. Our characterization of quantum isomorphism is proven via a\ncombinatorial characterization of the intertwiner spaces of the quantum\nautomorphism group of a graph based on counting homomorphisms from planar\ngraphs. This result inspires the definition of \"graph categories\" which are\nanalogous to, and a generalization of, partition categories that are the basis\nof the definition of easy quantum groups. Thus we introduce a new class of\n\"graph-theoretic quantum groups\" whose intertwiner spaces are spanned by maps\nassociated to (bi-labeled) graphs.

The superradiant\ninstability associated with a rapidly spinning black hole leads to the creation\nof an axion cloud which carries energy and angular momentum from the black\nhole. This cloud will then decay via gravitational wave emission. We show that\nthe energy lost as a result of this process tends toward an outspiraling of the\nbinary orbit. A given binary system is sensitive to a narrow range of axion\nmasses, determined by the mass of the black hole. Pulsar-black hole binaries,\nonce detected in the electromagnetic band, will allow high-precision\nmeasurements of black hole mass loss via timing measurements of the companion\npulsar. This avenue of investigation is particularly promising in light of the\nrecent preliminary announcements of two candidate black hole-neutron star\nmergers by LIGO/VIRGO (#S190814bv and #S190426c).

Under\nideal conditions the function $D=2|\\nabla P|/\\nabla^2 P$ yields an approximate\ndistance to vortex centerlines. As opposed to local methods to identify\ncoherent structures, isosurfaces of $D$ produce a field of vortex tubes\nequidistant to the vortex core center which, ideally, are independent of vortex\nintensity or size. In contrast to other line-vortex identification methods,\nwhich typically rely on algorithms to detect vortex core lines and frequently\nneed complex implementations, the proposed method can be computed from the\nlocal Eulerian velocity and pressure fields as easily as vortex identification\nmethods such as the $Q$ and $\\lambda_2$ criteria. $2|\\nabla P|/\\nabla^2 P$\nresults in the exact distance to the core center for a Rankine vortex and is in\ngeneral valid for the region of a vortex where there is pure rotation, yielding\nan approximation to the distance farther from the core in other simple\none-dimensional vortex models.

In this paper,\nprobabilistic counting is used as an anonymization technique that provides a\nreliable estimate of the number of unique users. We extend previous work in\nprobabilistic counting by considering its use for preserving user anonymity,\ndeveloping application guidelines and including hash collisions in the\nestimate. Our work complements previous method by attempting to explore the\ncauses of the deviation of uncorrected estimate from the real value. The\nexperimental results show that if the proper register size is used, collision\ncompensation provides estimates are as good as, if not better than, the\noriginal probabilistic counting. We develop a new anonymity metric to precisely\nquantify the degree of anonymity the algorithm provides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 19:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-17"}

Here, we demonstrate that any simple droplet dripper, in\nwhich millimetric droplets are created by letting them drip under gravity from\na hollow needle, is readily turned into a versatile droplet generator capable\nof producing drops smaller than the needle diameter. This is achieved by\nvibrating the needle base at a frequency close to a flexing resonance of the\nneedle tube. Through high-speed imaging and detailed image analysis we show\nthat the droplets flung off one-by-one from the needle tip are uniform in size.\nThe produced drop size is mainly set by the driving frequency and is\npractically independent of needle geometry or driving amplitude, making the\ngenerator robust and easily tunable. Like for a simple dripper, the drop\nejection rate is independently controlled through the flow-rate. Since the\nneedle diameter can be much larger than the produced drop size, clogging is not\nan issue. By using needles with different resonant frequencies we could produce\ndroplets with radii anywhere between 100 microns to 1 mm with a high\nreproducibility (the production of smaller drops is possible in principle).

However, this technique relies on using an appropriate\nset of training data to be successful. By combining hydrodynamical simulations,\nsynthetic observations and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we\nquantitatively assess how realistic simulated galaxy images must be in order to\nreliably classify mergers. Specifically, we compare the performance of CNNs\ntrained with two types of galaxy images, stellar maps and dust-inclusive\nradiatively transferred images, each with three levels of observational\nrealism: (1) no observational effects (idealized images), (2) realistic sky and\npoint spread function (semi-realistic images), (3) insertion into a real sky\nimage (fully realistic images). We find that networks trained on either\nidealized or semi-real images have poor performance when applied to\nsurvey-realistic images. In contrast, networks trained on fully realistic\nimages achieve 87.1% classification performance. Importantly, the level of\nrealism in the training images is much more important than whether the images\nincluded radiative transfer, or simply used the stellar maps (87.1% compared to\n79.6% accuracy, respectively). Therefore, one can avoid the large computational\nand storage cost of running radiative transfer with a relatively modest\ncompromise in classification performance. Making photometry-based networks\ninsensitive to colour incurs a very mild penalty to performance with\nsurvey-realistic data (86.0% with r-only compared to 87.1% with gri). This\nresult demonstrates that while colour can be exploited by colour-sensitive\nnetworks, it is not necessary to achieve high accuracy and so can be avoided if\ndesired.

The global optimal\nperformance in terms of energy cost is met for a market structure (H-MGs,\nconsumers, and retailers) at a Nash optimum point for the formulated scheduling\ngame considering local and general constraints on the spot market.

While greedy delexicalization of slots in the input\nutterance via substring matching can partly improve performance, it often\nproduces incorrect input. Moreover, such techniques cannot delexicalize slots\nwith out-of-vocabulary slot values not seen at training. In this paper, we\npropose a novel iterative delexicalization algorithm, which can accurately\ndelexicalize the input, even with out-of-vocabulary slot values. Based on model\nconfidence of the current delexicalized input, our algorithm improves\ndelexicalization in every iteration to converge to the best input having the\nhighest confidence.

In particular we treat three\nquasi-local masses based on a Hamiltonian approach, namely the Brown-York,\nLiu-Yau, and Wang-Yau masses. The geometric inequalities are motivated by\nanalogous results for the ADM mass. They may be interpreted as localized\nversions of these inequalities, and are also closely tied to the conjectured\nBekenstein bounds for entropy of macroscopic bodies. In addition, we give a new\nproof of the positivity property for the Wang-Yau mass which is used to remove\nthe spin condition in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we generalize a recent\nresult of Lu and Miao to obtain a localized version of the Penrose inequality\nfor the static Wang-Yau mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 22:24:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

It is\nwell known that dense subgraphs can have strong correlation with structures of\ninterest in real-world networks across various domains ranging from social\nnetworks to biological systems [Gionis and Tsourakakis `15].\n  For the densest subgraph problem, Charikar's greedy algorithm [Asashiro `00,\nCharikar `00] is very simple, and can typically find result of quality much\nbetter than the provable factor 2-approximation, which makes it very popular in\npractice. However, it is also known to give suboptimal output in many\nreal-world examples. On the other hand, finding the exact optimal solution\nrequires the computation of maximum flow. Despite the existence of highly\noptimized maximum flow solvers, such computation still incurs prohibitive\ncomputational costs for the massive graphs arising in modern data science\napplications.\n  We devise an iterative algorithm which naturally generalizes the greedy\nalgorithm of Charikar. Our algorithm draws insights from the iterative\napproaches from convex optimization, and also exploits the dual interpretation\nof the densest subgraph problem. We have empirical evidence that our algorithm\nis much more robust against the structural heterogeneities in real-world\ndatasets, and converges to the optimal subgraph density even when the simple\ngreedy algorithm fails. On the other hand, in instances where Charikar's\nalgorithm performs well, our algorithm is able to quickly verify its\noptimality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is significantly faster\nthan the maximum flow based exact optimal algorithm. We conduct experiments on\ndatasets from broad domains, and our algorithm achieves $\\sim$145$\\times$\nspeedup on average to find subgraphs whose density is at least 90\\% of the\noptimal value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 22:27:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 03:37:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-18"}

Our approach utilizes\nthe high capacity of a neural network more efficiently and does not require\nstoring the previously learned data that might raise privacy concerns.\nExperiments on common benchmarks reveal the effectiveness of the proposed OGD\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 23:31:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-17"}

We found a large number of new doubly eclipsing\nsystems (our discoveries are 3x more numerous than previous studies). With a\ntypical orbital period of days for the binaries, we sought eclipse time\nvariations (ETVs) on the timescale of years. In the cases where we were able to\ndetect the ETV period, the difference between the inner and outer periods in\nthe quadruple system is large enough. This allows us to interpret ETVs\nprimarily as the light-time effect, thus providing an interesting constraint on\nmasses of the binaries. Results: In addition to significantly enlarging the\ndatabase of known doubly eclipsing systems, we performed a thorough analysis of\n72 cases. ETVs for 28 of them (39% of the studied cases) showed evidence of\nrelative motion. We note OGLE BLG-ECL-145467 as the most interesting case; it\nis bright (I=12.6 mag), consists of two detached binaries with periods of about\n3.3 d and 4.9 d (making it a candidate for a 3:2 resonant system), mutual\nperiod about 1538 d. Distribution of the orbital period ratio P_A/P_B of\nbinaries in 2+2 quadruples shows statistically significant excess at 1 and 1.5.\nThe former is likely a natural statistical preference in weakly interacting\nsystems with periods within the same range. The latter is thought to be\nevidence of a capture in the 3:2 mean motion resonance of the two binaries.\nThis sets important constraints on evolutionary channels in these systems. The\ntotal number of doubly eclipsing systems increased to 146, more than 90% of\nwhich are at low declinations on the southern sky.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 00:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-17"}

Since failure here invalidates quantification, high accuracy\nis required. For this purpose, this study presents a robust AIF detection\nmethod using the convolutional neural net (CNN) model. CNN models were trained\nby assembling 25,027 scans (N=12,984 patients) from three hospitals, seven\nscanners. A test set of 5,721 scans (N=2,805 patients) evaluated model\nperformance. The 2D+T AIF time series was inputted into CNN. Two variations\nwere investigated: a) Two Classes (2CS) for background and foreground (LV\nmask); b) Three Classes (3CS) for background, foreground LV and RV. Final model\nwas deployed on MR scanners via the Gadgetron InlineAI. Model loading time on\nMR scanner was ~340ms and applying it took ~180ms. The 3CS model successfully\ndetect LV for 99.98% of all test cases (1 failed out of 5,721 cases). The mean\nDice ratio for 3CS was 0.87+/-0.08 with 92.0% of all test cases having Dice\nratio >0.75, while the 2CS model gave lower Dice of 0.82+/-0.22 (P<1e-5).\nExtracted AIF signals using CNN were further compared to manual ground-truth\nfor foot-time, peak-time, first-pass duration, peak value and area-under-curve.\nNo significant differences were found for all features (P>0.2). This study\nproposed, validated, and deployed a robust CNN solution to detect the LV for\nthe extraction of the AIF signal used in fully automated perfusion flow\nmapping. A very large data cohort was assembled and resulting models were\ndeployed to MR scanners for fully inline AI in clinical hospitals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 01:22:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 21:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-11"}

Gluon\nradiation by a heavy quark originated from a hard process, ceases shortly on a\ndistance of the order of few fm. Due to the dead-cone effect a heavy quark\nradiates only a small fraction of its energy. This is why the measured\nfragmentation function D(z) peaks at large z. Hadronization finishes at very\nshort distances, well shorter than 1 fm, by production of a colorless\nsmall-size Qq-bar dipole. This ensures dominance of a perturbative mechanism\nand makes possible factorization of short and long distances. The latter\ncorresponds to final state interactions of the produced dipole propagating\nthrough a dense medium. The results provide good description of data on beauty\nand charm suppression in heavy ion collisions, fixing the transport coefficient\nfor b-quarks about twice smaller than for charm, and both significantly lower\nthat the values determined from data on suppression of high-pT light hadrons.\nWe relate this to reduction of the QCD coupling at higher scales, and\nsuppression of radiation by the dead-cone effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 02:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-17"}

Processing large text data sets can be computationally expensive,\nhowever, especially if it involves sophisticated algorithms. This challenge is\nexacerbated when it is desirable to run different types of queries against a\ndata set, making it expensive to build multiple indices to speed up query\nprocessing. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a framework called EmApprox\nthat uses approximation to speed up the processing of a wide range of queries\nover large text data sets. The key insight is that different types of queries\ncan be approximated by processing subsets of data that are most similar to the\nqueries. EmApprox builds a general index for a data set by learning a natural\nlanguage processing model, producing a set of highly compressed vectors\nrepresenting words and subcollections of documents. Then, at query processing\ntime, EmApprox uses the index to guide sampling of the data set, with the\nprobability of selecting each subcollection of documents being proportional to\nits {\\em similarity} to the query as computed using the vector representations.\nWe have implemented a prototype of EmApprox as an extension of the Apache Spark\nsystem, and used it to approximate three types of queries: aggregation,\ninformation retrieval, and recommendation. Experimental results show that\nEmApprox's similarity-guided sampling achieves much better accuracy than random\nsampling. Further, EmApprox can achieve significant speedups if users can\ntolerate small amounts of inaccuracies. For example, when sampling at 10\\%,\nEmApprox speeds up a set of queries counting phrase occurrences by almost 10x\nwhile achieving estimated relative errors of less than 22\\% for 90\\% of the\nqueries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 03:13:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Jan 2020 19:54:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-14"}

This\npaper proposes a method that can create a high-resolution, long-term animation\nusing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from a single landscape image where\nwe mainly focus on skies and waters. Our key observation is that the motion\n(e.g., moving clouds) and appearance (e.g., time-varying colors in the sky) in\nnatural scenes have different time scales. We thus learn them separately and\npredict them with decoupled control while handling future uncertainty in both\npredictions by introducing latent codes. Unlike previous methods that infer\noutput frames directly, our CNNs predict spatially-smooth intermediate data,\ni.e., for motion, flow fields for warping, and for appearance, color transfer\nmaps, via self-supervised learning, i.e., without explicitly-provided ground\ntruth. These intermediate data are applied not to each previous output frame,\nbut to the input image only once for each output frame. This design is crucial\nto alleviate error accumulation in long-term predictions, which is the\nessential problem in previous recurrent approaches. The output frames can be\nlooped like cinemagraph, and also be controlled directly by specifying latent\ncodes or indirectly via visual annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour method through comparisons with the state-of-the-arts on video prediction\nas well as appearance manipulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 07:20:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-17"}

The SIEN consists of an intelligent management\nplane (ImP), an intelligence-enabled plane (IeP), a control plane and a user\nplane. For the ImP, the containers with decision execution are constructed by a\nnovel graph algorithm to organize objects such as network elements and resource\npartitions. For the IeP, a novel learning system is designed with decision\nmaking using a congruity function for generalization and personalization in the\npresence of imbalanced, conflicting and partial data. For the control plane, a\nscheme of identifier-locator mapping is designed by referring to\ninformation-centric networking and software-defined networking. For the user\nplane, the registrations, requests and data are forwarded to implement the SIEN\nand test its performance. The evaluation shows the SIEN outperforms four\nstate-of-the-art techniques for redundant traffic reduction by up to 46.04%\nbased on a mix of assumption, simulation and proof-of-concept implementation\nfor audio-visual-tactile Internet multimedia service. To confirm the validity,\nthe best case and the worst case for traffic offloading are tested with the\ndata rate, the latency and the density.

Given solutions up to $t_n=n \\Delta t$\nwith $\\Delta t$ the time step size, we linearize the EQ-reformulated gradient\nflow model in $(t_n, t_{n+1}]$ by extrapolation.

This study proposes a novel sensormovement-robust\n3-DoF method for lower-limb joint angle estimation without calibration. A\nrealtime optimization process, which is based on a feedback iteration progress\nto identify three joint axes of a 3-DoF joint, has been presented with a\nreference frame calibration algorithm, and a safe-guarded strategy is proposed\nto detect and compensate for the errors caused by sensor movements. The\nexperimental results obtained from a 3-DoF gimbal and ten healthy subjects\ndemonstrate a promising performance on 3-DoF angle estimation. Specially, the\nexperiments on ten subjects are performed with three gait modes and a 2-min\nlevel walking. The root mean square error is below 2 deg for level walking and\n5 deg for other two gait modes. The result of 2-min level walking shows our\nalgorithms stability under long run. The robustness against sensor movement are\ndemonstrated through data from multiple sets of IMUs. In addition, results from\nthe 3-DoF gimbal indicate that the accuracy of 3-DoF angle estimation could be\nimproved by 84.9% with our reference frame calibration algorithm. In\nconclusion, our study proposes and validates a sensor-movement-robust 3-DoF\nangle estimation for lowerlimb joints based on IMU.

We also gives an asymptotic\nbound for q-ary r locality LRC codes better than the previously konwn bound.\nMany long r-locality LRC codes with small defects are also constructed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 10:38:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Oct 2019 00:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

A central\naspect for such approaches is the mapping from the design parameters which\nencode the geometry of the shape to be improved to the quality criteria which\ndescribe its performance. The choices to be made in the setup of the\noptimization process strongly influence this mapping and thus are expected to\nhave a profound influence on the achievable result. In this work we explore the\ninfluence of such choices on the effects on the shape optimization of a\nturbofan rotor blade as it can be realized within an aircraft engine design\nprocess. The blade quality is assessed by realistic three dimensional\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.\n  We investigate the outcomes of several optimization runs which differ in\nvarious configuration options, such as optimization algorithm, initialization,\nnumber of degrees of freedom for the parametrization. For all such variations,\nwe generally find that the achievable improvement of the blade quality is\ncomparable for most settings and thus rather insensitive to the details of the\nsetup.\n  On the other hand, even supposedly minor changes in the settings, such as\nusing a different random seed for the initialization of the optimizer\nalgorithm, lead to very different shapes. Optimized shapes which show\ncomparable performance usually differ quite strongly in their geometries over\nthe complete blade.\n  Our analyses indicate that the fitness landscape for such a realistic\nturbofan rotor blade optimization is highly multi-modal with many local optima,\nwhere very different shapes show similar performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 10:38:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-17"}

Since in the fast solar wind fluctuations preserve the\nmodulus of the magnetic field to a good approximation, the tip of the magnetic\nfield vector is observed to move on a sphere of approximately constant radius\n|B|. We then compare statistics of solar wind measurements with that of a\nsimple model of a random walk bounded on a spherical surface. The analogy\nconsists in the fact that in both systems the geometrical constraint imposes a\nlimiting amplitude at large separations and thus introduces a break scale in\nthe power spectrum of the fluctuations, leading to a shallower slope for scales\nwhere the fluctuations amplitude becomes scale-independent. However, while in\nthe case of the random walk the saturation of the fluctuations occurs when the\npattern becomes uniform on the sphere (flat distribution of the cosine of the\nrotation angle), transitioning then to a white noise regime, in the solar wind\nmagnetic field fluctuations saturate in amplitude maintaining a preferential\ndirection. We suggest that this behaviour is due to the presence of the\nbackground interplanetary magnetic field, which keeps some long-range memory in\nthe system also when the fluctuations becomes independent of the scale.

Toward\nIRS2, the polarization is confined mainly to the outflow cavity walls. Along\nthe northern edge of the redshifted outflow cavity of IRS2, the polarized\nemission is sandwiched between the outflow and a filament of cold, dense gas\ntraced by N$_2$D$^+$, toward which no dust polarization is detected. This\nsuggests that the origin of the enhanced polarization in IRS2 is the\nirradiation of the outflow cavity walls, which enables the alignment of dust\ngrains with respect to the magnetic field -- but only to a depth of ~300 au,\nbeyond which the dust is cold and unpolarized. However, in order to align\ngrains deep enough in the cavity walls, and to produce the high polarization\nfraction seen in IRS2, the aligning photons are likely to be in the mid- to\nfar-infrared range, which suggests a degree of grain growth beyond what is\ntypically expected in very young, Class 0 sources.

However, state-action space exploration is more difficult in this\ncase. Recent RL approaches to learning with sparse rewards have leveraged\nhigh-quality human demonstrations for the task, but these can be costly, time\nconsuming or even impossible to obtain.

In order to exploit this idea, we\nintroduce a framework whereby an object locomotion policy is initially obtained\nusing a realistic physics simulator. This policy is then used to generate\nauxiliary rewards, called simulated locomotion demonstration rewards (SLDRs),\nwhich enable us to learn the robot manipulation policy.

Different from the classical slotted Aloha, each node in the slotted\nAloha with batch service can transmit up to M packets once it succeeds in\nchannel competition. The throughput is substantially improved because up to M\npackets jointly undertake the overhead due to contention. In an innovative\nvacation model developed in this paper, we consider each batch of data\ntransmission as a busy period of each node, and the process between two\nsuccessive busy periods as a vacation period. We then formulate the number of\narrivals during a vacation period in a renewal-type equation, which\ncharacterizes the dependency between busy periods and vacation periods. Based\non this formulation, we derive the mean waiting time of a packet and the\nbounded delay region for the slotted Aloha with batch service. Our results\nindicate the throughput and delay performances are substantially improved with\nthe increase of batch sizeM, and the bounded delay region is enlarged\naccordingly. As M goes to infinity, we find the saturated throughput can\napproach 100% of channel capacity, and the system remains stable irrespective\nof the population size and transmission probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 12:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-17"}

Dust traps at radial pressure maxima bounding disk gaps can cut\noff the inner disk from such volatile reservoirs. However, the trap retention\nefficiency and atomic composition of trapped dust have not been measured.\n  We present a new technique to measure the absolute atomic abundances in gas\naccreting onto T Tauri stars and infer the bulk atomic composition and\ndistribution of midplane solids retained in the disk around the young star TW\nHya. We identify line emission from gas-phase material inside the dust\nsublimation rim of TW Hya. Gaussian decomposition of the strongest H Paschen\nlines isolates the inner disk hydrogen emission. We measure several key\nelemental abundances, relative to hydrogen, using a chemical photoionization\nmodel and infer dust retention in the disk. With a 1D transport model, we\ndetermine approximate radial locations and retention efficiencies of dust traps\nfor different elements. Volatile and refractory elements are depleted from TW\nHya's hot gas by factors of ~10^2 and up to 10^5, respectively. Dust traps\nbeyond the CO and N2 snowline cumulatively sequester 96% of the total dust,\nwhile the trap at 2 AU retains 3% of the initial dust mass. The high depletions\nof Si, Mg, and Ca are explained by a third trap at 0.3 AU. TW Hya has a\nsignificant volatile reservoir rich in C- and N-ices in its outer ring\nstructure. However, the lack of C resupply may leave the terrestrial\nplanet-forming region dry and carbon-poor. Any planets that form within the\nsilicate dust trap at 0.3 AU may resemble Earth in terms of the degree of their\nvolatile depletion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 13:47:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 09:55:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

The proposed method\niteratively unveils abnormalities based on the prediction of a classifier\ntrained only with image-level labels. For each image, initial visual evidence\nof the prediction is extracted with a given visual attribution technique. This\nprovides localization of abnormalities that are then removed through selective\ninpainting. We iteratively apply this procedure until the system considers the\nimage as normal. This yields augmented visual evidence, including less\ndiscriminative lesions which were not detected at first but should be\nconsidered for final diagnosis.

Given\nthe infancy of the field, there has been very limited exploration into the\nassessment of the performance of explainability methods, with most evaluations\ncentered around subjective visual interpretation of the produced\ninterpretations. In this study, we explore a more machine-centric strategy for\nquantifying the performance of explainability methods on deep neural networks\nvia the notion of decision-making impact analysis. We introduce two\nquantitative performance metrics: i) Impact Score, which assesses the\npercentage of critical factors with either strong confidence reduction impact\nor decision changing impact, and ii) Impact Coverage, which assesses the\npercentage coverage of adversarially impacted factors in the input. A\ncomprehensive analysis using this approach was conducted on several\nstate-of-the-art explainability methods (LIME, SHAP, Expected Gradients,\nGSInquire) on a ResNet-50 deep convolutional neural network using a subset of\nImageNet for the task of image classification.

The exception are the parameters controlling the speed of\nmolecular transitions (e.g. ATP driven phosphorylation rate), for which memory\nlifetime per invested energy can increase progressively for longer memories.\nFurthermore, in general, a memory trace decouples dynamically from a\ncorresponding synaptic metabolic rate such that the energy expended on a new\nlearning and its memory trace constitutes in most cases only a small fraction\nof the baseline energy associated with prior memories.

For energy autonomy, these\napplications are typically powered by energy harvesters. As harvesters and\nother power sources which provide energy autonomy inevitably have power\nvariations, the circuits need to robustly operate over a dynamic power\nenvelope.

We show\nthat these models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and introduce a novel\napproach for attacking trained models of code using adversarial examples. The\nmain idea of our approach is to force a given trained model to make an\nincorrect prediction, as specified by the adversary, by introducing small\nperturbations that do not change the program's semantics, thereby creating an\nadversarial example. To find such perturbations, we present a new technique for\nDiscrete Adversarial Manipulation of Programs (DAMP). DAMP works by deriving\nthe desired prediction with respect to the model's inputs, while holding the\nmodel weights constant, and following the gradients to slightly modify the\ninput code. We show that our DAMP attack is effective across three neural\narchitectures: code2vec, GGNN, and GNN-FiLM, in both Java and C#. Our\nevaluations demonstrate that DAMP has up to 89% success rate in changing a\nprediction to the adversary's choice (a targeted attack) and a success rate of\nup to 94% in changing a given prediction to any incorrect prediction (a\nnon-targeted attack). To defend a model against such attacks, we empirically\nexamine a variety of possible defenses and discuss their trade-offs. We show\nthat some of these defenses can dramatically drop the success rate of the\nattacker, with a minor penalty of 2% relative degradation in accuracy when they\nare not performing under attack.

Research has shown that the adoption of human-centric building\nservices and amenities leads to improvements in the operational efficiency of\nthese cyber-physical systems directed towards controlling building energy\nusage.

The\npaper first reviews the intimate relation between the causality of a physically\nrealizable constitutive model and the analyticity of its frequency-response\nfunction and explains that in theory it is sufficient to conduct a nonlinear\nregression analysis for estimating the model parameters either on only the real\npart or on only the imaginary part of its frequency-response function, given\nthat they are related with the Hilbert transform. Consequently, the resulting\nmodel-parameters are real-valued; therefore, there is no theoretical\njustification to conduct the nonlinear regression analysis for estimating the\nmodel parameters in the complex space. The paper concludes with an example by\nshowing that the relaxation modulus of the complex-coefficient Maxwell model is\na divergent function at all positive times; therefore it is not a physically\nrealizable constitutive model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 14:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

Computational results are generated\nacross multiple symmetric and asymmetric instances. The results demonstrate the\nGreedy Tracker is the fastest method for preventing subtours for instances\nbelow 400 nodes. A distinction between fragment constructive heuristics and the\nsubtour elimination methodology used to ensure the feasibility of resulting\nsolutions enables the introduction of a new node-greedy fragment heuristic\ncalled Ordered Greedy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 19:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

This promises numerous advantages for economic values and\nautonomous control of energy sources. In smart grids development, there are\nvarious objectives such as voltage stability, minimized power loss, minimized\neconomic cost and voltage profile improvement. Thus, researchers have\ninvestigated several approaches based on meta-heuristic optimization algorithms\nfor the optimal location and sizing of electrical units in a distribution\nsystem. Meta-heuristic algorithms have been applied to solve different problems\nin power systems and they have been successfully used in distribution systems.\nThis paper presents a comprehensive review on existing methods for the optimal\nlocation and sizing of electrical units in distribution networks while\nconsidering the improvement of major objective functions. Techniques such as\nvoltage stability index, power loss index, and loss sensitivity factors have\nbeen implemented alongside the meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to reduce\nthe search space of solutions for objective functions. However, these\ntechniques can cause a loss of optimality. Another perceived problem is the\ninappropriate handling of multiple objectives, which can also affect the\noptimality of results. Hence, a recent method such as Pareto fronts generation\nhas been developed to produce non-dominating solutions. This review shows a\nneed for more research on (i) the effective handling of multiple objective\nfunctions, (ii) more efficient meta-heuristic optimization algorithms and/or\n(iii) better supporting techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 07:45:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

The second memory architecture\nincorporates a single NTM module, which stores parallel context information for\nboth speakers.
