Our model follows previous\nwork in assuming that generator outputs respond to load imbalances according to\nan affine control policy, but introduces a model of saturation of generator\nreserves by assuming that when a generator's target level hits its limit, it\nabandons the affine policy and produces at that limit. This is a particularly\ninteresting feature in models where wind power plants, which have uncertain\nupper generation limits, are scheduled to provide reserves to balance load\nfluctuations. The resulting model is a nonsmooth nonconvex two-stage stochastic\nprogram, and we use a stochastic approximation method to find stationary\nsolutions to a smooth approximation. Computational results on 6-bus and 118-bus\ntest instances demonstrates that by considering the effects of saturation, our\nmodel can yield solutions with lower expected generation costs (at the same\ntarget line violation probability level) than those obtained from a model that\nenforces the affine policy to stay within generator limits with high\nprobability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 16:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-11"}

In our\nexperiments, single barchans evolve, under the action of a water turbulent\nflow, from heaps of conical shape formed from glass beads poured on the bottom\nwall of a rectangular channel. Both for evolving and developed barchans, the\nhorns are fed up with grains coming from upstream regions of the bedform and\ntraveling with significant transverse components, differently from the dynamics\nusually described for the aeolian case. For these grains, irrespective of their\nsize and strength of water flow, the distributions of transverse and streamwise\ncomponents of velocities are well described by exponential functions, with the\nprobability density functions of their magnitudes being similar to results\nobtained from previous studies on flat beds. Focusing on moving grains whose\ninitial positions were on the horns, we show that their residence time and\ntraveled distance are related following a quasi-linear relation. Our results\nprovide new insights into the physical mechanisms underlying the shape of\nbarchan dunes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 16:19:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-11"}

Milky Way CCs are the only stars of this class accessible to\ntrigonometric parallax measurements. Until recently, the most accurate\ntrigonometric parallaxes of Milky Way CCs were the HST/FGS measurements\ncollected by Benedict et al. (2002, 2007) and HST/WFC3 measurements by Riess et\nal. (2018). Unfortunately, the second Gaia data release (GDR2) has not yet\ndelivered reliable parallaxes for Galactic CCs, failing to replace the HST as\nthe foundation of the Galactic calibrations of the Leavitt law. We aim at\ncalibrating independently the Leavitt law of Milky Way CCs based on the GDR2\ncatalog of trigonometric parallaxes. As a proxy for the parallaxes of a sample\nof 23 Galactic CCs, we adopt the GDR2 parallaxes of their spatially resolved\ncompanions. As the latter are unsaturated, photometrically stable stars, this\nnovel approach allows us to bypass the GDR2 bias on the parallax of the CCs\nthat is induced by saturation and variability. We present new Galactic\ncalibrations of the Leavitt law in the J, H, K, V, Wesenheit WH and Wesenheit\nWVK bands based on the GDR2 parallaxes of the CC companions.

The peculiarity of Friedel oscillations in three dimensions is that\nthe contributions from small and large scales are typically comparable, making\nthe DOS correction sensitive to the details of the interaction and\ndemonstrating a significant particle-hole asymmetry. On the other hand, we show\nthat the non-analytic part of the DOS is determined by large scales and can be\nexpressed in terms of the Fermi-surface characteristics only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 17:13:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 15:50:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

We find that our fiducial disc, initially in a fragmentation regime,\nmoves toward a pure-growth regime in a few thousands years. Timescales change\nas a function of the disc and dust properties. When fragmentation is efficient,\nit produces, in different zones of the disc, Fe/Si and rock/ice ratios\ndifferent from those predicted when only pure growth is considered. Chemical\nfractionation and the depletion/enrichment in iron observed in some chondrites\ncan be linked to the size-density sorting and fragmentation properties of\nprecursor dusty grains . We suggest that aggregation of chondritic components\ncould have occurred where/when fragmentation was not efficient if their\naerodynamical sorting has to be preserved. Chondritic components would allow\naerodynamical sorting in a fragmentation regime only if they have similar\nfragmentation properties. We find that, in the inner disc, and for the same\ninterval of time, fragmenting dust can grow larger when compared to the size of\ngrains predicted by pure growth. This counter-intuitive behaviour is due to the\nlarge amount of dust which piles up in a fragmenting zone followed by the rapid\ngrowth that occurs when this zone transitions to a pure growth regime. As an\nimportant consequence, dust can overcome the radial-drift barrier within a few\nthousands years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 17:20:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

The emergent\nbehavior of the F2BP is highly coupled translational and rotational mutual\nmotion of the mass distributions. A large fraction of characterized binary\nasteroids appear to be at, or near, the doubly synchronous equilibrium, which\noccurs when both bodies are tidally-locked and in a circular co-orbit. Stable\noscillations about this equilibrium can be shown, for the nonplanar system, to\nbe combinations of seven fundamental frequencies of the system and the mutual\norbit rate. The fundamental frequencies arise as the linear periods of center\nmanifolds identified about the equilibrium which are heavily influenced by each\nbody's mass parameters. We leverage these eight dynamical constraints to\ninvestigate the observability of binary asteroid mass parameters via dynamical\nobservations. This is accomplished by deriving a relationship between the\nfundamental frequencies and mass parameters for doubly synchronous systems.\nThis relationship allows us to show the sensitivity of the dynamics to changes\nin the mass parameters, first for the planar dynamics, and then for the\nnonplanar dynamics. In so doing we are able to predict the idealized estimation\ncovariance of the mass parameters based on observation quality and define\nidealized observation accuracies for desired mass parameter certainties.

It is less obvious if 3D Type-II\nfractons can be understood from a similar perspective. In this paper, we affirm\nthat this is the case: we produce the paradigm Type-II fracton model, Haah's\ncubic code, from a 2D layer construction. However, this is not a condensation\nof 2D anyons, but rather we start with stacks of 2D subsystem-symmetry\nprotected topological states (SSPT). As this parent model is not topologically\nordered in the strict sense, whereas the final state is, we refer to this\nprocess as a distillation as we are forming a long-range entangled (LRE) state\nfrom several copies of a short-range entangled (SRE) state. We also show that\nType-I fracton topological order can also be distilled from SSPT states in the\nform of the cluster-cube model which we introduce here. We start by introducing\nthe Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory of distillation. However, a more\ndetailed analysis from which the perturbation theory follows, is also performed\nusing linear gauge structures and an extension we introduce here referred to as\ngauge substructures. This allows us to rigorously define distillation as well\nas understand the process of obtaining LRE from SRE. We can diagnose the source\nof LRE as the distillation of subsystem symmetries into robust long-range\nground state degeneracy as characterized by logical operators of the resulting\nstabilizer code. Furthermore, we find which Hamiltonian terms are necessary for\nselecting the ground state which results from the perturbation. This leads to a\nprotocol for realizing a fracton quantum error correcting code initialized in a\nchosen fiducial state using only finite-depth circuits and local measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-14"}

In many\ncases such excitations exhibit horizons or instabilities, suggesting that there\nare bounds on the size and structure of field excitations that can be achieved\nin EFT. Static bubbles in ordinary Kaluza-Klein theory provide a simple class\nof examples: the KK radius goes to zero on a smooth surface, locally probing an\ninfinite distance point, and the bubbles are classically unstable against\nradial perturbations. However, it is also possible to stabilize KK bubbles at\nthe classical level by adding flux.

This remains a complex\nproblem, as many HIV infected individuals remain unaware of their infection\nstatus, leading to parts of HIV epidemics being undiagnosed and under-reported.\nTo that end, we firstly present a method to learn epidemiological parameters\nfrom phylogenetic trees, using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). The\nepidemiological parameters learned as a result of applying ABC are subsequently\nused in epidemiological models that aim to simulate a specific epidemic.\nSecondly, we continue by describing the development of a tree statistic, rooted\nin coalescent theory, which we use to relate epidemiological parameters to a\nphylogenetic tree, by using the simulated epidemics. We show that the presented\ntree statistic enables differentiation of epidemiological parameters, while\nonly relying on phylogenetic trees, thus enabling the construction of new\nmethods to ascertain the epidemiological state of an HIV epidemic. By using\ngenetic data to infer epidemic sizes, we expect to enhance understanding of the\nportions of the infected population in which diagnosis rates are low.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 19:20:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 12:46:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 16:52:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-24"}

A source of uncertainty that has not previously\nbeen quantified in historical SST estimates stems from position errors. A\nBayesian inference framework is proposed for quantifying errors in reported\npositions and their implications on SST estimates. The analysis framework is\napplied to data from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set\n(ICOADS3.0) in 1885, a time when astronomical and chronometer estimation of\nposition was common, but predating the use of radio signals. Focus is upon a\nsubset of 943 ship tracks from ICOADS3.0 that report their position every two\nhours to a precision of 0.01{\\deg} longitude and latitude. These data are\ninterpreted as positions determined by dead reckoning that are periodically\nupdated by celestial correction techniques. The posterior medians of\nuncertainties in celestial correction are 33.1 km (0.30{\\deg} on the equator)\nin longitude and 24.4 km (0.22{\\deg}) in latitude, respectively.

Moreover, we find that the\nmerger rate per galaxy depends also on host galaxy's star formation rate and\nmetallicity. We derive a robust fitting formula that relates the merger rate\nper galaxy with galaxy's star formation rate, stellar mass and metallicity at\ndifferent redshifts. The typical masses of the host galaxies increase\nsignificantly as redshift decreases, as a consequence of the interplay between\ndelay time distribution of compact binaries and cosmic assembly of galaxies.\nFinally, we study the evolution of the merger rate density with redshift. At\nlow redshift ($z\\leq{}0.1$) early-type galaxies give a larger contribution to\nthe merger rate density than late-type galaxies. This trend reverts at\n$z\\ge{}1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 22:02:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Inspired by CMOS\nmulti-flip-flop asynchronous FIFO synchronizers, we then propose a novel 1-bit\nmetastability-resilient SFQ CDC FIFO that simulations show delivers over a 1000\nreduction in logical error rate at 30 GHz. Moreover, for a 10-stage FIFO, the\nJosephson junction (JJ) area of our proposed design is only 7.5% larger than\nthe non-resilient counterpart. Finally, we propose design guidelines that\ndefine the minimal FIFO depth subject to both throughput and burstiness\nconstraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 23:17:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 21:47:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}

Generally classical phonon size effects are\nemployed to reduce the thermal conductivity, where strong phonon scattering by\nnanostructured interfaces or boundaries can dramatically supress the heat\nconduction. When these boundaries or interfaces are arranged in a periodic\npattern, coherent phonons may have interference and modify the phonon\ndispersion, leading to dramatically reduced thermal conductivity. Such coherent\nphonon transport has been widely studied for superlattice films and recently\nemphasized for periodic nanoporous patterns. Although the wave effects have\nbeen proposed for reducing the thermal conductivity, more recent experimental\nevidence shows that such effects can only be critical at an ultralow\ntemperature, i.e., around 10 K or below. At room temperature, the impacted\nphonons are mostly restricted to hypersonic modes that contribute little to the\nthermal conductivity.

However, diabetes\ndiagnosis is still an arduous process, given that the disease develops and gets\ntreated outside the clinic. The emergence of wearable medical sensors (WMSs)\nand machine learning points to a way forward to address this challenge. WMSs\nenable a continuous mechanism to collect and analyze physiological signals.\nHowever, disease diagnosis based on WMS data and its effective deployment on\nresource-constrained edge devices remain challenging due to inefficient feature\nextraction and vast computation cost. In this work, we propose a framework\ncalled DiabDeep that combines efficient neural networks (called DiabNNs) with\nWMSs for pervasive diabetes diagnosis. DiabDeep bypasses the feature extraction\nstage and acts directly on WMS data. It enables both an (i) accurate inference\non the server, e.g., a desktop, and (ii) efficient inference on an edge device,\ne.g., a smartphone, based on varying design goals and resource budgets. On the\nserver, we stack sparsely connected layers to deliver high accuracy. On the\nedge, we use a hidden-layer long short-term memory based recurrent layer to cut\ndown on computation and storage. At the core of DiabDeep lies a grow-and-prune\ntraining flow: it leverages gradient-based growth and magnitude-based pruning\nalgorithms to learn both weights and connections for DiabNNs. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of DiabDeep through analyzing data from 52 participants. For\nserver (edge) side inference, we achieve a 96.3% (95.3%) accuracy in\nclassifying diabetics against healthy individuals, and a 95.7% (94.6%) accuracy\nin distinguishing among type-1/type-2 diabetic, and healthy individuals.\nAgainst conventional baselines, DiabNNs achieve higher accuracy, while reducing\nthe model size (FLOPs) by up to 454.5x (8.9x). Therefore, the system can be\nviewed as pervasive and efficient, yet very accurate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 01:04:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-14"}

With CDM-based random access, a set of sequences is\nreserved for random access. A remote station transmits a random access packet\nusing a randomly selected sequence among the set. If more than one remote\nstations transmit random access packets using the same sequence simultaneously,\nperformance degrades due to sequence collision. In addition, if more than one\nremote stations transmit random access packets using different sequences\nsimultaneously, performance also degrades due to interference. Therefore, the\nperformance of CDM-based random access is dependent on both sequence collision\nand interference.

To recognize these features from point clouds, this\npaper introduces an extreme point distance (EPD) criterion with scale\nindependence. Compared with traditional methods, the EPD greatly reduces the\nnumber of potential feature points and improves the robustness of multiscale\nfeature point recognition. On this basis, a feature enhancement algorithm based\non user priori guidance is proposed that adjusts the coordinates of the feature\narea by solving an objective equation containing the expected position and\nnormal constraints. Since the expected normal can be expressed as a function of\nneighborhood point coordinates, the above objective equation can be converted\ninto linear sparse equations with enhanced feature positions as variables, and\nthus, the closed solution can be obtained. In addition, a parameterization\nmethod for scattered point clouds based on feature line guidance is proposed,\nwhich reduces the number of unknowns by 2/3 and eliminates lateral sliding in\nthe direction perpendicular to feature lines.

The\nfirst objective is to learn semantic and instance-boundary detectors without\nmanual labeling. An adversarial training framework in conjunction with\nphysics-based simulation is used to achieve detectors that behave similarly in\nsynthetic and real data. Given the stochastic output of such detectors,\ncandidates for object poses are sampled. The second objective is to\nautomatically learn a single score for each pose candidate that represents its\nquality in terms of explaining the entire scene via a gradient boosted tree.\nThe proposed method uses features derived from surface and boundary alignment\nbetween the observed scene and the object model placed at hypothesized poses.\nScene-level, multi-instance pose estimation is then achieved by an integer\nlinear programming process that selects hypotheses that maximize the sum of the\nlearned individual scores, while respecting constraints, such as avoiding\ncollisions. To evaluate this method, a dataset of densely packed objects with\nchallenging setups for state-of-the-art approaches is collected.

Since low inertia is identified as one of the causes for deep\nfrequency Nadir, virtual inertia, which is provided by energy storage units, is\nsaid to be one of the solutions to the problem. In the present paper, we\npropose a new method for frequency control with energy storage systems (ESS),\ncalled dynamic droop control (iDroop), that can completely eliminate frequency\nNadir during transients. Nadir elimination allows us to perform frequency\nstability assessment without the need for direct numerical simulations of\nsystem dynamics. We make a direct comparison of our developed strategy with the\nusual control approaches --virtual inertia (VI) and droop control (DC)-- and\nshow that iDroop is more effective than both in eliminating the Nadir. More\nprecisely, iDroop achieves the Nadir elimination under significantly lower\ngains than virtual inertia and requires almost $40\\%$ less storage power\ncapacity to implement the control. Moreover, we show that rather unrealistic\ncontrol gains are required for virtual inertia in order to achieve Nadir\nelimination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 03:21:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 14:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

If\nthe HJB NN is sufficiently trained and the UAV is far away, the BS uploads the\nHJB NN model, enabling to locally carry out control decisions even when the\nconnection is lost. Simulations corroborate the effectiveness of oHJB in\nreducing the UAV's travel time and energy by utilizing the trade-off between\nuploading delays and control robustness in poor channel conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 04:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-14"}

In this paper, we\npropose a novel model, AGIS-Net, to transfer both shape and texture styles in\none-stage with only a few stylized samples. To achieve this goal, we first\ndisentangle the representations for content and style by using two encoders,\nensuring the multi-content and multi-style generation. Then we utilize two\ncollaboratively working decoders to generate the glyph shape image and its\ntexture image simultaneously. In addition, we introduce a local texture\nrefinement loss to further improve the quality of the synthesized textures. In\nthis manner, our one-stage model is much more efficient and effective than\nother multi-stage stacked methods.

One such typical material is black phosphorus (BP), with a\nlayer-dependent and highly tunable band gap. Such intrinsic anisotropy adds a\nnew degree of freedom to the excitation, detection and control of light.\nParticularly, hyperbolic plasmons with hyperbolic q-space dispersion are\npredicted to exist in BP films, where highly directional propagating polaritons\nwith divergent densities of states are hosted. Combined with a tunable\nelectronic structure, such natural hyperbolic surfaces may enable a series of\nexotic applications in nanophotonics. In this review, the anisotropic optical\nproperties and plasmons (especially hyperbolic plasmons) of BP are discussed.\nIn addition, other possible 2D material candidates (especially anisotropic\nlayered semimetals) for hyperbolic plasmons are examined.

By tuning the synthetic parameters, we disclose the key\nrole of the cation redox chemistry in the transition between two competitive\nphases: from 2D-nanoplatelets of brucite to layered double hydroxides (LDH).\nFor controlling the precipitation of different Ni, Fe, Co-hydroxide phases, we\npropose the combined use of an oxidizing (H2O2) and a complexing (NH3) agent.\nAt temperatures as low as 80 {\\deg}C, the presence of H2O2 and a low\nconcentration of NH3 favour the Ni2+/Co3+ over Ni2+/Co2+ oxidation states,\nshifting the product structure from brucite phase (temperatures > 80 {\\deg}C)\nto LDH. Conversely, for the NiFe-hydroxides the transition from LDH\n(temperatures < 80 {\\deg}C) to brucite phase (temperatures > 80 {\\deg}C) is\ncontrolled by the reaction temperature only. Due to the high stability of Fe3+,\nthe synthesis of NiFe products by CHFS does not require oxidizing and\ncomplexing agents, resulting in a robust process for large-scale production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 09:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-14"}

In this work, we investigate the\nobservational consequences of a simplistic model for super-Eddington accretion\nflows -- an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disc (AD) where the\ninner-most parts experience severe photon-trapping, which is enhanced with\nincreased accretion rate.

Since the\nreflection and transmission coefficients of the reflecting and refracting\nsurfaces in an optical system depend on the polarization of incoming rays, this\noptical polarization produces both (a) a selection bias in favor of galaxies\nwith specific orientations and (b) a polarization-dependent PSF. In this work\nwe build toy models to obtain for the first time an estimate for the impact of\npolarization on PSF shapes and the impact of the selection bias due to the\npolarization effect on the measurement of the ellipticity used in shear\nmeasurements.

The\nresulting model learns both the content and format (i.e., structure) of\nrelational representations from non-relational inputs without supervision, when\naugmented with the capacity for reinforcement learning, leverages these\nrepresentations to learn individual domains, and then generalizes to new\ndomains on the first exposure (i.e., zero-shot learning) via analogical\ninference. We demonstrate the capacity of the model to learn structured\nrelational representations from a variety of simple visual stimuli, and to\nperform cross-domain generalization between video games (Breakout and Pong) and\nbetween several psychological tasks.

Using NOEMA\nobservations at 1.37 mm with an angular resolution of ~0.\"42 (1 400 au at 3.33\nkpc), we derived the physical and chemical structure of the source. We modeled\nthe observed molecular abundances with the chemical evolution code MUSCLE\n(MUlti Stage ChemicaL codE). Results. With the kinetic temperature tracers\nCH3CN and H2CO we observe a temperature distribution with a power-law index of\nq = 0.41+-0.08. Using the visibilities of the continuum emission we derive a\ndensity structure with a power-law index of p = 1.7+-0.1. The hot core spectra\nreveal high molecular abundances and a rich diversity in complex molecules. The\nmajority of the molecules have an asymmetric spatial distribution around the\nforming protostar(s), which indicates a complex physical structure on scales <\n1 400 au. Using MUSCLE, we are able to explain the observed molecular abundance\nof 10 out of 14 modeled species at an estimated hot core chemical age of ~21\n100 years. In contrast to the observational analysis, our chemical modeling\npredicts a lower density power-law index of p < 1.4. Reasons for this\ndiscrepancy are discussed. Conclusions. Combining high spatial resolution\nobservations with detailed chemical modeling allows us to derive a concise\npicture of the physical and chemical structure of the famous AFGL 2591 hot\ncore. The next steps are to conduct a similar analysis for the whole CORE\nsample, and then use this analysis to constrain the chemical diversity in\nhigh-mass star formation to a much greater depth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 11:15:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

Alternatively, one can make a\nchoice based on theoretical arguments and simply fit the corresponding\nparameters to the observed data. In either case, different distributions can\ngive similar results and provide almost equivalent results. Model selection can\nbe more complicated when the goal is to describe a trend in the distribution of\na given variable.

Guidelines for\nre-entering objects call for a ground casualty risk no higher than 0.0001. To\ncomply with this requirement, satellites can be designed through a\ndesign-for-demise philosophy. Still, a spacecraft designed to demise has to\nsurvive the debris-populated space environment for many years. The demisability\nand the survivability of a satellite can both be influenced by a set of common\ndesign choices such as the material selection, the geometry definition, and the\nposition of the components. Within this context, two models have been developed\nto analyse the demise and the survivability of satellites. Given the competing\nnature of the demisability and the survivability, a multi-objective\noptimisation framework was developed, with the aim to identify trade-off\nsolutions for the preliminary design of satellites. As the problem is nonlinear\nand involves the combination of continuous and discrete variables, classical\nderivative based approaches are unsuited and a genetic algorithm was selected\ninstead. The genetic algorithm uses the developed demisability and\nsurvivability criteria as the fitness functions of the multi-objective\nalgorithm. The paper presents a test case, which considers the preliminary\noptimisation of tanks in terms of material, geometry, location, and number of\ntanks for a representative Earth observation mission. The configuration of the\nexternal structure of the spacecraft is fixed. Tanks were selected because they\nare sensitive to both design requirements: they represent critical components\nin the demise process and impact damage can cause the loss of the mission\nbecause of leaking and ruptures. The results present the possible trade off\nsolutions, constituting the Pareto front obtained from the multi-objective\noptimisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 11:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-14"}

Such a layer\ncould find its physical origination either in compositional stratification due\nto the accumulation of light elements at the top or the core or in thermal\nstratification due to the heat flux becoming locally sub-adiabatic. The exact\nproperties of this stably-stratified layer, namely its size $\\mathcal{H}_S$ and\nthe degree of its stratification characterised by the Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a\nfrequency $N$, are however uncertain and highly debated. A stable layer\nunderneath the CMB can have crucial dynamical impacts on the geodynamo. Because\nof the inhibition of the convective motions, a stable layer is expected to\nprimarily act as a low-pass filter on the magnetic field, smoothing out the\nrapidly-varying and small-scale features by skin effect. To investigate this\neffect more systematically, we compute 70 global geodynamo models varying the\nsize of the stably-stratified layer from 0 to 300~km and its amplitude from\n$N/\\Omega = 0$ to $N/\\Omega \\simeq 50$, $\\Omega$ being the rotation rate.

Decentralized voltage\ncontrollers attached to DGUs form our primary layer. Governed by an MPC--based\nEnergy Management System (EMS), our tertiary layer generates optimal power\nreferences and decision variables for DGUs.

An intermediary\nsecondary layer translates EMS power references into appropriate voltage\nsignals required by the primary layer.

Since load voltages are not\ndirectly enforced, their uniqueness is necessary for DGUs to produce reference\npowers handed down by the EMS. To this aim, we deduce a novel uniqueness\ncondition based only on local load parameters.

A natural scene image mainly involves two kinds of visual\nconcepts, objects and their relationships, which are equally essential to\nimage-text retrieval. Therefore, a good representation should account for both\nof them. In the light of recent success of scene graph in many CV and NLP tasks\nfor describing complex natural scenes, we propose to represent image and text\nwith two kinds of scene graphs: visual scene graph (VSG) and textual scene\ngraph (TSG), each of which is exploited to jointly characterize objects and\nrelationships in the corresponding modality. The image-text retrieval task is\nthen naturally formulated as cross-modal scene graph matching. Specifically, we\ndesign two particular scene graph encoders in our model for VSG and TSG, which\ncan refine the representation of each node on the graph by aggregating\nneighborhood information. As a result, both object-level and relationship-level\ncross-modal features can be obtained, which favorably enables us to evaluate\nthe similarity of image and text in the two levels in a more plausible way.

Furthermore, these\nalgorithms are designed with large-scales galaxy surveys in mind rather than\nsmall-scale, local galaxy environments, where attention to detail is important.\nHere we present a new simple group finder algorithm, TD-ENCLOSER, that finds\nthe group that encloses a target galaxy of interest.

The\nalgorithm assigns galaxies to peaks in the density field in order of density in\ndescending order (\"Top Down\") so that galaxy groups \"grow\" around the density\npeaks. Outliers in under-dense regions are prevented from joining groups by a\nspecified hard threshold, while outliers at the group edges are clipped below a\nsoft (blurred) interior density level. The group assignments are largely\ninsensitive to all free parameters apart from the hard density threshold and\nthe kernel standard deviation, although this is a known feature of\ndensity-based group finder algorithms, and operates with a computing speed that\nincreases linearly with the size of the input sample. In preparation for a\ncompanion paper, we also present a simple algorithm to select unique\nrepresentative groups when duplicates occur.

A more\nrobust classification is the slow/fast rotator classification which describes\nthe kinematic structure.

The significant benefits\nof platooning attracted huge interests from academia and industry, especially\nfrom logistics companies for utilizing platoons of \"long-body\" trailer trucks\nbecause of the huge cost savings. In this paper, we demonstrate that existing\nDSRC-based platooning solutions, however, fail to support formation of such\n\"long\" platoons consisting of typical trailer trucks because of the limited\ncommunication range of DSRC. To address this problem, we propose L-Platooning,\nthe first platooning protocol that enables seamless, reliable, and rapid\nformation of a long platoon. We introduce a novel concept called Virtual Leader\nthat refers to a vehicle that acts like a platoon leader to extend the coverage\nof the original platoon leader. A virtual leader election algorithm is\ndeveloped to effectively designate a virtual leader based on the novel metric\ncalled the Virtual Leader Quality Index (VLQI) which quantifies the\neffectiveness of a vehicle serving as a platoon leader. We also develop\nmechanisms for L-Platooning to support the vehicle join and leave maneuvers\nspecifically for a long platoon. Through extensive simulations using the\ncombination of Veins (Plexe) and SUMO, we demonstrate that L-Platooning enables\nlong-body trailer trucks to form a long platoon effectively and maintain the\ndesired inter-vehicle distance precisely. We also show that L-Platooning\nhandles seamlessly the vehicle join and leave maneuvers for a long platoon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 13:57:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 22:46:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 21:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

However,\nmagnon spin currents supported by conventional systems with uniform magnetic\norder have proven hard to control. An alternative approach that relies on\ntopologically protected magnonic edge states of spatially periodic magnetic\ntextures has recently emerged. A prime example of such textures is the\nferromagnetic skyrmion crystal which hosts chiral edge states providing a\nplatform for magnon spin currents. Here, we show, for the first time, an\nexternal magnetic field can drive a topological phase transition in the spin\nwave spectrum of a ferromagnetic skyrmion crystal. The topological phase\ntransition is signaled by the closing of a low-energy bulk magnon gap at a\ncritical field. In the topological phase, below the critical field, two\ntopologically protected chiral magnonic edge states lie within this gap, but\nthey unravel in the trivial phase, above the critical field. Remarkably, the\ntopological phase transition involves an inversion of two magnon bands that at\nthe $\\Gamma$ point correspond to the breathing and anticlockwise modes of the\nskyrmions in the crystal.

The\ngoal of CS-DLMA is to enable efficient and equitable spectrum sharing among a\ngroup of co-located heterogeneous wireless networks. Existing CSMA protocols,\nsuch as the medium access control (MAC) of WiFi, are designed for a homogeneous\nnetwork in which all nodes adopt the same protocol. Such protocols suffer from\nsevere performance degradation in a heterogeneous environment where there are\nnodes adopting other MAC protocols. CS-DLMA aims to circumvent this problem by\nmaking use of DRL. In particular, this paper adopts alpha-fairness as the\ngeneral objective of CS-DLMA. With alpha-fairness, CS-DLMA can achieve a range\nof different objectives when coexisting with other MACs by changing the value\nof alpha. A salient feature of CS-DLMA is that it can achieve these objectives\nwithout knowing the coexisting MACs through a learning process based on DRL.\nThe underpinning DRL technique in CS-DLMA is deep Q-network (DQN). However, the\nconventional DQN algorithms are not suitable for CS-DLMA due to their uniform\ntime-step assumption. In CSMA protocols, time steps are non-uniform in that the\ntime duration required for carrier sensing is smaller than the duration of data\ntransmission. This paper introduces a non-uniform time-step formulation of DQN\nto address this issue. Our simulation results show that CS-DLMA can achieve the\ngeneral alpha-fairness objective when coexisting with TDMA, ALOHA, and WiFi\nprotocols by adjusting its own transmission strategy. Interestingly, we also\nfind that CS-DLMA is more Pareto efficient than other CSMA protocols when\ncoexisting with WiFi.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 14:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-14"}

In light of this, we study the\nformation of PBHs by the collapse of overdense perturbations generated during a\nmodel of warm inflation. For our model, we find that the primordial curvature\npower spectrum is red-tilted (spectral index $n_s<1$) at the large scale (small\n$k$) and is consistent with the $n_s-r$ values allowed from the CMB\nobservations. Along with that, it has a blue-tilt ($n_s>1$) for the small PBH\nscales (large $k$), with a sufficiently large amplitude of the primordial\ncurvature power spectrum required to form PBHs. These features originate\nbecause of the inflaton's coupling with the other fields during warm inflation.\nWe discuss the role of the inflaton dissipation to the enhancement in the\nprimordial power spectrum at the PBH scales. We find that for some parameter\nrange of our warm inflation model, PBHs with mass $\\sim 10^3$ g can be formed\nwith significant abundance. Such tiny mass PBHs have a short lifetime $\\sim\n10^{-19}$ s and would have evaporated into Hawking radiation in the early\nUniverse.

In this paper we propose SYMBIOSIS,\na methodology that defines a goal elicitation and refinement process mapping\nbusiness objectives to security measurement goals via the use of systematic\ntemplates that capture relevant context elements (business goals, purpose,\nstakeholders, system scope). The novel contribution of SYMBIOSIS is the\nwell-defined process, which enforces that (1) metrics align with business\nobjectives via a top-down derivation that refines top-level business objectives\nto a manageable granularity (2) the impact of metrics on business objectives is\nexplicitly traced via a bottom-up feedback mechanism, allowing an incremental\napproach where feedback from metrics influences business goals, and vice-versa.\nIn this paper, we discuss the findings from applying SYMBIOSIS to three case\nstudies of known security incidents. Our analysis shows how the aforementioned\npitfalls of security metrics development processes affected the outcome of\nthese high-profile security incidents and how SYMBIOSIS addresses such issues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 15:54:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-14"}

This review aims to present a\ndetailed and inclusive study covering both the technical and non-technical\nchallenges and approaches of software sustainability.

The\nnon-technical level consists of documentation, sustainability manifestos,\ntraining of software engineers, funding software projects, and leadership\nskills of project managers to achieve sustainability.

First two models are introduced. A demisability model to predict the\nbehaviour of spacecraft components during the atmospheric re-entry and a\nsurvivability model to assess the vulnerability of spacecraft structures\nagainst space debris impacts. Two indices that evaluate the level of\ndemisability and survivability are also proposed. The two models are then used\nto study the sensitivity of the demisability and of the survivability indices\nas a function of typical design-for-demise options. The demisability and the\nsurvivability can in fact be influenced by the same design parameters in a\ncompeting fashion that is while the demisability is improved, the survivability\nis worsened and vice versa. The analysis shows how the design-for-demise\nsolutions influence the demisability and the survivability independently. In\naddition, the effect that a solution has simultaneously on the two criteria is\nassessed. Results shows which, among the design-for-demise parameters mostly\ninfluence the demisability and the survivability. For such design parameters\nmaps are presented, describing their influence on the demisability and\nsurvivability indices.

In the scheduling domain, it\nis common to model the behaviour of the machine by defining a small set of\nmachine modes, e.g. \"on\", \"off\" and \"stand-by\". Then the transitions between\nthe modes are represented by a static transition graph. In this paper, we argue\nthat this type of model might be too restrictive for some types of machines\n(e.g. the furnaces). For such machines, we propose to employ the complete\ntime-domain dynamics and integrate it into an idle energy function. This way,\nthe scheduling algorithm can exploit the full knowledge about the machine\ndynamics with minimised energy consumption encapsulated in this function. In\nthis paper, we study a scheduling problem, where the tasks characterised by\nrelease times and deadlines are scheduled in the given order such that the idle\nenergy consumption of the machine is minimised. We show that this problem can\nbe solved in polynomial time whenever the idle energy function is concave. To\nhighlight the practical applicability, we analyse a heat-intensive system\nemploying a steel-hardening furnace. We derive an energy optimal control law,\nand the corresponding idle energy function, for the bilinear system model\napproximating the dynamics of the furnace (and possibly other heat-intensive\nsystems). Further, we prove that the idle energy function is, indeed, concave\nin this case. Therefore, the proposed scheduling algorithm can be used.\nNumerical experiments show that by using our approach, combining both the\noptimal control and optimal scheduling, higher energy savings can be achieved,\ncompared to the state-of-the-art scheduling approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 10:13:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 06:43:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 08:37:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 05:33:22 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 13:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

In Australia, only 5%- 15% of advice documents are\naudited annually and 75% of these are found to be non-compliant(ASI 2018b).\nThis paper describes a pilot with an Australian government regulation agency\nwhere Artificial Intelligence (AI) models based on techniques such natural\nlanguage processing (NLP), machine learning and deep learning were developed to\nmethodically characterise the regulatory risk status of personal financial\nadvice documents. The solution provides traffic light rating of advice\ndocuments for various risk factors enabling comprehensive coverage of documents\nin the review and allowing rapid identification of documents that are at high\nrisk of non-compliance with government regulations. This pilot serves as a case\nstudy of public-private partnership in developing AI systems for government and\npublic sector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 05:50:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

Algebraically one can also\ndefine quasi-central sets near $e$ for dense subsemigroups of $(T, +)$. In a\ndense subsemigroup of $(T,+)$, C-sets near $e$ are the sets, which satisfy the\nconclusions of the central sets theorem near $e$. S. K. Patra gave dynamical\ncharacterizations of these combinatorially rich sets near zero. In this paper\nwe shall prove these dynamical characterizations for these combinatorially rich\nsets near $e$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 17:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

The emission of\nthis \"pinging\" spectral line would exist during the time that is determined by\nthe time of radiative energy loss by the optical electron. The amplitude of the\n\"pinging\" spectral line would be higher for the pulses with faster raising or\nfalling fronts. The simulations using our previously developed model confirmed\nexistence of the \"pinging\" spectral response.
