In two cases we show that there are no global anomalies beyond the\nWitten anomaly, while in the other cases we show that there are no global\nanomalies at all, illustrating the subtle interplay between local and global\nanomalies. While freedom from global anomalies has been previously shown for\nthe specific fermion content of the SM by embedding the SM in an anomaly-free\n$SU(5)$ GUT, our results here remain true when the SM fermion content is\nextended arbitrarily. Going beyond the SM gauge groups, we show that there are\nno new global anomalies in extensions of the (usual) SM gauge group by $U(1)^m$\nfor any integer $m$, which correspond to phenomenologically well-motivated BSM\ntheories featuring multiple $Z^\\prime$ bosons. Nor do we find any new global\nanomalies in various grand unified theories, including Pati-Salam and\ntrinification models. We also consider global anomalies in a family of theories\nwith gauge group $SU(N)\\times Sp(M)\\times U(1)$, which share the phase\nstructure of the SM for certain $(N, M)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 16:44:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:40:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 16:02:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

It is practical and intuitive to annotate temporal\nboundaries of a few examples and utilize them to help WTAL models better detect\nactions. However, the train-test discrepancy of action localization strategy\nprevents WTAL models from leveraging semi-supervision for further improvement.\nAt training time, attention or multiple instance learning is used to aggregate\npredictions of each snippet for video-level classification; at test time, they\nfirst obtain action score sequences over time, then truncate segments of scores\nhigher than a fixed threshold, and post-process action segments. The\ninconsistent strategy makes it hard to explicitly supervise the action\nlocalization model with temporal boundary annotations at training time.

The formation\nand subsequent decay of the latter further deplete the relic density during the\nfreeze-out process on top of the Sommerfeld enhancement, allowing for larger DM\nmasses.

Doping with a gadolinium chelate greatly\nreduced T1 and T2*, resulting in extremely short T1 values when the target T2*\nvalues were reached, while the attenuation coefficient was unchanged. Doping\nwith copper sulfate was more selective for T2* shortening and achieved\ncomparable T1 and T2* values to bone (after 1 week of drying), while the\nattenuation coefficient was unchanged.\n  Conclusions: Plaster doped with copper sulfate is a promising bone material\nanalogue for a PET/MRI phantom, mimicking the MR properties (T1 and T2*) and\n511 keV attenuation coefficient of human cortical bone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 17:47:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2020 04:38:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-17"}

The source is known to harbor a low mass black hole ($\\sim 10^4-\n{\\rm a~ few~}\\times 10^{5}~\\rm M_\\odot$) and shows strong variability in the\nfull X-ray range during these observations. We model the flux-resolved spectra\nof the source assuming three absorbing layers: neutral, mildly ionized, and\nhighly ionized ($N_{\\rm H} \\sim 1.6\\times 10^{22}-3.4 \\times 10^{23}~\\rm\ncm^{-2}$, $\\sim 0.8-7.8 \\times 10^{22}~\\rm cm^{-2}$, and $ 3.8 \\times\n10^{22}~\\rm cm^{-2}$, respectively. The source also shows intrinsic variability\nby a factor of $\\sim 3$, on short timescales, due to changes in the nuclear\nflux, assumed to be a power law ($\\Gamma = 1.6-1.67$). Our results show a\npositive correlation between the intrinsic flux and the absorbers' ionization\nparameter. The covering fraction of the neutral absorber varies during the\nfirst $XMM-Newton$ observation, which could explain the pronounced soft X-ray\nvariability. However, the source remains fully covered by this layer during the\nother two observations, largely suppressing the soft X-ray variability. This\nsuggests an inhomogeneous and layered structure in the broad line region. We\nalso find a difference in the characteristic timescale of the power spectra\nbetween different energy ranges and observations. We finally show simulated\nspectra with $XRISM$, $Athena$, and $eXTP$, which will allow us to characterize\nthe different absorbers, study their dynamics, and will help us identify their\nlocations and sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 17:51:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 22:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Collecting these annotations is laborious and costly,\nyet supervised models do not generalize well when testing on images from a\ndifferent distribution. Domain adaptation provides a solution by adapting\nexisting labels to the target testing data. However, a large gap between\ndomains could make adaptation a challenging task, which leads to unstable\ntraining processes and sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose to bridge\nthe domain gap with an intermediate domain and progressively solve easier\nadaptation subtasks. This intermediate domain is constructed by translating the\nsource images to mimic the ones in the target domain. To tackle the\ndomain-shift problem, we adopt adversarial learning to align distributions at\nthe feature level.

Recent\napproaches have made significant progress towards regressing the parameters of\nparametric human body models directly from images. Because of the absence of\nimages with 3D shape ground truth, relevant approaches rely on 2D annotations\nor sophisticated architecture designs. In this work, we advocate that there are\nmore cues we can leverage, which are available for free in natural images,\ni.e., without getting more annotations, or modifying the network architecture.\nWe propose a natural form of supervision, that capitalizes on the appearance\nconstancy of a person among different frames (or viewpoints). This seemingly\ninsignificant and often overlooked cue goes a long way for model-based pose\nestimation. The parametric model we employ allows us to compute a texture map\nfor each frame. Assuming that the texture of the person does not change\ndramatically between frames, we can apply a novel texture consistency loss,\nwhich enforces that each point in the texture map has the same texture value\nacross all frames. Since the texture is transferred in this common texture map\nspace, no camera motion computation is necessary, or even an assumption of\nsmoothness among frames. This makes our proposed supervision applicable in a\nvariety of settings, ranging from monocular video, to multi-view images. We\nbenchmark our approach against strong baselines that require the same or even\nmore annotations that we do and we consistently outperform them.\nSimultaneously, we achieve state-of-the-art results among model-based pose\nestimation approaches in different benchmarks.

While\nthese features are strongly constrained by periodicity for models with only a\nsingle axion, mixing has been used in the literature (sometimes incorrectly) to\ntry to evade some of these constraints. In this paper, we ask whether it is\npossible to use axion mixing to generate an EFT of axions that evades these\nconstraints by flowing to a theory of a non-compact scalar in the IR. We\nconclude that as long as the light axion is exactly massless, it will inherit\nthe periodicity and associated constraints of the UV theory. However, by giving\nthe light axion a mass, we can relax these constraints with effects\nproportional to the axion mass squared, including non-quantized couplings and\nthe realignment of monodromy to a light axion with a larger field range. To\nshow this, we consider various examples of axions mixing with other axions or\nwith non-compact scalar fields, and work in a basis where coupling quantization\nis manifest. This basis makes it clear that in the case where an axion is eaten\nthrough the Higgs or Stuckelberg mechanism, the light axion does not have a\nlarge effective field range, in contrast to some recent claims in the\nliterature.

To this end,\nthis paper proposes an underwater cooperative MIMO communication mechanism,\nwhich is based on a hybrid acoustic and Magnetic Induction (MI) technique. The\ninter-node synchronization problem can be perfectly solved by using the MI\ntechnique so that the distributed acoustic transducers can cooperatively form\nnarrow beams for long distance underwater communications. The synchronization\ntime and errors are significantly reduced since MI has negligible signal\npropagation delays. To quantitatively analyze the improvement, the closed-form\nexpressions of the synchronization error, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),\neffective communication time, and throughput of the proposed system are\nrigorously derived. The proposed hybrid system is implemented in a\nsoftware-defined testbed under the beamforming and space-time coding scheme.\nThrough both numerical analysis and real-world experiments, the paper shows\nthat the proposed hybrid cooperative MIMO mechanism achieves much lower bit\nerror rate and synchronization error than the conventional acoustic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 18:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-28"}

The Izhikevich\nmodel is one of the simplest biologically plausible models, i.e. capable of\ncapturing the most recognized firing patterns of neurons. This property makes\nthe model efficient in simulating the large-scale networks of neurons.\nImproving the Izhikevich model for adapting to the neuronal activity of the rat\nbrain with great accuracy would make the model effective for future neural\nnetwork implementations. Methods- Data sampling from two brain regions, the HIP\nand BLA, was performed by the extracellular recordings of male rats, and spike\nsorting was conducted by Plexon offline sorter. Further analyses were performed\nthrough NeuroExplorer and MATLAB. To optimize the Izhikevich model parameters,\na genetic algorithm was used. The process of comparison in each iteration leads\nto the survival of better populations until achieving the optimum solution.\nResults- In the present study, the possible firing patterns of the real single\nneurons of the HIP and BLA were identified. Additionally, an improved\nIzhikevich model was achieved. Accordingly, the real neuronal spiking pattern\nof these regions neurons and the corresponding cases of the Izhikevich neuron\nspiking pattern were adjusted with great accuracy. Conclusion- This study was\nconducted to elevate our knowledge of neural interactions in different\nstructures of the brain and accelerate the quality of future large-scale neural\nnetwork simulations, as well as reducing the modeling complexity. This aim was\nachievable by performing the improved Izhikevich model, and inserting only the\nplausible firing patterns, and eliminating unrealistic ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 19:04:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 00:02:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 05:22:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2021 20:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

Using 2D\nparticle-in-cell simulations, we study proton acceleration in axisymmetric\npulsar magnetospheres. Protons and electrons are extracted from the neutron\nstar surface by the strong electric field induced by the rotation of the star,\nand electrons and positrons are produced in the magnetosphere through pair\nproduction process. As pair production has a crucial impact on electromagnetic\nfields, on gaps and thus on particle acceleration, we study its influence on\nthe maximum energy and luminosity of protons escaping the magnetosphere.\nProtons are accelerated and escape in all our simulations.

In contrast, protons gain most of their kinetic energy\nbelow the light-cylinder radius within the separatrix current layers, but they\nare not confined within the equatorial current sheet.

In addition, the\napproach addresses key deficiencies in existing model-reduction techniques,\ne.g., the dependence of LSPG and space-time LSPG projection on the time\ndiscretization and the exponential growth in time exhibited by a posteriori\nerror bounds for both Galerkin and LSPG projection.

For each type of trial\nsubspace, we consider two different solution techniques: direct (i.e.,\ndiscretize then optimize) and indirect (i.e., optimize then discretize).\nNumerical experiments conducted using trial subspaces characterized by spatial\ndimension reduction demonstrate that the WLS approach can yield more accurate\nsolutions with lower space-time residuals than Galerkin and LSPG projection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 19:17:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-28"}

We observe that impurities\nprogressively suppress the global superconducting gap and introduce low energy\nstates near the gap edge, with the superconductivity remaining in the\nstrong-coupling limit. Unexpectedly, the fully opened gap evolves into a nodal\nstate before the Cooper pair coherence is fully destroyed.

The mechanisms we\nconsider are the presence of quantum dots, inhomogeneous potential, random\ndisorder in the chemical potential, random fluctuations in the superconducting\ngap, and in the effective $g$ factor with the self-energy renormalization\ninduced by the parent superconductor in both short ($L\\sim1~\\mu$m) and long\nnanowires ($L\\sim3~\\mu$m). We classify all foregoing theoretical results for\nzero-bias conductance peaks into three types: the good, the bad, and the ugly,\naccording to the physical mechanisms producing the zero-bias peaks and their\ntopological properties. We find that, although the topological Majorana zero\nmodes are immune to weak disorder, strong disorder (ugly) completely suppresses\ntopological superconductivity and generically leads to trivial zero bias peaks.\nCompared qualitatively with the extensive existing experimental results in the\nsuperconductor-semiconductor nanowire structures, we conclude that most current\nexperiments are likely exploring trivial zero-bias peaks in the ugly situation\ndominated by strong disorder. We also study the nonlocal end-to-end correlation\nmeasurement in both the short and long wires, and point out the limitation of\nthe nonlocal correlation in ascertaining topological properties particularly\nwhen applied to short wires. The goal of the work is to establish with a very\nhigh confidence level the real physical possibility that essentially all\nexperimentally observed zero bias peaks in Majorana nanowires are most likely\nugly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 20:25:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 16:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-03"}

The unrolled model incorporates a\nnon-uniform FFT operator to perform the data consistency operation, and the\nregularization term is learned by a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on\nthe proximal gradient descent algorithm.

A main\nline of theoretical pursuit has been percolation induced cascading failures,\nwhere interdependence between network layers is conveniently and tacitly\nassumed to be symmetric. In the real world, interdependent interactions are\ngenerally asymmetric. To uncover and quantify the impact of asymmetry in\ninterdependence on network robustness, we focus on percolation dynamics in\ndouble-layer systems and implement the following failure mechanism: once a node\nin a network layer fails, the damage it can cause depends not only on its\nposition in the layer but also on the position of its counterpart neighbor in\nthe other layer. We find that the characteristics of the percolation transition\ndepend on the degree of asymmetry, where the striking phenomenon of a switch in\nthe nature of the phase transition from first- to second-order arises. We\nderive a theory to calculate the percolation transition points in both network\nlayers, as well as the transition switching point, with strong numerical\nsupport from synthetic and empirical networks.

Our\nfindings show that non-mobile repositories have a higher number of commits per\nmonth and our regression models suggest that being mobile significantly impacts\non the number of commits in a negative direction when controlling for confound\nfactors, such as code size. We also found that developers do not usually change\nsource code files together with build or test files. We argue that our results\ncan provide valuable information for developers on how changes are performed in\ndifferent platforms so that practices adopted in successful software systems\ncan be followed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 21:36:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-28"}

The work is motivated by the observation that classifier predictions\nfor real world datasets often demonstrate drastically different metrics, such\nas accuracy, when subdivided by specific sensitive variable subgroups. The\nreasons for these discrepancies are varied and not limited to the influence of\nmitigating variables, institutional bias, underlying population distributions\nas well as sampling bias. Among the numerous definitions of fairness that\nexist, we argue that at a minimum, principled ML practices should ensure that\nclassification predictions are able to mirror the underlying sub-population\ndistributions. However, as the number of sensitive variables increase,\npopulations meeting at the intersectionality of these variables may simply not\nexist or may not be large enough to provide accurate samples for\nclassification. In these increasingly likely scenarios, we make the case for\nhuman intervention and applying situational and individual definitions of\nfairness. In this paper we present lower bounds of subgroup sample complexity\nfor metric-fair learning based on the theory of Probably Approximately Metric\nFair Learning. We demonstrate that for a classifier to approach a definition of\nfairness in terms of specific sensitive variables, adequate subgroup population\nsamples need to exist and the model dimensionality has to be aligned with\nsubgroup population distributions. In cases where this is not feasible, we\npropose an approach using individual fairness definitions for achieving\nalignment. We look at two commonly explored UCI datasets under this lens and\nsuggest human interventions for data collection for specific subgroups to\nachieve approximate individual fairness for linear hypotheses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 23:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-28"}

Moreover, an efficient scalable parallel sweep algorithm for use on\ngeneral unstructured meshes remains elusive.

Models\nare usually separately developed for the two tasks, since sequence labeling\nmodels, the most widely used backbone for flat NER, are only able to assign a\nsingle label to a particular token, which is unsuitable for nested NER where a\ntoken may be assigned several labels.\n  In this paper, we propose a unified framework that is capable of handling\nboth flat and nested NER tasks. Instead of treating the task of NER as a\nsequence labeling problem, we propose to formulate it as a machine reading\ncomprehension (MRC) task. For example, extracting entities with the\n\\textsc{per} label is formalized as extracting answer spans to the question\n\"{\\it which person is mentioned in the text?}\". This formulation naturally\ntackles the entity overlapping issue in nested NER: the extraction of two\noverlapping entities for different categories requires answering two\nindependent questions. Additionally, since the query encodes informative prior\nknowledge, this strategy facilitates the process of entity extraction, leading\nto better performances for not only nested NER, but flat NER.\n  We conduct experiments on both {\\em nested} and {\\em flat} NER datasets.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation.\nWe are able to achieve vast amount of performance boost over current SOTA\nmodels on nested NER datasets, i.e., +1.28, +2.55, +5.44, +6.37, respectively\non ACE04, ACE05, GENIA and KBP17, along with SOTA results on flat NER datasets,\ni.e.,+0.24, +1.95, +0.21, +1.49 respectively on English CoNLL 2003, English\nOntoNotes 5.0, Chinese MSRA, Chinese OntoNotes 4.0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 01:06:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 01:26:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 10:30:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 07:24:34 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 09:01:21 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 23 May 2020 11:03:34 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 08:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-23"}

Among\nimage composition tasks, image blending aims to seamlessly blend an object from\na source image onto a target image with lightly mask adjustment. A popular\napproach is Poisson image blending, which enforces the gradient domain\nsmoothness in the composite image. However, this approach only considers the\nboundary pixels of target image, and thus can not adapt to texture of target\nimage. In addition, the colors of the target image often seep through the\noriginal source object too much causing a significant loss of content of the\nsource object. We propose a Poisson blending loss that achieves the same\npurpose of Poisson image blending. In addition, we jointly optimize the\nproposed Poisson blending loss as well as the style and content loss computed\nfrom a deep network, and reconstruct the blending region by iteratively\nupdating the pixels using the L-BFGS solver.

In the quest for new organic superalkalis, we study\nthe MC6Li6 (M = Li, Na, and K) complexes and their cations by decorating\nhexalithiobenzene with an alkali atom using density functional theory. All\nMC6Li6 complexes are planar and stable against dissociation into M + C6Li6\nfragments, irrespective of their charge. These complexes are stabilized by\ncharge transfer from M to C6Li6, although the back-donation of charges tends to\ndestabilize neutral species.

The adiabatic ionization energies of MC6Li6\n(3.08-3.22 eV) and vertical electron affinities of MC6Li6+ (3.04-3.15 eV)\nsuggest that MC6Li6 species form a new series of aromatic superalkalis.

Herein, considering simultaneous cocoon formation, we study\nthe stability of relativistic jets propagating through the uniform ambient\nmedium. Using a simple analytic argument, we demonstrate that independent from\nthe jet launching condition, the effective inertia of the jet is larger than\nthat of the cocoon when the fully relativistic jet oscillates radially owing to\nthe pressure mismatch between jet and cocoon. In such situations, it is\nexpected that the onset condition for the oscillation-induced Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstability is satisfied at the jet interface, resulting in the destabilization\nof the relativistic jet during its propagation. We have quantitatively verified\nand confirmed our prior expectation by performing relativistic hydrodynamic\nsimulations in three dimensions.

However, a\nrectangle ($1 \\times 2$) representation is more suitable for such models than\nthe square representation because of evacuees' shoulder width. The rectangle\nrepresentation gives two new features to evacuees' behaviors: moving sideways\nand turning. We study the effects of these behaviors on crowd evacuation\ndynamics. Hence, we constructed a cellular automaton model where evacuees whose\nshoulder widths are $1 \\times 2$ try to escape from a room in an emergency\nsituation.

In contrast, Rumble uses\nJSONiq, a standardized language specifically designed for querying JSON\ndocuments. The key challenge in the design and implementation of Rumble is\nmapping the recursive structure of JSON documents and JSONiq queries onto\nSpark's execution primitives based on tabular data frames. Our solution is to\ntranslate a JSONiq expression into a tree of iterators that dynamically switch\nbetween local and distributed execution modes depending on the nesting level.\nBy overcoming the impedance mismatch in the engine, Rumble frees the user from\nsolving the same problem for every single query, thus increasing their\nproductivity considerably.

Such method can be harnessed to provide\nvarious services to better manage and control energy consumption (optimal\nplanning and saving). NILM has been traditionally approached from signal\nprocessing and electrical engineering perspectives. Recently, machine learning\nhas started to play an important role in NILM. While most work has focused on\nsupervised algorithms, unsupervised approaches can be more interesting and of\npractical use in real case scenarios.

The main\ninsight originates from Myerson's work on mutual consent in link formation and\nhis main conclusion that the empty network (the network without any links)\nalways emerges as a strong Nash equilibrium in any game-theoretic model of\nnetwork formation under mutual consent and positive link formation costs.\nJackson and Wolinsky introduced a cooperative framework to avoid this main\npitfall.

Unfortunately, this notion of\npairwise stability requires coordinated action by pairs of decision makers in\nlink formation.

If the type check succeeds, it is safe to ignore the SMR\nalgorithm and consider the program under garbage collection. Intuitively, our\ntypes track the protection of pointers as guaranteed by the SMR algorithm.\nThere are two design decisions. The type system does not track any shape\ninformation, which makes it extremely lightweight. Instead, we rely on\ninvariant annotations that postulate a protection by the SMR. To this end, we\nintroduce angels, ghost variables with an angelic semantics. Moreover, the SMR\nalgorithm is not hard-coded but a parameter of the type system definition. To\nachieve this, we rely on a recent specification language for SMR algorithms.\nOur second contribution is to automate the type inference and the invariant\ncheck. For the type inference, we show a quadratic-time algorithm. For the\ninvariant check, we give a source-to-source translation that links our programs\nto off-the-shelf verification tools. It compiles away the angelic semantics.\nThis allows us to infer appropriate annotations automatically in a\nguess-and-check manner.

It is a smaller version of 24 X 36 pixelated sensor in\ncomparison to the earlier generation of ATLASPix1 fabricated in both ams AG,\nAustria, and TSI Semiconductors, USA. While ams produced ATLASPix2 showed\nbreakdown voltage 50 V in nonirradiated condition as it was seen on its\npredecessors ATLASpix1, TSI produced prototypes reported breakdown voltage\ngreater than 100 V. The chosen wafer of MCz 20 Ohm.cm P-type substrate\nresistivity can deplete a few tenths of um, where the process-driven surface\ndamage can have a greater impact on device operating conditions before and\nafter irradiation. In an aim to understand device intrinsic performance at the\nirradiated case, a dedicated neutron irradiation campaign has been made at JSI\nfor different fluences. Characterizations have been performed at different\ntemperatures after irradiation to analyze the leakage current and breakdown\nvoltage before and after irradiation. TSI prototypes showed a breakdown voltage\ndecrease 90 V due to impact ionization and enhanced effective doping\nconcentration. Results demonstrated for the neutron-irradiated devices up to\nthe fluence of 2 X 10^15 neq/cm2 can still safely be operated at a voltage high\nenough to allow for high efficiency. Accelerated Annealing steps also made on\nselective irradiated ATLASPix2 samples, equivalent to more than two years of\nroom-temperature annealing (at 20 degC), and they showed the reassuring\nexpected breakdown voltage increase and damage constant rate alpha^* (geometry\ndependent) decrease, driven by the beneficial annealing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 14:19:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 16:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

The notion was introduced by Erd{\\\"{o}}s and Simonovits in\n1973. Since then the parameter has been studied extensively in combinatorics,\nalso the particular case when $H$ is a star graph. Recently this case received\nthe attention of researchers from the algorithm community because of its\napplications in interface modelling of wireless networks. To the algorithm\ncommunity, the problem is known as maximum edge $q$-colouring problem.\n  In this paper, we study the maximum edge $2$-colouring problem from the\napproximation algorithm point of view. The case $q=2$ is particularly\ninteresting due to its application in real-life problems. Algorithmically, this\nproblem is known to be NP-hard for $q\\ge 2$. For the case of $q=2$, it is also\nknown that no polynomial-time algorithm can approximate to a factor less than\n$3/2$ assuming the unique games conjecture. Feng et al. showed a\n$2$-approximation algorithm for this problem. Later Adamaszek and Popa\npresented a $5/3$-approximation algorithm with the additional assumption that\nthe input graph has a perfect matching. Note that the obvious but the only\nknown algorithm issues different colours to the edges of a maximum matching\n(say $M$) and different colours to the connected components of $G \\setminus M$.\nIn this article, we give a new analysis of the aforementioned algorithm leading\nto an improved approximation bound for triangle-free graphs with perfect\nmatching. We also show a new lower bound when the input graph is triangle-free.\nThe contribution of the paper is a completely new, deeper and closer analysis\nof how the optimum achieves a higher number of colours than the matching based\nalgorithm, mentioned above.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 14:23:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-28"}

To this end, the Lyapunov theory provides a useful description of\nturbulence through the study of the perturbation dynamics. In this work, the\nLyapunov spectrum of forced homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows is computed.\nUsing the Lyapunov exponents of a flow at different Reynolds numbers, the\nscaling of the dimension of the chaotic attractor for a three-dimensional\nhomogeneous isotropic flow (HIT) is obtained for the first time through direct\ncomputation. The obtained Gram-Schmidt vectors (GSV) are analyzed.

At zero magnetic field, the\nelectron spin noise spectra exhibit a two-peak structure - a zero-frequency\nline and a satellite - that we attribute to the electron spin precession in a\nfrozen random nuclear spin distribution. This implies a surprisingly long\nelectron spin correlation time whatever the doping level, even above the Mott\ntransition. Using spatiotemporal spin noise spectroscopy, we demonstrate that\nthe observation of a satellite in the spin noise spectra and a fast spin\ndiffusion are mutually exclusive. This is consistent with a shortening of the\nelectron spin correlation time due to hopping between donors. We interpret our\ndata via a model assuming that the low temperature spin relaxation is due to\nhopping between donors in presence of hyperfine and anisotropic exchange\ninteractions. Most of our results can be interpreted in this framework. First,\na transition from inhomogeneous to homogeneous broadening of the spin noise\npeaks and the disappearance of the satellite are observed when the hopping rate\nbecomes larger than the Larmor period induced by the local nuclear fields. In\nthe regime of homogeneous broadening the ratio between the spin diffusion\nconstant and the spin relaxation rate has a value in good agreement with the\nDresselhaus constant. In the regime of inhomogeneous broadening, most of the\nsamples exhibit a broadening consistent with the distribution of local nuclear\nfields. We obtain a new estimate of the hyperfine constants in CdTe and a value\nof 0.10 Tesla for the maximum nuclear field. Finally, our study also reveals a\npuzzle as our samples behave as if the active donor concentration was reduced\nby several orders of magnitudes with respect to the nominal values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 15:39:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-28"}

The aim of this study is to obtain\nthe age of the open cluster NGC 6910 by means of ensemble asteroseismology of\nthe early-type pulsating members, to derive their stellar parameters, and to\nclassify the excited modes. We used time-series analysis, performed photometric\nand spectroscopic mode identification, and calculated grids of evolutionary and\nseismic models to apply the procedure of ensemble asteroseismology for nine\npulsating members of NGC 6910.

In this model, to search a data base\nof N entries, the number of qubits grows from n to 2n, but there is a huge\nreduction in time complexity. Physically, this can be understood as the effect\nof weak value amplification that arises due to the pre- and postselection of\nthe ancillary register which interacts with the n qubit register where quantum\nsearch is performed. This effectively accelerates the computation and takes the\nstate of quantum computer much ahead in time, compared to what one would obtain\nwithout weak value amplification and post-selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 12:59:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 2019 15:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

We also advocate for interpreting the cosmological\nconstant, dark matter, baryogenesis, and inflation as four \"mysteries of the\ncosmos\" that are indeterminate regarding new particles or interactions, despite\na multitude of available particle explanations. Some history of the\never-changing SM is also presented to remind us that today's SM is not our\nparents' SM, nor will it likely be our children's SM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 13:58:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 19:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-25"}

The proposed photodetector incorporates the\nlong-range dielectric-loaded surface plasmon polariton (LR-DLSPP) waveguide\nwith a metal stripe serving simultaneously as a plasmon supporting metallic\nmaterial and one of the metal electrodes. Large in-plane component of the\ntransverse magnetic (TM) plasmonic mode can couple efficiently to the graphene\ncausing large temperature increases across an entire graphene channel with a\nmaximum located at the metal stripe edge. As a result, the electronic\ntemperatures exceeding 12000K at input power of only a few tens of {\\mu}W can\nbe obtained at the telecom wavelength of 1550nm. Even with limitations such as\nthe melting temperature of graphene (T= 4510 K), a responsivity exceeding at\nleast 200 A/W is achievable at telecom wavelength of 1550 nm. It is also shown\nthat under certain operation conditions, the PTE channel photocurrent can be\nisolated from photovoltaic and p-n junction PTE contributions providing an\nefficient way for optimizing the overall photodetector performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 15:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

This paper presents\nmulti-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) based models to study the\nmedium access control (MAC) layer performance of the IEEE 802.11p standard and\nC-V2X Mode 4. These models are coupled with an appropriate DTMC based queuing\nmodel, and traffic generators for periodic cooperative awareness messages\n(CAMs) and event-driven decentralized environmental notification messages\n(DENMs). Closed-form solutions for the steady-state probabilities of the models\nare obtained, which are then utilized to derive expressions for several key\nperformance metrics. An application for a highway scenario is presented to\nprovide numerical results and to draw insights on the performance. In\nparticular, a performance comparison between IEEE 802.11p and C-V2X Mode 4 in\nterms of the average delay, the collision probability, and the channel\nutilization is presented. The results show that IEEE 802.11p is superior in\nterms of average delay, whereas C-V2X Mode 4 excels in collision resolution.\nThe paper also includes design insights on possible future MAC layer\nperformance enhancements of both standards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 20:30:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 13:09:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 11:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

As cars\ngradually become part of the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, several\nstakeholders discover the value of in-vehicle network logs containing the\nmeasurements of the multitude of sensors deployed within the car. This wealth\nof data is also expected to be exploitable by third parties for the purpose of\nprofiling drivers in order to provide personalized, valueadded services.\nAlthough several prior works have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of\ndriver re-identification using the in-vehicle network data captured on the\nvehicle's CAN (Controller Area Network) bus, they inferred the identity of the\ndriver only from known sensor signals (such as the vehicle's speed, brake pedal\nposition, steering wheel angle, etc.) extracted from the CAN messages. However,\ncar manufacturers intentionally do not reveal exact signal location and\nsemantics within CAN logs. We show that the inference of driver identity is\npossible even with off-the-shelf machine learning techniques without\nreverse-engineering the CAN protocol.

To address this issue, we report the\ndevelopment of a novel fiber-based optoacoustic emitter (FOE). The FOE, a new\nminiaturized ultrasound source, is composed of an optical diffusion coating\nlayer and an expansion coating layer at an optical fiber distal end with a\ndiameter of approximately 500 microns. Taking advantage of the fiber size and\ndiffusive nanoparticles introduced, the ultrasound generated by the FOEs showed\na spatial confinement of sub-millimeter. The optoacoustic conversion efficiency\nwas maximized through choosing absorbing nanomaterials and thermal expansion\nmatrix. Controllable frequencies in the range of 0.083 MHz to 5.500 MHz were\nachieved through using the diffusion layer as a damping material or modifying\nthe nano-composition in the expansion layer. This sub-MHz frequency\ncontrollability allows FOEs to be used as a localized ultrasound source for\nprecise cell modulation. We demonstrated optoacoustic cell membrane\nsonoporation with a localization of sub-millimeter and negligible heat\ndeposition, implicating its broad biomedical applications, including\nregion-specific drug delivery, gene transfection as well as localized neuron\nstimulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 20:27:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}
