However, few\nresults consider decentralized heading control when the speed of heading\nadjustment is restricted. In this paper, we propose a simple hybrid-dynamical\nmodel based on pulse-coupled oscillators for decentralized heading control in\nmobile robots while accounting for the constraint on the rate of heading\nchange. The pulse-coupled oscillator model is effective in coordinating the\nphase of oscillator networks and hence is promising for robotic heading\ncoordination given that both phase and heading evolve on the same\none-dimensional torus. However, existing pulse-coupled oscillator results\nrequire the phase adjustment to be instantaneous, which cannot hold for robot\nheading adjustment due to physical limitations. We propose a generalization to\nthe standard pulse-coupled oscillator model to allow for the phase to adjust at\na finite rate, yet still have the oscillator network converge to the desired\nstate, making our approach applicable to robotic heading coordination under\nrate constraints. We provide rigorous mathematical proof for the achievement of\nboth synchronized and desynchronized heading relationships, and experimentally\nverify the results using extensive tests on a multi-robot platform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 16:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-17"}

In\nthis paper, new investigations of the composition of Ganymede's surface at\nglobal scale are presented. The analyses are derived from the linear spectral\nmodeling of a high spectral resolution dataset, acquired with the near-infrared\nground-based integral field spectrometer SINFONI of the VLT. We find that the\nOren-Nayar (1994) model, generalizing the Lambert's law for rough surfaces,\nproduces excellent photometric corrections. Modeling confirms that Ganymede's\nsurface composition is dominated by H2O-ice, mostly crystalline, as well as a\ndarkening agent, but it also highlights the necessity of secondary species to\nbetter fit the measurements: sulfuric acid hydrate and salts. A latitudinal\ngradient and a hemispherical dichotomy are the strongest spatial patterns\nobserved for the darkening agent, the H2O-ice, and the sulfuric acid: the\ndarkening agent is the major compound at the equator and mid-latitudes,\nespecially on the trailing hemisphere, while the H2O-ice and the sulfuric acid\nare mostly located at high latitudes and on the leading hemisphere. This\nanti-correlation is likely a consequence of the bombardment of the constituents\nin the Jovian magnetosphere which are more intense at higher latitudes.\nFurthermore, the modeling confirms that polar caps are enriched in small,\nfresh, H2O-ice grains while equatorial regions are composed of larger grains.\nFinally, the spatial distribution of the salts is neither related to the Jovian\nmagnetospheric bombardment nor the craters. These species are mostly detected\non bright grooved terrains surrounding darker areas. Endogenous processes, such\nas freezing of upwelling fluids in the ice shell, may explain this\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 16:05:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-17"}

Compared with pure CAVs, the major challenge is how to\nhandle the prediction uncertainty of HDVs, which can cause significant state\ndeviation of CAVs from planned trajectories. In most existing studies, model\npredictive control (MPC) is utilized to replan CAVs' trajectories to mitigate\nthe deviation at each time step. However, as the replan process is usually\nconducted by solving an optimization problem with information through\ninter-vehicular communication, MPC methods suffer from heavy computational and\ncommunicational burdens.

The prediction\nuncertainty is dynamically mitigated by the feedback control and restricted\ninside a set with a high probability. When the uncertainty exceeds the set or\nadditional external disturbance emerges, the feedforward control is triggered\nto plan a ``tube'' (a sequence of the set), which can bound CAVs' actual\ntrajectories. As the replan process is usually not required, the proposed\nmethod is much more efficient regarding computation and communication, compared\nwith the MPC method. Comprehensive simulations are provided to validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 17:08:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2020 03:37:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 14:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

We show that this state\nfactorizes between positively and negatively charged modes and demonstrate that\nthis fact can be used to relate it, for each momentum mode separately, to two\nuncharged thermofield double states with shifted temperatures and times. We\nevaluate the complexity of formation for the charged thermofield double state,\nboth numerically and in certain analytic expansions. We further present\nnumerical results for the time dependence of complexity. We compare various\naspects of these results to those obtained in holography for charged black\nholes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 17:50:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 10:25:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-01"}

In the first part of this thesis we\nstudy the interparticle potentials generated by the interactions between\nspin-1/2 sources that are mediated by spin-1 particles in the limit of low\nmomentum transfer. We investigate different representations of spin-1 particle\nto see how it modifies the profiles of the interparticle potentials and we also\ninclude in our analysis all types of couplings between fermionic currents and\nthe mediator boson. The spin- and velocity-dependent interparticle potentials\nthat we obtain can be used to explain effects possibly associated to new\nmacroscopic forces such as modifications of the inverse-square law and possible\nspin-gravity coupling effects. The second part of this thesis is based on the\ndark matter phenomenology of well-motivated $U(1)'$ extensions of the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model.

An appealing and promising pathway to their\nformation is the direct collapse scenario of a primordial gas in atomic-cooling\nhaloes at z ~ 10 - 20, when the $\\rm H_2$ formation is inhibited by a strong\nbackground radiation field, whose intensity exceeds a critical value, $J_{\\rm\ncrit}$. To estimate $J_{\\rm crit}$, typically, studies have assumed idealized\nspectra, with a fixed ratio of $\\rm H_{2}$ photo-dissociation rate $k_{\\rm\nH_2}$ to the $\\rm H^-$ photo-detachment rate $k_{\\rm H^-}$.

For most partial differential equation (PDE)\nsimulators, the outputs of interest are often spatial or spatial-temporal\nfields, leading to very high-dimensional outputs. Despite the success of\nexisting data-driven surrogates for high-dimensional outputs, most methods\nrequire a significant number of samples to cover the response surface in order\nto achieve a reasonable degree of accuracy. This demand makes the idea of\nsurrogate models less attractive considering the high computational cost to\ngenerate the data.

Without a systematic\nmethodology for working with such datasets, there is a valid concern that\nanalyses will produce noise artifacts rather than true effects. In this paper,\nwe offer a way to enable researchers to systematically build models and\nidentify novel phenomena in large datasets. One traditional approach is to\nanalyze the residuals of models---the biggest errors they make in predicting\nthe data---to discover what might be missing from those models. However, once a\ndataset is sufficiently large, machine learning algorithms approximate the true\nunderlying function better than the data, suggesting instead that the\npredictions of these data-driven models should be used to guide model-building.\nWe call this approach \"Scientific Regret Minimization\" (SRM) as it focuses on\nminimizing errors for cases that we know should have been predictable. We\ndemonstrate this methodology on a subset of the Moral Machine dataset, a public\ncollection of roughly forty million moral decisions. Using SRM, we found that\nincorporating a set of deontological principles that capture dimensions along\nwhich groups of agents can vary (e.g. sex and age) improves a computational\nmodel of human moral judgment. Furthermore, we were able to identify and\nindependently validate three interesting moral phenomena: criminal\ndehumanization, age of responsibility, and asymmetric notions of\nresponsibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 19:25:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 00:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}

Applications of these types of automata include software security\nanalysis and natural language processing. While these models provide means to\ndescribe words over infinite input alphabets, there is no considerable work on\nsymbolic output (as present in transducers) alphabets, or even abstraction\n(widening) thereof. Furthermore, established approaches for transforming, for\nexample, minimizing or reducing, finite-state machines that produce output on\nstates or transitions are not applicable. A notion of equivalence of this type\nof machines is needed to make statements about whether or not transformations\nmaintain the semantics. We present abstract transducers as a new form of\nfinite-state transducers. Both their input alphabet and the output alphabet is\ncomposed of abstract words, where one abstract word represents a set of\nconcrete words. The mapping between these representations is described by\nabstract word domains. By using words instead of single letters, abstract\ntransducers provide the possibility of lookaheads to decide on state\ntransitions to conduct. Since both the input symbol and the output symbol on\neach transition is an abstract entity, abstraction techniques can be applied\nnaturally. We apply abstract transducers as the foundation for sharing task\nartifacts for reuse in context of program analysis and verification, and\ndescribe task artifacts as abstract words. A task artifact is any entity that\ncontributes to an analysis task and its solution, for example, candidate\ninvariants or source code to weave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 19:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-18"}

While the favoured scenario is delayed revival of the stalled shock\nby neutrino heating, it is difficult to reliably compute explosion outcomes and\nenergies, which depend sensitively on the complex radiation hydrodynamics of\nthe post-shock region. The dynamics of the (non-)explosion depend sensitively\non how energy is transported from inside and near the proto-neutron star (PNS)\nto material just behind the supernova shock. Although most of the PNS energy is\nlost in the form of neutrinos, hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic waves can also\ncarry energy from the PNS to the shock. We show that gravity waves excited by\ncore PNS convection can couple with outgoing acoustic waves that present an\nappreciable source of energy and pressure in the post-shock region. Using\none-dimensional simulations, we estimate the gravity wave energy flux excited\nby PNS convection and the fraction of this energy transmitted upward to the\npost-shock region as acoustic waves.

The hierarchical approach enables us to reason both in terms\nof high-level language instructions describing long time horizons and\nlow-level, complex, continuous state/action spaces required for real-time\ncontrol of a self-driving car. We train our policy with conditional imitation\nlearning from realistic language data collected from human drivers and\nnavigators. Through quantitative and interactive experiments within the CARLA\nframework, we show that our model can successfully interpret language\ninstructions and follow them safely, even when generalizing to previously\nunseen environments.

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical\nramp merging system that not only generates microscopic cooperative maneuvers\nfor CAVs on the ramp to merge into the mainline traffic flow, but also provides\ncontrollability of the ramp inflow rate, thereby enabling macroscopic traffic\nflow control. A centralized optimal control-based approach is proposed to\nsmooth the merging flow, improve the system-wide mobility, and decrease the\noverall fuel consumption of the network. Linear quadratic trackers in both\nfinite horizon and receding horizon forms are developed to solve the\noptimization problem in terms of path planning and sequence determination,\nwhere a microscopic vehicle fuel consumption model is applied.

Our goal is to examine the interaction between\nthe submesoscale and the turbulent finescale, and better characterize vertical\ntransport, frontogenesis and dissipative processes. The flow passes through\nsymmetric and baroclinic instabilities, spawns vortex filaments of O(100) m\nthickness as well as larger eddies, and develops turbulence that is spatially\nlocalized and organized. A O(100) m physical-space filter is applied to the\nsimulated flow to separate the coherent submesoscale from the finescale in a\ndecomposition that preserves their spatial organization unlike the typical\npractice of along-front averaging. Analysis of the submesoscale vertical\nvelocity (as large as 5 mm/s) reveals that downwelling is limited to the thin\nvortex filaments while upwelling occurs over spatially extensive regions in the\neddies, resulting in an overall buoyancy flux that is restratifying. The\nkinetic energy (KE) transport equations are evaluated separately at both the\nscales to understand energy pathways in this problem. The buoyancy flux\nassociated with coherent motions acts as the primary source of submesoscale KE\nwhich is then transported across the front with a fraction transferred to the\nfinescale. The transfer, limited to thin regions of O(100) m horizontal width,\nis accomplished by primarily horizontal strain in the upper 10 m and by\nvertical shear in the rest of the 50 m deep mixed layer. Frontogenetic\nmechanisms are diagnosed through analysis of the transport equation for squared\nbuoyancy gradient. Horizontal strain is the primary frontogenetic term and is\ncounteracted primarily by horizontal diffusion in the top 10 m and by the\nhorizontal gradient of vertical velocity further below.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 21:33:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-18"}

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel unsupervised domain adaptation framework, called Collaborative Feature\nEnsembling Adaptation (CFEA), to effectively overcome this challenge. Our\nproposed CFEA is an interactive paradigm which presents an exquisite of\ncollaborative adaptation through both adversarial learning and ensembling\nweights.

To fill this gap, we provide comprehensive solutions of the\nBoltzmann equation in the presence of an electric field and a temperature\ngradient for two different cases: First, when electron-electron collisions are\ntreated within the relaxation-time approximation while the full momentum\ndependence of electron-impurity scattering is included and, second, when the\nelectron-impurity scattering is momentum-independent, but the electron-electron\ncollisions give rise to a momentum-dependent inelastic scattering rate of the\nFermi-liquid type. We find that for Fermi-liquid as well as for Coulomb\ninteractions, both methods give the same results for the leading temperature\ndependence of the transport coefficients. Moreover, the inelastic relaxation\nrate enters the electric conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient only when the\nmomentum dependence of the electron-impurity collisions, analytical or\nnon-analytical, is included. Specifically, we show that inelastic processes\nonly mildly affect the electric conductivity, but can generate a non-monotonic\ndependence of the Seebeck coefficient on temperature and even a change of sign.\nThermal conductivity, by contrast, always depends on the inelastic scattering\nrate even for a constant elastic relaxation rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 22:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

For non-intrusive ROMs, we\nconsider two frameworks. The first is using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD),\nand the second is based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). For ANN, we\nutilized a residual deep neural network, and for DMD we have studied two\nversions of DMD approaches; one with hard thresholding and the other with\nsorted bases selection. Also, we highlight the differences between\nmean-subtracting the data (i.e., centering) and using the data without\nmean-subtraction. We tested these ROMs using a system of 2D shallow water\nequations for four different numerical experiments, adopting combinations of\nsampling rates and resolutions. For these cases, we found that the DMD basis\nobtained with hard threshodling is sensitive to sampling rate, performing worse\nat very high rates. The sorted DMD algorithm helps to mitigate this problem and\nyields more stabilized and converging solution. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat both DMD approaches with mean subtraction provide significantly more\naccurate results than DMD with mean-subtracting the data. On the other hand,\nPOD is relatively insensitive to sampling rate and yields better representation\nof the flow field. Meanwhile, resolution has little effect on both POD and DMD\nperformances. Therefore, we preferred to train the neural network in POD space,\nsince it is more stable and better represents our dataset. Numerical results\nreveal that an artificial neural network on POD subspace (POD-ANN) performs\nremarkably better than POD-GP and DMD in capturing system dynamics, even with a\nsmall number of modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 00:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Lithium abundances have\nbeen adjusted to the same scale for 103 stars in M 67 by Pace et al. The more\nmassive stars $-$ now the coolest and furthest-evolved from the main-sequence\n$-$ show a drop in Li by a factor of 400 across the subgiant branch.

The relative decline in Be abundance compared to\nLi is remarkably well fit by the models of Sills & Deliyannis, made\nspecifically for the subgiants in M 67.

In this work, we asked if it was\nphysically possible to prevent mTBI in American football with helmets alone.\nHere, we show that modern helmets of several types are unlikely to prevent mTBI\nfrom high speed collisions as might be seen in the NFL, but that introducing\nliquid as an energy absorbing medium can dramatically reduce the forces of\nimpact across a spectrum of impact severities. We hypothesized that a helmet\nwhich transmits a nearly constant force during football impacts is sufficient\nto reduce biomechanical loading in the brain below the threshold of mTBI. To\ntest this hypothesis, we first show that the optimal impact force transmitted\nto the head, in terms of brain strain, is in fact a constant force profile.\nThen, to generate a constant force with a helmet, we implement a computational\nmodel of a fluid-based shock absorber that adapts passively to any given impact\nspeed. Computer simulation of head impacts with liquid shock absorption\nindicate that, at the highest impact speed, the average brain tissue strain is\nreduced by 27.6% $\\pm$ 9.3 compared to existing helmet padding that is\navailable on the market. These simulations are based on the NFL's helmet test\nprotocol and predict that adding liquid shock absorbers could reduce the number\nof concussions by at least 75%. Taken together, these results suggest that the\nmajority of mTBI in football could be prevented with more efficient helmet\ntechnology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 05:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-18"}

The World Health Organization (WHO) Integrated Disease\nSurveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy seeks to drive the systematic\ncollection of surveillance data to strengthen district-level reporting and to\ntranslate them into public health actions. Since the analysis of this\nsurveillance data at the central levels of government in many developing\nnations has traditionally not included advanced analytics, there are\nopportunities for the development and exploration of computational approaches\nthat can provide proactive insights and improve general health outcomes of\ninfectious disease outbreaks. We propose and demonstrate a multivariate time\nseries cross-correlation analysis as a foundational step towards gaining\ninsight on infectious disease patterns via the pairwise computation of weighted\ncross-correlation scores for a specified disease across different health\ndistricts using surveillance data from Cameroon. Following the computation of\nweighted cross-correlation scores, we apply an anomaly detection algorithm to\nassess how outbreak alarm patterns align in highly correlated health districts.\nWe demonstrate how multivariate cross-correlation analysis of weekly\nsurveillance data can provide insight into infectious disease incidence\npatterns in Cameroon by identifying highly correlated health districts for a\ngiven disease. We further demonstrate scenarios in which identification of\nhighly correlated districts aligns with alarms flagged using a standard anomaly\ndetection algorithm, hinting at the potential of end to end solutions combining\nanomaly detection algorithms for flagging alarms in combination with\nmultivariate cross-correlation analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 07:13:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-18"}

The velocity $v$ of a\nparticle that is driven is modified to $-r_w v+\\eta$, where $r_w$ parameterises\nthe dissipation upon the driving and the noise $\\eta$ is taken from a fixed\ndistribution.

Nonetheless, owing to high intra- and inter-subject\nvariabilities, many studies on decoding EEG were designed in a subject-specific\nmanner by using calibration samples, with no concern of its practical use,\nhampered by time-consuming steps and a large data requirement. To this end,\nrecent studies adopted a transfer learning strategy, especially domain\nadaptation techniques. Among those, to our knowledge, an adversarial learning\nhas shown its potential in BCIs.

In this paper, we\nperform a combined theoretical and numerical study of triadic resonance in\ninternal wave modes in a finite-depth ocean with background rotation and an\narbitrary stratification profile. The spatial evolution of the modal amplitudes\nwithin a resonant triad are first derived based on the requirement that the\nnonlinear solution at leading order cannot diverge. The amplitude evolution\nequations are then numerically solved for two different cases: (i) modes 1 and\n2 at a specific frequency ({\\omega_0}) in triadic resonance with the mode-1\nsuperharmonic wave (2{\\omega_0}) in a uniform stratification, and (ii) a\nself-interacting mode-3 at a specific frequency {\\omega_0} in triadic resonance\nwith the mode-2 (2{\\omega_0}) in a nonuniform stratification representative of\nthe ocean. Quantitative estimates of energy transfer rates within the resonant\ntriad show that superharmonic wave generation resulting from modal interactions\nshould be an important consideration alongside other triadic resonances like\nparametric subharmonic instability (PSI). Remarkably, in case (ii), the\namplitude evolution equations suggest that any initial energy in mode-3 at\n{\\omega_0} would get permanently transferred to mode-2 at frequency\n2{\\omega_0}. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are then performed to show the\nspontaneous generation of superharmonic internal waves resulting from modal\ninteractions in the aforementioned two cases, and quantitatively validate the\ninitial spatial evolution of the wave field predicted by the amplitude\nevolution equations.

The scalability, as well as accuracy of the data structure\nis made possible by combining two novel ideas: The first idea introduces a new,\ncomputationally inexpensive way for populating bloom filters, making it\npossible to quickly compute new bloom filters when interacting with peers. The\nsecond idea introduces the concept of unique bloom filter mappings between\npeers. By applying these two simple ideas, one can achieve incredibly\nbandwidth-efficient set reconciliation in networks. Instead of trying to\nminimize the false positive rate of a single bloom filter, we use the unique\nbloom filter mappings to increase the probability for an element to propagate\nthrough a network. We compare the standard bloom filter with the distributed\nbloom filter and show that even with a false positive rate of 50%, i.e. even\nwith a very small bloom filter size, the distributed bloom filter still manages\nto reach complete set reconciliation across the network in a highly\nspace-efficient, as well as time-efficient way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 09:21:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 11:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}

The two parts are\nconnected into an end-to-end network with cascading style, which guarantees\nthat representations for item associations and sequential relationships are\nlearned simultaneously and make the learning process maintain low complexity.\nWe perform extensive experiments on three widely used real-world datasets:\nTaoBao, Amazon Instant Video and Amazon Cell Phone and Accessories.\nComprehensive results have shown that the proposed method outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis is also provided\nto encourage a better understanding about association relationships in\nsequential recommendation and illustrate the performance gain is exactly from\nitem association.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 09:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-18"}

The common explanation is the formation of heavily reduced,\nultrathin oxide films covering metal particles. This is typically encountered\nfor reducible oxides such as TiO2 or Fe3O4. Zirconia (ZrO2), a typical catalyst\nsupport, is difficult to reduce and therefore no obvious candidate for the SMSI\neffect. In this work, we use inverse model systems with Rh(111), Pt(111), and\nRu(0001) as supports. Contrary to expectations, we show that SMSI is\nencountered for zirconia. Upon annealing in ultra-high vacuum, oxygen-deficient\nultrathin zirconia films ($\\approx$ZrO$_{1.5}$) form on all three substrates.\nHowever, Zr remains in its preferred charge state of 4+, as electrons are\ntransferred to the underlying metal. At high temperatures, the stability of the\nultrathin zirconia films depends on whether alloying of Zr and the substrate\nmetal occurs. The SMSI effect is reversible; the ultrathin suboxide films can\nbe removed by annealing in oxygen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 09:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

Nonetheless, with the advent of Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\ninstruments characterized by a low sky background level and a high spatial\nresolution (most notably WFC3), slitless spectroscopy has become an adopted\nsurvey tool to study galaxy evolution from space. We investigate its\napplication to single object studies to measure not only redshift and\nintegrated spectral features, but also spatially resolved quantities such as\ngalaxy kinematics. We build a complete forward model to be quantitatively\ncompared to actual slitless observations. This model depends on a simplified\nthin cold disk galaxy description -- including flux distribution, intrinsic\nspectrum and kinematic parameters -- and on the instrumental signature. It is\nused to improve redshifts and constrain basic rotation curve parameters, i.e.\nplateau velocity $v_{0}$ (in $\\rm km.s^{-1}$) and central velocity gradient\n$w_{0}$ (in $\\rm km.s^{-1}.arcsec^{-1}$). The model is tested on selected\nobservations from 3D-HST and GLASS surveys, to estimate redshift and kinematic\nparameters on several galaxies measured with one or more roll angles. Our\nforward approach allows to mitigate the self-contamination effect, a primary\ndrawback of slitless spectroscopy, and therefore has the potential to increase\nprecision on redshifts. In a limited sample of well-resolved spiral galaxies\nfrom HST surveys, it is possible to significantly constrain galaxy rotation\ncurve parameters.

The transition paths connect two local\nfree energy minima and transition path times (TPT) are the actual durations of\nthe crossing events. The simplest model employed to analyze TPT and to fit\nempirical data is that of a stochastic particle crossing a parabolic barrier.\nMotivated by some disagreement between the value of the barrier height obtained\nfrom the TPT distributions as compared to the value obtained from kinetic and\nthermodynamic analyses, we investigate here TPT for barriers which deviate from\nthe symmetric parabolic shape.

Viscosity typically regularizes such singularities and leads to a\nshock structure. On the other hand, in 1d, singularities in the Hopf equation\ncan be non-dissipatively smoothed via KdV dispersion. Here, we develop a\nminimal conservative regularization of 3d ideal adiabatic flow of a gas with\npolytropic exponent $\\gamma$. It is achieved by augmenting the Hamiltonian by a\ncapillarity energy $\\beta(\\rho) (\\nabla \\rho)^2$. The simplest capillarity\ncoefficient leading to local conservation laws for mass, momentum, energy and\nentropy using the standard Poisson brackets is $\\beta(\\rho) = \\beta_*/\\rho$ for\nconstant $\\beta_*$. This leads to a Korteweg-like stress and nonlinear terms in\nthe momentum equation with third derivatives of $\\rho$, which are related to\nthe Bohm potential and Gross quantum pressure. Just like KdV, our equations\nadmit sound waves with a leading cubic dispersion relation, solitary and\nperiodic traveling waves. As with KdV, there are no steady continuous\nshock-like solutions satisfying the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. Nevertheless,\nin 1d, for $\\gamma = 2$, numerical solutions show that the gradient catastrophe\nis averted through the formation of pairs of solitary waves which can display\napproximate phase-shift scattering. Numerics also indicate recurrent behavior\nin periodic domains. These observations are related to an equivalence between\nour regularized equations (in the special case of constant specific entropy\npotential flow in any dimension) and the defocussing nonlinear Schrodinger\nequation (cubically nonlinear for $\\gamma = 2$), with $\\beta_*$ playing the\nrole of $\\hbar^2$. Thus, our regularization of gas dynamics may be viewed as a\ngeneralization of both the single field KdV & NLS equations to include the\nadiabatic dynamics of density, velocity, pressure & entropy in any dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 11:46:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2020 10:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-13"}

ALMA 3 mm and 1.3\nmm observations of five outflow sources at 130 -- 260 au resolution in the\nSerpens Main cloud are presented. Observations of CO, SiO, H$_2$CO and HCN\nreveal the kinematic and chemical structure of those flows. Three velocity\ncomponents are distinguished: the slow and the fast wing, and the EHV jet. Out\nof five sources, three have the EHV component. Comparison of outflow forces\nreveals that only the EHV jet in the youngest source Ser-emb 8 (N) has enough\nmomentum to power the slow outflow. The SiO abundance is generally enhanced\nwith velocity, while HCN is present in the slow and the fast wing, but\ndisappears in the EHV jet.

Under the hypothesis that black holes emit neutrino mass\neigenstates, we describe quantitatively how the PBH evolution and lifetime is\naffected by the mass and fermionic -- Dirac or Majorana -- nature of neutrinos.\nIn the case of Dirac neutrinos, PBHs radiate right-handed and left-handed\nneutrinos in equal amounts, thus possibly increasing the effective number of\nneutrino species, $N_{\\rm eff}$. Assuming an initially monochromatic PBH mass\nspectrum, with the initial mass $M_i$ related to the particle horizon mass, and\nconsidering the current constraint on $N_{\\rm eff}$, we derive a bound on the\ninitial PBH fraction $\\beta^\\prime$ in the interval $4.3\\times 10^7\\ {\\rm\ng}\\lesssim M_i \\lesssim 10^9$ g. Future measurements of $N_{\\rm eff}$ may be\nable to constraint the initial fraction for black hole masses as low as 1 g. If\nan excess in $N_{\\rm eff}$ is found, PBHs with Dirac neutrinos could provide a\nminimal explanation of it. For example, for $10^7\\ {\\rm g} \\lesssim M_i\\lesssim\n10^9$ g and $\\beta^\\prime \\gtrsim 10^{-13}$, an excess radiation at the level\nof $0.2\\lesssim \\Delta N_{\\rm eff}\\lesssim 0.37$ is produced, which can\nalleviate the tension of the Hubble parameter measurements. Finally, we obtain\nthe diffuse flux of right-helical neutrinos from PBHs at the Earth, and show\nthat their detection in a PTOLEMY-like detector (using neutrino capture on\ntritium) would be difficult.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 12:47:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 15:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-07"}

PKS 1549-79 is one of the closest young, radio-loud quasars caught in an\non-going merger in which the AGN is in the first phases of its evolution. We\ndetect three structures tracing the accretion and the outflow of molecular gas:\nkpc-scale tails of gas accreting onto PKS 1549-79, a circumnuclear disc (CND)\nin the inner few hundred parsec, and a very broad (>2300 \\kms) component\ndetected in CO(1-0) at the position of the AGN. Thus, in PKS 1549-79 we see the\nco-existence of accretion and the ejection of gas. The line ratio\nCO(1-0)/CO(3-2) suggests that the gas in the CND has both high densities and\nhigh kinetic temperatures. We estimate a mass outflow rate of at least 650\nmsun/yr. This massive outflow is confined to r < 120 pc, which suggests that\nthe AGN drives the outflow. Considering the amount of molecular gas available\nin CND and the observed outflow rate, we estimate a time scale of ~10^5 yr over\nwhich the AGN would be able to destroy the CND, although gas from the merger\nmay come in from larger radii, rebuilding this disc at the same time. The AGN\nappears to self-regulate gas accretion onto the super-massive black hole. From\na comparison with HST data, we find that the ionised gas outflow is more\nextended. Nevertheless, the warm outflow is about two orders of magnitude less\nmassive than the molecular outflow. PKS 1549-79 does not seem to follow the\nscaling relation between bolometric luminosity and the relative importance of\nwarm ionised and molecular outflows claimed to exist for other AGN. We argue\nthat, although PKS 1549-79 hosts a powerful quasar nucleus and an ultra-fast\noutflow, the radio jet plays a significant role in producing the outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 12:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

In this paper, we\npropose a novel method that combines a Weighted Oversampling Technique and\nensemble Boosting method (WOTBoost) to improve the classification accuracy of\nminority data without sacrificing the accuracy of the majority class. WOTBoost\nadjusts its oversampling strategy at each round of boosting to synthesize more\ntargeted minority data samples. The adjustment is enforced using a weighted\ndistribution. We compare WOTBoost with other four classification models (i.e.,\ndecision tree, SMOTE + decision tree, ADASYN + decision tree, SMOTEBoost)\nextensively on 18 public accessible imbalanced datasets. WOTBoost achieves the\nbest G mean on 6 datasets and highest AUC score on 7 datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 13:27:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 20:10:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 19:36:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-14"}

In particular, interpretations in general provenance semirings of\npolynomials or formal power series give precise descriptions of the successful\nevaluation strategies for the query. While provenance analysis in databases\nhas, for a long time, been largely confined to negation-free query languages, a\nrecent approach extends this to model checking problems for logics with full\nnegation. Algebraically this relies on new quotient semirings of\ndual-indeterminate polynomials or power series. So far, this approach has been\ndeveloped mainly for first-order logic and for the positive fragment of least\nfixed-point logic. What has remained open is an adequate treatment for\nfixed-point calculi that admit arbitrary interleavings of least and greatest\nfixed points. We show that an adequate framework for the provenance analysis of\nfull fixed-point logics is provided by semirings that are (1) fully continuous,\n(2) absorptive, and (3) chain-positive. Full continuity guarantees that\nprovenance values of least and greatest fixed-points are well-defined.\nAbsorptive semirings provide a symmetry between least and greatest fixed-point\ncomputations and make sure that provenance values of greatest fixed points are\ninformative. Finally, chain-positivity is responsible for having\ntruth-preserving interpretations, which give non-zero values to all true\nformulae. We further identify semirings of generalized absorptive polynomials\nand prove universal properties that make them the most general appropriate\nsemirings for LFP.

Such refocusing mechanisms can increase the\ncost, complexity and weight of imaging systems. Here, we show that by judicious\ndesign of a multi-level diffractive lens (MDL) it is possible to drastically\nenhance the depth of focus, by over 4 orders of magnitude. Using such a lens,\nwe are able to maintain focus for objects that are separated by as large as ~6m\nin our experiments. Specifically, when illuminated by collimated light at\nlambda=0.85mm, the MDL produced a beam that remained in focus from 5mm to\n~1500mm from the MDL. The measured full-width at half-maximum of the focused\nbeam varied from 6.6um (5mm away from MDL) to 524um (1500mm away from MDL).\nSince the sidelobes were well suppressed and the main-lobe was close to the\ndiffraction-limit, imaging with a horizontal X vertical field of view of 20deg\nx 15deg over the entire focal range was demonstrated. This demonstration opens\nup a new direction for lens design, where by treating the phase in the focal\nplane as a free parameter, extreme depth-of-focus imaging becomes possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 16:27:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-18"}

However, this is generally not the case for natural waves within\nunsteady wave groups. This motivates our study, which presents new insights\ninto the generic behavior of crest speeds of linear to highly nonlinear\nunsteady waves. While our major focus is on gravity waves where a generic crest\nslowdown occurs cyclically, results for capillary-dominated waves are also\ndiscussed, for which crests cyclically speed up. This curious phenomenon arises\nwhen the theoretical constraint of steadiness is relaxed, allowing waves to\nchange their form, or shape. In particular, a kinematic analysis of both\nsimulated and observed open ocean gravity waves reveals a forward-to-backward\nleaning cycle for each individual crest within a wave group. This is clearly\nmanifest during the focusing of dominant wave groups essentially due to the\ndispersive nature of waves.

Theoretical calculations of band structure are realized with\nfull-potential local-orbital minimum-basis code using scalar relativistic and\nfull relativistic approach. The calculations reveal a depletion of density of\nstates at the Fermi level for CeRhSb. This gap is shifted above the Fermi\nenergy with increasing Sn content and thus a rise of density of states at the\nFermi level is reflected in the calculations. It agrees with metallic\nproperties of compounds with larger $x$. The calculations also yield another\nimportant effects of Sn substitution. Band structure is displaced in a\ndirection corresponding to hole doping, although with deviations from a rigid\nband shift scenario. Lifshitz transitions modify a topology of the Fermi\nsurface a few times and a number of bands crossing the Fermi level increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 15:23:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-13"}

A natural problem is trying to further generalize the result\nto cyclic polygons with a larger number of edges, which, surprisingly, has\nrevealed to be far from simple. In this paper we investigate such a problem by\nfollowing a new and elementary approach. We start from the simple observation\nthat the incircle of a right triangle touches its hypothenuse in a point that\nsplits it into two segments, the product of whose lengths equals the area of\nthe triangle. From this curious fact we derive in a few lines: an unusual proof\nof the Pythagoras' theorem, Heron's theorem for right triangles, Heron's\ntheorem for general triangles, and Brahmagupta's theorem for cyclic\nquadrangles. This suggests that cutting the edges of a cyclic polygon by means\nof suitable points should be the \"right\" working method. Indeed, following this\nidea, we obtain an explicit formula for the area of any convex cyclic polygon,\nas a symmetric function of the segments split on its edges by the incircles of\na triangulation.

As one crucial application of AI, dialogue\nsystems have been extensively applied in our society.

In particular, we\nconstruct a benchmark dataset and propose quantitative measures to understand\nfairness in dialogue models. Our studies demonstrate that popular dialogue\nmodels show significant prejudice towards different genders and races. Besides,\nto mitigate the bias in dialogue systems, we propose two simple but effective\ndebiasing methods. Experiments show that our methods can reduce the bias in\ndialogue systems significantly.

Then, we design an optimized pipeline\narchitecture on FPGA that has efficient random access into the sparse kernels\nand exploits various dimensions of parallelism in convolutional layers.\nOverall, SPEC2 achieves high inference throughput with extremely low\ncomputation complexity and negligible accuracy degradation. We demonstrate\nSPEC2 by pruning and implementing LeNet and VGG16 on the Xilinx Virtex\nplatform. After pruning 75% of the spectral weights, SPEC2 achieves 0% accuracy\nloss for LeNet, and <1% accuracy loss for VGG16.

However, the input statistics for such\nratings are subject to randomness and factors outside the quarterback's\ncontrol. To investigate this variance, we perform a sensitivity analysis of\nthree quarterback rating statistics: the Traditional 1971 rating by Smith, the\nBurke, and the Wages of Wins ratings. The comparisons are made at the team\nlevel for the 32 NFL teams from 2002-2015, thus giving each case an even 16\ngames. We compute quarterback ratings for each offense with 1-5 additional\ntouchdowns, 1-5 fewer interceptions, 1-5 additional sacks, and a 1-5 percent\nincrease in the passing completion rate. Our sensitivity analysis provides\ninsight into whether an elite passing team could seem mediocre or vice versa\nbased on random outcomes. The results indicate that the Traditional rating is\nthe most sensitive statistic with respect to touchdowns, interceptions, and\ncompletions, whereas the Burke rating is most sensitive to sacks. The analysis\nsuggests that team passing offense rankings are highly sensitive to aspects of\nfootball that are out of the quarterback's hands (e.g., deflected passes that\nlead to interceptions). Thus, on the margins, we show arguments about whether a\nspecific quarterback has entered the elite or remains mediocre are irrelevant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 18:19:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}
