Methods for utilizing unlabeled data\ncan have a huge potential to further accelerate robotic learning. We consider\nhere the problem of performing manipulation tasks from pixels. In such tasks,\nchoosing an appropriate state representation is crucial for planning and\ncontrol. This is even more relevant with real images where noise, occlusions\nand resolution affect the accuracy and reliability of state estimation. In this\nwork, we learn a latent state representation implicitly with deep reinforcement\nlearning in simulation, and then adapt it to the real domain using unlabeled\nreal robot data. We propose to do so by optimizing sequence-based self\nsupervised objectives. These exploit the temporal nature of robot experience,\nand can be common in both the simulated and real domains, without assuming any\nalignment of underlying states in simulated and unlabeled real images. We\npropose Contrastive Forward Dynamics loss, which combines dynamics model\nlearning with time-contrastive techniques. The learned state representation\nthat results from our methods can be used to robustly solve a manipulation task\nin simulation and to successfully transfer the learned skill on a real system.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches by training a vision-based\nreinforcement learning agent for cube stacking. Agents trained with our method,\nusing only 5 hours of unlabeled real robot data for adaptation, shows a clear\nimprovement over domain randomization, and standard visual domain adaptation\ntechniques for sim-to-real transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 16:00:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

Hence, PO is by nature a constrained (nonconvex) optimization in\nmost cases, whose global convergence is challenging to analyze in general. More\nimportantly, some constraints that are safety-critical, e.g., the\n$\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$-norm constraint that guarantees the system robustness, are\ndifficult to enforce as the PO methods proceed. Recently, policy gradient\nmethods have been shown to converge to the global optimum of linear quadratic\nregulator (LQR), a classical optimal control problem, without\nregularizing/projecting the control iterates onto the stabilizing set, its\n(implicit) feasible set. This striking result is built upon the coercive\nproperty of the cost, ensuring that the iterates remain feasible as the cost\ndecreases. In this paper, we study the convergence theory of PO for\n$\\mathcal{H}_2$ linear control with $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$-norm robustness\nguarantee. One significant new feature of this problem is the lack of\ncoercivity, i.e., the cost may have finite value around the feasible set\nboundary, breaking the existing analysis for LQR.

However, existing weak supervision approaches\nfail to model multi-resolution sources for sequential data, like video, that\ncan assign labels to individual elements or collections of elements in a\nsequence. A key challenge in weak supervision is estimating the unknown\naccuracies and correlations of these sources without using labeled data.\nMulti-resolution sources exacerbate this challenge due to complex correlations\nand sample complexity that scales in the length of the sequence. We propose\nDugong, the first framework to model multi-resolution weak supervision sources\nwith complex correlations to assign probabilistic labels to training data.\nTheoretically, we prove that Dugong, under mild conditions, can uniquely\nrecover the unobserved accuracy and correlation parameters and use parameter\nsharing to improve sample complexity.

The pore width is chosen such that\nconfigurations consisting of two consecutive big squares, or three small\nsquares, in the transverse direction, perpendicular to the walls, are\nforbidden. We analyzed two different mixtures with edge-lengths of species\nselected so as to allow or forbid one big plus one small square to fit into the\nchannel. For the first mixture we obtained first-order transitions between\nsymmetric and asymmetric packings of particles: small and big squares are\npreferentially adsorbed at different walls. Asymmetric configurations are shown\nto lead to more efficient packing at finite pressures. We argue that the\nstability region of the asymmetric phase in the pressure-composition plane is\nbounded so that the symmetric phase is stable at low and very high pressure.\nFor the second mixture, we observe strong demixing between phases which are\nrich in different species. Demixing occurs in the transverse direction, i.e.\nthe dividing interface is perpendicular to the walls, and phases exhibit\nsymmetric density profiles. The possible experimental realization of this\nbehaviour (which in practical terms is precluded by jamming) in strictly\ntwo-dimensional systems is discussed. Finally the phase behavior of a mixture\nwith periodic boundary conditions is analyzed and the differences and\nsimilarities between the latter and the confined system are discussed.

One obvious possibility is for each\nagent to broadcast their current intention, for example, the currently executed\noption in a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. However, this\napproach results in inflexibility of agents if options have an extended\nduration and are dynamic. While adjusting the executed option at each step\nimproves flexibility from a single-agent perspective, frequent changes in\noptions can induce inconsistency between an agent's actual behaviour and its\nbroadcast intention. In order to balance flexibility and predictability, we\npropose a dynamic termination Bellman equation that allows the agents to\nflexibly terminate their options.

The host-plants on which these insects feed and often spend parts of\ntheir life cycle constitute ideal agents of divergent selection for these\norganisms. Adaptation to feeding on different host-plant species can\npotentially lead to ecological specialization of populations and subsequent\nspeciation. This process is thought to have given birth to the astonishing\ndiversity of phytophagous insects and is often put forward in macroevolutionary\nscenarios of insect diversification. Consequently, numerous phylogenetic\nstudies on phytophagous insects have aimed at testing whether speciation driven\nby host-plant adaptation is the main pathway for the diversification of the\ngroups under investigation.

In\nsome applications, a set of analog signals are acquired individually and\nprocessed jointly. Such setups are referred to as distributed quantization. In\nthis work, we propose a distributed quantization scheme for representing a set\nof sparse time sequences acquired using conventional scalar ADCs. Our approach\nutilizes tools from secure group testing theory to exploit the sparse nature of\nthe acquired analog signals, obtaining a compact and accurate representation\nwhile operating in a distributed fashion. We then show how our technique can be\nimplemented when the quantized signals are transmitted over a multi-hop\ncommunication network providing a low-complexity network policy for routing and\nsignal recovery. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed scheme\nnotably outperforms conventional methods based on the combination of\nquantization and compressed sensing tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 17:20:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

Propagating waves and instabilities in hot\nJupiter atmospheres can cause emergent properties of the atmosphere to be\ntime-variable. In this work, we study such weather in hot Jupiter atmospheres\nusing idealized cloud-free general circulation models with double-grey\nradiative transfer. We find that hot Jupiter atmospheres can be time-variable\nat the $\\sim 0.1-1\\%$ level in globally averaged temperature and at the $\\sim\n1-10\\%$ level in globally averaged wind speeds. As a result, we find that\nobservable quantities are also time variable: the secondary eclipse depth can\nbe variable at the $\\lesssim 2\\%$ level, the phase curve amplitude can change\nby $\\lesssim 1\\%$, the phase curve offset can shift by $\\lesssim 5^{\\circ}$,\nand terminator-averaged wind speeds can vary by $\\lesssim 2~\n\\mathrm{km}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Additionally, we calculate how the eastern and\nwestern limb-averaged wind speeds vary with incident stellar flux and the\nstrength of an imposed drag that parameterizes Lorentz forces in partially\nionized atmospheres. We find that the eastern limb is blueshifted in models\nover a wide range of equilibrium temperature and drag strength, while the\nwestern limb is only redshifted if equilibrium temperatures are\n$\\lesssim1500~\\mathrm{K}$ and drag is weak.

For each of these triggers, we compute evidence for\nastrophysical origin from the rest of the detector network by coherently\ncombining the likelihoods from all detectors and marginalizing over extrinsic\ngeometric parameters.

Among the forty selected\neconomical models, the majority of the models proposed in this work are new. In\nour search, we also include the scenarios where the particles in the loop carry\ncharges under the color group. Furthermore, we discuss the possible dark matter\ncandidates within a given model, if any, without extending the minimal particle\ncontent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 17:59:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2020 23:40:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2020 18:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

This effect naturally results from the\nshape and scatter of the stellar-to-halo mass relation and the galaxy formation\nhistories.

The line graph has a GFT that is\na direct analogue to the Discrete Cosine Transform Type II (DCT-II). Leveraging\nFourier transform properties, one can then define processing operations on this\ngraph structure that is loosely analogous to processing operations encountered\nin Digital Signal Processing (DSP) theory. This raises the question of whether\nwell defined DSP-like operations can be derived from the GFT for more complex\ngraph structures. One potential approach to this problem is to perturb simple\ngraph structures and study the perturbation's impact on the graph Laplacian.\nThis paper explores this idea by examining the eigenvalue decomposition of the\nLaplacian of undirected line graphs that undergo a single edge weight\nperturbation. This single perturbation can perturb either an existing edge\nweight or create new edge between distant unconnected vertices. The eigenvalue\nbounds are expressed in closed form and agree with simulated examples.

We find that storm-time orbital decay along the satellites' path\ngenerally increases with storm intensity, being stronger and faster for the\nmost extreme events.

At all wavelengths, the total and polarized emission is concentrated\nin a ring-like structure between about 7 kpc and 13 kpc radius from the center.\nPropagation of cosmic rays away from star-forming regions is evident. The ring\nof synchrotron emission is wider than the ring of the thermal radio emission,\nand the radial scale length of synchrotron emission is larger than that of\nthermal emission. The polarized intensity from the ring varies\ndouble-periodically with azimuthal angle, indicating that the ordered magnetic\nfield is almost oriented along the ring, with a pitch angle of -14{\\deg} $\\pm$\n2{\\deg}. Faraday rotation measures (RM) show a large-scale sinusoidal variation\nwith azimuthal angle, signature of an axisymmetric spiral (ASS) regular\nmagnetic field, plus a superimposed double-periodic variation of a bisymmetric\nspiral (BSS) field with about 6x smaller amplitude. The dominating ASS field of\nM 31 is the most compelling case so far of a field generated by the action of a\nmean-field dynamo. The RM amplitude between 6.2 cm and 3.6 cm is about 50%\nlarger than between 11.3 cm and 6.2 cm, indicating that Faraday depolarization\nat 11.3 cm is stronger than at 6.2 cm and 3.6 cm. The phase of the sinusoidal\nRM variation of -7{\\deg} $\\pm$ 1{\\deg} is interpreted as the average spiral\npitch angle of the regular field. The average pitch angle of the ordered field,\nas derived from the intrinsic orientation of the polarized emission (corrected\nfor Faraday rotation), is significantly smaller: -26{\\deg} $\\pm$ 3{\\deg}. The\ndifference in pitch angle of the regular and the ordered fields indicates that\nthe ordered field contains a significant fraction of an anisotropic turbulent\nfield that has a different pattern than the regular (ASS + BSS) field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 20:15:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 17:39:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-25"}

The OPF problem is non-convex due to the\nsinusoidal nature of electrical generation and thus is difficult to solve.\nUsing small angle approximations leads to a convex problem known as DC OPF, but\nthis approximation is no longer valid when power grids are heavily loaded.

Although one could project\nthe output of a network into a physically feasible region, such a postprocess\nis not captured by the energy function minimized when training the network;\nthus, the final projected result could incorrectly deviate quite far from the\ntraining data. We propose folding any such projection or postprocess directly\ninto the network so that the final result is correctly compared to the training\ndata by the energy function. Although we propose a general approach, we\nillustrate its efficacy on a specific convolutional neural network that takes\nin human pose parameters (joint rotations) and outputs a prediction of vertex\npositions representing a triangulated cloth mesh. While the original network\noutputs vertex positions with erroneously high stretching and compression\nenergies, the new network trained with our physics prior remedies these issues\nproducing highly improved results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 21:58:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2019 00:04:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

Three- and four-dimensional harmonic\noscillator wavefunctions are reorganized by the SU(2) Aharanov-Casher gauge\npotential to yield high-dimensional Landau levels possessing the full\nrotational symmetries and flat energy dispersions.

In this article, we present an upgrade of the\npseudospectral SGRID code, which enables us to access even larger regions of\nthe binary neutron star parameter space. As a proof of principle, we present a\nselected set of first simulations based on initial configurations computed with\nthe new code version. In particular, we simulate two millisecond pulsars close\nto their breakup spin, highly compact neutron stars with masses at about $98\\%$\nof the maximum supported mass of the employed equation of state, and an unequal\nmass systems with mass ratios even outside the range predicted by population\nsynthesis models ($q = 2.03$). The discussed code extension will help us to\nsimulate previously unexplored binary configurations. This is a necessary step\nto construct and test new gravitational wave approximants and to interpret\nupcoming binary neutron star merger observations. When we construct initial\ndata, one has to specify various parameters, such as a rotation parameter for\neach star.

The governing equations\nof two-phase flow and heat transfer were numerically solved using the Volume of\nFluid-Continuum Surface Force (VOF-CSF) method in a two-dimensional\naxisymmetric computational domain.

Simulation results show that a counter flow of the bulk liquid inside and\noutside the porous tube creates internal liquid circulations in both the axial\nand radial directions, resulting in an increased liquid velocity near the tube\nwall, thus an enhanced convective heat transfer. It is also found that there\nexists an optimum diameter of the porous-tube-insert (or annular gap dimension\nbetween the tube wall and porous tube) for convective heat transfer\nenhancement.

When this happens, an IACT that is able to resolve the air shower\nboth in time and angle should be able to document an unusual optical effect\nknown as relativistic image doubling (RID). The logic of RID is that the shower\nappears to precede its own Cherenkov radiation when its speed component toward\nthe IACT is superluminal, but appears to trail its own Cherenkov radiation when\nits speed component toward the IACT is subluminal. The result is that the IACT\nwill see the shower start not at the top of the atmosphere but in the middle --\nat the point along the shower's path where its radial velocity component drops\nto subluminal. Images of the shower would then be seen by the IACT to go both\nup and down simultaneously. A simple simulation demonstrating this effect is\npresented.

Consequently, critical\ninformation is often lost due to resource limitations, and critical\nconservation questions may be answered too slowly to support decision-making.\nComputer vision is poised to dramatically increase efficiency in image-based\nbiodiversity surveys, and recent studies have harnessed deep learning\ntechniques for automatic information extraction from camera trap images.\nHowever, the accuracy of results depends on the amount, quality, and diversity\nof the data available to train models, and the literature has focused on\nprojects with millions of relevant, labeled training images.

In this paper, we describe another\nphenomenon, called vanishing nodes, that also increases the difficulty of\ntraining deep neural networks. As the depth of a neural network increases, the\nnetwork's hidden nodes have more highly correlated behavior. This results in\ngreat similarities between these nodes. The redundancy of hidden nodes thus\nincreases as the network becomes deeper. We call this problem vanishing nodes,\nand we propose the metric vanishing node indicator (VNI) for quantitatively\nmeasuring the degree of vanishing nodes. The VNI can be characterized by the\nnetwork parameters, which is shown analytically to be proportional to the depth\nof the network and inversely proportional to the network width. The theoretical\nresults show that the effective number of nodes vanishes to one when the VNI\nincreases to one (its maximal value), and that vanishing/exploding gradients\nand vanishing nodes are two different challenges that increase the difficulty\nof training deep neural networks. The numerical results from the experiments\nsuggest that the degree of vanishing nodes will become more evident during\nback-propagation training, and that when the VNI is equal to 1, the network\ncannot learn simple tasks (e.g. the XOR problem) even when the gradients are\nneither vanishing nor exploding. We refer to this kind of gradients as the\nwalking dead gradients, which cannot help the network converge when having a\nrelatively large enough scale.

We think that this is incomplete for the security of covert\ncommunication. In this paper, we propose a new covert communication framework,\nwhich considers both content security and behavioral security in the process of\ninformation transmission. In the experimental part, we analyzed a large amount\nof collected real Twitter data to illustrate the security risks that may be\nbrought to covert communication if we only consider content security and\nneglect behavioral security. Finally, we designed a toy experiment, pointing\nout that in addition to most of the existing content steganography, under the\nproposed new framework of covert communication, we can also use user's behavior\nto implement behavioral steganography. We hope this new proposed framework will\nhelp researchers to design better covert communication systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 04:19:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 06:46:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

In contrast to deterministic networks,\nwhich represent mappings from a set of inputs to a set of outputs, stochastic\nnetworks represent mappings from a set of inputs to a set of probability\ndistributions over the set of outputs. In particular, even if the sets of\ninputs and outputs are finite, the class of stochastic mappings in question is\nnot finite. Moreover, while for a deterministic function the values of all\noutput variables can be computed independently of each other given the values\nof the inputs, in the stochastic setting the values of the output variables may\nneed to be correlated, which requires that their values are computed jointly. A\nprominent class of stochastic feedforward networks which has played a key role\nin the resurgence of deep learning are deep belief networks.

A desirable feature of a conformance checking technique is\nto identify a minimal yet complete set of differences. Existing conformance\nchecking techniques that fulfil this property exhibit limited scalability when\nconfronted to large and complex models and logs. This paper presents two\ncomplementary techniques to address these shortcomings. The first technique\ntransforms the model and log into two automata. These automata are compared\nusing an error-correcting synchronized product, computed via an A* that\nguarantees the resulting automaton captures all differences with a minimal\namount of error corrections. The synchronized product is used to extract\nminimal-length alignments between each trace of the log and the closest\ncorresponding trace of the model. A limitation of the first technique is that\nas the level of concurrency in the model increases, the size of the automaton\nof the model grows exponentially, thus hampering scalability. To address this\nlimitation, the paper proposes a second technique wherein the process model is\nfirst decomposed into a set of automata, known as S-components, such that the\nproduct of these automata is equal to the automaton of the whole process model.\nAn error-correcting product is computed for each S-component separately and the\nresulting automata are recomposed into a single product automaton capturing all\ndifferences without minimality guarantees. An empirical evaluation shows that\nthe proposed techniques outperform state-of-the-art baselines in terms of\ncomputational efficiency.

The ambiguous boundary between\ndifferent semantic parts and those categories with similar appearance usually\nare confusing, leading to unexpected noises in ground truth masks. To tackle\nthe problem of learning with label noises, this work introduces a purification\nstrategy, called Self-Correction for Human Parsing (SCHP), to progressively\npromote the reliability of the supervised labels as well as the learned models.\nIn particular, starting from a model trained with inaccurate annotations as\ninitialization, we design a cyclically learning scheduler to infer more\nreliable pseudo-masks by iteratively aggregating the current learned model with\nthe former optimal one in an online manner. Besides, those correspondingly\ncorrected labels can in turn to further boost the model performance. In this\nway, the models and the labels will reciprocally become more robust and\naccurate during the self-correction learning cycles. Benefiting from the\nsuperiority of SCHP, we achieve the best performance on two popular\nsingle-person human parsing benchmarks, including LIP and Pascal-Person-Part\ndatasets.

So far only ground based\nobservations, which rely on sophisticated models describing high energy\ninteractions in the earth's atmosphere, have been possible due to the extremely\nlow particle rates at these energies. A calorimetry based space experiment that\ncould provide not only flux measurements but also energy spectra and particle\nidentification, would certainly overcome some of the uncertainties of ground\nbased experiments.

Firstly, mapping cyberspace in geographic\nspace only reveals a partial characteristics of cyberspace, especially\ngeographic characteristic of cyberspace.

Our formulated lifetime\nmaximization problem captures the energy expenditure due to message\ntransmissions/ receptions in terms of the number of data packets transmitted/\nreceived, in contrast to prior works, which consider the number of data units\n(amount of sensor data generated by a node) transmitted/ received. Variable\ntransmission power levels of the radio and accounting for the sensor energy\nconsumption are other factors that make our problem formulation different from\nthose in prior work. We prove that this problem is NP-complete and propose an\nalgorithm to solve it. The performance of the proposed algorithm is\nexperimentally evaluated using Jain's fairness index as a metric by\nimplementing it on an actual testbed consisting of 20 sensor nodes and compared\nwith those of the widely used shortest path tree (SPT) and random data\ncollection tree (RDCT) algorithms. The energy consumption of different nodes\nunder the proposed algorithm are shown to be more balanced than under SPT and\nRDCT algorithms. Also, the performance of the proposed algorithm in large\nnetworks is studied through simulations and is compared with those of the\nstate-of-the-art RaSMaLai algorithm, SPT, minimum spanning tree, and RDCT based\ndata collection schemes. Our simulations show that the proposed algorithm\nprovides a significantly higher network lifetime compared to all the other\nconsidered data collection approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 06:59:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 03:44:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

The observations reveal a complex extended structure that is\ncomposed of at least two components: a non-uniform wide cavity whose walls are\ndetected in continuum emission up to 400~au, and a collimated wiggling-jet\ndetected in the emission lines of Helium and Hydrogen. Moreover, the presence\nof [FeII] emission projected close to the cavity walls suggests the presence of\na slower moving wind, most likely a disk wind. The multiple components of the\noptical forbidden lines also indicate the presence of a high-velocity jet\nco-existing with a slow wind. We constructed a geometrical model of the\ncollimated jet flowing within the cavity using intensity and velocity maps,\nfinding that its wiggling is consistent with the orbital period of the central\nbinary. The cavity and the jet do not share the same position angle, suggesting\nthat the jet is itself experiencing a precession motion possibly due to the\nwide M-dwarf companion. We propose a scenario that closely agrees with the\ngeneral expectation of a magneto-centrifugal-launched jet. These results build\nupon the extensive studies already conducted on RCrA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 07:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Previous techniques have treated each abundance\ndimension as being statistically independent, despite theoretical expectations\nthat many elements can be produced by more than one nucleosynthetic process. In\nthis work we introduce a data-driven model of nucleosynthesis where a set of\nlatent factors (e.g., nucleosynthetic yields) contribute to all stars with\ndifferent scores, and clustering (e.g., chemical tagging) is modelled by a\nmixture of multivariate Gaussians in a lower-dimensional latent space. We use\nan exact method to simultaneously estimate the factor scores for each star, the\npartial assignment of each star to each cluster, and the latent factors common\nto all stars, even in the presence of missing data entries. We use an\ninformation-theoretic Bayesian principle to estimate the number of latent\nfactors and clusters. Using the second Galah data release we find that six\nlatent factors are preferred to explain N = 2,566 stars with 17 chemical\nabundances. We identify the rapid- and slow-neutron capture processes, as well\nas latent factors consistent with Fe-peak and \\alpha-element production, and\nanother where K and Zn dominate.

We argue that more data, and joint\npriors on cluster membership that are constrained by dynamical models, are\nnecessary to realise chemical tagging at a galactic-scale. We release software\nthat allows for model parameters to be optimised in seconds given a fixed\nnumber of latent factors, components, and $10^7$ abundance measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 08:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

The reinsurer, as the leader of the Stackelberg game, can price\nreinsurance premium and invest its wealth in a financial market that contains a\nrisk-free asset and a risky asset. The two insurers, as the followers of the\nStackelberg game, can purchase proportional reinsurance from the reinsurer and\ninvest in the same financial market. The competitive relationship between two\ninsurers is modeled by the non-zero-sum game, and their decision making will\nconsider the relative performance measured by the difference in their terminal\nwealth. We consider wealth processes with delay to characterize the bounded\nmemory feature. This paper aims to find the equilibrium strategy for the\nreinsurer and insurers by maximizing the expected utility of the reinsurer's\nterminal wealth with delay and maximizing the expected utility of the\ncombination of insurers' terminal wealth and the relative performance with\ndelay.

These neutral gas\nreservoirs can, however, be illuminated by bright cosmic lightsources such as\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and quasars. The aim of this thesis is to use these\nluminous objects as tools to study the environments of intervening or host\ngalaxy absorption systems through cosmic time. Part I is dedicated to examining\nthe gas, dust and metals in the immediate region surrounding GRBs. Part II\npresents a search for and the study of cold and molecular gas in high-z GRB\nhost galaxy absorption systems. Part III focuses on using quasars to examine\ngas-rich intervening galaxies in the line of sight, with specific focus on\nabsorption systems rich in dust and metals.

The properties we consider in\ncombination are an interaction between the dark matter and dark energy\ncomponents, and a dark energy equation of state $w$ different from that of the\ncanonical cosmological constant $w=-1$. In principle, these two parameters are\nindependent. In practice, to avoid early-time, superhorizon instabilities,\ntheir allowed parameter spaces are correlated. We analyze three classes of\nextended interacting dark energy models in light of the 2019 Planck CMB results\nand Cepheid-calibrated local distance ladder $H_0$ measurements of Riess et al.\n(R19), as well as recent BAO and SNeIa distance data. We find that in\nquintessence coupled dark energy models, where $w > -1$, the evidence for a\nnon-zero coupling between the two dark sectors can surpass the $5\\sigma$\nsignificance. On the other hand, in phantom coupled dark energy models, there\nis no such preference for a non-zero dark sector coupling. All the models we\nconsider significantly raise the value of the Hubble constant easing the $H_0$\ntension. The addition of low-redshift BAO and SNeIa measurements leaves some\nresidual tension with R19 but at a level that could be justified by a\nstatistical fluctuation. Bayesian evidence considerations mildly disfavour both\nthe coupled quintessence and phantom models, while mildly favouring a coupled\nvacuum scenario, even when late-time datasets are considered. We conclude that\nnon-minimal dark energy cosmologies, such as coupled quintessence, phantom, or\nvacuum models, are still an interesting route towards softening existing\ncosmological tensions, even when low-redshift datasets and Bayesian evidence\nconsiderations are taken into account.

In the past two\ndecades, an emphasis has been placed on the turbulent transport induced by the\nvertical shear instability. However, instabilities arising from horizontal\nshear and the strength of the anisotropic turbulent transport that they may\ntrigger remain relatively unexplored. This paper investigates the combined\neffects of stable stratification, rotation, and thermal diffusion on the\nhorizontal shear instabilities in the context of stellar radiative zones. The\neigenvalue problem describing linear instabilities of a flow with a\nhyperbolic-tangent horizontal shear profile was solved numerically for a wide\nrange of parameters. As a first step, we consider a polar $f$-plane where the\ngravity and rotation vector are aligned. Two types of instabilities are\nidentified: the inflectional and inertial instabilities. The inflectional\ninstability that arises from the inflection point is the most unstable when at\na zero vertical wavenumber and a finite wavenumber in the streamwise direction\nalong the imposed-flow direction. The three-dimensional inflectional\ninstability is destabilized by stratification, while it is stabilized by\nthermal diffusion. The inertial instability is rotationally driven, and a WKBJ\nanalysis reveals that its growth rate reaches the maximum $\\sqrt{f(1-f)}$ in\nthe inviscid limit as the vertical wavenumber goes to infinity, where $f$ is\nthe dimensionless Coriolis parameter. The inertial instability for a finite\nvertical wavenumber is stabilized as the stratification increases, whereas it\nis destabilized by the thermal diffusion.

The drift pair bursts with positive and negative\nfrequency drifts, as well as the associated broadband type-III-like bursts, are\nproduced in the same regions. The visible source velocities are variable from\nzero to a few $10^4$ (up to ${\\sim 10^5}$) km/s, which often exceeds the\nvelocities inferred from the drift rate ($\\sim 10^4$ km/s). The visible source\nsizes are of about $10'-18'$; they are more compact than typical type III\nsources at the same frequencies. The existing models of drift pair bursts\ncannot adequately explain the observed features. We discuss the key issues that\nneed to be addressed, and in particular the anisotropic scattering of the radio\nwaves. The broadband bursts observed simultaneously with the drift pairs differ\nin some aspects from common type III bursts and may represent a separate type\nof emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 09:48:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

While the convergence\nspeed is critical for many emerging applications, most existing stochastic\noptimization methods suffer from slow convergence. Furthermore, the emerging\ntechnology of parallel computing has motivated an increasing demand for\ndesigning new stochastic optimization schemes that can handle parallel\noptimization for implementation in distributed systems. We propose a fast\nparallel stochastic optimization framework that can solve a large class of\npossibly non-convex stochastic optimization problems that may arise in\napplications with multi-agent systems. In the proposed method, each agent\nupdates its control variable in parallel, by solving a convex quadratic\nsubproblem independently. The convergence of the proposed method to the optimal\nsolution for convex problems and to a stationary point for general non-convex\nproblems is established. The proposed algorithm can be applied to solve a large\nclass of optimization problems arising in important applications from various\nfields, such as machine learning and wireless networks.

We perform\nhydrodynamical 2D spectral simulations of an SL, considering the disc as a\nsource of matter and angular momentum. Interaction of new, rapidly rotating\nmatter with the pre-existing, relatively slow material co-rotating with the\nstar leads to instabilities capable of transferring angular momentum and\ncreating variability on dynamical timescales. For small accretion rates, we\nfind that the SL is unstable for heating instability that disrupts the initial\nlatitudinal symmetry and produces large deviations between the two hemispheres.\nThis instability also results in breaking of the axial symmetry as coherent\nflow structures are formed and escape from the SL intermittently. At enhanced\naccretion rates, the SL is prone to shearing instability and acts as a source\nof oblique waves that propagate towards the poles, leading to patterns that\nagain break the axial symmetry. We compute artificial light curves of an SL\nviewed at different inclination angles. Most of the simulated light curves show\noscillations at frequencies close to 1kHz. We interpret these oscillations as\ninertial modes excited by shear instabilities near the boundary of the SL.\nTheir frequencies, dependence on flux, and amplitude variations can explain the\nhigh-frequency pair quasi-periodic oscillations observed in many low-mass X-ray\nbinaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 11:48:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 09:21:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

We study the emerging transport\nproperties for two types of reset time probability density functions (PDFs):\nexponential and Pareto. In the first case, we find the stationary distribution\nand a general expression for the stationary mean square displacement (MSD) in\nterms of the propagator. We find that the stationary MSD may increase, decrease\nor remain constant with the returning velocity. This depends on the moments of\nthe propagator. Regarding the Pareto resetting PDF we also study the stationary\ndistribution and the asymptotic scaling of the MSD for diffusive motion. In\nthis case, we see that the resetting modifies the transport regime, making the\noverall transport sub-diffusive and even reaching a stationary MSD., i.e., a\nstochastic localization. This phenomena is also observed in diffusion under\ninstantaneous Pareto resetting.

Boson sampling is a promising platform for such a goal,\nhowever, the number of involved single photons was up to five so far, limiting\nthese small-scale implementations to a proof-of-principle stage. Here, we\ndevelop solid-state sources of highly efficient, pure and indistinguishable\nsingle photons, and 3D integration of ultra-low-loss optical circuits. We\nperform an experiment with 20 single photons fed into a 60-mode interferometer,\nand, in its output, sample over Hilbert spaces with a size of $10^{14}$ $-$over\nten orders of magnitude larger than all previous experiments.

The operation moves subsets of activations horizontally and/or\nvertically. Spatial convolutions are then replaced with shift operations\nfollowed by point-wise convolutions, significantly reducing computational\ncosts. In this work, we investigate how shifts should best be applied to high\naccuracy CNNs. We apply shifts of two different neighbourhood groups to ResNet\non ImageNet: the originally introduced 8-connected (8C) neighbourhood shift and\nthe less well studied 4-connected (4C) neighbourhood shift. We find that when\nreplacing ResNet's spatial convolutions with shifts, both shift neighbourhoods\ngive equal ImageNet accuracy, showing the sufficiency of small neighbourhoods\nfor large images. Interestingly, when incorporating shifts to all point-wise\nconvolutions in residual networks, 4-connected shifts outperform 8-connected\nshifts. Such a 4-connected shift setup gives the same accuracy as full residual\nnetworks while reducing the number of parameters and FLOPs by over 40%. We then\nhighlight that without spatial convolutions, ResNet's downsampling/upsampling\nbottleneck channel structure is no longer needed. We show a new, 4C shift-based\nresidual network, much shorter than the original ResNet yet with a higher\naccuracy for the same computational cost. This network is the highest accuracy\nshift-based network yet shown, demonstrating the potential of shifting in deep\nneural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 12:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

To utilize the acoustic event\ninformation to improve the performance of ASC tasks, we present the cross-task\npre-training mechanism which utilizes acoustic event information from the\npre-trained AED model for ASC tasks. On the other hand, most of the models were\ndesigned and implemented on platforms with rich computing resources, and the\non-device applications were limited. To solve this problem, we use model\ndistillation method to compress our cross-task model to enable on-device\nacoustic scene classification. In this paper, the cross-task models and their\nstudent model were trained and evaluated on two datasets: TAU Urban Acoustic\nScenes 2019 dataset and TUT Acoustic Scenes 2017 dataset. Results have shown\nthat cross-task pre-training mechanism can significantly improve the\nperformance of ASC tasks. The performance of our best model improved relatively\n9.5% in the TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes 2019 dataset, and also improved 10% in\nthe TUT Acoustic Scenes 2017 dataset compared with the official baseline.

In this paper we\ninvestigate the relationship between quasirandomness of $T$ and the count of a\nsingle $h$-vertex tournament $H$ in $T$. We consider two types of counts, the\nglobal one and the local one.\n  We first observe that if $T$ has the correct global count of $H$ and $h \\geq\n7$ then quasirandomness of $T$ is only forced if $H$ is transitive. The next\nnatural question when studying quasirandom objects asks whether possessing the\ncorrect local counts of $H$ is enough to force quasirandomness of $T$. A\ntournament $H$ is said to be locally forcing if it has this property.\n  Variants of the local forcing problem have been studied before in both the\ngraph and hypergraph settings. Perhaps the closest analogue of our problem was\nconsidered by Simonovits and S\\'os who looked at whether having \"correct\ncounts\" of a fixed graph $H$ as an induced subgraph of $G$ implies $G$ must be\nquasirandom, in an appropriate sense. They proved that this is indeed the case\nwhen $H$ is regular and conjectured that it holds for all $H$ (except the path\non 3 vertices). Contrary to the Simonovits-S\\'os conjecture, in the tournament\nsetting we prove that a constant proportion of all tournaments are not locally\nforcing. In fact, any locally forcing tournament must itself be strongly\nquasirandom. On the other hand, unlike the global forcing case, we construct\ninfinite families of non-transitive locally forcing tournaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 12:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

Indeed, given only the observational assumption of the cosmological\nprinciple, it allows to study the today observed accelerated evolution of the\nHubble flow without assuming specific cosmological models. In general,\ncosmography is used to reconstruct the Hubble parameter as a function of the\nredshift, assuming an arbitrary fiducial value for the current matter density,\n$\\Omega_m$, and analysing low redshift cosmological data. Here we propose a\ndifferent strategy, linking together the parametric cosmographic behavior of\nthe late universe expansion with the small scale universe. In this way, we do\nnot need to assume any \"a priori\" values for the cosmological parameters, since\nthese are constrained at early epochs using both the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground Radiation (CMBR) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data. In\norder to test this strategy, we describe the late expansion of the universe\nusing the Pad\\'e polynomials. This approach is discussed in the light of the\nrecent $H(z)$ values indicators, combined with Supernovae Pantheon sample,\ngalaxy clustering and early universe data, as CMBR and BAO. We found an\ninteresting dependence of the current matter density value with cosmographic\nparameters, proving the inaccuracy of setting the value of $\\Omega_m$ in\ncosmographic analyses, and a non-negligible effect of the cosmographic\nparameters on the CMBR temperature anisotropy power spectrum. Finally, we found\nthat the cosmographic series, truncated at third order, shows a better $\\chi^2$\nbest fit value then the vanilla $\\Lambda$CDM model.

The goal of this study is to determine the origin\nof the enhanced ionization rate and to infer from multiwavelength observations\nthe spectrum of cosmic rays accelerated at the supernova remnant shock in the\nunprecedented range spanning from MeV to multi-TeV particle energies. We\ndeveloped a model to describe the transport of X-ray photons into the molecular\ncloud, and we fitted the radio, millimeter, and gamma-ray data to derive the\nspectrum of the radiating particles. The contribution from X-ray photons to the\nenhanced ionization rate is negligible, and therefore the ionization must be\ndue to cosmic rays. Even though we cannot exclude a contribution to the\nionization rate coming from cosmic ray electrons, we show that a scenario where\ncosmic ray protons explain both the gamma-ray flux and the enhanced ionization\nrate provides the most natural fit to multiwavelength data. This strongly\nsuggests that the intensity of CR protons is enhanced in the region for\nparticle energies in a very broad range covering almost 6 orders of magnitude:\nfrom $\\lesssim 100$ MeV up to several tens of TeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 14:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

These kilometre-sized KBOs are\nextremely faint, and it is impossible to detect them directly. Instead,\nmonitoring of stellar occultation events is one possible way to discover these\nsmall KBOs.

In this paper we focus on a new method, called\ndual polarization beamforming (DPBF), to design beam patterns. Instead of using\nonly a single element-polarization, as for SPBF, a desired beam pattern is\ndesigned as the sum of powers for two orthogonal element-polarizations. So,\nwith DPBF the focus is on total radiated power beam patterns. The DPBF\ntechnique provides additional degrees of freedom to form a desired beam pattern\nsuch that amplitude variations in the beamforming vector can often be\nsignificantly reduced, potentially to uniform amplitude. Phase-only\nbeamforming, possibly using only minor amplitude variations, is a very\ninteresting property, especially for active antennas, since it offers the\npotential of full power amplifier utilization. In this paper we apply DPBF to\nuniform linear arrays (ULAs) as well as uniform rectangular arrays (URAs).

In this paper, we\nexplore two alternative data sources to improve aerial action classification\nwhen only a few training aerial examples are available. As a first data source,\nwe resort to video games. We collect plenty of aerial game action videos using\ntwo gaming engines. For the second data source, we leverage conditional\nWasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks to generate aerial features from\nground videos. Given that both data sources have some limitations, e.g. game\nvideos are biased towards specific actions categories (fighting, shooting,\netc.,), and it is not easy to generate good discriminative GAN-generated\nfeatures for all types of actions, we need to efficiently integrate two dataset\nsources with few available real aerial training videos. To address this\nchallenge of the heterogeneous nature of the data, we propose to use a disjoint\nmultitask learning framework.

Paradigms underlying this problem fall within\nthe so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is acknowledged as a crucial\nfeature for the practical deployment of AI models. This overview examines the\nexisting literature in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is\nyet to be reached. We summarize previous efforts to define explainability in\nMachine Learning, establishing a novel definition that covers prior conceptual\npropositions with a major focus on the audience for which explainability is\nsought. We then propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions\nrelated to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including\nthose aimed at Deep Learning methods for which a second taxonomy is built. This\nliterature analysis serves as the background for a series of challenges faced\nby XAI, such as the crossroads between data fusion and explainability.

Since optical flow is used in several safety-critical\napplications like self-driving cars, it is important to gain insights into the\nrobustness of those techniques. Recently, it has been shown that adversarial\nattacks easily fool deep neural networks to misclassify objects. The robustness\nof optical flow networks to adversarial attacks, however, has not been studied\nso far. In this paper, we extend adversarial patch attacks to optical flow\nnetworks and show that such attacks can compromise their performance. We show\nthat corrupting a small patch of less than 1% of the image size can\nsignificantly affect optical flow estimates. Our attacks lead to noisy flow\nestimates that extend significantly beyond the region of the attack, in many\ncases even completely erasing the motion of objects in the scene. While\nnetworks using an encoder-decoder architecture are very sensitive to these\nattacks, we found that networks using a spatial pyramid architecture are less\naffected. We analyse the success and failure of attacking both architectures by\nvisualizing their feature maps and comparing them to classical optical flow\ntechniques which are robust to these attacks.

Capturing both, semantic content and motion,\nalong the video frames is key to achieve high accuracy performance on this\ntask. Most of the state-of-the-art methods rely on RGB frames for extracting\nthe semantics and pre-computed optical flow fields as a motion cue. Then, both\nare combined using deep neural networks. Yet, it has been argued that such\nmodels are not able to leverage the motion information extracted from the\noptical flow, but instead the optical flow allows for better recognition of\npeople and objects in the video. This urges the need to explore different cues\nor models that can extract motion in a more informative fashion. To tackle this\nissue, we propose to explore the predictive coding network, so called PredNet,\na recurrent neural network that propagates predictive coding errors across\nlayers and time steps. We analyze whether PredNet can better capture motions in\nvideos by estimating over time the representations extracted from pre-trained\nnetworks for action recognition.

The calculated mass value of the ions from the\ntime-of-flight is dependent on the duration of the field transition up to full\nstrength. For novel applications dedicated to precision measurements, such as\nmulti-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometry of short-lived isotopes, the\ngoal is to continuously decrease the measurement uncertainty while providing a\nmass accuracy on the same order. Even though dynamic-field models for\ntime-of-flight mass spectrometry have been considered in the past for\ntechnological advances, it is important to study the accuracy of the measured\nmass in this context. Using a simplified linear model for the field transition,\nwe provide a basic investigation of the scenario, and discuss the deviation\nfrom the classical \"mass-over-charge\" dependency of the ions' time-of-flight,\nwhich becomes violated.

Second, we\ndemonstrate empirically an improvement in the approximation quality of the\nNP-hard problem of inference over the square-grid Ising model in a\nnode-dependent non-zero \"magnetic\" field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 10:39:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

This scheme will be particularly useful for performing parameter\ninference on spatial moment models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 03:07:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 01:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

However, this is not as simple\nas instantaneously closing down all fossil fuel energy generation and replacing\nthem with renewable sources -- careful decisions need to be taken to ensure\nrapid but stable progress. To aid decision makers, we present a new tool,\nElecSim, which is an open-sourced agent-based modelling framework used to\nexamine the effect of policy on long-term investment decisions in electricity\ngeneration. ElecSim allows non-experts to rapidly prototype new ideas.\n  Different techniques to model long-term electricity decisions are reviewed\nand used to motivate why agent-based models will become an important strategic\ntool for policy. We motivate why an open-source toolkit is required for\nlong-term electricity planning.\n  Actual electricity prices are compared with our model and we demonstrate that\nthe use of a Monte-Carlo simulation in the system improves performance by\n$52.5\\%$. Further, using ElecSim we demonstrate the effect of a carbon tax to\nencourage a low-carbon electricity supply. We show how a {\\pounds}40 ($\\$50$)\nper tonne of CO2 emitted would lead to 70% renewable electricity by 2050.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 10:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

The analysis of\nreferences included in the manuscripts revealed that the subset of accepted\nsubmissions were more likely to cite the same publications.

However,\ndue to the broadcast nature of radio channels, the transmissions are vulnerable\nto eavesdropping. In this paper, we propose a cooperative secret key agreement\n(CoopKey) scheme for encrypting/decrypting the control messages, where the\nvehicles in PVCPS generate a unified secret key based on the quantized fading\nchannel randomness. Channel quantization intervals are optimized by dynamic\nprogramming to minimize the mismatch of keys. A platooning testbed is built\nwith autonomous robotic vehicles, where a TelosB wireless node is used for\nonboard data processing and multi-hop dissemination. Extensive real-world\nexperiments demonstrate that CoopKey achieves significantly low secret bit\nmismatch rate in a variety of settings. Moreover, the standard NIST test suite\nis employed to verify randomness of the generated keys, where the p-values of\nour CoopKey pass all the randomness tests. We also evaluate CoopKey with an\nextended platoon size via simulations to investigate the effect of system\nscalability on performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 00:49:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}
