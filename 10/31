Deep networks generally require large amounts of labeled training\ndata, which are readily available for 2-D images but are difficult to produce\nfor 3-D point clouds. In this letter, we present Label Diffusion Lidar\nSegmentation (LDLS), a novel approach for 3-D point cloud segmentation, which\nleverages 2-D segmentation of an RGB image from an aligned camera to avoid the\nneed for training on annotated 3-D data.

We\nconduct empirical studies on the KITTI benchmark dataset and on a mobile robot,\ndemonstrating wide applicability and superior performance of LDLS compared with\nthe previous state of the art in 3-D point cloud segmentation, without any need\nfor either 3-D training data or fine tuning of the 2-D image segmentation\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-31"}

We computed numerical simulations of nonlinear\nwave propagation in a sunspot and constructed synthetic Stokes profiles in the\nCa II 8542 \\AA\\ line during an umbral flash using the NLTE code NICOLE. The\nspectral resolution of the Stokes profiles was downgraded to various cases with\ndifferences in the wavelength coverage.

Chemical\nclocks could help alleviating this problem, but their evolution strongly\ndepends on many parameters, leading to degeneracy in the interpretation of the\nobservational data. One of these uncertainties is the degree of CO depletion.\nWe present here the first self-consistent magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of\nhigh-mass star-forming regions at different scales, fully coupled with a\nnon-equilibrium chemical network, which includes C-N-O bearing molecules.\nDepletion and desorption processes are treated time-dependently. The results\nshow that full CO-depletion (i.e. all gas-phase CO frozen-out on the surface of\ndust grains), can be reached very quickly, in one third or even smaller\nfractions of the free-fall time, whether the collapse proceeds on slow or fast\ntimescales. This leads to a high level of deuteration in a short time both for\ntypical tracers like N$_2$H$^+$, as well as for the main ion H$_3^+$, the\nlatter being in general larger and more extended. N$_2$ depletion is slightly\nless efficient, and no direct effects on N-bearing molecules and deuterium\nfractionation are observed.

The cluster has an Einstein radius of\nErad=14 for a source at z = 3 and a mass within 500 kpc of M_500kpc =\n4.0+-0.8x10^14Msol. Our spectroscopic identification of three multiply-imaged\nsystems (z = 2.363, z = 2.364, and z = 3.048), combined with HST F606W-band\nimaging allows us to build a strong lensing model for this cluster with an rms\nof <0.3'' between the predicted and measured positions of the multiple images.\nOur modeling reveals a two-component mass distribution in the cluster. One mass\ncomponent is dominated by the brightest cluster galaxy and the other component,\nseparated by ~170 kpc, contains a group of eight red elliptical galaxies\nconfined in a ~9'' (~70 kpc) diameter circle. We estimate the mass ratio\nbetween the two components to be between 1:1.25 and 1:1.58. In addition,\nspectroscopic data reveal that these two near-equal mass cores have only a\nsmall velocity difference of 300 km/s between the two components. This small\nradial velocity difference suggests that most of the relative velocity takes\nplace in the plane of the sky, and implies that SPT-CL J0356-5337 is a major\nmerger with a small impact parameter seen face-on. We also assess the relative\ncontributions of galaxy-scale halos to the overall mass of the core of the\ncluster and find that within 800 kpc from the brightest cluster galaxy about\n27% of the total mass can be attributed to visible and dark matter associated\nwith galaxies, whereas only 73% of the total mass in the core comes from\ncluster-scale dark matter halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

Candidates can have different weights. A committee is a subset of\ncandidates, and its weight is the sum of weights of its candidates. Each voter\nexpresses an ordinal ranking over all possible committees. The only assumption\nwe make on preferences is monotonicity: If $S \\subseteq S'$ are two committees,\nthen any voter weakly prefers $S'$ to $S$. We study a general notion of group\nfairness via stability: A committee of given total weight $K$ is stable if no\ncoalition of voters can deviate and choose a committee of proportional weight,\nso that all these voters strictly prefer the new committee to the existing one.\nExtending this notion to approximation, for parameter $c \\ge 1$, a committee\n$S$ of weight $K$ is said to be $c$-approximately stable if for any other\ncommittee $S'$ of weight $K'$, the fraction of voters that strictly prefer $S'$\nto $S$ is strictly less than $\\frac{c K'}{K}$. When $c = 1$, this condition is\nequivalent to classical core stability. The question we ask is: Does a\n$c$-approximately stable committee of weight at most any given value $K$ always\nexist for constant $c$? It is relatively easy to show that there exist monotone\npreferences for which $c \\ge 2$. However, even for simple and widely studied\npreference structures, a non-trivial upper bound on $c$ has been elusive. In\nthis paper, we show that $c = O(1)$ for all monotone preference structures. Our\nproof proceeds via showing an existence result for a randomized notion of\nstability, and iteratively rounding the resulting fractional solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:45:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Nov 2019 23:48:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 03:35:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

However, about 10% of them, including 78 Vir,\nhave strong, large-scale surface magnetic fields whose origin has remained a\nmajor mystery. The massive star $\\tau$ Sco is a prominent member of this group\nand appears to be surprisingly young compared to other presumably coeval\nmembers of the Upper Scorpius association. Here, we present the first 3D\nmagneto-hydrodynamical simulations of the coalescence of two massive\nmain-sequence stars and 1D stellar evolution computations of the subsequent\nevolution of the merger product that can explain $\\tau$ Sco's magnetic field,\napparent youth and other observed characteristics. We argue that field\namplification in stellar mergers is a general mechanism to form\nstrongly-magnetised massive stars. These stars are promising progenitors of\nthose neutron stars that host the strongest magnetic fields in the Universe,\nso-called magnetars, and that may give rise to some of the enigmatic fast radio\nbursts. Strong magnetic fields affect the explosions of core-collapse\nsupernovae and, moreover, those magnetic stars that have rapidly-rotating cores\nat the end of their lives might provide the right conditions to power\nlong-duration gamma-ray bursts and super-luminous supernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 18:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-01"}

To\nutilize the topology information while staying robust under different\ntriangulation, we propose to encode mesh connectivity using Laplacian spectral\nanalysis, along with Mesh Pooling Blocks (MPBs) that can split the surface\ndomain into local pooling patches and aggregate global information among them.\nWe build a mesh hierarchy from fine to coarse using Laplacian spectral\nclustering, which is flexible under isometric transformation.

In this work, we derive, implement, and evaluate\nan efficient method to simultaneously sample the result of applying any\nconstant pulling force within a specified range to a molecular system of\ninterest. We start from Simulated Tempering in Force, whereby force is applied\nas a linear bias on a collective variable to the system's Hamiltonian, and the\ncoefficient is taken as a continuous auxiliary degree of freedom. We derive a\nformula for an average collective-variable-dependent force, which depends on a\nset of weights, learned on-the-fly throughout a simulation, that reflect the\nlimit where force varies infinitely quickly. These weights can then be used to\nretroactively compute averages of any observable at any force within the\nspecified range. This technique is based on recent work deriving similar\nequations for Infinite Switch Simulated Tempering in Temperature, that showed\nthe infinite switch limit is the most efficient for sampling. Here, we\ndemonstrate that our method accurately and simultaneously samples molecular\nsystems at all forces within a user defined force range, and show how it can\nserve as an enhanced sampling tool for cases where the pulling direction\ndestabilizes states of low free-energy at zero-force.

Contrary to intuition,\nthe population of opposite chiralities is surprisingly asymmetric at\nfundamental levels. Examples range from parity violation in the subatomic weak\nforce to the homochirality in essential biomolecules. The ability to achieve\nchirality-selective synthesis (chiral induction) is of great importance in\nstereochemistry, molecular biology and pharmacology. In condensed matter\nphysics, a crystalline electronic system is geometrically chiral when it lacks\nany mirror plane, space inversion center or roto-inversion axis. Typically, the\ngeometrical chirality is predefined by a material's chiral lattice structure,\nwhich is fixed upon the formation of the crystal. By contrast, a particularly\nunconventional scenario is the gyrotropic order, where chirality spontaneously\nemerges across a phase transition as the electron system breaks the relevant\nsymmetries of an originally achiral lattice. Such a gyrotropic order, proposed\nas the quantum analogue of the cholesteric liquid crystals, has attracted\nsignificant interest. However, to date, a clear observation and manipulation of\nthe gyrotropic order remain challenging. We report the realization of optical\nchiral induction and the observation of a gyrotropically ordered phase in the\ntransition-metal dichalcogenide semimetal $1T$-TiSe$_2$.

We aim at improving this conversion via the application of\nmagneto-hydrostatic (MHS) equilibrium instead of HE. We develop a method to\nsolve the momentum equation under MHS equilibrium (i.e., taking the Lorentz\nforce into account) in three dimensions. The method is based on the solution of\na Poisson-like equation. Considering the gas pressure $P_{\\rm g}$ and density\n$\\rho$ from three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of\nsunspots as a benchmark, we compare the results from the application of HE and\nMHS equilibrium. We find that HE retrieves the gas pressure and density within\nan order of magnitude of the MHD values in only about 47 \\% of the domain. This\ntranslates into an error of about $160-200$ km in the determination of the\n$z-\\tau_{\\rm c}$ conversion. On the other hand, the application of MHS\nequilibrium allows determination of $P_{\\rm g}$ and $\\rho$ within an order of\nmagnitude in 84 \\% of the domain. In this latter case, the $z-\\tau_{\\rm c}$\nconversion is obtained with an accuracy of $30-70$ km.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 20:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

Recently (2017) it was shown that existing\nsecure logging protocols are vulnerable to crash attack in which the adversary\nmodifies the log file and then crashes the system to make it indistinguishable\nfrom a normal system crash. The attacker was assumed to be non-adaptive and not\nbe able to see the file content before modifying and crashing it (which will be\nimmediately after modifying the file). The authors also proposed a system\ncalled SLiC that protects against this attacker. In this paper, we consider an\n(insider) adaptive adversary who can see the file content as new log operations\nare performed. This is a powerful adversary who can attempt to rewind the\nsystem to a past state. We formalize security against this adversary and\nintroduce a scheme with provable security. We show that security against this\nattacker requires some (small) protected memory that can become accessible to\nthe attacker after the system compromise. We show that existing secure logging\nschemes are insecure in this setting, even if the system provides some\nprotected memory as above. We propose a novel mechanism that, in its basic\nform, uses a pair of keys that evolve at different rates, and employ this\nmechanism in an existing logging scheme that has forward integrity to obtain a\nsystem with provable security against adaptive (and hence non-adaptive) crash\nattack. We implemented our scheme on a desktop computer and a Raspberry Pi, and\nshowed in addition to higher security, a significant efficiency gain over SLiC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 22:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-01"}

An acquisition scheme was developed entitled\nMultisection Excitation by Simultaneous Spin-echo Interleaving (MESSI) with\ncomplex-encoded generalized SLIce Dithered Enhanced Resolution (cgSlider).\nMESSI utilizes the dead-time during the long TE by interleaving the excitation\nand readout of two slices to enable 2x slice-acceleration, while cgSlider\nutilizes the stable temporal background phase in SE-fMRI to encode and decode\ntwo adjacent slices simultaneously with a phase-constrained reconstruction\nmethod.

We perform a stochastic neighborhood embedding\nand identify clusters of spectra, and demonstrate that these clusters are\ncorrelated with the covalent structure of the molecules. Secondly, we propose a\nsimple and efficient method, aided by a quantum simulator, to extract the NMR\nspectrum of any hypothetical molecule described by a parametric Heisenberg\nmodel. Thirdly, we propose an efficient variational Bayesian inference\nprocedure for extracting Hamiltonian parameters of experimentally relevant NMR\nspectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 02:37:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 15:22:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework for\nhybrid beamformer design in broadband mm-Wave massive MIMO systems. We design a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) that accepts the channel matrix of all\nsubcarriers as input and the output of CNN is the hybrid beamformers. The\nproposed CNN architecture is trained with imperfect channel matrices in order\nto provide robust performance against the deviations in the channel data.\nHence, the proposed precoding scheme can handle the imperfect or limited\nfeedback scenario where the full and exact knowledge of the channel is not\navailable.

Both the\nregularizers mentioned above are formulated by assuming certain priors in the\nparameter space and these assumptions, in some cases, induce sparsity in the\nparameter space. Regularizers help in transferring beliefs one has on the\ndataset or the parameter space by introducing adequate terms in the loss\nfunction. Any kind of formulation represents a specific set of beliefs: $L_1$\nregularization conveys that the parameter space should be sparse whereas $L_2$\nregularization conveys that the parameter space should be bounded and\ncontinuous. These regularizers in turn leverage certain priors to express these\ninherent beliefs. A better understanding of how the prior affects the behavior\nof the parameters and how the priors can be updated based on the dataset can\ncontribute greatly in improving the generalization capabilities of a function\nestimator. In this work, we introduce a weakly informative prior and then\nfurther extend it to an informative prior in order to formulate a\nregularization penalty, which shows better results in terms of inducing\nsparsity experimentally, when compared to regularizers based only on Gaussian\nand Laplacian priors. Experimentally, we verify that a regularizer based on an\nadapted prior improves the generalization capabilities of any network.

High redshift galaxies are significantly more\ncompact than galaxies observed today, at an equivalent mass, but how much of\nthis apparent growth is driven by progenitor bias, minor mergers, secular\nprocesses, or feedback from AGN is unclear. To help disentangle the physical\nmechanisms at work by addressing the latter, we study the galaxy size -\nMstellar relation of 32 carefully-selected broad-line AGN hosts at 1.2 < z <\n1.7 (7.5 < log M_BH < 8.5; L_bol/L_Edd > 0.1). Using HST with multi-band\nphotometry and state-of-the-art modeling techniques, we measure half-light\nradii while accounting for uncertainties from subtracting bright central point\nsources. We find AGN hosts to have sizes ranging from 1 to 6 kpc at Mstellar ~\n0.3 - 1 x 10^11 Msun. Thus, many hosts have intermediate sizes as compared to\nequal-mass star-forming and quiescent galaxies. While inconsistent with the\nidea that AGN feedback may induce an increase in galaxy sizes, this finding is\nconsistent with hypotheses in which AGNs preferentially occur in systems with\nprior concentrated gas reservoirs, or are involved in secular compaction\nprocesses perhaps responsible for simultaneously building bulges and shutting\ndown star formation. If driven by minor mergers, which do not grow central\nblack holes as fast as they do bulge-like stellar structures, such a process\nwould explain both the galaxy size - mass relation observed here and the\nevolution in the black hole, bulge mass relation described in a companion\npaper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 03:43:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In this\ncase, the background field can induce an undesired field-dependent additive\nmass renormalisation that acts to change the quark mass as the background field\nis changed. For example, in a calculation utilising Wilson fermions in a\nuniform background magnetic field, the Wilson term introduced a field-dependent\nrenormalisation to the quark mass which manifests itself in an unphysical\nincrease of the neutral-pion mass for large magnetic fields.

This is true, for instance, with pair-wise\nmatchers (e.g., deep Siamese networks) that typically rely on a reference\ngallery with one still image per individual. However, generating synthetic\nimages in the source domain may not improve the performance during operations\ndue to the domain shift w.r.t. the target domain. Moreover, despite the\nemergence of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for realistic synthetic\ngeneration, it is often difficult to control the conditions under which\nsynthetic faces are generated. In this paper, a cross-domain face synthesis\napproach is proposed that integrates a new Controllable GAN (C-GAN). It employs\nan off-the-shelf 3D face model as a simulator to generate face images under\nvarious poses. The simulated images and noise are input to the C-GAN for\nrealism refinement which employs an additional adversarial game as a third\nplayer to preserve the identity and specific facial attributes of the refined\nimages. This allows generating realistic synthetic face images that reflects\ncapture conditions in the target domain while controlling the GAN output to\ngenerate faces under desired pose conditions. Experiments were performed using\nvideos from the Chokepoint and COX-S2V datasets, and a deep Siamese network for\nFR with a single reference still per person.

In this paper, we study the EVH limit\nof asymptotically AdS black holes which preserve some supersymmetry. The\nprimary example we consider is the 1/16$^{\\rm th}$ BPS asymptotically AdS$_5$\nblack hole, whose EVH limit has an AdS$_3$ factor in its near-horizon geometry.\nWe also consider the near-EVH limit of this black hole, in which the\nnear-horizon geometry instead contains an extremal BTZ factor.

In particular, we show that the inverse Laplace\ntransform of the superconformal index, yielding the black hole entropy, becomes\nequivalent to the derivation of a Cardy formula for the dual CFT$_2$.

For the quasilocal bath, we establish that there is a steady\ngeneration of Majorana correlations in asymptotic time and the presence of an\noptimal ramping time which facilitates a quicker approach to the topological\nsteady state. In the second scenario, we analyze the action of a local\nparticle-loss type of bath in which we have established the existence of an\noptimal ramping time which results from the competing dynamics between the\nunitary ramp and the dissipative coupling.

However, the recent introduction of\nreconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which have the potential to\ninfluence the propagation environment in a controlled manner, has the potential\nto change the previous paradigm. Motivated by this, we study the channel\ncapacity optimization utilizing RISs in indoor mmWave environments where no LOS\npath is present. More precisely, we propose two optimization schemes that\nexploit the customizing capabilities of the RIS reflection elements in order to\nmaximize the channel capacity. The first optimization scheme exploits only the\nadjustability of the RIS reflection elements; for this scheme we derive an\napproximate expression which explains the connection between the channel\ncapacity gains and the system parameters. The second optimization scheme\njointly optimizes the RIS reflection elements and the transmit phase precoder;\nfor this scheme, we propose a low-complexity technique called global co-phasing\nto determine the phase shift values for use at the RIS. Simulation results show\nthat the optimization of the RIS reflection elements produces a significant\nchannel capacity gain, and that this gain increases with the number of RIS\nelements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 08:48:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Feb 2020 18:24:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

The device-edge co-inference framework provides a promising solution\nby splitting a neural network at a mobile device and an edge computing server.\nIn order to balance the on-device computation and the communication overhead,\nthe splitting point needs to be carefully picked, while the intermediate\nfeature needs to be compressed before transmission. Existing studies decoupled\nthe design of model splitting, feature compression, and communication, which\nmay lead to excessive resource consumption of the mobile device. In this paper,\nwe introduce an end-to-end architecture, named BottleNet++, that consists of an\nencoder, a non-trainable channel layer, and a decoder for more efficient\nfeature compression and transmission. The encoder and decoder essentially\nimplement joint source-channel coding via convolutional neural networks (CNNs),\nwhile explicitly considering the effect of channel noise. By exploiting the\nstrong sparsity and the fault-tolerant property of the intermediate feature in\na deep neural network (DNN), BottleNet++ achieves a much higher compression\nratio than existing methods. Furthermore, by providing the channel condition to\nthe encoder as an input, our method enjoys a strong generalization ability in\ndifferent channel conditions. Compared with merely transmitting intermediate\ndata without feature compression, BottleNet++ achieves up to 64x bandwidth\nreduction over the additive white Gaussian noise channel and up to 256x bit\ncompression ratio in the binary erasure channel, with less than 2% reduction in\naccuracy.

A popular approach is to formally replace the proximal\noperator within the ADMM framework with some powerful denoiser. However, since\nmost state-of-the-art denoisers cannot be posed as a proximal operator, one\ncannot guarantee the convergence of these so-called plug-and-play (PnP)\nalgorithms. In fact, the theoretical convergence of PnP algorithms is an active\nresearch topic. In this letter, we consider the result of Chan et al. (IEEE\nTCI, 2017), where fixed-point convergence of an ADMM-based PnP algorithm was\nestablished for a class of denoisers. We argue that the original proof is\nincomplete, since convergence is not analyzed for one of the three possible\ncases outlined in the paper. Moreover, we explain why the argument for the\nother cases does not apply in this case. We give a different analysis to fill\nthis gap, which firmly establishes the original convergence theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:19:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In dynamical simulations water\ndelivery is still studied almost exclusively by assuming oversimplified perfect\nmerging (PM), even though it is particularly prone to collisional transfer and\nloss. To close this gap we have developed a framework to model collisional\nwater transport by direct combination of long-term N-body computations with\ndedicated 3D SPH simulations for each collision. Post-collision water\ninventories are self-consistently traced further, in accretionary or erosive as\nwell as hit-and-run encounters. The latter are frequent outcomes among\nprotoplanets, where besides collisional losses, water transfer between the\nencountering bodies has to be considered. This hybrid approach enables us for\nthe first time to trace the full dynamical and collisional evolution of ~200\nbodies throughout the whole late-stage accretion phase (several 100 Myrs). As a\nfirst application we choose a Solar System-like architecture, with already\nformed giant planets on either circular or eccentric orbits and a debris disk\nspanning from 0.5 - 4 au. Realistic collision treatment leads to considerably\ndifferent results than PM, with lower mass planets and water inventories\nreduced by a factor of two or more. Due to a combination of collisional losses\nand considerably lengthened accretion, final water contents especially with\ngiant planets on circular orbits are strongly reduced to more Earth-like\nvalues. Water delivery to potentially habitable planets is dominated by few\ndecisive collisions, mostly with embryo-sized or larger bodies.

The\nreality is that atomic diffusion is in competition with other transport\nprocesses. The purpose of this study is to quantify the opposite or conjugated\neffects of atomic diffusion and rotationally induced mixing in stellar models\nof low mass stars. Our second goal is to estimate the impact of neglecting both\nrotational mixing and atomic diffusion in stellar parameter inferences for\nstars with masses larger than 1.3Msun.

We show\nthat for masses lower than 1.3Msun, rotation dominates the transport of\nchemical elements, and strongly reduces the effect of atomic diffusion, with\nnet surface abundance modifications similar to solar ones. At larger mass,\natomic diffusion and rotation are competing equally.

D2D channel condition is local to\ndevices/user equipments (UEs) and hence is \\textit{not} directly visible to the\nbase station (BS). Thus quality of the D2D channel needs to be propagated to BS\nby UEs which may incur some delay. Hence the solution provided by BS to UEs\nusing this gathered channel information might become less useful to establish\ncommunication due to moving obstacles. These types of obstacles might not be\nknown in advance and hence may cause unpredictable fluctuations to the D2D\nchannel quality. Hence we seek to learn the D2D channels using the finite\nhorizon partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework to model\nthe uncertainty in such kind of network environments with dynamic obstacles.\nThe objective is to minimize delay when channel quality deteriorates, by making\nUEs choose locally the best possible decision between i) to continue on the\ncurrent relay link on which communication is taking place or ii) to switch to\nanother good relay by exploring other possible UEs in its locality. We derive\nan optimal threshold policy which tells the UE to take appropriate decision\nlocally. Later, we give a simplified and easy to implement stationary threshold\npolicy which counts the number of successive acknowledgement failures, based on\nwhich UE make appropriate decision locally. Through extensive simulation, we\ndemonstrate that our approach outperforms recent algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 10:55:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 13:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-13"}

Following this framework, we\nhere construct a reduced model from a small, efficiently computable random\nobject called a sketch of a reduced model, using minimal residual methods. We\nintroduce a sketched version of the minimal residual based projection as well\nas a novel nonlinear approximation method, where for each parameter value, the\nsolution is approximated by minimal residual projection onto a subspace spanned\nby several vectors picked (online) from a dictionary of candidate basis\nvectors. It is shown that random sketching technique can improve not only\nefficiency but also numerical stability. A rigorous analysis of the conditions\non the random sketch required to obtain a given accuracy is presented. These\nconditions may be ensured a priori with high probability by considering for the\nsketching matrix an oblivious embedding of sufficiently large size.\nFurthermore, a simple and reliable procedure for a posteriori verification of\nthe quality of the sketch is provided. This approach can be used for\ncertification of the approximation as well as for adaptive selection of the\nsize of the random sketching matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 11:20:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 18:21:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}

Many existing algorithms fall into this category.\nAnalogous to genetic drift in EAs, EDAs also encounter the phenomenon that\nupdates of the probabilistic model not justified by the fitness move the\nsampling frequencies to the boundary values. This can result in a considerable\nperformance loss.\n  This paper proves the first sharp estimates of the boundary hitting time of\nthe sampling frequency of a neutral bit for several univariate EDAs.

To this extent, in this work, we propose a novel\nprobabilistic framework, Airavata, to estimate the information leakage in such\nmodel extraction attacks. This framework captures the fact that extracting the\nexact target model is difficult due to experimental uncertainty while inferring\nmodel hyperparameters and stochastic nature of training to steal the target\nmodel functionality. Specifically, we use Bayesian Networks to capture\nuncertainty in estimating the target model under various extraction attacks\nbased on the subjective notion of probability. We validate the proposed\nframework under different adversary assumptions commonly adopted in literature\nto reason about the attack efficacy. This provides a practical tool to infer\nactionable details about extracting blackbox models and help identify the best\nattack combination which maximises the knowledge extracted (or information\nleaked) from the target model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:05:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 2020 06:57:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

Hence, GSD-ST turns the problem of decomposing $k$\ngeometric sequences into one of solving a $k$-th order polynomial equation.

However,\ntransport properties in the two limits are yet unstudied, particularly in a\nstatistically consistent manner. Here, we experimentally measure light\ntransport across two-dimensional open mesoscopic structures, wherein the\ndisorder systematically ranges from nearly-periodic to amorphous. We measure\nthe generalized conductance, which quantifies the transport probability in the\nsample. Although localization was identified in both the limits, statistical\nmeasurements revealed a discrepant behavior in the generalized conductance\nfluctuations in the two disorder regimes. Under amorphous disorder, the\ngeneralized conductance remains below unity for any configuration of the\ndisorder, attesting to the arrested nature of transport.

In order to discriminate\nbetween pulsar and DM sources, we developed a new method which is based on the\nsource's spectral curvature, peak energy, and its detection significance. We\nalso look for spatial extension, which may be a hint for a DM origin according\nto our N-body simulation studies of the subhalo population.

This value is updated, at each iteration, to a weighted average of\nitself and of the values of the adjacent agents. It is well known that, under\nnatural assumptions on the network's graph connectivity, this local averaging\nprocedure eventually leads to global consensus, or synchronization of the\nvalues at all nodes. Applications of iterative averaging include, but are not\nlimited to, algorithms for distributed optimization, for solution of linear and\nnonlinear equations, for multi-robot coordination and for opinion formation in\nsocial groups.

Existing deep architectures are either\nmanually designed or automatically searched by some Neural Architecture Search\n(NAS) methods. However, even a well-searched architecture may still contain\nmany non-significant or redundant modules or operations (e.g., convolution or\npooling), which may not only incur substantial memory consumption and\ncomputation cost but also deteriorate the performance. Thus, it is necessary to\noptimize the operations inside an architecture to improve the performance\nwithout introducing extra computation cost. Unfortunately, such a constrained\noptimization problem is NP-hard. To make the problem feasible, we cast the\noptimization problem into a Markov decision process (MDP) and seek to learn a\nNeural Architecture Transformer (NAT) to replace the redundant operations with\nthe more computationally efficient ones (e.g., skip connection or directly\nremoving the connection). Based on MDP, we learn NAT by exploiting\nreinforcement learning to obtain the optimization policies w.r.t. different\narchitectures. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, we apply\nNAT on both hand-crafted architectures and NAS based architectures. Extensive\nexperiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, demonstrate\nthat the transformed architecture by NAT significantly outperforms both its\noriginal form and those architectures optimized by existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:29:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 05:26:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 2019 16:00:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 11:24:12 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 13:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-14"}

A narrow reading of that literature has led many authors to\nneglect the contribution to the total uncertainty of performance assessment\nfrom the finite training sample. Yet the latter is a fundamental indicator of\nthe stability of a classifier; thus its neglect may be contributing to the\nproblematic status of many studies. A three-level strategy is proposed for\nmoving forward in this field. The lowest level is that of construction, where\ncandidate features are selected and the choice of classifier architecture is\nmade. At that point, the effective dimensionality of the classifier is\nestimated and used to size the next level of analysis, a pilot study on\npreviously unseen cases. The total (training and testing) uncertainty resulting\nfrom the pilot study is, in turn, used to size the highest level of analysis, a\npivotal study with a target level of uncertainty. Some resources available in\nthe literature for implementing this approach are reviewed.

Our sample comprises the hosts and\nhost-galaxy candidates of 16 short-GRBs from 2005 to 2015, corresponding to\nroughly 1/3 of the presently known ensemble of well-localized short bursts.\nEight GRB fields were observed with ATCA (at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz), and eight fields\nwith the VLA (mostly at 5.5 GHz). The observations typically achieved a\n1-sigma_rms of 5 to 8 microJy. In most cases they were performed years after\nthe corresponding burst. No new short-GRB host with optically obscured star\nformation was found. Only one host galaxy was detected, the one of GRB 100206A\nat z=0.407. However, its starburst nature was already known from optical/IR\ndata. Its measured radio flux can be interpreted as being due to a star\nformation rate (SFR) of about 60 M_sol/yr. This is in good agreement with\nearlier expectations based on the observed broad-band spectral energy\ndistribution of this galaxy. The 15 non-detections constrain the SFRs of the\nsuspected host galaxies and provide upper limits on late-time luminosities of\nthe associated radio afterglows and predicted kilonova radio flares.

Driven by the variations of fuel costs, system\nloads and weathers, these market participants compete actively and behave\nvariously in the power market. Although electricity markets tend to become more\ntransparent, a large amount of market information is still not publicly\navailable to market participants. Hence, data-driven analysis based on public\ndata is crucial for market participants to better understand and model\nlarge-scale power markets, and ultimately to perform better in power trading.\nWhile most of the previous researches related to the large-scale power markets\nare based on the synthetic networks, a data-driven approach utilizing the real\npower market data is proposed in this paper. First, the power plants' monthly\nnet generation and capacity data are obtained from U.S. Energy Information\nAdministration (EIA) and aggregated to figure out the monthly regional capacity\nfactors which are used to characterize the market's regional behaviors for\nmarket participants.

In real-world applications, an object detector and tracker must\ninteract on a periodic basis to discover new objects, and thereby to initiate\ntracks. Periodic interactions with the detector can also allow the tracker to\nvalidate and/or update its object template with new bounding boxes. However,\nbounding boxes provided by a state-of-the-art detector are noisy, due to\nchanges in appearance, background and occlusion, which can cause the tracker to\ndrift. Moreover, CNN-based detectors can provide a high level of accuracy at\nthe expense of computational complexity, so interactions should be minimized\nfor real-time applications.\n  In this paper, a new approach is proposed to manage detector-tracker\ninteractions for trackers from the Siamese-FC family. By integrating a change\ndetection mechanism into a deep Siamese-FC tracker, its template can be adapted\nin response to changes in a target's appearance that lead to drifts during\ntracking. An abrupt change detection triggers an update of tracker template\nusing the bounding box produced by the detector, while in the case of a gradual\nchange, the detector is used to update an evolving set of templates for robust\nmatching.\n  Experiments were performed using state-of-the-art Siamese-FC trackers and the\nYOLOv3 detector on a subset of videos from the OTB-100 dataset that mimic video\nsurveillance scenarios. Results highlight the importance for reliable VOT of\nusing accurate detectors. They also indicate that our adaptive Siamese trackers\nare robust to noisy object detections, and can significantly improve the\nperformance of Siamese-FC tracking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 15:52:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-01"}

Under favorable environmental\nconditions flightless juveniles may aggregate into coherent, aligned swarms\nreferred to as hopper bands. These bands are often observed as a propagating\nwave having a dense front with rapidly decreasing density in the wake. A\ntantalizing and common observation is that these fronts slow and steepen in the\npresence of green vegetation. This suggests the collective motion of the band\nis mediated by resource consumption. Our goal is to model and quantify this\neffect. We focus on the Australian plague locust, for which excellent field and\nexperimental data is available. Exploiting the alignment of locusts in hopper\nbands, we concentrate solely on the density variation perpendicular to the\nfront. We develop two models in tandem; an agent-based model that tracks the\nposition of individuals and a partial differential equation model that\ndescribes locust density. In both these models, locust are either stationary\n(and feeding) or moving. Resources decrease with feeding. The rate at which\nlocusts transition between moving and stationary (and vice versa) is enhanced\n(diminished) by resource abundance. This effect proves essential to the\nformation, shape, and speed of locust hopper bands in our models. From the\nbiological literature we estimate ranges for the ten input parameters of our\nmodels. Sobol sensitivity analysis yields insight into how the band's\ncollective characteristics vary with changes in the input parameters. By\nexamining 4.4 million parameter combinations, we identify biologically\nconsistent parameters that reproduce field observations. We thus demonstrate\nthat resource-dependent behavior can explain the density distribution observed\nin locust hopper bands. This work suggests that feeding behaviors should be an\nintrinsic part of future modeling efforts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 15:53:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 22:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

As LOCC\nhas a highly intricate structure, sometimes the larger set of separable (SEP)\nmaps is considered, which has a mathematically much simpler description. In the\nliterature, mainly SEP maps consisting of invertible Kraus operators have been\ntaken into account. In this paper we show that the consideration of those maps\nis not sufficient when deciding whether a state can be mapped to another via\ngeneral SEP transformations. This is done by providing explicit examples of\ntransformations among pure 3- and 5- qubits states, which are feasible via SEP\nmaps containing singular Kraus operators, however, not possible via SEP maps\ncontaining solely regular Kraus operators. The key point that allows to\nconstruct the SEP maps is to introduce projective measurements that occur with\nprobability zero on the input state. The fact that it is not sufficient to\nconsider SEP maps composed out of regular Kraus operators even in the case of\npure state transformations, also affects the results on LOCC transformations\namong pure states. However, we show that non-invertible Kraus operators do not\nhelp in state transformations under LOCC with finitely many rounds of classical\ncommunication, i.e. the necessary and sufficient condition for SEP\ntransformations with invertible Kraus operators is still a necessary condition\nfor convertibility under finite-round LOCC.

A brane-localized kinetic\nterm is present in the DM brane, while in the fat brane it is not allowed. In\nthis model the kinetic mixing is not required because we assume that the SM\nparticles couple to the mediator through their $B-L$ charges, while DM couples\nto it via a dark charge.

Interpreting atmospheric\nspectra for the remote detection of volatile compounds requires information\nabout the spectrum of each relevant molecule. However, spectral data currently\nexist for a few hundred molecules and only a fraction of those have complete\nspectra (e.g. H$_2$O, NH$_3$). Consequently, molecular detections in\natmospheric spectra remain vulnerable to false positives, false negatives, and\nmissassignments. There is a key need for spectral data for a broad range of\nmolecules. Given how challenging it is to obtain high-resolution molecular\nspectra, there is great value in creating intermediate approximate spectra that\ncan provide a starting point for the analysis of atmospheric spectra.\n  Using a combination of experimental measurements, organic chemistry, and\nquantum mechanics, RASCALL (Rapid Approximate Spectral Calculations for ALL) is\na computational approach that provides approximate spectral data for any given\nmolecule, including thousands of potential atmospheric gases, in seconds.\nRASCALL 1.0 simulates molecular spectra by interpreting functional group data\nfrom experimental and theoretical sources to estimate the position and strength\nof molecular bands. The RASCALL 1.0 spectra consist of approximate band centers\nand qualitative intensities. RASCALL can also be used to study spectral\npatterns between molecules, and to highlight ambiguities in molecular\ndetections. The RASCALL catalogue, and its preliminary version RASCALL 1.0,\ncontains spectral data for more molecules than any other publicly available\ndatabase, with applications in all fields interested in the detection of\nmolecules in the gas phase.

Our approach is to use a generative\nmodel that produces 2-D images as projections of a latent 3D voxel grid, which\nwe train either as a variational auto-encoder or using adversarial methods. Our\ncontributions are as follows: First, we show how to recover 3D shape and pose\nfrom general datasets such as MNIST, and MNIST Fashion in good quality. Second,\nwe compare the shapes learned using adversarial and variational methods.\nAdversarial approach gives denser 3D shapes. Third, we explore the idea of\nmodelling the pose of an object as uniform distribution to recover 3D shape\nfrom a single image. Our experiment with the CelebA dataset\n\\cite{liu2015faceattributes} proves that we can recover complete 3D shape from\na single image when the object is symmetric along one, or more axis whilst\nresults obtained using ModelNet40 \\cite{wu20153d} show the potential\nside-effects, in which the model learns 3D shapes such that it can render the\nsame image from any viewpoint.

The recent report by Guesten et al (Nature, 568, 357, 2019) of\ndetection of HeH+ in planetary Nebula NGC 7027 confirms its presence, but it\ndoes not conclusively prove the origin of this species. To create molecules\nfrom free moving quasi-ions surrounded by an electronic cloud, the\nBorn-Oppenheimer-Huang (BOH) theory furnishes two kinds of forces, namely, one\nthat results from the Potential Energy Surfaces (PESs) and the other from\nNon-Adiabatic Coupling Terms (NACTs). Whereas the PESs are known to manage slow\nmoving quasi-ions the NACTs, with their, frequently, infinitely large values at\nthe vicinity of the singularities can control the fast moving quasi-ions. To\nachieve that the BOH equation indicates that the NACTs are affecting the fast\nmoving quasi-ions directly and if they are attributed with dissipative features\nor in other words to behave as a Friction Force they indeed could serve (like\nany other ordinary friction) as moderators for the fast atomic(ionic) species.\nIt is proposed in the present paper that the triatomic HeH2+ was the precursor\nto HeH+ and it could have been formed by the (He, H, H)+ nuclei coming together\nunder the electron cloud, facilitated by the NACTs between different electronic\nstates acting as an astronomical friction force. This is possible because of\nthe singularities in the NACTs for triatomic systems and NOT for diatomic\nsystems.
