Our approach, unlike previous work, needs no information about the\nquality of the surrogate gradients and is always guaranteed to find a descent\ndirection that is better than the surrogate gradient. This allows to\niteratively use the previous gradient estimate as surrogate gradient for the\ncurrent search point. We theoretically prove that this yields fast convergence\nto the true gradient for linear functions and show under simplifying\nassumptions that it significantly improves gradient estimates for general\nfunctions.

To make Re-ID systems more\npractical, methods have been proposed that achieve high performance without\ninformation of a target domain.

The second contribution of\nthis project is that an end-to-end DNN is constructed to have joint CNN and RNN\nblock and gives the estimation on valence and arousal for each frame in\nsequential data. VGGFace, ResNet, DenseNet with the corresponding pre-trained\nmodel for CNN block and LSTM, GRU, IndRNN, Attention mechanism for RNN block\nare experimented aiming to find the best combination. Fine tuning and transfer\nlearning techniques are also tried out. By comparing the CCC evaluation value\non test data, the best model is found to be pre-trained VGGFace connected with\n2 layers GRU with attention mechanism. The models test performance is 0.555 CCC\nfor valence with sequence length 80 and 0.499 CCC for arousal with sequence\nlength 70.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 17:24:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 22:42:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

The\nobserved low depolarization rate in WS2/Gr heterostructure is attributed to the\nnearly temperature independent scattering rate due to phonons and fast charge\nand energy transfer processes from WS2 to graphene.

However, the multiplicity\nof WD progenitors is generally neglected. Specifically, a merger in a binary\nsystem can lead to a single WD, which could result in wrongly inferred\nquantities if only single stellar evolution (SSE) is considered. These mergers\nare linked to transients such as luminous red novae and Type Ia supernovae.\nAims: We investigate the impact of binary evolution (BE) upon observable single\nWDs, and compare their properties to WDs formed through SSE. We assess the\nevolutionary channels and the age and mass distributions of the resulting\nsingle Wds. Methods: We employed \\texttt{SeBa} to model the evolution of single\nstar and binary populations. We synthesised the observable single WD population\nwithin $100$ pc, including cooling and observational selection effects.\nAdditionally, we constructed models with different evolution and primordial\npopulation properties to study the effects on the properties of the resulting\nsingle WDs.\n  Results: White dwarfs from binary mergers make up about $10-30\\%$ of all\nobservable single WDs and $30-50\\%$ of massive WDs. On average, individual WDs\ntake\n  $3.1-5$ times longer to form through BE than SE, and so appear ${\\sim} 1$ Gyr\nyounger than they are if BE is ignored. In all models, the effect of mergers on\nthe age distribution is clearly noticeable. The median age typically increases\nby $85-430$ Myr and $200-390$ Myr for massive WDs. Although abundant, we do not\nfind evidence that WDs from mergers significantly alter the shape of the WD\nmass distribution.

Due to the increasing memory intensity\nof most DNN workloads, main memory can dominate the system's energy consumption\nand stall time. One effective way to reduce the energy consumption and increase\nthe performance of DNN inference systems is by using approximate memory, which\noperates with reduced supply voltage and reduced access latency parameters that\nviolate standard specifications. Using approximate memory reduces reliability,\nleading to higher bit error rates. Fortunately, neural networks have an\nintrinsic capacity to tolerate increased bit errors. This can enable\nenergy-efficient and high-performance neural network inference using\napproximate DRAM devices.\n  Based on this observation, we propose EDEN, a general framework that reduces\nDNN energy consumption and DNN evaluation latency by using approximate DRAM\ndevices, while strictly meeting a user-specified target DNN accuracy. EDEN\nrelies on two key ideas: 1) retraining the DNN for a target approximate DRAM\ndevice to increase the DNN's error tolerance, and 2) efficient mapping of the\nerror tolerance of each individual DNN data type to a corresponding approximate\nDRAM partition in a way that meets the user-specified DNN accuracy\nrequirements.\n  We evaluate EDEN on multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and DNN accelerators with error\nmodels obtained from real approximate DRAM devices.

We present two complementary methods for measuring string\norder parameters that reveal the transition, and additionally analyse the\neffects of noise in the device using simple error models. The simulation that\nwe perform is easily scalable and is a practical demonstration of the utility\nof near-term quantum computers for the study of quantum phases of matter and\ntheir transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 18:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:10:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 10:37:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 11:09:59 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 19 May 2022 07:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-20"}

The\nunderlying probability density function (pdf) $f_X(x)$ does not usually have a\nclosed expression except for specific parameter values.

Recently, value function\nfactorization learning emerges as a promising way to address these challenges\nin collaborative multi-agent systems. However, existing methods have been\nfocusing on learning fully decentralized value functions, which are not\nefficient for tasks requiring communication. To address this limitation, this\npaper presents a novel framework for learning nearly decomposable Q-functions\n(NDQ) via communication minimization, with which agents act on their own most\nof the time but occasionally send messages to other agents in order for\neffective coordination. This framework hybridizes value function factorization\nlearning and communication learning by introducing two information-theoretic\nregularizers. These regularizers are maximizing mutual information between\nagents' action selection and communication messages while minimizing the\nentropy of messages between agents. We show how to optimize these regularizers\nin a way that is easily integrated with existing value function factorization\nmethods such as QMIX. Finally, we demonstrate that, on the StarCraft unit\nmicromanagement benchmark, our framework significantly outperforms baseline\nmethods and allows us to cut off more than $80\\%$ of communication without\nsacrificing the performance.

These restricted users are only allowed\nto interact with the quantum channel in a limited manner. Originally introduced\nto study the key-distribution problem, semi-quantum research has since\nexpanded, and continues to grow, with new protocols, security proof methods,\nexperimental implementations, and new cryptographic applications beyond key\ndistribution. Research in the field of semi-quantum cryptography requires new\ninsights into working with restricted protocols and, so, the tools and\ntechniques derived in this field can translate to results in broader quantum\ninformation science. Furthermore, other questions such as the connection\nbetween quantum and classical processing, including how classical information\nprocessing can be used to counteract a quantum deficiency in a protocol, can\nshed light on important theoretical questions.\n  This work surveys the history and current state-of-the-art in semi-quantum\nresearch. We discuss the model and several protocols offering the reader\ninsight into how protocols are constructed in this realm. We discuss security\nproof methods and how classical post-processing can be used to counteract\nusers' inability to perform certain quantum operations. Moving beyond key\ndistribution, we survey current work in other semi-quantum cryptographic\nprotocols and current trends. We also survey recent work done in attempting to\nconstruct practical semi-quantum systems including recent experimental results\nin this field. Finally, as this is still a growing field, we highlight,\nthroughout this survey, several open problems that we feel are important to\ninvestigate in the hopes that this will spur even more research in this topic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 18:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

A\ndetector selection problem is formulated to achieve this objective. However,\nsince the problem is high dimensional and NP-hard, we first decompose the\nproblem into smaller problems and train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network\nto obtain the solution. The MLP network is trained to select a low-complexity,\nyet reliable, detector using instantaneous channel condition in the RE. We\nfirst propose a method to generate a labeled dataset to select a low-complexity\ndetector. Then, the MLP is trained twice using quasi-Newton method to select a\nreliable detector for each RE. The performance of online detector selection is\nevaluated in 5G NR link level simulator in terms of BLER and the complexity is\nquantified in terms of the number of Euclidean distance (ED) computations and\nthe number of real additions and multiplication.

However, this\nsuccess is heavily dependent on the quality of the image that is being\nsegmented. A commonly neglected point in the medical image analysis community\nis the vast amount of clinical images that have severe image artefacts due to\norgan motion, movement of the patient and/or image acquisition related issues.\nIn this paper, we discuss the implications of image motion artefacts on cardiac\nMR segmentation and compare a variety of approaches for jointly correcting for\nartefacts and segmenting the cardiac cavity. The method is based on our\nrecently developed joint artefact detection and reconstruction method, which\nreconstructs high quality MR images from k-space using a joint loss function\nand essentially converts the artefact correction task to an under-sampled image\nreconstruction task by enforcing a data consistency term. In this paper, we\npropose to use a segmentation network coupled with this in an end-to-end\nframework. Our training optimises three different tasks: 1) image artefact\ndetection, 2) artefact correction and 3) image segmentation. We train the\nreconstruction network to automatically correct for motion-related artefacts\nusing synthetically corrupted cardiac MR k-space data and uncorrected\nreconstructed images. Using a test set of 500 2D+time cine MR acquisitions from\nthe UK Biobank data set, we achieve demonstrably good image quality and high\nsegmentation accuracy in the presence of synthetic motion artefacts.

While the dRL algorithm could in theory be directly applied\nto multi-shell data, it is not optimised to model the signal from multiple\ntissue types. In this work, we introduce a new framework based on dRL - dubbed\nGeneralized Richardson Lucy (GRL) - that uses multi-shell data in combination\nwith user-chosen tissue models to disentangle partial volume effects and\nincrease the accuracy in FOD estimation. The optimal weighting of multi-shell\ndata in the fit and the robustness to noise and partial volume effects of GRL\nwas studied with synthetic data.

The feasibility of including intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM)\neffects in the modelling was studied on a third dataset. Results of simulations\nshow that GRL can robustly disentangle different tissue types at SNR above 20\nand improves the angular accuracy of the FOD estimation.

This research develops automatic methods for detecting brain imaging\npreclinical biomarkers for Parkinson's disease (PD) by considering the novel\napplication of evolutionary algorithms. A fundamental novel element of this\nwork is the use of evolutionary algorithms to both map and predict the\nfunctional connectivity in patients using resting state functional MRI data\ntaken from the PPMI to identify PD progression biomarkers. Specifically,\nCartesian Genetic Programming was used to classify DCM data as well as\ntime-series data. The findings were validated using two other commonly used\nclassification methods (Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines)\nand by employing k-fold cross-validation. Across DCM and time-series analyses,\nfindings revealed maximum accuracies of 75.21% for early stage (prodromal) PD\npatients versus healthy controls, 85.87% for PD patients versus prodromal PD\npatients, and 92.09% for PD patients versus healthy controls. Prodromal PD\npatients were classified from healthy controls with high accuracy - this is\nnotable and represents the key finding of this research since current methods\nof diagnosing prodromal PD have both low reliability and low accuracy.\nFurthermore, Cartesian Genetic Programming provided comparable performance\naccuracy relative to ANN and SVM. Evolutionary algorithms enable us to decode\nthe classifier in terms of understanding the data inputs that are used, more\neasily than in ANN and SVM. Hence, these findings underscore the relevance of\nboth DCM analyses for classification and CGP as a novel classification tool for\nbrain imaging data with medical implications for disease diagnosis,\nparticularly in early and asymptomatic stages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 19:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

Sparse grids\nconstitute a discretization method that drastically eases the curse, while the\napproximation quality deteriorates only insignificantly. However, conventional\nbasis functions such as piecewise linear functions are not smooth (continuously\ndifferentiable).

Through this iterative process,\nthe measurement uncertainty model is more accurately characterized, which\nenables robust state estimation through the appropriate de-weighting of\nerroneous observations.

To explain this finding, we develop a method to\ncalculate the optimal regulation function that minimizes the timing noise. The\nmethod reveals that the combination of feedback and regulation minimizes noise\nby maximizing the number of molecular events that must happen in sequence\nbefore a threshold is crossed.

We report the number of\ncircumbinary planets (CBPs) and (BDs) that can be detected by LISA for various\ncombinations of mass and semi-major axis distributions. We identify pessimistic\nand optimistic scenarios corresponding, respectively, to 3 and 83 (14 and 2218)\ndetections of CBPs (BDs), observed during the length of the nominal LISA\nmission. These detections are distributed all over the Galaxy following the\nunderlying DWD distribution, and they are biased towards DWDs with higher LISA\nsignal-to-noise ratio and shorter orbital period. Finally, we show that if LISA\nwere to be extended for four more years, the number of systems detected will be\nmore than doubled in both the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios.

More specifically, 164,609 Lines of Code (LoC) and\n5,712 class files of six developing and 244,930 LoC and 12,048 class files of\nfive established open-source Java software are analyzed. Obtained results show\nthat out of the 4,020 occurrences of smells that were made for nine preselected\ntypes of design smells, 1,643 design smells were detected for developing\nsoftware, which mainly consisted of four specific types of smells. For\nestablished software, 2,397 design smells were observed which predominantly\nconsisted of four other types of smells. The remaining design smell was equally\nprevalent in both developing and established software. Desirable precision\nvalues ranging from 72.9% to 84.1% were obtained for the tool.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 22:11:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

The problem is considered in the\ncontext of a very stiff sphere adhering to a compliant, isotropic, linear\nelastic substrate, and experiencing adhesion and frictional slip relative to\neach other. The adhesion is considered to be driven by very large attractive\ntractions between the sphere and the substrate that can act only at very small\ndistances between them. As a consequence, the adhesion behavior can be\nrepresented by the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts model, and this is assumed to\nprevail also when frictional slip is occurring. Frictional slip is considered\nto be resisted by a uniform, constant shear traction at the slipping interface,\na model that is considered to be valid for small asperities and for compliant\nelastomers in contact with stiff material. A model for the interaction of\nfriction and adhesion, known to agree with some experimental data, is utilized.\nThis model is due to Johnson, and its adhesion-friction interaction is assumed\nto stem, upon shrinkage of the contact area, from a postulated reversible\nenergy release associated with frictional slip. This behavior is considered to\narise from surface microstructures generated or eliminated by frictional slip,\nwhere these microstructures store some elastic strain energy in a reversible\nmanner. The associated reversible energy release rate is derived from the\nenergy exchanges that occur in the system. The Johnson model, and an asymptotic\nanalysis of it for small amounts of frictional slip, is shown to be consistent\nwith the reversible energy release rate that we identify.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 2019 06:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

EDTI uses a\nnovel intrinsic reward, called Value of Interaction (VoI), to characterize and\nquantify the influence of one agent's behavior on expected returns of other\nagents.

There have been some works\nstudying optimization issues and approximation capabilities of neural ODEs, but\ntheir robustness is still yet unclear. In this work, we fill this important gap\nby exploring robustness properties of neural ODEs both empirically and\ntheoretically. We first present an empirical study on the robustness of the\nneural ODE-based networks (ODENets) by exposing them to inputs with various\ntypes of perturbations and subsequently investigating the changes of the\ncorresponding outputs. In contrast to conventional convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs), we find that the ODENets are more robust against both random\nGaussian perturbations and adversarial attack examples. We then provide an\ninsightful understanding of this phenomenon by exploiting a certain desirable\nproperty of the flow of a continuous-time ODE, namely that integral curves are\nnon-intersecting. Our work suggests that, due to their intrinsic robustness, it\nis promising to use neural ODEs as a basic block for building robust deep\nnetwork models. To further enhance the robustness of vanilla neural ODEs, we\npropose the time-invariant steady neural ODE (TisODE), which regularizes the\nflow on perturbed data via the time-invariant property and the imposition of a\nsteady-state constraint. We show that the TisODE method outperforms vanilla\nneural ODEs and also can work in conjunction with other state-of-the-art\narchitectural methods to build more robust deep networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 2019 07:15:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 03:33:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 03:28:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2022 11:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-04"}

In line with the\nheuristics, there are transitions at dimension $d=2$, and for a\ncorrelation-decay exponent $\\beta=2$; we capture the correct power of\nlogarithms coming from these two sources of criticality.\n  The decay of correlations is sharply encoded in terms of a multiscale\nlogarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) for the ensemble under consideration ---\nthe results would fail if correlation decay were encoded in terms of an\n$\\alpha$-mixing condition. Among other ensembles popular in modelling of random\nmedia, this class includes coefficient fields that are local transformations of\nstationary Gaussian fields.\n  The optimal growth of the corrector $\\phi$ is derived from bounding the size\nof spatial averages $F=\\int g\\cdot\\nabla\\phi $ of its gradient.

These trained\nmeta-weights are then used as initializers to the network in a test environment\nand fine-tuned for the last few fully connected layers. Variation in drone\ndynamics and environmental characteristics is carried out to show robustness of\nthe approach. Using NVIDIA GPU profiler it was shown that the energy\nconsumption and training latency is reduced by 3.7x and 1.8x respectively\nwithout significant degradation in the performance in terms of average distance\ntraveled before crash i.e. Mean Safe Flight (MSF). The approach is also tested\non a real environment using DJI Tello drone and similar results were reported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 2019 10:14:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

The two-branch neural network, consisting of\nstripe-based branch and attribute-aware branches, can adaptively extract the\ndiscriminative features from the visual appearance of vehicles. A horizontal\naverage pooling and dimension-reduced convolutional layers are inserted into\nthe stripe-based branch to achieve part-level features.

Finally, the part-level and global features\nare concatenated together to form the final descriptor of the input image for\nvehicle Re-ID. The final descriptor not only can separate vehicles with\ndifferent attributes but also distinguish vehicle identities with the same\nattributes.

By particle is understood an item localized in a very small\nvolume of the space, and which cannot be simultaneously in two disjoint regions\nof the space. By wave, to the contrary, is understood a distributed item,\noccupying in some cases two or more disjoint regions of the space. The quantum\nformalism did not explain until today the so called \"collapse\" of the wave\nfunction, i.e. the shrinking of the wave function to one small region of the\nspace, when a macroscopic object is encountered. This seems to happen in \"which\nway\" experiments. A very appealing explanation for this behavior is the idea of\na particle, localized in some limited part of the wave-function. The present\narticle challenges the concept of particle. It proves in base of a variant of\nthe Tan, Walls and Collett experiment, that this concept leads to a situation\nin which the particle has to be simultaneously in two places distant from one\nanother, situation that contradicts the very definition of a particle. Another\nargument is based on a modified version of the Afshar experiment, showing that\nthe concept of particle is problematic. The concept of particle makes\nadditional difficulties when the wave-function passes through fields. An\nunexpected possibility to solve these difficulties seems to arise from the\ncavity quantum electrodynamics studies done recently by S. Savasta and his\ncollaborators. It involves virtual particles. One of these studies is briefly\ndescribed here. Though, experimental results are expected, so that it is too\nsoon to draw conclusions whether it speaks in favor, or against the concept of\nparticle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 2019 11:39:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

This SLR aims at answering research\nquestions concerning: (i) the kind of meta-models proposed in literature; (ii)\nthe recurring constructs they contain; (iii) their purposes; and (iv) their\nevaluations. Thirty-six papers were selected and evaluated against four\nresearch questions. The results indicate the existence of a reasonable body of\nwork conducted in this specific area, but not a full maturity. In particular,\nwhile traditional paradigms towards business process modelling, and aspects\nrelated to the business process control flow seem to be well present, novel\nparadigms and aspects related to the organisational, data and goal-oriented\naspects of business processes seem to be still under-investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 2019 13:41:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 15:31:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-14"}

With this model we generate a diverse,\nrealistic, and physically plausible dataset of human action videos, called PHAV\nfor \"Procedural Human Action Videos\". PHAV contains a total of 39,982 videos,\nwith more than 1,000 examples for each of 35 action categories.

In addition,\neach video is represented with 6 different data modalities, including RGB,\noptical flow and pixel-level semantic labels. These modalities are generated\nalmost simultaneously using the Multiple Render Targets feature of modern GPUs.\nIn order to leverage PHAV, we introduce a deep multi-task (i.e. that considers\naction classes from multiple datasets) representation learning architecture\nthat is able to simultaneously learn from synthetic and real video datasets,\neven when their action categories differ. Our experiments on the UCF-101 and\nHMDB-51 benchmarks suggest that combining our large set of synthetic videos\nwith small real-world datasets can boost recognition performance.

Additional new\nmission configurations adapted with technological innovations could be\nenvisioned to pursue accurate measurements of these extremely small motions.\nThe goal of this white paper is to address the fundamental science questions\nthat are at stake when we focus on the motions of faint sky objects and to\nbriefly review quickly instrumentation and mission profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 2019 11:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-18"}

We propose a deep\nresidual neural network (ResNet) closure learning framework for ROMs of\nnonlinear systems. The novel ResNet-ROM framework consists of two steps: (i) In\nthe first step, we use ROM projection to filter the given nonlinear PDE and\nconstruct a filtered ROM. This filtered ROM is low-dimensional, but is not\nclosed (because of the PDE nonlinearity). (ii) In the second step, we use\nResNet to close the filtered ROM, i.e., to model the interaction between the\nresolved and unresolved ROM modes. We emphasize that in the new ResNet-ROM\nframework, data is used only to complement classical physical modeling (i.e.,\nonly in the closure modeling component), not to completely replace it. We also\nnote that the new ResNet-ROM is built on general ideas of spatial filtering and\ndeep learning and is independent of (restrictive) phenomenological arguments,\ne.g., of eddy viscosity type. The numerical experiments for the 1D Burgers\nequation show that the ResNet-ROM is significantly more accurate than the\nstandard projection ROM. The new ResNet-ROM is also more accurate and\nsignificantly more efficient than other modern ROM closure models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 2019 03:18:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-24"}

To automate the enumeration process, we develop a chromosome\nenumeration framework, DeepACEv2, based on the region based object detection\nscheme. The framework is developed following three steps. Firstly, we take the\nclassical ResNet-101 as the backbone and attach the Feature Pyramid Network\n(FPN) to the backbone. The FPN takes full advantage of the multiple level\nfeatures, and we only output the level of feature map that most of the\nchromosomes are assigned to. Secondly, we enhance the region proposal network's\nability by adding a newly proposed Hard Negative Anchors Sampling to extract\nunapparent but essential information about highly confusing partial\nchromosomes. Next, to alleviate serious occlusion problems, besides the\ntraditional detection branch, we novelly introduce an isolated Template Module\nbranch to extract unique embeddings of each proposal by utilizing the\nchromosome's geometric information. The embeddings are further incorporated\ninto the No Maximum Suppression (NMS) procedure to improve the detection of\noverlapping chromosomes. Finally, we design a Truncated Normalized Repulsion\nLoss and add it to the loss function to avoid inaccurate localization caused by\nocclusion. In the newly collected 1375 metaphase images that came from a\nclinical laboratory, a series of ablation studies validate the effectiveness of\neach proposed module. Combining them, the proposed DeepACEv2 outperforms all\nthe previous methods, yielding the Whole Correct Ratio(WCR)(%) with respect to\nimages as 71.39, and the Average Error Ratio(AER)(%) with respect to\nchromosomes as about 1.17.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 2019 13:36:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2020 07:05:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 23:12:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 12:30:57 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 12:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}
