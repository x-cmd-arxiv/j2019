Here we make three points. Firstly, as shown\nby studies on pristine YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ in Paschen et al. and Friedemann et al.,\nisothermal crossed-field and single-field Hall effect measurements are\nnecessary to ascertain the evolution of the Fermi surface across this QCP.\nBecause Schubert et al. did not carry out such measurements, their results on\nFe- and Ni-substituted YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ cannot be used to assess the validity of\nthe Kondo destruction picture neither for substituted nor for pristine\nYbRh$_2$Si$_2$. Secondly, when referring to the data of Friedemann et al. on\nthe isothermal crossover of YbRh$_2$Si$_2$, they did not recognize the\nimplications of the crossover width, quantified by the full width at half\nmaximum (FWHM), being linear in temperature, with zero offset, over about $1.5$\ndecades in temperature, from 30 mK to 1 K. Finally, in claiming deviations of\nHall crossover FWHM data of Friedemann et al. from the above linear-in-$T$\ndependence they neglected the error bars of these measurements and discarded\nsome of the data points. The claims of Schubert et al. are thus not supported\nby data, neither previously published nor new (Ref. 1).

Despite its chemical inertness, nitrogen\nmolecule is broken by lightning, hot volcanic vents, and bolide impacts, and\ncan be converted into soluble nitrogen compounds and then sequestered in the\nocean. The very stability of nitrogen, and that of nitrogen-based habitability,\nis thus called into question. Here we determine the lifetime of molecular\nnitrogen vis-a-vis aqueous sequestration, by developing a novel model that\ncouples atmospheric photochemistry and oceanic chemistry. We find that HNO, the\ndominant nitrogen compounds produced in anoxic atmospheres, is converted to N2O\nin the ocean, rather than oxidized to nitrites or nitrates as previously\nassumed. This N2O is then released back into the atmosphere and quickly\nconverted to N2. We also find that the deposition rate of NO is severely\nlimited by the kinetics of the aqueous-phase reaction that converts NO to\nnitrites in the ocean. Putting these insights together, we conclude that the\natmosphere must produce nitrogen species at least as oxidized as NO2 and HNO2\nto enable aqueous sequestration. The lifetime of molecular nitrogen in anoxic\natmospheres is determined to be >1 billion years on temperate planets of both\nSun-like and M dwarf stars.

Data\nare acquired in a rough-wall turbulent boundary layer that develops in a\nrecirculating wind tunnel set-up. Two source sizes in an elevated position are\nconsidered in order to investigate the influence of the emission conditions on\nthe plume dynamics. The analysis is focused on the effects of the meandering\nmotion and the relative dispersion. First, classical statistics are\ninvestigated. We found that (in accordance with previous studies) the\nmeandering motion is the main responsible for differences in the variance and\nintermittency, as well as the kurtosis and power spectral density, between the\ntwo source sizes. On the contrary, the mean and the skewness are slightly\naffected by the emission conditions. To characterize the temporal structure of\nthe turbulent transport series, the visibility algorithm is exploited to carry\nout a complex network-based analysis. Two network metrics -- the average peak\noccurrence and the assortativity coefficient -- are analysed, as they can\ncapture the temporal occurrence of extreme events and their relative intensity\nin the series. The effects of the meandering motion and the relative dispersion\nof the plume are discussed in the view of the network metrics, revealing that a\nstronger meandering motion is associated with higher values of both the average\npeak occurrence and the assortativity coefficient. The network-based analysis\nadvances the level of information of classical statistics, by characterizing\nthe impact of the emission conditions on the temporal structure of the signals\nin terms of extreme events and their relative intensity. In this way, complex\nnetworks provide -- through the evaluation of network metrics -- an effective\ntool for time-series analysis of experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 16:58:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-10"}

It has\nbeen established by a classical electromagnetic theory that in a\ntwo-dimensional material the quantized properties for the quadupole topological\ninsulator should satisfy a basic relation. Here we discover a new type of\nquadrupole topological insulator (dubbed type-II) that violates this relation\ndue to the breakdown of the correspondence that a Wannier band and an edge\nenergy spectrum close their gaps simultaneously. We find that, similar to the\npreviously discovered (referred to as type-I) quadrupole topological insulator,\nthe type-II hosts topologically protected corner states carrying fractional\ncorner charges. However, the edge polarizations only occur at a pair of\nboundaries in the type-II insulating phase, leading to the violation of the\nclassical constraint.

Our aim was to constrain the relative abundances of H$_2$D$^+$ and\nD$_3^+$ in the cold outer envelope of the hot core CRL 2136 IRS 1.

However, observational constraints of\nwinds in nearby dwarf galaxies are limited as outflows are transient,\nintrinsically low-surface brightness features, and, thus, difficult to detect.\nUsing deep Hapha observations, we search for winds in a sample of twelve nearby\ndwarfs (M_* ~ 10^7 - 10^9.3 Msun) which host on-going or recent starbursts. We\ndetect features which we classify as winds in 6 galaxies, fountain candidates\nin 5 galaxies, and diffuse ISM in 1 system.

The improper modelling leads to well-known discrepancies between\nobserved and predicted oscillation frequencies for stars with convective\nenvelopes. Recently, three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations of stellar\nenvelopes have been shown to facilitate a realistic depiction of superadiabatic\nconvection in 1D stellar models. The resulting structural changes of the\nboundary layers have been demonstrated to impact not only the predicted\noscillation spectra but evolution tracks as well. In this paper, we quantify\nthe consequences that the change in boundary conditions has for stellar\nparameter estimates of main-sequence stars. For this purpose, we investigate\ntwo benchmark stars, Alpha Centauri A and B, using Bayesian inference. We show\nthat the improved treatment of turbulent convection makes the obtained 1D\nstellar structures nearly insensitive to the mixing length parameter. By using\n3D simulations in 1D stellar models, we hence overcome the degeneracy between\nthe mixing length parameter and other stellar parameters. By lifting this\ndegeneracy, the inclusion of 3D simulations has the potential to yield more\nrobust parameter estimates. In this way, a more realistic depiction of\nsuperadiabatic convection has important implications for any field that relies\non stellar models, including the study of the chemical evolution of the Milky\nWay Galaxy and exoplanet research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 18:56:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 14:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

The\nshedding of the unstable vortex upstream of the beam imposed a time-dependent\ndrag force on the cantilevered beam resulting in flow-induced beam\noscillations. The oscillations of the flexible beam were classified into two\ndistinct regimes: a regime with a clear single vortex shedding from upstream of\nthe beam resulting in a sinusoidal beam oscillation pattern with the frequency\nof oscillation increasing monotonically with Weissenberg number, and a regime\nat high Weissenberg numbers characterized by 3D chaotic flow instabilities\nwhere the frequency of oscillations plateaued.

The first is the \\emph{anomalous dissipation}\nof the solution, which has been studied in many contexts. The second is what we\ncall the \\emph{anomalous work} done by the force, a phenomenon that has not\nbeen analyzed before. There are numerous examples of solutions exhibiting\n\\emph{anomalous work}, for which even a continuous energy profile does not rule\nout the anomalous dissipation, but only implies the balance of the strengths of\nthese two effects, which we confirm in explicit constructions.

The derivation of the model is based on a theory of\nthermodynamically compatible systems and on a model of nonlinear\nelastoplasticity combined with a two-phase compressible fluid flow model. The\ngoverning equations of the model include phase mass conservation laws, a total\nmomentum conservation law, an equation for the relative velocities of the\nphases, an equation for mixture distortion, and a balance equation for\nporosity. They form a hyperbolic system of conservation equations that satisfy\nthe fundamental laws of thermodynamics. Two types of phase interaction are\nintroduced in the model: phase pressure relaxation to a common value and\ninterfacial friction. Inelastic deformations also can be accounted for by\nsource terms in the equation for distortion. The thus formulated model can be\nused for studying general compressible fluid flows in a deformable\nelastoplastic porous medium, and for modeling wave propagation in a saturated\nporous medium. Governing equations for small-amplitude wave propagation in a\nuniform porous medium saturated with a single fluid are derived.

Our\naim is to produce a relatively simple technique that can provide real time\nindications or predictions that an active region will produce an eruption. We\nexpand on the theoretical work of \\citet{Pagano2019fp} that was able to\ndistinguish eruptive from non-eruptive active regions. From this we introduce a\nnew operational metric that uses a combination of observed line-of-sight\nmagnetograms, 3D data-driven simulations and the projection of the 3D\nsimulations forward in time. Results show that the new metric correctly\ndistinguishes active regions as eruptive when observable signatures of eruption\nhave been identified and as non-eruptive when there are no observable\nsignatures of eruption. After successfully distinguishing eruptive from\nnon-eruptive active regions we illustrate how this metric may be used in a\n\"real-time\" operational sense were three levels of warning are categorised.\nThese categories are: high risk (red), medium risk (amber) and low risk (green)\nof eruption. Through considering individual cases we find that the separation\ninto eruptive and non-eruptive active regions is more robust the longer the\ntime series of observed magnetograms used to simulate the build up of magnetic\nstress and free magnetic energy within the active region. Finally, we conclude\nthat this proof of concept study delivers promising results where the ability\nto categorise the risk of an eruption is a major achievement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 19:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

These properties can\nestablish novel password generation techniques that are neither feasible nor\npractical with the existing probabilistic and non-probabilistic approaches.\nBased on these properties, we introduce:(1) A general framework for conditional\npassword guessing that can generate passwords with arbitrary biases; and (2) an\nExpectation Maximization-inspired framework that can dynamically adapt the\nestimated password distribution to match the distribution of the attacked\npassword set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 20:07:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 2020 15:21:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2020 17:50:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

The light curve analysis reveals that EC\n21494-7018 is a sdB pulsator counting up to 20 frequencies associated with\nindependent g-modes. The seismic analysis singles out an optimal model solution\nin full agreement with independent measurements provided by spectroscopy\n(atmospheric parameters derived from model atmospheres) and astrometry\n(distance evaluated from Gaia DR2 trigonometric parallax). Several key\nparameters of the star are derived. Its mass (0.391 +/- 0.009 Msun) is\nsignificantly lower than the typical mass of sdB stars, and suggests that its\nprogenitor has not undergone the He-core flash, and therefore could originate\nfrom a massive (>2 Msun) red giant, an alternative channel for the formation of\nhot B subdwarfs. Other derived parameters include the H-rich envelope mass\n(0.0037 +/- 0.0010 Msun), radius (0.1694 +/- 0.0081 Rsun), and luminosity\n(8.2+/-1.1 Lsun). The optimal model fit has a double-layered He+H composition\nprofile, which we interpret as an incomplete but ongoing process of\ngravitational settling of helium at the bottom of a thick H-rich envelope.\nMoreover, the derived properties of the core indicate that EC 21494-7018 has\nburnt ~43% (in mass) of its central helium and possesses a relatively large\nmixed core (Mcore = 0.198 +/- 0.010 Msun), in line with trends already\nuncovered from other g-mode sdB pulsators analysed with asteroseismology.\nFinally, we obtain for the first time an estimate of the amount of oxygen (in\nmass; X(O)core = 0.16 -0.05 +0.13) produced at this stage of evolution by an\nhelium-burning core.

It is known that small external\nstimuli can drive 3D ZrTe$_5$ into different topological phases including Dirac\nsemimetal. In order to emphasize the effect of Zeeman splitting, we consider 3D\nZrTe$_5$ in a strong TI phase with a small band gap. With Zeeman splitting\ngreater than the band gap, the WFTB model suggests that a type-I nodal ring\nprotected by (glide) mirror symmetry is formed when the B field aligns with the\ncrystal $a$ or $b$ axes, and that a pair of type-I Weyl nodes are formed\notherwise, when conduction and valence bands touch. We show that a pair of Weyl\nnodes can disappear through formation of a nodal ring, rather than requiring\ntwo Weyl nodes with opposite chirality to come together. Interestingly, a\ntype-II nodal ring appears from crossings of the top two valence bands when the\nB field is applied along the $c$ axis. This nodal ring gaps out to form type-II\nWeyl nodes when the B field rotates in the $bc$ plane. Comparing the WFTB and\nlinearized $k \\cdot p$ model, we find inadequacy of the latter at some B field\ndirections. Further, using the WFTB model, we numerically compute the intrinsic\nanomalous Hall conductivity ${\\sigma_{ac}}$ induced by Berry curvature as a\nfunction of chemical potential and B field direction. We find that\n${\\sigma_{ac}}$ increases abruptly when the B field is tilted from the $a$ axis\nwithin the $ab$ plane.

We computed multiple relevant statistical measures of\ndeep-learning generated simulations, and conclude that our method accurately\nreproduces the 3-dimensional spatial distribution of matter down to non-linear\nscales: $k < 0.7$ h/Mpc. Finally, our method allows us to generate massive\nneutrino simulations 10,000 times faster than the traditional methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 21:04:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-11"}

However, it is currently unclear how to efficiently update\nthat policy using reinforcement learning as these approaches are inherently\noptimizing different objective functions. Previous works have used loss\nfunctions, which combine behavior cloning losses with reinforcement learning\nlosses to enable this update. However, the components of these loss functions\nare often set anecdotally, and their individual contributions are not well\nunderstood. In this work, we propose the Cycle-of-Learning (CoL) framework that\nuses an actor-critic architecture with a loss function that combines behavior\ncloning and 1-step Q-learning losses with an off-policy pre-training step from\nhuman demonstrations. This enables transition from behavior cloning to\nreinforcement learning without performance degradation and improves\nreinforcement learning in terms of overall performance and training time.\nAdditionally, we carefully study the composition of these combined losses and\ntheir impact on overall policy learning.

Our findings\nindicate that the collective neutrino oscillation may occur more commonly in\nCCSNe and suggest that the CCSN community needs to accommodate these\noscillations self-consistently in the modelling of CCSNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 22:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

No\nsignificant variations are found in the optical photometry data during the same\nperiod. This suggests that this MIR outburst is caused by recent replenishing\nor redistribution of dust, rather than intrinsic variations of the WD. SED\nmodeling of 0145+234 suggests that there was already a dust disk around the WD\nin the quiescent state, and both of the temperature and surface area of the\ndisk evolved rapidly since the outburst. The dust temperature was about 1770K\nin the initial rising phase, close to the sublimation temperature of silicate\ngrains, and gradually cooled down to around 1150K, while the surface area\nincreased by a factor of about 6 during the same period.

Some computational complexity of this form is\nunavoidable, as it is NP-hard for truthful mechanisms to guarantee even an\n$m^{1/2-\\varepsilon}$-approximation for any $\\varepsilon > 0$ [Dobzinski and\nVondr\\'ak, 2016].

Specifically, advice maps a tentative\nstrategy either to that same strategy itself, or one that dominates it.

Our major contributions are: Firstly, we present the MS-NOMA\nsignal and analyze the Bit Error Rate (BER) and ranging accuracy by deriving\ntheir simple expressions.

A natural question arises: can the symmetrized orders achieve\nfaster convergence rates than the cyclic order, or even getting close to the\nrandomized versions?

We prove local convergence of CRM in the same prototypical settings of\nmost theoretical analysis of regular nonconvex DR, whose consideration is made\nnatural by the geometry of the phase retrieval problem. For the purpose, we\nshow that CRM is related to the method of subgradient projections. For many\ncases when DR is known to converge to a feasible point, we establish that CRM\nlocally provides a better convergence rate. As a root finder, we show that CRM\nhas local convergence whenever Newton--Raphson method does, has quadratic rate\nwhenever Newton--Raphson method does, and exhibits superlinear convergence in\nmany cases when Newton--Raphson method fails to converge at all.

The first-order\ntransition without latent heat at TK2 = 122.4 K induces ordered Phase 3,\nbecomes underlying below Tg in further heating and induces an enthalpy excess\nat Tm which is used to predict TK2.

This paper introduces a novel\narchitecture to recognizing texts of arbitrary shapes, named Self-Attention\nText Recognition Network (SATRN), which is inspired by the Transformer. SATRN\nutilizes the self-attention mechanism to describe two-dimensional (2D) spatial\ndependencies of characters in a scene text image. Exploiting the full-graph\npropagation of self-attention, SATRN can recognize texts with arbitrary\narrangements and large inter-character spacing. As a result, SATRN outperforms\nexisting STR models by a large margin of 5.7 pp on average in \"irregular text\"\nbenchmarks.

In the ballistic and diffusive limits, the analytical\nsolutions prove that there is no thermal rectification. In the\nballistic-diffusive regime, the heat flux prefers to flow from the inner\nboundary to the outer boundary. Furthermore, as the characteristic length (the\ndistance between two circular boundaries) increases from tens of nanometers to\ntens of microns, the thermal rectification ratio enhances first and then fades\naway gradually.

We extend it to the process of setting the problem. Bob,\nthe problem setter, selects a problem-setting by the initial measurement.\nAlice, the problem solver, unitarily computes the corresponding solution and\nreads it by the final measurement. This simple extension creates a new\nperspective from which to see the quantum algorithm. First, it highlights the\nrelevance of time-symmetric quantum mechanics to quantum computation: the\nproblem-setting and problem solution, in their quantum version, constitute pre-\nand post-selection, hence the process as a whole is bound to be affected by\nboth boundary conditions. Second, it forces us to enter into relational quantum\nmechanics. There must be a representation of the quantum algorithm with respect\nto Bob, and another one with respect to Alice, from whom the outcome of the\ninitial measurement, specifying the setting and thus the solution of the\nproblem, must be concealed. Time-symmetrizing the quantum algorithm to take\ninto account both boundary conditions leaves the representation to Bob\nunaltered.

Also astrochemistry enjoyed the possibility to analyze complex\nspectra obtained using large bandwidths: several interstellar Complex Organic\nMolecules (iCOMs; C-bearing species with at least 6 atoms) have been imaged\naround protostars.

The oscillations extend over several frequency bands. Between\ntheir dominant components, various couplings can be observed. Of these,\nPhase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) is intensively studied in relation to brain\nfunction. In the time-frequency domain, however, PAC measurement faces a\ndilemma in the choice of filter bandwidth. For a frequency m modulating a\nfrequency n, filters narrowly tuned around the latter frequency will miss the\nmodulatory components at frequencies n+m and n-m; wide band tuning will pass\nincreasing levels of noise. New Method: Our CFC measurement uses three\nidentical narrow band filters with center frequencies located on n-m, n, and\nn+m. The method therefore is free from the bandwidth dilemma. Comparison with\nExisting Method(s): The method was tested on diagnostic artificial signals\nmodeled on local field potentials and compared with four established PAC\ndetection algorithms. While the proposed method detected the simulated PAC in\nhigh frequency resolution, the other methods detected with poor frequency\nresolution, or completely missed the PAC.

A numerical study is performed with the vectorized\nversion of the discrete dipole approximation with surface interactions\n(DDA-SI-v). Gold (Au) and silver (Ag) metallic components are used for the\nsimulations of two different core-shell structures. Absorption enhancement and\nthe hybrid modes of plasmon resonances of the core-shell structures are\ncompared by using a measure that defines a size configuration. It is observed\nthat a small volume fraction of the core sizes results in shell domination over\nthe plasmon response. An additional study is conducted to discern the\nsensitivity of the refractive index of nanoparticles in different surrounding\nenvironments. With a selected core-shell size configuration of Ag-Au pairs, a\nsignificant absorption enhancement with a redshift of LSPR wavelength is\nobserved for both Ag core-Au shell and Au core-Ag shell NPs. The absorption\nbehavior of the bare metallic NPs and selected core-shell pairs in proximity to\nan external probe is also analyzed. The gallium phosphide (GaP) and silicon\n(Si) AFM tip usage are investigated with transverse electric (TE) and\ntransverse magnetic (TM) wave polarizations. It is observed that the dominance\nof light polarization on the absorption enhancement of the NPs switches at\ndifferent wavelengths, where the dielectric transition for tip materials\noccurs.

We also propose a new optimization method that\nretains gradient information and trains the model partially for end-to-end\nlearning with limited GPU memory capacity.

Despite their popularity, these models are not suitable to handle\nlifetime data with crossing survival curves. In 2005, Yang and Prentice\nproposed a semiparametric two-sample strategy (YP model), including the PH and\nPO frameworks as particular cases, to deal with this type of data. Assuming a\ngeneral regression setting, the present paper proposes an unified approach to\nfit the YP model by employing Bernstein polynomials to manage the baseline\nhazard and odds under both the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. The use of\nthe Bernstein polynomials has some advantages: it allows for uniform\napproximation of the baseline distribution, it leads to closed-form expressions\nfor all baseline functions, it simplifies the inference procedure, and the\npresence of a continuous survival function allows a more accurate estimation of\nthe crossing survival time. Extensive simulation studies are carried out to\nevaluate the behavior of the models. The analysis of a clinical trial data set,\nrelated to non-small-cell lung cancer, is also developed as an illustration.\nOur findings indicate that assuming the usual PH model, ignoring the existing\ncrossing survival feature in the real data, is a serious mistake with\nimplications for those patients in the initial stage of treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 10:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-11"}

Furthermore, the Event-Shape Engineering\ntechnique is used to measure D-meson elliptic flow in order to study the\ncoupling of the charm quarks to the light quarks of the underlying medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 12:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-11"}

This is\nusually achieved by two modules: behavior planner, which handles high-level\ndecisions and produces a coarse trajectory, and trajectory planner that\ngenerates a smooth, feasible trajectory for the duration of the planning\nhorizon. These planners, however, are typically developed separately, and\nchanges in the behavior planner might affect the trajectory planner in\nunexpected ways.

A central challenge for applying MICE is\ndetermining how to incorporate outcome information into covariate imputation\nmodels, particularly for complicated outcomes. Often, we have a particular\nanalysis model in mind, and we would like to ensure congeniality between the\nimputation and analysis models.\n  We propose a novel strategy for directly incorporating the analysis model\ninto the handling of missing data. In our proposed approach, multiple\nimputations of missing covariates are obtained without using outcome\ninformation. We then utilize the strategy of imputation stacking, where\nmultiple imputations are stacked on top of each other to create a large\ndataset. The analysis model is then incorporated through weights. Instead of\napplying multiple imputation combining rules, we obtain parameter estimates by\nfitting a weighted version of the analysis model on the stacked dataset. We\npropose a novel estimator for obtaining standard errors for this stacked and\nweighted analysis. Our estimator is based on the observed data information\nprinciple in Louis (1982) and can be applied for analyzing stacked multiple\nimputations more generally. Our approach for analyzing stacked multiple\nimputations is the first well-motivated method that can be easily applied for a\nwide variety of standard analysis models and missing data settings.\n  In simulations, the proposed strategy produced unbiased parameter estimates\nwhen the analysis model was correctly specified.

We give several equivalent\ncharacterizations of EB supermaps and superchannels.

We also demonstrate that many EB\nsuperchannels can be superactivated, in the sense that they can output\nnon-separable channels when wired in series.

We\nanalyze PdBI observations at 1.3 and 3.2 mm for 12 Class 0 protostars obtained\nas part of the CALYPSO survey and derive dust emissivity index (beta) profiles\nas a function of the envelope radius at 200-2000 au scales. Most of the\nprotostellar envelopes show low dust emissivity indices decreasing toward the\ncentral regions. The decreasing trend remains after correction of the\n(potentially optically-thick) central region emission, with surprisingly low\nbeta (lower than 1) values across most of the envelope radii of NGC1333-IRAS4A,\nNGC1333-IRAS4B, SVS13B, and Serpens-SMM4. We discuss the various processes that\ncould explain such low and varying dust emissivity indices at envelope radii\n200-2000 au. Our observations of extremely low dust emissivity indices could\ntrace the presence of large (mm-size) grains in Class 0 envelopes and a radial\nincrease of the dust grain size toward the inner envelope regions. While it is\nexpected that large grains in young protostellar envelopes could be built via\ngrain growth and coagulation, we stress that the typical timescales required to\nbuild mm grains in current coagulation models are at odds with the youth of our\nClass 0 protostars. Additional variations in the dust composition could also\npartly contribute to the low beta we observe. The steepness of the beta radial\ngradient depends strongly on the envelope mass, which might favor a scenario\nwhere large grains are built in high density protostellar disks and transported\nto the intermediate envelope radii, for example with the help of outflows and\nwinds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 15:34:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 12:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

Finally, we study the time-evolution of the half-filled HCB chain where\nthe particles are localized in the central part of the chain. We observe that\nthe particles spread linearly in a light-cone like region at the rate\ndetermined by the maximum value of the group velocity. Except for a very\ntrivial case, the maximum group velocity never vanishes, and therefore we do\nnot observe any dynamical localization in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 07:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Therefore, only\nfrom the acquired observations should state vectors reconstructed to emulate\nthe different states of the underlying system. It is what is known as the\nreconstruction of the state space, called phase space in real-world signals,\nfor now only satisfactorily resolved using the method of delays. Each state\nvector consists of m components, extracted from successive observations delayed\na time t. The morphology of the geometric structure described by the state\nvectors, as well as their properties, depends on the chosen parameters t and m.\nThe real dynamics of the system under study is subject to the correct\ndetermination of the parameters t and m. Only in this way can be deduced\ncharacteristics with true physical meaning, revealing aspects that reliably\nidentify the dynamic complexity of the physiological system. The biological\nsignal presented in this work, as a case study, is the PhotoPlethysmoGraphic\n(PPG) signal. We find that m is five for all the subjects analyzed and that t\ndepends on the time interval in which it evaluates. The H\\'enon map and the\nLorenz flow are used to facilitate a more intuitive understanding of applied\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 11:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-13"}
