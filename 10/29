We will find it is more perceptive alternative to\nuse affine connections more general than metric compatible connections in\nquantum gravity. We will demonstrate this using the canonical quantization\nprocedure. This is valid irrespective of the presence and nature of sources.\nThe conventional Palatini and metric-affine formalisms, where the actions are\nlinear in the scalar curvature with metric and affine connections being the the\nindependent variables, are not much suitable to construct a source-free theory\nof gravity with general affine connections. This is also valid for many\nminimally coupled interacting theories where sources only couple with metric by\nusing the Levi-Civita connections exclusively. We will discuss potential\nformalism of affine connections to introduce affine connections more general\nthan metric compatible connections in gravity. We will also discuss possible\nextensions of the actions for this purpose. General affine connections\nintroduce new fields in gravity besides metric. In this article, we will\nconsider a simple potential formalism with symmetric affine connections and\nsymmetric Ricci tensor. Corresponding affine connections introduce two massless\nscalar fields. One of these fields contributes a stress-tensor with opposite\nsign to the sources of Einstein's equation when we state the equation using the\nLevi-Civita connections. This means we have a massless scalar field with\nnegative stress-tensor in Einstein's equation. This field brings us beyond\nstrict local Minkowski geometries. These scalar fields can be useful to explain\ninflation and dark energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 16:23:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 May 2022 14:39:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 20:09:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 17:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}

For example, consider a recommendation system where users tend to only\nreveal ratings for items they like. In this case, a matrix completion method\nthat relies on entries being revealed at uniformly sampled row and column\nindices can yield overly optimistic predictions of unseen user ratings.\nRecently, various papers have shown that we can reduce this bias in MNAR matrix\ncompletion if we know the probabilities of different matrix entries being\nmissing. These probabilities are typically modeled using logistic regression or\nnaive Bayes, which make strong assumptions and lack guarantees on the accuracy\nof the estimated probabilities. In this paper, we suggest a simple approach to\nestimating these probabilities that avoids these shortcomings. Our approach\nfollows from the observation that missingness patterns in real data often\nexhibit low nuclear norm structure. We can then estimate the missingness\nprobabilities by feeding the (always fully-observed) binary matrix specifying\nwhich entries are revealed or missing to an existing nuclear-norm-constrained\nmatrix completion algorithm by Davenport et al. [2014]. Thus, we tackle MNAR\nmatrix completion by solving a different matrix completion problem first that\nrecovers missingness probabilities. We establish finite-sample error bounds for\nhow accurate these probability estimates are and how well these estimates\ndebias standard matrix completion losses for the original matrix to be\ncompleted. Our experiments show that the proposed debiasing strategy can\nimprove a variety of existing matrix completion algorithms, and achieves\ndownstream matrix completion accuracy at least as good as logistic regression\nand naive Bayes debiasing baselines that require additional auxiliary\ninformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 16:01:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 12:25:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

Contrary\nto most microscopy techniques, which detect a weak photon flux resulting from\nlight matter interactions, SRS is a pump-probe scheme that works in the high\nflux regime and happens as a weak modulation ($10^{-4}-10^{-6}$) in a strong\nlaser field. As a result, laser noise is a key issue in SRS detection. This\npractical tutorial provides the experimentalists with the tools required to\nassess the amount of noise and the ultimate SRS detection limit in a\nconventional lock-in-based SRS system. We first define the quantities that are\nrelevant when discussing intensity noise, and illustrate them through a\nconventional model of light detection by a photodiode. Stimulated Raman\nScattering is then introduced in its lock-in-based implementation, and the\nmodel presented is adapted in this particular case. The power spectral density\n(PSD), relative intensity noise (RIN), signal to noise ratio (SNR), and\nsensitivity of the system are derived and discussed. Two complementary methods\nare presented that allow measurement of the RIN and assessment of the\nperformance of a SRS system. Such measurements are illustrated on two\ncommercial laser systems. Finally, the consequences of noise in SRS are\ndiscussed, and future developments are suggested.

The amplitude of the\nbrightening suggests that this is a dwarf nova (DN) eruption in a CN system.\nVery few CNe have had DN eruptions within decades of the main CN outburst. The\n14 years separating the CN and DN eruptions of V1047 Cen is the shortest of all\ninstances recorded thus far. Explaining this rapid succession of CN and DN\noutbursts in V1047 Cen may be challenging within the framework of standard\ntheories for DN outbursts. Following a CN eruption, the mass accretion rate is\nbelieved to remain high $(\\dot{M}\\sim10^{-8}$M$_\\odot$yr$^{-1})$ for a few\ncenturies, due to the irradiation of the secondary star by the still-hot\nsurface of the white dwarf. Thus a DN eruption is not expected to occur during\nthis high mass accretion phase as DN outbursts, which result from thermal\ninstabilities in the accretion disk, and arise during a regime of low mass\naccretion rate $(\\dot{M}\\sim10^{-10}$M$_\\odot$yr$^{-1})$. Here we present\nnear-infrared spectroscopy to show that the present outburst is most likely a\nDN eruption, and discuss the possible reasons for its early occurrence. Even if\nthe present re-brightening is later shown to be due to a cause other than a DN\noutburst, the present study provides invaluable documentation of this unusual\nevent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 16:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

First,\nselection techniques often need a condition to terminate the reduction process,\nfor example, by using a threshold or the number of features to stop, and\nsearching an adequate stopping condition is highly challenging. Second, it is\nuncertain that the reduced variable set would work well; our preliminary\nexperimental result shows that well-known selection techniques produce\ndifferent sets of variables as a result of reduction (even with the same\ntermination condition), and it is hard to estimate which of them would work the\nbest in future testing.

However, wide-scale adoption of these\nmethods in real-world domains is made difficult by their poor sample\nefficiency. We address this problem both theoretically and empirically. On the\ntheoretical side, we identify two phenomena preventing efficient exploration in\nexisting state-of-the-art algorithms such as Soft Actor Critic. First,\ncombining a greedy actor update with a pessimistic estimate of the critic leads\nto the avoidance of actions that the agent does not know about, a phenomenon we\ncall pessimistic underexploration. Second, current algorithms are directionally\nuninformed, sampling actions with equal probability in opposite directions from\nthe current mean. This is wasteful, since we typically need actions taken along\ncertain directions much more than others. To address both of these phenomena,\nwe introduce a new algorithm, Optimistic Actor Critic, which approximates a\nlower and upper confidence bound on the state-action value function. This\nallows us to apply the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty to\nperform directed exploration using the upper bound while still using the lower\nbound to avoid overestimation.

Our main\ncontribution will be a consequence of the following result: there exists a\n$C^{\\infty}$ hypersurface $S$ without characteristic points that has\nuncountably many pairwise non-isomorphic tangent groups on every\npositive-measure subset. The example is found in a Carnot group of topological\ndimension 8, it has Hausdorff dimension 12 and so we use on it the Hausdorff\nmeasure $\\mathcal{H}^{12}$.

To this end, we consider the following distributed\ndata summarizataion problem. Given K private source datasets denoted by\n$[D_i]_{i\\in [K]}$ and a small target validation set $D_v$, which may involve a\nconsiderable covariate shift with respect to the sources, compute a summary\ndataset $D_s\\subseteq \\bigcup_{i\\in [K]} D_i$ such that its statistical\ndistance from the validation dataset $D_v$ is minimized.

Robust predictions from stellar models are\nneeded to interpret these. Theory predicts the existence of a gap in the BH\nmass distribution because of pair-instability supernova. The maximum BH mass\nbelow the gap is the result of pulsational mass loss. We evolve massive helium\nstars through their late hydrodynamical phases of evolution using the\nopen-source MESA stellar evolution code. We find that the location of the lower\nedge of the mass gap at 45$M_\\odot$ is remarkably robust against variations in\nthe metallicity ($\\approx 3M_\\odot$), the treatment of internal mixing\n($\\approx 1M_\\odot$), stellar wind mass loss ($\\approx 4M_\\odot$), making it\nthe most robust predictions for the final stages of massive star evolution.

The strength of a WR wind decides the\neventual mass of its remnant, likely a massive black hole. However, despite\ntheir major influence and importance for gravitational wave detection\nstatistics, WR winds are particularly poorly understood. In this paper, we\nintroduce the first set of hydrodynamically consistent stellar atmosphere\nmodels for classical WR stars of both the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sequence,\ni.e. WC and WN stars, as a function of stellar luminosity-to-mass ratio (or\nEddington Gamma), and metallicity.

For $\\log Z/Z_\\odot >\n-2$, Fe is also the main accelerator throughout the wind. Contrasting previous\nclaims of a sharp lower mass-loss limit for WR stars, we obtain a smooth\ntransition to optically thin winds. Furthermore, we find a strong dependence of\nthe mass-loss rates on Eddington-$\\Gamma$, both at solar and sub-solar\nmetallicity. Increases in WC carbon and oxygen abundances turn out to slightly\nreduce the predicted mass-loss rates. Calculations at subsolar metallicities\nindicate that below the metallicity of the SMC, WR mass-loss rates decrease\nmuch faster than previously assumed, potentially allowing for high black hole\nmasses even in the local universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 18:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-07"}

So far the theory of migration has focused on\nthe interaction of planets with an inviscid or viscously evolving disk.\nTurbulent viscosity is thought to be the main driver of disk evolution and is\nknown to affect the migration process. Recently, the topic of wind-driven\naccretion is experiencing a renaissance, as evidence is mounting that PPDs may\nbe less turbulent than previously thought, and 3-D non-ideal MHD modeling of\nthe wind-launching process is maturing. Aim: We wish to investigate how\nwind-driven accretion may affect migration. We aim for a qualitative\nexploration of the main effects, rather than a quantitative prediction.\nMethods: We perform 2-D hydrodynamic simulations with the FARGO3D code in the\n$(r,\\phi)$-plane. The vertical coordinate and the launching of the wind are not\ntreated explicitly. Instead, the torque of the wind onto the disk is treated\nusing a simple 2-parameter formula treating the wind mass loss rate and the\nlever arm. Results: We find that the wind-driven accretion process has a\ndifferent way of replenishing the co-orbital region than the viscous accretion.\nThe former always injects mass from the outer edge of the co-orbital region and\nremoves mass from the inner edge, while the latter injects or removes mass from\nthe co-orbital region depending on the radial density gradients in the disk.\nThe migration behavior can differ very much and under certain conditions it can\ndrive rapid type-III-like outward migration. We derive an analytic expression\nfor the parameters under which this outward migration occurs. Conclusion: If\nwind-driven accretion plays a role in the secular evolution of PPDs, migration\nstudies have to include this process as well, because it can strongly affect\nthe resulting migration rate and direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 18:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-25"}

Random\nforest machine learning models in the validated MySurgeryRisk platform made\npatient-level predictions for three postoperative complications and mortality\nduring hospital admission using electronic health record data and patient\nneighborhood characteristics. For each outcome, one model trained with\npreoperative data alone and one model trained with both preoperative and\nintraoperative data. Models were compared by accuracy, discrimination\n(expressed as AUROC), precision (expressed as AUPRC), and reclassification\nindices (NRI). Machine learning models incorporating both preoperative and\nintraoperative data had greater accuracy, discrimination, and precision than\nmodels using preoperative data alone for predicting all three postoperative\ncomplications (intensive care unit length of stay >48 hours, mechanical\nventilation >48 hours, and neurological complications including delirium) and\nin-hospital mortality (accuracy: 88% vs. 77%, AUROC: 0.93 vs. 0.87, AUPRC: 0.21\nvs. 0.15). Overall reclassification improvement was 2.9-10.0% for complications\nand 11.2% for in-hospital mortality. Incorporating both preoperative and\nintraoperative data significantly increased accuracy, discrimination, and\nprecision for machine learning models predicting postoperative complications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 18:02:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 2019 16:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

Watermarking was recently proposed to protect the intellectual\nproperty of DNN classifiers. However, watermarking suffers from a key\nlimitation: it sacrifices the utility/accuracy of the model owner's classifier\nbecause it tampers the classifier's training or fine-tuning process. In this\nwork, we propose IPGuard, the first method to protect intellectual property of\nDNN classifiers that provably incurs no accuracy loss for the classifiers. Our\nkey observation is that a DNN classifier can be uniquely represented by its\nclassification boundary. Based on this observation, IPGuard extracts some data\npoints near the classification boundary of the model owner's classifier and\nuses them to fingerprint the classifier. A DNN classifier is said to be a\npirated version of the model owner's classifier if they predict the same labels\nfor most fingerprinting data points. IPGuard is qualitatively different from\nwatermarking. Specifically, IPGuard extracts fingerprinting data points near\nthe classification boundary of a classifier that is already trained, while\nwatermarking embeds watermarks into a classifier during its training or\nfine-tuning process.

A promising approach to prevent an agent's\npolicy from overfitting to a limited set of training environments is to apply\nregularization techniques originally developed for supervised learning.\nHowever, there are stark differences between supervised learning and RL. We\ndiscuss those differences and propose modifications to existing regularization\ntechniques in order to better adapt them to RL. In particular, we focus on\nregularization techniques relying on the injection of noise into the learned\nfunction, a family that includes some of the most widely used approaches such\nas Dropout and Batch Normalization. To adapt them to RL, we propose Selective\nNoise Injection (SNI), which maintains the regularizing effect the injected\nnoise has, while mitigating the adverse effects it has on the gradient quality.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the Information Bottleneck (IB) is a\nparticularly well suited regularization technique for RL as it is effective in\nthe low-data regime encountered early on in training RL agents. Combining the\nIB with SNI, we significantly outperform current state of the art results,\nincluding on the recently proposed generalization benchmark Coinrun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 18:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

However, extending GCNs to hyperbolic geometry\npresents several unique challenges because it is not clear how to define neural\nnetwork operations, such as feature transformation and aggregation, in\nhyperbolic space. Furthermore, since input features are often Euclidean, it is\nunclear how to transform the features into hyperbolic embeddings with the right\namount of curvature. Here we propose Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (HGCN), the first inductive hyperbolic GCN that leverages both the\nexpressiveness of GCNs and hyperbolic geometry to learn inductive node\nrepresentations for hierarchical and scale-free graphs.

Due to the non-Markovian nature of the dynamics,\nthe heat dissipation and the entropy production rate cannot be computed using\nthe standard methods for Markovian processes. In this work, to calculate heat\ndissipation, we use an effective Markov description of the non-Markovian\ndynamics, which includes the degrees-of-freedom of the medium. Specifically, we\ncalculate entropy production and heat dissipation rate for a spherical colloid\nin a non-Newtonian medium whose rheology is given by a Maxwell viscoelastic\nelement in parallel with a viscous fluid element, connected to different\ntemperature baths. This problem is nonequilibrium for two reasons: the medium\nis nonequilibrium due to different effective temperatures of the bath, and the\nparticle is driven out-of-equilibrium by an external stochastic force. When the\nmedium is nonequilibrium, the effective non-Markov dynamics of the particle may\nlead to a negative value of heat dissipation and entropy production rate. The\npositivity is restored when the medium's degree-of-freedom is considered. When\nthe medium is at equilibrium, and the only nonequilibrium component is the\nexternal driving, the correct dissipation is obtained from the effective\ndescription of the particle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 19:50:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 18:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

In\noptomechanics, the bi-directional conversion between electromagnetic waves or\nphotons at optical frequencies and elastic waves or phonons at radio\nfrequencies is building on precisely this fundamental principle. Surface\nacoustic waves provide a versatile interconnect on a chip and, thus, enable the\noptomechanical control of remote systems. Here, we report on the coherent\nnonlinear three-wave mixing between the coherent fields of two radio frequency\nsurface acoustic waves and optical laser photons via the dipole transition of a\nsingle quantum dot exciton. In the resolved sideband regime, we demonstrate\nfundamental acoustic analogues of sum and difference frequency generation\nbetween the two SAWs and employ phase matching to deterministically enhance or\nsuppress individual sidebands. This bi-directional transfer between the\nacoustic and optical domains is described by theory which fully takes into\naccount direct and virtual multi-phonon processes. Finally, we show that the\nprecision of the wave mixing is limited by the frequency accuracy of modern\nradio frequency electronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 20:14:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 19:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

The goal of the BTS is to spectroscopically classify all extragalactic\ntransients brighter than 18.5 mag at peak brightness and immediately announce\nthose classifications to the public.

Based on this data we perform an analysis of\nthe redshift completeness of local galaxy catalogs, dubbed as the Redshift\nCompleteness Fraction (RCF; the number of SN host galaxies with known\nspectroscopic redshift prior to SN discovery divided by the total number of SN\nhosts). In total, we identify the host galaxies of 512 Type Ia supernovae, 227\nof which have known spectroscopic redshifts, yielding an RCF estimate of $44\\%\n\\pm1\\%$.

With the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry,\nwe find that the chiral effective models reproducing the observed physical\nquantities suggest that the sigma0 meson regarded as the quantum fluctuation of\nthe chiral condensate should have a mass smaller than an order of 800 MeV when\nthe anomaly driven symmetry breaking takes place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 21:57:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 00:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

The population ratios and spatial distribution\nof Neptune's resonant populations are direct clues to understanding the history\nof our planetary system. The orbital structure of the objects in Neptune's 2:1\nmean-motion resonance (\\emph{twotinos}) has the potential to be a tracer of\nplanetary migration processes. Different migration processes produce distinct\narchitectures, recognizable by well-characterized surveys. However, previous\ncharacterized surveys only discovered a few twotinos, making it impossible to\nmodel the intrinsic twotino population. With a well-designed cadence and nearly\n100\\% tracking success, the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS)\ndiscovered 838 trans-Neptunian objects, of which 34 are securely twotinos with\nwell-constrained libration angles and amplitudes. We use the OSSOS twotinos and\nthe survey characterization parameters via the OSSOS Survey Simulator to\ninspect the intrinsic population and orbital distributions of twotino. The\nestimated twotino population, 4400$^{+1500}_{-1100}$ with $H_r<8.66$\n(diameter$\\sim$100km) at 95\\% confidence, is consistent with the previous\nlow-precision estimate.

Current practice on large-scale GAN\ntraining utilizes large models and distributed large-batch training strategies,\nand is implemented on deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch,\netc.) designed in a centralized manner. In the centralized network topology,\nevery worker needs to either directly communicate with the central node or\nindirectly communicate with all other workers in every iteration. However, when\nthe network bandwidth is low or network latency is high, the performance would\nbe significantly degraded. Despite recent progress on decentralized algorithms\nfor training deep neural networks, it remains unclear whether it is possible to\ntrain GANs in a decentralized manner. The main difficulty lies at handling the\nnonconvex-nonconcave min-max optimization and the decentralized communication\nsimultaneously.

Therefore, the output of\nthe mechanism is not fully informative of the data of the individuals in the\ndataset. We prove several guarantees for noiselessly-private mechanisms. The\ninformation content of the output about the data of an individual, even if an\nadversary knows all the other entries of the private dataset, is bounded by the\nprivacy budget. The zero-error capacity of memory-less channels using\nnoiselessly private mechanisms for transmission is upper bounded by the privacy\nbudget.

We proved\nthat the drastic decrease of the mobility and spin lifetime in the Si channel\nis due to the optical phonon emission at the high electric bias current, which\nconsequently reduced the spin accumulation voltage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 03:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

The vibrational wavepacket\nis created by 40% of the excited population that undergoes electron transfer\nfrom the non-equilibrium MLCT excited state to the 3MC excited state with a 110\nfs time constant, while the other 60% relaxes to a 3MLCT excited state in\nparallel.

In\nour previous work, we have demonstrated that GDS projection works as the\nquasi-orthogonalization of class subspaces, which is an effective feature\nextraction for subspace based classifiers. Interestingly, GDS projection also\nworks as a discriminant feature extraction through a similar mechanism to the\nFisher discriminant analysis (FDA). A direct proof of the connection between\nGDS projection and FDA is difficult due to the significant difference in their\nformulations. To avoid the difficulty, we first introduce geometrical Fisher\ndiscriminant analysis (gFDA) based on a simplified Fisher criterion. Our\nsimplified Fisher criterion is derived from a heuristic yet practically\nplausible principle: the direction of the sample mean vector of a class is in\nmost cases almost equal to that of the first principal component vector of the\nclass, under the condition that the principal component vectors are calculated\nby applying the principal component analysis (PCA) without data centering. gFDA\ncan work stably even under few samples, bypassing the small sample size (SSS)\nproblem of FDA. Next, we prove that gFDA is equivalent to GDS projection with a\nsmall correction term. This equivalence ensures GDS projection to inherit the\ndiscriminant ability from FDA via gFDA. Furthermore, to enhance the\nperformances of gFDA and GDS projection, we normalize the projected vectors on\nthe discriminant spaces. Extensive experiments using the extended Yale B+\ndatabase and the CMU face database show that gFDA and GDS projection have\nequivalent or better performance than the original FDA and its extensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 06:56:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 03:19:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-31"}

While saliency maps may help identify relevant features\n(e.g., pixels) in the input for classification tasks of deep neural networks,\nsimilar frameworks are understudied in unsupervised learning. Therefore, we\nintroduce a new method of obtaining saliency maps for latent representations of\nknown or novel high-level concepts, often called concept vectors in generative\nmodels. Concept scores, analogous to class scores in classification tasks, are\ndefined as dot products between concept vectors and encoded input data, which\ncan be readily used to compute the gradients. The resulting concept saliency\nmaps are shown to highlight input features deemed important for high-level\nconcepts. Our method is applied to the VAE's latent space of CelebA dataset in\nwhich known attributes such as \"smiles\" and \"hats\" are used to elucidate\nrelevant facial features. Furthermore, our application to spatial\ntranscriptomic (ST) data of a mouse olfactory bulb demonstrates the potential\nof latent representations of morphological layers and molecular features in\nadvancing our understanding of complex biological systems.

With our procedure we can reproduce\nthe $2.1^{+4.5}_{-1.7}$% detection rate of M-star debris discs of the DEBRIS\nsurvey, which implies that these discs can indeed be similar to discs around\nhotter stars and just avoid detection. We then apply this procedure to IRAM\nNIKA-2 and ALMA bands 3, 6 and 7 to predict possible detection rates and give\nrecommendations for future observations.

In general, the wavelength coverage of the\nMRS well constrains the stellar labels but the sensitivities of different\nstellar labels vary with spectral types and metallicity of the stars of\ninterest and, therefore, affect the performance of the stellar label\ndetermination from the MRS spectra.

Using the finite gap\nmethod, two of us (PGG and PMS) have recently solved, to leading order and in\nterms of elementary functions of the initial data, the NLS Cauchy problem for\ngeneric periodic initial perturbations of the unstable background solution of\nNLS (what we call the Cauchy problem of the AWs), in the case of a finite\nnumber of unstable modes. In this paper, concentrating on the simplest case of\na single unstable mode, we study the periodic Cauchy problem of the AWs for the\nNLS equation perturbed by a linear loss or gain term. Using the finite gap\nmethod and the theory of perturbations of soliton PDEs, we construct the proper\nanalytic model describing quantitatively how the solution evolves, after a\nsuitable transient, into slowly varying lower dimensional patterns (attractors)\nin the $(x,t)$ plane, characterized by $\\Delta X=L/2$ in the case of loss, and\nby $\\Delta X=0$ in the case of gain, where $\\Delta X$ is the $x$-shift of the\nposition of the AW during the recurrence, and $L$ is the period. This process\nis described, to leading order, in terms of elementary functions of the initial\ndata. Since dissipation can hardly be avoided in all natural phenomena\ninvolving AWs, and since a small dissipation induces $O(1)$ effects on the\nperiodic AW dynamics, generating the slowly varying loss/gain attractors\nanalytically described in this paper, we expect that these attractors, together\nwith their generalizations corresponding to more unstable modes, will play a\nbasic role in the theory of periodic AWs in nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 10:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

Recently, several attempts have been made to use deep\nlearning models for tackling the KT problem.

In the\ncourse of the most recent monitoring of HD54879 using FORS2 spectropolarimetric\nobservations from 2017 October to 2018 February, a longitudinal magnetic field\nstrength change from about -300G down to about -90G was reported. A sudden\nincrease of the absolute value of the mean longitudinal magnetic field and an\naccompanying spectral variability was detected on 2018 February 17. New FORS2\nspectropolarimetric data obtained from 2018 December to 2019 February confirm\nthe very slow magnetic field variability, with the field decreasing from about\n150G to -100G over two months. Such a slow magnetic field variability, related\nto the extremely slow rotation of HD54879, is also confirmed using\nhigh-resolution HARPSpol and ESPaDOnS spectropolarimetry. The re-analysis of\nthe FORS2 polarimetric spectra from 2018 February indicates that the previously\nreported field increase and the change of the spectral appearance was caused by\nimproper spectra extraction and wavelength calibration using observations\nobtained at an insufficient signal-to-noise ratio. The presented properties of\nHD54879 are discussed in the context of the Of?p spectral classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 11:42:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

It yields expressions for the elastic constants\nvalid in solid solutions with arbitrary amounts of point defects and up to the\nmelting temperature. Further, both acoustic and optical phonon eigenfrequencies\ncan be computed in linear response from the equilibrium particle densities and\nestablished classical density functionals. As a proof of principle, dispersion\nrelations are computed for two different binary crystals: A random fcc crystal\nas an example for a substitutional, and a disordered sodium chloride structure\nas an example of an interstitial solid solution. In cases where one of the\ncomponents couples only weakly to the others, the dispersion relations develop\ncharacteristic signatures.

Yet, neural networks tend to forget what they\nlearned in the past, especially when they learn online and fully incrementally,\na setting in which the weights are updated after each sample is received and\nthe sample is then discarded. Under this setting, an update can lead to overly\nglobal generalization by changing too many weights. The global generalization\ninterferes with what was previously learned and deteriorates performance, a\nphenomenon known as catastrophic interference. Many previous works use\nmechanisms such as experience replay (ER) buffers to mitigate interference by\nperforming minibatch updates, ensuring the data distribution is approximately\nindependent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.). But using ER would become\ninfeasible in terms of memory as problem complexity increases. Thus, it is\ncrucial to look for more memory-efficient alternatives. Interference can be\naverted if we replace global updates with more local ones, so only weights\nresponsible for the observed data sample are updated. In this work, we propose\nthe use of dynamic self-organizing map (DSOM) with neural networks to induce\nsuch locality in the updates without ER buffers. Our method learns a DSOM to\nproduce a mask to reweigh each hidden unit's output, modulating its degree of\nuse. It prevents interference by replacing global updates with local ones,\nconditioned on the agent's state. We validate our method on standard RL\nbenchmarks including Mountain Car and Lunar Lander, where existing methods\noften fail to learn without ER. Empirically, we show that our online and fully\nincremental method is on par with and in some cases, better than\nstate-of-the-art in terms of final performance and learning speed.

We also assume a Killing vector\nfield orthogonal to the surfaces of symmetry, which gives us static solutions,\nin the timelike Killing field case, and homogeneous dynamical solutions in the\ncase the Killing field is spacelike. In order to treat equally all the\naforementioned cases, we discuss the definition of a quasi-local energy for the\nspacetimes with planar and hyperbolic foliations, since the Hawking-Hayward\ndefinition only applies to compact foliations. After this procedure, we are\nable to translate our geometrical formalism to the fluid dynamics language in a\nunified way, to find the generalized TOV equation, for the three cases when the\nsolution is static, and to obtain the evolution equation, for the homogeneous\nspacetime cases.

To counter this,\ngovernments are focusing on enforcing safe and law-abiding behavior in traffic.\nHowever, especially in developing countries where the motorcycle is the main\nform of transportation, there is a lack of comprehensive data on the\nsafety-critical behavioral metric of motorcycle helmet use. This lack of data\nprohibits targeted enforcement and education campaigns which are crucial for\ninjury prevention. Hence, we have developed an algorithm for the automated\nregistration of motorcycle helmet usage from video data, using a deep learning\napproach. Based on 91,000 annotated frames of video data, collected at multiple\nobservation sites in 7 cities across the country of Myanmar, we trained our\nalgorithm to detect active motorcycles, the number and position of riders on\nthe motorcycle, as well as their helmet use. An analysis of the algorithm's\naccuracy on an annotated test data set, and a comparison to available\nhuman-registered helmet use data reveals a high accuracy of our approach.

Without observation site specific training, the accuracy of\nhelmet use detection decreases slightly, depending on a number of factors.

In particular, self-admitted technical debt\n(SATD) refers to those that were intentionally introduced and remarked by code\ncomments. Those technical debts reduce the quality of software and increase the\ncost of subsequent software maintenance. Therefore, it is necessary to find out\nand resolve these debts in time. Recently, many approaches have been proposed\nto identify SATD. However, those approaches either have a low accuracy or are\ncomplex to implementation in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple\nunsupervised baseline approach that fuzzily matches task annotation tags (MAT)\nto identify SATD. MAT does not need any training data to build a prediction\nmodel. Instead, MAT only examines whether any of four task tags (i.e. TODO,\nFIXME, XXX, and HACK) appears in the comments of a target project to identify\nSATD. In this sense, MAT is a natural baseline approach, which has a good\nunderstandability, in SATD identification. In order to evaluate the usefulness\nof MAT, we use 10 open-source projects to conduct the experiment. The\nexperimental results reveal that MAT has a surprisingly excellent performance\nfor SATD identification compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. As such,\nwe suggest that, in the future SATD identification studies, MAT should be\nconsidered as an easy-to-implement baseline to which any new approach should be\ncompared against to demonstrate its usefulness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 12:59:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

It is not yet clear whether these events occur due to\nthe continuous supply of free magnetic energy to the solar corona or because\nnot all of the available free magnetic energy is released during a single major\nflaring event. In order to address this question, we report on the evolution of\nphotospheric magnetic field and the associated net Lorentz force changes in ARs\n11261 and 11283, each of which gave rise to recurrent eruptive M- and X-class\nflares. Our study reveals that after the abrupt downward changes during each\nflare, the net Lorentz force increases by (2-5)x10^22 dyne in between the\nsuccessive flares. This distinct rebuild-up of net Lorentz forces is the first\nobservational evidence found in the evolution of any non-potential parameter of\nsolar active regions (ARs), which suggests that new energy was supplied to the\nARs in order to produce the recurrent large flares. The rebuild-up of magnetic\nfree energy of the ARs is further confirmed by the observations of continuous\nshearing motion of moving magnetic features of opposite polarities near the\npolarity inversion line. The evolutionary pattern of the net Lorentz force\nchanges reported in this study has significant implications, in particular, for\nthe forecasting of recurrent large eruptive flares from the same AR and hence\nthe chances of interaction between the associated CMEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 13:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

So far, the only way to overcome this BPE\nimperfection, its deterministic nature, was to create another subword\nsegmentation algorithm (Kudo, 2018).

However, the calculation of a linearizing controller\nrequires a precise dynamics model for the system. As a result, model-based\napproaches for learning exact linearizing controllers generally require a\nsimple, highly structured model of the system with easily identifiable\nparameters. In contrast, the model-free approach presented in this paper is\nable to approximate the linearizing controller for the plant using general\nfunction approximation architectures. Specifically, we formulate a\ncontinuous-time optimization problem over the parameters of a learned\nlinearizing controller whose optima are the set of parameters which best\nlinearize the plant. We derive conditions under which the learning problem is\n(strongly) convex and provide guarantees which ensure the true linearizing\ncontroller for the plant is recovered. We then discuss how model-free policy\noptimization algorithms can be used to solve a discrete-time approximation to\nthe problem using data collected from the real-world plant. The utility of the\nframework is demonstrated in simulation and on a real-world robotic platform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 13:52:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 22:34:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-23"}

Demixing of DNA from other globular\nmacromolecules results from the overall repulsion between all components of the\nsystem and leads to the formation of the nucleoid, which is the region of the\ncell that contains the genomic DNA in a rather compact form. Supercoiling\ndescribes the coiling of the axis of the DNA double helix to accommodate the\ntorsional stress injected in the molecule by topoisomerases. Supercoiling is\nable to induce some compaction of the bacterial DNA, although to a lesser\nextent than demixing. In this paper, we investigate the interplay of these two\nmechanisms, with the goal of determining whether the total compaction ratio of\nthe DNA is the mere sum or some more complex function of the compaction ratios\ndue to each mechanism. To this end, we developed a coarse-grained\nbead-and-spring model and investigated its properties through Brownian dynamics\nsimulations. This work reveals that there actually exist different regimes,\ndepending on the crowder volume ratio and the DNA superhelical density. In\nparticular, a regime where the effects of DNA demixing and supercoiling on the\ncompaction of the DNA coil simply add up is shown to exist up to moderate\nvalues of the superhelical density. In contrast, the mean radius of the DNA\ncoil no longer decreases above this threshold and may even increase again for\nsufficiently large crowder concentrations. Finally, the model predicts that the\nDNA coil may depart from the spherical geometry very close to the jamming\nthreshold, as a trade-off between the need to minimize both the bending energy\nof the stiff plectonemes and the volume of the DNA coil to accommodate\ndemixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 13:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-14"}

AC-RLNC is adaptive to the estimated\nchannel condition, and is causal, as the coding adjusts the retransmission\nrates using a priori and posteriori algorithms. In the multipath network, to\nachieve the desired throughput and delay, we propose to incorporate an adaptive\npacket allocation algorithm for retransmission, across the available resources\nof the paths. This approach is based on a discrete water filling algorithm,\ni.e., bit-filling, but, with two desired objectives, maximize throughput and\nminimize the delay. In the multipath multi-hop setting, we propose a new\ndecentralized balancing optimization algorithm. This balancing algorithm\nminimizes the throughput degradation, caused by the variations in the channel\nquality of the paths at each hop.

In contrast, the objective of our research consists of\noptimising RTB campaigns by finding out configurations that maximise both the\nnumber of impressions and their average profitability. The experiments\ndemonstrate that, when the number of required visits by advertisers is low, it\nis easy to find configurations with high average profitability, but as the\nrequired number of visits increases, the average profitability tends to go\ndown. Additionally, configuration optimisation has been combined with other\ninteresting strategies to increase, even more, the campaigns' profitability.\nAlong with parameter configuration the study considers the following\ncomplementary strategies to increase profitability: i) selecting multiple\nconfigurations with a small number of visits instead of a unique configuration\nwith a large number, ii) discarding visits according to the thresholds of cost\nand profitability, iii) analysing a reduced space of the dataset and\nextrapolating the solution, and iv) increasing the search space by including\nsolutions below the required number of visits. The developed campaign\noptimisation methodology could be offered by RTB platforms to advertisers to\nmake their campaigns more profitable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 14:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

This has\nmotivated, over the past years, new proposals of distributions on the bivariate\ntorus. The main drawback of most of these models is that the related densities\nare (pointwise) symmetric, despite the fact that the data usually present\nasymmetric patterns. This motivates the need to find a new way of constructing\nasymmetric toroidal distributions starting from a symmetric distribution. We\ntackle this problem in this paper by introducing the sine-skewed toroidal\ndistributions. The general properties of the new models are derived. Based on\nthe initial symmetric model, explicit expressions for the shape parameters are\nobtained, a simple algorithm for generating random numbers is provided, and\nasymptotic results for the maximum likelihood estimators are established. An\nimportant feature of our construction is that no normalizing constant needs to\nbe calculated, leading to more flexible distributions without increasing the\ncomplexity of the models. The benefit of employing these new sine-skewed\ndistributions is shown on the basis of protein data, where, in general, the new\nmodels outperform their symmetric antecedents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 14:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

The reason behind the vast adoption of WSNs in various\napplications is that they have tremendously appealing features, e.g., low\nproduction cost, low installation cost, unattended network operation,\nautonomous and longtime operation. WSNs have started to merge with the Internet\nof Things (IoT) through the introduction of Internet access capability in\nsensor nodes and sensing ability in Internet-connected devices. Thereby, the\nIoT is providing access to huge amount of data, collected by the WSNs, over the\nInternet. However, owing to the absence of a physical line-of-defense, i.e.\nthere is no dedicated infrastructure such as gateways to watch and observe the\nflowing information in the network, security of WSNs along with IoT is of a big\nconcern to the scientific community. Besides, recent integration and\ncollaboration of WSNs with IoT will open new challenges and problems in terms\nof security. Hence, this would be a nightmare for the individuals using these\nsystems as well as the security administrators who are managing those networks.\nTherefore, a detailed review of security attacks towards WSNs and IoT, along\nwith the techniques for prevention, detection, and mitigation of those attacks\nare provided in this paper. In this text, attacks are categorized and treated\ninto mainly two parts, most or all types of attacks towards WSNs and IoT are\ninvestigated under that umbrella: \"Passive Attacks\" and \"Active Attacks\".\nUnderstanding these attacks and their associated defense mechanisms will help\nto pave a secure path towards the proliferation and public acceptance of IoT\ntechnology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 15:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

A superpixel\nwas traditionally considered as a small cluster of square-based pixels that\nhave similar color intensities and are closely located to each other. In this\ndiscrete model the boundaries of superpixels often have irregular zigzags\nconsisting of horizontal or vertical edges from a given pixel grid. However\ndigital images represent a continuous world, hence the following continuous\nmodel in the resolution-independent formulation can be more suitable for the\nreconstruction problem.\n  Instead of uniting squares in a grid, a resolution-independent superpixel is\ndefined as a polygon that has straight edges with any possible slope at\nsubpixel resolution. The harder continuous version of the over-segmentation\nproblem is to split an image into polygons and find a best (say, constant)\ncolor of each polygon so that the resulting colored mesh well approximates the\ngiven image. Such a mesh of polygons can be rendered at any higher resolution\nwith all edges kept straight.\n  We propose a fast conversion of any traditional superpixels into polygons and\nguarantees that their straight edges do not intersect.

For the\nquality of the image reconstruction and disparity prediction, a combination of\ndifferent losses is used, including L1 image reconstruction losses and\nleft-right disparity smoothness.

Earlier\nresearch efforts focus on optimizing proactive policies under the assumption of\nknowing the future information. Recently, various techniques have been proposed\nto predict the required information, and the prediction results were then\ntreated as the true value in the optimization, i.e.,\n\"first-predict-then-optimize\". In this paper, we introduce a proactive\noptimization framework for anticipatory resource allocation, where the future\ninformation is implicitly predicted under the same objective with the policy\noptimization in a single step. An optimization problem is formulated to\nintegrate the implicit prediction and the policy optimization, based on the\nconditional distribution of the future information given the historical\nobservations. To solve such a problem, we transform it equivalently to a\nproblem depending on the joint distribution of future and historical\ninformation. Then, we resort to unsupervised learning with neural networks to\nlearn the proactive policy as a function of the past observations via\nstochastic optimization. We take proactive caching and bandwidth allocation at\nbase stations as a concrete example, where the objective function is the\nconditional expectation of successful offloading probability taken over the\nfuture popularity given the historically observed popularity.

Practical point-spread functions can\nnow be made sufficiently large to span the size of the object under measure.\nSuch large arrays can be applied to ghost imaging, which has demonstrated\npotential to greatly improve signal-to-noise ratios and reduce the total dose\nrequired for tomographic imaging.

For example, a reasonable softmax\nlayer for the dataset of interest in this paper can easily reach well beyond\n100 billion parameters (>400 GB memory). To alleviate this problem, we present\nMerged-Average Classifiers via Hashing (MACH), a generic K-classification\nalgorithm where memory provably scales at O(logK) without any strong assumption\non the classes. MACH is subtly a count-min sketch structure in disguise, which\nuses universal hashing to reduce classification with a large number of classes\nto few embarrassingly parallel and independent classification tasks with a\nsmall (constant) number of classes.

The proposed approach overcomes a key deficiency in existing\ndensity-based optimization methods that typically yield designs that do not\nhave smooth surfaces but have large number of small intricate features, which\nare difficult to manufacture even by additive manufacturing. In the proposed\napproach, Bezier curves are utilized to describe the skeleton of the design\nbeing optimized where the description of the entire design is realized by\nassigning thickness along the curves. This geometric representation technique\nensures that the optimized design is smooth and concise and can easily be tuned\nto be manufacturable by additive manufacturing. In the optimization method, the\ndensity field is described by the Heaviside function defined on the Bezier\ncurves. Compared to NURBS or B-spline based models, Bezier curves have fewer\ncontrol parameters and hence are easier to manipulate for sensitivity\nderivation, especially for distance sensitivities. Due to its powerful curve\nfitting ability, using Bezier curve to represent density field allows exploring\ndesign space effectively and generating concise structures without any\nintricate small features at the borders. Furthermore, this density\nrepresentation method is mesh independent and design variables are reduced\nsignificantly so that optimization problem can be solved efficiently using\nsmall-scale optimization algorithms such as sequential quadratic programming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 18:36:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

In\nmany applications, one of the most essential tasks is to align two or more\nnetworks to infer the similarities between cross-network vertices and discover\npotential node-level correspondence. In this paper, we propose ELRUNA\n(Elimination rule-based network alignment), a novel network alignment algorithm\nthat relies exclusively on the underlying graph structure. Under the guidance\nof the elimination rules that we defined, ELRUNA computes the similarity\nbetween a pair of cross-network vertices iteratively by accumulating the\nsimilarities between their selected neighbors. The resulting cross-network\nsimilarity matrix is then used to infer a permutation matrix that encodes the\nfinal alignment of cross-network vertices. In addition to the novel alignment\nalgorithm, we also improve the performance of local search, a commonly used\npost-processing step for solving the network alignment problem, by introducing\na novel selection method RAWSEM (Randomwalk based selection method) based on\nthe propagation of the levels of mismatching (defined in the paper) of vertices\nacross the networks. The key idea is to pass on the initial levels of\nmismatching of vertices throughout the entire network in a random-walk fashion.\nThrough extensive numerical experiments on real networks, we demonstrate that\nELRUNA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art alignment methods in\nterms of alignment accuracy under lower or comparable running time. Moreover,\nELRUNA is robust to network perturbations such that it can maintain a close to\noptimal objective value under a high level of noise added to the original\nnetworks.

The most essential capability of\nsuch companion robots is to visually interpret their surroundings and assist\nthe divers during various stages of an underwater mission. Despite recent\ntechnological advancements, the existing systems and solutions for real-time\nvisual perception are greatly affected by marine artifacts such as poor\nvisibility, lighting variation, and the scarcity of salient features. The\ndifficulties are exacerbated by a host of non-linear image distortions caused\nby the vulnerabilities of underwater light propagation (e.g.,\nwavelength-dependent attenuation, absorption, and scattering). In this\ndissertation, we present a set of novel and improved visual perception\nsolutions to address these challenges for effective underwater human-robot\ncooperation.\n  Specifically, we develop robust and efficient modules for Autonomous\nUnderwater Vehicles (AUVs) to follow and interact with companion divers by\naccurately perceiving their surroundings while relying on noisy visual sensing\nalone. Moreover, our proposed perception solutions enable visually-guided\nrobots to see better in noisy sensing conditions and do better with limited\ncomputational resources and real-time constraints. The research outcomes entail\nnovel design and efficient implementation of the underlying vision and\nlearning-based algorithms with extensive field experimental validations and\nfeasibility analyses for single-board deployments. In addition to advancing the\nstate-of-the-art, the proposed methodologies and systems take us one step\ncloser toward bridging the gap between theory and practice for improved\nhuman-robot cooperation in the wild.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 01:48:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 05:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

The ability to balance exploration with\nexploitation makes the multi-armed bandits an efficient alternative to the\nconventional methods, and a robust user segmentation plays a crucial role in\nproviding the context for such online recommendation algorithms. In this work,\nwe present an unsupervised and trend-responsive method for segmenting users\naccording to their semantic interests, which has been integrated with a\nreal-world system for large-scale news recommendations. The results of an\nonline A/B test show significant improvements compared to a global-optimization\nalgorithm on several services with different characteristics. Based on the\nexperimental results as well as the exploration of segments descriptions and\ntrend dynamics, we propose extensions to this approach that address particular\nreal-world challenges for different use-cases. Moreover, we describe a method\nof generating traceable publishing insights facilitating the creation of\ncontent that serves the diversity of all users needs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 18:42:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}
