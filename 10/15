The ECAL trigger\nsystem employs fast digital signal processing algorithms to precisely measure\nthe energy and timing information of ECAL energy deposits recorded during LHC\ncollisions. These trigger primitives are transmitted to the Level-1 trigger\nsystem at the LHC collisions rate of 40 MHz. These energy deposits are then\ncombined with information from other CMS sub-detectors to determine whether the\nevent should trigger the readout of the data from CMS to permanent storage.\nThis presentation will summarize the ECAL trigger performance achieved during\nLHC Run 2 (2015-2018). It will describe the methods that are used to provide\nfrequent calibrations of the ECAL trigger primitives during LHC operation.\nThese are needed to account for radiation-induced changes in crystal and\nphotodetector response, and to minimize the spurious triggering on direct\nsignals in the photodetectors used in the barrel region ($\\eta<$1.48).

In quantum simulation, a complicated Hamiltonian describing\nthe dynamics of a quantum system is decomposed into its constituent terms,\nwhere the effect of each term during time-evolution is individually computed.\nFor many physical systems, the Hamiltonian has a large number of terms,\nconstraining the scalability of established simulation methods. To address this\nlimitation we introduce a new scheme that approximates the actual Hamiltonian\nwith a sparser Hamiltonian containing fewer terms. By stochastically\nsparsifying weaker Hamiltonian terms, we benefit from a quadratic suppression\nof errors relative to deterministic approaches. Relying on optimality\nconditions from convex optimisation theory, we derive an appropriate\nprobability distribution for the weaker Hamiltonian terms, and compare its\nerror bounds with other probability ansatzes for some electronic structure\nHamiltonians. Tuning the sparsity of our approximate Hamiltonians allows our\nscheme to interpolate between two recent random compilers: qDRIFT and\nrandomized first order Trotter. Our scheme is thus an algorithm that combines\nthe strengths of randomised Trotterisation with the efficiency of qDRIFT, and\nfor intermediate gate budgets, outperforms both of these prior methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 16:28:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 17:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

In\nthis work we introduce 21cmGEM - the first emulator of the global 21-cm signal\nfrom Cosmic Dawn and the EoR. The smoothness of the output signal is guaranteed\nby design. We train neural networks to predict the cosmological signal using a\ndatabase of ~30,000 simulated signals which were created by varying seven\nastrophysical parameters: the star formation efficiency and the minimal mass of\nstar-forming halos; the efficiency of the first X-ray sources and their\nspectrum parameterized by spectral index and the low energy cutoff; the mean\nfree path of ionizing photons and the CMB optical depth. We test the\nperformance with a set of ~2,000 simulated signals, showing that the relative\nerror in the prediction has an r.m.s. of 0.0159.

Making\nmeasurements in a third channel would provide useful information about the\nmicroscopic anti-correlation phenomenon.

Malicious URLs are delivered to unsuspecting users via email, text\nmessages, pop-ups or advertisements. Clicking on or crawling such URLs can\nresult in compromised email accounts, launching of phishing campaigns, download\nof malware, spyware and ransomware, as well as severe monetary losses. A\nmachine learning based ensemble classification approach is proposed to detect\nmalicious URLs in emails, which can be extended to other methods of delivery of\nmalicious URLs. The approach uses static lexical features extracted from the\nURL string, with the assumption that these features are notably different for\nmalicious and benign URLs. The use of such static features is safer and faster\nsince it does not involve crawling the URLs or blacklist lookups which tend to\nintroduce a significant amount of latency in producing verdicts. The goal of\nthe classification was to achieve high sensitivity i.e. detect as many\nmalicious URLs as possible. URL strings tend to be very unstructured and noisy.\nHence, bagging algorithms were found to be a good fit for the task since they\naverage out multiple learners trained on different parts of the training data,\nthus reducing variance. The classification model was tested on five different\ntesting sets and produced an average False Negative Rate (FNR) of 0.1%, average\naccuracy of 92% and average AUC of 0.98. The model is presently being used in\nthe FireEye Advanced URL Detection Engine (used to detect malicious URLs in\nemails), to generate fast real-time verdicts on URLs. The malicious URL\ndetections from the engine have gone up by 22% since the deployment of the\nmodel into the engine workflow.

An issue of importance for the\npotential habitability of terrestrial planets is whether they could experience\nsnowball events (periods of global glaciation). Previous work using an\nintermediate complexity atmospheric Global Climate Model (GCM) with no ocean\nheat transport suggested that tidally locked planets would smoothly transition\nto a snowball, in contrast with Earth, which has bifurcations and hysteresis in\nclimate state associated with global glaciation.

While gradually transitioning to NFV, Internet\nservice providers face the problem of where to introduce NFV in order to make\nthe most benefit of that; here, we measure the benefit by the amount of traffic\nthat can be served in an NFV-enabled network. This problem is non-trivial as it\nis composed of two challenging subproblems: 1) placement of nodes to support\nvirtual network functions (referred to as VNF-nodes); 2) allocation of the\nVNF-nodes' resources to network flows. This problem has been studied for the\none-dimensional setting, where all network flows require one network function,\nwhich requires a unit of resource to process a unit of flow. In this work, we\nconsider the multi-dimensional setting, where flows must be processed by\nmultiple network functions, which require a different amount of each resource\nto process a unit of flow. The multi-dimensional setting introduces new\nchallenges in addition to those of the one-dimensional setting (e.g.,\nNP-hardness and non-submodularity) and also makes the resource allocation\nsubproblem a multi-dimensional generalization of the generalized assignment\nproblem with assignment restrictions. To address these difficulties, we propose\na novel two-level relaxation method that allows us to draw a connection to the\nsequence submodular theory and utilize the property of sequence submodularity\nalong with the primal-dual technique to design two approximation algorithms. We\nfurther prove that the proposed algorithms have a non-trivial approximation\nratio that depends on the number of VNF-nodes, resources, and a measure of the\navailable resource compared to flow demand. Finally, we perform trace-driven\nsimulations to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 17:27:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 May 2020 22:39:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 18:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

To cope\nwith the gap between the instruction throughput and the memory bandwidth of\ncurrent generation GPUs, our solver forms the tensor product linear system\non-the-fly without storing it in memory when performing matrix-vector dot\nproduct operations in PCG. Such on-the-fly computation is accomplished by using\nthreads in a warp to cooperatively stream the adjacency and edge label matrices\nof individual graphs by small square matrix blocks called tiles, which are then\nstaged in registers and the shared memory for later reuse. Warps across a\nthread block can further share tiles via the shared memory to increase data\nreuse. We exploit the sparsity of the graphs hierarchically by storing only\nnon-empty tiles using a coordinate format and nonzero elements within each tile\nusing bitmaps.

In addition,\ndust grains can be destroyed in a hot or turbulent medium. The adopted\ntimescale of dust removal usually relies on uncertain theoretical estimates. It\nis tricky to track the dust removal, because usually dust is constantly\nreplenished by consecutive generations of stars. Our objective is to measure\nobservationally the timescale of dust removal. We here explore an approach to\nselect galaxies which do have detectable amounts of dust and cold ISM but\nexhibit a low current dust production rate. Any decrease of the dust and gas\ncontent as a function of the age of such galaxies therefore must be attributed\nto processes governing the ISM removal. We used a sample of galaxies detected\nby Herschel in the far-infrared with visually assigned early-type morphology or\nspirals with red colours. We also obtained JCMT/SCUBA-2 observations for five\nof them.

It absorbs ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR)\nradiation and re-emits this energy in the far-infrared (FIR). The FIR is\nessential to understand dust in galaxies. However, deep FIR observations\nrequire a space mission, none of which are still active today. We aim to infer\nthe FIR emission across six Herschel bands, along with dust luminosity, mass,\nand effective temperature, based on the available UV to mid-infrared (MIR)\nobservations. We also want to estimate the uncertainties of these predictions,\ncompare our method to energy balance SED fitting, and determine possible\nlimitations of the model. We propose a machine learning framework to predict\nthe FIR fluxes from 14 UV-MIR broadband fluxes. We used a low redshift sample\nby combining DustPedia and H-ATLAS, and extracted Bayesian flux posteriors\nthrough SED fitting. We trained shallow neural networks to predict the\nfar-infrared fluxes, uncertainties, and dust properties. We evaluated them on a\ntest set using a root mean square error (RMSE) in log-space. Our results (RMSE\n= 0.19 dex) significantly outperform UV-MIR energy balance SED fitting (RMSE =\n0.38 dex), and are inherently unbiased.

A\nproxy for the spinning dust emissivity reveals large variations within the\ncomplex, with a dynamic range of 25 at 3$\\sigma$ and a variation by a factor of\nat least 23, at 3$\\sigma$, between the peak in $\\rho$ Oph W and the location of\nS1, which means that environmental factors are responsible for boosting\nspinning dust emissivities locally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 18:09:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 22:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-06"}

Unlike the time-frequency domain approaches, the time-domain\nseparation systems often receive input sequences consisting of a huge number of\ntime steps, which introduces challenges for modeling extremely long sequences.\nConventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are not effective for modeling\nsuch long sequences due to optimization difficulties, while one-dimensional\nconvolutional neural networks (1-D CNNs) cannot perform utterance-level\nsequence modeling when its receptive field is smaller than the sequence length.\nIn this paper, we propose dual-path recurrent neural network (DPRNN), a simple\nyet effective method for organizing RNN layers in a deep structure to model\nextremely long sequences. DPRNN splits the long sequential input into smaller\nchunks and applies intra- and inter-chunk operations iteratively, where the\ninput length can be made proportional to the square root of the original\nsequence length in each operation.

Imagine that\nmultiple items or services are available to be shared among a set of interested\nagents. The outcome of a mechanism in this setting consists of an assignment,\ndetermining for each item the set of players who are granted service, together\nwith respective payments. Although there are several works studying specialized\nversions of such problems, there has been almost no progress for general\ncombinatorial cost sharing domains until recently \\cite{DobzinskiO17}. The main\ngoal of our work is to further understand this interplay in terms of budget\nbalance and social cost approximation. Towards this, we provide a refinement of\ncross-monotonicity (trace-monotonicity) that is applicable to iterative\nmechanisms. The trace here refers to the order in which players become\nfinalized. On top of this, we also provide two parameterizations of cost\nfunctions which capture the behavior of their average cost-shares. Based on our\ntrace-monotonicity property, we design a scheme of ascending cost sharing\nmechanisms which is applicable to the combinatorial cost sharing setting with\nsymmetric submodular valuations. Using our first cost function\nparameterization, we identify conditions under which our mechanism is weakly\ngroup-strategyproof, $O(1)$-budget-balanced and $O(H_n)$-approximate with\nrespect to the social cost. Finally, we consider general valuation functions\nand exploit our second parameterization to derive a more fine-grained analysis\nof the Sequential Mechanism introduced by Moulin.

Suppose regression observations\n$(X_1,Y_1),\\ldots,(X_n,Y_n)\\in\\mathbb{R}^d\\times\\mathbb{R}$ (not necessarily\nindependent) are available. Some of the questions we deal with are as follows:\nunder what conditions, does the OLS estimator converge and what is the limit?\nWhat happens if the dimension is allowed to grow with $n$? What happens if the\nobservations are dependent with dependence possibly strengthening with $n$? How\nto do statistical inference under these kinds of misspecification?

This\nbiases the observed tangential shear profiles around galaxies, the so-called\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) signal, and the related excess mass profile.\nCorrespondingly, inference of physical quantities, such as the mean mass\nprofile of halos around galaxies, are affected by magnification effects. We use\nsimulated shear and galaxy data of the Millennium Simulation to quantify the\neffect on shear and mass estimates from magnified lens and source number\ncounts. The former are due to the large-scale matter distribution in the\nforeground of the lenses, the latter are caused by magnification of the source\npopulation by the matter associated with the lenses. The GGL signal is\ncalculated from the simulations by an efficient fast-Fourier transform that can\nalso be applied to real data. The numerical treatment is complemented by a\nleading-order analytical description of the magnification effects, which is\nshown to fit the numerical shear data well. We find the magnification effect is\nstrongest for steep galaxy luminosity functions and high redshifts. For a lens\nredshift of $z_\\mathrm{d}=0.83$, a limiting magnitude of $22\\,\\mathrm{mag}$ in\nthe $r$-band and a source redshift of $z_\\mathrm{s}=0.99$, we find that a\nmagnification correction changes the shear profile up to $45\\%$ and the mass is\nbiased by up to $55 \\%$. For medium-redshift galaxies the relative change in\nshear and mass is typically a few percent. As expected, the sign of the bias\ndepends on the local slope of the lens luminosity function $\\alpha_\\mathrm{d}$,\nwhere the mass is biased low for $\\alpha_\\mathrm{d}<1$ and biased high for\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{d}>1$. Whereas the magnification effect of sources is rarely\nthan more $1\\%$, the statistical power of future weak lensing surveys warrants\ncorrection for this effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 20:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 2021 10:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

In particular, the easiness with which generators with\nlong periods could be defined gave the Mersenne Twister a large following, in\nspite of the fact that such long periods are not a measure of quality, and they\nrequire a large amount of memory. Even at the time of its publication, several\ndefects of the Mersenne Twister were predictable, but they were somewhat\nobscured by other interesting properties. Today the Mersenne Twister is the\ndefault generator in C compilers, the Python language, the Maple mathematical\ncomputation system, and in many other environments.

A well known conjecture says\nthat generically (with respect to perturbations of the periodic potential) the\nextrema are attained by a single branch of the dispersion relation, are\nisolated, and have non-degenerate Hessian (i.e., dispersion relations are\ngraphs of Morse functions). The important notion of effective masses in solid\nstate physics, as well as Liouville property, Green's function asymptotics,\netc. hinge upon this property. The progress in proving this conjecture has been\nslow. It is natural to try to look at discrete problems, where the dispersion\nrelation is (in appropriate coordinates) an algebraic, rather than analytic,\nvariety. Such models are often used for computation in solid state physics (the\ntight binding model). Alas, counterexamples exist in some discrete situations.\nWe start establishing the following dichotomy: the non-degeneracy of extrema\neither fails or holds in the complement of a proper algebraic subset of the\nparameters.\n  The known counterexample has only two free parameters.

In this work, we investigate the effects of varying radius and\ngravity on the climate of rapidly rotating terrestrial planets with assuming\nthey have an ocean and Earth-like atmospheres (N$_2$, CO$_2$, and H$_2$O).\nUsing a three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric general circulation model (GCM), we\nfind that varying radius mainly influences the equator-to-pole surface\ntemperature difference while varying gravity mainly influences the mean surface\ntemperature. For planets of larger radii, the meridional atmospheric energy\ntransport is weaker, which warms the tropics but cools high latitudes. For\nplanets of larger gravities, the surface is globally cooler due to the fact\nthat saturated vapor pressure depends on air temperature only and column water\nvapor mass is approximately equal to saturated vapor pressure over gravity\nmultiplied by relative humidity. The relative humidity does not change much in\nour experiments. Ice albedo and water vapor feedbacks act to further amplify\nthe effects of varying radius and gravity. These results suggest that radius\nand gravity are important factors for planetary climate, although they are not\nas critical as stellar flux, atmospheric composition and mass, and rotation\nrate.

A phenomenon of particular\nimportance, known to take place in opinion formation, is echo chambers'\nappearance. In the present work, we approach this phenomenon, while emphasizing\nthe influence of contrarian opinions in a multi-opinion scenario. To define the\ncontrarian opinion, we considered the Underdog effect, which is the eventual\ntendency of people to support the less popular option. We also considered an\nadaptation of the Sznajd dynamics with the possibility of friendship rewiring,\nperformed on several network models. We analyze the relationship between\ntopology and opinion dynamics by considering two measurements: opinion\ndiversity and network modularity. Two specific situations have been addressed:\n(i) the agents can reconnect only with others sharing the same opinion; and\n(ii) same as in the previous case, but with the agents reconnecting only within\na limited neighborhood.

In conventional human-type communications (HTC), due to the\nlimited number of available radio resources and orthogonal/non-overlapping\nnature of existing resource allocation techniques, users need to compete for\nconnectivity through a random access (RA) process, which may turn into a\nperformance bottleneck in mMTC. In this context, non-orthogonal multiple access\n(NOMA) has emerged as a potential technology that allows overlapping of\nmultiple users over a radio resource, thereby creating an opportunity to enable\nmore autonomous and grant-free communication, where devices can transmit data\nwhenever they need. The existing literature on NOMA schemes majorly considers\ncentralized scheduling based HTC, where users are already connected, and\nvarious system parameters like spreading sequences, interleaving patterns,\npower control, etc., are predefined. Contrary to HTC, mMTC traffic is different\nwith mostly uplink communication, small data size per device, diverse quality\nof service, autonomous nature, and massive number of devices. Hence, the\nsignaling overhead and latency of centralized scheduling becomes a potential\nperformance bottleneck. To tackle this, grant-free access is needed, where mMTC\ndevices can autonomously transmit their data over randomly chosen radio\nresources.

X-shaped radio galaxies (XRGs) exhibit a pair of bright primary\nlobes and a pair of weak secondary lobes (wings), which are oriented with an\nangle that gives the structure a cross-like shape. Though several theoretical\nmodels have been proposed to explain their origin, there is currently not a\ngeneral consensus on a formation scenario. Aims. We analysed new multifrequency\nKarl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) radio data at 1.5, 5.5, 6, and 9 GHz of\nthe candidate XRG in Abell 3670 (A3670) in order to characterise and classify\nit for the first time and to investigate its origin. Methods. We produced flux,\nspectral index, and radiative age maps of A3670 by means of the new radio data.\nWe investigated the connection between the radio galaxy and its host, a\nbrightest cluster galaxy (BCG) with two optical nuclei classified as a dumbbell\ngalaxy. Finally we discussed the literature models and compared them to the\nobserved properties of A3670. Results. We classify A3670 as a Fanaroff-Riley\nI-type XRG and measured a 1.4 GHz radio power of 1.7 x 10^25 W Hz-1. By\nestimating the radiative age of the various source components, we find that the\nwings are 20 Myr older than the lobes. We verified that the lobes and wings are\naligned with the major and minor axes of the optical galaxy, respectively, and\nwe estimated a black hole mass of 10^9 Msun , which is in agreement with the\ntypical properties of the XRGs. Conclusions. Among the discussed scenarios, the\njet-shell interaction model may best reproduce the observed properties of\nA3670. The gas of a stellar shell is responsible for the deflection of the\njets, thus forming the wings. The presence of stellar shells in A3670 is\nplausible, but it needs further optical observations to be confirmed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 07:43:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Generally, magnetic field has DC and AC\ncomponents and it is hard to extract both DC and AC components simultaneously.\nThe conventional Ramsey interferometry can easily measure DC magnetic fields,\nwhile it becomes invalid for AC magnetic fields since the accumulated phases\nmay average to zero. Here, we propose a scheme for simultaneous measurement of\nDC and AC magnetic fields by combining Ramsey interferometry and rapid periodic\npulses. In our scheme, the interrogation stage is divided into two signal\naccumulation processes linked by a unitary operation. In the first process,\nonly DC component contributes to the accumulated phase. In the second process,\nby applying multiple rapid periodic $\\pi$ pulses, only the AC component gives\nrise to the accumulated phase.

In this paper, we propose a new 2D CNN based network,\nTrajectoryNet, to predict future poses in the trajectory space. Compared with\nmost existing methods, our model focuses on modeling the motion dynamics with\ncoupled spatio-temporal features, local-global spatial features and global\ntemporal co-occurrence features of the previous pose sequence. Specifically,\nthe coupled spatio-temporal features describe the spatial and temporal\nstructure information hidden in the natural human motion sequence, which can be\nmined by covering the space and time dimensions of the input pose sequence with\nthe convolutional filters. The local-global spatial features that encode\ndifferent correlations of different joints of the human body (e.g. strong\ncorrelations between joints of one limb, weak correlations between joints of\ndifferent limbs) are captured hierarchically by enlarging the receptive field\nlayer by layer and residual connections from the lower layers to the deeper\nlayers in our proposed convolutional network. And the global temporal\nco-occurrence features represent the co-occurrence relationship that different\nsubsequences in a complex motion sequence are appeared simultaneously, which\ncan be obtained automatically with our proposed TrajectoryNet by reorganizing\nthe temporal information as the depth dimension of the input tensor. Finally,\nfuture poses are approximated based on the captured motion dynamics features.\nExtensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on three challenging benchmarks (e.g. Human3.6M, G3D, and FNTU),\nwhich demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.

However, basic predictions of such mass loss\nstill suffer from significant quantitative uncertainties. Aims: We develop new\nradiation-driven, steady-state wind models for massive stars with hot surfaces,\nsuitable for quantitative predictions of global parameters like mass-loss and\nwind-momentum rates. Methods: The simulations presented here are based on a\nself-consistent, iterative grid-solution to the spherically symmetric,\nsteady-state equation of motion, using full NLTE radiative transfer solutions\nin the co-moving frame to derive the radiative acceleration. We do not rely on\nany distribution functions or parametrization for computation of the line force\nresponsible for the wind driving. Results: In this first paper, we present\nmodels representing two prototypical O-stars in the Galaxy, one with a higher\nstellar mass M/Msun=59 and luminosity log10(L/Lsun)= 5.87 and one with a lower\nM/Msun= 27 and log10(L/Lsun)= 5.1.

A\nkey result is that our mass-loss rates are significantly lower than those\npredicted by the mass-loss recipes normally included in models of massive-star\nevolution. Conclusions: Our results support previous suggestions that Galactic\nO-star mass-loss rates may be overestimated in present-day stellar evolution\nmodels, and that new rates thus might be needed.

A number of different proxies\nare often collected for a given theory and the uneven nature of this collection\nrequires care when employing model averaging. Furthermore, if valid, these\ntheories ought to be relevant outside of any single narrowly focused outcome\nequation. We propose a methodology which treats theories as represented by\nlatent indices, these latent processes controlled by model averaging on the\nproxy level. To achieve generalizability of the theory index our framework\nassumes a collection of outcome equations. We accommodate a flexible set of\ngeneralized additive models, enabling non-Gaussian outcomes to be included.\nFurthermore, selection of relevant theories also occurs on the outcome level,\nallowing for theories to be differentially valid.

There is experimental evidence that supports the fact\nthat hydrogen influences void nucleation, growth and coalescence during\nmaterial fracture [4]. This work investigates the effect of hydrogen on void\ngrowth and coalescence in austenitic stainless steel. The effect of hydrogen on\nvoid growth and coalescence for different stress triaxialities has been\nexamined by analysing the stress strain response of a single crystal\nrepresentative volume element (RVE). The results show that the higher the\nstress triaxiality, the lower the equivalent stress required to yield. This\nresponse is found to be similar irrespective of whether the material is being\nexposed to hydrogen or not. Lower equivalent strain values to yield were\nexperienced for higher stress triaxialities for both hydrogen free and\nhydrogenated samples. Hydrogen slowed down void growth at high stress\ntriaxialities but promoted void growth as lower triaxialities. For lower\ntriaxialities, the presence of hydrogen was found to initially inhibit void\ngrowth at low equivalent strain values. However, this effect reversed at higher\nequivalent strain values and hydrogen was found to promote void growth. The\neffect of hydrogen promoting or inhibiting void growth have been shown to\nincrease in magnitude with increasing hydrogen concentration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 09:03:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-18"}

Through a combination of analytics, exact diagonalization\nand tensor-network methods we show the existence of a transition, from a fast\nto a slow thermalization regime, which manifests itself throughout the\nspectrum. On the slow side, by exploiting the localization of the ground state\nand the form of the Hamiltonian, we explicitly construct a large (exponential\nin size) number of non-thermal states which become exact finite-energy-density\neigenstates in the large-size limit, as expected for a true phase transition. A\n``super-spin'' generalization allows us to find a further large class of\narea-law states proved to display very slow relaxation. These states retain\nmemory of their initial conditions for extremely long times. Our numerical\nanalysis reveals that the localization properties are not limited to the ground\nstate and that} many eigenstates have large overlap with product states and can\nbe approximated well by matrix product states at arbitrary energy densities.\nThe mechanism that induces localization to the ground state, and hence the\nnon-thermal behavior of the system, can be extended to a wide range of models\nincluding a number of simple spin chains.

Unfortunately, the traditional networking\narchitecture supports limited and fixed network computations. These limitations\ninhibit flexible and robust IoT nodes communication. In addition, the energy\nconsumption in communication nodes is high due to limited processing. To\naddress these issues, this paper gives rebirth to the active system.

In this parameterization all electrons and\nelectron pairs are indistinguishable which eliminates the exponential scaling\nwith the number of particles plaguing all other correlation methods. An\nexponential scaling shown to stem from the expansion of the wave function in\none-particle basis sets. It is demonstrated that using a geminal basis with a\nskew-symmetric orthogonal coefficient matrix, which fulfill a Lie algebra, the\nparameterization of the exact wave function becomes independent of the number\nof particles and only scale quadratic with the number of basis functions in the\noptimized basis and quartic in an arbitrary basis. The resulting\nantisymmetrized geminal power wave function is shown to fulfill the necessary\nand sufficient conditions for the exact wave function, treat all electrons and\nelectron pairs as indistinguishable and be the most compact representation of\nthe exact wave function possible. The number of parameters in the\nantisymmetrized geminal power wave function is exactly the same number of\nparameters as in the two-particle reduced density matrix thereby showing that\nthese representations are equivalent just like the representations for a\none-particle Hamiltonian. A detailed discussion of how the most compact wave\nfunction can be derived in general is also presented along with different\ngeminal ans\\\"atze and sufficient closure relations. Due to the breaking of the\nscaling wall for the exact wave function it is expected that, if a general set\nof constraints can be found, even systems of biological relevance can be\ntreated exactly in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 10:12:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 12:37:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 09:33:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2020 20:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

To efficiently execute these\napplications, vehicular edge computing (VEC) can be employed.

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate an optimal offloading\nstrategy for effective energy savings in energy-limited vehicles. In this\npaper, we consider the changes of communication environment due to various\nspeeds of vehicles, which are not considered in previous studies. Then, we\njointly optimize the offloading proportion and uplink/computation/downlink bit\nallocation of multiple vehicles, for the purpose of minimizing the total energy\nconsumption of the vehicles under the delay constraint.

However, the ballistocardiogram (BCG), a large-amplitude artifact\ncaused by cardiac induced movement contaminates the EEG during EEG-fMRI\nrecordings. Removal of BCG in software has generally made use of linear\ndecompositions of the corrupted EEG. This is not ideal as the BCG signal is\nnon-stationary and propagates in a manner which is non-linearly dependent on\nthe electrocardiogram (ECG). In this paper, we present a novel method for BCG\nartifact suppression using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Methods: EEG\nsignals were recovered by training RNNs on the nonlinear mappings between ECG\nand the BCG corrupted EEG. We evaluated our model's performance against the\ncommonly used Optimal Basis Set (OBS) method at the level of individual\nsubjects, and investigated generalization across subjects. Results: We show\nthat our algorithm can generate larger average power reduction of the BCG at\ncritical frequencies, while simultaneously improving task relevant EEG based\nclassification. Conclusion: The presented deep learning architecture can be\nused to reduce BCG related artifacts in EEG-fMRI recordings. Significance: We\npresent a deep learning approach that can be used to suppress the BCG artifact\nin EEG-fMRI without the use of additional hardware. This method may have scope\nto be combined with current hardware methods, operate in real-time and be used\nfor direct modeling of the BCG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 11:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-29"}

The understanding of these phenomena,\nhowever, has been a matter of debate over the past two decades. In this work,\nwe demonstrate a unified phonon interpretation of non-Fourier heat conduction\nwhich can help to understand these phenomena by a mode-to-mode correspondence\nbetween the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations and the\nmode-resolved phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). It is found that the\nnanoscale phonon transport characteristics including temperature profile, the\nheat flux value and the modal temperature depend on the applied thermal\nreservoirs on the two contacts. Our NEMD simulations demonstrate that Langevin\nthermostat behaves like an infinitely large thermal reservoir and provides\nthermally equilibrium mode-resolved phonon outlets, while biased reservoirs,\ne.g., Nose-Hoover chain thermostat and velocity rescaling method behave like\nnon-equilibrium phonon outlets. Our interpretation clearly demonstrates that\nthe non-Fourier heat transport phenomena are originated from a combination of\nnon-diffusive phonon transport and phonon thermal nonequilibrium. This work\nprovides a clear understanding of nanoscale heat transport and may guide the\nmeasurement and control of thermal transport in various applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 11:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

Many recent studies propose CNN accelerator architectures with\ncustom computation units that try to improve energy-efficiency and performance\nof CNNs by minimizing data transfers from DRAM-based main memory. However, in\nthese architectures, DRAM is still responsible for half of the overall energy\nconsumption of the system, on average. A key factor of the high energy\nconsumption of DRAM is the refresh overhead, which is estimated to consume 40%\nof the total DRAM energy. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism, Refresh\nTriggered Computation (RTC), that exploits the memory access patterns of CNN\napplications to reduce the number of refresh operations. We propose three RTC\ndesigns (min-RTC, mid-RTC, and full-RTC), each of which requires a different\nlevel of aggressiveness in terms of customization to the DRAM subsystem. All of\nour designs have small overhead. Even the most aggressive RTC design (i.e.,\nfull-RTC) imposes an area overhead of only 0.18% in a 16 Gb DRAM chip and can\nhave less overhead for denser chips. Our experimental evaluation on six\nwell-known CNNs show that RTC reduces average DRAM energy consumption by 24.4%\nand 61.3%, for the least aggressive and the most aggressive RTC\nimplementations, respectively. Besides CNNs, we also evaluate our RTC mechanism\non three workloads from other domains. We show that RTC saves 31.9% and 16.9%\nDRAM energy for Face Recognition and Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural\nNetwork (BCPNN), respectively. We believe RTC can be applied to other\napplications whose memory access patterns remain predictable for a sufficiently\nlong time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 12:02:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 13:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-08"}

This\nfinding creates the opportunity for bi-objective optimization of applications\nfor performance and energy. We propose and study the first application-level\nmethod for bi-objective optimization of multithreaded data-parallel\napplications for performance and energy. The method uses two decision\nvariables, the number of identical multithreaded kernels (threadgroups)\nexecuting the application and the number of threads in each threadgroup, with\nthe workload always partitioned equally between the threadgroups. We\nexperimentally demonstrate the efficiency of the method using four highly\noptimized multithreaded data-parallel applications, 2D fast Fourier transform\nbased on FFTW and Intel MKL, and dense matrix-matrix multiplication using\nOpenBLAS and Intel MKL. Four modern multicore CPUs are used in the experiments.\nThe experiments show that optimization for performance alone results in the\nincrease in dynamic energy consumption by up to 89% and optimization for\ndynamic energy alone degrades the performance by up to 49%.

Finally, we propose a qualitative dynamic energy\nmodel employing performance monitoring counters as parameters, which we use to\nexplain the discovered energy nonproportionality and the Pareto-optimal\nsolutions determined by our method.

In\nclinical routine, a common reconstruction approach is the use of maximum\nlikelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) stopped after few iterations.\nEmpirically it was reported that, at matched number of iterations, the\nintroduction of TOF increases noise. In this work we revise the theory\ndescribing the signal and noise convergence in MLEM, and we adapt it to\ndescribe the TOF impact on early stopped MLEM. We validated theoretical results\nusing both computer simulations and phantom measurements, performed on scanners\nwith different coincidence timing resolutions. This work provides theoretical\nsupport for the empirically observed noise increase introduced by TOF.\nConversely, it shows that TOF not only improves signal convergence but also\nmakes it less dependent on the activity distribution in the field of view. We\nthen propose a strategy to determine stopping criteria for TOF-MLEM, which\nreduces the number of iterations by a factor proportional to the coincidence\ntiming resolution. We prove that this criteria succeeds in markedly reducing\nnoise, while improving signal recovery robustness as it provides a level of\ncontrast recovery which is independent from the object dimension and from the\nactivity distribution of the background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 12:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

For this purpose, a scheme for discretization of\ncontinuous-time data is proposed by considering the quantiles of the estimated\nevent-time distribution, and, for smaller data sets, it is found to be\npreferable over the commonly used equidistant scheme. Furthermore, two\ninterpolation schemes for continuous-time survival estimates are explored, both\nof which are shown to yield improved performance compared to the discrete-time\nestimates. The survival methods considered are based on the likelihood for\nright-censored survival data, and parameterize either the probability mass\nfunction (PMF) or the discrete-time hazard rate, both with neural networks.\nThrough simulations and study of real-world data, the hazard rate\nparametrization is found to perform slightly better than the parametrization of\nthe PMF. Inspired by these investigations, a continuous-time method is proposed\nby assuming that the continuous-time hazard rate is piecewise constant. The\nmethod, named PC-Hazard, is found to be highly competitive with the\naforementioned methods in addition to other methods for survival prediction\nfound in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 13:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

As a consequence,\nat certain high-symmetry points in the momentum space, the magnetic point group\nallows the spin angular momentum to be locked to the linear momentum, a typical\nfeature of the Rashba effect. In such a case, spin-splitting effects induced by\nspin-orbit coupling can arise, similar to what happens in non-magnetic Rashba\nsystems. As a prototypical example, ab-initio calculations of antiferromagnetic\nBiCoO3 in the polar structure reveal that a large Rashba-like band- and spin-\nsplitting occurs at the conduction band bottom, having a large weight from Bi-p\norbital states.

These findings provide\nan efficient route for realizing all-electrical and gate-tunable spin-orbit\ntechnology using TIs and graphene in heterostructures, which can enhance the\nperformance and reduce power dissipation in spintronic circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 13:59:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 10:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-10"}

We also identify some\nopen problems that remain to be addressed to create a viable solution for\nfederated learning in coalition environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 16:40:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

This inherently reduces the source brightness to 50 %. Critically,\nfor some quantum applications the total efficiency from generation to detection\nmust be over 50 %. Here, we demonstrate a resonant-excitation approach to\ncreating single photons that is free of any cross-polarization, and in fact any\nfiltering whatsoever. It potentially increases single-photon rates and\ncollection efficiencies, and simplifies operation. This integrated device\nallows us to resonantly excite single quantum-dot states in several cavities in\nthe plane of the device using connected waveguides, while the cavity-enhanced\nsingle-photon fluorescence is directed vertical (off-chip) in a Gaussian mode.\nWe expect this design to be a prototype for larger chip-scale quantum\nphotonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 14:30:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

This is achieved with the help of an autoencoder architecture\nwith two different types of operational layers in the latent-space: a fully\nconnected multi-layer perceptron and convolutional long short-term memory\nlayers. A wall-resolved large eddy simulation of a turbulent channel flow at a\nhigh Reynolds number is performed to create a large database of instantaneous\nsnapshots of turbulent flow-fields used to train neural networks. The training\nis performed with sequences of instantaneous snapshots so as to learn a\nsnapshot at the next time instant. For the present work, velocity and pressure\nfluctuations are used for training to produce the same parameters at the next\ntime instant. Within the autoencoders, different types of methods like average\npooling and strided convolutions are tested for the reduction of spatial\ndimensions. For convolutional neural networks, the physical boundary conditions\nare implemented in the form of symmetric as well as periodic paddings. A priori\nsimulations are performed with the trained deep learning models to check the\naccuracy of turbulence statistics produced. It is found that the use of\nconvolutional long short-term memory layers in the latent space improved the\nquality of statistics, although issues related to stability for longer times\nare observed.

In this paper, we develop novel CNN architectures to\naddress both challenges. First, we present a re-ID CNN termed omni-scale\nnetwork (OSNet) to learn features that not only capture different spatial\nscales but also encapsulate a synergistic combination of multiple scales,\nnamely omni-scale features. The basic building block consists of multiple\nconvolutional streams, each detecting features at a certain scale. For\nomni-scale feature learning, a unified aggregation gate is introduced to\ndynamically fuse multi-scale features with channel-wise weights. OSNet is\nlightweight as its building blocks comprise factorised convolutions. Second, to\nimprove generalisable feature learning, we introduce instance normalisation\n(IN) layers into OSNet to cope with cross-dataset discrepancies. Further, to\ndetermine the optimal placements of these IN layers in the architecture, we\nformulate an efficient differentiable architecture search algorithm. Extensive\nexperiments show that, in the conventional same-dataset setting, OSNet achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, despite being much smaller than existing re-ID\nmodels. In the more challenging yet practical cross-dataset setting, OSNet\nbeats most recent unsupervised domain adaptation methods without using any\ntarget data.

One key\nenabling factor for their great performance has been the ability to train very\ndeep networks. Despite their huge success in many tasks, CNNs do not work well\nwith non-Euclidean data, which is prevalent in many real-world applications.\nGraph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer an alternative that allows for\nnon-Eucledian data input to a neural network. While GCNs already achieve\nencouraging results, they are currently limited to architectures with a\nrelatively small number of layers, primarily due to vanishing gradients during\ntraining. This work transfers concepts such as residual/dense connections and\ndilated convolutions from CNNs to GCNs in order to successfully train very deep\nGCNs. We show the benefit of using deep GCNs (with as many as 112 layers)\nexperimentally across various datasets and tasks. Specifically, we achieve very\npromising performance in part segmentation and semantic segmentation on point\nclouds and in node classification of protein functions across biological\nprotein-protein interaction (PPI) graphs.

Unlike Bayesian neural nets indirectly infering uncertainty through\nweight uncertainties, evidential neural networks (ENNs) have been recently\nproposed to support explicit modeling of the uncertainty of class\nprobabilities. It treats predictions of an NN as subjective opinions and learns\nthe function by collecting the evidence leading to these opinions by a\ndeterministic NN from data. However, an ENN is trained as a black box without\nexplicitly considering different types of inherent data uncertainty, such as\nvacuity (uncertainty due to a lack of evidence) or dissonance (uncertainty due\nto conflicting evidence). This paper presents a new approach, called a {\\em\nregularized ENN}, that learns an ENN based on regularizations related to\ndifferent characteristics of inherent data uncertainty. Via the experiments\nwith both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed\nregularized ENN can better learn of an ENN modeling different types of\nuncertainty in the class probabilities for classification tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 15:26:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

The total momentum and energy of\nthe outflows, corrected for optical depth, are estimated to be 1.6 x 10 2 M km\ns-1 and 1.5 x 10 46 erg, respectively. The momentum and energy ejection rate of\nthe outflows are estimated to be 36% and 235% of the momentum and energy\ndissipation rates of the cloud turbulence, respectively. Furthermore, the\nejection rates of the outflows are comparable to those of the expanding\nmolecular shells estimated by Feddersen et al. (2018, ApJ, 862, 121). Cloud\nturbulence cannot be sustained by the outflows and shells unless the energy\nconversion efficiency is as high as 20%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 08:19:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 04:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-21"}

However, constrained by the limitation of observation\nand conventional meteorological models, the numerical precipitation predictions\nare often highly biased. To correct this bias, classical correction methods\nheavily depend on profound experts who have knowledge in aerodynamics,\nthermodynamics and meteorology. As precipitation can be influenced by countless\nfactors, however, the performances of these expert-driven methods can drop\ndrastically when some un-modeled factors change. To address this issue, this\npaper presents a data-driven deep learning model which mainly includes two\nblocks, i.e. a Denoising Autoencoder Block and an Ordinal Regression Block.

In the literature,\nminimizing \"average age\" has received considerable attention. However, various\napplications pose stricter age requirements on the updates which demand\nknowledge of the AoI distribution. Furthermore, the analysis of AoI\ndistribution in a multi-hop setting, which is important for the study of\nWireless Networked Control Systems (WNCS), has not been addressed before.\nToward this end, we study the distribution of AoI in a WNCS with two hops and\ndevise a problem of minimizing the tail of the AoI distribution with respect to\nthe frequency of generating information updates, i.e., the sampling rate of\nmonitoring a process, under first-come-first-serve (FCFS) queuing discipline.\nWe argue that computing an exact expression for the AoI distribution may not\nalways be feasible; therefore, we opt for computing upper bounds on the tail of\nthe AoI distribution. Using these upper bounds we formulate Upper Bound\nMinimization Problems (UBMP), namely, Chernoff-UBMP and alpha-relaxed Upper\nBoundMinimization Problem (alpha-UBMP), where alpha > 1 is an approximation\nfactor, and solve them to obtain \"good\" heuristic rate solutions. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our approach by solving the proposed UBMPs for\nthree service distributions: geometric, exponential, and Erlang. Simulation\nresults show that the rate solutions obtained are near-optimal for minimizing\nthe tail of the AoI distribution for the considered distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 18:26:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2020 15:04:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

The following is known: (i) Liquid water can\nexist on worlds for reasons unrelated to its specific distance from a star.\n(ii) Energy sources can exist for reasons unrelated to the distance to a star.\nFurthermore, the habitable zone is based on both astronomy: the distance and\nstellar energy, and chemistry: liquid water and the right temperature. However,\nthese factors are only part of the consideration. Thus, discussions of\nhabitability and the possibility for the emergence of life on a world must\nconsider the evolutionary principles that govern life as well as the laws that\ngovern stellar and planetary science. This is important because the following\nis also known: (iii) The time window for the emergence of life is within 600\nmillion years. (iv) The Earth was an extreme environment overall in the period\nwhen this window existed. (v) The first life was necessarily fragile.\nTherefore, chemical evolution must have taken place in a relatively protected\nand restricted environment. Thus, rather than as in the Goldilocks zone, which\nfocuses too narrowly on the world as a whole, this paper suggests that it is\nbetter to focus on a particular region and time period on a world, in which\nfitting conditions for habitability exist. Thus, the following is suggested:\nThe Goldilocks Edge is a spatial and temporal window on an astronomical body or\nplanemo, where liquid solvents, SPONCH elements, and energy sources exist.\nFurthermore, since the mere presence of these do not in themselves necessarily\nlead to the emergence of life, this possibility only arises when these\ninteract.

In this work, we report high\nplasmonic quality titanium nitride (TiN) on c-plane sapphire by plasma enhanced\natomic layer deposition (PE-ALD). TiN with low losses and high metallicity was\nachieved at temperatures below 500{\\deg}C, by exploring the effects of\nchemisorption time, substrate temperature and plasma exposure time on material\nproperties. Reduction in chemisorption time mitigates premature precursor\ndecomposition at T_S > 375{\\deg}C , and a trade-off between reduced impurity\nconcentration and structural degradation caused by plasma bombardment is\nachieved for 25s plasma exposure. 85 nm thick TiN films grown at a substrate\ntemperature of 450{\\deg}C, compatible with CMOS processes, with 0.5s\nchemisorption time and 25s plasma exposure exhibited a high plasmonic figure of\nmerit (|{\\epsilon}^'/{\\epsilon}^''|) of 2.8 and resistivity of 31\n{\\mu}{\\Omega}-cm. These TiN thin films fabricated with subwavelength apertures\nwere shown to exhibit extraordinary transmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 23:35:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}
