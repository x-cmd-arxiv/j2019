It is possible that such a strong\ndecidability result cannot be pushed any further for groups sitting between\n$\\mathrm{GL}(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ and $\\mathrm{GL}(2,\\mathbb{Q})$.\n  We also show a dichotomy for nontrivial group extension of\n$\\mathrm{GL}(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ in $\\mathrm{GL}(2,\\mathbb{Q})$: if $G$ is a f.g.\ngroup such that $\\mathrm{GL}(2,\\mathbb{Z}) < G \\leq \\mathrm{GL}(2,\\mathbb{Q})$,\nthen either $G\\cong \\mathrm{GL}(2,\\mathbb{Z})\\times \\mathbb{Z}^k$, for some\n$k\\geq 1$, or $G$ contains an extension of the Baumslag-Solitar group\n$\\mathrm{BS}(1,q)$, with $q\\geq 2$, of infinite index. In the first case of the\ndichotomy the membership problem for $G$ is decidable. In the second case,\ndecidability of the membership problem for rational subsets in $G$ is open.\n  In the last part we prove new decidability results for flat rational sets\nthat contain singular matrices.

This is because at the\nfundamental level, neural network and machine learning operations extensively\nuse MVM operations and hardware compilers exploit the inherent parallelism in\nMVM operations to achieve hardware acceleration on GPUs and FPGAs. However,\nmany IoT and edge computing platforms require embedded ML devices close to the\nnetwork in order to compensate for communication cost and latency. Hence a\nnatural question to ask is whether MVM operations are even necessary to\nimplement ML algorithms and whether simpler hardware primitives can be used to\nimplement an ultra-energy-efficient ML processor/architecture. In this paper we\npropose an alternate hardware-software codesign of ML and neural network\narchitectures where instead of using MVM operations and non-linear activation\nfunctions, the architecture only uses simple addition and thresholding\noperations to implement inference and learning. At the core of the proposed\napproach is margin-propagation (MP) based computation that maps multiplications\ninto additions and additions into a dynamic rectifying-linear-unit (ReLU)\noperations.

However, most\ngeneral neural sequence models do not explicitly capture such structural\ninformation, limiting their performance on these tasks. In this paper, we\npropose a new encoder-decoder model based on a structured neural\nrepresentation, Tensor Product Representations (TPRs), for mapping\nNatural-language problems to Formal-language solutions, called TP-N2F. The\nencoder of TP-N2F employs TPR `binding' to encode natural-language symbolic\nstructure in vector space and the decoder uses TPR `unbinding' to generate, in\nsymbolic space, a sequential program represented by relational tuples, each\nconsisting of a relation (or operation) and a number of arguments.

Ambiguous\nflows are flows generated by common functionality modules, such as\nadvertisement and traffic analytics. Because such flows are common among many\ndifferent apps, identifying the source app that generates ambiguous flows is\nchallenging.

A particularly\ndamaging problem is that DNN models often give false predictions with high\nconfidence, due to the unavoidable slight divergences between operation data\nand training data. To minimize the loss caused by inaccurate confidence,\noperational calibration, i.e., calibrating the confidence function of a DNN\nclassifier against its operation domain, becomes a necessary debugging step in\nthe engineering of the whole system.\n  Operational calibration is difficult considering the limited budget of\nlabeling operation data and the weak interpretability of DNN models. We propose\na Bayesian approach to operational calibration that gradually corrects the\nconfidence given by the model under calibration with a small number of labeled\noperation data deliberately selected from a larger set of unlabeled operation\ndata. The approach is made effective and efficient by leveraging the locality\nof the learned representation of the DNN model and modeling the calibration as\nGaussian Process Regression.

The observed linear dependence of\nTc on the SFD can hardly be expected in BCS SCs while being reminiscent of Bose\nEinstein Condensation of pre-formed pairs. As additional non-BCS like\nbehaviors, responses similar to those in the bulk SC states have been observed\nat temperatures (T) well above Tc in the vortex-like Nernst effect, diamagnetic\nsusceptibility, and transient optical conductivity in photo-excitation (PEX)\nmeasurements. Here we propose a picture based on equilibrium and transient SFD\nto understand these unconventional behaviors. This picture assumes: (1) Dynamic\nSC responses in the Nernst and PEX measurements emerge at the formation of the\nlocal phase coherence (LPC) among wave functions of pre-formed pairs. (2) Its\nonset T (TLPC) is distinct from and lower than the pair-formation pseudo-gap T\n(Tstr). (3) The bulk SC Tc is reduced from TLPC, due to the competition between\nthe SC and antiferromagnetic (AF) order. (4) The magnetic resonance mode (MRM)\ncontrols Tc in the SC-AF competition. (5) The transient optical responses can\nbe attributed to a change of the balance between the competing SC and AF orders\ncaused by PEX. The assumptions (1) and (2) explain the relationship between Tc\nand the transient SFD in PEX studies and equilibrium SFD in Nernst effect.

(4)\nand (5) are consistent with the behaviors of the 400 cm-1 optical mode in\nequilibrium and PEX studies, whose intensity represents the MRM intensity.\nUnlike previous phase-fluctuation pictures which expect dynamic responses\nbetween Tstr and Tc, the present picture involving competing order indicates\nthat dynamic SC responses are seen between TLPC and Tc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Oct 2019 07:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-08"}

Amongst the various VR applications, 360{\\deg} video\nstreaming is currently one of the most popular ones. It allows user to change\ntheir field-of-view (FoV) based on head movement, which enables them to freely\nselect an area anywhere from the sphere the video is (virtually) projected to.\nWhile 360{\\deg} video streaming offers new exciting ways of consuming content\nfor viewers, it poses a series of challenges to the systems that are\nresponsible for the distribution of such content from the origin to the viewer.\nOne challenge is the significantly increased bandwidth requirement for\nstreaming such content in real time. Recent research has shown that only\nstreaming the content that is in the user's FoV in high quality can lead to\nstrong bandwidth savings. This can be achieved by analyzing the viewers head\norientation and movement based on sensor information. Alternatively, historic\ninformation from users that watched the content in the past can be taken into\naccount to prefetch 360{\\deg} video data in high quality assuming the viewer\nwill direct the FoV to these areas. In this paper, we present a 360{\\deg} video\nstreaming system that transitions between sensor- and content-based predictive\nmechanisms.

We call this architecture PointNetST and argue it is the\nsimplest permutation equivariant universal model known to date. Another\nconsequence is that DeepSets is universal, and also PointNetSeg, a popular\npoint cloud segmentation network (used eg, in [Qi et al. 2017]) is universal.\n  The key theoretical tool used to prove the above results is an explicit\ncharacterization of all permutation equivariant polynomial layers.

The central novel\ncharacteristic is the use of a bias function $V$ of the state, which biases the\nvalues of the aggregate cost function towards their correct levels. The\nclassical aggregation framework is obtained when $V\\equiv0$, but our scheme\nworks best when $V$ is a known reasonably good approximation to the optimal\ncost function $J^*$.\n  When $V$ is equal to the cost function $J_{\\mu}$ of some known policy $\\mu$\nand there is only one aggregate state, our scheme is equivalent to the rollout\nalgorithm based on $\\mu$ (i.e., the result of a single policy improvement\nstarting with the policy $\\mu$). When $V=J_{\\mu}$ and there are multiple\naggregate states, our aggregation approach can be used as a more powerful form\nof improvement of $\\mu$. Thus, when combined with an approximate policy\nevaluation scheme, our approach can form the basis for a new and enhanced form\nof approximate policy iteration.\n  When $V$ is a generic bias function, our scheme is equivalent to\napproximation in value space with lookahead function equal to $V$ plus a local\ncorrection within each aggregate state. The local correction levels are\nobtained by solving a low-dimensional aggregate DP problem, yielding an\narbitrarily close approximation to $J^*$, when the number of aggregate states\nis sufficiently large. Except for the bias function, the aggregate DP problem\nis similar to the one of the classical aggregation framework, and its\nalgorithmic solution by simulation or other methods is nearly identical to one\nfor classical aggregation, assuming values of $V$ are available when needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Oct 2019 11:51:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-08"}

In this work, we study shared account cross-domain sequential\nrecommendation and propose Parallel Split-Join Network (PSJNet), a parallel\nmodeling network to address the two challenges above. We present two variants\nof PSJNet, PSJNet-I and PSJNet-II. PSJNet-I is a \"split-by-join\" framework that\nsplits the mixed representations to get role-specific representations and joins\nthem to obtain cross-domain representations at each timestamp simultaneously.\nPSJNet-II is a \"split-and-join\" framework that first splits role-specific\nrepresentations at each timestamp, and then the representations from all\ntimestamps and all roles are joined to obtain cross-domain representations. We\nuse two datasets to assess the effectiveness of PSJNet. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that PSJNet outperforms state-of-the-art sequential\nrecommendation baselines in terms of MRR and Recall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Oct 2019 13:35:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 10:25:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 09:48:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 02:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

The $BV$ photometry revealed a high-opacity layer in the\natmospheres. When the temperature rises the mass loss increases as well,\nconsequently, as the density of the high-opacity layer. As a result, the\nabsorption in $B$ and $V$ grow. The absorption in $B$, presumably of the order\nof one to a few 0\\fm1, is always higher than in $V$. This difference renders\nredder and variable $(B-V)$ colour indexes, but the absorption law is unknown.\nThis property of YHGs is unpredictable and explains why spectroscopic\ntemperatures are always higher than photometric ones.

In this paper we tackle this task by introducing a\nnotion of temporal core decomposition where each core is associated with two\nquantities, its coreness, which quantifies how densely it is connected, and its\nspan, which is a temporal interval: we call such cores \\emph{span-cores}.\n  For a temporal network defined on a discrete temporal domain $T$, the total\nnumber of time intervals included in $T$ is quadratic in $|T|$, so that the\ntotal number of span-cores is potentially quadratic in $|T|$ as well. Our first\nmain contribution is an algorithm that, by exploiting containment properties\namong span-cores, computes all the span-cores efficiently. Then, we focus on\nthe problem of finding only the \\emph{maximal span-cores}, i.e., span-cores\nthat are not dominated by any other span-core by both their coreness property\nand their span. We devise a very efficient algorithm that exploits theoretical\nfindings on the maximality condition to directly extract the maximal ones\nwithout computing all span-cores.\n  Finally, as a third contribution, we introduce the problem of \\emph{temporal\ncommunity search}, where a set of query vertices is given as input, and the\ngoal is to find a set of densely-connected subgraphs containing the query\nvertices and covering the whole underlying temporal domain $T$. We derive a\nconnection between this problem and the problem of finding (maximal)\nspan-cores.

For this we use the ideal gas model and Newton's\nlaw of cooling combined with computational numerical simulations and systematic\nexperimental measures to confront our theoretical model, including equations\nfor the evolution of temperature, pressure and behaviour of the coins in the\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Oct 2019 23:45:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2020 20:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}
