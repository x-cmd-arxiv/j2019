In the field of\nparameterized algorithmics, the well-studied graph measure treewidth turned out\nto be a successful parameter. A well-known result by Chen in parameterized\ncomplexity is that QSAT when parameterized by the treewidth of the primal graph\nof the input formula together with the quantifier depth of the formula is\nfixed-parameter tractable. More precisely, the runtime of such an algorithm is\npolynomial in the formula size and exponential in the treewidth, where the\nexponential function in the treewidth is a tower, whose height is the\nquantifier depth. A natural question is whether one can significantly improve\nthese results and decrease the tower while assuming the Exponential Time\nHypothesis (ETH). In the last years, there has been a growing interest in the\nquest of establishing lower bounds under ETH, showing mostly problem-specific\nlower bounds up to the third level of the polynomial hierarchy. Still, an\nimportant question is to settle this as general as possible and to cover the\nwhole polynomial hierarchy. In this work, we show lower bounds based on the ETH\nfor arbitrary QBFs parameterized by treewidth (and quantifier depth). More\nformally, we establish lower bounds for QSAT and treewidth, namely, that under\nETH there cannot be an algorithm that solves QSAT of quantifier depth i in\nruntime significantly better than i-fold exponential in the treewidth and\npolynomial in the input size. In doing so, we provide a versatile reduction\ntechnique to compress treewidth that encodes the essence of dynamic programming\non arbitrary tree decompositions. Further, we describe a general methodology\nfor a more fine-grained analysis of problems parameterized by treewidth that\nare at higher levels of the polynomial hierarchy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 16:09:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 21:05:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-06"}

In particular, we consider supersymmetric\nhorizons in the low energy limit of string theory known as supergravity and we\nprove the $\\textit{horizon conjecture}$ for a number of supergravity theories.\nWe first give important examples of symmetry enhancement in $D=4$ and the\nmathematical preliminaries required for the analysis. Type IIA supergravity is\nthe low energy limit of $D=10$ IIA string theory, but also the dimensional\nreduction of $D=11$ supergravity which itself the low energy limit of M-theory.\nWe prove that Killing horizons in IIA supergravity with compact spatial\nsections preserve an even number of supersymmetries. By analyzing the global\nproperties of the Killing spinors, we prove that the near-horizon geometries\nundergo a supersymmetry enhancement. This follows from a set of generalized\nLichnerowicz-type theorems we establish, together with an index theory\nargument. We also show that the symmetry algebra of horizons with non-trivial\nfluxes includes an $\\mathfrak{sl}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ subalgebra. As an\nintermediate step in the proof, we also demonstrate new Lichnerowicz type\ntheorems for spin bundle connections whose holonomy is contained in a general\nlinear group. We prove the same result for Roman's Massive IIA supergravity.

We deduce that, in a metric compatible\ngeometry, the requirement of covariant conservation of matter invokes torsion\nof space-time. In the Friedman model this leads to a scalar field built from\ncontortion and the metric with the property of dark energy, which transforms\nthe cosmological constant to a time-dependent function. Moreover, the\nquadratic, scale invariant Riemann-Cartan term in the CCGG Lagrangian endows\nspace-time with kinetic energy, and in the field equations adds a geometrical\ncurvature correction to Einstein gravity. Applying in the Friedman model the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM parameter set, those equations yield a cosmological field\ndepending just on one additional, dimensionless ``deformation'' parameter of\nthe theory that determines the strength of the quadratic term, viz. the\ndeviation from the Einstein-Hilbert ansatz. Moreover, the apparent curvature of\nthe universe differs from the actual curvature parameter of the metric. The\nnumerical analysis in that parameter space yields three cosmology types: (I) A\nbounce universe starting off from a finite scale followed by a steady\ninflation, (II) a singular Big Bang universe undergoing a secondary\ninflation-deceleration phase, and (III) a solution similar to standard\ncosmology but with a different temporal profile. The common feature of all\nscenarios is the graceful exit to the current dark energy era. The value of the\ndeformation parameter can be deduced by comparing theoretical calculations with\nobservations, namely with the SNeIa Hubble diagram and the deceleration\nparameter. That comparison implies a considerable admixture of scale invariant\nquadratic gravity to Einstein gravity. This theory also sheds new light on the\nresolution of the cosmological constant problem and of the Hubble tension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 17:08:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 12:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-24"}

We consider the\nproperty of having a homomorphism to a fixed edge-coloured graph $H$.

The operations we consider are vertex-deletion, edge-deletion and\nswitching (an operation that permutes the colours of the edges incident to a\ngiven vertex). Switching plays an important role in the theory of signed\ngraphs, that are 2-edge-coloured graphs whose colours are the signs $+$ and\n$-$.

We investigate the impact of two-body\ndecays of neutrinos on the neutronization burst of a core-collapse supernova --\nthe large burst of $\\nu_e$ during the first 25 ms post core-bounce. In the\nmodels we consider, the $\\nu_e$, produced mainly as a $\\nu_3\\,(\\nu_2)$ in the\nnormal (inverted) mass ordering, are allowed to decay to $\\nu_1\\,(\\nu_3)$ or\n$\\bar{\\nu}_1\\,(\\bar{\\nu}_3)$, and an almost massless scalar. These decays can\nlead to the appearance of a neutronization peak for a normal mass ordering or\nthe disappearance of the same peak for the inverted one, thereby allowing one\nmass ordering to mimic the other.

In order to\nsuppress the couplings between the dark and visible sectors, a standard\nassumption is that these two sectors communicate only through a mediator. In\nthis paper we make a simple but important observation: if the dark sector\ncontains multiple components with similar quantum numbers, then this mediator\nalso generically gives rise to dark-sector decays, with heavier dark components\ndecaying to lighter components. This in turn can even give rise to relatively\nlong dark decay chains, with each step of the decay chain also producing\nvisible matter. The visible byproducts of such mediator-induced decay chains\ncan therefore serve as a unique signature of such scenarios. In order to\nexamine this possibility more concretely, we examine a scenario in which a\nmulti-component dark sector is connected through a mediator to Standard-Model\nquarks. We then demonstrate that such a scenario gives rise to multi-jet\ncollider signatures, and we examine the properties of such jets at both the\nparton and detector levels. Within relatively large regions of parameter space,\nwe find that such multi-jet signatures are not excluded by existing monojet and\nmulti-jet searches.

We support our claim by classifying, as special cases,\nthe behaviour of M-Theory and Type IIA string theory compactifications on\nCalabi-Yau three-folds at infinite distances in Kahler moduli space. The\nanalysis comprises three parts: We first classify the possible infinite\ndistance limits in the classical Kahler moduli space of a Calabi-Yau\nthree-fold. Each such limit at finite volume is characterized by a universal\nfibration structure, for which the generic fiber shrinking in the limit is\neither an elliptic curve, a K3 surface, or an Abelian surface. In the second\npart we focus on M-Theory and investigate the nature of the towers of\nasymptotically massless states that arise from branes wrapped on the shrinking\nfibers. Depending on which of the three classes of fibrations are considered,\nwe obtain decompactification to F-Theory, or a theory with a unique\nasymptotically tensionless, weakly coupled heterotic or Type II string,\nrespectively. The latter probes a dual D-manifold which is in general\nnon-geometric. In addition to the intrinsic string excitations, towers of\nstates from M2-branes along non-contractible curves become light and correspond\nto further wrapping and winding modes of the tensionless heterotic or Type II\nstring. In the third part of the analysis, we consider Type IIA string theory\non Calabi-Yau three-folds and show that quantum effects obstruct taking finite\nvolume infinite distance limits in the Kahler moduli space.

In the\ndevelopment of the lens search algorithm, we constructed a pipeline simulating\nmulti-epoch images of lensed quasars in cadenced surveys, accounting for quasar\nvariabilities, quasar hosts, lens galaxies, and the PSF variation.

In\nradio SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) research, it is unknown a\npriori which frequency a signal is being sent at, or even if there will be any\ndrift rate at all besides motions within the solar system. Therefore a range of\npotential drift rates need to be individually searched, and a maximum drift\nrate needs to be chosen.

We investigate why some BHXBs have\nprominent IR excesses and some do not, quantified by the amplitude of the IR\nquenching or recovery over the transition from/to the hard state.

Furthermore, we see no correlation between the expected and the\nobserved IR excess for Lorentz factor 1, which is strongly supportive of\nrelativistic beaming of the IR emission, confirming that the IR excess is\nproduced by synchrotron emission in a relativistic outflow.

Two types social networks for the voters are studied: (a) the complete\ngraph of $N$ voters and, more realistically, (b) the two-clique graph with $N$\nvoters in each clique. For the complete graph, many dynamical properties are\nsoluble within an annealed-link approximation, in which a link between a news\nsource and a voter is replaced by an average link density. In this\napproximation, we show that the average consensus time grows as $N^\\alpha$,\nwith $\\alpha = p\\ell/(1-p)$. Here $p$ is the probability that a voter consults\na news source rather than a neighboring voter, and $\\ell$ is the link density\nbetween a news source and voters, so that $\\alpha$ can be greater than 1. The\npolarization time, namely, the time to reach a politically polarized state from\nan initial strong majority state, is typically much less than the consensus\ntime. For voters on the two-clique graph, either reducing the density of\ninterclique links or enhancing the influence of news sources again promotes\npolarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 20:15:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Oct 2019 19:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-27"}

The FIP-dependence of SEPs also differs from that of the solar\nwind; each has a different magnetic environment where low-FIP ions and high-FIP\nneutral atoms rise toward the corona. Two major sources generate SEPs: The\nsmall \"impulsive\" SEP events are associated with magnetic reconnection in solar\njets that produce 1000-fold enhancements from H to Pb as a function of\nmass-to-charge ratio A/Q, and also 1000-fold enhancements in 3He/4He produced\nby resonant wave-particle interactions.

Model licensing is\npromising, but requires a robust tool for owners to claim ownership of models,\ni.e. a watermark. Unfortunately, current designs have not been able to address\npiracy attacks, where third parties falsely claim model ownership by embedding\ntheir own \"pirate watermarks\" into an already-watermarked model. We observe\nthat resistance to piracy attacks is fundamentally at odds with the current use\nof incremental training to embed watermarks into models. In this work, we\npropose null embedding, a new way to build piracy-resistant watermarks into\nDNNs that can only take place at a model's initial training. A null embedding\ntakes a bit string (watermark value) as input, and builds strong dependencies\nbetween the model's normal classification accuracy and the watermark. As a\nresult, attackers cannot remove an embedded watermark via tuning or incremental\ntraining, and cannot add new pirate watermarks to already watermarked models.\nWe empirically show that our proposed watermarks achieve piracy resistance and\nother watermark properties, over a wide range of tasks and models. Finally, we\nexplore a number of adaptive counter-measures, and show our watermark remains\nrobust against a variety of model modifications, including model fine-tuning,\ncompression, and existing methods to detect/remove backdoors. Our watermarked\nmodels are also amenable to transfer learning without losing their watermark\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 21:20:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 14:48:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 21:22:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

Assuming that the teacher network is\noverparameterized, we argue that the teacher network is essentially harvesting\ndark knowledge from the data via early stopping. This can be justified by a new\nconcept, {Anisotropic Information Retrieval (AIR)}, which means that the neural\nnetwork tends to fit the informative information first and the non-informative\ninformation (including noise) later. Motivated by the recent development on\ntheoretically analyzing overparameterized neural networks, we can characterize\nAIR by the eigenspace of the Neural Tangent Kernel(NTK).

The recent rise of machine\nlearning as a powerful technique to integrate multimodality, multifidelity\ndata, and reveal correlations between intertwined phenomena presents a special\nopportunity in this regard. However, classical machine learning techniques\noften ignore the fundamental laws of physics and result in ill-posed problems\nor non-physical solutions. Multiscale modeling is a successful strategy to\nintegrate multiscale, multiphysics data and uncover mechanisms that explain the\nemergence of function. However, multiscale modeling alone often fails to\nefficiently combine large data sets from different sources and different levels\nof resolution. We show how machine learning and multiscale modeling can\ncomplement each other to create robust predictive models that integrate the\nunderlying physics to manage ill-posed problems and explore massive design\nspaces.

These models assume that a dataset is generated according to a Boltzmann\ndistribution, and the goal of the training procedure is to learn the set of\nparameters that most closely match the input data distribution. Training such\nmodels is difficult due to the intractability of traditional sampling\ntechniques, and proposals using quantum annealers for sampling hope to mitigate\nthe sampling cost. However, real physical devices will inevitably be coupled to\nthe environment, and the strength of this coupling affects the effective\ntemperature of the distributions from which a quantum annealer samples. To\ncounteract this problem, error correction schemes that can effectively reduce\nthe temperature are needed if there is to be some benefit in using quantum\nannealing for problems at a larger scale, where we might expect the effective\ntemperature of the device to not be sufficiently low. To this end, we have\napplied nested quantum annealing correction (NQAC) to do unsupervised learning\nwith a small bars and stripes dataset, and to do supervised learning with a\ncoarse-grained MNIST dataset.

The classic theoretical projection approximation that replaces all\nmicroscopic forces by a single effective force determined solely by equilibrium\npair correlations is revisited based on the projectionless dynamic theory (PDT)\nthat avoids force projection. A hybrid-PDT is formulated that explicitly\nquantifies how attractive forces induce dynamical constraints, while singular\nhard core interactions are treated based on the projection approach. Both the\neffects of interference between repulsive and attractive forces, and structural\nchanges due to attraction-induced bond formation that competes with caging, are\nincluded. Combined with the microscopic Elastically Collective Nonlinear\nLangevin Equation (ECNLE) theory of activated relaxation, the resultant\napproach appears to properly capture both the re-entrant dynamic crossover\nbehavior and the strong non-monotonic variation of the activated structural\nrelaxation time with attraction strength and range at very high volume\nfractions.

Thus, uncovering the origin and nature of such a\ndrastic dimension reduction is crucial to understanding the general\ncharacteristics of biological adaptation and evolution. Herein, we first\nformulated the dimension reduction in terms of dynamical systems theory:\nconsidering the steady growth state of cells, the reduction is represented by\nthe separation of a few large singular values of the inverse Jacobian matrix\naround a fixed point. We then examined this dimension reduction by numerical\nevolution of cells consisting of thousands of chemicals whose concentrations\ndetermine phenotype. As a result of the evolution, phenotypic changes due to\nmutations and external perturbations were found to be mainly restricted to a\none-dimensional subspace. One singular value of the inverse Jacobian matrix at\na fixed point of concentrations was significantly larger than the others. The\nmajor phenotypic changes due to mutations and external perturbations occur\nalong the corresponding left-singular vector, which leads to phenotypic\nconstraint, and fitness dominantly changes in the same direction. Once such\nphenotypic constraint is acquired, phenotypic evolution to a novel environment\ntakes advantage of this restricted phenotypic direction. This results in the\nconvergence of phenotypic pathways across genetically different strains, as is\nexperimentally observed, while accelerating further evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 04:20:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 08:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

In the presence of the signal loss, this is no\nlonger true over timescales much longer than the damping time. However, for\nsufficient parametric nonlinearity, a cat-state can exist as a transient state.\nIn this paper, we study the dynamics of the creation and decoherence of\ncat-states in degenerate parametric oscillation, both with and without the\neffect of a Kerr nonlinearity that applies to recent superconducting-circuit\nexperiments generating cat-states in microwave cavities. We determine the time\nof formation and the lifetime of a cat-state in terms of three dimensionless\nparameters $\\lambda$, $g$ and $\\chi$. These relate to the driving strength, the\nparametric nonlinearity, and the Kerr nonlinearity, respectively. We find that\nthe Kerr nonlinearity has little effect on the threshold parametric\nnonlinearity ($g>1$) required for the formation of cat-states, and does not\nsignificantly alter the decoherence time of the cat-state, but can reduce the\ntime of formation. The quality of the cat-state increases with the value $g$,\nand can also improved by the Kerr nonlinearity. To verify the existence and\nquality of the cat-state, we consider several signatures, including\ninterference fringes and negativity, and show how they can be computed. We\nsimulate a superconducting-circuit experiment using published experimental\nparameters and found good agreement with experimental results, indicating that\na nonclassical cat-like state with a small Wigner negativity is generated in\nthe experiment.

As humans are less susceptible to small\nspatial distortions, the proposed approach can produce visually more realistic\nattacks with smaller perturbations, able to deceive classifiers without\naffecting human predictions.

We find the use of spin-ellipticity radial\ntracks is valuable in identifying substructures within a galaxy, including\nembedded and counter-rotating discs, that are easily missed in unilateral\nstudies of the photometry alone. Conversely, bars are rarely apparent in the\nstellar kinematics but are readily identified on images. Consequently, we\ndistinguish the spin-ellipticity radial tracks of seven morpho-dynamical types:\nelliptical, lenticular, early spiral, late spiral, barred spiral, embedded\ndisc, and 2-sigma galaxies. The importance of probing beyond the inner radii of\ngalaxies is highlighted by the characteristics of galactic features in the\nspin-ellipticity radial tracks present at larger radii. The density of\ninformation presented through spin-ellipticity radial tracks emphasises a clear\nadvantage to representing galaxies as a track, rather than a single point, in\nspin-ellipticity parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 08:54:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2019 07:55:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

We investigate the rotational\nproperties of early massive stars by comparing the abundance patterns of EMP\nstars with rotating massive stellar models. Low metallicity 20 $M_{\\odot}$\nstellar models with initial rotation rates between 0 and $70~\\%$ of the\ncritical velocity are computed. Explosions with strong fallback are assumed.\nThe ejected material is considered to fit individually the abundance patterns\nof 272 EMP stars with $-4<$ [Fe/H] $<-3$. With increasing initial rotation, the\n[C/H], [N/H], [O/H], [Na/H], [Mg/H] and [Al/H] ratios in the massive star\nejecta are gradually increased. Among the 272 EMP stars considered, $\\sim\n40-50~\\%$ are consistent with our models.

The powerful soft-state jets in Cyg X-3 form, on average, $\\sim$50\nd later.

The subsequent formation of\nthe powerful jets occurs due to advection of the magnetic field from the donor.\nWe find this happens only above certain threshold accretion rate associated\nwith appearance of magnetically driven outflows.

Among these, Terahertz (THz) band\ncommunication seems to be a promising direction due to availability of large\nbandwidth in the electromagnetic spectrum in this frequency range, and the\nability to exploit its directional nature by directive antennas with small form\nfactors. The first step in the analysis of any communication system is the\nanalysis of the propagation channel, since it determines the fundamental\nlimitations it faces. While THz channels have been explored for indoor,\nshort-distance communications, the channels for {\\em wireless access links in\noutdoor environments} are largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the -\nto our knowledge - first set of double-directional outdoor propagation channel\nmeasurements for the THz band.

We employ\ndouble directional channel sounding using a frequency domain sounding setup\nbased on RF-over-Fiber (RFoF) extensions for measurements over 100 m distance\nin urban scenarios. An important result is the surprisingly large number of\ndirections (i.e., direction-of-arrival and direction-of-departure pairs) that\ncarry significant energy. More generally, our results suggest fundamental\nparameters that can be used in future THz Band analysis and implementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 10:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-04"}

The image\nblurring occurs as the radiation penetrates detector material in lateral\ndirection at tilted angle. However, at the photon energies used in x-ray\nmicroscopy the attenuation length of the x-rays in the detector material is\nshorter and consequently the parallax error due to the tilted angle irradiation\ncan be smaller. In these cases, the tilted angle irradiation can be beneficial\nbecause it will expand the beam projection (\"footprint\") at the detector\nsurface, improve spatial resolution and help to overcome inherent resolution\nlimit of the detector. We have performed a simulation study to investigate the\nabove trade-off between the parallax error and improved spatial resolution when\ntilted angle irradiation is used.

Such a procedure results in a discrete\nprobability distribution that maximises the likelihood among all such\ndistributions under the specified constraints (called estimating equations),\nand is an approximation to the underlying population distribution. The study of\nsuch empirical likelihood originates from the seminal work of Owen. We\ninvestigate this procedure in the setting of mis-specified (or biased)\nestimating equations, i.e. when the null hypothesis is not true. We establish\nthat the behaviour of the optimal distribution under such mis-specification\ndiffer markedly from their properties under the null, i.e. when the estimating\nequations are unbiased and correctly specified. This is manifested by certain\ndegeneracies in the optimal distribution which define the likelihood. Such\ndegeneracies are not observed under the null. Furthermore, we establish an\nanomalous behaviour of the log-likelihood based Wilks statistic, which, unlike\nunder the null, does not exhibit a chi-squared limit. In the Bayesian setting,\nwe rigorously establish the posterior consistency of procedures based on these\nideas, where instead of a parametric likelihood, an empirical likelihood is\nused to define the posterior distribution. In particular, we show that this\nposterior, as a random probability measure, rapidly converges to the delta\nmeasure at the true parameter value. A novel feature of our approach is the\ninvestigation of critical points of random functions in the context of such\nempirical likelihood. In particular, we obtain the location and the mass of the\ndegenerate optimal weights as the leading and sub-leading terms in a canonical\nexpansion of a particular critical point of a random function that is naturally\nassociated with the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 10:50:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 15:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

Then two\nparticular ways of applying the partial-lexicographic product construction will\nbe specified. The first method constructs, starting from $\\mathbb R$ (the\nadditive group of the reals) and modifying it in some way by $\\mathbb Z$'s (the\nadditive group of the integers), what we call basic group-like uninorms,\nwhereas with the second method one can modify any group-like uninorm by a basic\ngroup-like uninorm to obtain another group-like uninorm.

These leave an imprint into the temperature and\npolarisation anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The\ndifferential equation describing the primordial tensor perturbations is a\nsecond order differential equation and thus has two solutions. Canonically, the\ndecaying solution of this equation in radiation domination is dropped as it\ndiverges at early times and on superhorizon scales while it is then suppressed\nat late times. Furthermore, if there is an inflationary phase prior to the\nradiation domination phase, the amplitude of the decaying mode will also be\nhighly suppressed as it enters the radiation phase, thus its effect will be\nnegligible. In this study we remain agnostic to the early universe models\ndescribing pre-radiation domination physics and allow this mode to be present\nand see what effect it has on the CMB anisotropies. We find that the decaying\nmode, if normalised at the same time on subhorizon scales as the growing mode\nleaves an imprint on the CMB anisotropies that is identical to the growing\nmode. Contrary to expectation, on large scales both modes are poorly\nconstrained for a scale invariant spectrum, and the apparent divergence of the\ndecaying mode does not lead to a divergent physical observable. Quantitatively,\nthe decaying mode can be more constrained both from temperature and\npolarisation anisotropies. We use a model independent, non-parametric, approach\nto constrain both of these primordial tensor perturbations using the\ntemperature and polarisation anisotropies. We find that both modes are best\nconstrained at the reionisation and recombination bumps and crucially, at the\nreionisation bump the decaying mode can be distinguished from the growing mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 11:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-04"}

An electric\nfield (E-field) is required in such detectors to drift ionized electrons to the\nanode to be collected. The E-field of a TPC is often approximated to be uniform\nbetween the anode and the cathode planes. However, significant distortions can\nappear from effects such as mechanical deformations, electrode failures, or the\naccumulation of space charge generated by cosmic rays. The latter is\nparticularly relevant for detectors placed near the Earth's surface and with\nlarge drift distances and long drift time. To determine the E-field in situ, an\nultraviolet (UV) laser system is installed in the MicroBooNE experiment at\nFermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The purpose of this system is to provide\nprecise measurements of the E-field, and to make it possible to correct for 3D\nspatial distortions due to E-field non-uniformities.

As a result, we find that, since\nthe direct Urca process is forbidden, the neutron star cooling is slow with use\nof the Togashi EoS. This is because symmetry energy of Togashi EoS is lower\nthan those of other EoSs. Hence, in order to account for observed age and\nsurface temperature of isolated neutron stars (INS) with use of the Togashi\nEoS, other fast cooling processes are needed regardless of the surface\ncomposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 12:41:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2020 04:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

Recently it has been found\nthat the asymmetry can arise if Jupiter has migrated inwards by at least a few\nau during its growth. The asymmetry and the dark colors of the Trojans are\nnatural outcomes of this model, but simulations with massless unperturbed disc\nparticles led to a flat distribution of the Trojan inclinations and a final\ntotal mass that was 3-4 orders of magnitude larger than the current one. In our\nwork, we investigate the possible origin of the peculiar inclination\ndistribution of the Trojans in the scenario where Jupiter migrates inwards.

We find\nthat the secular evolution of the Trojans and Saturn do not affect the Trojan\ninclinations appreciably, nor is there any significant mass depletion. Embryos\nembedded in the swarms, in contrast, can stir the Trojan inclinations and can\nalso deplete the swarms efficiently, but it turns out that it is very difficult\nto get rid of all of the massive bodies. We propose that the disc where\nJupiter's core was forming was already excited by the presence of other embryos\ncompeting in Jupiter's core's feeding zone.

RouteNet\nleverages the ability of GNNs to learn and model graph-structured information\nand as a result, our model is able to generalize over arbitrary topologies,\nrouting schemes and traffic intensity. In our evaluation, we show that RouteNet\nis able to predict accurately the delay distribution (mean delay and jitter)\nand loss even in topologies, routing and traffic unseen in the training (worst\ncase MRE=15.4%). Also, we present several use cases where we leverage the KPI\npredictions of our GNN model to achieve efficient routing optimization and\nnetwork planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 14:26:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 17:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

In this context,\nvarious MXenes have shown magnetic properties suitable for applications in\nspintronics, yet the number of MXenes reported so far is far smaller than their\nparental MAX phases. Therefore, we have studied the structural, electronic and\nmagnetic properties of bimetallic and vacancy-ordered MXenes derived from a new\n$(V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2AlC $ MAX phase to assess whether MXene exfoliation would\nreturn stable magnetic materials. In particular, we have investigated the\nproperties of pristine and surface-functionalized $(V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2CX_2$\nbimetallic and $(V_{2/3} \\square_{1/3})_2CX2$ vacancy-ordered MXenes with X =\nO, F and OH. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that\nmodifying the MXene stoichiometry and/or MXene surface functionalization\nchanges MXene properties. After testing all possible combinations of metallic\nmotifs and functionalization, we identified $V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2CX_2$,\n$(V_{2/3}\\square_{1/3})_2CF_2$ and $(V_{2/3}\\square_{1/3})_2C(OH)_2$ as stable\nstructures. Among them, $(V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2CO_2$ MXene is predicted to be an\nFM intrinsic half-semiconductor with a remarkably high Curie temperature\n($T_C$)) of 270 K. The $(V_{2/3}Zr_{1/3})_2C(OH)_2$ MXene exhibits a rather low\nwork function (WF) (1.37 eV) and is thus a promising candidate for ultra-low\nwork function electron emitters. Conversely, the $(V_{2/3}\\square_{1/3})_2CF_2$\nMXene has a rather high WF and hence can be used as a hole injector for\nSchottky-barrier-free contact applications. Overall, our proof-of-concept study\nshows that theoretical predictions of MXene exfoliation and properties support\nfurther experimental research towards developing spintronics devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 14:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

A typical approach to obtain\noptimal policies is to first construct a loss function that is based on the\nscalarization of individual objectives, and then find the optimal policy that\nminimizes the loss. However, optimizing the scalarized (and weighted) loss does\nnot necessarily provide a guarantee of high performance on each possibly\nconflicting objective. In this paper, we propose a vector value based\nreinforcement learning approach that seeks to explicitly learn the\ninter-objective relationship and optimize multiple objectives based on the\nlearned relationship. In particular, the proposed method is to first define\nrelationship matrix, a mathematical representation of the inter-objective\nrelationship, and then create one actor and multiple critics that can co-learn\nthe relationship matrix and action selection. The proposed approach can\nquantify the inter-objective relationship via reinforcement learning when the\nimpact of one objective on another is unknown a prior. We also provide rigorous\nconvergence analysis of the proposed approach and present a quantitative\nevaluation of the approach based on two testing scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 23:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-07"}

The time dependent Vaidya metric which represents\nthe spacetime of a radiating body like star is studied in an energy dependent\ngravity's rainbow, which is a UV completion of General Relativity. In our quest\nwe have used gravitational collapse as the main tool. The focus is to probe the\nnature of singularity (black hole or naked singularity) formed out of the\ncollapsing procedure. This is achieved via a geodesic study. For our\ninvestigation we have considered two different models of $f(R)$ gravity, namely\nthe inflationary Starobinsky's model and the power law model. Our study reveals\nthe fact that naked singularity is as good a possibility as black hole as far\nas the central singularity is concerned. Via a proper fine tuning of the\ninitial data, we may realize both black hole or naked singularity as the end\nstate of the collapse. Thus this study is extremely important and relevant in\nthe light of the Cosmic Censorship hypothesis. The most important result\nderived from the study is that gravity's rainbow increases the tendency of\nformation of naked singularities. We have also deduced the conditions under\nwhich the singularity will be a strong or weak curvature singularity. Finally\nin our quest to know more about the model we have performed a thermodynamical\nstudy. Throughout the study we have obtained results which involve deviation\nfrom the classical set-up. Such deviations are expected in a quantum evolution\nand can be attributed to the quantum fluctuations that our model suffers from.\nIt is expected that this study will enhance our knowledge about quantization of\ngravity and subsequently about the illusive theory of quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 20:39:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 19:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

A possible approach to this\nkey issue in global economy is to take historical time series for nominal\ninterest rates and inflation, and to construct then real interest rates and\nfinally obtaining the resulting discount rate according to a specific\nstochastic model. Extended periods of negative real interest rates, in which\ninflation dominates over nominal rates, are commonly observed, occurring in\nmany epochs and in all countries. This feature leads us to choose a well-known\nmodel in statistical physics, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, as a basic\ndynamical tool in which real interest rates randomly fluctuate and can become\nnegative, even if they tend to revert to a positive mean value. By covering 14\ncountries over hundreds of years we suggest different scenarios and include an\nerror analysis in order to consider the impact of statistical uncertainty in\nour results. We find that only 4 of the countries have positive long-run\ndiscount rates while the other ten countries have negative rates.

We achieve the behavior by combining two tactile-based\ncontrollers: 1) Cable grip controller, where a PD controller combined with a\nleaky integrator regulates the gripping force to maintain the frictional\nsliding forces close to a suitable value; and 2) Cable pose controller, where\nan LQR controller based on a learned linear model of the cable sliding dynamics\nkeeps the cable centered and aligned on the fingertips to prevent the cable\nfrom falling from the grip. This behavior is possible by a reactive gripper\nfitted with GelSight-based high-resolution tactile sensors. The robot can\nfollow one meter of cable in random configurations within 2-3 hand regrasps,\nadapting to cables of different materials and thicknesses. We demonstrate a\nrobot grasping a headphone cable, sliding the fingers to the jack connector,\nand inserting it. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nimplementation of real-time cable following without the aid of mechanical\nfixtures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 03:11:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 03:38:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 13:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Its future relevance for solving hard optimization problems in many\nfields, including finance, logistics, production and design, is leveraged\nthrough the increasing availability of powerful computing capabilities.\nAcknowledging the existence of several literature reviews on parallel\noptimization, we did not find reviews that cover the most recent literature on\nthe parallelization of both exact and (meta)heuristic methods. However, in the\npast decade substantial advancements in parallel computing capabilities have\nbeen achieved and used by OR scholars so that an overview of modern parallel\noptimization in OR that accounts for these advancements is beneficial. Another\nissue from previous reviews results from their adoption of different foci so\nthat concepts used to describe and structure prior literature differ. This\nheterogeneity is accompanied by a lack of unifying frameworks for parallel\noptimization across methodologies, application fields and problems, and it has\nfinally led to an overall fragmented picture of what has been achieved and\nstill needs to be done in parallel optimization in OR. This review addresses\nthe aforementioned issues with three contributions: First, we suggest a new\nintegrative framework of parallel computational optimization across\noptimization problems, algorithms and application domains. The framework\nintegrates the perspectives of algorithmic design and computational\nimplementation of parallel optimization.

We conduct extensive experiments with various\ncompression rates on machine translation and language modeling, using different\ndata-sets with a shared word-embedding matrix for both embedding and vocabulary\nprojection matrices. We show that the proposed technique is simple to\nreplicate, with one fixed parameter controlling compression size, has higher\nBLEU score on translation and lower perplexity on language modeling compared to\ncomplex, difficult to tune state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 16:40:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 22:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

They also fail to exclusively cool or heat the parts of the body\n(e.g., the wrist, the feet, and the head) that influence the most a person's\nthermal comfort satisfaction. Instead, they waste energy by heating or cooling\nthe whole room. This research investigates the influence of neck-coolers on\npeople's thermal comfort perception and proposes an effective method that\ndelivers thermal comfort depending on people's heart rate variability (HRV).\nMoreover, because thermal comfort is idiosyncratic and depends on unforeseeable\ncircumstances, only person-specific thermal comfort models are adequate for\nthis task. Unfortunately, using person-specific models would be costly and\ninflexible for deployment in, e.g., a smart building because a system that uses\nperson-specific models would require collecting extensive training data from\neach person in the building. As a compromise, we devise a hybrid,\ncost-effective, yet satisfactory technique that derives a personalized\nperson-specific-like model from samples collected from a large population. For\nexample, it was possible to double the accuracy of a generic model (from 47.77%\nto 96.11%) using only 400 person-specific calibration samples. Finally, we\npropose a practical implementation of a real-time thermal comfort provision\nsystem that uses this strategy and highlighted its advantages and limitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 13:46:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 08:20:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

With the advancement in hardware and\ncomputational capabilities, the next generation of computational methods, so\ncalled meshless methods, have received significant attention. Among all\nmeshless methods, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has received major\nconsideration. The main advantage of the SPH method is to bypass the\nrequirement for a numerical grid to calculate spatial derivatives. This avoids\nsevere problems associated with mesh tangling and distortion which usually\noccur in Lagrangian analysis involving high-strain-rate events. In this study\nto better understand the effects of oxide layer, coating and diffused materials\non weldability, a novel hybrid SPH platform was developed. Then, the high-speed\nimpact between Steel/Steel, Copper/Titanium, and Aluminum/Steel were simulated.\nTo experimentally validate the numerical efforts, results were compared to\nvaporizing foil actuator welding and explosive welding tests. Good agreement\nbetween the numerical simulations and experimental results provided confidence\nin the numerical modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 17:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}
