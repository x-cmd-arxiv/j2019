To this end, we propose a\ncomputationally efficient deep evolutionary model integrated with 3D Diffusion\nHeap Maps (DHM). First, we introduce a sparse 3D DHM to assist the initial\nmodeling process under extreme pose conditions. Afterward, a simple and\neffective CNN feature is extracted and fed to Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\nfor evolutionary learning. To accelerate the model, we propose an efficient\nnetwork structure to accelerate the evolutionary learning process through a\nfactorization strategy. Extensive experiments on three popular alignment\ndatabases demonstrate the advantage of the proposed models over the\nstate-of-the-art, especially under large-pose conditions. Notably, the\ncomputational speed of our model is 6 times faster than the state-of-the-art on\nCPU and 14 times on GPU. We also discuss and analyze the limitations of our\nmodels and future research work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 16:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 15:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-04"}

A possible mechanism to explain the magnetic\nfield generation is the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, since it is able to\ntransform the kinetic energy, in a shear flow, into magnetic energy. Through\nthe present work, we investigate the linear and non linear effects produced by\nthe magnetic susceptibility in the development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability in a relativistic plasma. The magnetic field in the system is\nparallel to the flows and the susceptibility is assumed to be homogeneous,\nconstant in time, and equal in both fluids. In particular, we analyze the\ninstability in three different cases, when the fluids are diamagnetic,\nparamagnetic, and when the susceptibility is zero. We compute the dispersion\nrelation in the linear regime and found that the interface between diamagnetic\nfluids is more stable than the original case without magnetic susceptibility.\nOn the contrary, the paramagnetism makes the interface more unstable. This\nbehavior is increasingly important the higher the magnetization parameter.\nAdditionally, the interval of relativistic Mach numbers for which the interface\nis unstable grows with the magnetic susceptibility, i.e., it is larger for\nparamagnetic fluids. We check these analytical results with numerical\nsimulations, and explore the effect of the magnetic polarization in the non\nlinear regime. We found that the magnetic field is more amplified in\nparamagnetic fluids than in diamagnetic ones. Surprisingly, the effect of the\nsusceptibility in the amplification is stronger when the magnetization\nparameter is smaller. These results make the KH instability a more efficient\nand effective amplification mechanism of seed magnetic fields when considering\nthe susceptibility of matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 16:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

However, the traffic micro-simulation\naccuracy of car following models in a platoon level, especially during traffic\noscillations, still needs to be enhanced. Rather than using traditional\nindividual car following models, we proposed a new trajectory generation\napproach to generate platoon level trajectories given the first leading\nvehicle's trajectory. In this paper, we discussed the temporal and spatial\nerror propagation issue for the traditional approach by a car following block\ndiagram representation. Based on the analysis, we pointed out that error comes\nfrom the training method and the model structure. In order to fix that, we\nadopt two improvements on the basis of the traditional LSTM based car following\nmodel.

As indicated by the\nsystematic empirical experiments, the proposed novel structure could\nefficiently reduce the temporal and spatial error propagation.

A powerful test of a co-evolution scenario is to\nmeasure the relations MBH-Lhost and MBH-M* at high redshift and compare with\nlocal estimates. For this purpose, we acquired HST imaging with WFC3 of 32\nX-ray-selected broad-line AGN at 1.2<z<1.7 in deep survey fields. By applying\nstate-of-the-art tools to decompose the HST images including available ACS\ndata, we measured the host galaxy luminosity and stellar mass along with other\nproperties through the 2D model fitting. The black hole mass was determined\nusing the broad Halpha line, detected in the near-infrared with Subaru/FMOS,\nwhich potentially minimizes systematic effects using other indicators. We find\nthat the observed ratio of MBH to total M* is 2.7 times larger at z~1.5 than in\nthe local universe, while the scatter is equivalent between the two epochs. A\nnon-evolving mass ratio is consistent with the data at the 2-3 sigma confidence\nlevel when accounting for selection effects and their uncertainties. The\nrelationship between MBH-Lhost paints a similar picture. Therefore, our results\ncannot distinguish whether SMBHs and their total M* and Lhost proceed in\nlockstep or whether the growth of the former somewhat overshoots the latter,\ngiven the uncertainties. Based on a statistical estimate of the bulge-to-total\nmass fraction, the ratio MBH/M* is offset from the local value by a factor of\n~7 which is significant even accounting for selection effects. Taken together,\nthese observations are consistent with a scenario in which stellar mass is\nsubsequently transferred from an angular momentum supported component of the\ngalaxy to the pressure supported one through secular processes or minor mergers\nat a faster rate than mass accretion onto the SMBH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 00:18:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-10"}

(The\naverage projected distance of Fornax GCs is $\\langle R_{\\rm GC,Fnx}\\rangle\\sim\n1$ kpc and its effective radius is $\\sim 700$ pc.) A simpler explanation is\nthat Fornax GCs have only been modestly affected by dynamical friction, as\nexpected if clusters started orbiting at initial radii of order $\\sim 1$-$2$\nkpc, just outside Fornax's present-day half-light radius but well within the\ntidal radius imprinted by Galactic tides. This is not entirely unexpected.\nFornax GCs are significantly older and more metal-poor than most Fornax stars,\nand such populations in dSphs tend to be more spatially extended than their\nyounger and more metal-rich counterparts. Contrary to some earlier claims, our\nsimulations further suggest that GCs do not truly ``stall'' at $\\sim 0.3\\,\nr_{\\rm core}$, but rather continue decaying toward the center, albeit at\nreduced rates. We conclude that dismissing the presence of a cusp in Fornax\nbased on the spatial distribution of its GC population is unwarranted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 18:00:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 20:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

The SOC$_{T=\\infty}$ universality class is\ncharacterized by the exponent of the avalanche size distribution\n$\\tau^{T=\\infty}=1.27\\pm 0.03$, consistent with the exponent of the size\ndistribution of the Barkhausen avalanches in amorphous ferromagnets (Phys. Rev.\nL 84, 4705 (2000)). The tricritical point is characterized by its own critical\nexponents. In addition to the avalanche exponents, some other quantities like\nthe average height, the spanning avalanche probability (SAP) and the average\ncoordination number of the Ising clusters change significantly the behavior at\nthis point, and also exhibit power-law behavior in terms of $\\epsilon\\equiv\n\\frac{T-T_c}{T_c}$, defining further critical exponents. Importantly the finite\nsize analysis for the activity (number of topplings) per site shows the scaling\nbehavior with exponents $\\beta=0.19\\pm 0.02$ and $\\nu=0.75\\pm 0.05$. A similar\nbehavior is also seen for the SAP and the average avalanche height. The fractal\ndimension of the external perimeter of the two-dimensional projections of\navalanches is shown to be robust against $T$ with the numerical value\n$D_f=1.25\\pm 0.01$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 19:06:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 09:35:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

For decays, we show\nthat the brightness temperature signal, rather than flux, is a less ambiguous\nmeasure for selecting candidate objects. This is owing principally to the\nfinite beam width of telescopes which prevents one from being sensitive to the\ntotal flux from the object. With this in mind, we argue that the large\nsurface-mass-density of the galactic centre or the Virgo cluster centre offers\nthe best chance of improving current constraints on the axion-photon coupling\nvia spontaneous decays. For the neutron star case, we first carry out a\ndetailed study of mixing in magnetised plasmas. We derive transport equations\nfor the axion-photon system via a controlled gradient expansion, allowing us to\naddress inhomogeneous mass-shell constraints for arbitrary momenta. We then\nderive a non-perturbative Landau-Zener formula for the conversion probability\nvalid across the range of relativistic and non-relativistic axions and show\nthat the standard perturbative resonant conversion amplitude is a truncation of\nthis result in the non-adiabatic limit. Our treatment reveals that that\ninfalling dark matter axions typically convert non-adiabatically in\nmagnetospheres. We describe the limitations of one-dimensional mixing equations\nand explain how three-dimensional effects activate new photon polarisations,\nincluding longitudinal modes and illustrate these arguments with numerical\nsimulations in higher dimensions. We find that the bandwidth of the radio\nsignal is dominated by Doppler broadening from the relative motion of the\nneutron star with respect to the observer. Therefore, we conclude that the\nradio signal from the resonant decay is weaker than previously thought, which\nmeans one relies on local density peaks to probe weaker axion-photon couplings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 19:28:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 15:06:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 21:43:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Unlike current approaches, the\nmethod requires no assumptions, user inputs, or heuristic conventions.\nBackground: Current methods for measuring VP using CMM echocardiography do not\naccount for the spatiotemporal variation of the filling wave propagation\nvelocity. They are instead confined by empirical assumptions and user inputs\nthat significantly hinder the accuracy of VP, subsequently limiting its\nclinical utility. Methods: We evaluated three methods for measuring LV early\nfilling VP: conventional VP, the strength of propagation (VS), and VP\ndetermined from the most energetically important wave (Peak-VW), using 125\npatients (Group A) with normal filling (n=50), impaired relaxation (n=25),\npseudonormal filling (n=25) and restrictive filling (n=25), and in 69 patients\n(Group B) with normal (n=32), dilated (n=15), and hypertrophic ventricles\n(n=22). Results: Peak-VW most accurately distinguished normal left ventricles\nfrom diseased ones. Specifically, for Group A which spanned the stages of\ndiastolic function, using receiver operator characteristics (ROC) and measuring\ntheir corresponding area under the curve (AUC), the AUC for Peak-VW was 0.92,\nversus 0.62 for conventional VP, 0.63 for VS and 0.58 for intraventricular\npressure difference (IVPD). These correspond to a 50-70% improvement in\nclassification ability.

This\ninterface, together with variable stiffness actuation (VSA), enables an amputee\nto modulate the impedance of the prosthetic limb to properly match the\nrequirements of a task, while performing activities of daily living. Both the\ndesired position and stiffness references are estimated through sEMG signals\nand used to control the VSA hand prosthesis. In particular, regulation of hand\nimpedance is managed through the impedance measurements of the intact upper\narm; this control takes place naturally and automatically as the amputee\ninteracts with the environment, while position of the hand prosthesis is\nregulated intentionally by the amputee through the estimated position of the\nshoulder. The proposed approach is advantageous, since the impedance regulation\ntakes place naturally without requiring amputees' attention and diminishing\ntheir functional capability. Consequently, the proposed interface is easy to\nuse, does not require long training periods or interferes with the control of\nintact body segments. The performance of the approach is evaluated through\nhuman subject experiments where adequate estimation of references and\nindependent control of position and stiffness are demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 21:24:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

While single-shot spin detection is now a laboratory routine, the\nneed for quantum error correction in a large-scale quantum computing device\ndemands a quantum non-demolition (QND) implementation. Unlike conventional\ncounterparts, the QND spin readout imposes minimal disturbance to the probed\nspin polarization and can therefore be repeated to extinguish measurement\nerrors. However, it has remained elusive for an electron spin in silicon as it\ninvolves exquisite exposure of the system to the external circuitry for readout\nwhile maintaining the coherence and integrity of the qubit.

In this work, we present a moving target defense\nmechanism, the SlotSwapper, which uses schedule randomization techniques to\nrandomize the time slots over a hyper-period schedule, while still preserving\nall the feasibility constraints of a real-time WirelessHART network and makes\nthe schedule uncertain every hyper-period. We tested the feasibility of the\ngenerated schedules on random topologies with 100 simulated motes in Cooja\nsimulator. We use schedule entropy to measure the confidentiality of our\nalgorithm in terms of randomness in the time slots of the generated schedules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Oct 2019 05:31:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

For instance, item sales can be aggregated\ntemporally, and over groups of stores based on their location or affiliation.\nHowever, data mining and machine learning models benefit from detailed data for\npersonalized analysis and prediction.

The goal of this paper is\nto reconstruct finer-scale data from multiple coarse views, aggregated over\ndifferent (subsets of) dimensions.

A key challenge is to learn person representations robust\nto intra-class variations, as different persons can have the same attribute and\nthe same person's appearance looks different with viewpoint changes. Recent\nreID methods focus on learning discriminative features but robust to only a\nparticular factor of variations (e.g., human pose), which requires\ncorresponding supervisory signals (e.g., pose annotations). To tackle this\nproblem, we propose to disentangle identity-related and -unrelated features\nfrom person images. Identity-related features contain information useful for\nspecifying a particular person (e.g., clothing), while identity-unrelated ones\nhold other factors (e.g., human pose, scale changes). To this end, we introduce\na new generative adversarial network, dubbed \\emph{identity shuffle GAN}\n(IS-GAN), that factorizes these features using identification labels without\nany auxiliary information. We also propose an identity-shuffling technique to\nregularize the disentangled features.

Automatic\nextraction of field boundaries from satellite imagery would reduce the reliance\non manual input of these records which is time consuming and error-prone, and\nwould underpin the provision of remote products and services. The lack of\ncurrent field boundary data sets seems to indicate low uptake of existing\nmethods,presumably because of expensive image preprocessing requirements and\nlocal, often arbitrary, tuning. In this paper, we address the problem of field\nboundary extraction from satellite images as a multitask semantic segmentation\nproblem. We used ResUNet-a, a deep convolutional neural network with a fully\nconnected UNet backbone that features dilated convolutions and conditioned\ninference, to assign three labels to each pixel: 1) the probability of\nbelonging to a field; 2) the probability of being part of a boundary; and 3)\nthe distance to the closest boundary. These labels can then be combined to\nobtain closed field boundaries. Using a single composite image from Sentinel-2,\nthe model was highly accurate in mapping field extent, field boundaries, and,\nconsequently, individual fields. Replacing the monthly composite with a\nsingle-date image close to the compositing period only marginally decreased\naccuracy. We then showed in a series of experiments that our model generalised\nwell across resolutions, sensors, space and time without recalibration.\nBuilding consensus by averaging model predictions from at least four images\nacquired across the season is the key to coping with the temporal variations of\naccuracy. By minimising image preprocessing requirements and replacing local\narbitrary decisions by data-driven ones, our approach is expected to facilitate\nthe extraction of individual crop fields at scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Oct 2019 08:46:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2020 06:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

It is\nconsidered as a pixel-wise classification problem in practice, and most\nsegmentation models use a pixel-wise loss as their optimization riterion.\nHowever, the pixel-wise loss ignores the dependencies between pixels in an\nimage. Several ways to exploit the relationship between pixels have been\ninvestigated, \\eg, conditional random fields (CRF) and pixel affinity based\nmethods. Nevertheless, these methods usually require additional model branches,\nlarge extra memories, or more inference time. In this paper, we develop a\nregion mutual information (RMI) loss to model the dependencies among pixels\nmore simply and efficiently. In contrast to the pixel-wise loss which treats\nthe pixels as independent samples, RMI uses one pixel and its neighbour pixels\nto represent this pixel. Then for each pixel in an image, we get a\nmulti-dimensional point that encodes the relationship between pixels, and the\nimage is cast into a multi-dimensional distribution of these high-dimensional\npoints. The prediction and ground truth thus can achieve high order consistency\nthrough maximizing the mutual information (MI) between their multi-dimensional\ndistributions. Moreover, as the actual value of the MI is hard to calculate, we\nderive a lower bound of the MI and maximize the lower bound to maximize the\nreal value of the MI. RMI only requires a few extra computational resources in\nthe training stage, and there is no overhead during testing. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that RMI can achieve substantial and consistent\nimprovements in performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and CamVid datasets.

Existing convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN)-based building extraction methods are complained that they cannot\ndetect the tiny buildings because the spatial information of CNN feature maps\nare lost during repeated pooling operations of the CNN, and the large buildings\nstill have inaccurate segmentation edges. Moreover, features extracted by a CNN\nare always partial which restricted by the size of the respective field, and\nlarge-scale buildings with low texture are always discontinuous and holey when\nextracted. This paper proposes a novel multi attending path neural network\n(MAP-Net) for accurately extracting multiscale building footprints and precise\nboundaries. MAP-Net learns spatial localization-preserved multiscale features\nthrough a multi-parallel path in which each stage is gradually generated to\nextract high-level semantic features with fixed resolution.

In general, the complex characteristics of hyperspectral\ndata make the accurate classification of such data challenging for traditional\nmachine learning methods. In addition, hyperspectral imaging often deals with\nan inherently nonlinear relation between the captured spectral information and\nthe corresponding materials. In recent years, deep learning has been recognized\nas a powerful feature-extraction tool to effectively address nonlinear problems\nand widely used in a number of image processing tasks. Motivated by those\nsuccessful applications, deep learning has also been introduced to classify\nHSIs and demonstrated good performance. This survey paper presents a systematic\nreview of deep learning-based HSI classification literatures and compares\nseveral strategies for this topic. Specifically, we first summarize the main\nchallenges of HSI classification which cannot be effectively overcome by\ntraditional machine learning methods, and also introduce the advantages of deep\nlearning to handle these problems. Then, we build a framework which divides the\ncorresponding works into spectral-feature networks, spatial-feature networks,\nand spectral-spatial-feature networks to systematically review the recent\nachievements in deep learning-based HSI classification. In addition,\nconsidering the fact that available training samples in the remote sensing\nfield are usually very limited and training deep networks require a large\nnumber of samples, we include some strategies to improve classification\nperformance, which can provide some guidelines for future studies on this\ntopic. Finally, several representative deep learning-based classification\nmethods are conducted on real HSIs in our experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Oct 2019 11:50:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

In theory, time and space are defined by clocks synchronized as\nspecified by relations among clock readings at the transmission and reception\nof light signals; however spacetime curvature implies obstacles to this\nsynchronization. Recognizing the need to handle bits and other symbols in both\ntheory and experiment, we offer a novel theory of symbol handling, centered on\na kind of \"logical synchronization,\" distinct from the synchronization defined\nby Einstein in special relativity.\n  We present three things: (1) We show a need in physics, stemming from general\nrelativity, for physicists to make choices about what clocks to synchronize\nwith what other clocks. (2) To exploit the capacity to make choices of\nsynchronization, we provide a theory in which to express timing relations\nbetween transmitted symbols and the clock readings of the agent that receives\nthem, without relying on any global concept of \"time\". Dispensing with a global\ntime variable is a marked departure from current practice. (3) The recognition\nof unpredictability calls for more attention to behavior on the workbench of\nexperiment relative to what can be predicted on the blackboard.

In this work, we approach these two\nchallenges with a novel wavelet space VAE that uses the decoder to model the\nimages in the wavelet coefficient space. This enables the VAE to emphasize over\nhigh-frequency components within an image obtained via wavelet decomposition.\nAdditionally, by decomposing the complex function of generating\nhigh-dimensional images into inverse wavelet transformation and generation of\nwavelet coefficients, the latter becomes simpler to model by the VAE.
