Practical structures made of geometric shapes\nsuch as bars and plates typically exhibit low volume fractions with respect to\nthe volume of the design region they occupy. To maintain an accurate analysis\nand to ensure well-defined sensitivities in the geometry projection, it is\nrequired that the element size is smaller than the smallest dimension of each\ncomponent. For low-volume-fraction structures, this leads to finite element\nmeshes with very large numbers of elements. To improve the efficiency of the\nanalysis and optimization, we propose a strategy to adaptively refine the mesh\nand reduce the number of elements by having a finer mesh on the geometric\ncomponents, and a coarser mesh away from them. The refinement indicator stems\nvery naturally from the geometry projection and is thus straightforward to\nimplement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AMR method by\nperforming topology optimization for the design of minimum-compliance and\nstress-constrained structures made of bars and plates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 2019 16:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Decoding accuracy was compared between ordered data and a\ntemporally shuffled version that retains pattern based information of the data\nbut not temporal relation to assess the contribution of sequential information\nto decoding memory load. The results show that (1) decoding accuracy increases\nwith increase in the length of the EEG time series given to the LSTM for both\nordered and temporally shuffled cases, with the increase being faster for\nordered than temporally shuffled time series, and (2) according to the decoding\nweight maps, the frontal, temporal and some parietal areas are an important\nsource of sequential information based decodability. This study, to our\nknowledge, is the first study applying a LSTM-RNN approach to investigate\ntemporal dynamics in human EEG data in encoding WM load information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 2019 18:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

However, SL and its variants have exposed limitations\nin predicting uncertain opinions in real-world dynamic network data mainly in\nthree-fold: (1) a lack of scalability to deal with a large-scale network; (2)\nlimited capability to handle heterogeneous topological and temporal\ndependencies among node-level opinions; and (3) a high sensitivity with\nconflicting evidence that may generate counterintuitive opinions derived from\nthe evidence. In this work, we proposed a novel deep learning (DL)-based\ndynamic opinion inference model while node-level opinions are still formalized\nbased on SL meaning that an opinion has a dimension of uncertainty in addition\nto belief and disbelief in a binomial opinion (i.e., agree or disagree).

For\neach extreme event, we solve the quasi-geostrophic omega equation to decompose\nthis strengthening into different physical contributions. We first consider a\ndry decomposition in which latent heating is treated as an external forcing of\nupward motion. Much of the positive contribution to upward motion from\nincreased latent heating is offset by negative contributions from increases in\ndry static stability and changes in the horizontal length scale of vertical\nvelocities. However, taking changes in latent heating as given is a limitation\nwhen the aim is to understand changes in precipitation, since latent heating\nand precipitation are closely linked.

In the moist decomposition,\nchanges in moist static stability play a key role and contributions from other\nfactors such as changes in the depth of the upward motion increase in\nimportance.

While for linear functions, the changes a subject is incentivized\nto make may be clear, we prove that for many non-linear functions (e.g. neural\nnetworks, random forests), classical methods for interpreting the behavior of\nmodels (e.g. input gradients) provide poor advice to individuals on which\nactions they should take.

The loss cost is typically viewed to follow a compound\ndistribution where the summation of the severity variables is stopped by the\nfrequency variable. A challenging issue in modeling such outcome is to\naccommodate the potential dependence between the number of claims and the size\nof each individual claim. In this article, we introduce a novel regression\nframework for compound distributions that uses a copula to accommodate the\nassociation between the frequency and the severity variables, and thus allows\nfor arbitrary dependence between the two components. We further show that the\nnew model is very flexible and is easily modified to account for incomplete\ndata due to censoring or truncation. The flexibility of the proposed model is\nillustrated using both simulated and real data sets. In the analysis of\ngranular claims data from property insurance, we find substantive negative\nrelationship between the number and the size of insurance claims. In addition,\nwe demonstrate that ignoring the frequency-severity association could lead to\nbiased decision-making in insurance operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 2019 03:37:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

Several important operations that change a general phylogenetic\nnetwork have been developed in recent years, and are important for allowing\nalgorithms to move around spaces of networks; a vital ingredient in finding an\noptimal network given some biological data.

In this paper, we\npropose a new approach for elucidating the neural basis of complex behaviors\nand temporal organization of memories.

In general, this is a challenging classification problem,\nwhich is of immense interest in neuroscience.

Nonetheless, we\nare able to give stateful quantum algorithms which simulate the ideal object in\nboth settings of interest. In the case of Haar-random states, our simulator is\npolynomial-time, has negligible error, and can also simulate verification and\nreflection through the simulated state. This yields an immediate application to\nquantum money: a money scheme which is information-theoretically unforgeable\nand untraceable. In the case of Haar-random unitaries, our simulator takes\npolynomial space, but simulates both forward and inverse access with zero\nerror.\n  These results can be seen as the first significant steps in developing a\ntheory of lazy sampling for random quantum objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 2019 10:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

Previously, a linear\nbound was believed to put an upper limit on the rate-transmittance performance.\nRemarkably, the recently proposed twin-field and phase-matching quantum key\ndistribution schemes have been proven to overcome the linear bound. In\npractice, due to the intractable phase fluctuation of optical signals in\ntransmission, these schemes suffer from large error rates, which renders the\nexperimental realization extremely challenging.

With\nthe symmetry-based security proof, we can decouple the privacy from the channel\ndisturbance, and eventually remove the limitation of secure key distribution on\nbit error rates. That is, the phase-matching scheme can yield positive key\nrates even with high bit error rates up to 50%. In simulation, with typical\nexperimental parameters, the key rate is able to break the linear bound with an\nerror rate of 13%. Meanwhile, we provide a finite-data size analysis for the\nscheme, which can break the bound with a reasonable data size of $10^{12}$.\nEncouraged by high loss- and error-tolerance, we expect the approach based on\nsymmetry-protected privacy will provide a new insight to the security of\nquantum key distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 2019 12:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Under\nthose circumstances, the disadvantages of the LJ potential become relevant:\nmost important among these is that in simulations the LJ potential is always\nmodified such that it has a finite range. More seriously, there is by now a\nwhole family of different potentials that are all called Lennard-Jones 12-6,\nand that are all different - and that may have very different macroscopic\nproperties.

Consequently, techniques that resolve local structure in the electronic\npotential are crucial for a detailed understanding of electronic transport in\nrealistic devices. Recently, we have introduced a new potentiometry method\nbased on low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) that utilizes characteristic\nfeatures in the reflectivity spectra of layered materials [1]. Performing\npotentiometry experiments in LEEM has the advantage of being fast, offering a\nlarge field of view and the option to zoom in and out easily, and of being\nnon-invasive compared to scanning-probe methods. However, not all materials\nshow clear features in their reflectivity spectra. Here we, therefore, focus on\na different version of low-energy electron potentiometry (LEEP) that uses the\nmirror mode transition, i.e. the drop in electron reflectivity around zero\nelectron landing energy when they start to interact with the sample rather than\nbeing reflected in front of it. This transition is universal and sensitive to\nthe local electrostatic surface potential (either workfunction or applied\npotential). It can consequently be used to perform LEEP experiments on a\nbroader range of material compared to the method described in Ref. [1]. We\nprovide a detailed description of the experimental setup and demonstrate LEEP\non workfunction-related intrinsic potential variations on the Si(111) surface\nand for a metal-semiconductor-metal junction with an external bias applied.

Moreover, decisions of different processes have to be comparable (no two\nprocesses can decide two elements $e$ and $e'$ such that $(e \\not\\leq e') \\land\n(e' \\not\\leq e)$). It has been shown that Generalized LA (i.e., a version of LA\nproposing and deciding on sequences of values) can be used to build a\nReplicated State Machine (RSM) with commutative update operations.

Despite the advantages of these data-driven\nmodels on excellent adaptivity to high dynamics and aging equipment, they are\nusually hungry to massive labels over historical data, mostly contributed by\nhuman engineers at an extremely high cost. The label demand is now the major\nlimiting factor to modeling accuracy, hindering the fulfillment of visions for\napplications. Fortunately, domain adaptation enhances the model generalization\nby utilizing the labelled source data as well as the unlabelled target data and\nthen we can reuse the model on different domains. However, the mainstream\ndomain adaptation methods cannot achieve ideal performance on time series data,\nbecause most of them focus on static samples and even the existing time series\ndomain adaptation methods ignore the properties of time series data, such as\ntemporal causal mechanism. In this paper, we assume that causal mechanism is\ninvariant and present our Causal Mechanism Transfer Network(CMTN) for time\nseries domain adaptation. By capturing and transferring the dynamic and\ntemporal causal mechanism of multivariate time series data and alleviating the\ntime lags and different value ranges among different machines, CMTN allows the\ndata-driven models to exploit existing data and labels from similar systems,\nsuch that the resulting model on a new system is highly reliable even with very\nlimited data.
