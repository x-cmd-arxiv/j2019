In this regard, an optimum fusion of\noptical imagery and LiDAR data requires an accurate registration. This is a\ncomplex problem since a versatile solution is still missing, especially when\nconsidering the context where data are collected at different times, from\ndifferent platforms, under different acquisition configurations. This paper\npresents a coarse-to-fine registration method of aerial/satellite optical\nimagery with airborne LiDAR data acquired in such context. Firstly, a coarse\nregistration involves extracting and matching of buildings from LiDAR data and\noptical imagery. Then, a Mutual Information-based fine registration is carried\nout. It involves a super-resolution approach applied to LiDAR data, and a local\napproach of transformation model estimation. The proposed method succeeds at\novercoming the challenges associated with the aforementioned difficult context.\nConsidering the experimented airborne LiDAR (2011) and orthorectified aerial\nimagery (2016) datasets, their spatial shift is reduced by 48.15% after the\nproposed coarse registration. Moreover, the incompatibility of size and spatial\nresolution is addressed by the mentioned super-resolution. Finally, a high\naccuracy of dataset alignment is also achieved, highlighted by a 40-cm error\nbased on a check-point assessment and a 64-cm error based on a check-pair-line\nassessment. These promising results enable further research for a complete\nversatile fusion methodology between airborne LiDAR and optical imagery data in\nthis challenging context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 16:10:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 02:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

Cache managers directly impact the overall\nperformance of computer systems. They govern decisions about which objects\nshould be cached, the duration they should be cached for, and decides on which\nobjects to evict from the cache if it is full. These three decisions impact\nboth the cache hit rate and size of the storage that is needed to achieve that\ncache hit rate. An optimal cache manager will avoid unnecessary operations,\nmaximise the cache hit rate which results in fewer round trips to a slower\nbackend storage system, and minimise the size of storage needed to achieve a\nhigh hit-rate.\n  This project investigates using reinforcement learning in cache management by\ndesigning three separate agents for each of the cache manager tasks.\nFurthermore, the project investigates two advanced reinforcement learning\narchitectures for multi-decision problems: a single multi-task agent and a\nmulti-agent.

To resolve the cause of TRAPPIST-1's intermediate gravity\nindicators we speculate two avenues which might be correlated to inflate the\nradius: (1) magnetic activity or (2) tidal interactions from planets. We find\nthe M8 dwarf LHS 132 is an excellent match to TRAPPIST-1's spectral\npeculiarities along with the M9 beta dwarf 2MASS J10220489+0200477, the L1 beta\n2MASS J10224821+5825453, and the L0 beta 2MASS J23224684-3133231 which have\ndistinct kinematics making all three intriguing targets for future exoplanet\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 17:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Characterisation of the observed data: The observed 21-cm signal varies\nspatially as well as along the line-of-sight (frequency or redshift dimension)\nto provide a full three dimensional movie of the intergalactic medium in the\nearly Universe. However, we cannot perform a full pixel-by-pixel comparison\nbetween theoretical models and the observed signal. Instead, we require a\nvariety of statistical methods to average the observational data in order to be\nable to better characterise and compare the behaviour of the faint signal.\n  2. An efficient method to model the 21-cm signal: In order to interpret the\nobservations and understand the astrophysical processes responsible, we must be\nable to produce physically motivated models capable of replicating the signal.\nFurther, these must be as computationally efficient as possible in order to be\nable to realistically investigate the 21-cm signal.\n  3. A robust probabilistic framework to extract the physics: The observed\n21-cm signal is dependent on numerous physical processes, which within our\nmodels or simulations are described by many unknown parameters. Further, these\ncontain approximations in order to deal with the requisite dynamic range. We\nmust be able to characterise our ignorance in a meaningful way in order to be\ntruly able to infer the astrophysical processes of the epoch of reionisation\nand cosmic dawn.\n  In this chapter we will focus on each separately, discussing the current\nstate-of-the-art in inferring astrophysical and cosmological information from\nthe 21cm signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 17:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

The transition can be detected by\npassing vertical read current through the vdW heterostructure, encapsulated by\nbilayer of hexagonal boron nitride and sandwiched between graphite electrodes,\nwhere we find tunneling magnetoresistance of $\\simeq 240$%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 17:58:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 03:19:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

To address this need\nfor a class of problems, we introduce a novel mechanism that privatizes vectors\nbelonging to the unit simplex. Such vectors can be seen in many applications,\nsuch as privatizing a decision-making policy in a Markov decision process. We\nuse differential privacy as the underlying mathematical framework for these\ndevelopments. The introduced mechanism is a probabilistic mapping that maps a\nvector within the unit simplex to the same domain according to a Dirichlet\ndistribution. We find the mechanism well-suited for inputs within the unit\nsimplex because it always returns a privatized output that is also in the unit\nsimplex. Therefore, no further projection back onto the unit simplex is\nrequired. We verify the privacy guarantees of the mechanism for two cases,\nnamely, identity queries and average queries. In the former case, we derive\nexpressions for the differential privacy level of privatizing a single vector\nwithin the unit simplex. In the latter case, we study the mechanism for\nprivatizing the average of a collection of vectors, each of which is in the\nunit simplex. We establish a trade-off between the strength of privacy and the\nvariance of the mechanism output, and we introduce a parameter to balance the\ntrade-off between them.

Riding on the wave\nof the proliferation of sharing economy, Airbnb-like charger sharing markets\nopens the opportunity to expand the existing charging networks without\nrequiring costly and time-consuming infrastructure investments, yet the\nsuccessful design of such markets relies on innovations at the interface\nbetween game theory, mechanism design, and large scale optimization. In this\npaper, we propose a price-based iterative double auction for charger sharing\nmarkets where charger owners rent out their under-utilized chargers to the\ncharge-needing EV drivers. Charger owners and EV drivers form a two-sided\nmarket which is cleared by a price-based double auction. Chargers' locations,\navailability, and time unit costs as well as the EV drivers' time, distance\nconstraints, and preferences are considered in the allocation and scheduling\nprocess. The goal is to compute social welfare maximizing allocations which\nbenefits both charger owners and EV drivers and, in turn, ensure the continuous\ngrowth of the market. We prove that the proposed double auction is budget\nbalanced, individually rational, and that it is a weakly dominant strategy for\nEV drivers and charger owners to truthfully report their charging time\nconstraints. In addition, results from our computation study show that the\ndouble auction achieves on average 94% efficiency compared with the optimal\nsolutions and scales well to larger problem instances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 18:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

However, these relationships are either\ncompletely overlooked in information gathering or not used for threat hunting.\nIn this paper, we propose a system, called POIROT, which uses these\ncorrelations to uncover the steps of a successful attack campaign. We use\nkernel audits as a reliable source that covers all causal relations and\ninformation flows among system entities and model threat hunting as an inexact\ngraph pattern matching problem. Our technical approach is based on a novel\nsimilarity metric which assesses an alignment between a query graph constructed\nout of CTI correlations and a provenance graph constructed out of kernel audit\nlog records. We evaluate POIROT on publicly released real-world incident\nreports as well as reports of an adversarial engagement designed by DARPA,\nincluding ten distinct attack campaigns against different OS platforms such as\nLinux, FreeBSD, and Windows. Our evaluation results show that POIROT is capable\nof searching inside graphs containing millions of nodes and pinpoint the\nattacks in a few minutes, and the results serve to illustrate that CTI\ncorrelations could be used as robust and reliable artifacts for threat hunting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 18:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

Here, we address this by conducting\nretrievals on simulated JWST transmission spectra under various assumptions for\nthe degree of uncertainty in the planet's mass for a representative population\nof seven planets ranging from terrestrials to warm Neptunes to hot Jupiters.\nOnly for the cloud-free, low metallicity gas giants are we able to infer\nexoplanet mass from transmission spectroscopy alone, to ~10% accuracy. For low\nmetallicity cases (<4xSolar) we are able to accurately constrain atmospheric\nproperties without prior knowledge of the planet's mass. For all other cases\n(including terrestrial-like planets), atmospheric properties can only be\ninferred with a mass precision of better than ~50%. At this level, though, the\nwidths of the posterior distributions of the atmospheric properties are\ndominated by the uncertainties in mass. With a precision of ~20%, the widths of\nthe posterior distributions are dominated by the spectroscopic data quality.\nTherefore, as a rule-of-thumb, we recommend: a ~50% mass precision for initial\natmospheric characterization and a ~20% mass precision for more detailed\natmospheric analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 20:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

The player chooses some\nset of vertices to color, then iteratively applies a color change rule: If all\nbut one of a colored vertex's neighbors are colored, color (i.e. \"force\") the\nremaining uncolored neighbor. Generally, the goal is to find the minimum number\nof vertices to initially color such that all vertices eventually become\ncolored. Recently, equivalent formations of zero forcing have been developed in\ndifferent settings including sensor allocation to solve linear systems (K.-Lin\n2018), controllability in follower-leader dynamics (Monshizadeh-Zhang-Camlibel\n2014), and edge covering in specific hypergraphs (Brimkov-Fast-Hicks 2016).\n  While many variations of zero forcing are motivated by an associated minimum\nrank problem, these new formulations give new inspiration for new meaningful\nzero forcing variants. In our case, we study a new variation based on the\nlinear algebraic interpretation mentioned above. In particular, what if there\nis a juncture in a network that has a leak, and, hence, is unreliable to\nfacilitate solving a linear system on the network? In the context of zero\nforcing this corresponds to the following variation we call $\\ell$-forcing:\nGiven $\\ell$, find a set of vertices such that for any set of $\\ell$ vertices\nthat are unable to force, all vertices will still be colored. We compute the\n$\\ell$-forcing number for selected families of graphs including grid graphs.\nPerhaps surprisingly, we find examples where additional edges make the graph\nmore \"resilient\" to these leaks. Further, we also implement known computational\nmethods for our new leaky forcing variation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 01:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

Sequences satisfying the constraints of two\nstructures simultaneously are called bicompatible and phenotypic change,\ninduced by erroneously replicating populations of RNA sequences, is closely\nconnected to bicompatibility. Furthermore, bicompatible sequences are relevant\nfor riboswitch sequences, beacons of evolution, realizing two distinct\nphenotypes.\n  Results: We present a full loop energy model Boltzmann sampler of\nbicompatible sequences for pairs of structures. The novel dynamic programming\nalgorithm is based on a topological framework encapsulating the relations\nbetween loops.

While there\nalways exist bicompatible sequences for random structure pairs, they are less\nsuited to facilitate transitions.

It is a major challenge in theory to correctly predict from the\ndiscrete particle configuration the type of deformation resulting for a\nfinite-sized system. Considering an elastic sphere, we here present such an\napproach. The method is in principle exact, at least within the framework of\nlinear elasticity theory and for large enough interparticle distances.\nDifferent particle arrangements are considered. We find, for instance, that\nregular simple cubic configurations show elongation of the sphere along the\nmagnetization if oriented along a face or space diagonal of the cubic unit\ncell. Contrariwise, with the magnetization along the edge of the cubic unit\ncell, they contract. The opposite is true in this geometry for body- and\nface-centered configurations. Remarkably, for the latter configurations but the\nmagnetization along a face or space diagonal of the unit cell, contraction was\nobserved to revert to expansion with decreasing Poisson ratio of the elastic\nmaterial. Randomized configurations were considered as well. They show a\ntendency of elongating the sphere along the magnetization, which is more\npronounced for compressible systems.

The input is a graph where the edges are labeled with different\ntypes of opening and closing parentheses, and the reachability information is\ncomputed via paths whose parentheses are properly matched. We present new\nresults for Dyck reachability problems with applications to alias analysis and\ndata-dependence analysis. Our main contributions, that include improved upper\nbounds as well as lower bounds that establish optimality guarantees, are as\nfollows.\n  First, we consider Dyck reachability on bidirected graphs, which is the\nstandard way of performing field-sensitive points-to analysis. Given a\nbidirected graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, we present: (i)~an algorithm\nwith worst-case running time $O(m + n \\cdot \\alpha(n))$, where $\\alpha(n)$ is\nthe inverse Ackermann function, improving the previously known $O(n^2)$ time\nbound; (ii)~a matching lower bound that shows that our algorithm is optimal wrt\nto worst-case complexity; and (iii)~an optimal average-case upper bound of\n$O(m)$ time, improving the previously known $O(m \\cdot \\log n)$ bound.\n  Second, we consider the problem of context-sensitive data-dependence\nanalysis, where the task is to obtain analysis summaries of library code in the\npresence of callbacks. Our algorithm preprocesses libraries in almost linear\ntime, after which the contribution of the library in the complexity of the\nclient analysis is only linear, and only wrt the number of call sites.\n  Third, we prove that combinatorial algorithms for Dyck reachability on\ngeneral graphs with truly sub-cubic bounds cannot be obtained without obtaining\nsub-cubic combinatorial algorithms for Boolean Matrix Multiplication, which is\na long-standing open problem. We also show that the same hardness holds for\ngraphs of constant treewidth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 08:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

Both analytical and numerical\nresults show that the proposed impartial user cooperation mechanism (IUCM)\noutperforms the traditional partial cooperation mechanism in terms of outage\nprobability, diversity order and diversity-multiplexing trade-off (DMT). For\ncomparison, we further incorporate the IUCM into an orthogonal\nfrequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) framework, which is shown to\npreserve the same diversity order, while has a worse but more flexible DMT\nperformance in comparison with the IUCM in the NOMA framework. Although the\nIUCM in OFDMA has a worse outage performance, it is proved that it has the same\noptimal system outage probability with the IUCM in NOMA when the relaying\nchannel between the two users is error-free.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 08:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

Here\nwe exhibit two apparently new results. The first one is that Tsallis\ndistributions occur also in an ionic--crystal model with long--range Coulomb\nforces, which is so realistic as to reproduce in an impressively good way the\nexperimental infrared spectra. Thus such distributions may be expected to be\nactual physical features of crystals. The second result is that Tsallis\ndistributions occur in the standard short--range FPU model too, so that the\npresence of long--range interactions is not a necessary condition for Tsallis\ndistributions to occur. In fact, this is in agreement with a previous result of\nthe first author in connection with the statistics of return times for the\nclassical FPU model.

Among molecular materials, Fe(II) complexes exhibit an\nultrafast spin-state transition during which the spin state of the complex\nswitches from a low spin state (LS, S=0) to a high spin state (HS, S=2). The\nlatter process is remarkable: it takes place within ~100 fs with a quantum\nefficiency of ~100%.

Hydrodynamic escape is generally thought to be driven by the flux\nof extreme ultraviolet photons that the planet receives from its host star.\nHere, we show that the escape from planets orbiting hot stars proceeds through\na different yet complementary process: drawing its energy from the intense near\nultraviolet emission of the star that is deposited within an optically thin,\nhigh-altitude atmospheric layer of hydrogen excited into the lower state of the\nBalmer series. The ultra-hot exoplanet KELT-9b likely represents the first\nknown instance of this Balmer-driven escape. In this regime of hydrodynamic\nescape, the near ultraviolet emission from the star is more important at\ndetermining the planet mass loss than the extreme ultraviolet emission, and\nuncertainties in the latter become less critical. Further, we predict that gas\nexoplanets around hot stars may experience catastrophic mass loss when they are\nless massive than 1--2 Jupiter masses and closer-in than KELT-9b, thereby\nchallenging the paradigm that all large exoplanets are stable to atmospheric\nescape.

The numerical operations in such algorithms are generally implemented\nusing finite-precision arithmetic, either fixed- or floating-point, most of\nwhich operate least-significant digit first. This results in a fundamental\nproblem: if, after some time, the result has not converged, is this because we\nhave not run the algorithm for enough iterations or because the arithmetic in\nsome iterations was insufficiently precise? There is no easy way to answer this\nquestion, so users will often over-budget precision in the hope that the answer\nwill always be to run for a few more iterations. We propose a fundamentally new\napproach: with the appropriate arithmetic able to generate results from\nmost-significant digit first, we show that fixed compute-area hardware can be\nused to calculate an arbitrary number of algorithmic iterations to arbitrary\nprecision, with both precision and approximant index increasing in lockstep.\nConsequently, datapaths constructed following our principles demonstrate\nefficiency over their traditional arithmetic equivalents where the latter's\nprecisions are either under- or over-budgeted for the computation of a result\nto a particular accuracy.

For example, we do not use any ground truth 3D or 2D\nannotations, stereo video, and ego-motion during the training. Our approach\nfollows the general strategy of Generative Adversarial Networks, where an image\ngenerator network learns to create image samples that are realistic enough to\nfool a discriminator network into believing that they are natural images. In\ncontrast, in our approach the image generation is split into 2 stages. In the\nfirst stage a generator network outputs 3D objects. In the second, a\ndifferentiable renderer produces an image of the 3D objects from random\nviewpoints. The key observation is that a realistic 3D object should yield a\nrealistic rendering from any plausible viewpoint. Thus, by randomizing the\nchoice of the viewpoint our proposed training forces the generator network to\nlearn an interpretable 3D representation disentangled from the viewpoint.

We evaluate the performance of every\npreprocessing/network couple and we also evaluate the performance of their\nensemble. We test our approach on both a small dataset and the large IP102\ndataset. Our best ensembles reaches the state of the art accuracy on both the\nsmaller dataset (92.43%) and the IP102 dataset (61.93%), approaching the\nperformance of human experts on the smaller one. Besides, we share our MATLAB\ncode at: https://github.com/LorisNanni/.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 10:40:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 00:59:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 20:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01"}

This usually happens when the system has\nmore than two independent parameters. On the other hand, if the training set\nincludes fewer parameter samples, the greedy algorithm might produce a\nreduced-order model with large errors at the samples outside of the training\nset. We introduce a method based on a surrogate error model to efficiently\nsample the parameter domain such that the training set is adaptively updated\nstarting from a coarse set with a small number of parameter samples. A sharp a\nposteriori error estimator is evaluated on a coarse training set. Radial Basis\nFunctions are used to interpolate the error estimator over a separate fine\ntraining set. Points from the fine training set are added into the coarse\ntraining set at every iteration based on a user defined criterion. In parallel,\nparameter samples satisfying a defined tolerance are adaptively removed from\nthe coarse training set. The approach is shown to avoid high computational\ncosts by using a small training set and to provide a reduced-order model with\nguaranteed accuracy over a fine training set. Further, we show numerical\nevidence that the reduced-order model meets the defined tolerance over an\nindependently sampled test set from the parameter domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 10:53:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 07:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

To this end, ESFRI established a working group,\nwhich has proposed 21 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to monitor the progress\nof the Research Infrastructures (RIs) addressed towards their objectives. The\nRIs were then asked to assess their relevance for their institution. The paper\naims to identify the relevance of certain indicators for particular groups of\nRIs by using cluster and discriminant analysis. This could contribute to\ndevelopment of a monitoring system, tailored to particular RIs.\n  To obtain a typology of the RIs, we first performed cluster analysis of the\nRIs according to their properties, which revealed clusters of RIs with similar\ncharacteristics, based on to the domain of operation, such as food, environment\nor engineering. Then, discriminant analysis was used to study how the relevance\nof the KPIs differs among the obtained clusters. This analysis revealed that\nthe percentage of RIs correctly classified into five clusters, using the KPIs,\nis 80%. Such a high percentage indicates that there are significant differences\nin the relevance of certain indicators, depending on the ESFRI domain of the\nRI. The indicators therefore need to be adapted to the type of infrastructure.\nIt is therefore proposed that the Strategic Working Groups of ESFRI addressing\nspecific domains should be involved in the tailored development of the\nmonitoring of pan-European RIs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 11:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

They, thus, call for more pragmatic market design methodologies that\nconsider the various infrastructure complexities and their potential impact on\nthe market procedures. First, we formally define temporal fairness and then\nexplain why it is very difficult for order-matching policies to ensure it in\ncontinuous markets. Subsequently, we introduce a list of system requirements\nand evaluate existing \"fair\" market designs in various practical and\nadversarial scenarios. We conclude that they fail to retain their properties in\nthe presence of infrastructure inefficiencies and sophisticated technical\nmanipulation attacks.

In this work, we gain independent access to both\nthe spin and orbital degrees of freedom of a single atom, inciting and probing\nexcitations of each moment.

Thus, we develop a fully\nautonomous pipeline for dual-arm functional regrasping of novel familiar\nobjects, i.e., objects never seen before that belong to a known object\ncategory, e.g., spray bottles.

Usually, the bias circuit of a SiPM has a\nresistor connected in series to it, which protects the sensor from drawing too\nhigh current. This resistor introduces a voltage drop when a SiPM draws a\nsteady current, when illuminated by constant light. This reduces the actual\nSiPM bias and then its sensitivity to light. As a matter of fact, this effect\nchanges all relevant SiPM features, both electrical (i.e. breakdown voltage,\ngain, pulse amplitude, dark count rate and optical crosstalk) and optical (i.e.\nphoton detection efficiency). To correctly operate such devices, it is then\nfundamental to calibrate them under various illumination levels.\n  In this work, we focus on the large area ($\\sim$1~cm$^{2}$) hexagonal SiPM\nS10943-2832(X) produced by Hamamatsu HPK for the camera of a gamma-ray\ntelescope with 4 m-diameter mirror, called the SST-1M.

Traditionally, in the practice of\noceanographic research, it is customary to con-sider density as a dependent\nparameter, which is a function of several other parameters taken as\nindependent. Usually the following three parameters are used as the independent\nparameters: temperature, hydrostatic pressure and salinity. The issues of\ntemperature and hydrostatic pressure measuring in situ are technologically well\ndeveloped, while in the salinity measuring there are still unsolved problems.\nThis is due to the fact that salinity is such a property that it is simply\nimpossi-ble to determine directly in situ. To eliminate the problems associated\nwith measurements of sa-linity, the authors developed the special new kind\nequation. That equation of the new kind ex-press the density of sea water\nthrough independent and in situ measured parameters: temperature, hydrostatic\npressure and sound speed. The novelty of this approach is that using of the\nsound speed as the independent parameter makes it possible to exclude\nmeasurements of salinity. The authors developed two such new equations for the\ndifferent cases of using. The first new equa-tion is intended for use in\ntechnical applications and reproduces the sea water density in a wide range of\nthe aquatic environment parameters with a root mean square deviation of 0.062\nkg/m3. The second more precise new equation is intended for scientific\napplications and reproduces the sea water density in a narrower oceanographic\nrange of parameters with a root mean square devi-ation of 0.0018 kg/m3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 12:55:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

For MLEM\nreconstruction, we propose and evaluate iRDF which automatically adapts RDP\nedge preservation parameters according to local image noise and PET data\ncharacteristics. In order to distinguish between clustered noise spots and\nsmall tumors, we introduce hot-spot artifact correction. The proposed method\nwas evaluated using NEMA IQ phantom data as well as clinical patient data.\nAfter initial iRDF base parameter tuning, results showed that iRDF maintained\nsimilar image quality regardless of statistics without requiring manual\nparameter tuning, in contrast to e.g. RDP. With NEMA-IQ phantom data, local\nimage variance was reduced to ~33%, while contrast of small spheres could be\nmostly preserved compared to nonregularized OSEM. Using a quarter of the\noriginally acquired list-mode data, a noise decreased to ~22% while SUV-max has\nbeen reduced to ~75% of OSEM-based results. NEMA phantom and clinical data\nshowed improved signal-recovery-to-noise ratios, leading to an overall ~3 times\nhigher feature detectability especially in small lesions. Finally, the\nprocessed examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed hot-pixel\nartefact correction. The proposed auto-adaptive iRDF regularization\ndemonstrates high potential to reduce the burden of prior parameter tuning.

This dephasing is a major issue that limits the realizable fidelity of a\nquantum entangling gate with neutral atoms when there is a {\\it gap} time for\nthe Rydberg atom to drift freely. We find that such a dephasing can be largely\nsuppressed by using a transition in a `V'-type dual-rail configuration. The\nleft~(right) arm of this `V' represents a transition to a Rydberg state\n$|r_{1(2)}\\rangle$ with a Rabi frequency $\\Omega e^{ikz}~(\\Omega e^{-ikz})$,\nwhere $z$ is frozen without atomic drift, but changes linearly in each\nexperimental cycle. Such a configuration is equivalent to a transition between\nthe ground state and a hybrid and time-dependent Rydberg state with a Rabi\nfrequency $\\sqrt2\\Omega$, such that there is no phase error whenever the state\nreturns to the ground state. We study two applications of this method. First,\nit is possible to faithfully transfer the atomic state between a hyperfine\nground state $|1\\rangle$ and Rydberg states $|r_{1(2)}\\rangle$ with no {\\it\ngap} time between the excitation and deexcitation. Second, by adding infrared\nlaser fields to induce transition between $|r_{1(2)}\\rangle$ and a nearby\nRydberg state $|r_3\\rangle$ via a largely detuned low-lying intermediate state\nin the {\\it gap} time, the atom can keep its internal state in the Rydberg\nlevel as well as adjust the population branching in $|r_{1(2)}\\rangle$ during\nthe {\\it gap} time. This allows an almost perfect Rydberg deexcitation after\nthe {\\it gap} time, making it possible to recover a high fidelity in the\nRydberg blockade gate. The theory paves the way for high-fidelity quantum\ncontrol over neutral Rydberg atoms without cooling qubits to the motional\nground states in optical traps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 13:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

In graphene, the anomalous quantum Hall\neffect results from the Berry phase {\\gamma} = {\\pi} picked up by massless\nrelativistic electrons along cyclotron orbits and proves the existence of Dirac\ncones. Contradicting this belief, we demonstrate that the Berry phase of\ngraphene can be measured in absence of any external magnetic field. We observe\nedge dislocations in the Friedel oscillations formed at hydrogen atoms\nchemisorbed on graphene. Following Nye and Berry in describing these\ntopological defects as phase singularities of complex fields, we show that the\nnumber of additional wave-fronts in the dislocation is a real space measurement\nof the pseudo spin winding, i.e. graphene's Berry phase. Since the electronic\ndispersion can also be retrieved from Friedel oscillations, our study\nestablishes the electronic density as a powerful observable to determine both\nthe dispersion relation and topological properties of wavefunctions. This could\nhave profound consequences for the study of the band-structure topology of\nrelativistic and gapped phases in solids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 14:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

We\nconjecture that following the gradient flow towards a fixed point, which is at\ninfinite distance in the space of background metrics, is accompanied by an\ninfinite tower of states in quantum gravity. In case of the Ricci flow, this\nconjecture is in accordance with the generalized distance and AdS distance\nconjectures, which were recently discussed in the literature, but it should\nalso hold for more general background spaces. We argue that the entropy\nfunctionals of gradient flows provide a useful definition of the generalized\ndistance in the space of background fields. In particular we give evidence that\nfor the Ricci flow the distance $\\Delta$ can be defined in terms of the mean\nscalar curvature of the manifold, $\\Delta\\sim\\log \\bar R$. For a more general\ngradient flow, the distance functional also depends on the string coupling\nconstant.\n  In the second part of the paper we will apply the generalized distance\nconjecture to gravity theories with higher curvature interactions, like higher\nderivative $R^2$ and $W^2$ terms. We will show that going to the weak coupling\nlimit of the higher derivative terms corresponds to the infinite distance limit\nin metric space and hence this limit must be accompanied by an infinite tower\nof light states. For the case of the $R^2$ or $W^2$ couplings, this limit\ncorresponds to the limit of a small cosmological constant or, respectively, to\na light additional spin-two field in gravity. In general we see that the limit\nof small higher curvature couplings belongs to the swampland in quantum\ngravity, just like the limit of a small $U(1)$ gauge coupling belongs to the\nswampland as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 14:39:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:10:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 15:23:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

The degree of fragility\ncarries important implications for the functionality and processability of a\nmaterial, as well as for our fundamental understanding of the glass transition.\nHowever, the microstructural properties underlying fragility still remain\npoorly understood. Here, we explain the microstructure-fragility link in\nvitrimeric networks, a novel type of high-performance polymers with unique\nbond-swapping functionality and unusual glass-forming behavior. Our results are\ngained from coarse-grained computer simulations and first-principles\nMode-Coupling Theory (MCT) of star-polymer vitrimers. We first demonstrate that\nthe vitrimer fragility can be tuned over an unprecedentedly broad range, from\nfragile to strong and even superstrong behavior, by decreasing the bulk\ndensity. Remarkably, this entire phenomenology can be reproduced by microscopic\nMCT, thus challenging the conventional belief that existing first-principles\ntheories cannot account for non-fragile behaviors. Our MCT analysis allows us\nto rationally identify the microstructural origin of the fragile-to-superstrong\ncrossover, which is rooted in the sensitivity of the static structure factor to\ntemperature variations. On the molecular scale, this behavior stems from a\nchange in dominant length scales, switching from repulsive excluded-volume\ninteractions to intrachain attractions as the vitrimer density decreases.\nFinally, we develop a simplified schematic MCT model which corroborates our\nmicroscopically-founded conclusions and which unites our findings with earlier\nMCT studies.

Although set queries are guaranteed to yield linearly sized output\nrelations, existing solutions exhibit quadratic runtime complexity. They suffer\nfrom redundant interval comparisons and additional joins for the formation of\nlineage expressions. In this paper, we formally define the semantics of set\noperations in TP databases and study their properties. For their efficient\ncomputation, we introduce the lineage-aware temporal window, a mechanism that\ndirectly binds intervals with lineage expressions. We suggest the lineage-aware\nwindow advancer (LAWA) for producing the windows of two TP relations in\nlinearithmic time, and we implement all TP set operations based on LAWA. By\nexploiting the flexibility of lineage-aware temporal windows, we perform direct\nfiltering of irrelevant intervals and finalization of output lineage\nexpressions and thus guarantee that no additional computational cost or buffer\nspace is needed. A series of experiments over both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets show that (a) our approach has predictable performance, depending only\non the input size and not on the number of time intervals per fact or their\noverlap, and that (b) it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both\ntemporal and probabilistic databases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 15:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

Relative\npermeability and capillary pressure-saturation functions show a high\nsensitivity to wettability, which has different definitions at the continuum-\nand pore-scale. At the continuum-scale, the state of wetting is defined as\nAmott-Harvey or USBM (United States Bureau of Mines) by capillary pressure\ndrainage and imbibition cycles. At the pore-scale, the concept of contact angle\nis used, which until recently was not experimentally possible to determine\nwithin an opaque porous medium. Recent progress on measurements of pore-scale\ncontact angles by X-ray computed micro-tomography has therefore attracted\nsignificant attention in various research communities.

Joint\nsubcarrier and power allocation problems (JSPA) in NOMA are NP-hard to solve in\ngeneral. In this family of problems, we consider the weighted sum-rate (WSR)\nobjective function as it can achieve various tradeoffs between sum-rate\nperformance and user fairness. Because of JSPA's intractability, a common\napproach in the literature is to solve separately the power control and\nsubcarrier allocation (also known as user selection) problems, therefore\nachieving sub-optimal result.

The first paradigm, called the fix-perturbation\nattack, crafts adversarial samples within a given perturbation level. The\nsecond paradigm, called the zero-confidence attack, finds the smallest\nperturbation needed to cause mis-classification, also known as the margin of an\ninput feature. While the former paradigm is well-resolved, the latter is not.\nExisting zero-confidence attacks either introduce significant ap-proximation\nerrors, or are too time-consuming. We therefore propose MARGINATTACK, a\nzero-confidence attack framework that is able to compute the margin with\nimproved accuracy and efficiency. Our experiments show that MARGINATTACK is\nable to compute a smaller margin than the state-of-the-art zero-confidence\nattacks, and matches the state-of-the-art fix-perturbation at-tacks.

Using three-dimensional (3-D) forced turbulence direct\nnumerical simulation (DNS) data, subgrid models are evaluated, which predict\nthe unresolved part of quantities based on the resolved solution. For\nregression, it is shown that feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) are\nable to predict the fully-resolved scalar dissipation rate using filtered input\ndata. It was found that a combination of a large-scale quantity, such as the\nfiltered passive scalar itself, and a small-scale quantity, such as the\nfiltered energy dissipation rate, gives the best agreement with the actual DNS\ndata. Furthermore, a DL network motivated by enhanced super-resolution\ngenerative adversarial networks (ESRGANs) was used to reconstruct\nfully-resolved 3-D velocity fields from filtered velocity fields.

The proposed\nsolution comprises two kinds of heat stores: a low- or medium-grade heat store\nfor domestic hot water and space heating, and a high-grade heat store for\ncombined heat and power generation. Two cases are considered where the energy\nthat is wasted during the conversion of heat into electricity is employed to\nsatisfy either the heating demand, or both heating and cooling demands by using\na thermally-driven heat pump. We compare these solutions against a reference\ncase that relies on the consumption of grid electricity and natural gas and\nuses an electrically-driven heat pump for cooling. The results show that, under\nrelatively favourable conditions, the proposed solution that uses an\nelectrically-driven heat pump could provide electricity savings in the range of\n70-90% with a payback period of 12-15 years, plus an additional 10-20%\nreduction in the fuel consumption. Shorter payback periods, lower than 10\nyears, could be attained by using a highly efficient thermally driven heat\npump, at the expense of increasing the fuel consumption and the greenhouse gas\nemissions. Hybridising this solution with solar thermal heating could enable\nsignificant savings on the global emissions, whilst keeping a high amount of\nsavings in grid electricity (> 70 %) and a reasonably short payback period (<\n12 years).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 07:32:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-17"}

Recent progress in mid-infrared\n(MIR) femtosecond laser source development may create novel capabilities for\nmaterial processing. This is because, at high intensities required for such\nprocessing, wavelength tuning to longer wavelengths opens the pathway to a\nspecial regime of laser-solid interactions. Under these conditions, due to the\n${\\lambda}^2$ scaling, the ponderomotive energy of laser-driven electrons may\nsignificantly exceed photon energy, band gap and electron affinity and can\ndominantly drive absorption, resulting in a paradigm shift in the traditional\nconcepts of ultrafast laser-solid interactions. Irreversible high-intensity\nultrafast MIR laser-solid interactions are of primary interest in this\nconnection, but they have not been systematically studied so far. To address\nthis fundamental gap, we performed a detailed experimental investigation of\nhigh-intensity ultrafast modifications of silicon by single femtosecond MIR\npulses (${\\lambda}$ = 2.7 - 4.2 ${\\mu}$m).
