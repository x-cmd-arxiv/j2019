Following the era of investigations\nat $e^+e^-$ machines, nowadays, charmonium states are copiously produced at\nhadron colliders, that allows systematic studies of their resonance parameters,\nproduction observables and decays. Despite large production rates, many\ncharmonium states are barely studied due to the complications of their\nreconstruction against a large background level. The LHCb experiment provides a\nunique opportunity to study S-wave and P-wave charmonium states using their\ndecays to hadrons. This allows measuring production observables of $\\eta_c$ and\n$\\chi_c$ charmonium states. According to the theoretical formalism of\nNon-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD), the production observables of the same wave\ncharmonium states are linked. Hence, the LHCb measurements provide a series of\nstringent tests of NRQCD. In the framework of this thesis, the first\nmeasurement of the $\\eta_c(1S)$ differential production cross-section at\n$\\sqrt{s}=13\\,TeV$ and the most precise to date single mass measurement are\nperformed, where the $\\eta_c(1S)$ state is reconstructed via its decay to\n$p\\bar{p}$.

Accordingly, there have been several attempts in\nthe literature, of varying degree of generality, to define limit objects for\nmore complicated combinatorial structures.\n  This paper is another attempt at a workable general theory of dense limit\nobjects.

We use this\nrepresentation in a 2-step decentralized loop closure verification: first, we\ndistribute the compact semantic descriptors to determine which other robots\nmight have seen scenes with similar objects; then we query matching robots with\nthe full constellation to validate the match using geometric information. The\nproposed method requires less memory, is more interpretable than global image\ndescriptors, and could be useful for other tasks and interactions with the\nenvironment. We validate our system's performance on a TUM RGB-D SLAM sequence\nand show its benefits in terms of bandwidth requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Oct 2019 17:52:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 00:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-27"}

In the proposed\nframework, a set of multiple object hypotheses is given to an agent, which is\ninferred by an object pose estimator and subsequently spatio-temporally\nselected by a fusion function that makes use of a verification score that\ncircumvents the need of ground-truth annotations. The agent reasons about these\nhypotheses, directing its attention to the object which it is most uncertain\nabout, moving the camera towards such an object. Unlike previous works that\npropose short-sighted policies, our agent is trained in simulated scenarios\nusing reinforcement learning, attempting to learn the camera moves that produce\nthe most accurate object poses hypotheses for a given temporal and spatial\nbudget, without the need of viewpoints rendering during inference.

In this paper, we point out that\nthis constraint can be readily satisfied in D-term hybrid inflation (DHI),\nwhich is a well-motivated inflation scenario in the context of supersymmetric\ngrand unification.

The width of networks, defined as the size\nof the receptive fields and the density of the channels, has demonstrated\ncrucial importance in low-level vision tasks such as image denoising and\nrestoration. However, the limited generalization ability, due to the increased\nwidth of networks, creates a bottleneck in designing wider networks.

This technique is based on a complex\ncompression coordinate transformation in polar coordinates, and a judicious\nsubstitution of the unknown field in the artificial layer. Compared with the\nwidely-used perfectly matched layer (PML) methods, the distinctive features of\nPAL lie in that (i) it is truly exact in the sense that the PAL-solution is\nidentical to the original solution in the bounded domain reduced by the\ntruncation layer; (ii) with the substitution, the PAL-equation is free of\nsingular coefficients and the substituted unknown field is essentially\nnon-oscillatory in the layer; and (iii) the construction is valid for general\nstar-shaped domain truncation.

However, the search\nspace of all possible expressions grows exponentially with the length of the\nexpression, making it infeasible for enumeration. Genetic programming (GP) has\nbeen traditionally and commonly used in SR to search for the optimal solution,\nbut it suffers from several limitations, e.g. the difficulty in incorporating\nprior knowledge; overly-complicated output expression and reduced\ninterpretability etc. To address these issues, we propose a new method to fit\nSR under a Bayesian framework. Firstly, Bayesian model can naturally\nincorporate prior knowledge (e.g., preference of basis functions, operators and\nraw features) to improve the efficiency of fitting SR. Secondly, to improve\ninterpretability of expressions in SR, we aim to capture concise but\ninformative signals. To this end, we assume the expected signal has an additive\nstructure, i.e., a linear combination of several concise expressions, whose\ncomplexity is controlled by a well-designed prior distribution. In our setup,\neach expression is characterized by a symbolic tree, and the proposed SR model\ncould be solved by sampling symbolic trees from the posterior distribution\nusing an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Finally, compared\nwith GP, the proposed BSR(Bayesian Symbolic Regression) method saves computer\nmemory with no need to keep an updated 'genome pool'.

Interestingly, the\nprincipal component analysis exactly provides an effective way to define such a\nframe, i.e. setting the principal components as the frame axes. As the\nprincipal components have direction ambiguity caused by the sign-ambiguity of\neigenvector computation, there exist several intrinsic frames for each object.\nIn order to achieve absolute rotation invariance for a deep model, we adopt the\ncoordinates expressed in all intrinsic frames as inputs to obtain multiple\noutput features, which will be further aggregated as a final feature via a\nself-attention module. Our method is theoretically rotation-invariant and can\nbe flexibly embedded into the current network architectures. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve near state-of-the-art\nperformance on rotation-augmented dataset for ModelNet40 classification and\noutperform other models on SHREC'17 perturbed retrieval task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Oct 2019 05:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-22"}

The communication network also brings about some undesired\nissues like time-varying transmission intervals, time-varying transmission\ndelays, packet dropouts, scheduling and quantization effects, which lead to\nnon-vanishing network-induced errors and affect the tracking performances.

Currently, the lesion attribute\ndetection still remains challenging due to the extremely unbalanced class\ndistribution and insufficient samples, as well as large intraclass and low\ninterclass variations. To solve these problems, we propose a deep learning\nframework named superpixel attention network (SANet).

Secondly, we apply the SANet to capture discriminative\nfeatures and reconstruct input images. Specifically, SANet contains two sub\nmodules: superpixel average pooling and superpixel at tention module. We\nintroduce a superpixel average pooling to reformulate the superpixel\nclassification problem as a superpixel segmentation problem and a SAMis\nutilized to focus on discriminative superpixel regions and feature channels.\nFinally, we design a novel but effective loss, namely global balancing loss to\naddress the serious data imbalance in ISIC 2018 Task 2 lesion attributes\ndetection dataset.

The Beurling-Lax-Halmos Theorem states that a\nbackward shift-invariant subspace is a model space $\\mathcal{H}(\\Delta) \\equiv\nH_E^2 \\ominus \\Delta H_{E}^2$, for some inner function $\\Delta$. Our first\nquestion calls for a description of the set $F$ in $H_E^2$ such that\n$\\mathcal{H}(\\Delta)=E_F^*$, where $E_F^*$ denotes the smallest backward\nshift-invariant subspace containing the set $F$. In our pursuit of a general\nsolution to this question, we are naturally led to take into account a\ncanonical decomposition of operator-valued strong $L^2$-functions. Next, we\nask: Is every shift-invariant subspace the kernel of a (possibly unbounded)\nHankel operator? As we know, the kernel of a Hankel operator is\nshift-invariant, so the above question is equivalent to seeking a solution to\nthe equation $\\ker H_{\\Phi}^*=\\Delta H_{E^{\\prime}}^2$, where $\\Delta$ is an\ninner function satisfying $\\Delta^* \\Delta=I_{E^{\\prime}}$ almost everywhere on\nthe unit circle $\\mathbb{T}$ and $H_{\\Phi}$ denotes the Hankel operator with\nsymbol $\\Phi$. Consideration of the above question on the structure of\nshift-invariant subspaces leads us to study and coin a new notion of \"Beurling\ndegree\" for an inner function. We then establish a deep connection between the\nspectral multiplicity of the model operator and the Beurling degree of the\ncorresponding characteristic function. At the same time, we consider the notion\nof meromorphic pseudo-continuations of bounded type for operator-valued\nfunctions, and then use this notion to study the spectral multiplicity of model\noperators (truncated backward shifts) between separable complex Hilbert spaces.\nIn particular, we consider the multiplicity-free case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Oct 2019 18:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

In this paper, we present a case study on modularizing real world\ncomputationintensive tasks that investigates the impact of modularization on\nprocessing large scale image data. To that end, we synthesize image\ndata-processing patterns and propose a unified modular model for the effective\nimplementation of computation-intensive tasks on data-parallel frameworks\nconsidering reproducibility, reusability, and customization. We present various\ninsights of using the modularity model based on our experimental results from\nrunning image processing tasks on Spark and Hadoop clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Oct 2019 02:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}
