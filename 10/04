Measuring and\neliminating gerrymandering has enormous implications to sustain the backbone of\ndemocratic principles of a society. Although there is no dearth of legal briefs\ninvolving gerrymandering over many years, it is only more recently that\nmathematicians and applied computational researchers have started to\ninvestigate this topic. However, it has received relatively little attention so\nfar from the computational complexity researchers dealing with theoretical\nanalysis of computational complexity issues, such as computational hardness,\napproximability issues, etc. There could be many reasons for this, such as\ndescriptions of these problem non-CS non-math (often legal or political)\njournals that theoretical CS (TCS) people usually do not follow, or the lack of\ncoverage of these topics in TCS publication venues. One of our modest goals in\nwriting this article is to improve upon this situation by stimulating further\ninteractions between the gerrymandering and TCS researchers. To this effect,\nour main contributions are twofold: (1) we provide formalization of several\nmodels, related concepts, and corresponding problem statements using TCS\nframeworks from the descriptions of these problems as available in existing\nnon-TCS (perhaps legal) venues, and (2) we also provide computational\ncomplexity analysis of some versions of these problems, leaving other versions\nfor future research.\n  The goal of writing this article is not to have the final word on\ngerrymandering, but to introduce a series of concepts, models and problems to\nthe TCS community and to show that science of gerrymandering involves an\nintriguing set of partitioning problems involving geometric and combinatorial\noptimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 16:11:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

Alternative to depensation, modeling captures by\nnon-linear harvesting functions produces equivalent outcomes at small\nabundances, and the dynamics undergoes a bifurcation leading to population\ncollapse and recovery once catching efforts are above or below certain\nthresholds, respectively. The time that a population takes to undergo these\ntransitions has been mostly overlooked in bioeconomic contexts, though.

In\nthis paper, a novel probabilistic robust small-signal stability (PRS) framework\nis developed for a power system based on Gaussian process (GP) learning. The\nproposed PRS assessment provides a robust stability certificate for a state\nsubspace, such as that specified by the error bounds of the state estimation,\nwith a given probability. With such a PRS certificate, all inner points of the\nconcerned subspace will be stable with at least the corresponding confidence\nlevel. To this end, the behavior of the critical eigenvalue of the reduced\nJacobian with state points in a state subspace is learned using GP. The\nproposed PRS certificate along with the Subspace-based Search and\nConfidence-based Search mechanisms constitute a holistic framework catering to\nall scenarios. The proposed framework is a powerful approach to assess the\nstability under uncertainty because it does not require input uncertainty\ndistributions and other state-specific input-to-output approximations. Further,\nthe critical eigenvalue behavior in a state subspace is analyzed using an upper\nbound of the eigenvalue variations and their inferences are discussed in\ndetail.

The GNN is not aware of the locations of the\nnodes in the global structure of the graph and when the local structures\ncorresponding to different nodes are similar to each other, the convolution\nlayer maps all those nodes to similar or same feature vectors in the continuous\nfeature space. Therefore, the GNN cannot distinguish two graphs if their\ndifference is not in their local structures. In addition, when the nodes are\nnot labeled/attributed the convolution layers can fail to distinguish even\ndifferent local structures. In this paper, we propose an effective solution to\naddress this problem of the GNNs. The proposed approach leverages a spatial\nrepresentation of the graph which makes the neural network aware of the\ndifferences between the nodes and also their locations in the graph. The\nspatial representation which is equivalent to a point-cloud representation of\nthe graph is obtained by a graph embedding method. Using the proposed approach,\nthe local feature extractor of the GNN distinguishes similar local structures\nin different locations of the graph and the GNN infers the topological\nstructure of the graph from the spatial distribution of the locally extracted\nfeature vectors. Moreover, the spatial representation is utilized to simplify\nthe graph down-sampling problem.

Specifically, it is\ndifficult togenerate levels that have aesthetic appeal and are playable atthe\nsame time. Additionally, because training data usually islimited, it is\nchallenging to generate unique levels with cur-rent GANs. In this paper, we\npropose a new GAN architec-ture namedConditional Embedding Self-Attention\nGenera-tive Adversarial Network(CESAGAN) and a new bootstrap-ping training\nprocedure. The CESAGAN is a modification ofthe self-attention GAN that\nincorporates an embedding fea-ture vector input to condition the training of\nthe discriminatorand generator. This allows the network to model\nnon-localdependency between game objects, and to count objects. Ad-ditionally,\nto reduce the number of levels necessary to trainthe GAN, we propose a\nbootstrapping mechanism in whichplayable generated levels are added to the\ntraining set. Theresults demonstrate that the new approach does not only\ngen-erate a larger number of levels that are playable but also gen-erates fewer\nduplicate levels compared to a standard GAN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 17:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-04"}

In this work, we investigate the effects of the dissociation\nof molecular hydrogen and recombination of atomic hydrogen on the atmospheric\ncirculation of ultra-hot Jupiters. To do so, we incorporate these effects into\na general circulation model (GCM) for hot Jupiter atmospheres, and run a large\nsuite of models varying the incident stellar flux, rotation period, and\nstrength of frictional drag. We find that including hydrogen dissociation and\nrecombination reduces the fractional day-to-night temperature contrast of\nultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres and causes the speed of the equatorial jet to\ndecrease in simulations with fixed rotation. This is because the large energy\ninput required for hydrogen dissociation cools the dayside of the planet, and\nthe energy released due to hydrogen recombination warms the nightside. The\nresulting decrease in the day-to-night temperature contrast reduces the\nday-to-night pressure gradient that drives the circulation, resulting in weaker\nwind speeds. The results from our GCM experiments qualitatively agree with\nprevious theory which found that the fractional day-night temperature contrast\nof ultra-hot Jupiters should decrease with increasing equilibrium temperature\ndue to hydrogen dissociation and recombination. Lastly, we compute full-phase\nlight curves from our suite of GCM experiments, finding that the reduced\nday-to-night temperature contrast in ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres causes a\nsmaller phase curve amplitude. The reduction in phase curve amplitude due to\nhydrogen dissociation and recombination could explain the relatively small\nphase curve amplitudes of observed ultra-hot Jupiters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 17:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In this paper, we present a method to adjust for such mismatches\nunder ``partial shuffling\" in which a sufficiently large fraction of\n(predictors, response)-pairs are observed in their correct correspondence. The\nproposed approach is based on a pseudo-likelihood in which each term takes the\nform of a two-component mixture density.

It also provides an elegant\nglobal explanation of the cosmic history from a non-singular initial state in\nthe very early universe up to our days and further into the final de Sitter\nera. The model has no horizon problem and provides an alternative explanation\nfor the early inflation and its graceful exit, as well as a powerful mechanism\nfor generating the large entropy of the current universe. The energy-momentum\ntensor of matter is generally non-conserved in such context owing to particle\ncreation or annihilation. We analyze general thermodynamical aspects of\nparticle and entropy production in the RVM.

(2019) reported low-frequency photometric variability in 164 O-\nand B-type stars observed with K2 and TESS. They interpret these motions as\ninternal gravity waves, which could be excited stochastically by convection in\nthe cores of these stars. The detection of internal gravity waves in massive\nstars would help distinguish between massive stars with convective or radiative\ncores, determine core size, and would provide important constraints on massive\nstar structure and evolution. In this work, we study the observational\nsignature of internal gravity waves generated by core convection. We calculate\nthe \\textit{wave transfer function}, which links the internal gravity wave\namplitude at the base of the radiative zone to the surface luminosity\nvariation. This transfer function varies by many orders of magnitude for\nfrequencies $\\lesssim 1 \\, {\\rm d}^{-1}$, and has regularly-spaced peaks near\n$1 \\, {\\rm d}^{-1}$ due to standing modes. This is inconsistent with the\nobserved spectra which have smooth ``red noise'' profiles, without the\npredicted regularly-spaced peaks. The wave transfer function is only meaningful\nif the waves stay predominately linear. We next show that this is the case: low\nfrequency traveling waves do not break unless their luminosity exceeds the\nradiative luminosity of the star; and, the observed luminosity fluctuations at\nhigh frequencies are so small that standing modes would be stable to nonlinear\ninstability. These simple calculations suggest that the observed low-frequency\nphotometric variability in massive stars is not due to internal gravity waves\ngenerated in the core of these stars.

Several gravitational wave models incorporate\nthe effects of small orbital eccentricities ($e \\lesssim 0.2$), but these\nmodels may not be sufficient to analyze waves from systems with moderate\neccentricity. We recently developed a gravitational wave model that faithfully\naccounts for eccentric corrections in the moderate eccentricity regime ($e\n\\lesssim 0.8$ for certain source masses) at 3rd post-Newtonian order. Here we\nconsider the data analysis implications of this particular waveform model by\nproducing and analyzing posteriors via Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.

However, real designs of\nmaterials systems involve both qualitative and quantitative design variables\nrepresenting material compositions, microstructure morphology, and processing\nconditions. For mixed-variable problems, existing Bayesian Optimization (BO)\napproaches represent qualitative factors by dummy variables first and then fit\na standard Gaussian process (GP) model with numerical variables as the\nsurrogate model. This approach is restrictive theoretically and fails to\ncapture complex correlations between qualitative levels. We present in this\npaper the integration of a novel latent-variable (LV) approach for\nmixed-variable GP modeling with the BO framework for materials design. LVGP is\na fundamentally different approach that maps qualitative design variables to\nunderlying numerical LV in GP, which has strong physical justification. It\nprovides flexible parameterization and representation of qualitative factors\nand shows superior modeling accuracy compared to the existing methods. We\ndemonstrate our approach through testing with numerical examples and materials\ndesign examples. It is found that in all test examples the mapped LVs provide\nintuitive visualization and substantial insight into the nature and effects of\nthe qualitative factors.

For the real brain to approximate gradients, gradient information\nwould have to be propagated separately, such that one set of synaptic weights\nis used for processing and another set is used for backward passes. This\nproduces the so-called \"weight transport problem\" for biological models of\nlearning, where the backward weights used to calculate gradients need to mirror\nthe forward weights used to process stimuli. This weight transport problem has\nbeen considered so hard that popular proposals for biological learning assume\nthat the backward weights are simply random, as in the feedback alignment\nalgorithm. However, such random weights do not appear to work well for large\nnetworks. Here we show how the discontinuity introduced in a spiking system can\nlead to a solution to this problem. The resulting algorithm is a special case\nof an estimator used for causal inference in econometrics, regression\ndiscontinuity design. We show empirically that this algorithm rapidly makes the\nbackward weights approximate the forward weights. As the backward weights\nbecome correct, this improves learning performance over feedback alignment on\ntasks such as Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10 and VOC. Our results demonstrate\nthat a simple learning rule in a spiking network can allow neurons to produce\nthe right backward connections and thus solve the weight transport problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 19:07:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2020 01:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

It is sometimes argued that if the CFT\nevolution shows evidence of large redshift in gravity, then we have seen black\nhole formation in the CFT. We argue that this is not the case: a clock falling\ntowards the horizon increases its redshift but remains intact as a clock; thus\nit is not `thermalized'. Instead, thermalization should correspond to a new\nphase after the phase of large redshift, where the infalling object turns into\nfuzzballs on reaching within planck distance of the horizon. We compute simple\nexamples of the scattering vertex in the D1D5 CFT which, after many iterations,\nwould lead to thermalization. An initial state made of two left-moving and two\nright-moving excitations corresponds, in gravity, to two gravitons heading\ntowards each other. The thermalization vertex in the CFT breaks these\nexcitations into multiple excitations on the left and right sides; we compute\nthe amplitudes for several of these processes.

Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars undergoing\nhot bottom burning (HBB) are thought to be prime candidates for producing\nsodium-rich oxygen-poor material and expelling it into the cluster ISM. The\n22Ne(p,gamma)23Na reaction has been shown to strongly influence the amount of\n23Na produced during HBB. This reaction is also important for classical novae\nnucleosynthesis, with sensitivity studies showing that the abundances of\nseveral isotopes in the Ne-Al region are significantly altered when varying the\nreaction rate between available compilations. Here we present the first inverse\nkinematics measurements of key resonances strengths as well as the direct\ncapture S-factor. Together, this study represents the largest centre of mass\nenergy range (149-1222 keV) over which this reaction has been measured in a\nsingle experiment. Our results for low-energy resonances at Ecm=149, 181 and\n248 keV are in good agreement with recent forward kinematics results; we also\nfind a direct capture S-factor consistent with the literature value of 62\nkeV.b.

We define two indices to capture the\ntemporal level of engagement: the Temporal Network (edge) Intensity index, and\nthe Temporal Dominance Inequality index. Our surprising results are that these\nmeasures are stationary for most measured networks, regardless of vast\nfluctuations in the size of the networks in time. Moreover, more than 80% of\nweekly changes in the indices values are bounded by less than 10%. The indices\nare stable between the temporal evolution of a network but are different\nbetween networks, and a classifier can determine the network the temporal\nindices belong to with high success. We find an exception in the Enron\nmanagement email exchange during the year before its disintegration, in which\nboth indices show high volatility throughout the inspected period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 21:12:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 19:25:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

Agents often learn to exploit the environment or reward signal and need\nto be retrained multiple times. The multi-objective reinforcement learning\n(MORL) framework separates a reward function into several objectives. An ideal\nMORL agent learns to generalize to novel combinations of objectives allowing\nfor better control of an agent's behavior without requiring retraining. Many\nMORL approaches use a weight vector to parameterize the importance of each\nobjective. However, this approach suffers from lack of expressiveness and\ninterpretability. We propose using propositional logic to specify the\nimportance of multiple objectives. By using a logic where predicates correspond\ndirectly to objectives, specifications are inherently more interpretable.\nAdditionally the set of specifications that can be expressed with formal\nlanguages is a superset of what can be expressed by weight vectors. In this\npaper, we define a formal language based on propositional logic with\nquantitative semantics. We encode logical specifications using a recurrent\nneural network and show that MORL agents parameterized by these encodings are\nable to generalize to novel specifications over objectives and achieve\nperformance comparable to single objective baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 21:16:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 16:15:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Sep 2021 19:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

We perform a multi-parameter exploration of the GALFORM semi-analytic\ngalaxy formation model, to compute how sensitive the present-day K-band\nluminosity function is to varying different model parameters. The parameter\nspace is scanned using a low-discrepancy sampling technique proposed by\nSaltelli.

The SA analysis matches our physical intuition\nregarding how these parameters affect the predictions for different parts of\nthe galaxy luminosity function. We then use SA to compute Sobol' sensitivity\nindices varying seven model parameters, connecting the variance in the model\noutput to the variance in the input parameters. The sensitivity is computed in\nluminosity bins, allowing us to probe the origin of the model predictions in\ndetail. We discover that the SA correctly identifies the least- and most\nimportant parameters. Moreover, the SA also captures the combined responses of\nvarying multiple parameters at the same time.

We compare the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) energy of\nsymmetric Pt/Co/Pt, Ir/Co/Ir multilayers and asymmetric Pt/Co/Ir, Ir/Co/Pt\nmultilayers.

First,\nwe show that: (i) {\\sc KFVD} parameterized by the size of the solution $k$ is\nW[1]-hard even when $p$, the length of a longest directed path of the input\ngraph, as well as $\\kappa$, its Kenny-width, are bounded by constants, and we\nremark that {\\sc KFVD} is para-NP-hard even considering many directed width\nmeasures as parameters, but in FPT when parameterized by clique-width; (ii)\n{\\sc KFVD} can be solved in time $2^{O(tw)}\\times n$, but assuming ETH it\ncannot be solved in $2^{o(tw)}\\times n^{O(1)}$, where $tw$ is the treewidth of\nthe underlying undirected graph. Finally, since the size of a minimum directed\nfeedback vertex set ($dfv$) is an upper bound for the size of a minimum\nknot-free vertex deletion set, we investigate parameterization by $dfv$ and we\nshow that (iii) {\\sc KFVD} can be solved in FPT-time parameterized by either\n$dfv+\\kappa$ or $dfv+p$; and it admits a Turing kernel by the distance to a DAG\nhaving an Hamiltonian path.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2019 02:21:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-07"}

Existing\nrepresentation learning methods based on graph neural networks and their\nvariants rely on the aggregation of neighborhood information, which makes it\nsensitive to noises in the graph. In this paper, we propose Graph Denoising\nPolicy Network (short for GDPNet) to learn robust representations from noisy\ngraph data through reinforcement learning. GDPNet first selects signal\nneighborhoods for each node, and then aggregates the information from the\nselected neighborhoods to learn node representations for the down-stream tasks.\nSpecifically, in the signal neighborhood selection phase, GDPNet optimizes the\nneighborhood for each target node by formulating the process of removing noisy\nneighborhoods as a Markov decision process and learning a policy with\ntask-specific rewards received from the representation learning phase. In the\nrepresentation learning phase, GDPNet aggregates features from signal neighbors\nto generate node representations for down-stream tasks, and provides\ntask-specific rewards to the signal neighbor selection phase. These two phases\nare jointly trained to select optimal sets of neighbors for target nodes with\nmaximum cumulative task-specific rewards, and to learn robust representations\nfor nodes. Experimental results on node classification task demonstrate the\neffectiveness of GDNet, outperforming the state-of-the-art graph representation\nlearning methods on several well-studied datasets. Additionally, GDPNet is\nmathematically equivalent to solving the submodular maximizing problem, which\ntheoretically guarantees the best approximation to the optimal solution with\nGDPNet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2019 02:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-07"}

Especially in recent times, research in deep learning-based object\ndetection shows promising results in various agricultural studies. However,\ntraining such systems usually requires a lot of bounding-box labeled data.\nSince crops vary by both environmental and genetic conditions, acquisition of\nhuge amount of labeled image datasets for each crop is expensive and\ntime-consuming.

Nowadays, sophisticated models often rely on hundreds or even thousands\nof input variables. Over time, structural changes such as abrupt level shifts\nor trend slope changes may occur among some of these variables, likely due to\nchanges in economy or government policies. As a part of data monitoring, it is\nimportant to identify these changepoints, in terms of which variables exhibit\nsuch changes, and what time locations do the changepoints occur. Being alerted\nabout the changepoints can help modelers decide if models need modification or\nrebuilds, while ignoring them may increase risks of model degrading. Simple\nprocess control rules often flag too many false alarms because regular seasonal\nfluctuations or steady upward or downward trends usually trigger alerts.

Here the model and the\nobservation are considered simultaneously as one large system with the state\nand the parameter as unknowns. A still more general formulation of inverse\nproblems, containing both the reduced and the all-at-once formulation, but also\nthe well-known and highly versatile so-called variational approach (also called\nKohn-Vogelius functional approach) as special cases, is to formulate the\ninverse problem as a minimization problem -- instead of an equation -- for the\nstate and parameter.

Specifically it only requires one-time training and\nenables analysis of dialectal variation at a chosen resolution post-hoc -- a\nsignificant departure from prior models which need to be re-trained whenever\nthe pre-defined set of regions changes. Furthermore, DialectGram explicitly\nmodels senses thus enabling one to estimate the proportion of each sense usage\nin any given region. Finally, we quantitatively evaluate our model against\nother baselines on a new evaluation dataset DialectSim (in English) and show\nthat DialectGram can effectively model linguistic variation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2019 07:22:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 00:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-17"}

Such networks employ randomization based autoencoders (AE) for\nunsupervised feature extraction followed by an ELM classifier for final\ndecision making. Each randomization based AE acts as an independent feature\nextractor and a deep network is obtained by stacking several such AEs. Inspired\nby the better performance of RVFL over ELM, in this paper, we propose several\ndeep RVFL variants by utilizing the framework of stacked autoencoders.\nSpecifically, we introduce direct connections (feature reuse) from preceding\nlayers to the fore layers of the network as in the original RVFL network. Such\nconnections help to regularize the randomization and also reduce the model\ncomplexity. Furthermore, we also introduce denoising criterion, recovering\nclean inputs from their corrupted versions, in the autoencoders to achieve\nbetter higher level representations than the ordinary autoencoders.

While many\nstudies have attempted to predict falls/non-falls, this study aimed to\ndetermine factors related to falls frequency in people with early PD. Ninety\nnine participants with early stage PD were assessed based on two types of\ntests. The first type of tests is disease-specific tests, comprised of the\nUnified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Schwab and England\nactivities of daily living scale (SEADL). A measure of postural instability and\ngait disorder (PIGD) and subtotal scores for subscales I, II, and III were\nderived from the UPDRS.

Falls were recorded each month for 6\nmonths.

The goal of this work is to\ncombine exploration and exploitation to improve the efficiency of the proposed\nalgorithm and obtain the optimal solution. Additionally, to combine local\nsearch algorithms with particle swarm optimization, an effective selection\nmechanism is used to select a suitable local search algorithm to combine with\nparticle swarm optimization during the search process. The results of\nexperimental simulation are compared with the well-known and successful\nmetaheuristic algorithms.

To realize this architecture, self-assembly methodology is used to\ncouple a fluorescent silica microsphere to a single silver nanowire.

Maintaining an\noptimal placement of VNFs under changing load requires a dynamic\nreconfiguration that includes adding or removing VNF instances, changing the\nresource allocation of VNFs, and re-routing corresponding service flows.\nHowever, such reconfiguration may lead to notable service disruptions and\nimpose additional overhead on the VNF infrastructure, especially when\nreconfiguration entails state or VNF migration.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the trade-off between the reconfiguration of SFCs and the\noptimality of the resulting placement and service flow (re)routing.

In\nparticular, while the existing solution by tree-packing can be strictly\nsuboptimal for the PIN model with helpers and the hypergraphical source model\nin general, we can show that decremental secret key agreement and linear\nnetwork coding is optimal, resolving a previous conjecture in the affirmative.\nThe converse is established by a single-letter upper bound on the secrecy\ncapacity for discrete memoryless multiple sources and individual discussion\nrate constraints.

For the radar\nestimation part, we derive an efficient approximated Maximum Likelihood\nalgorithm and the corresponding Cram\\'er- Rao lower bound for range and\nvelocity estimation. Numerical examples demonstrate that multi-carrier digital\nformats such as OTFS can achieve as accurate radar estimation as\nstate-of-the-art radar waveforms such as frequency-modulated continuous wave\n(FMCW).

The multigrid hierarchy exploits all\npossibilities of geometric, polynomial, and algebraic coarsening, targeting\nengineering applications on complex geometries. Additionally, a transfer from\ndiscontinuous to continuous function spaces is performed within the multigrid\nhierarchy. This does not only further reduce the problem size of the\ncoarse-grid problem, but also leads to a discretization most suitable for\nstate-of-the-art algebraic multigrid methods applied as coarse-grid solver.

The box should leave the line with the open lid\nfacing upwards with the liquid still in it. To save costs there are no complex\nsensors or image recognition software available on the assembly line, so a\nreset sequence needs to be computed. But how can the dependencies of the\ndeforming impact of a transformation of the box, such as 'do not tilt the box\nover when the lid is open' or 'open the lid again each time it gets closed' be\nmodeled? We present three attempts to model constraints of these kinds on the\norder in which the states of an automaton are transitioned by a synchronizing\nword. The first two concepts relate the last visits of states and form\nconstraints on which states still need to be reached, whereas the third concept\nconcerns the first visits of states and forms constraints on which states might\nstill be reached. We examine the computational complexity of different variants\nof the problem, whether an automaton can be synchronized with a word that\nrespects the constraints defined in the respective concept, and obtain nearly a\nfull classification. While most of the problems are PSPACE-complete we also\nobserve NP-complete variants and variants solvable in polynomial time. We will\nalso observe a drop of the complexity if we track the orders of states on\nseveral paths simultaneously instead of tracking the set of active states.\nFurther, we give upper bounds on the length of a synchronizing word depending\non the size of the input relation and show that the Cerny conjecture holds for\npartial weakly acyclic automata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2019 13:07:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 15:10:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 20:08:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 3 May 2020 17:16:01 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 13:20:32 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 10:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-18"}

HHHC is here proposed as a nonlinear vocal source\nfeature vector that represents the affective states according to their effects\non the speech production mechanism. Emotional states are highlighted by the\nempirical mode decomposition (EMD) based method, which exploits the\nnon-stationarity of the affective acoustic variations. Hurst coefficients\n(closely related to the excitation source) are then estimated from the\ndecomposition process to compose the feature vector.

New surfels can be correctly\ninitialized from the information present in nearby surfels, avoiding also the\nneed to use an expensive initialization routine commonly needed in Gauss-Newton\nmethods. The method was written in the GLSL shading language, allowing the\nusage of GPGPU thus achieving real-time. The method was tested against several\ndatasets, showing both its depth and normal estimation correctness, and its\nscene reconstruction quality. The results presented here showcase the\nusefulness of the more physically grounded piecewise planar scene depth prior,\ninstead of the more commonly pixel depth independence and smoothness prior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2019 15:40:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 13:17:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}

The goal of this calibration program\n(CAL-15400) is to mitigate these systematics by continuously illuminating the\ndetector while repeatedly reading it out during Earth occultation (termed\npre-flashing).

Primarily, thanks to the additive structure of the model, it can be\nachieved without difficulty to estimate parameters including mean. However,\ntight conditions on cumulant function, such as analyticity, strict convexity,\nand steepness, reduce the class of exponential dispersion model. In this work,\nwe present relaxed exponential dispersion model K-LED (Legendre exponential\ndispersion model with K cumulants). The cumulant function of the proposed model\nis a convex function of Legendre type having continuous partial derivatives of\nK-th order on the interior of a convex domain. Most of the K-LED models are\ndeveloped via Bregman-divergence-guided log-concave density function with\ncoercivity shape constraints. The main advantage of the proposed model is that\nthe first cumulant (or the mean parameter space) of the 1-LED model is easily\ncomputed through the extended global optimum property of Bregman divergence. An\nextended normal distribution is introduced as an example of 1-LED based on\nTweedie distribution. On top of that, we present 2-LED satisfying mean-variance\nrelation of quasi-likelihood function. There is an equivalence between a\nsubclass of quasi-likelihood function and a regular 2-LED model, of which the\ncanonical parameter space is open. A typical example is a regular 2-LED model\nwith power variance function, i.e., a variance is in proportion to the power of\nthe mean of observations. This model is equivalent to a subclass of\nbeta-divergence (or a subclass of quasi-likelihood function with power variance\nfunction). Furthermore, a new parameterized K-LED model, the cumulant function\nof which is the convex extended logistic loss function, is proposed.

The corresponding measurements are the\nnoisy magnitudes of the Fourier transform coefficients resulting from the\npointwise product of the mask and the sample.

Different from\nprevious ptychographic implementations, we employ a unit magnification\nconfiguration with a Fresnel number of ~50,000, which is orders of magnitude\nhigher than previous ptychographic setups.

While rules for choosing a penalty that guarantees a consistent\nestimate of the model order are known, theoretical tools for its design with\nfinite samples have never been provided in a general setting. In this paper, we\nstudy model order selection for finite samples under a design perspective,\nfocusing on the generalized information criterion (GIC), which embraces the\nmost common ITC.

A theoretical analysis of the standard\nIEnKF is presented and we demonstrate that the interaction between the\nnonlinearity of the forward model and the diminishing effect of the Kalman\nupdates results in \"early stopping\" of the IEnKF, i.e. the Kalman operator\nconverges to zero before the innovation is minimized. The steady state behavior\nof the early stopping phenomenon and its relation to observation uncertainty is\ndemonstrate.

To address these challenges, in this paper, we\npropose Edgent, a framework that leverages edge computing for DNN collaborative\ninference through device-edge synergy.

Specifically, in a static environment where\nthe bandwidth changes slowly, Edgent derives the best configurations with the\nassist of regression-based prediction models, while in a dynamic environment\nwhere the bandwidth varies dramatically, Edgent generates the best execution\nplan through the online change point detection algorithm that maps the current\nbandwidth state to the optimal configuration.

We\nhighlight the algorithm's benefits over prior learning methods and geometric\ndecentralized algorithms in complex scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2019 15:20:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 16:01:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 05:34:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 04:03:06 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 23:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

We study a setting where the entire network is expensive to\nobtain thoroughly or to maintain, but we can start from a seed node of interest\nand \"crawl\" the network to find other nodes through their connections. By\ncrawling the graph in a designed way, the PPR vector can be approximated\nwithout querying the entire massive graph, making it an alternative to snowball\nsampling. Using the degree-corrected stochastic block model, we study whether\nthe PPR vector can select nodes that belong to the same block as the seed node.\nWe provide a simple and interpretable form for the PPR vector, highlighting its\nbiases towards high degree nodes outside the target block. We examine a simple\nadjustment based on node degrees and establish consistency results for PPR\nclustering that allows for directed graphs. These results are enabled by recent\ntechnical advances showing the elementwise convergence of eigenvectors. We\nillustrate the method with the massive Twitter friendship graph, which we crawl\nby using the Twitter application programming interface. We find that the\nadjusted and unadjusted PPR techniques are complementary approaches, where the\nadjustment makes the results particularly localized around the seed node, and\nthat the bias adjustment greatly benefits from degree regularization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2019 01:48:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 17:07:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-02"}

Affective computing (AC) of these data can help to understand human\nbehaviors and enable wide applications. In this article, we survey the\nstate-of-the-art AC technologies comprehensively for large-scale heterogeneous\nmultimedia data. We begin this survey by introducing the typical emotion\nrepresentation models from psychology that are widely employed in AC. We\nbriefly describe the available datasets for evaluating AC algorithms. We then\nsummarize and compare the representative methods on AC of different multimedia\ntypes, i.e., images, music, videos, and multimodal data, with the focus on both\nhandcrafted features-based methods and deep learning methods. Finally, we\ndiscuss some challenges and future directions for multimedia affective\ncomputing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 21:22:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-14"}
