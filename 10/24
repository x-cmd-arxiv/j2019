The\nmain aims of this study are two-fold.

Although Krylov methods\nincorporating explicit projections onto low-rank subspaces are already used for\nwell-posed systems that arise from discretizing stochastic or time-dependent\nPDEs, we are mainly concerned with algorithms that solve the so-called nuclear\nnorm regularized problem, where a suitable nuclear norm penalization on the\nsolution is imposed alongside a fit-to-data term expressed in the 2-norm: this\nhas the effect of implicitly enforcing low-rank solutions. By adopting an\niteratively reweighted norm approach, the nuclear norm regularized problem is\nreformulated as a sequence of quadratic problems, which can then be efficiently\nsolved using Krylov methods, giving rise to an inner-outer iteration scheme.\nOur approach differs from the other solvers available in the literature in\nthat: (a) Kronecker product properties are exploited to define the reweighted\n2-norm penalization terms; (b) efficient preconditioned Krylov methods replace\ngradient (projection) methods; (c) the regularization parameter can be\nefficiently and adaptively set along the iterations. Furthermore, we\nreformulate within the framework of flexible Krylov methods both the new\ninner-outer methods for nuclear norm regularization and some of the existing\nKrylov methods incorporating low-rank projections. This results in an even more\ncomputationally efficient (but heuristic) strategy, that does not rely on an\ninner-outer iteration scheme.

These measurements can be accomplished rigorously by\nmeans of the Purely Geometric BAO methods. To date two different Purely\nGeometric BAO approaches have been proposed. The first exploits the\nlinear-point standard ruler. The second, called correlation-function\nmodel-fitting, exploits the sound-horizon standard ruler. A key difference\nbetween them is that, when estimated from clustering data, the linear point\nmakes use of a cosmological-model-independent procedure to extract the ratio of\nthe ruler to the cosmic distance, while the correlation-function model-fitting\nrelies on a phenomenological cosmological model for the correlation function.\nNevertheless the two rulers need to be precisely defined independently of any\nspecific observable. We define the linear point and sound horizon and we\ncharacterize and compare the two rulers' cosmological-parameter dependence. We\nfind that they are both geometrical within the required accuracy, and they have\nthe same parameter dependence for a wide range of parameter values. We estimate\nthe rulers' best-fit values and errors given the cosmological constraints\nobtained by the Planck Satellite team from the CMB measurements. We do this for\nthree different cosmological models encompassed by the Purely Geometric BAO\nmethods. In each case we find that the relative errors of the two rulers\ncoincide and they are insensitive to the assumed cosmological model.\nInterestingly both the linear point and the sound horizon shift by $0.5\\sigma$\nwhen we do not fix the spatial geometry to be flat in LCDM. This points toward\na sensitivity of the rulers to different cosmological models when they are\nestimated from the CMB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 17:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

An impact\noutcome prescription is used to characterise how f_v depends on planetesimal\nimpact velocities, size distribution and composition. Planets that are low mass\nand/or close to the star have atmospheres that deplete in impacts, while high\nmass and/or distant planets grow secondary atmospheres. Dividing these outcomes\nis an fv=1 impact shoreline analogous to Zahnle & Catling's cosmic shoreline.\nThe impact shoreline's location depends on assumed impacting planetesimal\nproperties, so conclusions for the atmospheric evolution of a planet like Earth\nwith f_v~1 are only as strong as those assumptions. Application to the\nexoplanet population shows the gap in the planet radius distribution at\n~1.5R_earth is coincident with the impact shoreline, which has a similar\ndependence on orbital period and stellar mass to the observed gap. Given\nsufficient bombardment, planets below the gap would be expected to lose their\natmospheres, while those above could have atmospheres enhanced in volatiles.\nThe level of atmosphere alteration depends on the total bombardment a planet\nexperiences, and so on the system's (usually unknown) other planets and\nplanetesimals, though massive distant planets would have low accretion\nefficiency. Habitable zone planets around lower luminosity stars are more\nsusceptible to atmosphere stripping, disfavouring M stars as hosts of\nlife-bearing planets if Earth-like bombardment is conducive to the development\nof life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Unlike the breaking of\nother symmetries, such as spatial translation in a crystal or spin rotation in\na magnet, time translation symmetry breaking (TTSB) has been tantalisingly\nelusive. We review this history up to recent developments which have shown that\ndiscrete TTSB does takes place in periodically driven (Floquet) systems in the\npresence of many-body localization. Such Floquet time-crystals represent a new\nparadigm in quantum statistical mechanics --- that of an intrinsically\nout-of-equilibrium many-body phase of matter.\n  We include a compendium of necessary background, before specializing to a\ndetailed discussion of the nature, and diagnostics, of TTSB. We formalize the\nnotion of a time-crystal as a stable, macroscopic, conservative clock ---\nexplaining both the need for a many-body system in the infinite volume limit,\nand for a lack of net energy absorption or dissipation.\n  We also cover a range of related phenomena, including various types of\nlong-lived prethermal time-crystals, and expose the roles played by symmetries\n-- exact and (emergent) approximate -- and their breaking. We clarify the\ndistinctions between many-body time-crystals and other ostensibly similar\nphenomena dating as far back as the works of Faraday and Mathieu. En route, we\nencounter Wilczek's suggestion that macroscopic systems should exhibit TTSB in\ntheir ground states, together with a theorem ruling this out. We also analyze\npioneering recent experiments detecting signatures of time crystallinity in a\nvariety of different platforms, and provide a detailed theoretical explanation\nof the physics in each case. In all existing experiments, the system does not\nrealize a `true' time-crystal phase, and we identify necessary ingredients for\nimprovements in future experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 18:05:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-28"}

The classic challenges in the information acquisition\nproblem are the dependence of a planning algorithm on known models and the\ndifficulty of computing information-theoretic cost functions over arbitrary\ndistributions. In contrast, the proposed framework of reinforcement learning\ndoes not require any knowledge on models and alleviates the problems during an\nextended training stage. It results in policies that are efficient to execute\nonline and applicable for real-time control of robotic systems.

The two defining aspects of these methods are that the\ndesign is parameterized by a high-level geometric description and that features\nare mapped onto a fixed grid for analysis. The main motivation for using these\nmethods is to gain better control over the geometry to, for example, facilitate\nimposing direct constraints on geometric features, whilst avoiding issues with\nre-meshing. The review starts by providing some key definitions and then\nexamines the ingredients that these methods use to map geometric features onto\na fixed-grid. One of these ingredients corresponds to the mechanism for mapping\nthe geometry of a single feature onto a fixed analysis grid, from which an\nersatz material or an immersed boundary approach is used for the analysis. For\nthe former case, which we refer to as the pseudo-density approach, a test\nproblem is formulated to investigate aspects of the material interpolation,\nboundary smoothing and numerical integration.

These\noperations use sparse matrix compression as an effective means to avoid storing\nzeros and performing unnecessary computation on zero elements. However,\ncompression techniques like Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) that are widely used\ntoday introduce significant instruction overhead and expensive pointer-chasing\noperations to discover the positions of the non-zero elements. In this paper,\nwe identify the discovery of the positions (i.e., indexing) of non-zero\nelements as a key bottleneck in sparse matrix-based workloads, which greatly\nreduces the benefits of compression. We propose SMASH, a hardware-software\ncooperative mechanism that enables highly-efficient indexing and storage of\nsparse matrices. The key idea of SMASH is to explicitly enable the hardware to\nrecognize and exploit sparsity in data. To this end, we devise a novel software\nencoding based on a hierarchy of bitmaps. This encoding can be used to\nefficiently compress any sparse matrix, regardless of the extent and structure\nof sparsity. At the same time, the bitmap encoding can be directly interpreted\nby the hardware. We design a lightweight hardware unit, the Bitmap Management\nUnit (BMU), that buffers and scans the bitmap hierarchy to perform\nhighly-efficient indexing of sparse matrices. SMASH exposes an expressive and\nrich ISA to communicate with the BMU, which enables its use in accelerating any\nsparse matrix computation. We demonstrate the benefits of SMASH on four use\ncases that include sparse matrix kernels and graph analytics applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 19:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}

Most existing defenses consider additive threat models in which sample\nperturbations have bounded L_p norms.

An\nexample of an attack method based on a non-additive threat model is the\nWasserstein adversarial attack proposed by Wong et al.

A 3D imaging system, using fringe-encoded stereo imaging, is\nextended to capture spatially-varying gloss, utilizing specular reflectance\npolarization. The gloss is measured by sampling the specular reflection around\nBrewster's angle, where these reflections are effectively polarized, and can be\nseparated from the unpolarized, diffuse reflectance. Off-center gloss\nmeasurements are calibrated relative to the center measurement. Off-specular\ngloss measurements, following from local variation of the surface normal, are\nmasked based on the height map and corrected. Shadowed regions, caused by the\n3D relief, are treated similarly. The area of a single capture is approximately\n180x90mm at a resolution of 25x25micron. Aligned color, height, and gloss tiles\nare stitched together, registering overlapping color areas. These maps are\ninputs for a 3D printer.

One of\nthe key challenges for automated reasoning based on natural-language texts is\nthe need to extract meaning (semantics) from texts. Natural language\nunderstanding (NLU) systems describe the conversion from a set of natural\nlanguage utterances to terms in a particular logic. Tools for the\nco-development of grammar and target logic are currently largely missing.\n  We will describe the Grammatical Logical Framework (GLF), a combination of\ntwo existing frameworks, in which large parts of a symbolic, rule-based NLU\nsystem can be developed and implemented: the Grammatical Framework (GF) and\nMMT. GF is a tool for syntactic analysis, generation, and translation with\ncomplex natural language grammars and MMT can be used to specify logical\nsystems and to represent knowledge in them. Combining these tools is possible,\nbecause they are based on compatible logical frameworks: Martin-L\\\"of type\ntheory and LF. The flexibility of logical frameworks is needed, as NLU research\nhas not settled on a particular target logic for meaning representation.\nInstead, new logics are developed all the time to handle various language\nphenomena.

A\nGaussian MRF is an acyclic graph representing a multivariate Gaussian\ndistribution, where nodes are random variables and edges represent the\nconditional dependence between the connected nodes. Since it is possible to\nlearn the edge structure of Gaussian MRFs directly from data, Gaussian MRFs\nprovide an excellent way to understand complex data by revealing the dependence\nstructure among many inputs features, such as genes, sensors, users, documents,\netc. In learning the graphical structure of Gaussian MRFs, it is desired to\ndiscover the actual edges of the underlying but unknown probabilistic graphical\nmodel-it becomes more complicated when the number of random variables\n(features) p increases, compared to the number of data points n. In particular,\nwhen p >> n, it is statistically unavoidable for any estimation procedure to\ninclude false edges. Therefore, there have been many trials to reduce the false\ndetection of edges, in particular, using different types of regularization on\nthe learning parameters.

While the discrete analog of this online learning task has been studied\nextensively, previous work in the continuous setting has neither established\nthe minimax rate nor algorithmically achieved it. In this paper, we show that $\nT $-round switching-constrained OCO with fewer than $ K $ switches has a\nminimax regret of $ \\Theta(\\frac{T}{\\sqrt{K}}) $. In particular, it is at least\n$ \\frac{T}{\\sqrt{2K}} $ for one dimension and at least $ \\frac{T}{\\sqrt{K}} $\nfor higher dimensions. The lower bound in higher dimensions is attained by an\northogonal subspace argument. In one dimension, a novel adversarial strategy\nyields the lower bound of $O(\\frac{T}{\\sqrt{K}})$, but a precise minimax\nanalysis including constants is more involved. To establish the tighter\none-dimensional result, we introduce the \\emph{fugal game} relaxation, whose\nminimax regret lower bounds that of switching-constrained OCO. We show that the\nminimax regret of the fugal game is at least $ \\frac{T}{\\sqrt{2K}} $ and\nthereby establish the optimal minimax lower bound in one dimension.

A cellular automaton is\nasynchronous if at each time-step only one cell is updated. Given\nconfiguration, we say that a cell is unstable if there exists a sequential\nupdating scheme that changes its state. In this context, we define the problem\nAsyncUnstability, which consists in deciding if a cell is unstable or not. In\ngeneral AsyncUnstability is in NP, and we study in which cases we can solve the\nproblem by a more efficient algorithm.\n  We begin showing that AsyncUnstability is in NL for any one-dimensional FCA.\nThen we focus on the family of life-like freezing CA (LFCA), which is a family\nof two-dimensional two-state FCA that generalize the freezing version of the\ngame of life, known as life without death.

For the dilated\nEuclidean distance function we prove the first explicit bounds on the\nstrong-convexity parameter for general treeplexes.

This decomposition mirrors the structure of\nthe counterfactual regret minimization framework, and enables important\ntechniques in practice, such as distributed updates and pruning of cold parts\nof the game tree. Our algorithms provably converge at a rate of $T^{-1}$, which\nis superior to prior counterfactual regret minimization algorithms.

We give an example matrix game where\nCFR+ experimentally converges at a relatively slow rate of $T^{-0.74}$, whereas\nour optimistic methods converge faster than $T^{-1}$.

The topic investigated here is the\nrelationship between star formation rate (SFR) and galaxy radius ($R_{\\rm e}$)\nfor main-sequence star-forming galaxies. The key observational result is that,\nover a wide range of stellar mass and redshift in both CANDELS and SDSS, there\nis little trend between SFR and $R_{\\rm e}$ at fixed stellar mass. The\nKennicutt-Schmidt law, or any similar density-related star formation law, then\nimplies that smaller galaxies must have lower gas fractions than larger\ngalaxies (at fixed $M_{\\ast}$), and this is supported by observations of local\nstar-forming galaxies. We investigate the implication by adopting the\nequilibrium \"bathtub\" model: the ISM gas mass is assumed to be constant over\ntime and the net star formation rate is the difference between the accretion\nrate of gas onto the galaxy from the halo and the outflow rate due to winds. To\nmatch the observed null correlation between SFR and radius, the bathtub model\nrequires that smaller galaxies at fixed mass have weaker galactic winds. Our\nhypothesis is that galaxies are a 2-dimensional family whose properties are set\nmainly by halo mass and concentration.

The proposed DLMD technique uses\nboth the byte and ASM files for feature engineering, thus classifying malware\nfamilies. First, features are extracted from byte files using two different\nDeep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

The idea is to\nconstruct a hybrid feature space by combining the different feature spaces to\novercome the shortcoming of particular feature space and thus, reduce the\nchances of missing a malware. Finally, the hybrid feature space is used to\ntrain a Multilayer Perceptron, which classifies all nine different malware\nfamilies.

This paper investigates the prerequisites of satellite data\nassimilation into a detailed snowpack model. An ensemble version of\nMeteo-France operational snowpack forecasting system (named S2M) was built for\nthis study. This operational system runs on topographic classes instead of grid\npoints, so-called semi-distributed approach. Each class corresponds to one of\nthe 23 mountain massifs of the French Alps (about 1000km^{2} each), an\naltitudinal range (by step of 300m) and aspect (by step of 45{\\deg}). We assess\nthe feasability of satellite data assimilation in such a semi-distributed\ngeometry. Ensemble simulations are compared with satellite observations from\nMODIS and Sentinel-2, and with in-situ reflectance observations. The study\nfocuses on the 2013-2014 and 2016-2017 winters in the Grandes-Rousses massif.\nSubstantial Pearson R^{2} correlations (0.75-0.90) of MODIS observations with\nsimulations are found over the domain. This suggests that assimilating it could\nhave an impact on the spatialized snowpack forecasting system. However,\nobservations contain significant biases (0.1-0.2 in reflectance) which prevent\ntheir direct assimilation. MODIS spectral band ratios seem to be much less\nbiased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 08:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}

By contrast, dramatic performance degradation is observed\nwhen new tasks are added to an existing neural network model. This phenomenon,\ntermed as \\emph{Catastrophic Forgetting}, is one of the major roadblocks that\nprevent deep neural networks from achieving human-level artificial\nintelligence. Several research efforts, e.g. \\emph{Lifelong} or\n\\emph{Continual} learning algorithms, have been proposed to tackle this\nproblem. However, they either suffer from an accumulating drop in performance\nas the task sequence grows longer, or require to store an excessive amount of\nmodel parameters for historical memory, or cannot obtain competitive\nperformance on the new tasks. In this paper, we focus on the incremental\nmulti-task image classification scenario. Inspired by the learning process of\nhuman students, where they usually decompose complex tasks into easier goals,\nwe propose an adversarial feature alignment method to avoid catastrophic\nforgetting. In our design, both the low-level visual features and high-level\nsemantic features serve as soft targets and guide the training process in\nmultiple stages, which provide sufficient supervised information of the old\ntasks and help to reduce forgetting. Due to the knowledge distillation and\nregularization phenomenons, the proposed method gains even better performance\nthan finetuning on the new tasks, which makes it stand out from other methods.\nExtensive experiments in several typical lifelong learning scenarios\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both\naccuracies on new tasks and performance preservation on old tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 09:23:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}

Unlike traditional\nco-training methods that require provided multi-view features and model\nre-training, we propose a novel co-training method, namely multi-label\nco-regularization, for semi-supervised facial AU recognition. Two deep neural\nnetworks are utilized to generate multi-view features for both labeled and\nunlabeled face images, and a multi-view loss is designed to enforce the two\nfeature generators to get conditional independent representations. In order to\nconstrain the prediction consistency of the two views, we further propose a\nmulti-label co-regularization loss by minimizing the distance of the predicted\nAU probability distributions of two views.

The crucial ingredient is to find suitable seed solutions to generate\nnew exact ones for DHOST theories.

Then, taking into account the\nstability of each degeneracy classes of quadratic DHOST theories under a\ngeneral disformal mapping, we consider two kinds of known black hole solutions\nas seed configurations: the Schwarzschild stealth solution and the non-stealth\nReissner-Nordstrom like solution. Restricting our considerations to invertible\ndisformal transformations, we show that building new hairy black hole solutions\nfrom the stealth solution associated to a constant kinetic term is also quite\nconstrained.

For such vectors we present here a\nclass of graphical models, which we call torus graphs, based on the full\nexponential family with pairwise interactions. The topological distinction\nbetween a torus and Euclidean space has several important consequences.\n  Our development was motivated by the problem of identifying phase coupling\namong oscillatory signals recorded from multiple electrodes in the brain:\noscillatory phases across electrodes might tend to advance or recede together,\nindicating coordination across brain areas.

We use a method based on\nHelmholtz's consonance approach to quantify the consonances and dissonances\nbetween each of the pairs of notes in a given temperament.

The latter type of sounds is more realistic in\nthe sense that they reflect non-linearities implied by real-world instruments.\nWhen these consonances/dissonances are estimated along several octaves,\nrespective syntonets can be obtained, in which nodes and weighted edge\nrepresent notes, and consonance/dissonance, respectively.

There has thus been a demand of compression\ntechniques for neural networks. Several proposal in this direction have been\nmade, which famously include hashing-based methods and pruning-based ones.\nHowever, the evaluation of the efficacy of these techniques has so far been\nheterogeneous, with no clear evidence in favor of any of them over the others.\nThe goal of this work is to address this latter issue by providing a\ncomparative study. While most previous studies test the capability of a\ntechnique in reducing the number of parameters of state-of-the-art networks ,\nwe follow [CWT + 15] in evaluating their performance on basic ar-chitectures on\nthe MNIST dataset and variants of it, which allows for a clearer analysis of\nsome aspects of their behavior.

Rather\nsurprisingly, our experiments show that (iterative) pruning-based methods are\nsubstantially better than the HashedNet architecture, whose compression doesn't\nappear advantageous to a carefully chosen convolutional network. We also show\nthat, when the compression level is high, the famous OBD pruning heuristics\ndeteriorates to the point of being less efficient than simple magnitude-based\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 14:08:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}

PDS 70 is a young (5.4 Myr), nearby (~113 pc) star hosting a known\ntransition disk with a large gap. Recent observations with SPHERE and NACO in\nthe near-infrared (NIR) allowed us to detect a planetary mass companion,\nPDS70b, within the disk cavity. Moreover, observations in H_alpha with MagAO\nand MUSE revealed emission associated to PDS70b and to another new companion\ncandidate, PDS70c, at a larger separation from the star. Aims. Our aim is to\nconfirm the discovery of the second planet PDS70c using SPHERE at VLT, to\nfurther characterize its physical properties, and search for additional point\nsources in this young planetary system. Methods. We re-analyzed archival SPHERE\nNIR observations and obtained new data in Y, J, H and K spectral bands for a\ntotal of four different epochs. The data were reduced using the data reduction\nand handling pipeline and the SPHERE data center. We then applied custom\nroutines (e.g. ANDROMEDA and PACO) to subtract the starlight. Results. We\nre-detect both PDS 70 b and c and confirm that PDS70c is gravitationally bound\nto the star. We estimate this second planet to be less massive than 5 M Jup and\nwith a T_eff around 900 K. Also, it has a low gravity with log g between 3.0\nand 3.5 dex. In addition, a third object has been identified at short\nseparation (~0.12\") from the star and gravitationally bound to the star. Its\nspectrum is however very blue, so that we are probably seeing stellar light\nreflected by dust and our analysis seems to demonstrate that it is a feature of\nthe inner disk. We, however, cannot completely exclude the possibility that it\nis a planetary mass object enshrouded by a dust envelope. In this latter case,\nits mass should be of the order of few tens of M_Earth.

We identify here the mechanisms behind this effect. We\nconsider emitters near a waveguide, either centered on the median plane of the\nwaveguide, or displaced from such plane. We show that, independently of the\ndisplacement, the directionality is mostly due to a mirror symmetry breaking\ncaused by the axial character of the angular momentum of the emitted light. The\nsign of the angular momentum along an axis transverse to the waveguide\ndetermines the preferential coupling direction. The degree of directionality\ngrows exponentially as the magnitude of such transverse angular momentum\nincreases linearly. We trace this exponential dependence back to a property of\nthe evanescent angular spectrum of the emissions. A binary and less pronounced\ndirectional coupling effect due to the chiral character of the handedness of\nthe emission is possible when the displacement of the emitter breaks another of\nthe mirror symmetries of the waveguide. We find a selection rule that allows or\nprevents the coupling of centered electric(magnetic) multipolar emissions onto\nthe waveguide modes. We also show that the selection of a different angular\nmomentum axis made in some experiments causes significant differences in the\nway in which directionality depends on angular momentum. We then use these\ndifferences to propose an experiment featuring a transverse magnetic bias that\nallows to aggregate the directional emissions from quantum dots on top of\nwaveguides.

Our aim is to determine the distance of the UV outflow components from\nthe central source, their abundances and total column density, and the\nmechanism responsible for their observed absorption variability.\n  Methods. We studied the UV spectra acquired during the campaign as well as\nfrom three previous epochs (2002-2010). Our main analysis tools are ionic\ncolumn-density extraction techniques and photoionization models (both\nequilibrium and time-dependent models) based on the code Cloudy.\n  Results. For component 1 (at -600 km/s) our findings include the following:\nmetallicity that is roughly twice solar; a simple model based on a fixed total\ncolumn-density absorber, reacting to changes in ionizing illumination that\nmatches the different ionic column densities derived from four spectroscopic\nepochs spanning 13 years; and a distance of R=6+2.5-1.5 pc from the central\nsource. Component 2 (at -1430 km/s) has shallow troughs and is at a much larger\nR. For component 3 (at -1880 km/s) our findings include: a similar metallicity\nto component 1; a photoionization-based model can explain the major features of\nits complicated absorption trough variability and an upper limit of 60 or 150\npc on R.

Aside from the physical limits imposed by\nread noise and photon shot noise, these cameras are typically handheld, have\nsmall apertures and sensors, use mass-produced analog electronics that cannot\neasily be cooled, and are commonly used to photograph subjects that move, like\nchildren and pets. In this paper we describe a system for capturing clean,\nsharp, colorful photographs in light as low as 0.3~lux, where human vision\nbecomes monochromatic and indistinct. To permit handheld photography without\nflash illumination, we capture, align, and combine multiple frames. Our system\nemploys \"motion metering\", which uses an estimate of motion magnitudes (whether\ndue to handshake or moving objects) to identify the number of frames and the\nper-frame exposure times that together minimize both noise and motion blur in a\ncaptured burst. We combine these frames using robust alignment and merging\ntechniques that are specialized for high-noise imagery. To ensure accurate\ncolors in such low light, we employ a learning-based auto white balancing\nalgorithm. To prevent the photographs from looking like they were shot in\ndaylight, we use tone mapping techniques inspired by illusionistic painting:\nincreasing contrast, crushing shadows to black, and surrounding the scene with\ndarkness. All of these processes are performed using the limited computational\nresources of a mobile device. Our system can be used by novice photographers to\nproduce shareable pictures in a few seconds based on a single shutter press,\neven in environments so dim that humans cannot see clearly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 00:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-28"}

Failure to cooperate in the\nprovision or preservation of these goods is fundamental to sustainability\nchallenges, ranging from local fisheries to global climate change. In the real\nworld, such cooperative dilemmas occur in multiple interactions with complex\nstrategic interests and frequently without full information. We argue that\nvoluntary cooperation enabled across multiple coalitions (akin to\npolycentricity) not only facilitates greater generation of non-excludable\npublic goods, but may also allow evolution toward a more cooperative, stable,\nand inclusive approach to governance. Contrary to any previous study, we show\nthat these merits of multi-coalition governance are far more general than the\nsingular examples occurring in the literature, and are robust under diverse\nconditions of excludability, congestability of the non-excludable public good,\nand arbitrary shapes of the return-to-contribution function. We first confirm\nthe intuition that a single coalition without enforcement and with players\npursuing their self-interest without knowledge of returns to contribution is\nprone to cooperative failure. Next, we demonstrate that the same pessimistic\nmodel but with a multi-coalition structure of governance experiences relatively\nhigher cooperation by enabling recognition of marginal gains of cooperation in\nthe game at stake. In the absence of enforcement, public-goods regimes that\nevolve through a proliferation of voluntary cooperative forums can maintain and\nincrease cooperation more successfully than singular, inclusive regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 02:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-28"}

Unfortunately, the solution of the gauge constraint\nis not unique, thus the redundant gauge degree of freedom, called Gribov\ncopies, remains unfixed. One of the traditional methods to partially resolve\nthe Gribov problem is to restrict the space of gauge orbits inside the bounded\nregion known as the Gribov region. The meaning of partially resolve is that\nthis procedure can solve only the positivity's problem of the Faddeev-Popov\noperator but the Gribov copies are still there. However, on the bright side,\nthe restriction to the Gribov region leads to the modification of the gluon\npropagator. Additionally, the new form of the gluon propagator yields the\nviolation of the reflection positivity which is considered as the important\naxiom of the Euclidean quantum field theory. This shows that the gluon field in\nthe Gribov region is an unphysical particle or technically confined. In this\nreview article, we will start by discussing the traditional Faddeev-Popov\nmethod and its consequence on the proof of the unitarity of the perturbative\nYang-Mills theory.

Instead of learning a large collection of\nskills individually, can we instead enable a robot to propose and practice its\nown behaviors automatically, learning about the affordances and behaviors that\nit can perform in its environment, such that it can then repurpose this\nknowledge once a new task is commanded by the user? In this paper, we study\nthis question in the context of self-supervised goal-conditioned reinforcement\nlearning. A central challenge in this learning regime is the problem of goal\nsetting: in order to practice useful skills, the robot must be able to\nautonomously set goals that are feasible but diverse. When the robot's\nenvironment and available objects vary, as they do in most open-world settings,\nthe robot must propose to itself only those goals that it can accomplish in its\npresent setting with the objects that are at hand. Previous work only studies\nself-supervised goal-conditioned RL in a single-environment setting, where goal\nproposals come from the robot's past experience or a generative model are\nsufficient. In more diverse settings, this frequently leads to impossible goals\nand, as we show experimentally, prevents effective learning. We propose a\nconditional goal-setting model that aims to propose goals that are feasible\nfrom the robot's current state. We demonstrate that this enables\nself-supervised goal-conditioned off-policy learning with raw image\nobservations in the real world, enabling a robot to manipulate a variety of\nobjects and generalize to new objects that were not seen during training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 18:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-28"}

Key to ZSL is to transfer knowledge from the seen to the\nunseen classes via auxiliary semantic prototypes (e.g., word or attribute\nvectors). However, the popularly learned projection functions in previous works\ncannot generalize well due to non-visual components included in semantic\nprototypes. Besides, the incompleteness of provided prototypes and captured\nimages has less been considered by the state-of-the-art approaches in ZSL. In\nthis paper, we propose a hierarchical prototype learning formulation to provide\na systematical solution (named HPL) for zero-shot recognition. Specifically,\nHPL is able to obtain discriminability on both seen and unseen class domains by\nlearning visual prototypes respectively under the transductive setting. To\nnarrow the gap of two domains, we further learn the interpretable\nsuper-prototypes in both visual and semantic spaces.

Here, we report the observation of a weak-to-strong\nmeasurement transition in a single trapped $40Ca^+$ ion system. The transition\nis realized by tuning the interaction strength between the ion's internal\nelectronic state and its vibrational motion, which play the roles of the\nmeasured system and the measuring pointer, respectively.

Quantitatively, the\nweak-to-strong measurement transition is characterized by a universal\ntransition factor $e^{-\\Gamma^2}$, where $\\Gamma$ is a dimensionless parameter\nrelated to the system-apparatus coupling.

This work proposes using deep reinforcement (RL)\nlearning as a framework to model the complex interactions and cooperation with\nnearby, decision-making agents, such as pedestrians and other robots. Existing\nRL-based works assume homogeneity of agent properties, use specific motion\nmodels over short timescales, or lack a principled method to handle a large,\npossibly varying number of agents. Therefore, this work develops an algorithm\nthat learns collision avoidance among a variety of heterogeneous,\nnon-communicating, dynamic agents without assuming they follow any particular\nbehavior rules. It extends our previous work by introducing a strategy using\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) that enables the algorithm to use observations of\nan arbitrary number of other agents, instead of a small, fixed number of\nneighbors. The proposed algorithm is shown to outperform a classical collision\navoidance algorithm, another deep RL-based algorithm, and scales with the\nnumber of agents better (fewer collisions, shorter time to goal) than our\npreviously published learning-based approach. Analysis of the LSTM provides\ninsights into how observations of nearby agents affect the hidden state and\nquantifies the performance impact of various agent ordering heuristics. The\nlearned policy generalizes to several applications beyond the training\nscenarios: formation control (arrangement into letters), demonstrations on a\nfleet of four multirotors and on a fully autonomous robotic vehicle capable of\ntraveling at human walking speed among pedestrians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 04:26:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2020 19:07:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 20:47:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 16:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

Three stage\nsleep classification was achieved using a Random Forest (RF) classifier and\nfeatures derived from a combination of cost-effective and easy to use sensors,\nnamely electrocardiogram (ECG), electrooculogram (EOG), and electromyogram\n(EMG) channels. Subsequently, RBD detection was achieved using established and\nnew metrics derived from ECG and EMG metrics. The EOG and EMG combination\nprovided the best minimalist fully automated performance, achieving\n$0.57\\pm0.19$ kappa (3 stage) for sleep staging and an RBD detection accuracy\nof $0.90\\pm0.11$, (sensitivity, and specificity $0.88\\pm0.13$, and\n$0.92\\pm0.098$). A single ECG sensor allowed three state sleep staging with\n$0.28\\pm0.06$ kappa and RBD detection accuracy of $0.62\\pm0.10$. This study\ndemonstrated the feasibility of using signals from a single EOG and EMG sensor\nto detect RBD using fully-automated techniques. This study proposes a\ncost-effective, practical, and simple RBD identification support tool using\nonly two sensors (EMG and EOG), ideal for screening purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 11:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-28"}

First, to identify distinct\ncommenting patterns, we use deep embedded clustering to estimate framing\ninformation (essential extrinsic features) that clusters users into distinct\ngroups.Second, we present an inverse reinforcement learning algorithm that uses\nBayesian revealed preferences to test for rationality: does there exist a\nutility function that rationalizes the given data, and if yes, can it be used\nto predict commenting behavior? Finally, we impose behavioral economics\nconstraints stemming from rational inattention to characterize the attention\nspan of groups of users.

Here we\npropose a novel design, featuring a dual functionality on-chip: boosted\noptically-driven particle diffusion and nanoparticle sorting. Our methodology\nis based on a specially designed high-index dielectric nanoantenna, which\nstrongly enhances spin-orbit angular momentum transfer from an incident laser\nbeam to the scattered field. As a result, exceptionally compact, subwavelength\noptical nanovortices are formed and drive spiral motion of peculiar plasmonic\nnanoparticles via the efficient interplay between curled spin optical forces\nand radiation pressure. The nanovortex size is an order of magnitude smaller\nthan that provided by conventional beam-based approaches. The nanoparticles\nmediate nano-confined fluid motion enabling nanomixing without a need of moving\nbulk elements inside a microchamber. Moreover, precise sorting of gold\nnanoparticles, demanded for on-chip separation and filtering, can be achieved\nby exploiting the non-trivial dependence of the curled optical forces on the\nnanoobject size.

Within\nthis framework, we aim at improving the freshness of updates at decision epochs\nby scheduling the update arrival process and the decision making process.\nTheoretical results show that 1) when the decisions are made according to a\nPoisson process, the average AuD is independent of decision rate and would be\nminimized if the arrival process is periodic (i.e., deterministic); 2) when\nboth the decision process and the arrive process are periodic, the average AuD\nis larger than, but decreases with decision rate to, the average AuD of the\ncorresponding system with Poisson decisions (i.e., random); 3) when both the\ndecision process and the arrive process are periodic, the average AuD can be\nfurther decreased by optimally controlling the offset between the two\nprocesses.

A possible application is in Positron Emission\nTomography, where annihilation quanta with orthogonal polarizations are\nemitted. Since polarization can be measured via Compton scattering, the initial\northogonality of polarizations can be translated to correlation of azimuthal\nscattering angles, and this correlation may be exploited as an additional\nhandle to identify the true coincidence events. To examine the concept of using\nthe polarization correlations in PET, we have used a system of two compact,\nposition and energy-sensitive Compton detectors in coincidence mode. Each\nconsists of a single matrix of scintillation pixels, read-out by an array of\nSilicon photomultipliers. The Compton events in each module are clearly\nidentified and the scattering angles are reconstructed from the energy\ndeposition and event topology. We have extracted the polarimetric modulation\nfactors from the distributions of the difference of the azimuthal angles of the\ntwo Compton-scattered gammas and studied their dependence on Compton scattering\nangles $\\theta$ and on azimuthal resolution $\\Delta\\phi$. For scattering angles\naround $\\theta_{1,2}=82^\\circ$, where the maximum modulation is expected, the\nmodulation factors from $\\mu=0.15\\pm 0.01$ to $\\mu=0.27\\pm 0.02$ have been\nmeasured, depending on the azimuthal resolution, which is governed by event\ntopology in the detectors.

We design the lattices to extremize effective properties. As\ncustomary in topology optimization, we design a periodic unit cell of the\nlattice and obtain the effective properties via numerical homogenization. Each\nbar is represented as a cylindrical offset surface of a medial axis\nparameterized by the positions of the endpoints of the medial axis. These\nparameters are smoothly mapped onto a continuous density field for the primal\nand sensitivity analysis via the geometry projection method. A size variable\nper material is ascribed to each bar and penalized as in density-based topology\noptimization to facilitate the entire removal of bars from the design. During\nthe optimization, we allow bars to be made of a mixture of the available\nmaterials. However, to ensure each bar is either exclusively made of one\nmaterial or removed altogether from the optimal design, we impose optimization\nconstraints that ensure each size variable is 0 or 1, and that at most one\nmaterial size variable is 1. The proposed material interpolation scheme readily\naccommodates any number of materials. To obtain lattices with desired material\nsymmetries, we design only a reference region of the unit cell and reflect its\ngeometry projection with respect to the appropriate planes of symmetry. Also,\nto ensure bars remain whole upon reflection inside the unit cell or with\nrespect to the periodic boundaries, we impose a no-cut constraint on the bars.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of our method via numerical examples of bulk and\nshear moduli maximization and Poisson's ratio minimization for two- and\nthree-material lattices with cubic symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 20:40:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

In this work, we present fully kinetic\nParticle-In-Cell simulations of different boundary layers characterized by the\nfollowing main ingredients: a velocity shear, a density gradient and a magnetic\ngradient localized at the same position. In particular, the presence of a\ndensity gradient drives the development of the lower hybrid drift instability\n(LHDI), which competes with the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) in the\ndevelopment of the boundary layer. Depending on the density gradient, the LHDI\ncan even dominate the dynamics of the layer. Because these two instabilities\ngrow on different spatial and temporal scales, when the LHDI develops faster\nthan the KHI an inverse cascade is generated, at least in 2D. This inverse\ncascade, starting at the LHDI kinetic scales, generates structures at scale\nlengths at which the KHI would typically develop. When that is the case, those\nstructures can suppress the KHI itself because they significantly affect the\nunderlying velocity shear gradient. We conclude that depending on the density\ngradient, the velocity jump and the width of the boundary layer, the LHDI in\nits nonlinear phase can become the primary instability for plasma mixing.

This problem can be converted into the\ncontribution of different face areas to different emotions.

To obtain more\nconvincing results, our experiments are conducted on three different databases:\nfacial expression recognition + ( FER+), real-world affective faces database\n(RAF-DB) and expression in-the-wild (ExpW) dataset. Through analysis of the\nclassification accuracy, the confusion matrix and the class activation map\n(CAM), we can establish convincing results. To sum up, the contributions of\nthis paper lie in two areas: 1) We visualize concerned areas of human faces in\nemotion recognition; 2) We analyze the contribution of different face areas to\ndifferent emotions in real-world conditions through experimental analysis. Our\nfindings can be combined with findings in psychology to promote the\nunderstanding of emotional expressions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 16:04:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-14"}

Therefore,\nextrapolation is required to estimate long-term treatment effect. Registry data\ncan provide evidence to support extrapolation of treatment effects from RCTs,\nwhich are considered the main sources of evidence of effect for new drug\napplications. A number of methods are available to extrapolate survival data,\nsuch as Exponential, Weibull, Gompertz, log-logistic or log-normal parametric\nmodels. The different methods have varying functional forms and can result in\ndifferent survival estimates.\n  Methods: The aim of this paper was to use registry data to supplement the\nrelatively short term RCT data to obtain long term estimates of effect. No\nformal hypotheses were tested. We explore the above parametric regression\nmodels as well as a nonparametric regression model based on local linear\n(parametric) regression. We also explore a Bayesian model constrained to the\nlong term estimate of survival reported in literature, a Bayesian power prior\napproach on the variability observed from published literature, and a Bayesian\nModel Averaging (BMA) approach. The methods were applied to extrapolate overall\nsurvival of a RCT in metastatic melanoma.\n  Results: The results showed that the BMA approach was able to fit the RCT\ndata well, with the lowest variability of the area under the curve up to 72\nmonths with or without the SEER Medicare registry.\n  Conclusion: the BMA approach is a viable approach to extrapolate overall\nsurvival in the absence of long term data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 11:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-14"}

PharML.Bind\nis a machine learning toolkit which is able to accomplish this feat. Utilizing\ndeep neural networks and big data, PharML.Bind correlates\nexperimentally-derived drug affinities and protein-ligand X-ray structures to\ncreate novel predictions. The utility of PharML.Bind is in its application as a\nrapid, accurate, and robust prediction platform for discovery and personalized\nmedicine. This paper demonstrates that graph neural networks (GNNs) can be\ntrained to screen hundreds of thousands of compounds against thousands of\ntargets in minutes, a vastly shorter time than previous approaches. This\nmanuscript presents results from training and testing using the entirety of\nBindingDB after cleaning; this includes a test set with 19,708 X-ray structures\nand 247,633 drugs, leading to 2,708,151 unique protein-ligand pairings.\nPharML.Bind achieves a prodigious 98.3% accuracy on this test set in under 25\nminutes. PharML.Bind is premised on the following key principles: 1) speed and\na high enrichment factor per unit compute time, provided by high-quality\ntraining data combined with a novel GNN architecture and use of\nhigh-performance computing resources, 2) the ability to generalize to proteins\nand drugs outside of the training set, including those with unknown active\nsites, through the use of an active-site-agnostic GNN mapping, and 3) the\nability to be easily integrated as a component of increasingly-complex\nprediction and analysis pipelines. PharML.Bind represents a timely and\npractical approach to leverage the power of machine learning to efficiently\nanalyze and predict drug action on any practical scale and will provide utility\nin a variety of discovery and medical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 23:32:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}

Since ancient times science and philosophy evolved in parallel, thus\nrenewing from time to time the epochal paradigms of human thought. We could not\nunderstand how the scientists of the past could have achieved so many goals, if\nwe neglect the philosophical ideas that inspired their minds. Today, despite\nthe spectacular successes of the Standard Models of Elementary Particles (SMEP)\nand Modern Cosmology (SMMC), theoretical physics seems to be run into a mess of\ncontradictions that preclude the access to higher views. We are still unable to\nexplain why it is so difficult to include gravitation into the SMEP, although\nGeneral Relativity (GR) works so well in the SMMC, why it is so difficult to\nget rid of all the divergences of the SMEP, and \"why there is something rather\nthan nothing\". This paper aims to answer these and other questions by starting\nfrom a novel fundamental principle: the spontaneous breaking of conformal\nsymmetry down to the metric symmetry of GR. This statement is very simple but\nits implementation is a little bit complicated. To facilitate the reading, the\npaper is divided in a main sequence of sections and subsections and a\ncollection of Appendices.
