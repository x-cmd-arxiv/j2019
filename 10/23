At k=1 and k=n-1,\nwe recover results for the classical caracol graph and the Pitman--Stanley\ngraph. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of in-degree gravity diagrams for\nflow polytopes, which are equinumerous with (out-degree) gravity diagrams\nconsidered by Benedetti et al..

Data skew is a ubiquitous\nfeature of these real-world domains. In a retail database, some products are\ntypically much more popular than others. In a text database, word frequencies\nfollow a Zipf distribution with a small number of very common words, and a long\ntail of infrequent words. In a geographic database, some regions have much\nhigher populations (and data measurements) than others. Current systems do not\nmake the most of caches for exploiting skew. In particular, a whole cache line\nmay remain cache resident even though only a small part of the cache line\ncorresponds to a popular data item. In this paper, we propose a novel index\nstructure for repositioning data items to concentrate popular items into the\nsame cache lines. The net result is better spatial locality, and better\nutilization of limited cache resources. We develop a theoretical model for\nanalyzing the cache behavior, and implement database operators that are\nefficient in the presence of skew. Our experiments on real and synthetic data\nshow that exploiting skew can significantly improve in-memory query\nperformance. In some cases, our techniques can speed up queries by over an\norder of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 16:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-03"}

The scales of the models proposed are too large to be\neasily run on mobile devices.

To address the challenge of generating a large number of\nhigh-dimensional item embeddings, we devise a rise-dimensional generation\nstrategy that first generates a low-dimensional item embedding matrix and a\nrise-dimensional matrix, and then multiply them to obtain high-dimensional\nembeddings. We use the generated model to produce private RPs for the given\nuser on her device. MetaMF shows a high capacity even with a small RP model,\nwhich can adapt to the limitations of a mobile environment.

Surprisingly,\nin some tasks such as image deblurring, many of such methods fail to converge\nfaster than the accelerated deterministic gradient methods, even in terms of\nepoch counts. We investigate this phenomenon and propose a theory-inspired\nmechanism for the practitioners to efficiently characterize whether it is\nbeneficial for an inverse problem to be solved by stochastic optimization\ntechniques or not. Using standard tools in numerical linear algebra, we derive\nconditions on the spectral structure of the inverse problem for being a\nsuitable application of stochastic gradient methods. Particularly, we show\nthat, for an imaging inverse problem, if and only if its Hessain matrix has a\nfast-decaying eigenspectrum, then the stochastic gradient methods can be more\nadvantageous than deterministic methods for solving such a problem.

Here, a coupling relation for the\ndiffusion-controlled mixture parameter local enthalpy with local flame geometry\nand structure is derived, characterized by the key parameters $\\kappa$ and ${\\\n|\\nabla c \\ t|/\\ |\\nabla c \\ |_{\\mathrm{lam}}}$. The analysis shows that the\nlarge positive global mean curvature intrinsic to the flame kernel\nconfiguration may detrimentally affect the local mixture state inside the\nreaction zone, particularly during the initial kernel development phase.\nExternal energy supply by spark ignition may effectively bridge over this\ncritical stage, which causes the impact of global mean flame kernel curvature\nto be small under the present conditions compared to the overall effect of\n$\\mathrm{Le}\\neq1$. Once ignition effects have decayed, the mixture state\ninside the reaction zone locally exhibits an identical dependence on $\\ |\\nabla\nc \\ |$ as in a strained laminar flame. This implies that differential diffusion\neffects under engine-typical Karlovitz numbers are not weakened by small-scale\nturbulent mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 17:32:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 13:10:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-08"}

We complete the proposed CC\nextensions by constructing compact tensor representations of coefficients, or\n$T$-amplitudes, using superpositions of tree tensor networks which take into\naccount different possible types of entanglement between excited particles and\nholes.

Phases of matter are classified\nby symmetry breaking, topological phases are characterized by non-local\nsymmetries, and point group symmetries are critical to our understanding of\ncrystalline materials. Symmetries could then be used as a criterion to engineer\nquantum systems with targeted properties. Toward that end, we have developed a\nnovel approach, the symmetric Hamiltonian construction (SHC), that takes as\ninput symmetries, specified by integrals of motion or discrete symmetry\ntransformations, and produces as output all local Hamiltonians consistent with\nthese symmetries (see github.com/ClarkResearchGroup/qosy for our open-source\ncode). This approach builds on the slow operator method [PRE 92, 012128]. We\nuse our new approach to construct new Hamiltonians for topological phases of\nmatter.\n  Topological phases of matter are exotic quantum phases with potential\napplications in quantum computation. In this work, we focus on two types of\ntopological phases of matter: superconductors with Majorana zero modes and\n$Z_2$ quantum spin liquids. In our first application of the SHC approach, we\nanalytically construct a large and highly tunable class of superconducting\nHamiltonians with Majorana zero modes with a given targeted spatial\ndistribution. This result lays the foundation for potential new experimental\nroutes to realizing Majorana fermions. In our second application, we find new\n$Z_2$ spin liquid Hamiltonians on the square and kagome lattices. These new\nHamiltonians are not sums of commuting operators nor frustration-free and, when\nperturbed appropriately (in a way that preserves their $Z_2$ spin liquid\nbehavior), exhibit level-spacing statistics that suggest non-integrability.\nThis result demonstrates how our approach can automatically generate new spin\nliquid Hamiltonians with interesting properties not often seen in solvable\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

We observe the tendency\nfor the angular momentum flux of fast wind streams to be oppositely signed to\nthe slow wind streams, as noted by previous authors. From the average total\nflux, we estimate the global angular momentum loss rate of the Sun to be\n$3.3\\times10^{30}$erg, which lies within the range of various MHD wind models\nin the literature. This angular momentum loss rate is a factor of $\\sim$2\nweaker than required for a Skumanich-like rotation period evolution\n($\\Omega_*\\propto $ stellar age$^{-1/2}$), which should be considered in\nstudies of the rotation period evolution of Sun-like stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 18:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

Intraoperatively, but prior to any osteotomies, two\nconstellations of metallic ball-bearings (BBs) are injected into the wing of a\npatient's ilium and lateral superior pubic ramus.

The relative pose of the fragment is established by estimating the\nmovement of the two BB constellations using a single fluoroscopic view taken\nafter osteotomy and fragment relocation.

This breakthrough result, which\nrepresents a powerful confirmation of Einstein's theory of gravity, or general\nrelativity, was made possible by assembling a global network of radio\ntelescopes operating at millimetre wavelengths that for the first time included\nthe Atacama Large Millimeter/ submillimeter Array (ALMA). The addition of ALMA\nas an anchor station has enabled a giant leap forward by increasing the\nsensitivity limits of the EHT by an order of magnitude, effectively turning it\ninto an imaging array. The published image demonstrates that it is now possible\nto directly study the event horizon shadows of SMBHs via electromagnetic\nradiation, thereby transforming this elusive frontier from a mathematical\nconcept into an astrophysical reality. The expansion of the array over the next\nfew years will include new stations on different continents - and eventually\nsatellites in space. This will provide progressively sharper and\nhigher-fidelity images of SMBH candidates, and potentially even movies of the\nhot plasma orbiting around SMBHs. These improvements will shed light on the\nprocesses of black hole accretion and jet formation on event-horizon scales,\nthereby enabling more precise tests of general relativity in the truly strong\nfield regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 18:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-24"}

Reinforcement learning can address these\nissues by directly mapping the observed states to optimal actions that maximize\nthe cumulative reward. However, the local minima caused by unsuitable rewards\nand the overestimation of the cumulative reward impede the maximization of the\ncumulative reward. To increase the cumulative reward, this paper designs a gait\nreward based on walking principles, which compensates the local minima for\nunnatural motions. Besides, an Adversarial Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic\n(ATD3) policy gradient algorithm with a recurrent neural network (RNN) is\nproposed to further boost the cumulative reward by mitigating the\noverestimation of the cumulative reward. Experimental results in the Roboschool\nWalker2d and Webots Atlas simulators indicate that the test rewards increase by\n23.50% and 9.63% after adding the gait reward. The test rewards further\nincrease by 15.96% and 12.68% after using the ATD3_RNN, and the reason may be\nthat the ATD3_RNN decreases the error of estimating cumulative reward from\n19.86% to 3.35%. Besides, the cosine kinetic similarity between the human and\nthe biped robot trained by the gait reward and ATD3_RNN increases by over\n69.23%. Consequently, the designed gait reward and ATD3_RNN boost the\ncumulative reward and teach biped robots to walk better.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 18:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-24"}

We also\nprovide relevant discussions about selected applications that would greatly\nbenefit from DL at the edge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 21:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-24"}

This assumption restricts the use of those models to the\ncase in which all items have a symmetric behaviour. On the other hand,\nasymmetric models proposed in the literature impose that all the items in a\ntest have an asymmetric behaviour. This assumption is inappropriate for great\npart of the tests which are, in general, composed by both symmetric and\nasymmetric items. Furthermore, a straightforward extension of the existing\nmodels in the literature would require a prior selection of the items'\nsymmetry/asymmetry status. This paper proposes a Bayesian IRT model that\naccounts for symmetric and asymmetric items in a flexible though parsimonious\nway. That is achieved by assigning a finite mixture prior to the skewness\nparameter, with one of the mixture components being a point-mass at zero. This\nallows for analyses under both model selection and model averaging approaches.\nAsymmetric item curves are designed through the centred skew normal\ndistribution, which has a particularly appealing parametrisation in terms of\nparameter interpretation and computational efficiency. An efficient MCMC\nalgorithm is proposed to perform Bayesian inference and its performance is\ninvestigated in some simulated examples. Finally, the proposed methodology is\napplied to a data set from a large scale educational exam in Brazil.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 21:13:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 15:45:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2022 21:38:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 20:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

Moreover, we show that in the viable parameter space the decay of\nsuch \"heavy\" sterile neutrinos in the SN envelope would lead to a very\nenergetic flux of daughter active neutrinos; if not too far below current\nlimits, this would be detectable in large underground neutrino observatories,\nlike Super-Kamiokande, as a (slightly time-delayed) high-energy bump in the\nspectrum of a forthcoming Galactic SN event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 22:05:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 22:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

It may not be feasible to\nconsolidate the data from mobile devices into a cloud service, due to bandwidth\nand data privacy reasons. Training at mobile devices is however fraught with\nchallenges. First mobile devices may join or leave the distributed setting,\neither voluntarily or due to environmental uncertainties, such as lack of\npower. Tolerating uncertainties is critical to the success of distributed\nmobile training. One proactive approach to tolerate computational uncertainty\nis to store data in a coded format and perform training on coded data.

Furthermore, coded computing traditionally\nrelied on a central node to encode and distribute data to all the worker nodes,\nwhich is not practical in a distributed mobile setting.\n  In this paper, we tackle the uncertainty in distributed mobile training using\na bandwidth-efficient encoding strategy.

Most auto insurance BMSs assume that\npolicyholders in the same bonus-malus (BM) level share the same a posteriori\nrisk adjustment. This system reflects the policyholder's claim history in a\nrelatively simple manner. However, the typical system follows a single BM scale\nand is known to suffer from the double-counting problem: policyholders in the\nhigh-risk classes in terms of a priori characteristics are penalized too\nseverely (Taylor, 1997; Pitrebois et al., 2003).

Furthermore,\ncertain caution is needed when studying the interplay between incoherent magnon\nand coherent magnon spin transport in the nonlocal transport configuration,\nsince the change in microwave-induced spin-pumping voltage can overwhelm the\nincoherent magnon transport signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 02:54:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 02:47:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-28"}

We address these\nlimitations through a new approach where the shields are synthesized at runtime\nand do not require global information. There is a shield onboard every agent,\nwhich can only modify the behavior of the corresponding agent. In this\napproach, which is fundamentally decentralized, the shield on every agent has\ntwo components: a pathfinder that corrects the behavior of the agent and an\nordering mechanism that dynamically modifies the priority of the agent.

For pure factor models, if the number of\nfactors is known, we develop adaptive estimation and inference procedures that\nattain the minimax rate. However, when the number of factors is not specified a\npriori, we show that there is a tradeoff between validity and efficiency: any\nconfidence interval that has uniform validity for arbitrary factor strength has\nto be conservative; in particular its width is bounded away from zero even when\nthe factors are strong.

Through analyzing the\nphotospheric magnetic field properties, it is found that the formation of the\npenumbra originated from the newly emerging magnetic bipole that were trapped\nin the photosphere. The change of magnetic fields in penumbra from horizontal\nto vertical can cause the disappearance of penumbra. The transformation of the\nmagnetic field between the umbra and the penumbra is found and the outward moat\nflow around sunspot gradually decreased and vanished during the decay of\nsunspot. In addition, we found that the mean longitudinal magnetic strength in\npenumbra decreased and the mean transverse magnetic strength in penumbra\nincreased with the increasing penumbral area during the formation of sunspots.\nHowever, during the decay of sunspots, the mean longitudinal magnetic strength\nin penumbra increased and the mean transverse magnetic strength in penumbra\ndecreased with the decreasing penumbral area. Comparatively, the dependence of\nthe area and the mean transverse/longitudinal magnetic field strength in umbra\nis not remarkable.

In the domain of learning to rank for IR, current deep learning models\nare trained on objective functions different from the measures they are\nevaluated on. Since most evaluation measures are discrete quantities, they\ncannot be leveraged by directly using gradient descent algorithms without an\napproximation. BanditRank bridges this gap by directly optimizing a\ntask-specific measure, such as mean average precision (MAP), using gradient\ndescent. Specifically, a contextual bandit whose action is to rank input\ndocuments is trained using a policy gradient algorithm to directly maximize the\nreward. The reward can be a single measure, such as MAP, or a combination of\nseveral measures. The notion of ranking is also inherent in BanditRank, similar\nto the current \\textit{listwise} approaches.

Motivated by previous work on dually chordal\ngraphs and graphs of bounded distance VC-dimension we prove several new results\non the complexity of computing the diameter and the radius on Helly graphs and\nrelated graph classes.\n  * First, we present algorithms which given an $n$-vertex $m$-edge Helly graph\n$G$ as input, compute w.h.p. its radius and its diameter in time $\\tilde{\\cal\nO}(m\\sqrt{n})$. Our algorithms are based on the Helly property and on several\nimplications of the unimodality of the eccentricity function in Helly graphs:\nevery vertex of locally minimum eccentricity is a central vertex.\n  * Then, we focus on $C_4$-free Helly graphs, which include, amongst other\nsubclasses, bridged Helly graphs and so, chordal Helly graphs and hereditary\nHelly graphs. For the $C_4$-free Helly graphs, we present linear-time\nalgorithms for computing the eccentricity of all vertices. Doing so, we\ngeneralize previous results on strongly chordal graphs to a much larger\nsubclass.\n  * Finally, we derive from our findings on chordal Helly graphs a more general\none-to-many reduction from diameter computation on chordal graphs to either\ndiameter computation on split graphs or the {\\sc Disjoint Set} problem.\nTherefore, split graphs are in some sense the {\\em only} hard instances for\ndiameter computation on chordal graphs. As a byproduct of our reduction the\neccentricity of all vertices in a chordal graph can be approximated in ${\\cal\nO}(m\\log{n})$ time with an additive one-sided error of at most one, and on any\nsubclass of chordal graphs with constant VC-dimension the diameter can be\ncomputed in truly subquadratic time.\n  These above results are a new step toward better understanding the role of\nabstract geometric properties in the fast computation of metric graph\ninvariants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 08:44:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 13:42:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

We build upon and extend the Bitcoin backbone protocol by defining\nconsistency and scalability. Consistency encompasses the need for atomic\nexecution of cross-shard transactions to preserve safety, whereas scalability\nencapsulates the speedup a sharded system can gain in comparison to a\nnon-sharded system.\n  Using our model, we explore the limitations of sharding. We show that a\nsharded ledger with $n$ participants cannot scale under a fully adaptive\nadversary, but it can scale up to $m$ shards where $n=c'm\\log m$, under an\nepoch-adaptive adversary; the constant $c'$ encompasses the trade-off between\nsecurity and scalability.

Employing higher carrier\nfrequencies introduces new challenges for the propagation channel such as\nhigher path loss and rapid signal degradations. On the other hand, higher\nfrequencies allow deployment of small-sized antenna elements that enable\nbeamforming. To investigate user mobility under these new propagation\nconditions, a proper model is needed that captures spatial and temporal\ncharacteristics of the channel in beamformed networks. Current channel models\nthat have been developed for 5G networks are computationally inefficient and\nlead to infeasible simulation time for most user mobility simulations.

The\nbinary-driven hypernova progenitor is a binary system composed of a\ncarbon-oxygen star and a neutron star (NS) companion. The gravitational\ncollapse leads to a type Ic supernova (SN) explosion and triggers an accretion\nprocess onto the NS. For orbital periods of a few minutes, the NS reaches the\ncritical mass and forms a black hole (BH). Two physical situations produce MeV\n$\\nu$s. First, during the accretion, the NS surface emits $\\nu$-$\\bar{\\nu}$\npairs by thermal production. We calculate the properties and the flavor\nevolution of such a $\\nu$ emission.

Moreover, each worker transmits the quantized\ndifference between its current model and its previously quantized model,\nthereby decreasing the communication payload size. However, due to the lack of\ncentralized entity in decentralized ML, the spatial sparsity and payload\ncompression may incur error propagation, hindering model training convergence.\nTo overcome this, we develop a novel stochastic quantization method to\nadaptively adjust model quantization levels and their probabilities, while\nproving the convergence of Q-GADMM for convex objective functions. Furthermore,\nto demonstrate the feasibility of Q-GADMM for non-convex and stochastic\nproblems, we propose quantized stochastic GADMM (Q-SGADMM) that incorporates\ndeep neural network architectures and stochastic sampling.

In this\npaper, we introduce a consistent physical model that can be applied to mapping\nas well as to localization. It naturally deals with unstructured environments\nand makes use of both out-of-range measurements and information about the ray\npath. The approach can be seen as a generalization of the well-established\nreflection model, but in addition to counting ray reflections and traversals in\na specific map cell, it considers the distances that all rays travel inside\nthis cell.

While an increase in mass loss is\ntheoretically predicted, this has so far not been observationally confirmed.\nHowever, radiation-driven winds of massive stars are known to exhibit clumpy\nstructures triggered by the line-deshadowing instability (LDI). Wind clumping\naffects empirical mass-loss rates inferred from density square-dependent\nspectral diagnostics. If clumping properties differ significantly for O and B\nsupergiants across the bi-stability jump, this may help alleviate discrepancies\nbetween theory and observations. We investigate with analytical and numerical\ntools how the onset of clumpy structures behaves in the winds of O supergiants\n(OSG) and B supergiants (BSG) across the bi-stability jump. We derive a scaling\nrelation for the linear growth rate of the LDI for a single optically thick\nline and apply it in both regimes. We run 1D time-dependent line-driven\ninstability simulations to study the non-linear evolution of the LDI in clumpy\nOSG and BSG winds. Linear perturbation analysis for a single line shows that\nthe LDI linear growth rate scales strongly with stellar effective temperature\nand terminal wind speed. This implies significantly lower growth rates for\n(cooler, slower) BSG winds than for OSG winds. This is confirmed by the\nnon-linear simulations, which show significant differences in OSG and BSG wind\nstructure formation, with the latter characterized by significantly weaker\nclumping factors and lower velocity dispersions. This suggests that lower\ncorrection factors due to clumping should be employed when deriving empirical\nmass-loss rates for BSGs on the cool side of the bi-stability jump. Moreover,\nthe non-linear simulations provide a theoretical background toward explaining\nthe general lack of observed intrinsic X-ray emission in (single) B star winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 11:41:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

These algorithms\ntypically determine the map as the set of reflection probabilities that\nmaximizes the likelihood of the underlying laser data and do not compute the\nfull posterior distribution over all possible maps. Thereby, they discard\ncrucial information about the confidence of the estimate. The approach\npresented in this paper preserves this information by determining the full map\nposterior. In general, this problem is hard because distributions over\nreal-valued quantities can possess infinitely many dimensions. However, for two\nstate-of-the-art beam-based lidar models, our approach yields closed-form map\nposteriors that possess only two parameters per cell. Even better, these\nposteriors come for free, in the sense that they use the same parameters as the\ntraditional approaches, without the need for additional computations. An\nimportant use case for grid maps is robot localization, which we formulate as\nBayesian filtering based on the closed-form map posterior rather than based on\na single map. The resulting measurement likelihoods can also be expressed in\nclosed form. In simulations and extensive real-world experiments, we show that\nleveraging the full map posterior improves the localization accuracy compared\nto approaches that use the most likely map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 11:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-24"}

In this paper, we investigate how the range\nof cooperative interactions within a prey group affects the survival chances of\nthe group while chased by a predator. As observed in nature, the interaction\nrange of preys may vary due to their vision, age, or even physical structure.\nBased on a simple theoretical prey-predator model, here, we show that an\noptimality criterion for the survival can be established on the interaction\nrange of preys. Very short range or long range interactions are shown to be\ninefficient for the escape mechanism. Interestingly, for an intermediate range\nof interaction, survival probability of the prey group is found to be maximum.\nOur analysis also shows that the nature of the escape trajectories strongly\ndepends on the range of interactions between preys and corroborates with the\nnaturally observed escape patterns. Moreover, we find that the optimal survival\nregime depends on the prey group size and also on the predator strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 13:06:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 02:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}

In this paper, we demonstrate that material interfaces with a\ntemperature discontinuity result in numerical unphysical pressure oscillations\nif the species internal energy is nonlinear with respect to temperature. We\ndemonstrate that a temperature discontinuity is the only type of material\ninterface that results in unphysical pressure oscillations for a conservative\ndiscretization of the total energy formulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat unphysical pressure oscillations will be generated at any material\ninterface, including material interfaces with at which the temperature is\ncontinuous, if the thermodynamics are frozen during the temporal integration of\nthe conserved state. Additionally, we demonstrate that the oscillations are\namplified if the specific heat at constant pressure is incorrectly evaluated\ndirectly from the NASA polynomial expressions. Instead, the mean value, which\nwe derive in this manuscript, should be used to compute the specific heat at\nconstant pressure. This can reduce the amplitude of, but not prevent,\nunphysical oscillations where the species concentrations numerically mix. We\nthen present solutions to several test cases using the total energy formulation\nand demonstrate spurious pressure oscillations were not generated for material\ninterfaces if the temperature is continuous and that it is better behaved than\nfrozen thermodynamic formulations if the temperature is discontinuous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 13:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-24"}

Bright radio emission\nfrom foreground sources remains the biggest obstacle to detecting the faint 21\ncm signal. However, the expected smoothness of foreground power leaves a clean\nwindow in Fourier space where the EoR signal can potentially be seen over\nthermal noise. Though the boundary of this window is well-defined in principle,\nspectral structure in foreground sources, instrumental chromaticity, and choice\nof spectral weighting in analysis all affect how much foreground power spills\nover into the EoR window. In this paper, we run a suite of numerical\nsimulations of wide-field visibility measurements, with a variety of diffuse\nforeground models and instrument configurations, and measure the extent of\ncontaminated Fourier modes in the EoR window using a delay-transform approach\nto estimating power spectra. We also test these effects with a model of the\nHERA antenna beam generated from electromagnetic simulations, to take into\naccount further chromatic effects in the real instrument. We find that\nforeground power spillover is dominated by the so-called \"pitchfork effect\", in\nwhich diffuse foreground power is brightened near the horizon due to the\nshortening of baselines. As a result, the extent of contaminated modes in the\nEoR window is largely constant over time, except when the galaxy is near the\npointing center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 14:15:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

The\ncompression ratio of BWT is quantified by the number $r$ of equal-letter runs.\nDespite the practical significance of BWT, no non-trivial bound on the value of\n$r$ is known. This is in contrast to nearly all other known compression\nmethods, whose sizes have been shown to be either always within a ${\\rm\npolylog}\\,n$ factor (where $n$ is the length of text) from $z$, the size of\nLempel-Ziv (LZ77) parsing of the text, or significantly larger in the worst\ncase (by a $n^{\\varepsilon}$ factor for $\\varepsilon > 0$). In this paper, we\nshow that $r = \\mathcal{O}(z \\log^2n)$ holds for every text.

In addition, we provide an $\\mathcal{O}(z\\,{\\rm\npolylog}\\,n)$-time algorithm converting the LZ77 parsing into the run-length\ncompressed BWT.

If measurement is governed by wavefunction collapse, then\ngedanken experiments show that a number of fundamental principles including\nconservation of angular momentum and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle can\nbe violated. We conclude that the collapse of the spin part of the wavefunction\ncannot happen and therefore an EPR paradox does not arise for this system. QM\nunitarity alone is sufficient to rule out \"spooky\" action at a distance. The\nabsence of spin wavefunction collapse leads to several interesting conclusions\nabout how measurement works in QM: When wavefunction collapse does not happen,\n(i) a signal from a macroscopic measuring device indicating that a system is in\na state S does not necessarily mean that it is or was in S and (ii) the\nuncertainty in QM at the microscopic level is transmitted to uncertainty in\nsignals for the macroscopic measuring device. We derive two general results on\nhow quantum measurement works and illustrate them in a spin-1/2 measurement.

The numbers and fluxes of\nexpected UHE DM particles are evaluated in the incoming energy range between 1\nEeV and 1 ZeV with the different lifetimes of decay of SHDM and mass of\n$Z^{\\prime}$. According to the Auger data from 2008 to 2019, the upper limit\nfor UHE DM fluxes is estimated at 90\\% C.L. with the FD of Auger. UHE DM\nparticles could be directly detected in the energy range between O(1EeV) and\nO(10EeV) with the FD of Auger. Thus this might prove whether there exist SHDM\nparticles in the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 07:46:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 May 2020 13:12:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 03:49:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 01:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-08"}

To address this problem, we propose a\nprivacy-preserving method for the distributed system, Stochastic Channel-Based\nFederated Learning (SCBF), which enables the participants to train a\nhigh-performance model cooperatively without sharing their inputs.\nSpecifically, we design, implement and evaluate a channel-based update\nalgorithm for the central server in a distributed system, which selects the\nchannels with regard to the most active features in a training loop and uploads\nthem as learned information from local datasets. A pruning process is applied\nto the algorithm based on the validation set, which serves as a model\naccelerator. In the experiment, our model presents better performances and\nhigher saturating speed than the Federated Averaging method which reveals all\nthe parameters of local models to the server when updating.

However,\ngraphemic ASR still has problems with rare long-tail words that do not follow\nthe standard spelling conventions seen in training, such as entity names. In\nthis work, we present a novel method to train a statistical\ngrapheme-to-grapheme (G2G) model on text-to-speech data that can rewrite an\narbitrary character sequence into more phonetically consistent forms. We show\nthat using G2G to provide alternative pronunciations during decoding reduces\nWord Error Rate by 3% to 11% relative over a strong graphemic baseline and\nbridges the gap on rare name recognition with an equivalent phonetic setup.\nUnlike many previously proposed methods, our method does not require any change\nto the acoustic model training procedure. This work reaffirms the efficacy of\ngrapheme-based modeling and shows that specialized linguistic knowledge, when\navailable, can be leveraged to improve graphemic ASR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 21:49:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 21:24:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}

For instance, how spatial networks of functional connectivity in the\nbrain evolve during a task is not well-understood. A traditional approach in\nneuroimaging data analysis is to make simplifications through the assumption of\nstatic spatial networks. In this paper, without assuming static networks in\ntime and/or space, we arrange the temporal data as a higher-order tensor and\nuse a tensor factorization model called PARAFAC2 to capture underlying patterns\n(spatial networks) in time-evolving data and their evolution. Numerical\nexperiments on simulated data demonstrate that PARAFAC2 can successfully reveal\nthe underlying networks and their dynamics.
