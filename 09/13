The concept allows execution of code but disallows\nany read access to it. Our security analysis shows that this concept is\ninsufficient for firmware protection due to the use of shared resources such as\nthe CPU and SRAM.

As more imagery collected, it is harder to narrow down\nto certain frames among thousands of video clips to a specific incident. A\nreal-time, proactive surveillance system is desirable, which could instantly\ndetect dubious personnel, identify suspicious activities, or raise momentous\nalerts. The recent proliferation of the edge computing paradigm allows more\ndata-intensive tasks to be accomplished by smart edge devices with lightweight\nbut powerful algorithms. This paper presents a forensic surveillance strategy\nby introducing an Instant Suspicious Activity identiFication at the Edge\n(I-SAFE) using fuzzy decision making. A fuzzy control system is proposed to\nmimic the decision-making process of a security officer. Decisions are made\nbased on video features extracted by a lightweight Deep Machine Learning (DML)\nmodel. Based on the requirements from the first-line law enforcement officers,\nseveral features are selected and fuzzified to cope with the state of\nuncertainty that exists in the officers' decision-making process. Using\nfeatures in the edge hierarchy minimizes the communication delay such that\ninstant alerting is achieved. Additionally, leveraging the Microservices\narchitecture, the I-SAFE scheme possesses good scalability given the increasing\ncomplexities at the network edge. Implemented as an edge-based application and\ntested using exemplary and various labeled dataset surveillance videos, the\nI-SAFE scheme raises alerts by identifying the suspicious activity in an\naverage of 0.002 seconds.

This approach makes sense when robots\nstraightforwardly optimize their objective, and enables humans to learn what\nthe robot is trying to achieve. However, our insight is that---when robots are\naware that humans learn by trusting that the robot actions are\nrational---intelligent robots do not act as the human expects; instead, they\ntake advantage of the human's trust, and exploit this trust to more efficiently\noptimize their own objective.

A grid in a double vector bundle consists of two\nlinear sections, one in each structure, and thus provides two paths from the\nbase manifold to the top space; the warp of the grid measures the lack of\ncommutativity of the two paths.\n  For a double vector bundle $D$, a linear section induces a linear map on the\nrelevant dual of $D$ and thence a linear section of the iterated dual; we call\nthis the corresponding squarecap section. This notion makes precise the\nrelationships between various standard $1$-forms and vector fields that are not\ndual in the usual sense. A grid in $D$ induces squarecap sections in the two\niterated duals. These iterated duals are themselves in duality and we obtain an\nexpression for the warp of a grid in terms of a pairing.

The switching mechanism between regimes\nis controlled by unobserved random variables that form a first-order Markov\nchain. Explicit-duration MSMs contain additional variables that explicitly\nmodel the distribution of time spent in each regime. This allows to define\nduration distributions of any form, but also to impose complex dependence\nbetween the observations and to reset the dynamics to initial conditions.\nModels that focus on the first two properties are most commonly known as hidden\nsemi-Markov models or segment models, whilst models that focus on the third\nproperty are most commonly known as changepoint models or reset models.

Recent advances in network science have yielded\nnew approaches to the mechanism by which spacetime can emerge as the ground\nstate of a simple Hamiltonian, based upon a multi-dimensional Ising model with\none dimensionless coupling constant. Extensions to this model have been\nproposed that improve the ground state geometry, but they require additional\ncoupling constants. In this paper we conduct an extensive exploration of the\ngraph properties of the ground states of these models, and a simplification\nrequiring only one coupling constant. We demonstrate that the simplification is\neffective at producing an acceptable ground state. Moreover we propose a scheme\nfor the inclusion of matter and dynamics as excitations above the ground state\nof the simplified Hamiltonian.

The classical voter model is a\nwell-established conceptual model to study such processes. In this work, we\ndefine a new form of adaptive (or co-evolutionary) voter model posed on a\nsimplicial complex, i.e., on a certain class of hypernetworks/hypergraphs. We\nuse the persuasion rule along edges of the classical voter model and the\nrecently studied re-wiring rule of edges towards like-minded nodes, and\nintroduce a new peer pressure rule applied to three nodes connected via a\n2-simplex. This simplicial adaptive voter model is studied via numerical\nsimulation. We show that adding the effect of peer pressure to an adaptive\nvoter model leaves its fragmentation transition, i.e., the transition upon\nvarying the re-wiring rate from a single majority state into to a fragmented\nstate of two different opinion subgraphs, intact. Yet, above and below the\nfragmentation transition, we observe that the peer pressure has substantial\nquantitative effects. It accelerates the transition to a single-opinion state\nbelow the transition and also speeds up the system dynamics towards\nfragmentation above the transition. Furthermore, we quantify that there is a\nmultiscale hierarchy in the model leading to the depletion of 2-simplices,\nbefore the depletion of active edges. This leads to the conjecture that many\nother dynamic network models on simplicial complexes may show a similar\nbehaviour with respect to the sequential evolution of simplicies of different\ndimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 17:13:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

To that end, we propose a framework for subgoal generation\nand planning, hierarchical visual foresight (HVF), which generates subgoal\nimages conditioned on a goal image, and uses them for planning. The subgoal\nimages are directly optimized to decompose the task into easy to plan segments,\nand as a result, we observe that the method naturally identifies semantically\nmeaningful states as subgoals. Across three out of four simulated vision-based\nmanipulation tasks, we find that our method achieves nearly a 200% performance\nimprovement over planning without subgoals and model-free RL approaches.\nFurther, our experiments illustrate that our approach extends to real,\ncluttered visual scenes.

The first approach consists of a reformulation of the\nshadow operator formalism and kinematic space techniques. We observe that the\nshadow operator associated with the stress tensor (or other conserved currents)\ncan be written as the descendant of a field ${\\cal E}$ with negative dimension.\nComputations of stress tensor contributions to conformal blocks can be\nsystematically organized in terms of the \"soft mode\" ${\\cal E}$, turning them\ninto a simple diagrammatic perturbation theory at large central charge. Our\nsecond (equivalent) approach concerns a theory of reparametrization modes,\ngeneralizing previous studies in the context of the Schwarzian theory and\ntwo-dimensional CFTs. Due to the conformal anomaly in even dimensions, gauge\nmodes of the conformal group acquire an action and are shown to exhibit the\nsame dynamics as the soft mode ${\\cal E}$ that encodes the physics of the\nstress tensor shadow. We discuss the calculation of the conformal partial waves\nor the conformal blocks using our effective field theory. The separation of\nconformal blocks from shadow blocks is related to gauging of certain symmetries\nin our effective field theory of the soft mode. These connections explain and\ngeneralize various relations between conformal blocks, shadow operators,\nkinematic space, and reparametrization modes. As an application we study\nthermal physics in higher dimensions and argue that the theory of\nreparametrization modes captures the physics of quantum chaos in Rindler space.\nThis is also supported by the observation of the pole skipping phenomenon in\nthe conformal energy-energy two-point function on Rindler space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 17:51:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 18:50:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-13"}

In particular, the\nsimulations reproduce the age-velocity dispersion relation and a\nmulti-component stellar disk as observed for the Milky Way. Half of our\ngalaxies show a double exponential vertical profile, while the others are well\ndescribed by a single exponential model which we link to the disk merger\nhistory. In all cases, mono-age populations follow a single exponential whose\nscale height varies monotonically with stellar age and radius. The scale length\ndecreases with stellar age while the scale height increases. The general\nstructure of the stellar disks is already set at time of birth as a result of\nthe inside-out and upside-down formation. Subsequent evolution modifies this\nstructure by increasing both the scale length and height of all mono-age\npopulations. Thus, our results put tight constraints on how much dynamical\nmemory stellar disks can retain over cosmological timescales. Our simulations\ndemonstrate that it is possible to form thin galactic disks in cosmological\nsimulations provided there are no significant stellar mergers at low redshifts.\nMost of the stellar mass is formed in-situ with only a few percent\n($\\lesssim5\\%$) brought in by merging satellites at early times.

Using planet distribution models\nconsistent with existing radial velocity and imaging constraints, we simulate a\nlarge sample of systems with the same stellar and disc properties to determine\nhow many planets can be detected. We find that current large (8-10m) telescopes\nhave, at most a 0.2% chance of detecting a core accretion giant planet in the\nL' band and 2% in the K band for a typical solar type star. Future instruments\nsuch as METIS and VIKiNG have higher sensitivity and are expected to detect\nexoplanets at a maximum rate of 2% and 8% respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 18:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-19"}

The ability to\ncalculate both bound and scattering states simultaneously puts these\nself-energies in a unique position to consistently describe exclusive knockout\nreactions such as $(e,e'p)$. The present analysis reveals the importance of\nhigh-energy proton reaction cross-section data in constraining spectroscopic\nfactors required for the description of the $(e,e'p)$ cross sections.

Measurements of proton reaction cross\nsections in inverse kinematics employing rare isotope beams with large neutron\nexcess will provide corresponding constraints on proton spectroscopic factors\nfor exotic nuclei. Moreover, DOM generated spectral functions indicate that the\nquenching of spectroscopic factors compared to $^{40}$Ca is not only due to\nlong-range correlation, but also partly due to the increase in high-momentum\nprotons in $^{48}$Ca on account of the strong neutron-proton interaction.\nSingle-particle momentum distributions of protons and neutrons in $^{48}$Ca\ncalculated from these spectral functions confirm that neutron excess causes a\nhigher fraction of high-momentum protons than neutrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 19:06:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 17:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}

In addition, NuSTAR broad-band measurements\nhave uncovered a much heavier intermediate polar population in the central ~100\npc than previously assumed, raising the possibility that some fraction of this\npopulation extends further from the center. Here we use NuSTAR's large aperture\nfor unfocused photons and its broad-band X-ray range to probe the diffuse\ncontinuum of the inner ~1-3$^\\circ$ of the Galactic bulge. This allows us to\nconstrain possible multi-temperature components of the spectrum, such as could\nindicate a mixture of soft and hard populations. Our emissivity is consistent\nwith previous hard X-ray measurements in the bulge and ridge, with the diffuse\nX-ray luminosity tracing the stellar mass. The spectrum is well-described by a\nsingle-temperature thermal plasma with $kT \\approx 8$ keV, with no significant\nemission above 20 keV. This supports that the bulge is dominated by quiescent\ndwarf novae; we find no evidence of a significant intermediate polar population\nin the hard X-ray band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 19:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

Numerous techniques have been proposed to\nharden machine learning algorithms and mitigate the effect of adversarial\nattacks. Of these techniques, adversarial training, which augments the training\ndata with adversarial samples, has proven to be an effective defense with\nrespect to a certain class of attacks. However, adversarial training is\ncomputationally expensive and its improvements are limited to a single model.\nIn this work, we take a first step toward creating a model-agnostic adversarial\ndefense. We propose Adversarially-Trained Autoencoder Augmentation (AAA), the\nfirst model-agnostic adversarial defense that is robust against certain\nadaptive adversaries. We show that AAA allows us to achieve a partially\nmodel-agnostic defense by training a single autoencoder to protect multiple\npre-trained classifiers; achieving adversarial performance on par or better\nthan adversarial training without modifying the classifiers. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that AAA can be used to create a fully model-agnostic defense for\nMNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets by improving the adversarial performance of a\nnever before seen pre-trained classifier by at least 45% with no additional\ntraining. Finally, using a natural image corruption dataset, we show that our\napproach improves robustness to naturally corrupted images,which has been\nidentified as strongly indicative of true adversarial robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 19:51:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 22:50:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2020 23:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-31"}

This paper deals with the design and optimized\nsynthesis of a special type of fixtures, which we call \\emph{snapping\nfixtures}. Given a polyhedral workpiece $P$ with $n$ vertices and of constant\ngenus, which we need to hold, a snapping fixture is a semi-rigid polyhedron\n$G$, made of a palm and several fingers, such that when $P$ and $G$ are well\nseparated, we can push $P$ toward $G$, slightly bending the fingers of $G$ on\nthe way (exploiting its mild flexibility), and obtain a configuration, where\n$G$ is back in its original shape and $P$ and $G$ are inseparable as rigid\nbodies. We prove the minimal closure conditions under which such fixtures can\nhold parts, using Helly's theorem. We then introduce an algorithm running in\n$O(n^3)$ time that produces a snapping fixture, minimizing the number of\nfingers and optimizing additional objectives, if a snapping fixture exists. We\nalso provide an efficient and robust implementation of a simpler version of the\nalgorithm, which produces the fixture model to be 3D printed and runs in\n$O(n^4)$ time. We describe two applications with different optimization\ncriteria: Fixtures to hold add-ons for drones, where we aim to make the fixture\nas lightweight as possible, and small-scale fixtures to hold precious stones in\njewelry, where we aim to maximize the exposure of the stones, namely minimize\nthe obscuring of the workpiece by the fixture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 21:17:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 May 2020 11:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

In addition, its excellent\nphotometric precision enables asteroseismology of solar-type and red-giant\nstars, which exhibit convection-driven, solar-like oscillations. Simulations\npredict that TESS will detect solar-like oscillations in nearly 100 stars\nalready known to host planets. In this paper, we present an asteroseismic\nanalysis of the known red-giant host stars HD 212771 and HD 203949, both\nsystems having a long-period planet detected through radial velocities. These\nare the first detections of oscillations in previously known exoplanet-host\nstars by TESS, further showcasing the mission's potential to conduct\nasteroseismology of red-giant stars. We estimate the fundamental properties of\nboth stars through a grid-based modeling approach that uses global\nasteroseismic parameters as input. We discuss the evolutionary state of HD\n203949 in depth and note the large discrepancy between its asteroseismic mass\n($M_\\ast = 1.23 \\pm 0.15\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ if on the red-giant branch or $M_\\ast\n= 1.00 \\pm 0.16\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ if in the clump) and the mass quoted in the\ndiscovery paper ($M_\\ast = 2.1 \\pm 0.1\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$), implying a change\n$>30\\,\\%$ in the planet's mass.

Finally, HD 212771 was\nobserved by K2 during its Campaign 3, thus allowing for a preliminary\ncomparison of the asteroseismic performances of TESS and K2. We estimate the\nratio of the observed oscillation amplitudes for this star to be $A_{\\rm\nmax}^{\\rm TESS}/A_{\\rm max}^{\\rm K2} = 0.75 \\pm 0.14$, consistent with the\nexpected ratio of $\\sim0.85$ due to the redder bandpass of TESS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 21:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-02"}

Current approaches to mitigating\ncompression side channels have drawbacks in that they either degrade\ncompression ratio drastically or require too much effort from developers to be\nwidely adopted. To bridge the gap, we develop Debreach, a static analysis and\nprogram transformation based approach to mitigating compression side channels.\nDebreach consists of two steps. First, it uses taint analysis to soundly\nidentify flows of sensitive data in the program and uses code instrumentation\nto annotate data before feeding them to the compressor. Second, it enhances the\ncompressor to exploit the freedom to not compress of standard compression\nprotocols, thus removing the dependency between sensitive data and the size of\nthe compressor's output. Since Debreach automatically instruments applications\nand does not change the compression protocols, it has the advantage of being\nnon-disruptive and compatible with existing systems.

What remains\npoorly explored is how the coherent excitation can affect antenna performance:\nits multipole composition, directivity, efficiency, and Purcell effect. In this\npaper, we investigate an antenna excited by two coherent sources and\ndemonstrate that this approach can boost antenna performance.

The NF-S\nexhibits three distinct elastic deformation stages under tensile, including an\ninitial homogeneous deformation, delamination, and further stretch of covalent\nbonds. The delamination process endows the NF-S extraordinary tensile\ndeformation capability, which is not accessible from its counterpart with a\nnormal cup-stacked geometry.

In this paper, we subject the analytical predictions to a more\nstringent test by simulating (i) an infinite regular array and (ii) an isolated\ncluster of 10 random emitters, using the finite element software COMSOL. In\ncase of the array, the error in apex field enhancement factor (AFEF) is found\nto be less than $0.25\\%$ for an infinite array when the lattice constant $c\n\\geq 1.5h$, increasing to $2.9\\%$ for $c = h$ and $8.1\\%$ for $c = 0.75h$. For\nan isolated random cluster of 10 emitters, the error in large AFEF values is\nfound to be small. Thus, the error in net emitted current is small for a random\ncluster compared to a regular infinite array with the same (mean) spacing. The\nline charge model thus provides a reasonable analytical tool for optimizing a\nlarge area field emitter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 05:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-06"}

However, previous work mainly focuses on the unipartite setting\nwhere signed links connect any pair of nodes. Signed bipartite networks on the\none hand, are commonly found, but have primarily been overlooked. Their\ncomplexities of having two node types where signed links can only form across\nthe two sets introduce challenges that prevent most existing literature on\nunipartite signed and unsigned bipartite networks from being applied.

Here, we use geo-architected 3D printed synthetic\ngypsum rock to show that mineral texture orientation governs the isotropy or\nanisotropy in fracture surface roughness and volumetric flow rate through\ntensile fractures. Failure load is governed by the orientation of depositional\nlayering relative to loading direction but this effect can be hidden when an\norientated mineral texture is present within the layers. We find that samples\nwith certain mineral orientations are twice as strong as the weakest samples\nand that high values of sample strength correlate with rougher fracture\nsurfaces. Mineral texture oriented parallel to the failure plane gives rise to\nanisotropic surface roughness and in turn to anisotropic flow rates. The\nuniqueness of induced fracture roughness and the degree of anisotropy is a\npotential method for assessment of the orientation and relative bonding\nstrengths of minerals in a rock.

The\ndevice for the spin XOR gate consists of three iron (Fe)/cobalt (Co)/magnesium\noxide (MgO) electrodes, i.e., two input and one output electrodes. Spins are\ninjected into the Si channel from the input electrodes whose spin angular\nmomentum corresponds to the binary input 1 or 0. The spin drift effect is\ncontrolled by a lateral electric field in the Si channel to adjust the spin\naccumulation voltages under two different parallel configurations,\ncorresponding to (1, 1) and (0, 0), so that they exhibit the same value. As a\nresult, the spin accumulation voltage detected by the output electrode exhibits\nthree different voltages, represented by an XOR gate. The one-dimensional spin\ndrift-diffusion model clearly explains the obtained XOR behavior. Charge\ncurrent detection of the spin XOR gate is also demonstrated.

LBVs strongly disturb their surroundings by\nheating and shocking, and produce important amounts of dust. The study of the\ncircumstellar material is therefore crucial to understand how these massive\nstars evolve, and also to characterize their effects onto the interstellar\nmedium. The versatility of NIKA2 is a key in providing simultaneous\nobservations of both the stellar continuum and the extended, circumstellar\ncontribution. The NIKA2 frequencies (150 and 260 GHz) are in the range where\nthermal dust and free-free emission compete, and hence NIKA2 has the capacity\nto provide key information about the spatial distribution of circumstellar\nionized gas, warm dust and nearby dark clouds; non-thermal emission is also\npossible even at these high frequencies.

However its exact computation is\noften not trivial. In particular in many latent variable models, it is\nintricated due to the presence of unobserved variables. Therefore the observed\nFIM is usually considered in this context to estimate the FIM. Several methods\nhave been proposed to approximate the observed FIM when it can not be evaluated\nanalytically. Among the most frequently used approaches are Monte-Carlo methods\nor iterative algorithms derived from the missing information principle. All\nthese methods require to compute second derivatives of the complete data\nlog-likelihood which leads to some disadvantages from a computational point of\nview. In this paper, we present a new approach to estimate the FIM in latent\nvariable model. The advantage of our method is that only the first derivatives\nof the log-likelihood is needed, contrary to other approaches based on the\nobserved FIM. Indeed we consider the empirical estimate of the covariance\nmatrix of the score. We prove that this estimate of the Fisher information\nmatrix is unbiased, consistent and asymptotically Gaussian. Moreover we\nhighlight that none of both estimates is better than the other in terms of\nasymptotic covariance matrix. When the proposed estimate can not be directly\nanalytically evaluated, we present a stochastic approximation estimation\nalgorithm to compute it. This algorithm provides this estimate of the FIM as a\nby-product of the parameter estimates. We emphasize that the proposed algorithm\nonly requires to compute the first derivatives of the complete data\nlog-likelihood with respect to the parameters. We prove that the estimation\nalgorithm is consistent and asymptotically Gaussian when the number of\niterations goes to infinity. We evaluate the finite sample size properties of\nthe proposed estimate and of the observed FIM through simulation studies in\nlinear mixed effects models and mixture models. We also investigate the\nconvergence properties of the estimation algorithm in non linear mixed effects\nmodels.

Photon stimulated desorption of adsorbed Na on\nsolid surfaces has been commonly used to explain observations at high\naltitudes. We investigate three model velocity distribution functions (VDF)\nthat have been previously used in several studies to describe the desorption of\natoms from a solid surface either by electron or by photon bombardment, namely:\nthe Maxwell-Boltzmann (M-B) distribution, the empirical distribution proposed\nby [Wurz et al., 2010] for PSD, and the Weibull distribution. We use all\navailable measurements reported by [Yakshinskiy and Madey, 2000, 2004] to test\nthese distributions and determine which one fits best (statistically) and we\ndiscuss their physical validity. Our results show that the measured VDF of\nreleased Na atoms are too narrow compared to Maxwell-Boltzmann fits with\nsupra-temperatures as suggested by [3]. We found that a good fit with M-B is\nonly achieved with a speed offset of the whole distribution to higher speeds\nand a lower temperature, with the offset and the fit temperature not showing\nany correlation with the surface temperature. From the three distributions we\nstudied, we find that the Weibull distribution provides the best fits using the\ntemperature of the surface, though an offset towards higher speeds is required.\nThis work confirms that Electron-Stimulated Desorption (ESD) and\nPhoton-Stimulated Desorption (PSD) should produce non-thermal velocity (or\nenergy) distributions of the atoms released via these processes, which is\nexpected from surface physics. We recommend to use the Weibull distribution\nwith the shape parameter kappa=1.7, the speed offset v0=575 m/s, and the\nsurface temperature to model PSD distributions at planetary bodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 09:44:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-16"}

It can be computed by\nnumerically solving a characteristic linear dynamical system but the procedure\nis computationally expensive. We take a control-theoretic approach and propose\na reduction technique that finds another dynamical system of lower dimension\n(number of variables), such that numerically solving the reduced dynamical\nsystem provides an approximation to the solution of the original system with\nguaranteed error bounds. Our technique generalises lumpability (or\nprobabilistic bisimulation) to a quantitative setting. Our main result is a\nLyapunov function characterisation of the difference in the trajectories of the\ntwo dynamics that depends on the initial mismatch and exponentially decreases\nover time. In particular, the Lyapunov function enables us to compute an error\nbound between the two dynamics as well as a convergence rate. Finally, we show\nthat the search for the reduced dynamics can be computed in polynomial time\nusing a Schur decomposition of the transition matrix. This enables us to\nefficiently solve the reduced dynamical system by computing the exponential of\nan upper-triangular matrix characterising the reduced dynamics. For CTMDPs, we\ngeneralise our approach using piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions for\nswitched affine dynamical systems.

No clear patterns are found between the\nlow-frequency eclipse widths, orbital period variations and trends in the\nintra-binary material density. Using polarisation calibrated observations we\npresent the first available limits on the strength of magnetic fields within\nthe eclipse region of this system; the average line of sight field is\nconstrained to be $10^{-4}$ G $\\lesssim B_{||} \\lesssim 10^2$ G, while for the\ncase of a field directed near-perpendicular to the line of sight we find\n$B_{\\perp} \\lesssim 0.3$ G.

Based on the\nidea of the difference between a benign sample and its adversarial example is\nmeasured by the Euclidean norm, while the difference between their\nclassification probability densities at the last (softmax) layer of the network\ncould be measured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, the explanation\nshows that the output difference is a quadratic form of the input difference.\nIf the eigenvalue of this quadratic form (a.k.a.

Various methods have\nbeen investigated extensively, but most only consider consistent rain/snow\nunder stable background scenes. Rain/snow captured from practical surveillance\ncamera, however, is always highly dynamic in time with the background scene\ntransformed occasionally. To this issue, this paper proposes a novel rain/snow\nremoval approach, which fully considers dynamic statistics of both rain/snow\nand background scenes taken from a video sequence. Specifically, the rain/snow\nis encoded as an online multi-scale convolutional sparse coding (OMS-CSC)\nmodel, which not only finely delivers the sparse scattering and multi-scale\nshapes of real rain/snow, but also well encodes their temporally dynamic\nconfigurations by real-time ameliorated parameters in the model. Furthermore, a\ntransformation operator imposed on the background scenes is further embedded\ninto the proposed model, which finely conveys the dynamic background\ntransformations, such as rotations, scalings and distortions, inevitably\nexisted in a real video sequence. The approach so constructed can naturally\nbetter adapt to the dynamic rain/snow as well as background changes, and also\nsuitable to deal with the streaming video attributed its online learning mode.\nThe proposed model is formulated in a concise maximum a posterior (MAP)\nframework and is readily solved by the ADMM algorithm. Compared with the\nstate-of-the-art online and offline video rain/snow removal methods, the\nproposed method achieves better performance on synthetic and real videos\ndatasets both visually and quantitatively. Specifically, our method can be\nimplemented in relatively high efficiency, showing its potential to real-time\nvideo rain/snow removal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 11:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-16"}

In this paper we\npropose deep optimal feedback control to learn an optimal feedback policy\nrather than a single trajectory.

Additionally, we measure the Einstein delay parameter,\n$\\gamma\\,, = \\, 0.0216(9) \\, \\rm s$.

The measurements of $\\gamma$ and the proper motion\nenable a separation of the system component masses: we obtain a pulsar mass of\n$M_{p} \\, = \\, 1.25^{+0.05}_{-0.06} \\, M_{\\odot}$ and a companion mass of\n$M_{c} \\, = \\, 1.22^{+0.06}_{-0.05} \\, M_{\\odot}$. This raises the possibility\nthat the companion is also a neutron star. Searches for radio pulsations from\nthe companion have thus far been unsuccessful, hence we cannot confirm the\nlatter hypothesis. The low mass of this millisecond pulsar - one of the lowest\never measured for such objects - clearly indicates that the recycling process\ncan be achieved with a relatively small amount of mass transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 12:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

The objective of a DCOP algorithm is to optimize\na global objective function that can be described as the aggregation of a\nnumber of distributed constraint cost functions. In a DCOP, each of these\nfunctions is defined by a set of discrete variables. However, in many\napplications, such as target tracking or sleep scheduling in sensor networks,\ncontinuous valued variables are more suited than the discrete ones.

To address single-image RGB localization, state-of-the-art\nfeature-based methods match local descriptors between a query image and a\npre-built 3D model. Recently, deep neural networks have been exploited to\nregress the mapping between raw pixels and 3D coordinates in the scene, and\nthus the matching is implicitly performed by the forward pass through the\nnetwork. However, in a large and ambiguous environment, learning such a\nregression task directly can be difficult for a single network.

Cameras may be exposed to\ndifficult weather conditions and typically require frequent maintenance. When\ndeciding the order in which maintenance should be performed, one has to\nconsider both the traveling times between the cameras and the traffic flow that\neach camera is supposed to monitor. In this paper, we study the problem of\nrouting a set of technicians to repair cameras by minimizing the total weighted\nlatency, that is, the sum of the weighted waiting times of each camera, where\nthe weight is a parameter proportional to the monitored traffic. The resulting\nproblem, called weighted k-traveling repairman problem (wkTRP), is a\ngeneralization of the well-known traveling repairman problem and can be used to\nmodel a variety of real-world applications. To solve the wkTRP, we propose an\niterated local search heuristic and an exact branch-and-cut algorithm enriched\nwith valid inequalities. The effectiveness of the two methods is proved by\nextensive computational experiments performed both on instances derived from a\nreal-world case study, as well as on benchmark instances from the literature on\nthe wkTRP and on related problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 13:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-16"}

The success of nanostructuring relies on charge carriers having\nshorter mean-free-paths than phonons so that the latter can be selectively\nscattered. Nevertheless, introducing disorder into a material often comes at\nthe expense of scattering charge carriers as well as phonons. In order to\ndetermine the tradeoff between the degradation of the lattice thermal\nconductivity and of the power factor due to this, we perform a theoretical\ninvestigation of both phonon and electron transport in nanocrystalline,\nnanoporous Si geometries. We use molecular dynamics for phonon transport\ncalculations and the non-equilibrium Green's function method for electronic\ntransport. We report on the engineering tradeoff that the porosity (number of\npores and their in-between distance) has on the overall thermoelectric\nperformance for the material optimization. We indeed find that the reduction in\nthermal conductivity is stronger compared to the reduction in the power factor,\nfor the low porosities considered in this study (up to 5 %), and that the ZT\nfigure of merit can experience a large increase, especially when grain\nboundaries are included, compared to just nanoporosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 13:58:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-16"}

For\nwider application of this methodology, efficient ways to generate the\nunderlying full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) and the\ncorresponding energy gradients are required. Recently, we have proposed a fully\nautomated procedure based on combining the original RPMDrate code with active\nlearning for PES on-the-fly using moment tensor potential and successfully\napplied it to two representative thermally activated chemical reactions [I. S.\nNovikov, Y. V. Suleimanov, A. V. Shapeev, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 29503-29512\n(2018)]. In this work, using a prototype insertion chemical reaction S + H$_2$,\nwe show that this procedure works equally well for another class of chemical\nreactions. We find that the corresponding PES can be generated by fitting to\nless than 1500 automatically generated structures while the RPMD rate\ncoefficients show deviation from the reference values within the typical\nconvergence error of RPMDrate. We note that more structures are accumulated\nduring the real-time propagation of the dynamic factor (the recrossing factor)\nas opposed to the previous study. We also observe that relatively flat free\nenergy profile of the along the reaction coordinate before entering the\ncomplex-formation well can cause issues with locating the maximum of the free\nenergy surface for less converged PESs. However, the final RPMD rate\ncoefficient is independent of the position of the dividing surface that makes\nit invulnerable to this problem, keeping the total number of necessary\nstructures within a few thousand. Our work concludes that, in future, the\nproposed methodology can be applied to realistic complex chemical reactions\nwith various energy profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 14:14:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:40:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 15:45:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

The image-based identification of distinct tissues within\ndermatological wounds enhances patients' care since it requires no intrusive\nevaluations.

QTDU consists of a three-stage pipeline for the obtaining of ulcer\nsegmentation, tissues' labeling, and wounded area quantification.

The method is tested\nagainst N-body simulations run with standard and $f(R)$ gravity: we rely on the\nresults of a friends-of-friends code run on the N-body snapshots to assign\nparticles to halos, then compute the halo power spectrum.

To this end, we study\nthe renormalization group flow of a Fierz-complete set of four-quark\ninteractions and monitor their strength at finite temperature and quark\nchemical potential. At small quark chemical potential, we find that the\nscalar-pseudoscalar interaction channel is dynamically rendered most dominant\nby the gauge degrees of freedom, indicating the formation of a chiral\ncondensate. Moreover, the inclusion of quark-gluon interactions leaves a\nsignificant imprint on the dynamics as measured by the curvature of the\nfinite-temperature phase boundary which we find to be in accordance with\nlattice QCD results. At large quark chemical potential, we then observe that\nthe dominance pattern of the four-quark couplings is changed by the underlying\nquark-gluon dynamics, without any fine-tuning of the four-quark couplings. In\nthis regime, the scalar-pseudoscalar interaction channel becomes subleading and\nthe dominance pattern suggests the formation of a chirally symmetric diquark\ncondensate.

Resolvent analysis identifies the flow\nresponse to harmonic forcing, given a steady base state, in terms of the\nresponse and forcing modes and the amplification gain. The response and forcing\nmodes reveal the spatial structures associated with this amplification process.\nIn this study, we perform resolvent analysis on both laminar and turbulent\nflows over a rectangular cavity with length-to-depth ratio of $L/D=6$ at a free\nstream Mach number of $M_\\infty=0.6$ in a spanwise periodic setting. Based on\nthe dominant instability of the base state, a discount parameter is introduced\nto resolvent analysis to examine the harmonic characteristics over a\nfinite-time window. We first uncover the underlying flow physics and interpret\nfindings from laminar flow at $Re_D = 502$. These findings from laminar flow\nare extended to a more practical cavity flow example at a much higher Reynolds\nnumber of $Re_D = 10^4$. The features of response and forcing modes from the\nlaminar and turbulent cavity flows are similar to the spatial structures from\nthe laminar analysis. We further find that the large amplification of energy in\nflow response is associated with high frequency for turbulent flow, while the\nflow is more responsive to low frequency excitation in the laminar case. These\nfindings from resolvent analysis provide valuable insights for flow control\nstudies with regard to parameter selection and placement of actuators and\nsensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 15:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-16"}

The presence of short-lived radionuclides, as evidenced\nby their decay products in meteorites, has been used to suggest that\nparticular, sometimes exotic, stellar sources were proximal to the Sun's birth\nenvironment. The recent confirmation of neutron star - neutron star (NS-NS)\nmergers and associated kilonovae as potentially dominant sources of r-process\nnuclides can be tested in the case of the solar birth environment using the\nrelative abundances of the longer-lived nuclides. Critical analysis of the 15\nradionuclides and their stable partners for which abundances and production\nratios are well known suggests that the Sun formed in a typical massive\nstar-forming region (SFR). The apparent overabundances of short-lived\nradionuclides (e.g.\\, $^{26} {\\rm Al}$, $^{41}{\\rm Ca}$, $^{36}{\\rm Cl}$) in\nthe early solar system appears to be an artifact of a heretofore\nunder-appreciation for the important influences of enrichment by Wolf-Rayet\nwinds in SFRs. The long-lived nuclides (e.g.\\, $^{238}{\\rm U}$, $^{244}{\\rm\nPu}$, $^{247}{\\rm Cr}$, $^{129}{\\rm I}$) are consistent with an average time\ninterval between production events of $10^8$ years, seemingly too short to be\nthe products of NS-NS mergers alone. The relative abundances of all of these\nnuclides can be explained by their mean decay lifetimes and an average\nresidence time in the ISM of $\\sim200$ Myr. This residence time evidenced by\nthe radionuclides is consistent with the average lifetime of dust in the ISM\nand the timescale for converting molecular cloud mass to stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 02:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

In these analyses, it is necessary to obtain an\nanatomically correct surface parcellation scheme in an individual brain by\nreferring to the given atlas. Traditional ways to accomplish this goal are\nthrough a designed surface-based registration or hand-crafted surface features,\nalthough both of them are time-consuming. A recent deep learning approach\ndepends on a regular spherical parameterization of the mesh, which is\ncomputationally prohibitive in some cases and may also demand further\npost-processing to refine the network output. Therefore, an accurate and\nfully-automatic cortical surface parcellation scheme directly working on the\noriginal brain surfaces would be highly advantageous. In this study, we propose\nan end-to-end deep brain cortical parcellation network, called \\textbf{DBPN}.\nThrough intrinsic and extrinsic graph convolution kernels, DBPN dynamically\ndeciphers neighborhood graph topology around each vertex and encodes the\ndeciphered knowledge into node features. Eventually, a non-linear mapping\nbetween the node features and parcellation labels is constructed.
