The redox state of the magma ocean controls\nboth the chemical composition of the outgassed volatiles and the hydrogen\nisotopic composition of water oceans that remain after hydrogen loss from the\nprimordial atmosphere.

Curtailment is stopping when the final go or no-go decision is\ncertain, so-called non-stochastic curtailment, or very likely, known as\nstochastic curtailment.\n  In the context of single-arm phase II oncology trials, stochastic curtailment\nhas previously been restricted to stopping in the second stage and/or stopping\nfor a no-go decision only. We introduce two designs that incorporate stochastic\ncurtailment and allow stopping after every observation, for either a go or\nno-go decision. We obtain optimal stopping boundaries by searching over a range\nof potential conditional powers, beyond which the trial will stop for a go or\nno-go decision. This search is novel: firstly, the search is undertaken over a\nrange of values unique to each possible design realisation. Secondly, these\nvalues are evaluated taking into account the possibility of early stopping.\nFinally, each design realisation's operating characteristics are obtained\nexactly.\n  The proposed designs are compared to existing designs in a real data example.\nThey are also compared under three scenarios, both with respect to four single\noptimality criteria and using a loss function.\n  The proposed designs are superior in almost all cases.

This helps the user to throw away the original images and\nkeep the compressed images instead without noticeable loss of classification\naccuracy. We propose a cost function whose minimization can be interpreted as\nrate-distortion optimization in information theory. We also propose quantized\nFisherfaces for facial analysis in QFDA.

Here we introduce a generic way to incorporate heterogeneous grain\nalignment into synthetic polarization observations of molecular clouds, through\na simple model where the grain alignment efficiency depends on the local gas\ndensity as a power-law.

We discuss a microscopic mechanism whereby\nthe combined perturbative effects of orbital repulsion and antiferromagnetic\nHeisenberg spin interactions leads to ferro-octupolar coupling between\nneighboring sites, and stabilizes ferro-octupolar order for a face-centered\ncubic lattice.

The standard strategy is\nto first map the data into a high dimensional feature space using kernels prior\nto a projection onto a low dimensional space. While KDR methods can be easily\nsolved by keeping the most dominant eigenvectors of the kernel matrix, its\nfeatures are no longer easy to interpret. Alternatively, Interpretable KDR\n(IKDR) is different in that it projects onto a subspace \\textit{before} the\nkernel feature mapping, therefore, the projection matrix can indicate how the\noriginal features linearly combine to form the new features. Unfortunately, the\nIKDR objective requires a non-convex manifold optimization that is difficult to\nsolve and can no longer be solved by eigendecomposition. Recently, an efficient\niterative spectral (eigendecomposition) method (ISM) has been proposed for this\nobjective in the context of alternative clustering. However, ISM only provides\ntheoretical guarantees for the Gaussian kernel. This greatly constrains ISM's\nusage since any kernel method using ISM is now limited to a single kernel. This\nwork extends the theoretical guarantees of ISM to an entire family of kernels,\nthereby empowering ISM to solve any kernel method of the same objective. In\nidentifying this family, we prove that each kernel within the family has a\nsurrogate $\\Phi$ matrix and the optimal projection is formed by its most\ndominant eigenvectors.

By the fundamental result of the\ntheory \\cite{V5} such a linear connection must be metrical with respect to the\naveraged Riemannian metric given by integration of the Riemann-Finsler metric\non the indicatrix hypersurfaces. Therefore the linear connection (preserving\nthe Finslerian length of tangent vectors) is uniquely determined by its\ntorsion. If the torsion is zero then we have a classical Berwald manifold.\nOtherwise, the torsion is a strange data we need to express in terms of the\nintrinsic quantities of the Finsler manifold. In the paper we consider the\nextremal compatible linear connection of a generalized Berwald manifold by\nminimizing the pointwise length of its torsion tensor. It is a conditional\nextremum problem involving functions defined on a local neighbourhood of the\ntangent manifold. In case of a given point of the manifold, the reference\nelement method provides that the number of the Lagrange multipliers equals to\nthe number of the equations providing the compatibility of the linear\nconnection to the Finslerian metric. Therefore the solution of the conditional\nextremum problem with a reference element can be expressed in terms of the\ncanonical data. The solution of the conditional extremum problem independently\nof the reference elements can be constructed algorithmically at each point of\nthe manifold. The pointwise solutions constitute a section of the torsion\ntensor bundle for testing the compatibility of the corresponding linear\nconnection to the Finslerian metric. In other words, we have an intrinsic\nalgorithm to check the existence of compatible linear connections on a Finsler\nmanifold because it is equivalent to the existence of the extremal compatible\nlinear connection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 19:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

Additionally, one has to\nmarginalise over several nuisance parameters of the galaxy-halo connection.\nHowever, the computational cost of such simulations prohibits naive\nimplementations of stochastic posterior sampling methods like Markov chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) that would require of order $\\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ samples in\ncosmological parameter space. Several groups have proposed surrogate models as\na solution: a so-called emulator is trained to reproduce observables for a\nlimited number of realisations in parameter space. Afterwards, this emulator is\nused as a surrogate model in an MCMC analysis. Here, we demonstrate a different\nmethod called Cosmological Evidence Modelling (CEM). First, for each\nsimulation, we calculate the Bayesian evidence marginalised over the\ngalaxy-halo connection by repeatedly populating the simulation with galaxies.\nWe show that this Bayesian evidence is directly related to the posterior\nprobability of cosmological parameters. Finally, we build a physically\nmotivated model for how the evidence depends on cosmological parameters as\nsampled by the simulations. We demonstrate the feasibility of CEM by using\nsimulations from the Aemulus simulation suite and forecasting cosmological\nconstraints from BOSS CMASS measurements of redshift-space distortions. Our\nanalysis includes an exploration of how galaxy assembly bias affects\ncosmological inference. Overall, CEM has several potential advantages over the\nmore common approach of emulating summary statistics, including the ability to\neasily marginalise over highly complex models of the galaxy-halo connection and\ngreater accuracy, thereby reducing the number of simulations required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 19:56:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

Recently, it has been suggested that one might use such a set-up\nas a parametric quantum circuit with possibly some other goal than reaching\nground states. From this perspective, a recent work [S. Lloyd,\narXiv:1812.11075] argued that for one-dimensional local cost Hamiltonians,\ncomposed of nearest neighbor ZZ terms, this set-up is quantum computationally\nuniversal, i.e., all unitaries can be reached up to arbitrary precision. In the\npresent paper, we give the complete proof of this statement and the precise\nconditions under which such a one-dimensional QAOA might be considered\nuniversal. We further generalize this type of universality for certain cost\nHamiltonians with ZZ and ZZZ terms arranged according to the adjacency\nstructure of certain graphs and hypergraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 20:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-08"}

Also similar\nto the quantum-mechanical spin, the valley quantum number is not a conserved\nquantity.

We run a series of idealized high-resolution\nnumerical simulations, and find that cool gas develops even when the overall\nSNe heating rate $H$ exceeds the cooling rate $C$ by a factor as large as 1.4.\nWe also find that the time for multiphase gas development depends on the gas\ntemperature.

In the event of a core-collapse supernova within our\ngalaxy, multiple current and future neutrino detectors would see a large burst\nin activity. Neutrinos escape a supernova hours before light does, so any\nprompt information about the supernova's direction that can be inferred via the\nneutrino signal will help to enable early electromagnetic observations of the\nsupernova. While there are methods to determine the direction via intrinsic\ndirectionality of some neutrino-matter interaction channels, a complementary\nmethod which will reach maturity with the next generation of large neutrino\ndetectors is the use of relative neutrino arrival times at different detectors\naround the globe. To evaluate this triangulation method for realistic detector\nconfigurations of the next few decades, we generate random supernova neutrino\nsignals with realistic detector assumptions, and quantify the error in expected\ntime delay between detections. We investigate a practical and robust method of\nestimating the time differences between burst detections, also correcting for\ndetection efficiency bias. With this method, we determine the pointing\nprecision of supernova neutrino triangulation as a function of supernova\ndistance and location, detectors used, detector background level and neutrino\nmass ordering assumption.

Moreover, the ability to change circumstances (a better\neducation, improved credentials) should not be limited to only those with\naccess to expensive resources. In other words, \\emph{recourse} for negative\ndecisions should be considered a desirable value that can be equalized across\n(demographically defined) groups. This paper describes how to build models that\nmake accurate predictions while still ensuring that the penalties for a\nnegative outcome do not disadvantage different groups disproportionately.

Given a specific scenario, rich human expertise and\ntremendous laborious trials are usually required to identify a suitable GNN\narchitecture. It is because the performance of a GNN architecture is\nsignificantly affected by the choice of graph convolution components, such as\naggregate function and hidden dimension. Neural architecture search (NAS) has\nshown its potential in discovering effective deep architectures for learning\ntasks in image and language modeling. However, existing NAS algorithms cannot\nbe directly applied to the GNN search problem. First, the search space of GNN\nis different from the ones in existing NAS work. Second, the representation\nlearning capacity of GNN architecture changes obviously with slight\narchitecture modifications. It affects the search efficiency of traditional\nsearch methods. Third, widely used techniques in NAS such as parameter sharing\nmight become unstable in GNN.\n  To bridge the gap, we propose the automated graph neural networks (AGNN)\nframework, which aims to find an optimal GNN architecture within a predefined\nsearch space. A reinforcement learning based controller is designed to greedily\nvalidate architectures via small steps. AGNN has a novel parameter sharing\nstrategy that enables homogeneous architectures to share parameters, based on a\ncarefully-designed homogeneity definition.

Different from existing policy gradient methods which\nemploy single actor-critic but cannot realize satisfactory tracking control\naccuracy and stable learning, our proposed algorithm can achieve high-level\ntracking control accuracy of AUVs and stable learning by applying a hybrid\nactors-critics architecture, where multiple actors and critics are trained to\nlearn a deterministic policy and action-value function, respectively.\nSpecifically, for the critics, the expected absolute Bellman error based\nupdating rule is used to choose the worst critic to be updated in each time\nstep. Subsequently, to calculate the loss function with more accurate target\nvalue for the chosen critic, Pseudo Q-learning, which uses sub-greedy policy to\nreplace the greedy policy in Q-learning, is developed for continuous action\nspaces, and Multi Pseudo Q-learning (MPQ) is proposed to reduce the\noverestimation of action-value function and to stabilize the learning. As for\nthe actors, deterministic policy gradient is applied to update the weights, and\nthe final learned policy is defined as the average of all actors to avoid large\nbut bad updates. Moreover, the stability analysis of the learning is given\nqualitatively. The effectiveness and generality of the proposed MPQ-based\nDeterministic Policy Gradient (MPQ-DPG) algorithm are verified by the\napplication on AUV with two different reference trajectories.

An important\nquestion arising in this regards is how to choose the optimal measurement\nstrategy to achieve the highest possible decay rate. Here we rigorously prove\nthe universal optimality of the stroboscopic measurement protocol in the sense\nthat it always provides the shortest expected decay time among all measurement\nprocedures. However, the implementation of the stroboscopic protocol requires\nthe knowledge of the optimal sampling period which may depend on the fine\ndetails of the quantum problem. We show that this difficulty can be overcame\nwith the simple non-regular measurement procedures inspired by the scale-free\nrestart strategies used to speed up the completion of random search tasks and\nprobabilistic algorithms in computer science.

Due to the large intra-class\nstructural diversity, building and modeling flexible structural layout to adapt\nvarious image characteristics is a challenge. Existing structural modeling\nmethods in scene recognition either focus on predefined grids or rely on\nlearned prototypes, which all have limited representative ability. In this\npaper, we propose Prototype-agnostic Scene Layout (PaSL) construction method to\nbuild the spatial structure for each image without conforming to any prototype.\nOur PaSL can flexibly capture the diverse spatial characteristic of scene\nimages and have considerable generalization capability. Given a PaSL, we build\nLayout Graph Network (LGN) where regions in PaSL are defined as nodes and two\nkinds of independent relations between regions are encoded as edges. The LGN\naims to incorporate two topological structures (formed in spatial and semantic\nsimilarity dimensions) into image representations through graph convolution.\nExtensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results\non widely recognized MIT67 and SUN397 datasets without multi-model or\nmulti-scale fusion. Moreover, we also conduct the experiments on one of the\nlargest scale datasets, Places365.

We show that LSVs\nemerge in the convection zone from upscale energy transfers and can penetrate\ninto the stratified layer.

However, the poor safety\nissue and undesired lithium dendrites growth hinder the development of lithium\nmetal batteries. The application of solid state electrolytes has attracted\nincreasing attention as they can solve the safety issue and partly inhibit the\ngrowth of lithium dendrites. Polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based electrolytes are\nvery promising due to their enhanced safety and excellent flexibility. However,\nPEO-based electrolytes suffer from low ionic conductivity at room temperature\nand can't effectively inhibit lithium dendrites at high temperature due to the\nintrinsic semi-crystalline properties and poor mechanical strength. In this\nwork, a novel coral-like Li6.25Al0.25La3Zr2O12 (LALZO) is synthesized to use as\nan active ceramic filler in PEO. The PEO with LALZO coral (PLC) exhibits\nincreased ionic conductivity and mechanical strength, which leads to the\nuniform deposition/stripping of lithium metal. The Li symmetric cells with PLC\ncycle for 1500 h without short circuit at 50 centidegree. The assembled\nLiFePO4/PLC/Li batteries display excellent cycling stability at both 60 and 50\ncentidegree.

In this paper, we propose to exploit the\nproposal-proposal relations using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). First,\nwe construct an action proposal graph, where each proposal is represented as a\nnode and their relations between two proposals as an edge. Here, we use two\ntypes of relations, one for capturing the context information for each proposal\nand the other one for characterizing the correlations between distinct actions.\nThen we apply the GCNs over the graph to model the relations among different\nproposals and learn powerful representations for the action classification and\nlocalization.

Starting with\nan output produced by a factorized model, we iteratively refine it using a\nrefinement network. Instead of modeling arbitrary interactions among roles and\nwords, we encode prior knowledge about the SRL problem by designing a\nrestricted network architecture capturing non-local interactions.

We empirically show its\neffectiveness in recognizing various context-free grammars (CFGs). First, we\ndevelop the underlying mechanics of the proposed higher order recurrent network\nand its manipulation of a stack as well as how to stably program its underlying\npushdown automaton (PDA) to achieve desired finite-state network dynamics.\nNext, we introduce a noise regularization scheme for higher-order (tensor)\nnetworks, to our knowledge the first of its kind, and design an algorithm for\nimproved incremental learning. Finally, we design a method for inserting\ngrammar rules into a NSPDA and empirically show that this prior knowledge\nimproves its training convergence time by an order of magnitude and, in some\ncases, leads to better generalization.

In particular, one of the\nmain challenges is to tackle the problem in an unsupervised manner. In this\npaper we propose an unsupervised framework for bitemporal heterogeneous change\ndetection based on the comparison of affinity matrices and image regression.\nFirst, our method quantifies the similarity of affinity matrices computed from\nco-located image patches in the two images. This is done to automatically\nidentify pixels that are likely to be unchanged. With the identified pixels as\npseudo-training data, we learn a transformation to map the first image to the\ndomain of the other image, and vice versa. Four regression methods are selected\nto carry out the transformation: Gaussian process regression, support vector\nregression, random forest regression, and a recently proposed kernel regression\nmethod called homogeneous pixel transformation. To evaluate the potentials and\nlimitations of our framework, and also the benefits and disadvantages of each\nregression method, we perform experiments on two real data sets. The results\nindicate that the comparison of the affinity matrices can already be considered\na change detection method by itself. However, image regression is shown to\nimprove the results obtained by the previous step alone and produces accurate\nchange detection maps despite of the heterogeneity of the multitemporal input\ndata. Notably, the random forest regression approach excels by achieving\nsimilar accuracy as the other methods, but with a significantly lower\ncomputational cost and with fast and robust tuning of hyperparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Sep 2019 12:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In this paper, we develop a minimal\nmodel capturing all three types of self-propulsion trajectories of a drop in\nthe case of a nematic LC with homeotropic anchoring at LC-fluid interface. We\nemulate the director field within the drop by a single preferred polarization\nvector that is subject of two reorientation mechanisms, namely, the internal\nflow-induced displacement of the hedgehog defect and the droplet's rotation.\nWithin this reduced-order model, the coupling between the nematic ordering of\nthe drop and the surfactant transport is represented by variations of the\ndroplet's interfacial properties with nematic polarization. Our analysis\nreveals that a novel mode of orientational instability emerges from the\ncompetition of the two reorientation mechanisms and is characterized by a\nspontaneous rotation of the self-propelling drop responsible for helical\nself-propulsion trajectories. In turn, we also show that random trajectories in\nisotropic and nematic drops alike stem from the advection-driven transition to\nchaos.
