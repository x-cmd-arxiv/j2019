Instead, we model the complementarities as proportional to the buyer's\nbase valuations, and these proportionalities are known market parameters.\n  Our goal is to design a simple pricing scheme that, for a single buyer with\nproportional complementarities, yields approximately optimal revenue. We define\na new class of mechanisms where some number of items are given away for free,\nand the remaining items are sold separately at inflated prices. We find that\nthe better of such a mechanism and selling the grand bundle earns a\n12-approximation to the optimal revenue for pairwise proportional\ncomplementarities.

Here, I investigate the analytical implementation and impact of\nnon-Gaussian covariance terms that I previously derived for galaxy clustering.\nBraiding covariance is such a class of terms and it gets contribution both from\nin-survey and super-survey modes. I present an approximation for braiding\ncovariance which speeds up the numerical computation. I show that including\nbraiding covariance is a necessary condition for including other non-Gaussian\nterms: the in-survey 2-, 3- and 4-halo covariance, which yield covariance\nmatrices with negative eigenvalues if considered on their own. I then quantify\nthe impact on parameter constraints, with forecasts for a Euclid-like survey.\nCompared to the Gaussian case, braiding and in-survey covariances significantly\nincrease the error bars on cosmological parameters, in particular by 50% for w.\nThe Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) error bars are also affected between 12%\nand 39%. Accounting for super-sample covariance (SSC) also increases parameter\nerrors, by 90% for w and between 7% and 64% for HOD. In total, non-Gaussianity\nincreases the error bar on w by 120% (between 15% and 80% for other\ncosmological parameters), and the error bars on HOD parameters between 17% and\n85%. Accounting for the 1-halo trispectrum term on top of SSC is not sufficient\nfor capturing the full non-Gaussian impact: braiding and the rest of in-survey\ncovariance have to be accounted for.

We show recursive feasibility of the MPC optimization problem,\nwhere some of the developed techniques are also applicable for the analysis of\na more general class of system. Besides, we provide performance results and\nillustrate the achieved performance by numerical simulations. We thereby show\nthat the economic MPC algorithm outperforms a standard lateral undulation\ncontroller and achieves constraint satisfaction. Surprisingly, a gait pattern\ndifferent to lateral undulation results from the optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2019 16:47:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 18:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Through optical follow-up for two sources, we find\nthat in all detections the HI gas is associated with the AGN, and hence that\nthese AGN are obscured by material within their host galaxies. Most of our\nsample are compact, and in addition, are either gigahertz peaked spectrum\n(GPS), or steep spectrum (CSS) sources, both thought to represent young or\nrecently re-triggered radio AGN. The radio spectral energy distribution\nclassifications for our sample agree with galaxy evolution models in which the\nobscured AGN has only recently become active. Our associated HI detection rate\nfor GPS and compact SS sources matches those of other surveys towards such\nsources. We also find shallow and asymmetric HI absorption features, which\nagrees with previous findings that the cold neutral medium in compact radio\ngalaxies is typically kinematically disturbed by the AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2019 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

When young star\nclusters detonate supernovae in the interstellar medium (ISM) of a galaxy, they\ngenerate hot, diffuse bubbles that push on the surrounding ISM and evaporate\nthat ISM into their interiors. As these bubbles reach the scale height of the\nISM, they break out of the disc, rising into the CGM. Once these bubbles break\nout, if they have sufficiently high entropy, they will feel an upward\nacceleration, owing to a local buoyant force. This upward force will accelerate\nthese bubbles, driving them to high galactocentric radii, keeping them in the\nCGM for $>\\Gyr$, even if their initial velocity is much lower than the local\nescape velocity. We derive an equation of motion for these entropy-driven winds\nthat connects the ISM properties, halo mass, and CGM profile of galaxies to the\nultimate evolution of feedback-driven winds.

The aim of this work is to describe excitation\nenergies, transition rates, radii, and two-neutron separation energies for the\neven-even 94-110Zr nuclei and, moreover, to obtain information about wave\nfunctions and deformation. The interacting boson model with configuration\nmixing will be the framework to study the even-even Zr nuclei, considering only\ntwo types of configurations: 0particle-0hole and 2p-2h excitations. On one\nhand, the parameters appearing in the Hamiltonian and in the E2 transition\noperator are fixed trough a least-squares fit to the whole available\nexperimental information. On the other hand, once the parameters have been\nfixed, the calculations allow to obtain a complete set of observables for the\nwhole even-even Zr chain of isotopes.

Moreover, a\ndetailed study of the wave function has been conducted and mean-field energy\nsurfaces and deformation have been computed too. The importance of shape\ncoexistence has been shown to correctly describe the A~100 mass area for\neven-even Zr nuclei. This work confirmed the rather spherical nature of the\nground state of 94-98Zr and its deformed nature for 100-110Zr isotopes. The\nsudden onset of deformation in 100Zr is owing to the rapid lowering of a\ndeformed (intruder) configuration which is high-lying in lighter isotopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2019 18:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

Here,\nwe report the results for a quasar pair ($z=3.020,3.008$; $i=21.84,22.15$),\nseparated by 11.6 arcsec (or 89 projected kpc). MUSE reveals filamentary\nLy$\\alpha$ structures extending between the two quasars with an average surface\nbrightness of SB$_{\\rm Ly\\alpha}=1.8\\times10^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$\narcsec$^{-2}$. Photoionization models of the constraints in the Ly$\\alpha$,\nHeII, and CIV line emissions show that the emitting structures are\nintergalactic bridges with an extent between $\\sim89$ and up to $\\sim600$ kpc.\nOur models rule out the possibility that the structure extends for $\\sim 2.9$\nMpc, i.e., the separation inferred from the uncertain systemic redshift\ndifference of the quasars if the difference was only due to the Hubble flow. At\nthe current spatial resolution and surface brightness limit, the average\nprojected width of an individual bridge is about 35 kpc. We also detect a\nstrong absorption in HI, NV, and CIV along the background sight-line at higher\n$z$, which we interpret as due to at least two components of cool, metal\nenriched, and relatively ionized CGM or IGM surrounding the quasar pair. Two\nadditional HI absorbers are detected along both quasar sight-lines at $\\sim\n-900$ and $-2800$ km s$^{-1}$ from the system, with the latter having\nassociated CIV absorption only along the foreground quasar sight-line. The\nabsence of galaxies in the MUSE field of view at the redshifts of these two\nabsorbers suggests that they trace large-scale structures or expanding shells\nin front of the quasar pair.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2019 18:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

One of the\napproaches consists of performing calculations on factor graphs (if it is\npossible) rather than on the full graph, which is more computationally\nefficient. The Kronecker product of the graphs appears to be a natural choice\nfor a graph decomposition. However, this idea is not straightforwardly\napplicable for GCRF, since characterizing a Laplacian spectrum of the Kronecker\nproduct of graphs, which GCRF is based on, from spectra of its factor graphs\nhas remained an open problem.

Characterizing the hosting capacity (HC) is\nvital for assessing the total amount of distributed generations that a grid can\nhold before upgrading. For analyzing HC, some methods conduct extensive\nsimulations, lacking theoretical guarantees and can time-consuming. Therefore,\nthere are also methods employing optimization over all necessary operation\nconstraints. But, the complexity and inherent non-convexity lead to non-optimal\nsolutions. To solve these problems, this paper provides a constructive model\nfor HC determination. Based on geometrically obtained globally optimal HC, we\nconstruct HC solutions sequentially according to realistic constraints, so that\nwe can obtain optimal solution even with non-convex model. For practical\nadaption, we also consider three-phase unbalance condition and parallel\ncomputation to speed-up.

Current solutions for computing LE require full access to\nthe past visits of users to locations, which poses privacy threats. This paper\ndiscusses, for the first time, the problem of perturbing location entropy for a\nset of locations according to differential privacy. The problem is challenging\nbecause removing a single user from the dataset will impact multiple records of\nthe database; i.e., all the visits made by that user to various locations.\nTowards this end, we first derive non-trivial, tight bounds for both local and\nglobal sensitivity of LE, and show that to satisfy $\\epsilon$-differential\nprivacy, a large amount of noise must be introduced, rendering the published\nresults useless. Hence, we propose a thresholding technique to limit the number\nof users' visits, which significantly reduces the perturbation error but\nintroduces an approximation error. To achieve better utility, we extend the\ntechnique by adopting two weaker notions of privacy: smooth sensitivity\n(slightly weaker) and crowd-blending (strictly weaker).

We find that the resulting polar density\ngradient dramatically alters the Bondi result and gives rise to steady state\nsolutions presenting bipolar outflows. As the density contrast increases, more\nand more material is ejected from the system, attaining speeds larger than the\nlocal escape velocities for even modest density contrasts.

First, we propose an energy\ndemand learning (EDL)-based prediction solution in which a charging station\nprovider (CSP) gathers information from all charging stations (CSs) and then\nperforms the EDL algorithm to predict the energy demand for the considered\narea. However, this approach requires frequent data sharing between the CSs and\nthe CSP, thereby driving communication overhead and privacy issues for the EVs\nand CSs. To address this problem, we propose a federated energy demand learning\n(FEDL) approach which allows the CSs sharing their information without\nrevealing real datasets.

In this case, we can significantly reduce the\ncommunication overhead and effectively protect data privacy for the EV users.\nTo further improve the effectiveness of the FEDL, we then introduce a novel\nclustering-based EDL approach for EV networks by grouping the CSs into clusters\nbefore applying the EDL algorithms.

The\nreliability performance is characterized by the density of concurrent\ntransmissions that satisfy a certain reliability (outage) constraint and the\ndelay performance by so-called local delay, defined as the average number of\ntime slots required to successfully transmit a packet. We concentrate on the\nultrareliable regime where the target outage probability is close to 0. BWP has\ntwo conflicting effects: while the interference is reduced as the concurrent\ntransmissions are divided over multiple frequency bands, the\nsignal-to-interference ratio (SIR) requirement is increased due to smaller\nallocated bandwidth if the data rate is to be kept constant. Instead, if the\nSIR requirement is to be kept the same, BWP reduces the data rate and in turn\nincreases the local delay.

First, by\nextending randomized CD to nonsmooth nonconvex settings, we develop a\ncoordinate subgradient method that randomly updates block-coordinate variables\nby using block composite subgradient mapping. This method converges\nasymptotically to critical points with proven sublinear convergence rate for\ncertain optimality measures. Second, we develop a randomly permuted CD method\nwith two alternating steps: linearizing the concave part and cycling through\nvariables. We prove asymptotic convergence to critical points and sublinear\ncomplexity rate for objectives with both smooth and concave parts. Third, we\nextend accelerated coordinate descent (ACD) to nonsmooth and nonconvex\noptimization to develop a novel randomized proximal DC algorithm whereby we\nsolve the subproblem inexactly by ACD. Convergence is guaranteed with at most a\nfew number of ACD iterations for each DC subproblem, and convergence complexity\nis established for identification of some approximate critical points. Fourth,\nwe further develop the third method to minimize certain ill-conditioned\nnonconvex functions: weakly convex functions with high Lipschitz constant to\nnegative curvature ratios. We show that, under specific criteria, the ACD-based\nrandomized method has superior complexity compared to conventional gradient\nmethods. Finally, an empirical study on sparsity-inducing learning models\ndemonstrates that CD methods are superior to gradient-based methods for certain\nlarge-scale problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 02:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-15"}

Toward addressing these problems, this paper\nproposes bootstrapping a dialogue response generator with an adversarially\ntrained discriminator. The method involves training a neural generator in both\nautoregressive and traditional teacher-forcing modes, with the maximum\nlikelihood loss of the auto-regressive outputs weighted by the score from a\nmetric-based discriminator model. The discriminator input is a mixture of\nground truth labels, the teacher-forcing outputs of the generator, and\ndistractors sampled from the dataset, thereby allowing for richer feedback on\nthe autoregressive outputs of the generator. To improve the calibration of the\ndiscriminator output, we also bootstrap the discriminator with the matching of\nthe intermediate features of the ground truth and the generator's\nautoregressive output. We explore different sampling and adversarial policy\noptimization strategies during training in order to understand how to encourage\nresponse diversity without sacrificing relevance.

As a result of the quantum Hall regime of magneto-optical graphene\nand the grating effect, three types of graphene surface plasmon polaritons\n(SPPs) modes are observed in the system: near-zero modes, high-frequency\nhyperbolic modes, and elliptic modes. The elliptic SPPs modes, which are caused\nby the combined effect of magnetic field and grating, are observed in the\ngraphene grating system for the first time.

In particular, the near-zero modes result in a unique enhancement\nregion of heat transfer, no matter for any twisted angle between gratings.

To address the challenge, rare and low-frequency variants are often\ngrouped into a gene or pathway level, and the effects of multiple variants\nevaluated based on collapsing methods. The sequential kernel association test\n(SKAT) is one of the most effective collapsing methods. SKAT utilizes the\nkernel matrix. The size of the kernel matrix is O(n^2), where the sample size\nis n, so that the calculation of the data using the kernel method requires a\nlong time. As the sample sizes of human genetic studies increase, the\ncomputational time is getting more and more problematic. In the present paper,\nthe genotype value decomposition method is proposed for the handling the\nsequential kernel in a short period of time. The method can be referred to as\ngenotype value decomposition. In the present paper, it is shown that the\ngenetic relationship matrix and Identity by State (IBS) matrix can be obtained\nusing the genotype value vectors. By using this method, the SKAT can be\nconducted with time complexity O(n). The proposed method enables to conduct\nSKAT for samples of human genetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 04:59:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 06:42:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 01:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-11"}

We give a\nsimple but rigorous treatment of the subject at the textbook level that\nexplains the apparent paradoxes that are much discussed in the literature on\nthe subject. We first derive the equation of motion of a charged particle from\nconservation of energy and momentum, which includes the self-force term. We\nthen show that this theory is unstable if charged particles are pointlike: the\nenergy is unbounded from below, and charged particles self-accelerate\n(`over-react') due to their negative `bare' mass. This theory clearly does not\ndescribe our world, but we show that these instabilities are absent if the\nparticle has a finite size larger than its classical radius. For such\nfinite-size charged particles, the effects of radiation reaction can be\ncomputed in a systematic expansion in the size of the particle. The leading\nterm in this expansion is the reduced-order Abraham-Lorentz equation of motion,\nwhich has no stability problems. We also discuss the apparent paradox that a\nparticle with constant acceleration radiates, but does not suffer radiation\nreaction (`under-reaction'). Along the way, we introduce the ideas of\nrenormalization and effective theories, which are important in many areas of\nmodern theoretical physics.

However, doing so exposes the\nclassifier to another kind of bias called infra-marginality. This refers to\nindividual-level bias where some individuals/subgroups can be worse off than\nunder simply optimizing for accuracy. For instance, a classifier implementing\nrace-based parity may significantly disadvantage women of the advantaged race.\nTo quantify this bias, we propose a general notion of $\\eta$-infra-marginality\nthat can be used to evaluate the extent of this bias. We prove theoretically\nthat, unlike other fairness metrics, infra-marginality does not have a\ntrade-off with accuracy: high accuracy directly leads to low infra-marginality.\nThis observation is confirmed through empirical analysis on multiple simulated\nand real-world datasets. Further, we find that maximizing group fairness often\nincreases infra-marginality, suggesting the consideration of both group-level\nfairness and individual-level infra-marginality. However, measuring\ninfra-marginality requires knowledge of the true distribution of\nindividual-level outcomes correctly and explicitly. We propose a practical\nmethod to measure infra-marginality, and a simple algorithm to maximize\ngroup-wise accuracy and avoid infra-marginality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 07:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

To\nminimise risk and increase resilience, communities need robust evacuation\nstrategies that account for people's likely behaviour both before and during a\nbushfire. Agent-based modelling (ABM) offers a practical way to simulate a\nrange of bushfire evacuation scenarios. However, the ABM should reflect the\ndiversity of possible human responses in a given community. The\nBelief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive model captures behaviour in a compact\nrepresentation that is understandable by domain experts. Within a BDI-ABM\nsimulation, individual BDI agents can be assigned profiles that determine their\nlikely behaviour. Over a population of agents their collective behaviour will\ncharacterise the community response. These profiles are drawn from existing\nhuman behaviour research and consultation with emergency services personnel and\ncapture the expected behaviours of identified groups in the population, both\nprior to and during an evacuation. A realistic representation of each community\ncan then be formed, and evacuation scenarios within the simulation can be used\nto explore the possible impact of population structure on outcomes. It is hoped\nthat this will give an improved understanding of the risks associated with\nevacuation, and lead to tailored evacuation plans for each community to help\nthem prepare for and respond to bushfire.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 08:07:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

In the former task, our results are comparable to\nstate-of-the-art; in the latter task our results significantly outperform\nearlier methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 09:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

However, in realistic scenarios,\naudio signals are adversely affected by reverberation, noise, interference, and\nperiods of speech inactivity. In dynamic scenarios, where the sources and\nmicrophone platforms may be moving, the signals are additionally affected by\nvariations in the source-sensor geometries. In practice, approaches to sound\nsource localization and tracking are often impeded by missing estimates of\nactive sources, estimation errors, as well as false estimates. The aim of the\nLOCAlization and TrAcking (LOCATA) Challenge is an open-access framework for\nthe objective evaluation and benchmarking of broad classes of algorithms for\nsound source localization and tracking. This article provides a review of\nrelevant localization and tracking algorithms and, within the context of the\nexisting literature, a detailed evaluation and dissemination of the LOCATA\nsubmissions. The evaluation highlights achievements in the field, open\nchallenges, and identifies potential future directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 09:02:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 14:29:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 08:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

We aim to establish a statistical view of\nclump fragmentation at sub-parsec scales based on a large sample of massive\nclumps selected from the ATLASGAL survey. We used the APEX/SABOCA camera at 350\n$\\mu$m to image clumps at a resolution of 8.$''$5. The majority of the sample\nconsists of massive clumps that are weak or in absorption at 24 $\\mu$m. We\nresolve rich filamentary structures and identify the population of compact\nsources. We use association with mid-infrared 22-24 $\\mu$m and 70 $\\mu$m point\nsources to pin down the star formation activity of the cores. We then\nstatistically assess their physical properties, and the fragmentation\ncharacteristics of massive clumps. We find a moderate correlation between the\nclump fragmentation levels with the clump gas density and the predicted number\nof fragments with pure Jeans fragmentation scenario; we find a strong\ncorrelation between the mass of the most massive fragment and the total clump\nmass, suggesting that the self-gravity may play an important role in the\nclumps' small scale structure formation. We identify 27 massive quiescent cores\nwith $M_{\\rm core}>100$ M$_{\\odot}$ within 5 kpc; these are massive enough to\nbe self-gravitating but do not yet show any sign of star-formation. This sample\ncomprises, therefore, promising candidates of massive pre-stellar cores, or\ndeeply embedded high-mass protostars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 09:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

However, the mechanisms underlying this correlation are only\npoorly understood. Here, we investigate how the loss of excitatory synapses in\nsparsely connected random networks of spiking excitatory and inhibitory neurons\nalters their dynamical characteristics. Beyond the effects on the network's\nactivity statistics, we find that the loss of excitatory synapses on excitatory\nneurons shifts the network dynamic towards the stable regime. The decrease in\nsensitivity to small perturbations to time varying input can be considered as\nan indication of a reduction of computational capacity. A full recovery of the\nnetwork performance can be achieved by firing rate homeostasis, here\nimplemented by an up-scaling of the remaining excitatory-excitatory synapses.\nBy analysing the stability of the linearized network dynamics, we explain how\nhomeostasis can simultaneously maintain the network's firing rate and\nsensitivity to small perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 09:18:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

MapSDI allows for\nthe semantic enrichment of large-sized, heterogeneous, and potentially\nlow-quality data efficiently. The input of MapSDI is a set of data sources and\nmapping rules being generated by a mapping language such as RML. First, MapSDI\npre-processes the sources based on semantic information extracted from mapping\nrules, by performing basic database operators; it projects out required\nattributes, eliminates duplicates, and selects relevant entries. All these\noperators are defined based on the knowledge encoded by the mapping rules which\nwill be then used by the semantification engine (or RDFizer) to produce a\nknowledge graph. We have empirically studied the impact of MapSDI on existing\nRDFizers, and observed that knowledge graph creation time can be reduced on\naverage in one order of magnitude.

Using Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) that\ncomprise customized radio functionalities, each virtualized RAN, denominated\nRAN slice, could meet its specific requirements.

Very good agreement was obtained for all three\ngiants with these data for the basic parameters Teff, logg, and M. Special\nattention was devoted to analysis of the Fe I lines which are the basis of a\nsimultaneous determination of the metallicity index [Fe/H] and microturbulent\nparameter Vt. The equivalent widths W of the Fe I lines are automatically\nmeasured from published spectra for the benchmark stars. An analysis of Fe I\nlines from the list of \"golden lines\" selected in a study of benchmark stars\nled to the conclusion that the excitation potential El of the low level of the\nlines plays an substantial role in determining [Fe/H] and Vt. It is shown that\nin the case of the early K-giants {\\beta} Gem and {\\mu} Leo for lines in the\nrange of W from 100 to 300 m{\\AA} there is a dependence of the [Fe/H] and Vt\nvalues on El.

End-to-End\nmethods are the current state-of-the-art for person search that solve both\ndetection and re-identification jointly.

To effectively minimize the distance\nbetween the created face and the real one, two loss functions, i.e. a\n\"discriminative loss\" and a \"facial content loss\", are specifically designed.\nAs the rendering process of a game engine is not differentiable, a generative\nnetwork is further introduced as an \"imitator\" to imitate the physical behavior\nof the game engine so that the proposed method can be implemented under a\nneural style transfer framework and the parameters can be optimized by gradient\ndescent. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a high\ndegree of generation similarity between the input face photo and the created\nin-game character in terms of both global appearance and local details. Our\nmethod has been deployed in a new game last year and has now been used by\nplayers over 1 million times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 11:05:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

However, current automated\nmethods for CRC grading typically utilise small image patches and therefore\nfail to incorporate the entire tissue micro-architecture for grading purposes.\nTo overcome the challenges of CRC grading, we present a novel cell-graph\nconvolutional neural network (CGC-Net) that converts each large histology image\ninto a graph, where each node is represented by a nucleus within the original\nimage and cellular interactions are denoted as edges between these nodes\naccording to node similarity.

The action for $N=2$ $AdS_{4}$ SUGRA is invariant under\n$SO(1,3)\\times U(1)$ gauge transformations, and under local SUSY. We present a\ngeometric action that involves two \"inhomogeneous\" parts: an orthosymplectic\n$OSp(4\\vert 2)$ gauge-invariant action of the Yang-Mills type, and a\nsupplementary action invariant under purely bosonic $SO(2,3)\\times U(1)\\sim\nSp(4)\\times SO(2)$ sector of $OSp(4\\vert 2)$, that needs to be added for\nconsistency. This action reduces to $N=2$ $AdS_{4}$ SUGRA after gauge fixing,\nfor which we use a constrained auxiliary field in the manner of Stelle and\nWest. Canonical deformation is performed by using the Seiberg-Witten approach\nto noncommutative (NC) gauge field theory with the Moyal product.

In this work, we investigate the\ntopological input of twisted flux tube emergence directly by studying helicity\nand winding fluxes. In magnetohydrodynamic simulations with domains spanning\nfrom the top of the convection zone to the lower corona, we simulate the\nemergence of twisted flux tubes with a range of different initial field\nstrengths. One important feature of this work is the inclusion of a\nconvectively-unstable layer beneath the photosphere. We find approximately\nself-similar behaviour in the helicity input for the different field strengths\nconsidered. As the tubes rise and reach the photosphere, there is a strong\ninput of negative helicity since we consider left-handed twisted tubes. This\nphase is then followed by a reduction of the negative input and, for low\ninitial field strengths, a net positive helicity input. This phase corresponds\nto the growing influence of convection on the field and the development of\nserpentine field structures during emergence. The winding flux can be used to\ndetect when the twisted cores of the tubes reach the photosphere, giving clear\ninformation about the input of topologically complex magnetic field into the\nsolar atmosphere. In short, the helicity and winding fluxes can provide much\ninformation about how a magnetic field emerges that is not directly available\nfrom other sources, such as magnetograms. In evaulating the helicity content of\nthese simualtions we test numerous means for creating synthetic magnetograms,\nincluding methods which acount for both the evolving geometry and the finite\nextent of the photosphere.

A new methodology is presented to analyze the\nthermodynamic stability of films, where the integral that describes the total\nenergy of the system is approximated by a quadrature rule. We show that, for\nlarge pores, the thermodynamic stability limit of adsorbed droplets and bubbles\nin both open and closed pores is governed by their mechanical stability, which\nis closely linked to the pore shape. This is also the case for a film in a\nclosed pore. In open pores, the film is chemically unstable except for very low\nfilm-phase contact angles and for a limited range in external pressure.

Methods: We modeled the MRI reconstruction problem with Bayes's\ntheorem, following the recently proposed PixelCNN++ method. The image\nreconstruction from incomplete k-space measurement was obtained by maximizing\nthe posterior possibility. A generative network was utilized as the image\nprior, which was computationally tractable, and the k-space data fidelity was\nenforced by using an equality constraint. The stochastic backpropagation was\nutilized to calculate the descent gradient in the process of maximum a\nposterior, and a projected subgradient method was used to impose the equality\nconstraint. In contrast to the other deep learning reconstruction methods, the\nproposed one used the likelihood of prior as the training loss and the\nobjective function in reconstruction to improve the image quality. Results: The\nproposed method showed an improved performance in preserving image details and\nreducing aliasing artifacts, compared with GRAPPA, $\\ell_1$-ESPRiT, and MODL, a\nstate-of-the-art deep learning reconstruction method. The proposed method\ngenerally achieved more than 5 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio improvement for\ncompressed sensing and parallel imaging reconstructions compared with the other\nmethods.

The whole setup, including\nsingle-pass second-harmonic generation in a waveguide, fits on a small\nbreadboard and produces 9.3 dB of squeezing at a 5 MHz sideband-frequency. The\nsetup is currently limited by phase noise, but further optimization and\ndevelopment should allow for a 19\" sized turn-key squeezing source capable of\ndelivering more than 10 dB of squeezing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 13:21:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

We use novel approximations which greatly\nsimplify the mathematical treatment and allow us to calculate the conductance\nin terms of a handful macroscopic parameters instead of the myriads of\nmicroscopic parameters describing the details of an atomic level quantum\nchemical computation. The new approach makes it possible to get predictions for\nthe outcomes of new experiments without relying solely on high performance\ncomputing and can distinguish important and unimportant details of the protein\nstructures from the point of view of transport properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 14:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

It is based on the multidimensional model,\nwhere data can be seen as a cube such that each cell contains one or more\nmeasures that can be aggregated along dimensions. In a Big Data scenario,\ntraditional data warehousing and OLAP operations are clearly not sufficient to\naddress current data analysis requirements, for example, social network\nanalysis. Furthermore, OLAP operations and models can expand the possibilities\nof graph analysis beyond the traditional graph-based computation. Nevertheless,\nthere is not much work on the problem of taking OLAP analysis to the graph data\nmodel. This paper proposes a formal multidimensional model for graph analysis,\nthat considers the basic graph data, and also background information in the\nform of dimension hierarchies. The graphs in this model are node- and\nedge-labelled directed multi-hypergraphs, called graphoids, which can be\ndefined at several different levels of granularity using the dimensions\nassociated with them. Operations analogous to the ones used in typical OLAP\nover cubes are defined over graphoids. The paper presents a formal definition\nof the graphoid model for OLAP, proves that the typical OLAP operations on\ncubes can be expressed over the graphoid model, and shows that the classic data\ncube model is a particular case of the graphoid data model. Finally, a case\nstudy supports the claim that, for many kinds of OLAP-like analysis on graphs,\nthe graphoid model works better than the typical relational OLAP alternative,\nand for the classic OLAP queries, it remains competitive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 14:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

It was recently argued that black hole area\nquantization could be a mechanism to produce so-called echoes as well as\ncharacteristic absorption lines in gravitational wave observations of merging\nblack holes. One can match the spontaneous decay of these quantum black holes\nto Hawking radiation calculations. Using some assumptions, one can then\nestimate the natural widths of these states. As can be seen from a classical\npaper by Bekenstein and Mukhanov, the ratio between width and spacing of\nnonspinning black hole states approaches a small constant, which seems to\nconfirm the claim. However, we find that, including the effect of black hole\nspin, the natural widths increase. To properly address any claim about\nastrophysical black holes, one should examine the spinning case, as real black\nholes spin. Thus, the word spinning is key to the question of whether or not\nblack holes should have an observable spectrum in nature. Our results suggest\nthat it should be possible to distinguish between any scenarios for which the\nanswer to this question is yes. However, for all of the commonly discussed\nscenarios, our answer is almost certainly no.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 15:31:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 14:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

This technique augments a given\noptimization problem (e.g. deriving from an ERM problem) with a random linear\nterm, and then exactly solves it. However, to date, analyses of this approach\ncrucially rely on the convexity and smoothness of the objective function,\nlimiting its generality. We give two algorithms that extend this approach\nsubstantially. The first algorithm requires nothing except boundedness of the\nloss function, and operates over a discrete domain. Its privacy and accuracy\nguarantees hold even without assuming convexity. This gives an oracle-efficient\noptimization algorithm over arbitrary discrete domains that is comparable in\nits generality to the exponential mechanism. The second algorithm operates over\na continuous domain and requires only that the loss function be bounded and\nLipschitz in its continuous parameter. Its privacy analysis does not require\nconvexity. Its accuracy analysis does require convexity, but does not require\nsecond order conditions like smoothness. Even without convexity, this algorithm\ncan be generically used as an oracle-efficient optimization algorithm, with\naccuracy evaluated empirically. We complement our theoretical results with an\nempirical evaluation of the non-convex case, in which we use an integer program\nsolver as our optimization oracle.

This matrix can be applied to tensors $x^{(1)}\\otimes\\dots\\otimes\nx^{(c)}\\in R^{d^c}$ in $O(c\\, m \\min\\{d,m\\})$ time -- hence the name \"Tensor\nSketch\". (Here $x\\otimes y = \\text{asvec}(xy^T) = [x_1y_1,\nx_1y_2,\\dots,x_1y_m,x_2y_1,\\dots,x_ny_m]\\in R^{nm}$.)\n  This improves upon earlier Tensor Sketch constructions by Pagh and Pham~[TOCT\n2013, SIGKDD 2013] and Avron et al.~[NIPS 2014] which require\n$m=\\Omega(3^c\\lambda^2\\delta^{-1})$ rows for the same guarantees. The factors\nof $\\lambda$, $\\varepsilon^{-2}$ and $\\log1/\\delta$ can all be shown to be\nnecessary making our sketch optimal up to log factors.\n  With another construction we get $\\lambda$ times more rows $m=\\tilde\nO(c\\,\\lambda^2\\,\\varepsilon^{-2}(\\log1/\\delta)^3)$, but the matrix can be\napplied to any vector $x^{(1)}\\otimes\\dots\\otimes x^{(c)}\\in R^{d^c}$ in just\n$\\tilde O(c\\, (d+m))$ time. This matches the application time of Tensor Sketch\nwhile still improving the exponential dependencies in $c$ and $\\log1/\\delta$.\n  Technically, we show two main lemmas: (1) For many Johnson Lindenstrauss (JL)\nconstructions, if $Q,Q'\\in R^{m\\times d}$ are independent JL matrices, the\nelement-wise product $Qx \\circ Q'y$ equals $M(x\\otimes y)$ for some $M\\in\nR^{m\\times d^2}$ which is itself a JL matrix. (2) If $M^{(i)}\\in R^{m\\times\nmd}$ are independent JL matrices, then $M^{(1)}(x \\otimes (M^{(2)}y \\otimes\n\\dots)) = M(x\\otimes y\\otimes \\dots)$ for some $M\\in R^{m\\times d^c}$ which is\nitself a JL matrix. Combining these two results give an efficient sketch for\ntensors of any size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 08:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-05"}

Exploiting a separation of timescales in the model, we use the method of\nmatched asymptotics to derive a new two-dimensional, long-timescale,\napproximation of the full model, which differs from the quasi-steady-state\napproximation introduced by Kuznetsov et al. (1994), but is validated against\nnumerical solutions of the full model. Through a phase-plane analysis, we show\nthat our reduced model is excitable, a feature not traditionally associated\nwith tumour-immune dynamics. Through a systematic parameter sensitivity\nanalysis, we demonstrate that excitability generates complex bifurcating\ndynamics in the model. These are consistent with a variety of clinically\nobserved phenomena, and suggest that excitability may underpin tumour-immune\ninteractions. The model exhibits the three stages of immunoediting -\nelimination, equilibrium, and escape, via stable steady states with different\ntumour cell concentrations. Such heterogeneity in tumour cell numbers can stem\nfrom variability in initial conditions and/or model parameters that control the\nproperties of the immune system and its response to the tumour. We identify\ndifferent biophysical parameter targets that could be manipulated with\nimmunotherapy in order to control tumour size, and we find that preferred\nstrategies may differ between patients depending on the strength of their\nimmune systems, as determined by patient-specific values of associated model\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 10:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-12"}
