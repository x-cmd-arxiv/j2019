To prove the concept\nof our proposed method, we demonstrate the detection of a 10-GHz subcarrier\nmodulated (SCM) signal using 500-MHz bandwidth ADCs by optically converting the\nSCM signal to ten 1-GHz bandwidth signals that can be processed in parallel for\nfull signal detection and reconstruction. Using sinusoidal wave based standard\nADC testing, we demonstrate a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of >45dB and\nsignal-to-noise-and-distortion (SINAD) of >20dB, only limited by the receiver\nfront-end design.

We associate a universal integrand to each Feynman diagram\ncontributing to the wavefunction of the universe. For certain (light) masses,\nsuch an integrand satisfies recursion relations involving differential\noperators, connecting states with different masses and having, as a seed, the\nmassless scalar (which describes a conformally coupled scalar as a special\ncase). We show that it is a degenerate limit of the canonical form of a\ngeneralisation of the cosmological polytopes describing the wavefunction for\nmassless scalars. Intriguingly, the flat-space scattering amplitude appears as\na higher codimension face: it is encoding the leading term in the Laurent\nexpansion as the total energy is taken to zero, with the codimension of the\nface providing the order of the total energy pole. The same connection between\nthe other faces and the Laurent expansion coefficients holds for the other\nsingularities of the wavefunction of the universe, all of them connectable to\nflat-space processes. As the degenerate limit is taken, some of the\nsingularities of the canonical form of the polytope collapse onto each other\ngenerating higher order poles. Finally, we consider the mass as a perturbative\ncoupling, showing that the contribution to the wavefunction coming from graphs\nwith mass two-point couplings can be identified with a degenerate limit of the\ncanonical form of the cosmological polytope, if the perturbative expansion is\ndone around the conformally coupled state; or as double degenerate limit of the\ncanonical form of the extension of the cosmological polytopes introduced in the\npresent paper, if the perturbative expansion is done around minimally coupled\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 16:40:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-06"}

The conditions required for the\nCMs of magnetic early B-type stars to yield detectable emission in H$\\alpha$ --\nthe principal diagnostic of these structures -- are poorly constrained. A key\nreason is that no detailed study of the magnetic and rotational evolution of\nthis population has yet been performed. Using newly determined rotational\nperiods, modern magnetic measurements, and atmospheric parameters determined\nvia spectroscopic modelling, we have derived fundamental parameters, dipolar\noblique rotator models, and magnetospheric parameters for 56 early B-type\nstars. Comparison to magnetic A- and O-type stars shows that the range of\nsurface magnetic field strength is essentially constant with stellar mass, but\nthat the unsigned surface magnetic flux increases with mass. Both the surface\nmagnetic dipole strength and the total magnetic flux decrease with stellar age,\nwith the rate of flux decay apparently increasing with stellar mass. We find\ntentative evidence that multipolar magnetic fields may decay more rapidly than\ndipoles. Rotational periods increase with stellar age, as expected for a\nmagnetic braking scenario. Without exception, all stars with H$\\alpha$ emission\noriginating in a CM are 1) rapid rotators, 2) strongly magnetic, and 3) young,\nwith the latter property consistent with the observation that magnetic fields\nand rotation both decrease over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 17:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Risk which locomoting robots face in physical spaces was not\nformally defined in the robotics literature. Safety or risk concerns were\naddressed in an ad hoc fashion, depending only on the specific application of\ninterest. Without a formal definition, certain properties of risk were simply\nassumed but ill-supported, such as additivity or being Markovian. The only\ncontributing adverse effect being considered is related with obstacles. This\nwork proposes a formal definition of robot motion risk using propositional\nlogic and probability theory. It presents a universe of risk elements within\nthree major risk categories and unifies them into one single metric. True\nproperties of risk are revealed with formal reasoning, such as non-additivity\nor history-dependency. Risk representation which encompasses risk effects from\nboth temporal and spatial domain is presented. The resulted risk framework\nprovides a formal approach to reason about robot motion risk. Safety of robot\nlocomotion could be explicitly reasoned, quantified, and compared. It could be\nused for risk-aware planning and reasoning by both human and robotic agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 17:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-06"}

In a\nprevious paper [C. del Junco and S. Vaikuntanathan, Phys. Rev.

Here, we extend our work to Markov state\nmodels consisting of a large cycle decorated with multiple small cycles. These\nadditional cycles are intended to represent alternate pathways that the\noscillator may take as it fluctuates about its average path. Combining a\nmapping to single-cycle networks based on first passage time distributions with\nour previously developed theory, we are able to make analytical predictions for\nthe period and coherence of oscillations in these networks. One implication of\nour predictions is that a high energy budget can make different network\ntopologies and arrangements of rates degenerate as far as the period and\ncoherence of oscillations is concerned. Excellent agreement between analytical\nand numerical results confirms that this is the case. Our results suggest that\nbiochemical oscillators can be more robust to fluctuations in the path of the\noscillator when they have a high energy budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 17:16:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 15:17:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-06"}

Our main result is that the\ntime of existence can be controlled in terms of the\n$H^{2^+}(\\mathbb{R}^3)$-norm of the wave-part of the initial data and various\nSobolev and H\\\"{o}lder norms of the transport-part of the initial data, the\nlatter comprising the initial vorticity and entropy. The wave-part regularity\nassumptions are optimal in the scale of Sobolev spaces: shocks can instantly\nform if one only assumes a bound for the $H^2(\\mathbb{R}^3)$-norm of the\nwave-part of the initial data. Our proof relies on the assumption that the\ntransport-part of the initial data is more regular than the wave-part, and we\nshow that the additional regularity is propagated by the flow, even though the\ntransport-part of the flow is deeply coupled to the rougher wave-part.

These halos possess internal spin, `lambda', which is\ninsignificant rotationally but does affect interactions between the baryonic\nand DM components. While statistics of prograde and retrograde spinning halos\nin galaxies is not available at present, the existence of such halos is\nimportant for galaxy evolution. In the previous works, we analyzed dynamical\nand secular evolution of stellar bars in prograde spinning halos and the DM\nresponse to the bar perturbation, and found that it is modified by the resonant\ninteractions between the bar and the DM halo orbits. In the present work, we\nfollow the evolution of stellar bars in retrograde halos. We find, that this\nevolution differs substantially from evolution in rigid unresponsive halos,\ndiscussed in the literature. First, we confirm that the bar instability is\ndelayed progressively along the retrograde `lambda' sequence. Second, the bar\nevolution in the retrograde halos differs also from that in the prograde halos,\nin that the bars continue to grow substantially over the simulation time of 10\nGyr. The DM response is also substantially weaker compared to this response in\nthe prograde halos. Third, using orbital spectral analysis of the DM orbital\nstructure, we find a phenomenon we call the orbit reversal --- when retrograde\nDM orbits interact with the stellar bar, reverse their streaming and\nprecession, and become prograde. This process dominates the inner halo region\nadjacent to the bar and allows these orbits to be trapped by the bar, thus\nincreasing efficiency of angular momentum transfer by the Inner Lindblad\nResonance. We demonstrate this reversal process explicitly in a number of\nexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

In relation to the ISM diagnostic, by studying the CO\nexcitation, the density of the neutral gas, and the strength of the ultraviolet\nradiation field, compact SFGs resemble galaxies located in the upper envelope\nof the SFGs main sequence, although yet based on a small sample size.

These\ndata encompass all the embedded protostars in the cloud and several Flat and\nClass II objects to produce the largest, homogeneous study of dust polarization\non disk scales to date. The goal of this study is to study dust polarization\ndown to disk scales. We find that 14/37 (38%) of the YSOs are detected in\npolarization. Nine of these sources have uniform polarization angles and four\nsources have azimuthal polarization. The sources with uniform polarization tend\nto have steeper inclinations (> 60 degree) than those with azimuthal\npolarization (< 60 degree). The majority (9/14) of the detected sources have\npolarization morphologies and disk properties consistent with dust\nself-scattering in optically thick disks. The remaining sources may be instead\ntracing magnetic fields. Their inferred field directions from rotating the\npolarization vectors by 90 degree are mainly poloidal or hourglass shaped. We\nfind no evidence of a strong toroidal field component toward any of our disks.\nFor the 23 YSOs that are undetected in polarization, roughly half of them have\n3-sigma upper limits of < 2%. These sources also tend to have inclinations < 60\ndegree and they are generally compact. Since lower inclination sources tend to\nhave azimuthal polarization, these YSOs may be undetected in polarization due\nto unresolved polarization structure within our beam. We propose that disks\nwith inclinations > 60 degree are the best candidates for future polarization\nstudies of dust self-scattering as these systems will generally show uniform\npolarization vectors that do not require very high resolution to resolve.

A\nnetwork with $d$ inputs per neuron is found to be equivalent to an additive\nmodel of order $d$, whereas with a degree distribution the network combines\nadditive terms of different orders.

Frequently, such diverse diagnostics can only be obtained from\ntelescopes and/or instrumentation operating at widely different spatial\nresolution. To optimize the utilization of such data, we propose a new method\nfor the global inversion of data acquired at different spatial resolution. The\nmethod has its roots in the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm but involves the use\nof linear operators to transform and degrade the synthetic spectra of a highly\nresolved guess model to account for the the effects of spatial resolution, data\nsampling, alignment and image rotation of each of the data sets. We have\ncarried out a list of numerical experiments to show that our method allows\nextracting spatial information from two simulated datasets that have gone\nthrough two different telescope apertures and that are sampled in different\nspatial grids. Our results show that each dataset contributes in the inversion\nby constraining information at the spatial scales that are present in each of\nthe datasets, without any negative effects derived from the combination of\nmultiple resolution data. This method is especially relevant for chromospheric\nstudies that attempt at combining datasets acquired with different telescopes\nand/or datasets acquired at different wavelengths, both limiting factors in the\nresolution of solar instrumentation. The techniques described in the present\nstudy will also help addressing the ever increasing resolution gap between\nspace-borne missions and forthcoming ground-based facilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 19:12:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

We consider random\nsampling for answering the ubiquitous class of group-by queries, which first\ngroup data according to one or more attributes, and then aggregate within each\ngroup after filtering through a predicate. The challenge with group-by queries\nis that a sampling method cannot focus on optimizing the quality of a single\nanswer (e.g. the mean of selected data), but must simultaneously optimize the\nquality of a set of answers (one per group).\n  We present CVOPT, a query- and data-driven sampling framework for a set of\ngroup-by queries. To evaluate the quality of a sample, CVOPT defines a metric\nbased on the norm (e.g. $\\ell_2$ or $\\ell_\\infty$) of the coefficients of\nvariation (CVs) of different answers, and constructs a stratified sample that\nprovably optimizes the metric. CVOPT can handle group-by queries on data where\ngroups have vastly different statistical characteristics, such as frequencies,\nmeans, or variances. CVOPT jointly optimizes for multiple aggregations and\nmultiple group-by clauses, and provides a way to prioritize specific groups or\naggregates. It can be tuned to cases when partial information about a query\nworkload is known, such as a data warehouse where queries are scheduled to run\nperiodically.\n  Our experimental results show that CVOPT outperforms current state-of-the-art\non sample quality and estimation accuracy for group-by queries.

This performance is very\nclose to the baseline performance of training and testing on T2-weighted scans\n(0.92). Furthermore, we applied our network to an independent test set made up\nof publicly available scans acquired using a T1-weighted TWIST sequence and a\ndifferent coil configuration. On this dataset we obtained a performance of\n0.89, close to the inter-observer variability of the ground truth segmentations\n(0.92). Our results show that using intensity augmentation in addition to\ngeometric augmentation is a suitable method to overcome the intensity domain\nshift and we expect it to be useful for a wide range of segmentation tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 21:40:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-09"}

The degree of nanoscale structural alterations of\ntumorigenic cells and anti-cancerous drug treated tumorigenic cells are\nquantified by using the recently developed inverse participation ratio (IPR)\ntechnique. Results show an increase in the degree of nanoscale fluctuations in\ntumorigenic cells relative to non-tumorigenic cells; then a nearly reverse of\nthe degree of fluctuation of tumorigenic cells to that of non-tumorigenic\ncells, after the anti-cancerous drugs treatment. These results support that the\neffect of anti-cancerous drugs in cancer treatment can be quantified by using\nthe degree of nanoscale fluctuations of the cells via TEM imaging. Potential\napplications of the technique for cancer treatment are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 22:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-09"}

We first consider the binary\nhypothesis case where there is only one post-change hypothesis and prove a\nnovel converse to the first-order asymptotic detection delay in the large mean\ntime to a false alarm regime. This converse is tight in that it coincides with\nthe currently best achievability shown by Fellouris et al.; hence, the optimal\nasymptotic performance of binary BDQCD is characterized. An important\nimplication of this result is that, even with compromised sensors, a 1-bit link\nbetween each sensor and the fusion center suffices to achieve asymptotic\noptimality. To accommodate multiple post-change hypotheses, we then formulate\nthe multi-hypothesis BDQCD problem and again investigate the optimal\nfirst-order performance under different bandwidth constraints. A converse is\nfirst obtained by extending our converse from binary to multi-hypothesis BDQCD.\nTwo families of stopping rules, namely the simultaneous $d$-th alarm and the\nmulti-shot $d$-th alarm, are then proposed. Under sufficient link bandwidth,\nthe simultaneous $d$-th alarm, with $d$ being set to the number of honest\nsensors, can achieve the asymptotic performance that coincides with the derived\nconverse bound; hence, the asymptotically optimal performance of\nmulti-hypothesis BDQCD is again characterized. Moreover, although being shown\nto be asymptotically optimal only for some special cases, the multi-shot $d$-th\nalarm is much more bandwidth-efficient and energy-efficient than the\nsimultaneous $d$-th alarm. Built upon the above success in characterizing the\nasymptotic optimality of the BDQCD, a corresponding leader-follower Stackelberg\ngame is formulated and its solution is found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 01:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-09"}

A bubble is a highly nonlinear oscillator that exists in\nvarious phenomena and applications ranging from material science and underwater\nacoustics to medical ultrasound. The occurrence of period doubling (PD) in the\noscillations of the bubbles is concomitant with the generation of 1/2 order\nsubharmonics (SHs). SH oscillations are used to monitor the bubble activity and\nare employed as a measure of stable cavitation. As bubbles are intravascular\ncontrast agents, SH oscillations are used in diagnostic ultrasound to increase\nthe contrast of the blood vessels to the tissue. Despite the importance of PD\nin a bubble oscillator, the dynamical behavior of the bubble during stable SH\nand ultra-harmonic (UH) oscillations have not thoroughly studied yet. In this\nwork, through applying a comprehensive bifurcation method, we study the\nnonlinear radial oscillations of the bubble oscillator as a function of\nultrasound driving pressure. The frequency of the driving force is chosen as\nthe linear resonance frequency (fr) and linear SH resonance frequency (fsh=2fr)\nof the bubble. Results show that, when the bubble is sonicated with 2fr, PD\ndoubling occurrence is more likely to result in non-destructive oscillations.\nThe evolution of the bubble stable P2 dynamics forms the shape of a bow-tie for\nbubbles with an initial diameter of 740nm and above. When f=2fr, the phase\nportrait of the P2 attractor is distinctly different from a P2 attractor when\nf=fr, and SH component of the backscattered pressure is maximum. When sonicated\nby 2fr, due to lower oscillation amplitude and gentler bubble collapse, the\nbubble can sustain stable P2 oscillations for a longer duration and over a\nbroader range of applied acoustic pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 02:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-09"}

Specifically, we first build up connections between image\nregions and perform reasoning with Graph Convolutional Networks to generate\nfeatures with semantic relationships. Then, we propose to use the gate and\nmemory mechanism to perform global semantic reasoning on these\nrelationship-enhanced features, select the discriminative information and\ngradually generate the representation for the whole scene.

Several endogenous and exogenous variables can influence the\ndynamics of demand, and hence a single statistical model that only consists of\nhistorical sales data is often insufficient to produce accurate forecasts. In\npractice, the forecasts generated by baseline statistical models are often\njudgmentally adjusted by forecasters to incorporate factors and information\nthat are not incorporated in the baseline models. There are however systematic\nevents whose effect can be effectively quantified and modeled to help minimize\nhuman intervention in adjusting the baseline forecasts. In this paper, we\ndevelop and test a novel regime-switching approach to quantify systematic\ninformation/events and objectively incorporate them into the baseline\nstatistical model. Our simple yet practical and effective model can help limit\nforecast adjustments to only focus on the impact of less systematic events such\nas sudden climate change or dynamic market activities.

Roughly, PCNs are networks\nwhere each node represents a user and each directed, weighted edge represents\nfunds escrowed on a blockchain; these funds can be transacted only between the\nendpoints of the edge. Users efficiently transmit funds from node A to B by\nrelaying them over a path connecting A to B, as long as each edge in the path\ncontains enough balance (escrowed funds) to support the transaction. Whenever a\ntransaction succeeds, the edge weights are updated accordingly. However, in\ndeployed PCNs, channel balances (i.e., edge weights) are not revealed to users\nfor privacy reasons; users know only the initial weights at time 0. Hence, when\nrouting transactions, users first guess a path, then check if it supports the\ntransaction. This guess-and-check process dramatically reduces the success rate\nof transactions. At the other extreme, knowing full channel balances can give\nsubstantial improvements in success rate at the expense of privacy. In this\nwork, we study whether a network can reveal noisy channel balances to trade off\nprivacy for utility. We show fundamental limits on such a tradeoff, and propose\nnoise mechanisms that achieve the fundamental limit for a general class of\ngraph topologies. Our results suggest that in practice, PCNs should operate\neither in the low-privacy or low-utility regime; it is not possible to get\nlarge gains in utility by giving up a little privacy, or large gains in privacy\nby sacrificing a little utility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 05:18:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 May 2020 17:18:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 02:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

When only\nweak supervision is provided, it is usually necessary to search valid logical\nforms for model training. However, a complex question typically involves a huge\nsearch space, which creates two main problems: 1) the solutions limited by\ncomputation time and memory usually reduce the success rate of the search, and\n2) spurious logical forms in the search results degrade the quality of training\ndata. These two problems lead to a poorly-trained semantic parsing model. In\nthis work, we propose an effective search method for weakly supervised KBQA\nbased on operator prediction for questions. With search space constrained by\npredicted operators, sufficient search paths can be explored, more valid\nlogical forms can be derived, and operators possibly causing spurious logical\nforms can be avoided. As a result, a larger proportion of questions in a weakly\nsupervised training set are equipped with logical forms, and fewer spurious\nlogical forms are generated. Such high-quality training data directly\ncontributes to a better semantic parsing model. Experimental results on one of\nthe largest KBQA datasets (i.e., CSQA) verify the effectiveness of our\napproach: improving the precision from 67% to 72% and the recall from 67% to\n72% in terms of the overall score.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 08:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-09"}

Regardless of\nthe programming method (e.g., by demonstration or traditional programming),\nrobot task programs are challenging to write, because they rely on multiple\nactions to succeed, including human-robot interactions. Unfortunately,\ninteractions are prone to fail, because a human may perform the wrong action\n(e.g., if the robot's request is not clear). Moreover, when the robot cannot\ndirectly observe the human action, it may not detect the failure until several\nsteps after it occurs. Therefore, writing fault-tolerant robot tasks is beyond\nthe ability of non-experts.\n  This paper presents a principled approach to detect and recover from a broad\nclass of failures that occur in end-user programs on service mobile robots. We\npresent a two-tiered Robot Task Programming Language (RTPL): 1) an expert\nroboticist uses a specification language to write a probabilistic model of the\nrobot's actions and interactions, and 2) a non-expert then writes an ordinary\nsequential program for a particular task. The RTPL runtime system executes the\ntask program sequentially, while using the probabilistic model to build a\nBayesian network that tracks possible, unobserved failures. If an error is\nobserved, RTPL uses Bayesian inference to find the likely root cause of the\nerror, and then attempts to re-execute a portion of the program for recovery.\n  Our empirical results show that RTPL 1) allows complex tasks to be written\nconcisely, 2) correctly identifies the root cause of failure, and 3) allows\nmultiple tasks to recover from a variety of errors, without task-specific\nerror-recovery code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 09:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-09"}

We first show how the set of MUSs can change in\na sliding window over $T$, and present an $O(n\\log\\sigma)$-time and\n$O(d)$-space algorithm to compute MUSs in a sliding window of width $d$ over\n$T$, where $\\sigma$ is the maximum number of distinct characters in every\nwindow. We then give tight upper and lower bounds on the maximum number of\nchanges in the set of MAWs in a sliding window over $T$. Our bounds improve on\nthe previous results in [Crochemore et al., 2017].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 10:17:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 06:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-16"}

One is scene\ntext detection which recognizes the runners by detecting a unique 'bib number'\nattached to their clothes and the other is person re-identification which\ndetects the runners based on their appearance.

As not all frames may\ncharacterize the underlying action---many are common across multiple\nactions---pooling schemes that impose equal importance on all frames might be\nunfavorable. In an attempt to tackle this problem, we propose discriminative\npooling, based on the notion that among the deep features generated on all\nshort clips, there is at least one that characterizes the action. To identify\nthese useful features, we resort to a negative bag consisting of features that\nare known to be irrelevant, for example, they are sampled either from datasets\nthat are unrelated to our actions of interest or are CNN features produced via\nrandom noise as input. With the features from the video as a positive bag and\nthe irrelevant features as the negative bag, we cast an objective to learn a\n(nonlinear) hyperplane that separates the unknown useful features from the rest\nin a multiple instance learning formulation within a support vector machine\nsetup. We use the parameters of this separating hyperplane as a descriptor for\nthe full video segment. Since these parameters are directly related to the\nsupport vectors in a max-margin framework, they can be treated as a weighted\naverage pooling of the features from the bags, with zero weights given to\nnon-support vectors. Our pooling scheme is end-to-end trainable within a deep\nlearning framework.

In this paper, we develop a statistical\ntheory of graph complexity in a general model of random graphs, the so-called\ngraphon model.\n  Given a graphon, we endow the latent space of the nodes with the neighborhood\ndistance that measures the propensity of two nodes to be connected with similar\nnodes. Our complexity index is then based on the covering number and the\nMinkowski dimension of (a purified version of) this metric space. Although the\nlatent space is not identifiable, these indices turn out to be identifiable.\nThis notion of complexity has simple interpretations on popular examples of\nrandom graphs: it matches the number of communities in stochastic block models;\nthe dimension of the Euclidean space in random geometric graphs; the regularity\nof the link function in H\\\"older graphon models.\n  From a single observation of the graph, we construct an estimator of the\nneighborhood-distance and show universal non-asymptotic bounds for its risk,\nmatching minimax lower bounds. Based on this estimated distance, we compute the\ncorresponding covering number and Minkowski dimension and we provide optimal\nnon-asymptotic error bounds for these two plug-in estimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 13:35:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 00:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

In particular, such observations on the\nlarge-scale anisotropy of TeV cosmic rays show that the dipole direction\ndiffers from the prediction of the conventional model. One possible reason is\nthat the large-scale regular magnetic field, which leads to an anisotropic\ndiffusion of cosmic rays, has not been included in the model provided by the\npublic numerical packages.

However, oceans\nare dynamic habitats---and some oceans may be better hosts for life than\nothers. In Earth's ocean, circulation transports essential nutrients such as\nphosphate and is a first-order control on the distribution and productivity of\nlife. Of particular importance is upward flow from the dark depths of the ocean\nin response to wind-driven divergence in surface layers. This `upwelling'\nreturns essential nutrients that tend to accumulate at depth via sinking of\norganic particulates back to the sunlit regions where photosynthetic life\nthrives. Ocean dynamics are likely to impose constraints on the activity and\natmospheric expression of photosynthetic life in exo-oceans as well, but we\nlack an understanding of how ocean dynamics may differ on other planets. We\naddress this issue by exploring the sensitivity of ocean dynamics to a suite of\nplanetary parameters using ROCKE-3D, a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM. Our\nresults suggest that planets that rotate slower and have higher surface\npressure than Earth may be the most attractive targets for remote life\ndetection because upwelling is enhanced under these conditions, resulting in\ngreater nutrient supply to the surface biosphere. Seasonal deepening of the\nmixed layer on high obliquity planets may also enhance nutrient replenishment\nfrom depth into the surface mixed layer. Efficient nutrient recycling favors\ngreater biological activity, more biosignature production, and thus more\ndetectable life.

There are two competing models for the central engines of GRBs; a\nblack hole or a newly formed milli-second magnetar. If the central engine is a\nmagnetar it is predicted to produce coherent radio emission as persistent or\nflaring activity. In this paper, we present the deepest limits to date for this\nemission following LOFAR rapid response observations of GRB 180706A.

Despite the recent success, each method agonizes over its\nintrinsic constraint. The online-only approaches suffer from a lack of\ngeneralization of the model they learn thus are inferior in target regression,\nwhile the offline-only approaches (e.g., convolutional siamese trackers) lack\nthe target-specific context information thus are not discriminative enough to\nhandle distractors, and robust enough to deformation. Therefore, we propose an\nonline module with an attention mechanism for offline siamese networks to\nextract target-specific features under L2 error. We further propose a filter\nupdate strategy adaptive to treacherous background noises for discriminative\nlearning, and a template update strategy to handle large target deformations\nfor robust learning. Effectiveness can be validated in the consistent\nimprovement over three siamese baselines: SiamFC, SiamRPN++, and SiamMask.\nBeyond that, our model based on SiamRPN++ obtains the best results over six\npopular tracking benchmarks and can operate beyond real-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 15:06:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 14:31:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-22"}

We argue that, in MOMAS,\nsuch compromises should be analysed on the basis of the utility that these\ncompromises have for the users of a system. As is standard in multi-objective\noptimisation, we model the user utility using utility functions that map value\nor return vectors to scalar values. This approach naturally leads to two\ndifferent optimisation criteria: expected scalarised returns (ESR) and\nscalarised expected returns (SER). We develop a new taxonomy which classifies\nmulti-objective multi-agent decision making settings, on the basis of the\nreward structures, and which and how utility functions are applied. This allows\nus to offer a structured view of the field, to clearly delineate the current\nstate-of-the-art in multi-objective multi-agent decision making approaches and\nto identify promising directions for future research. Starting from the\nexecution phase, in which the selected policies are applied and the utility for\nthe users is attained, we analyse which solution concepts apply to the\ndifferent settings in our taxonomy. Furthermore, we define and discuss these\nsolution concepts under both ESR and SER optimisation criteria. We conclude\nwith a summary of our main findings and a discussion of many promising future\nresearch directions in multi-objective multi-agent systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 15:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

However, these alterations must be minimal so as to\npreserve the users' objective in the experiment.

However, the prediction may be inaccurate,\nwhich limits the performance of transferring fine-grained expression. Instead\nof using an intermediate estimated guidance, we propose to explicitly transfer\nfacial expression by directly mapping two unpaired input images to two\nsynthesized images with swapped expressions. Specifically, considering AUs\nsemantically describe fine-grained expression details, we propose a novel\nmulti-class adversarial training method to disentangle input images into two\ntypes of fine-grained representations: AU-related feature and AU-free feature.\nThen, we can synthesize new images with preserved identities and swapped\nexpressions by combining AU-free features with swapped AU-related features.\nMoreover, to obtain reliable expression transfer results of the unpaired input,\nwe introduce a swap consistency loss to make the synthesized images and\nself-reconstructed images indistinguishable.

It is crucial to estimate if this\nconclusion remain true for other stars with current correction methods. We\nbuilt realistic time series in RV and chromospheric emission for old\nmain-sequence F6-K4 stars. The stellar parameters are spectral type, activity\nlevel, rotation period, cycle period and amplitude, latitude coverage, and spot\nconstrast, which we chose to be in ranges that are compatible with our current\nknowledge. This very large set of synthetic time series allowed us to study the\neffect of the parameters on the RV jitter and how the different contributions\nto the RV are affected in this first analysis of the data set. The RV jitter\nwas used to provide a first-order detection limit for each time series and\ndifferent temporal samplings. We find that the coverage in latitude of the\nactivity pattern and the cycle amplitudes have a strong effect on the RV\njitter, as has stellar inclination. RV jitter trends with B-V and LogR'HK are\nsimilar to observations, but activity cannot be responsible for RV jitter\nlarger than 2-3 m/s for very quiet stars: this observed jitter is therefore\nlikely to be due to other causes. We show that based on the RV jitter that is\nassociated with each time series and using a simple criterion, a planet with\none Earth mass and a period of one to two years probably cannot be detected\nwith current analysis techniques, except for the lower mass stars in our\nsample, but many observations would be required. The effect of inclination is\ncritical. The results are very important in the context of future RV follow-ups\nof transit detections of such planets. A significant improvement of analysis\ntechniques and/or observing strategies must be made to reach such low detection\nlimits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 15:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-09"}

Our particular focus is on detecting the respiratory\neffort-related arousals (RERAs) which are very subtle respiratory events that\ndo not meet the criteria for apnea or hypopnea, and are more challenging to\ndetect. Methods: The proposed algorithm is based on a bidirectional long\nshort-term memory (BiLSTM) classifier and 465 multi-domain features, extracted\nfrom multimodal clinical time series. The features consist of a set of\nphysiology-inspired features (n = 75), obtained by multiple steps of feature\nselection and expert analysis, and a set of physiology-agnostic features (n =\n390), derived from scattering transform. Results: The proposed algorithm is\nvalidated on the 2018 PhysioNet challenge dataset. The overall performance in\nterms of the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) is 0.50 on the\nhidden test dataset. This result is tied for the second-best score during the\nfollow-up and official phases of the 2018 PhysioNet challenge. Conclusions: The\nresults demonstrate that it is possible to automatically detect subtle\nnon-apneic/non-hypopneic arousal events from PSG recordings. Significance:\nAutomatic detection of subtle respiratory events such as RERAs together with\nother non-apneic/non-hypopneic arousals will allow detailed annotations of\nlarge PSG databases. This contributes to a better retrospective analysis of\nsleep data, which may also improve the quality of treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 15:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-09"}

In view of improved measurements from LHCb\nand BESIII experiments, we re-analyze the Cabibbo-favored $D \\to P\\!P$ and\n$V\\!P$ decays in the topological diagram approach. By assuming certain\nSU(3)-breaking effects in the tree-type amplitudes, we make predictions for\nboth branching fractions and CP asymmetries of the singly Cabibbo-suppressed\ndecay modes.

In the most general geometric approach to the theory of special\nrelativity, the principle of relativity, in contrast to Einstein formulation,\nis only a consequence of the (pseudo-Euclidean) geometry of space-time. The\nspace-time geometric approach deals with all possible choices of coordinates\n(clock synchronization conventions) of the chosen reference frames. In previous\npapers, we pointed out the very important role that the space-time geometric\napproach plays in accelerator engineering. The purpose of this paper is to\nprovide a novel insight into the problem of aberration of light based on the\nspace-time geometric approach. We will investigate the case of a\nplane-polarized light wave reflected from mirrors moving tangentially to its\nsurface. It is generally believed that there is no aberration (deviation of the\nenergy transport) for light reflected from mirrors moving transversely (also\nfor light transmitted through a hole in the moving opaque screen or,\nconsequently, through a moving open end of the telescope barrel). We show that\nthis typical textbook statement is incorrect. The aberration of starlight seems\nto be one of the simplest phenomena of astronomical observations. The lack of\nsymmetry, between the cases when either the source or detector is moving is\nshown clearly on the basis of the separation of binary stars. Such aberration\nis not observed. We have shown that the fact that we do not see myriads of\nwidely separated binaries in wild gyration does not require any fundamental\nchange of outlook, but it does require that aberration of \"distant\" stars\nshould be treated in the framework of space-time geometric approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 12:46:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 10:10:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

Alternatively, in many\ncases, such a payload does not have to be physically bound to the swimmer, but\nmay be instead manipulated and steered through the channel by the microrobot.\nWe investigate this problem of contactless manipulation of a microparticle by\nmobile microswimmer in a fluid at low Reynolds number. We consider a model of a\nmagnetically actuated artificial microswimmer, whose locomotion through a fluid\ninduces a disturbance velocity field in the fluid, that then acts to propel a\ncargo particle in its vicinity. The problem investigated in this paper is\ntherefore one of coupled locomotion-manipulation of two bodies in a fluid. The\nmagnetic swimmer's motion is actuated by an externally applied magnetic field\nof constant strength but whose direction rotates at a constant rate in a plane.\nThe swimmer propels itself in the direction perpendicular to this plane if the\nfrequency associated with the periodic magnetic field is above a critical\nfrequency. Below this critical frequency, the swimmer tumbles in place without\nnet locomotion. The coupled fluid-swimmer-cargo particle dynamics are solved\nnumerically using the method of Stokesian dynamics. The induced motion of the\ncargo particle is shown to be controllable. This is achieved by switching the\nplanes of rotation of the magnetic field and switching frequency of the\nmagnetic field above and below the critical frequency. While a swimmer with a\nspecific geometry has been used in the model, the results of this paper are\napplicable to swimmers with other geometries and means of propulsion.
