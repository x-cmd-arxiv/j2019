In such\nnetworking paradigms, controllers synchronize with each other, in attempts to\nmaintain a logically centralised network view. Despite the presence of various\ndesign proposals for distributed SDN controller architectures, most existing\nworks only aim at eliminating anomalies arising from the inconsistencies in\ndifferent controllers' network views. However, the performance aspect of\ncontroller synchronization designs with respect to given SDN applications are\ngenerally missing. To fill this gap, we formulate the controller\nsynchronization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and apply\nreinforcement learning techniques combined with deep neural networks (DNNs) to\ntrain a smart, scalable, and fine-grained controller synchronization policy,\ncalled the Multi-Armed Cooperative Synchronization (MACS), whose goal is to\nmaximise the performance enhancements brought by controller synchronizations.\nEvaluation results confirm the DNN's exceptional ability in abstracting latent\npatterns in the distributed SDN environment, rendering significant superiority\nto MACS-based synchronization policy, which are 56% and 30% performance\nimprovements over ONOS and greedy SDN controller synchronization heuristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 16:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-20"}

The region\ncorresponding to the VRS is identified by combining first principles modeling\nand wind tunnel experiments. Moreover, we propose that the so called WBS or\nautorotation region should also be avoided for quadcopters, which is not\nnecessarily the case for helicopters. A model is proposed for the velocity\nconstraints that the quadcopter must meet to avoid these regions. Then, the\nproblem of designing optimal time descend trajectories that avoid the VRS and\nWBS regions is tackled. Finally, the optimal trajectories are implemented on a\nquadcopter.

Theoretical analyses indicate parameter identifiability requires\ncovariates in the state processes. Simulation studies show that plugging in\nexternally estimated observation variances, as opposed to jointly estimating\nthem with other parameters, reduces bias and standard error of estimates. In\ncontrast to previous results for simple linear SSMs, strong confounding between\njointly estimated process and observation variance parameters was not found in\nthe models explored here. However, when observation variance was also estimated\nin the motivating case study, the resulting process variance estimates were\nimplausibly low (near-zero). As SSMs are used in increasingly complex ways,\nunderstanding when inference can be expected to be successful, and what aids\nit, becomes more important. Our study illustrates (i) the need for relevant\nprocess covariates and (ii) the benefits of using externally estimated\nobservation variances for inference for nonlinear stage-structured SSMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 17:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-20"}

It is however challenging because exoplanets are up to 1e10\ntimes fainter than their star and separated by a fraction of arcsecond. Current\ninstruments like SPHERE/VLT or GPI/Gemini detect young and massive planets\nbecause they are limited by non-common path aberrations (NCPA) that are not\ncorrected by the adaptive optics system. To probe fainter exoplanets, new\ninstruments capable of minimizing the NCPA is needed. One solution is the\nself-coherent camera (SCC) focal plane wavefront sensor, whose performance was\ndemonstrated in laboratory attenuating the starlight by factors up to several\n1e8 in space-like conditions at angular separations down to 2L/D. In this\npaper, we demonstrate the SCC on the sky for the first time. We installed an\nSCC on the stellar double coronagraph (SDC) instrument at the Hale telescope.\nWe used an internal source to minimize the NCPA that limited the vortex\ncoronagraph performance. We then compared to the standard procedure used at\nPalomar. On internal source, we demonstrated that the SCC improves the\ncoronagraphic detection limit by a factor between 4 and 20 between 1.5 and\n5L/D. Using this SCC calibration, the on-sky contrast is improved by a factor\nof 5 between 2 and 4L/D. These results prove the ability of the SCC to be\nimplemented in an existing instrument. This paper highlights two interests of\nthe self-coherent camera. First, the SCC can minimize the speckle intensity in\nthe field of view especially the ones that are very close to the star where\nmany exoplanets are to be discovered. Then, the SCC has a 100% efficiency with\nscience time as each image can be used for both science and NCPA minimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 17:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

It is possible that the\nexistence of new `dark sector' forces, yet undiscovered, are the key to solving\nthis fundamental problem, and one might hope that in the future such forces\nmight even be `unified' with the ones we already know in some UV-complete\nframework. In this paper, following a bottom-up approach, we attempt to take\nthe first steps in the construction of such a framework. The much-discussed\npossibility of the kinetic mixing (KM) of the `dark photon' with the\nhypercharge gauge boson of the SM via loops of portal matter (PM) fields,\ncharged in both sectors, offers an attractive starting point for these efforts.\nGiven the anticipated finite strength of the KM in a UV-complete theory, the\nabsence of anomalies, and the lifetime constraints on the PM fields arising\nfrom CMB and nucleosynthesis constraints, PM must behave as vector-like copies\nof the known SM fermion fields, such as those which appear naturally in\n$E_6$-type models. Within such a setup, the SM and their corresponding partner\nPM fields would be related by a new $SU(2)_I$ gauge symmetry. With this\nobservation as a springboard, we construct a generalization of these ideas\nwhere $SU(2)_I$ is augmented by an additional $U(1)_{I_Y}$ factor so that the\nlight dark photon is the result of a symmetry breaking analogous to the SM,\n\\ie, $SU(2)_I\\times U(1)_{I_Y}\\to U(1)_D$, but with $U(1)_D$ now also broken at\nthe $\\lesssim$ GeV scale. While SM fields are $U(1)_D$ singlets, as in the\nconventional dark photon approach, they transform nontrivially under the full\n$SU(2)_I\\times U(1)_{I_Y}$ gauge group. This approach leads to numerous\ninteresting signatures, both at low energies and at colliders, and can be\nviewed as an initial step in the construction of a more UV-complete framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 16:01:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 01:29:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 23:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

We explore the possible routes for the formation of CNTs in the ISM and\ncalculate their fingerprint vibrational spectral features in the infrared (IR).\n  Methods. We study the hydrogen-abstraction/acetylene-addition (HACA)\nmechanism and investigate the synthesis of nanotubes using density functional\ntheory (DFT). The IR vibrational spectra of CNTs and hydrogenated nanotubes\n(HNTs), as well as their cations, have also been obtained with DFT.\n  Results. We find that CNTs could be synthesized in space through a feasible\nformation pathway. CNTs and cationic CNTs, as well as their hydrogenated\ncounterparts, exhibit intense vibrational transitions in the IR. Their possible\npresence in the ISM could be investigated by comparing the calculated\nvibrational spectra with astronomical observations made by the Infrared Space\nObservatory, Spitzer Space Telescope, and particularly the upcoming James Webb\nSpace Telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 18:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

We consider a photonic metacrystal of distorted Kagome lattice\ngeometry that exhibits topological bulk polarization, leading to the emergence\nof 1D topological edge states and of higher order 0D states confined to the\ncorners of the structure. Interestingly, in addition to corner states due to\nthe nearest neighbour interactions and protected by generalized chiral symmetry\n1, we discover and take advantage of a new class of topological corner states\nsustained by long-range interactions, available in wave-based systems, such as\nin photonics. Our findings demonstrate that photonic HOTIs possess richer\nphysics compared to their condensed matter counterparts, offering opportunities\nfor engineering novel designer electromagnetic states with unique topological\nrobustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 19:21:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-23"}

Also at the\nbump, shear instability in the star leads to magnetic fields that occur\npreferentially on small length scales. Pneuman (1983) has suggested that the\nemergence of small scale flux tubes in the Sun can give rise to enhanced\nacceleration of the solar wind as a result of plasmoid acceleration (the melon\nseed mechanism). In this paper, we examine the Pneuman formalism to determine\nif it may shed some light on the process that drives mass loss from stars above\nthe bump. Because we do not currently have detailed information for some of the\nrelevant physical parameters, we are not yet able to derive a detailed model.\nInstead, our goal in this paper is to explore a proof of concept. Using\nparameters that are known to be plausible in cool giants, we find that the\ntotal mass loss rate from such stars can be replicated. Moreover, we find that\nthe radial profile of the wind speed in such stars can be steep or shallow\ndepending on the fraction of the mass loss which is contained in the plasmoids.\nThis is consistent with empirical data which indicate that the velocity\nprofiles of winds from cool giants range from shallow to steep.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 19:26:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Learning\nrepresentations in such a scenario is inherently complex due to the presence of\nmultiple heterogeneous information channels. These channels can encode both (a)\ninter-relations between the items of different modalities and (b)\nintra-relations between the items of the same modality. Encoding multimedia\nitems into a continuous low-dimensional semantic space such that both types of\nrelations are captured and preserved is extremely challenging, especially if\nthe goal is a unified end-to-end learning framework. The two key challenges\nthat need to be addressed are: 1) the framework must be able to merge complex\nintra and inter relations without losing any valuable information and 2) the\nlearning model should be invariant to the addition of new and potentially very\ndifferent modalities. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework which can\nscale to data streams from many modalities. To that end we introduce a\nhypergraph-based model for data representation and deploy Graph Convolutional\nNetworks to fuse relational information within and across modalities. Our\napproach provides an efficient solution for distributing otherwise extremely\ncomputationally expensive or even unfeasible training processes across\nmultiple-GPUs, without any sacrifices in accuracy. Moreover, adding new\nmodalities to our model requires only an additional GPU unit keeping the\ncomputational time unchanged, which brings representation learning to truly\nmultimodal datasets.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a neural network model that can detect human actions through walls\nand occlusions, and in poor lighting conditions. Our model takes radio\nfrequency (RF) signals as input, generates 3D human skeletons as an\nintermediate representation, and recognizes actions and interactions of\nmultiple people over time. By translating the input to an intermediate\nskeleton-based representation, our model can learn from both vision-based and\nRF-based datasets, and allow the two tasks to help each other.

We\nsearch for this thermalization effect by utilizing the D1D5 CFT to compute\neffective string interactions for $N=2$. This is done by turning on a marginal\ndeformation of the theory which twists together or untwists effective strings.\nFor a system to thermalize, the initial state, which is far from thermal, must\nredistribute it's energy via interactions until a thermal state is achieved. In\nour case, we consider excited states of the effective strings. We compute\nsplitting amplitudes for 1) one excitation going to three excitations and 2)\ntwo excitations going to four excitations using two insertions of the\ndeformation. Scenario 1) corresponds to a single particle moving in AdS.\nScenario 2) corresponds to two particles moving and colliding in AdS. We find\nthat the `1 to 3' amplitude has terms which oscillate with time, $t$, where $t$\nis the duration of the two deformations. We find that the `2 to 4' amplitude\nhas similar oscillatory terms as well as secular terms which grow like $t^2$.\nFor this case the growth implies that for large $t$ the excitations in the\ninitial state, which carry a given energy, prefer to redistribute themselves\namongst lower energy modes in the final state. This is a key feature of\nthermalization. Albeit in a simplified setting, we therefore argue that we have\nidentified the thermalization vertex in the D1D5 CFT, which after repeated\napplications, should lead to thermalization.

However, difficult atmospheric conditions, sensor\nmalfunctioning and scanning gaps between orbits frequently introduce spatial\ndiscontinuities into satellite-retri1eved LST products. For a single sensor,\nthere is also a trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution and,\ntherefore, it is impossible to obtain high temporal and spatial resolution\nsimultaneously. In recent years the reconstruction and spatiotemporal fusion of\nLST products have become active research topics that aim at overcoming this\nlimitation. They are two of most investigated approaches in thermal remote\nsensing and attract increasing attention, which has resulted in a number of\ndifferent algorithms.

Specifically, in the\ncase where a common eavesdropper decodes the signal directly and Eve's full\nchannel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter, we show that\nthe required transmit power can be further reduced by re-designing the\n`destructive region' of the constellations for symbol-level precoding and\nre-formulating the power minimization problem.

The concepts are used ambiguously and\nsometimes in contradictory ways, which has led to many imprecise beliefs about\ntheir implications. This paper outlines the simple view of state and causation\nin Promise Theory, which accounts for the scaling of processes and the\nrelativity of different observers in a natural way. It's shown that the\nconcepts of statefulness or statelessness are artifacts of observational scale\nand causal bias towards functional evaluation. If we include feedback loops,\nrecursion, and process convergence, which appear acausal to external observers,\nthe arguments about (im)mutable state need to be modified in a scale-dependent\nway. In most cases the intended focus of such remarks is not terms like\n`statelessness' but process predictability.

First, a counterfactual example generated by the state-of-the-art\nsystems is not necessarily representative of the underlying data distribution,\nand may therefore prescribe unachievable goals(e.g., an unsuccessful life\ninsurance applicant with severe disability may be advised to do more sports).\nSecondly, the counterfactuals may not be based on a \"feasible path\" between the\ncurrent state of the subject and the suggested one, making actionable recourse\ninfeasible (e.g., low-skilled unsuccessful mortgage applicants may be told to\ndouble their salary, which may be hard without first increasing their skill\nlevel). These two shortcomings may render counterfactual explanations\nimpractical and sometimes outright offensive. To address these two major flaws,\nfirst of all, we propose a new line of Counterfactual Explanations research\naimed at providing actionable and feasible paths to transform a selected\ninstance into one that meets a certain goal. Secondly, we propose FACE: an\nalgorithmically sound way of uncovering these \"feasible paths\" based on the\nshortest path distances defined via density-weighted metrics. Our approach\ngenerates counterfactuals that are coherent with the underlying data\ndistribution and supported by the \"feasible paths\" of change, which are\nachievable and can be tailored to the problem at hand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 08:29:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 15:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}

This process\nis conveniently characterized by the out-of-time-order commutators (OTOC),\nwhose time dependence reveals salient aspects of the system's dynamics. Here we\nstudy the spatially local spin correlation function i.e., the expectation value\nof spin commutator and the corresponding OTOC of Dirac--Weyl systems in one,\ntwo, and three spatial dimensions. The OTOC can be written as the square of the\nexpectation value of the commutator and the variance of the commutator. In\nprinciple, the problem features two energy scales, the chemical potential, and\nthe high energy cutoff. We find that only the latter is dominant, therefore the\ntime evolution is separated into only two different regions. The spin\ncorrelation function grows linearly with time initially and decays as $t^{-2}$\nfor late times. The OTOC reveals a universal $t^2$ initial growth from both the\ncommutator and the variance while its late time decay, $t^{-2}$ originates from\nthe variance of the commutator. This late time decay is identified as a\ncharacteristic signature or Dirac-Weyl fermions. These features remain present\nalso at finite temperatures. Our results indicate that Dirac--Weyl systems are\nslow information scramblers and are essential when additional channels for\nscrambling, i.e., interaction or disorder are analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 09:00:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 09:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

Identifying smaller\nrepresentative data samples with strategies like active learning can help\nmitigate such bottlenecks. Previous works on active learning in NLP identify\nthe problem of sampling bias in the samples acquired by uncertainty-based\nquerying and develop costly approaches to address it. Using a large empirical\nstudy, we demonstrate that active set selection using the posterior entropy of\ndeep models like FastText.zip (FTZ) is robust to sampling biases and to various\nalgorithmic choices (query size and strategies) unlike that suggested by\ntraditional literature. We also show that FTZ based query strategy produces\nsample sets similar to those from more sophisticated approaches (e.g ensemble\nnetworks). Finally, we show the effectiveness of the selected samples by\ncreating tiny high-quality datasets, and utilizing them for fast and cheap\ntraining of large models. Based on the above, we propose a simple baseline for\ndeep active text classification that outperforms the state-of-the-art.

We used asteroid\nphotometry compiled in the Lowell Observatory photometry database with\nphotometry from the Gaia Data Release 2. Both data sources are available for\nabout 5400 asteroids.

The basic idea is to use a family of plane waves parametrized by\ncoordinates of the space of geodesics i.e. kinematic space. This idea enables a\nsimple calculation of the Berry curvature living on kinematic space. As a\nresult we recover the Crofton form with a coefficient depending on the\nscattering energy. In arriving at these results the space of horocycles is\nused. We show that this new space used in concert with kinematic space\nincorporates naturally the gauge degrees of freedom responsible for an analogue\nof Berry's Phase. Horocycles also give a new geometric look to the strong\nsubadditivity relation in terms of lambda lengths giving rise to shear\ncoordinates of geodesic quadrangles. A generalization for geodesic polygons\nthen reveals an interesting connection with $A_{n}$ cluster algebras. Here the\ncluster variables are the lambda lengths related to the regularized entropies\nof the boundary via the Ryu-Takayanagi relation. An elaboration of this idea\nindicates that cluster algebras might provide a natural algebraic means for\nencoding the gauge invariant entanglement patterns of certain boundary\nentangled states in the geometry of bulk geodesics. Finally using the language\nof integral geometry we show how certain propagators connected to the bulk,\nboundary and kinematic spaces are related to data of elementary scattering\nproblems. We also present some hints how these ideas might be generalized for\nmore general holographic scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 12:03:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

We demonstrate that\nthe evolution of the skyrmion phase with the curvature is controlled by the\ncompetition between two characteristic lengths, namely the curvature radius,\n$R$ (geometrical length) and the skyrmion radius, $R_{sk}$ (physical length).\nIn narrow nanotubes ($R<R_{sk}$) the skyrmion phase evolves to a stripe phase,\nwhile in wide nanotubes ($R>R_{sk}$) a mixed skyrmion-stripe phase emerges.\nMost interestingly, the mixed phase is characterized by spatially separated\nskyrmions from stripes owing to the direction of the applied field relative to\nthe surface normal. In the stability regime ($R \\gtrsim R_{sk}$) skyrmions\nremain circular and preserve their size as a consequence of their topological\nprotection. Zero-field skyrmions are shown to be stable on curved nanoelements\nwith free boundaries within the same stability region ($R\\gtrsim R_{sk}$). The\nexperimental and technological perspectives from the stability of skyrmions on\ncylindrical surfaces are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 12:55:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 16:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}

The generalized controller type employs the RDW method\nand manipulation quantities according to a certain procedure depending on the\nuser's position in relation to the real space.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which have\nshown to be successful in various medical image analysis tasks including\nsegmentation are typically sensitive to the variations in imaging parameters.\nThis sensitivity leads to poor segmentation performance of CNNs trained on a\nsource cohort and tested on a target cohort from a different scanner and hence,\nit limits the applicability of CNNs for cross-cohort training and testing.\nContouring prostate whole gland and transition zone in DWI images are\ntime-consuming and expensive.

Through the focus on processes,\nthey create process models that require management, including support for\nversioning, refactoring and querying. Querying thus far has primarily focused\non structural properties of models rather than on exploiting behavioral\nproperties capturing aspects of model execution. While the latter is more\nchallenging, it is also more effective, especially when models are used for\nauditing or process automation. The focus of this paper is to overcome the\nchallenges associated with behavioral querying of process models in order to\nunlock its benefits. The first challenge concerns determining decidability of\nthe building blocks of the query language, which are the possible behavioral\nrelations between process tasks. The second challenge concerns achieving\nacceptable performance of query evaluation. The evaluation of a query may\nrequire expensive checks in all process models, of which there may be\nthousands. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a special-purpose\nprogramming language, namely Process Query Language (PQL) for behavioral\nquerying of process model collections. The language relies on a set of\nbehavioral predicates between process tasks, whose usefulness has been\nempirically evaluated with a pool of process model stakeholders. This study\nresulted in a selection of the predicates to be implemented in PQL, whose\ndecidability has also been formally proven.

Based on an atomic-scale tight-binding model, we develop a numerically\ntractable approximation to the polarization function and study its behavior for\ndifferent twist angles. We find that the polarization has three different\nmomentum regimes. For small momenta, the polarization is quadratic, leading to\na linear dielectric function expected for a two-dimensional dielectric\nmaterial. For large momenta, the polarization becomes independent of the twist\nangle and approaches that of uncoupled graphene layers.

Close to the\nlargest magic angle the dielectric function peaks at a momentum of $~1/(4 \\:\nnm)$ attaining values of 25, meaning very strong screening at intermediate\ndistances. We also calculate the effective screened Coulomb interaction in real\nspace and give estimates for the on-site and extended interaction terms for the\nrecently developed hexagonal-lattice model.

In particular, the computed contraction\nmetric is interpolated by a continuous piecewise affine (CPA) metric at the\nvertices of a fixed triangulation, and by checking finitely many inequalities,\nwe can verify that the interpolation is a contraction metric. Moreover, we show\nthat, using sufficiently dense collocation points and a sufficiently fine\ntriangulation, we always succeed with the construction and verification. We\napply the method to two examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 15:21:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

Such method is\nanalytically applied for a conducting hemisphere on a flat plate, confirming\nthe known result of $\\gamma_a = 3$. Also, it is applied on a hemi-ellipsoid on\na plate where the values of the apex FEF are compared with the ones extracted\nfrom the analytical expression. Then, the method is applied for the hemisphere\non a cylindrical post (HCP) model. In this case, to analytically estimate the\napex FEF from first principles is a problem of considerable complexity. Despite\nthe slow convergence of the apex FEF, useful analytical conclusions are drawn\nand explored, such as, it is confirmed that all even multipole contributions of\nthe HCP model are zero, which in turn leads to restrictions on the charge\ndensity distribution: it will be shown the surface charge density must be an\nodd function with respect to height in an equivalent system. Also, expressions\nfound for the apex FEF depend explicitly on the aspect ratio, that is, the\nratio of height by base radius. Using the dominant multipole contribution, the\ndipole, at sufficient large distances, it is shown that, for two interacting\nemitters, as their separation distance increases, the fractional change in apex\nFEF, $\\delta$, decreases following a power law with exponent $-3$. The result\nis extended for conducting emitters having an arbitrary axially-symmetric\nshape, where it is also shown $\\delta$ has a pre-factor depending on geometry,\nconfirming the tendency observed in recent analytical and numerical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 15:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

Sound financial theories demonstrate that in an\nefficient marketplace all information available today, including expectations\non future events, are represented in today prices whereas future price trend is\ndriven by the uncertainty. This jeopardizes the efforts put in designing\nprediction models. To deal with the unpredictability of financial systems,\ntoday's portfolio management is largely based on the Markowitz framework which\nputs more emphasis in the analysis of the market uncertainty and less in the\nprice prediction. The limitation of the Markowitz framework stands in taking\nvery strong ideal assumptions about future returns probability distribution.\n  To address this situation we propose PAGAN, a pioneering methodology based on\ndeep generative models. The goal is modeling the market uncertainty that\nultimately is the main factor driving future trends.

These tools allow data analysts to represent\nmultidimensional data in a 2D or 3D space, while preserving as much relevant\ninformation as possible. Yet, they cannot preserve all structures\nsimultaneously and they induce some unavoidable distortions. Hence, many\ncriteria have been introduced to evaluate a map's overall quality, mostly based\non the preservation of neighbourhoods. Such global indicators are currently\nused to compare several maps, which helps to choose the most appropriate\nmapping method and its hyperparameters. However, those aggregated indicators\ntend to hide the local repartition of distortions. Thereby, they need to be\nsupplemented by local evaluation to ensure correct interpretation of maps.

It is evident that a method\ncapable of forecasting and analyzing the future of these players on-field\nantics shall assist the management to a great extent. In a simulated\nenvironment like the Fantasy Premier League, enthusiasts from all over the\nworld participate and manage the players catalogue for the entire season. Due\nto the dynamic nature of points system, there is no known approach for the\nformulation of a dream team. This study aims to tackle this problem by using a\nhybrid of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Recurrent Neural\nNetworks (RNNs) for time series prediction of player points and subsequent\nmaximization of total points using Linear Programming (LPP). Given the player\npoints for the past three seasons, the predictions have been made for the\ncurrent season by modeling differently for ARIMA and RNN, and then creating an\nensemble of the same. Prior to that, proper data preprocessing techniques were\ndeployed to enhance the efficacy of the prepared model. Constraints on the type\nof players like goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders and forwards along with the\ntotal budget were effectively optimized using LPP approach. The validation of\nthe proposed team was done with the performance in upcoming season, where the\nplayers outperform as expected, and helped in strengthening the feasibility of\nthe solution. Likewise, the proposed approach can be extended to English\nPremier League by official managers on-field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 20:20:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

Financial institutions are the front line in the\nwar against financial crime and accordingly, must devote substantial human and\ntechnology resources to this effort. Current processes to detect financial\nmisconduct have limitations in their ability to effectively differentiate\nbetween malicious behavior and ordinary financial activity. These limitations\ntend to result in gross over-reporting of suspicious activity that necessitate\ntime-intensive and costly manual review. Advances in technology used in this\ndomain, including machine learning based approaches, can improve upon the\neffectiveness of financial institutions' existing processes, however, a key\nchallenge that most financial institutions continue to face is that they\naddress financial crimes in isolation without any insight from other firms.\nWhere financial institutions address financial crimes through the lens of their\nown firm, perpetrators may devise sophisticated strategies that may span across\ninstitutions and geographies. Financial institutions continue to work\nrelentlessly to advance their capabilities, forming partnerships across\ninstitutions to share insights, patterns and capabilities. These public-private\npartnerships are subject to stringent regulatory and data privacy requirements,\nthereby making it difficult to rely on traditional technology solutions. In\nthis paper, we propose a methodology to share key information across\ninstitutions by using a federated graph learning platform that enables us to\nbuild more accurate machine learning models by leveraging federated learning\nand also graph learning approaches.

Then, the compiler has to determine how many instructions to pack\ntogether and how many loop iterations to interleave. Compilers are designed\ntoday to use fixed-cost models that are based on heuristics to make\nvectorization decisions on loops. However, these models are unable to capture\nthe data dependency, the computation graph, or the organization of\ninstructions. Alternatively, software engineers often hand-write the\nvectorization factors of every loop. This, however, places a huge burden on\nthem, since it requires prior experience and significantly increases the\ndevelopment time. In this work, we explore a novel approach for handling loop\nvectorization and propose an end-to-end solution using deep reinforcement\nlearning (RL). We conjecture that deep RL can capture different instructions,\ndependencies, and data structures to enable learning a sophisticated model that\ncan better predict the actual performance cost and determine the optimal\nvectorization factors. We develop an end-to-end framework, from code to\nvectorization, that integrates deep RL in the LLVM compiler. Our proposed\nframework takes benchmark codes as input and extracts the loop codes. These\nloop codes are then fed to a loop embedding generator that learns an embedding\nfor these loops. Finally, the learned embeddings are used as input to a Deep RL\nagent, which determines the vectorization factors for all the loops. We further\nextend our framework to support multiple supervised learning methods. We\nevaluate our approaches against the currently used LLVM vectorizer and loop\npolyhedral optimization techniques. Our experiments show 1.29X-4.73X\nperformance speedup compared to baseline and only 3% worse than the brute-force\nsearch on a wide range of benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 12:29:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2019 12:29:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 2019 22:57:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 4 Jan 2020 09:11:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

When the passengers give\ninstructions to AMIE, the agent should parse such commands properly considering\navailable three modalities (language/text, audio, video) and trigger the\nappropriate functionality of the AV system.
