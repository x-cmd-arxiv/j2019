In this paper, we\npropose an effective and efficient detection network to hunt pedestrians in\ncrowd scenes. The proposed method, namely PedHunter, introduces strong\nocclusion handling ability to existing region-based detection networks without\nbringing extra computations in the inference stage. Specifically, we design a\nmask-guided module to leverage the head information to enhance the feature\nrepresentation learning of the backbone network. Moreover, we develop a strict\nclassification criterion by improving the quality of positive samples during\ntraining to eliminate common false positives of pedestrian detection in crowded\nscenes. Besides, we present an occlusion-simulated data augmentation to enrich\nthe pattern and quantity of occlusion samples to improve the occlusion\nrobustness. As a consequent, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three\npedestrian detection datasets including CityPersons, Caltech-USA and\nCrowdHuman. To facilitate further studies on the occluded pedestrian detection\nin surveillance scenes, we release a new pedestrian dataset, called SUR-PED,\nwith a total of over 162k high-quality manually labeled instances in 10k\nimages. The proposed dataset, source codes and trained models will be released.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Sep 2019 16:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}

A common wisdom is that\nif two documents are similar in terms of the same query, they are more likely\nto have similar relevance score. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, we\npropose a multi-agent reinforced ranking model, named MarlRank. In particular,\nby considering each document as an agent, we formulate the ranking process as a\nmulti-agent Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the mutual interactions among\ndocuments are incorporated in the ranking process. To compute the ranking list,\neach document predicts its relevance to a query considering not only its own\nquery-document features but also its similar documents features and actions.

The\nfrictional force and torque that can be transmitted through a nonplanar surface\ncontact are both three-dimensional, resulting in a six-dimensional frictional\nwrench (6DFW). Applying traditional planar contact models to such contacts\nleads to over-conservative results as the models do not consider the nonplanar\nsurface geometry and only compute a three-dimensional subset of the 6DFW. To\naddress this issue, we derive the 6DFW for nonplanar surfaces by combining\nconcepts of differential geometry and Coulomb friction. We also propose two 6D\nlimit surface (6DLS) models, generalized from well-known three-dimensional LS\n(3DLS) models, which describe the friction-motion constraints for a contact.

However, these peer-to-peer\nnetworks also introduce a new attack surface which is not well-understood\ntoday. This paper identifies and analyzes, a novel Denial-of-Service attack\nwhich is based on route hijacking, i.e., which exploits the way transactions\nare routed and executed along the created channels of the network. This attack\nis conceptually interesting as even a limited attacker that manipulates the\ntopology through the creation of new channels can navigate tradeoffs related to\nthe way it attacks the network. Furthermore, the attack also highlights a\nfundamental design tradeoff for the defender (who determines its own routes):\nto become less predictable and hence secure, a rational node has to pay higher\nfees to nodes that forward its payments. We find that the three most common\nimplementations for payment channels in Bitcoin (lnd, C-lightning, Eclair)\napproach routing differently. We begin by surveying the current state of the\nLightning network and explore the routes chosen by these implementations. We\nfind that in the current network nearly 60\\% of all routes pass through only\nfive nodes, while 80\\% go through only 10 nodes. Thus, a relatively small\nnumber of colluding nodes can deny service to a large fraction of the network.\n  We then turn to study an external attacker who creates links to the network\nand draws more routes through its nodes by asking for lower fees. We find that\njust five new links are enough to draw the majority (65\\% - 75\\%) of the\ntraffic regardless of the implementation being used. The cost of creating these\nlinks is very low.\n  We discuss the differences between implementations and eventually derive our\nown suggested routing policy, which is based on a novel combination of existing\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Sep 2019 21:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}

To do this, we use Theory of Mind (ToM) which helps us in explicitly\nmodeling human's intention, machine's mind as inferred by the human as well as\nhuman's mind as inferred by the machine. In other words, these explicit mental\nrepresentations in ToM are incorporated to learn an optimal explanation policy\nthat takes into account human's perception and beliefs.

In this paper, we propose SAFARI, a general framework\nformulated by abstracting and unifying the fundamental tasks in streaming\nanomaly detection, which provides a flexible and extensible anomaly detection\nprocedure to overcome the limitations of one-size-fits-all solutions. SAFARI\nhelps to facilitate more elaborate algorithm comparisons by allowing us to\nisolate the effects of shared and unique characteristics of different\nalgorithms on detection performance. Using SAFARI, we have implemented various\nanomaly detectors and identified a research gap that motivates us to propose a\nnovel learning strategy in this work. We conducted an extensive evaluation\nstudy of 20 detectors that are composed using SAFARI and compared their\nperformances using real-world benchmark datasets with different properties.

First, it allows us to obtain information\nabout genes which do not have exact matches by measuring their similarity to\nother ones in the database.

However, even if the\ndatabase is unlabeled it allows us to find clusters and infer some\ncharacteristics of the gene population.

We find that the stochastic algorithm is already competitive with the\ndeterministic algorithm for small active spaces, containing as few as 14\norbitals. We illustrate the utility of our stochastic formulation using\nbenchmark applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 02:03:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 06:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

To address this issue, in this paper we propose a novel\nCollaborative Memory Network (CM-Net) based on the well-designed block, named\nCM-block. The CM-block firstly captures slot-specific and intent-specific\nfeatures from memories in a collaborative manner, and then uses these enriched\nfeatures to enhance local context representations, based on which the\nsequential information flow leads to more specific (slot and intent) global\nutterance representations. Through stacking multiple CM-blocks, our CM-Net is\nable to alternately perform information exchange among specific memories, local\ncontexts and the global utterance, and thus incrementally enriches each other.\nWe evaluate the CM-Net on two standard benchmarks (ATIS and SNIPS) and a\nself-collected corpus (CAIS).

Despite the huge\nbenefits, current MLaaS solutions still lack strong assurances on: 1) service\ncorrectness (i.e., whether the MLaaS works as expected); 2) trustworthy\naccounting (i.e., whether the bill for the MLaaS resource consumption is\ncorrectly accounted); 3) fair payment (i.e., whether a client gets the entire\nMLaaS result before making the payment). Without these assurances, unfaithful\nservice providers can return improperly-executed ML task results or partially\ntrained ML models while asking for over-claimed rewards. Moreover, it is hard\nto argue for wide adoption of MLaaS to both the client and the service\nprovider, especially in the open market without a trusted third party. In this\npaper, we present VeriML, a novel and efficient framework to bring integrity\nassurances and fair payments to MLaaS.

We first establish the static planning problem by considering\ntime-invariant system parameters and determine the optimal static policy. While\nthe static policy provides stability of customer queues waiting for rides even\nif consider the system dynamics, we see that it is inefficient to utilize a\nstatic policy as it can lead to long wait times for customers and low profits.\nTo accommodate for the stochastic nature of trip demands, renewable energy\navailability, and electricity prices and to further optimally manage the\nautonomous fleet given the need to generate integer allocations, a real-time\npolicy is required. The optimal real-time policy that executes actions based on\nfull state information of the system is the solution of a complex dynamic\nprogram. However, we argue that it is intractable to exactly solve for the\noptimal policy using exact dynamic programming methods and therefore apply deep\nreinforcement learning to develop a near-optimal control policy.

A representation is learned in an end-to-end self-supervised\nframework for predicting dense optical flow from a single frame with paired\nsensing data. We postulate that success on this task requires the network to\nlearn semantic and geometric knowledge in the ego-centric view. For example,\nforecasting a future view to be seen from a moving vehicle requires an\nunderstanding of scene depth, scale, and movement of objects. We demonstrate\nthat our learned representation can benefit other tasks that require detailed\nscene understanding and outperforms competing unsupervised representations on\nsemantic segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 04:12:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}

In contrast to existing works that assume known object templates,\nwe are interested in manipulation planning for a category of objects with\npotentially unknown instances and large intra-category shape variation. To\nachieve it, we need an object representation with which the manipulation\nplanner can reason about both the physical feasibility and desired object\nconfiguration, while being generalizable to novel instances. The widely-used\npose representation is not suitable, as representing an object with a\nparameterized transformation from a fixed template cannot capture large\nintra-category shape variation. Hence, we propose a new hybrid object\nrepresentation consisting of semantic keypoint and dense geometry (a point\ncloud or mesh) as the interface between the perception module and motion\nplanner. Leveraging advances in learning-based keypoint detection and shape\ncompletion, both dense geometry and keypoints can be perceived from raw sensor\ninput. Using the proposed hybrid object representation, we formulate the\nmanipulation task as a motion planning problem which encodes both the object\ntarget configuration and physical feasibility for a category of objects. In\nthis way, many existing manipulation planners can be generalized to categories\nof objects, and the resulting perception-to-action manipulation pipeline is\nrobust to large intra-category shape variation. Extensive hardware experiments\ndemonstrate our pipeline can produce robot trajectories that accomplish tasks\nwith never-before-seen objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 04:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}

We develop rich state representations that\ncombine supervised and unsupervised environment data. Our approach takes a\ncross-modal perspective, where separate modalities correspond to the raw camera\ndata and the system states relevant to the task, such as the relative pose of\ngates to the drone in the case of drone racing.

There has been a lack of research for\nlong-term planning oriented applications. Currently, most utility companies\nstill rely on static rating numbers when planning power transformers for the\nnext few years. In response, this paper proposes a novel and comprehensive\nmethod to analyze the past 5-year temperature, loading and load composition\ndata of existing power transformers in a planning region. Based on such data\nand the forecasted area load composition, a future power transformer loading\nprofile can be constructed by using Gaussian Mixture Model. Then according to\nIEEE std. C57.91-2011, a power transformer thermal aging model can be\nestablished to incorporate future loading and temperature profiles. As a\nresult, annual continuous dynamic rating profiles under different temperature\nscenarios can be determined. The profiles can reflect the long-term thermal\noverloading risk in a much more realistic and granular way, which can\nsignificantly improve the accuracy of power transformer planning. A real\nutility application example in Canada has been presented to demonstrate the\npracticality and usefulness of this method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 05:37:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Sep 2019 04:12:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 04:24:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-02"}

Yet, previous studies of nonthermal sputtering disregarded the fact\nthat dust grains can be spun-up to suprathermal rotation by stochastic\nmechanical torques from gas-grain collisions. In this paper, we show that such\ngrain suprathermal rotation can disrupt a small grain into small fragments\nbecause induced centrifugal stress exceeds the maximum tensile strength of\ngrain material, $S_{\\rm max}$. We term this mechanism {\\it MEchanical Torque\nDisruption} (METD).

We finally discuss implications\nof the METD mechanism for the destruction of hypersonic grains accelerated by\nradiation pressure as well as grains in fast shocks.

Although traditional\ngeneral methods such as simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithms (GA) and\nso forth have been devised to these hard problems, their accuracy and time\nconsumption are not satisfying in practice. In this work, we proposed a simple,\nfast, and general algorithm framework called Gumbel-softmax Optimization (GSO)\nfor COPs.

The\nlatter acts as a thermometric probe, with its temperature and chemical\npotential set so that there is neither particle nor heat current between the\ntwo subsystems. We argue that the probe temperature can be attributed to the\nfew-fermion eigenstate in the sense that (i) it varies smoothly with energy\nfrom eigenstate to eigenstate, (ii) it is equal to the temperature obtained\nfrom a thermodynamic relation in a wide energy range, (iii) it is independent\nof details of the coupling between the two systems in a finite parameter range,\n(iv) it satisfies the transitivity condition underlying the zeroth law of\nthermodynamics and (v) it is consistent with Carnot's theorem.

For this\ntype of approach, uncertainty-aware modeling is essential because precise\nprediction is impossible. However, previous studies have relied on only a\nsingle prediction without incorporating uncertainty, which can cause critical\ntracking errors if the prediction is unreliable. This paper proposes an\nextension to this approach with Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). This naturally\nreformulates the tracking scheme to handle multiple predictions (or hypotheses)\nof poses, thereby mitigating the negative effect of prediction errors. An\nimportant component of SMC, i.e., a proposal distribution, is designed as a\nprobabilistic neural pose predictor, which can propose diverse and plausible\nhypotheses by incorporating epistemic uncertainty and heteroscedastic aleatoric\nuncertainty. In addition, a recurrent architecture is introduced to our neural\nmodeling to utilize time-sequence information of poses to manage difficult\nsituations, such as the frequent disappearance and reappearances of poses.\nCompared to existing baselines, the proposed method achieves a state-of-the-art\nMOTA score on the PoseTrack2018 validation dataset by reducing approximately\n50% of tracking errors from a state-of-the art baseline method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 07:25:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 07:54:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-28"}

Non-renewal behavior is characterized by the\nemergence of correlations between successive first-passage times of detection\nin one of the leads. Our method of including telegraphic switching is general\nfor any source-molecule-drain setup, but we consider three specific cases. In\nthe first, we model stochastic transitions between an Anderson impurity with\nand without an applied magnetic field $B$. The last two scenarios couple the\nelectronic level to a single vibrational mode via the Holstein model. We then\nstochastically switch between two vibrational conformations, with different\nelectron-phonon coupling and vibrational frequency, which corresponds to\ndifferent molecular conformations. Finally, we model the molecule attaching and\ndetaching from an electrode by switching between two different\nmolecule-electrode coupling strengths. We find, for all three cases, that\nincluding the telegraph process in the master equation induces relatively\nstrong positive correlations, with Pearson coefficient $p \\approx 0.5$, between\nsuccessive first-passage times.

Promising\nprogresses have been made with the prevalence of deep Convolutional Neural\nNetworks. Existing methods widely employ the Euclidean distance (i.e., $L_2$\nloss) to optimize the model, which, however, has two main drawbacks: (1) the\nloss has difficulty in learning the spatial awareness (i.e., the position of\nhead) since it struggles to retain the high-frequency variation in the density\nmap, and (2) the loss is highly sensitive to various noises in crowd counting,\nsuch as the zero-mean noise, head size changes, and occlusions. Although the\nMaximum Excess over SubArrays (MESA) loss has been previously proposed to\naddress the above issues by finding the rectangular subregion whose predicted\ndensity map has the maximum difference from the ground truth, it cannot be\nsolved by gradient descent, thus can hardly be integrated into the deep\nlearning framework. In this paper, we present a novel architecture called\nSPatial Awareness Network (SPANet) to incorporate spatial context for crowd\ncounting. The Maximum Excess over Pixels (MEP) loss is proposed to achieve this\nby finding the pixel-level subregion with high discrepancy to the ground truth.\nTo this end, we devise a weakly supervised learning scheme to generate such\nregion with a multi-branch architecture. The proposed framework can be\nintegrated into existing deep crowd counting methods and is end-to-end\ntrainable.

In the past, the calibration\nof the material properties was done manually by trial and error approaches,\nwhich was inefficient and prone to error.

We\nexplore a new solution for NAS and human pose estimation task: part-specific\nneural architecture search, which can be seen as a variant of multi-task\nlearning. Firstly, we design a new neural architecture search space, Cell-based\nNeural Fabric (CNF), to learn micro as well as macro neural architecture using\na differentiable search strategy. Then, we view locating human keypoints as\nmultiple disentangled prediction sub-tasks, and then use prior knowledge of\nbody structure as guidance to search for multiple part-specific neural\narchitectures for different human parts. After search, all these part-specific\nCNFs have distinct micro and macro architecture parameters.

Current referring expression\nmethods have achieved good performance. However, none of them is able to\nachieve real-time inference without accuracy drop. The reason for the\nrelatively slow inference speed is that these methods artificially split the\nreferring expression comprehension into two sequential stages including\nproposal generation and proposal ranking. It does not exactly conform to the\nhabit of human cognition. To this end, we propose a novel Realtime\nCross-modality Correlation Filtering method (RCCF). RCCF reformulates the\nreferring expression comprehension as a correlation filtering process. The\nexpression is first mapped from the language domain to the visual domain and\nthen treated as a template (kernel) to perform correlation filtering on the\nimage feature map. The peak value in the correlation heatmap indicates the\ncenter points of the target box. In addition, RCCF also regresses a 2-D object\nsize and 2-D offset. The center point coordinates, object size and center point\noffset together to form the target bounding box. Our method runs at 40 FPS\nwhile achieving leading performance in RefClef, RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg\nbenchmarks. In the challenging RefClef dataset, our methods almost double the\nstate-of-the-art performance (34.70% increased to 63.79%).

To\naddress this problem, we propose to memorize temporal consistency in the video\nsequence, and leverage it for the task of depth prediction. To this end, we\nintroduce a two-stream CNN with a flow-guided memory module, where each stream\nencodes visual and temporal features, respectively. The memory module,\nimplemented using convolutional gated recurrent units (ConvGRUs), inputs visual\nand temporal features sequentially together with optical flow tailored to our\ntask. It memorizes trajectories of individual features selectively and\npropagates spatial information over time, enforcing a long-term temporal\nconsistency to prediction results. We evaluate our method on the KITTI\nbenchmark dataset in terms of depth prediction accuracy, temporal consistency\nand runtime, and achieve a new state of the art.

The high-field (HF) state, existing above\n$\\sim$18 T, i.e., above $\\sim$1/2 of the saturated magnetization, is an\nincommensurate magnetically ordered state and not the spin-nematic state, as\ntheoretically predicted for the isotropic frustrated spin-1/2 chain. The HF\nstate is likely driven by sizable interchain interactions and symmetric\nintrachain anisotropies uncovered in previous studies. Consequently, the\npotential existence of the spin nematic phase in $\\beta$-TeVO$_4$ is limited to\na narrow field range, i.e., a few tenths of a tesla bellow the saturation of\nthe magnetization, as also found in other frustrated spin-1/2 chain compounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 09:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

The level of\nindecision of a given agent is modeled by its propensity to vote for one of the\ntwo alternatives, represented by a variable $p \\in [0,1]$. When an agent $i$\ninteracts with another agent $j$ with propensity $p_j$, then $i$ either\nincreases its propensity $p_i$ by $h$ with probability $P_{ij}=\\omega\np_i+(1-\\omega)p_j$, or decreases $p_i$ by $h$ with probability $1-P_{ij}$,\nwhere $h$ is a fixed step. We analyze the system by a rate equation approach\nand contrast the results with Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the\ndynamics of propensities depends on the weight $\\omega$ that an agent assigns\nto its own propensity. When all the weight is assigned to the interacting\npartner ($\\omega=0$), agents' propensities are quickly driven to one of the\nextreme values $p=0$ or $p=1$, until an extremist absorbing consensus is\nachieved. However, for $\\omega>0$ the system first reaches a quasi-stationary\nstate of symmetric polarization where the distribution of propensities has the\nshape of an inverted Gaussian with a minimum at the center $p=1/2$ and two\nmaxima at the extreme values $p=0,1$, until the symmetry is broken and the\nsystem is driven to an extremist consensus. A linear stability analysis shows\nthat the lifetime of the polarized state, estimated by the mean consensus time\n$\\tau$, diverges as $\\tau \\sim (1-\\omega)^{-2} \\ln N$ when $\\omega$ approaches\n$1$, where $N$ is the system size. Finally, a continuous approximation allows\nto derive a transport equation whose convection term is compatible with a drift\nof particles from the center towards the extremes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 09:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

We find distinct\ninside-out growth of the Milky Way disk; the best fit model implies that the\nhalf-mass radius of the Milky Way disk has grown by 43\\% over the last 7 Gyr.\nYet, such inside-out growth still results in present-day age gradient weaker\nthan 0.1 Gyr/kpc. Our model predicts the half-mass and half-light sizes of the\nGalactic disk at earlier epochs, which can be compared to the observed redshift\n-size relations of disk galaxies. We show that radial orbit migration can\nreconcile the distinct disk-size evolution with redshift, also expected from\ncosmological simulations, with the modest present-day age gradients seen in the\nMilky Way and other galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 10:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

Emerging software defined networking and cloud\ncomputing need to update the rulesets frequently for flexible policy\nconfiguration. Their success depends on the availability of the new generation\nof classifiers that can support both fast ruleset updating and high-speed\npacket classification. However, existing packet classification approaches focus\neither on high-speed packet classification or fast rule update, but no known\nscheme meets both requirements. In this paper, we propose Range-vector Hash\n(RVH) to effectively accelerate the packet classification with a hash-based\nalgorithm while ensuring the fast rule update. RVH is built on our key\nobservation that the number of distinct combinations of each field prefix\nlengths is not evenly distributed. To reduce the number of hash tables for fast\nclassification, we introduce a novel concept range-vector with each specified\nthe length range of each field prefix of the projected rules. RVH can overcome\nthe major obstacle that hinders hash-based packet classification by balancing\nthe number of hash tables and the probability of hash collision. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that RVH can achieve the classification speed up to 15.7\ntimes and the update speed up to 2.3 times that of the state-of-the-art\nalgorithms on average, while only consuming 44% less memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 12:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}

While in absence of such a coupling the model is\nlocalized as expected for the one dimensional Anderson model, increasing the\ncoupling with the GOE perturbation we find a delocalization transition to a\nconducting one driven by the proliferation of quantum avalanches which does not\nfit the standard paradigm of Anderson localization. In particular an\nintermediate Griffiths region emerges, where exponentially distributed\ninsulating segments coexist with a few, rare resonances. Typical correlations\ndecay exponentially fast, while average correlations decay as stretched\nexponential and diverge with the length of the chain, indicating that the\nconducting inclusions have a fractal structure and that the localization length\nis broadly distributed at the critical point. This behavior is consistent with\na Kosterlitz-Thouless-like criticality of the transition.

Without explanations, users may not\nunderstand why product search engines retrieve certain items for them, which\nconsequentially leads to imperfect user experience and suboptimal system\nperformance in practice. In this work, we tackle this problem by constructing\nexplainable retrieval models for product search.

However,\nAW-projection quickly becomes prohibitively expensive when the corrections vary\nover short time scales. This occurs for example when ionospheric effects are\nincluded in the correction. The cost of the frequent recomputation of the\noversampled convolution kernels then dominates the total cost of gridding.\n  Image domain gridding is a new approach that avoids the costly step of\ncomputing oversampled convolution kernels. Instead low-resolution images are\nmade directly for small groups of visibilities which are then transformed and\nadded to the large $uv$ grid. The computations have a simple, highly parallel\nstructure that maps very well onto massively parallel hardware such as\ngraphical processing units (GPUs). Despite being more expensive in pure\ncomputation count, the throughput is comparable to classical W-projection. The\naccuracy is close to classical gridding with a continuous convolution kernel.\nCompared to gridding methods that use a sampled convolution function, the new\nmethod is more accurate. Hence the new method is at least as fast and accurate\nas classical W-projection, while allowing for the correction for quickly\nvarying direction-dependent effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 14:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}

Three\ndifferent types of monotone waves are studied: (i) stationary\ndiffusion-degenerate fronts, connecting the two stable equilibria of the\nreaction; (ii) traveling diffusion-degenerate fronts connecting zero with the\nunstable equilibrium; and, (iii) non-degenerate fronts. In the first two cases,\nthe degeneracy is responsible of the loss of hyperbolicity of the asymptotic\ncoefficient matrices of the spectral problem at one of the end points,\nprecluding the application of standard techniques to locate the essential\nspectrum. This difficulty is overcome with a suitable partition of the\nspectrum, a generalized convergence of operators technique, the analysis of\nsingular (or Weyl) sequences and the use of energy estimates. The monotonicity\nof the fronts, as well as detailed descriptions of the decay structure of\neigenfunctions on a case by case basis, are key ingredients to show that all\ntraveling fronts under consideration are spectrally stable in a suitably chosen\nexponentially weighted $L^2$ energy space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 14:17:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2022 01:20:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-09"}

SW-CRTs must account for time trends in the\noutcome because of the staggered rollout of the intervention inherent in the\ndesign. Robust inference procedures and non-parametric analysis methods have\nrecently been proposed to handle such trends without requiring strong\nparametric modeling assumptions, but these are less powerful than model-based\napproaches. We propose several novel analysis methods that reduce reliance on\nmodeling assumptions while preserving some of the increased power provided by\nthe use of mixed effects models. In one method, we use the synthetic control\napproach to find the best matching clusters for a given intervention cluster.\nThis approach can improve the power of the analysis but is fully\nnon-parametric. Another method makes use of within-cluster crossover\ninformation to construct an overall estimator. We also consider methods that\ncombine these approaches to further improve power. We test these methods on\nsimulated SW-CRTs and identify settings for which these methods gain robustness\nto model misspecification while retaining some of the power advantages of mixed\neffects models. Finally, we propose avenues for future research on the use of\nthese methods; motivation for such research arises from their flexibility,\nwhich allows the identification of specific causal contrasts of interest, their\nrobustness, and the potential for incorporating covariates to further increase\npower.

The\nreddening corrected fluxes follow a tight correlation with a fixed ratio of\n7.76 for the He II 1640 to 4686 line ratio. Dust attenuation decreases this\nratio. We provide a relation between the stellar E(B-V) and the observed line\nratio for several attenuation laws. Combining this technique with the use of\nthe nebular Balmer decrement allows the determination of the stellar and\nnebular dust attenuation in galaxies and can probe its effects at different\nstellar age and mass regimes, independently of the initial mass function and\nthe star-formation history. We derived the dust reddening from the He II line\nfluxes and compared it to the reddening from the Balmer decrement and from the\nslope of the ultraviolet continuum in two star-forming galaxies. The three\nmethods result in dust attenuations which agree to within the errors. Future\napplication of this technique permits studies of the stellar dust attenuation\ncompared to the nebular attenuation in a representative galaxy sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 14:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

Hence, few\nresearchers have faith in such expert systems.

Quantum measures satisfying a\nreproducing property are described and a class of states, called factorizable\nstates, possessing the Dirac-Feynman `exponential of the action' form are\ncharacterized. Finally, Schwinger's transformation functions are interpreted\nsimilarly as transition amplitudes defined by suitable states. The simple\nexamples of the qubit and the double slit experiment are described in detail,\nillustrating the main aspects of the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 15:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

Measurements\nof this capture reaction, the ${}^{3}\\mathrm{He}$-${}^{4}\\mathrm{He}$\nscattering phase shifts, as well as properties of ${}^{7}\\mathrm{Be}$, have\nbeen used to constrain employed theoretical models. Here we show that much more\ninformation than was previously appreciated can be extracted from\nangle-integrated capture data alone. We use the next-to-leading-order (NLO)\namplitude in an effective field theory (EFT) for the reaction to perform the\nextrapolation. At this order the EFT describes the reaction using an s-wave\nscattering length and effective range, the asymptotic properties of the final\nbound states, and short-distance contributions to the $E1$ capture amplitude.\nWe extract the multi-dimensional posterior of all these parameters via a\nBayesian analysis. We find that properties of the ${}^{7}\\mathrm{Be}$ ground\nand excited states are well constrained. The total $S$ factor $S(0)=\n0.578^{+0.015}_{-0.016}$ keV~b, while the branching ratio for excited- to\nground-state capture at zero energy, $Br(0)=0.406^{+0.013}_{-0.011}$, both at\n68\\% degree of belief. This $S(0)$ is broadly consistent with other recent\nevaluations, including the previously recommended value $S(0)=0.56 \\pm 0.03$ eV\nb, but has a smaller error bar. We also find significant constraints on the\nscattering parameters, and we obtain constraints on the $S(E)$'s angular\ndependence. The path forward seems to lie with better measurements of the\nscattering phase shift and $S(E)$'s angular dependence, together with better\nunderstanding of the asymptotic normalization coefficients of the ${}^7$Be\nbound states' wave functions. Data on these could further reduce $S(0)$'s\nuncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 15:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Our approach improves upon\ntraditional methods for regulation health impact analyses by clarifying the\ncausal identifying assumptions, utilizing population-level data, minimizing\nparametric assumptions, and considering the impacts of multiple pollutants\nsimultaneously. To reduce model-dependence, the TEA estimate captures health\nimpacts only for units in the data whose anticipated no-regulation features are\nwithin the support of the observed with-regulation data, thereby providing a\nconservative but data-driven assessment to complement traditional parametric\napproaches. We apply these methods to investigate the health impacts of the\n1990 Clean Air Act Amendments in the US Medicare population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Sep 2019 20:40:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-23"}

Despite available technologies,\nthe automatic generation of clinically acceptable, ready-to-use preoperative\nplanning solutions is currently not possible for such pathologies. Multiple\ncontradicting and mutually dependent objectives have to be considered, as well\nas clinical and technical constraints, generally requiring iterative manual\nadjustments. This leads to unnecessary efforts and unbearable clinical costs,\nhindering also the quality of patient treatment. In this paper, we propose an\noptimization framework for the generation of ready-to-use preoperative planning\nsolutions in a fully automatic fashion. An automatic diagnostic assessment\nusing patient-specific 3D models is performed for 3D malunion quantification\nand definition of the optimization parameters. Afterward, clinical objectives\nare translated into the optimization module, and controlled through tailored\nfitness functions based on a weighted and multi-staged optimization approach.\nThe optimization is based on a genetic algorithm capable of solving\nmulti-objective optimization problems with non-linear constraints. The\nframework outputs a complete preoperative planning solution including position\nand orientation of the osteotomy plane, transformation to achieve the bone\nreduction, and position and orientation of the fixation plate and screws. A\nqualitative validation was performed on 36 consecutive cases of radius\nosteotomy where solutions generated by the optimization algorithm (OA) were\ncompared against the gold standard (GS) solutions generated by experienced\nsurgeons. Solutions were blinded and presented to 6 readers, who voted OA\nsolutions to be better in 55% of the time. The quantitative evaluation was\nbased on different error measurements, showing average improvements with\nrespect to the GS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 07:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

Matrix factorization is a\nwell-known and accurate collaborative filtering approach for recommender\nsystem, which suffers from cold-start problem for new users and items. Whenever\na new user participate with the system there is not enough interactions with\nthe system, therefore there are not enough ratings in the user-item matrix to\nlearn the matrix factorization model. Using auxiliary data such as users\ndemographic, ratings and reviews in relevant domains, is an effective solution\nto reduce the new user problem. In this paper, we used data of users from other\ndomains and build a common space to represent the latent factors of users from\ndifferent domains. In this representation we proposed an iterative method which\napplied MAX-VAR generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA) on users\nlatent factors learned from matrix factorization on each domain.

There is clinical evidence supporting\nthat decomposing an X-ray image into different components (e.g., bone, lung and\nsoft tissue) improves diagnostic value. We hereby propose a decomposition\ngenerative adversarial network (DecGAN) to anatomically decompose a CXR image\nbut with unpaired data. We leverage the anatomy knowledge embedded in CT, which\nfeatures a 3D volume with clearly visible anatomies. Our key idea is to embed\nCT priori decomposition knowledge into the latent space of unpaired CXR\nautoencoder.
