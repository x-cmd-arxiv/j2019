Blockchain technology, previously working for the cryptocurrency, has\nrecently applied to build trust and reliability in peer-to-peer networks with\nsimilar topologies of IV data sharing. In this chapter, we present a new\nframework, namely biometric blockchain (BBC), for secure IV data sharing.

Latent factor models have been widely used for\nrecommendation. Most existing latent factor models mainly utilize the\ninteraction information between users and items, although some recently\nextended models utilize some auxiliary information to learn a unified latent\nfactor for users and items. The unified latent factor only represents the\ncharacteristics of users and the properties of items from the aspect of\npurchase history. However, the characteristics of users and the properties of\nitems may stem from different aspects, e.g., the brand-aspect and\ncategory-aspect of items.

For the first time, we observed the formation and evolution of multiple\nsmall plasmoids with bidirectional flows associated with fast reconnection in\n3D breakout current sheets in the solar corona. The first narrow jet was\nlaunched by reconnection at the breakout current sheet originating at the\ndeformed 3D null, without significant flare reconnection or a filament\neruption. In contrast, the second jet and release of cool filament plasma were\ntriggered by explosive breakout reconnection when the leading edge of the\nrising flux rope formed by flare reconnection beneath the filament encountered\nthe preexisting breakout current sheet. These observations solidly support both\nreconnection-driven jet models: the resistive kink for the first jet, and the\nbreakout model for the second explosive jet with a filament eruption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 2019 17:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

The gate and temperature\ndependent WAL reveals that Dyakonov-Perel (DP) mechanism is dominant for spin\nrelaxation and phase relaxation is governed by electron-electron (e-e)\ninteraction. Large phase coherence length near 600nm at T=1K is obtained,\ntogether with gate tunable spin-orbit interaction (SOI).

That\nis, a family of Ps\\\"atze that follow the structure of the fundamental\nSchm\\\"{u}dgen's Psatz, but where instead of SOS polynomials, any class of\npolynomials containing the non-negative constants can be used, such as SONC,\nDSOS/SDSOS, hyperbolic or sums of AM/GM polynomials. Secondly, by considering\nthe simplex as the simple set, we derive a sparse Psatz over general compact\nsets, which does not require any structural assumptions, such as the running\nintersection property. Finally, by considering P\\'olya's Psatz over the\nnon-negative orthant, we derive a new non-SOS Psatz over unbounded sets which\nsatisfy some generic conditions. All these results contribute to and generalize\nrecent related results in the literature regarding the use of non-SOS\npolynomials and sparse NNCs to derive Ps\\\"atze over compact and unbounded sets.\nMoreover, in contrast to most related literature, our approach is based on\nbasic real analysis rather than algebraic geometry tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 2019 22:36:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2020 23:26:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 17:15:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2022 13:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

Simultaneously, it also: a) reduces transients in\nPoint of Common Coupling (PCC) bus voltage, b) reduces rotor speed\noscillations, and c) controls the output power of the wind turbine without\nexceeding its thermal limits. The approach can work without wind speed\nmeasurements. In order to consider the effect of grid variations at the PCC,\nthe affected area in the grid is modeled as a study area (area of interest),\nand remaining area (external area) is modeled as frequency dependent reduced\norder model (FDROM). The reduced order model (ROM) is then used to estimate the\nreference speed.

In order to identify preventive control\nmeasures that avoid such scenarios from manifesting, the power system must be\nmodeled as a constrained dynamical system. For such systems, the interplay of\nfeasibility region (man-made limits) and stability region (natural dynamical\nsystem response) results in a positively invariant region in state space known\nas the constrained stability region (CSR). After the occurrence of a\ndisturbance, as it is desirable for the system trajectory to lie within the\nCSR, critical clearing time (CCT) must be defined with respect to the CSR\ninstead of the stability region as is done traditionally. The sensitivity of\nCCT to system parameters of constrained systems then becomes beneficial for\nplanning/revising protection settings (which impact feasible region) and/or\noperation (which impact dynamics).

A remarkable existing algorithm to solve this problem is\nthe alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), in which at every\niteration every node updates its local variable through combining neighboring\nvariables and solving an optimization subproblem. The proposed algorithm,\ncalled as COmmunication-censored Linearized ADMM (COLA), leverages a\nlinearization technique to reduce the iteration-wise computation cost of ADMM\nand uses a communication-censoring strategy to alleviate the communication\ncost. To be specific, COLA introduces successive linearization approximations\nto the local cost functions such that the resultant computation is first-order\nand light-weight. Since the linearization technique slows down the convergence\nspeed, COLA further adopts the communication-censoring strategy to avoid\ntransmissions of less informative messages.

In particular, we first propose a subarray-based system\narchitecture for extra-large scale massive MIMO systems. Then, tight\nclosed-form uplink spectral efficiency (SE) approximations with linear\nreceivers are derived. With the objective of maximizing the achievable SE, we\nalso propose schemes for the subarray phase coefficient design. In addition,\nbased on the obtained ergodic achievable SE approximations, two statistical\nchannel state information (CSI)-based greedy user scheduling algorithms are\ndeveloped. Our results indicate that the statistical CSI-based greedy joint\nuser and subarray scheduling algorithm collaborating with the on-off\nswitch-based subarray architecture is a promising practical solution for\nextra-large scale massive MIMO systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Sep 2019 08:28:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 03:24:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

We adapt the\nrecent idea of Image Quality Transfer (IQT) to enhance very low-field\nstructural images aiming to estimate the resolution, spatial coverage, and\ncontrast of high-field images. Analogous to many learning-based image\nenhancement techniques, IQT generates training data from high-field scans alone\nby simulating low-field images through a pre-defined decimation model. However,\nthe ground truth decimation model is not well-known in practice, and lack of\nits specification can bias the trained model, aggravating performance on the\nreal low-field scans. In this paper we propose a probabilistic decimation\nsimulator to improve robustness of model training. It is used to generate and\naugment various low-field images whose parameters are random variables and\nsampled from an empirical distribution related to tissue-specific SNR on a\n0.36T scanner. The probabilistic decimation simulator is model-agnostic, that\nis, it can be used with any super-resolution networks. Furthermore we propose a\nvariant of U-Net architecture to improve its learning performance.

In\nthis paper, we address these two stages of introducing the right entities at\nseemingly reasonable junctures and also referring them coherently in the\ncontext of visual storytelling.

This desirable goal is the main focus of\nour field of interest, state representation learning (SRL). Indeed, a compact\nrepresentation of such a state is beneficial to help robots grasp onto their\nenvironment for interacting. The properties of this representation have a\nstrong impact on the adaptive capability of the agent. In this article we\npresent an approach based on imitation learning. The idea is to train several\npolicies that share the same representation to reproduce various\ndemonstrations. To do so, we use a multi-head neural network with a shared\nstate representation feeding a task-specific agent. If the demonstrations are\ndiverse, the trained representation will eventually contain the information\nnecessary for all tasks, while discarding irrelevant information. As such, it\nwill potentially become a compact state representation useful for new tasks. We\ncall this approach SRLfD (State Representation Learning from Demonstration).\nOur experiments confirm that when a controller takes SRLfD-based\nrepresentations as input, it can achieve better performance than with other\nrepresentation strategies and promote more efficient reinforcement learning\n(RL) than with an end-to-end RL strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Sep 2019 14:43:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Sep 2021 16:27:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

In this work, we demonstrate\nmicropillared epoxy surfaces are sensitive to single drops of bacterial\nsuspensions. The micropillars can show significant deformations upon\nevaporation, just as capillary action does in soft substrates. The phenomenon\nhas been studied with five bacterial strains S. epidermidis, L. sakei, P.\naeruginosa, E. coli and B. subtilis. The results reveal that only droplets\ncontaining motile microbes with flagella stimulate micropillar bending, which\nleads to significant distortions and pillar aggregations forming dimers,\ntrimers, and higher order clusters. Such deformation is manifested in\ncharacteristic patterns that are left on the microarrayed surface following\nevaporation, and can be easily identified even by the naked eye. Our findings\ncould lay the ground for the design and fabrication of mechanically responsive\nsubstrates, sensitive to specific types of microorganisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 2019 18:40:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

An unexpected result is that around the order and disorder\ntransition points the neighboring spins in a FM (AFM) system are more likely\nlongitudinally antiparallel (parallel) than parallel (antiparallel) to each\nother for S<=3/2 in spite of the FM (AFM) exchange between the spins.
