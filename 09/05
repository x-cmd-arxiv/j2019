The theory is based on an extension of\ndynamic mean-field theory from rate networks to spiking networks, which is\nvalidated via simulations. It accounts for both static variability, e.g. due to\na distributed number of incoming synapses per neuron, and temporal fluctuations\nof the input.

We construct a model that explains the observed\npower-law spectral index in terms of the dynamical balance between particle\nacceleration and escape from main acceleration regions, which are defined based\nupon a threshold for the curvature drift acceleration term.

These flames are affected not only by the RT instability, but also\nby the turbulence it generates. Both processes can increase the flame speed by\nstretching and wrinkling the flame. This makes it hard to choose a subgrid\nmodel for the flame speed in full star Type Ia or Iax simulations. Commonly\nused subgrid models get around this difficulty by assuming that either the RT\ninstability or turbulence is dominant and sets the flame speed. In previous\nwork, we evaluated the physical assumptions and predictive abilities of these\ntwo types of models by analysing a large parameter study of 3D direct numerical\nsimulations of RT unstable flames. Surprisingly, we found that the flame\ndynamics is dominated by the RT instability and that RT unstable flames are\nvery different from turbulent flames. In particular, RT unstable flames are\nthinner rather than thicker when turbulence is strong. In addition, none of the\nturbulent flame speed models adequately predicted the flame speed. We also\nshowed that the RT flame speed model failed when the RT instability was strong,\nsuggesting that geometrical burning effects also influence the flame speed.\nHowever, these results depended on simulations with $Re\\lesssim720$. In this\npaper, we extend the parameter study to higher Reynolds number and show that\nthe basic conclusions of our previous study still hold when the RT-generated\nturbulence is stronger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 16:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-05"}

Across a wide range of climates, the thermodynamic\ncontribution to changes in instantaneous precipitation extremes follows\nnear-surface moisture, and the dynamic contribution is positive and small, but\nsensitive to domain size. The shapes of mass flux profiles associated with\nprecipitation extremes are determined by conditional sampling that favors\nstrong vertical motion at levels where the vertical saturation specific\nhumidity gradient is large, and mass flux profiles collapse to a common shape\nacross climates when plotted in a moisture-based vertical coordinate. The\ncollapse, robust to changes in microphysics and turbulence schemes, implies a\nthermodynamic contribution that scales with near-surface moisture despite\nsubstantial convergence aloft and allows the dynamic contribution to be defined\nby the pressure velocity at a single level. Linking the simplified dynamic mode\nto vertical velocities from entraining plume models reveals that the small\ndynamic mode in channel simulations (<~2 %/K) is caused by opposing\nheight-dependences of vertical velocity and density, together with the\nbuffering influence of cloud-base buoyancies that vary little with surface\ntemperature. These results reinforce an emerging picture of the response of\nextreme tropical precipitation rates to warming: a thermodynamic mode of about\n7 %/K dominates, with a minor contribution from changes in dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 16:59:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 17:59:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 16:29:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 17:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

In particular, we introduce a general method for\ndetermining the minimal number of tests required by a given strategy to achieve\na given precision.

Due to the\ndominant geomagnetic nature of the air-shower radio emission in the traditional\nfrequency band of 30 to 80 MHz, the amplitude and polarization of the radio\nsignal strongly depend on the azimuth and zenith angle of the arrival\ndirection. Thus, the estimation of the efficiency and subsequently of the\naperture of an antenna array is more complex than for particle or\nCherenkov-light detectors.

Typically, random parameters are\ndrawn from an interval which is fixed before or adapted during the learning\nprocess. Due to the different functions of the weights and biases, selecting\nthem both from the same interval is not a good idea. Recently more\nsophisticated methods of random parameters generation have been developed, such\nas the data-driven method proposed in \\cite{Anon19}, where the sigmoids are\nplaced in randomly selected regions of the input space and then their slopes\nare adjusted to the local fluctuations of the target function. In this work, we\npropose an extended version of this method, which constructs iteratively the\nnetwork architecture. This method successively generates new hidden nodes and\naccepts them if the training error decreases significantly. The threshold of\nacceptance is adapted to the current training stage. At the beginning of the\ntraining process only those nodes which lead to the largest error reduction are\naccepted. Then, the threshold is reduced by half to accept those nodes which\nmodel the target function details more accurately. This leads to faster\nconvergence and more compact network architecture, as it includes only\n\"significant\" neurons. Several application examples are given which confirm\nthis thesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 17:38:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 12:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

This is\n56 days before perihelion and at a heliocentric distance of 1.9 AU. We consider\npotential mechanisms of disintegration. Tidal disruption is ruled-out, because\nthe comet has not passed within the Roche sphere of any planet. Impact\ndisruption is implausible, because the comet orbit is highly inclined\n(inclination 105.1 deg) and disruption occurred far above the ecliptic, where\nasteroids are rare. The back-pressure generated by sublimation (0.02 to 0.4\nN/m2) is orders of magnitude smaller than the reported compressive strength (30\nto 150 N/m2) of cometary material and, therefore, is of no importance. The\ndepletion of volatiles by sublimation occurs too slowly to render the nucleus\ninactive on the timescale of infall. However, we find that the e-folding\ntimescale for spin-up of the nucleus by the action of sublimation torques is\nshorter than the infall time, provided the nucleus radius is smaller than 0.4\nkm. Thus, the disintegration of C/2019 J2 is tentatively interpreted as the\nrotational disruption of a sub-kilometer nucleus caused by outgassing torques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 17:44:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

The anomaly pole implies\nthe existence of a gapless Chiral Density Wave (CDW), i.e. an axion-like\nacoustic mode of an irrotational and dissipationless Hamiltonian perfect fluid,\nthat is a correlated fermion/anti-fermion pair excitation of the Fermi-Dirac\nsea. In $D\\!=\\!2$ dimensions the chiral superfluid effective action coincides\nwith that of the Schwinger model as $e\\rightarrow 0$, and the CDW acoustic mode\nis precisely the Schwinger boson. Since this identity holds also at zero chiral\nchemical potential, the Dirac vacuum itself may be viewed as a quantum\nsuperfluid state. The CDW collective boson is a $U(1)$ chiral phase field,\nwhich is gapless as a result of a novel, non-linear realization of Goldstone's\ntheorem, extended to this case of symmetry breaking by an anomaly. A new local\nform of the axial anomaly bosonic effective action in any $D$ even spacetime is\ngiven, consistent with superfluidity, and its quantization is shown to be\nrequired by the anomalous Schwinger terms in fermion current commutators. In\nQED$_4$ this collective Goldstone mode appears as a massless pole in the axial\nanomaly triangle diagram, and is responsible for the macroscopic\nnon-dissipative currents of the Chiral Magnetic and Chiral Separation Effects,\nas well as the Anomalous Hall Effect. In a constant uniform magnetic field an\nexact dimensional reduction from $D\\!=\\!4$ to $D\\!=\\!2$ occurs and the\ncollective $e^+e^-$ CDW chiral pair excitation propagating along the magnetic\nfield direction is a Chiral Magnetic Wave, which acquires a mass gap $M^2\\!=\\!\ne^{3}B/2\\pi^{2}$. Possible realizations and tests of the theory of collective\nbosonic excitations due to the anomaly in Dirac/Weyl materials are briefly\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 17:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 18:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-08"}

Analysis of\n$^{13}$CO line data reveals that these W-R stars have developed gas-deficient\ncavities in addition to molecular shells with expansion velocities of a few km\ns$^{-1}$. The pressure owing to stellar winds primarily drives these expanding\nshells and sweeps up the surrounding matter to distances of a few pc.

This suggests that spacetime, like matter, has microscopic degrees of\nfreedom and its long wavelength limit should be described in thermodynamic\nlanguage and not in a geometric language. Second clue is related to the\nexistence of the cosmological constant. Its understanding from first principles\nwill require the dynamical principles of the theory to be invariant under the\nshift $T^a_b \\to T^a_b + (constant) \\delta^a_b$. This puts strong constraints\non the nature of gravitational dynamics and excludes metric tensor as a\nfundamental dynamical variable. In fact, these two clues are closely related to\neach other.

In disks around Herbig Ae stars the vibrational\nexcitation is low when CO lines come from close to the star, and high when\nlines only probe gas at large radii (more than 5 AU). We aim to find\nexplanations for the observed trends between CO vibrational ratio, emitting\nradii, and NIR excess, and identify their implications in terms of the physical\nand chemical structure of inner disks around Herbig stars. Slab models and full\ndisk thermo chemical models are calculated. Simulated observations from the\nmodels are directly compared to the data. Broad CO lines with low vibrational\nratios are best explained by a warm (400-1300 K) inner disk surface with\ngas-to-dust ratios below 1000; no CO is detected within/at the inner dust rim,\ndue to dissociation at high temperatures. In contrast, explaining the narrow\nlines with high vibrational ratios requires an inner cavity of a least 5 AU in\nboth dust and gas, followed by a cool (100-300 K) molecular gas reservoir with\ngas-to-dust ratios greater than 10000 at the cavity wall. In all cases the CO\ngas must be close to thermalization with the dust. The high gas-to-dust ratios\nneeded to explain high $v2/v1$ in narrow CO lines for a subset of group I disks\ncan naturally be interpreted as due to the dust traps that have been proposed\nto explain millimeter dust cavities.

Previous applications of\nMOB-ML employed Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), which provides good\nprediction accuracy with small training sets; however, the cost of GPR training\nscales cubically with the amount of data and becomes a computational bottleneck\nfor large training sets. In the current work, we address this problem by\nintroducing a clustering/regression/classification implementation of MOB-ML. In\na first step, regression clustering (RC) is used to partition the training data\nto best fit an ensemble of linear regression (LR) models; in a second step,\neach cluster is regressed independently, using either LR or GPR; and in a third\nstep, a random forest classifier (RFC) is trained for the prediction of cluster\nassignments based on MOB feature values. Upon inspection, RC is found to\nrecapitulate chemically intuitive groupings of the frontier molecular orbitals,\nand the combined RC/LR/RFC and RC/GPR/RFC implementations of MOB-ML are found\nto provide good prediction accuracy with greatly reduced wall-clock training\ntimes. For a dataset of thermalized geometries of 7211 organic molecules of up\nto seven heavy atoms, both implementations reach chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol\nerror) with only 300 training molecules, while providing 35000-fold and\n4500-fold reductions in the wall-clock training time, respectively, compared to\nMOB-ML without clustering. The resulting models are also demonstrated to retain\ntransferability for the prediction of large-molecule energies with only\nsmall-molecule training data. Finally, it is shown that capping the number of\ntraining datapoints per cluster leads to further improvements in prediction\naccuracy with negligible increases in wall-clock training time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 18:29:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 14:27:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 17:47:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 18:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-28"}

We adopt a general definition of a moving frame as an\nequivariant map from the space of submanifolds to the group itself and\nintroduce two algorithms, which simplify the construction of such maps. The\nfirst algorithm is applicable when the group factors as a product of two\nsubgroups $G=BA$, allowing us to use moving frames and differential invariants\nfor the groups $A$ and $B$ in order to construct a moving frame and\ndifferential invariants for $G$. This approach produces the relations among the\ninvariants of $G$ and its subgroups. We use the groups of the projective, the\naffine and the Euclidean transformations on the plane to illustrate the\nalgorithm. We also introduce a recursive algorithm, allowing, provided the\ngroup action satisfies certain conditions, to construct differential invariants\norder by order, at each step normalizing more and more of the group parameters,\nat the end obtaining a moving frame for the entire group.

This becomes stricter when it comes to\nmedical datasets which require high-cost and time-consuming annotations.\nFurthermore, medical datasets are usually imbalanced, a condition that often\nhinders classifiers performance. The aim of this paper is to learn the\ndistribution of the minority class to synthesise new samples in order to\nimprove lesion detection in mammography. Deep Convolutional Generative\nAdversarial Networks (DCGANs) can efficiently generate breast masses.

For example,\nprevious work proposed to ask users the exact characteristics of their ideal\nitems before showing results. However, users may not have clear ideas about\nwhat an ideal item looks like, especially when they have not seen any item. So\nit is more feasible to facilitate the conversational search by showing example\nitems and asking for feedback instead. In addition, when the users provide\nnegative feedback for the presented items, it is easier to collect their\ndetailed feedback on certain properties (aspect-value pairs) of the\nnon-relevant items.

In the first part, we present the\ntheoretical model used to study interfacial flows arising in droplet-based\nmicrofluidics, paying attention to three elements commonly present in\napplications: viscoelasticity, electric fields and surfactants. We review both\nclassical and current results about the stability of jets affected by these\nelements. Mechanisms leading to the breakup of jets to produce drops are\nreviewed as well, including some recent advances in this field. We also\nconsider the relatively scarce theoretical studies on the emergence and\nstability of tip streaming flows. In the second part of this review, we focus\non axisymmetric microfluidic configurations which can operate on the dripping\nand jetting modes either in a direct (standard) way or via tip streaming. We\npresent the dimensionless parameters characterizing these configurations, the\nscaling laws which allow predicting the size of the resulting droplets and\nbubbles, as well as those delimiting the parameter windows where tip streaming\ncan be found.

However, diagnostic errors of fractures in pelvic X-rays (PXRs)\nare very common, driving the demand for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)\nsolutions. A major challenge lies in the fact that fractures are localized\npatterns that require localized analyses. Unfortunately, the PXRs residing in\nhospital picture archiving and communication system do not typically specify\nregion of interests. In this paper, we propose a two-stage hip and pelvic\nfracture detection method that executes localized fracture classification using\nweakly supervised ROI mining. The first stage uses a large capacity\nfully-convolutional network, i.e., deep with high levels of abstraction, in a\nmultiple instance learning setting to automatically mine probable true positive\nand definite hard negative ROIs from the whole PXR in the training data. The\nsecond stage trains a smaller capacity model, i.e., shallower and more\ngeneralizable, with the mined ROIs to perform localized analyses to classify\nfractures. During inference, our method detects hip and pelvic fractures in one\npass by chaining the probability outputs of the two stages together. We\nevaluate our method on 4 410 PXRs, reporting an area under the ROC curve value\nof 0.975, the highest among state-of-the-art fracture detection methods.\nMoreover, we show that our two-stage approach can perform comparably to human\nphysicians (even outperforming emergency physicians and surgeons), in a\npreliminary reader study of 23 readers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 20:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-14"}

However, it often requires higher than 2-body\nterms to achieve quantitative accuracy. In this work, we propose the Polarized\nMBE (PolBE) method where each MBE energy contribution is treated as an\nembedding problem. In each energy term, a smaller fragment is embedded into a\nlarger, polarized environment and only a small region is treated at the\nhigh-level of theory using embedded mean-field theory. The role of polarized\nenvironment was found to be crucial in providing quantitative accuracy at the\n2-body level. PolBE accurately predicts non-covalent interaction energies for a\nnumber of systems, including CO$_2$, water, and hydrated ion clusters, with a\nvariety of interaction mechanisms, from weak dispersion to strong\nelectrostatics considered in this work. We further demonstrate that the PolBE\ninteraction energy is predominantly pairwise unlike the usual vacuum MBE which\nrequires higher-order terms to achieve similar accuracy. We numerically show\nthat PolBE often performs better than other widely used embedded MBE methods\nsuch as the electrostatically embedded MBE. Owing to the lack of expensive\ndiagonalization of Fock matrices and its embarrassingly parallel nature, PolBE\nis a promising way to access condensed phase systems with hybrid density\nfunctionals that are difficult to treat with currently available methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 20:56:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 15:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

Noise and spectral stability of\nsuch broadband sources are key parameters that define their true potential and\nsuitability towards real-world applications. In order to investigate the\nspectral stability and noise levels in these fiber-based DUV sources, we\ngenerate an SC spectrum that extends from 180 nm (through phase-matched\ndispersive waves - DWs) to 4 {\\mu}m by pumping an argon-filled hollow-core\nanti-resonant fiber at a wavelength of 2.45 {\\mu}m. We characterize the\nlong-term stability of the source over several days and the pulse-to-pulse\nrelative intensity (RIN) noise of the strongest DW at 275 nm. The results\nindicate no sign of spectral degradation over 110 hours, but the RIN of the DW\npulses at 275 nm is found to be as high as 33.3%. Numerical simulations were\ncarried out to investigate the spectral distribution of the RIN and the results\nconfirm the experimental measurements and that the poor noise performance is\ndue to the RIN of the pump laser, which was hitherto not considered in\nnumerical modelling of these sources. The results presented herein provide an\nimportant step towards an understanding of the noise mechanism underlying such\ncomplex light-gas nonlinear interactions and demonstrate the need for pump\nlaser stabilization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 21:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

The model\nonly allows a small set of $f_{\\nu}$ log slopes in the optical -thereby\nallowing a clear path to verification or falsification. Measurements of prompt\nGRB emission in the optical thus far give no useful information about the\nspectral shape within the band, and therefore cannot be used to evaluate such\npredictions.\n  We describe an experiment that responds to GRB alerts with a fast-slewing\ntelescope, with 3+ simultaneous, high-time resolution cameras.

In this\nself-modulation process, the current spike on the tail of the electron-beam\nradiates coherently at the resonant wavelength of the wiggler, producing a\nsix-period carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) stable infrared field with gigawatt\npower. This field creates a few MeV, phase-stable modulation in the\nelectron-beam core.

Instead of seeking more instance-level labels from human annotators,\nhere we propose to annotate frequent surface patterns to form labeling rules.\nThese rules can be automatically mined from large text corpora and generalized\nvia a soft rule matching mechanism. Prior works use labeling rules in an exact\nmatching fashion, which inherently limits the coverage of sentence matching and\nresults in the low-recall issue. In this paper, we present a neural approach to\nground rules for RE, named NERO, which jointly learns a relation extraction\nmodule and a soft matching module. One can employ any neural relation\nextraction models as the instantiation for the RE module. The soft matching\nmodule learns to match rules with semantically similar sentences such that raw\ncorpora can be automatically labeled and leveraged by the RE module (in a much\nbetter coverage) as augmented supervision, in addition to the exactly matched\nsentences. Extensive experiments and analysis on two public and widely-used\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NERO framework,\ncomparing with both rule-based and semi-supervised methods. Through user\nstudies, we find that the time efficiency for a human to annotate rules and\nsentences are similar (0.30 vs. 0.35 min per label). In particular, NERO's\nperformance using 270 rules is comparable to the models trained using 3,000\nlabeled sentences, yielding a 9.5x speedup. Moreover, NERO can predict for\nunseen relations at test time and provide interpretable predictions.

To this end, our proposed semi-supervised learning method\nassigns pseudo-labels to unpaired samples via Generative Adversarial Networks\nto learn the joint distribution of image and caption. To evaluate, we construct\nscarcely-paired COCO dataset, a modified version of MS COCO caption dataset.\nThe empirical results show the effectiveness of our method compared to several\nstrong baselines, especially when the amount of the paired samples are scarce.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 04:16:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 07:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-22"}

This paper focuses on\nthe efficient representation of tensor network operators with long-range\npairwise interactions such as the Coulomb interaction. For MPOs, we find that\nall existing efficient methods exploit a peculiar \"upper-triangular low-rank\"\n(UTLR) property, i.e. the upper-triangular part of the matrix can be well\napproximated by a low-rank matrix, while the matrix itself can be full-rank.\nThis allows us to convert the problem of finding the efficient MPO\nrepresentation into a matrix completion problem. We develop a modified\nincremental singular value decomposition method (ISVD) to solve this\nill-conditioned matrix completion problem. This algorithm yields equivalent MPO\nrepresentation to that developed in [Stoudenmire and White, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n2017]. In order to efficiently treat more general tensor network operators, we\ndevelop another strategy for compressing tensor network operators based on\nhierarchical low-rank matrix formats, such as the hierarchical off-diagonal\nlow-rank (HODLR) format, and the $\\mathcal{H}$-matrix format. Though the\npre-constant in the complexity is larger, the advantage of using the\nhierarchical low-rank matrix format is that it is applicable to both MPOs and\nPEPOs. For the Coulomb interaction, the operator can be represented by a linear\ncombination of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(N)\\log(N/\\epsilon))$ MPOs/PEPOs, each with a\nconstant bond dimension, where $N$ is the system size and $\\epsilon$ is the\naccuracy of the low-rank truncation.

If one instead allows the scalar product to be positive\nsemi-definite, this opens new possibilities for unification of gauge and\nspacetime symmetries. It follows from theorems on the structure of Lie\nalgebras, that in the case of unified symmetries, the degenerate directions of\nthe positive semi-definite invariant scalar product have to correspond to local\nsymmetries with nilpotent generators. In this paper we construct a workable\nminimal toy model making use of this mechanism: it admits unified local\nsymmetries having a compact -- U(1) -- component, a Lorentz -- SL(2,C) --\ncomponent, and a nilpotent component gluing these together. The construction is\nsuch that the full unified symmetry group acts locally and faithfully on the\nmatter field sector, whereas the gauge fields which would correspond to the\nnilpotent generators can be transformed out from the theory, leaving gauge\nfields only with compact charges. It is shown that already the ordinary Dirac\nequation admits an extremely simple prototype example for the above gauge field\nelimination mechanism: it has a local symmetry with corresponding eliminable\ngauge field, related to the dilatation group. The outlined symmetry unification\nmechanism can be used to by-pass the Coleman--Mandula and related no-go\ntheorems in a way that is fundamentally different from supersymmetry. In\nparticular, the mechanism avoids invocation of super-coordinates or extra\ndimensions for the underlying spacetime manifold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 04:45:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 15:53:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 14:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

Both methods\nsuffer from limitations: the shared hidden layers of the former are difficult\nto optimize due to the competing objectives while the complexity of the latter\ngrows linearly with the increasing number of tasks. To mitigate those\ndrawbacks, this paper proposes an alternative, where we explicitly construct an\nauxiliary module to mimic the soft parameter sharing for assisting the\noptimization of the hard parameter sharing layers in the training phase. In\nparticular, the auxiliary module takes the outputs of the shared hidden layers\nas inputs and is supervised by the auxiliary task loss. During training, the\nauxiliary module is jointly optimized with the MTL network, serving as a\nregularization by introducing an inductive bias to the shared layers. In the\ntesting phase, only the original MTL network is kept. Thus our method avoids\nthe limitation of both categories.

The main idea\nof the attention models is to locate on the most informative parts of the\nvisual data. The attention mechanisms are quite popular these days. However,\nmost existing visual attention mechanisms regard the question as a whole. They\nignore the word-level semantics where each word can have different attentions\nand some words need no attention. Neither do they consider the semantic\nstructure of the sentences. Although the Extended Soft Attention (E-SA) model\nfor video question answering leverages the word-level attention, it performs\npoorly on long question sentences. In this paper, we propose the heterogeneous\ntree-structured memory network (HTreeMN) for video question answering. Our\nproposed approach is based upon the syntax parse trees of the question\nsentences. The HTreeMN treats the words differently where the \\textit{visual}\nwords are processed with an attention module and the \\textit{verbal} ones not.\nIt also utilizes the semantic structure of the sentences by combining the\nneighbors based on the recursive structure of the parse trees. The\nunderstandings of the words and the videos are propagated and merged from\nleaves to the root. Furthermore, we build a hierarchical attention mechanism to\ndistill the attended features. We evaluate our approach on two datasets. The\nexperimental results show the superiority of our HTreeMN model over the other\nattention models especially on complex questions.

In this paper, we propose a practical object detection method\nwith scale-sensitive network.Our method first predicts a global continuous\nscale ,which is shared by all position, for each convolution filter of each\nnetwork stage. To effectively learn the scale, we average the spatial features\nand distill the scale from channels.

To analyze this perturbation energy,\nthis paper proposes a novel physically motivated Lyapunov modal analysis (LMA)\nframework, which combines selective modal analysis with the spectral\ndecompositions of specially chosen Lyapunov functions. This approach allows the\nmodal interactions in dynamical systems to be characterized and estimated in\nconnection with specific state variables. Conventional participation factors\ncharacterize the relative contribution of the system modes and state variables\nto the evolution of states and modes, respectively. In contrast, the proposed\nLyapunov participation factors characterize similar contributions to\ncorresponding Lyapunov functions, which determine the integral energy\nassociated with the states and modes on an infinite or finite time interval.\nThis allows the estimation of modal interactions in terms of total energy\nproduced by their mutual actions over time. Using a two-area four-machines\npower system, we demonstrate that LMA reliably identifies resonant modal\ninteractions, merging of modes, and loss of stability, even for a linear model,\nand associates them with certain state variables. The Lyapunov participation\nfactors corresponding to the selected part of the system spectrum can be\ncalculated independently and serve as a basis for rapid real-time calculations\nof critical mode behaviors in large-scale dynamical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 06:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-06"}

However, the datasets\nfrom source domain are simply discarded in the fine-tuning process. We argue\nthat the source datasets could be better utilized and benefit fine-tuning. This\npaper firstly introduces the concept of general discrimination to describe\nability of a network to distinguish untrained patterns, and then experimentally\ndemonstrates that general discrimination could potentially enhance the total\ndiscrimination ability on target domain. Furthermore, we propose a novel and\nlight-weighted method, namely soft fine-tuning. Unlike traditional fine-tuning\nwhich directly replaces optimization objective by a loss function on the target\ndomain, soft fine-tuning effectively keeps general discrimination by holding\nthe previous loss and removes it softly. By doing so, soft fine-tuning improves\nthe robustness of the network to data bias, and meanwhile accelerates the\nconvergence. We evaluate our approach on several visual recognition tasks.\nExtensive experimental results support that soft fine-tuning provides\nconsistent improvement on all evaluated tasks, and outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art significantly.

However, only if entanglement is allowed in the\nreservoir qubit can we stabilise the oscillator at a wider set of squeezed\nstates. This thus provides a proof for the necessity of involving entanglement\nin the reservoir qubits input to the oscillator, as regard to the stabilisation\nof quantum states in the proposed system setting. On the other hand, this\nsystem setup can be in turn used to estimate the coupling strength between the\noscillator and reservoir qubits.

Early observations revealed that the\nsource's radio emission is brighter than that of any other known neutron star\nlow-mass X-ray binary (NS-LMXB) at comparable X-ray luminosity, and assuming\nits likely $\\gtrsim 6$ kpc distance. It is comparably radio bright to black\nhole LMXBs at similar X-ray luminosities. In this work, we present the results\nof our extensive radio and X-ray monitoring campaign of the 2018 outburst of\nIGR J17591$-$2342. In total we collected 10 quasi-simultaneous radio (VLA,\nATCA) and X-ray (Swift-XRT) observations, which make IGR J17591$-$2342 one of\nthe best-sampled NS-LMXBs. We use these to fit a power-law correlation index\n$\\beta = 0.37^{+0.42}_{-0.40}$ between observed radio and X-ray luminosities (\n$L_\\mathrm{R}\\propto L_\\mathrm{X}^{\\beta}$). However, our monitoring revealed a\nlarge scatter in IGR J17591$-$2342's radio luminosity (at a similar X-ray\nluminosity, $L_\\mathrm{X} \\sim 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and spectral state), with\n$L_\\mathrm{R} \\sim 4 \\times 10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ during the first three\nreported observations, and up to a factor of 4 lower $L_\\mathrm{R}$ during\nlater radio observations. Nonetheless, the average radio luminosity of IGR\nJ17591$-$2342 is still one of the highest among NS-LMXBs, and we discuss\npossible reasons for the wide range of radio luminosities observed in such\nsystems during outburst. We found no evidence for radio pulsations from IGR\nJ17591$-$2342 in our Green Bank Telescope observations performed shortly after\nthe source returned to quiescence. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out that IGR\nJ17591$-$2342 becomes a radio millisecond pulsar during quiescence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 11:12:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 18:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Deep Subaru and Hubble Space Telescope photometry\ndemonstrates that their stellar populations are old, and that the star\nformation activity did not last longer than 2 Gyr in these systems. A few\nmechanisms that may lead to such a rapid quenching have been investigated by\nmeans of hydrodynamic simulations, without providing any final assessment so\nfar. This is the first in a series of papers aimed at analysing the roles of\nstellar feedback, ram pressure stripping, host-satellite tidal interactions and\nreionization in cleaning the lowest-mass Milky Way companions of their cold\ngas, by using high-resolution, three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We\nsimulate an isolated ultrafaint dwarf galaxy loosely modeled after Bootes I,\nand examine whether or not stellar feedback alone could drive a substantial\nfraction of the ambient gas out from the shallow potential well. In contrast to\nsimple analytical estimates, but in agreement with previous hydrodynamical\nstudies, we find that most of the cold gas reservoir is retained. Conversely, a\nsignificant fraction of the metal-enriched stellar ejecta crosses the\nboundaries of the computational box with velocities exceeding the local escape\nvelocity and is, thus, likely lost from the system. Although the total energy\noutput from multiple supernova explosions exceeds the binding energy of the\ngas, no galactic-scale outflow develops in our simulations and as such, most of\nthe ambient medium remains trapped within the weak potential well of the model\ngalaxy. It seems thus unavoidable that, in order to explain the dearth of gas\nin ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, we will have to resort to environmental effects.\nThis will be the subject of a forthcoming paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 11:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

The results suggest that\nstar formation at early evolutionary phases in the CMZ is about 10 times less\nefficient than expected by the dense gas star formation relation, which is in\nline with previous studies that focus on more evolved phases of star formation.\nThis means that if there will be any impending, next burst of star formation in\nthe CMZ, it has not yet begun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 11:49:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

Then, the Principal\nComponent Spatial Characteristic (PCSC) is designed to measure the\nspatial-dimensional quality of LFI considering its global naturalness and local\nfrequency properties. Finally, the Tensor Angular Variation Index (TAVI) is\nproposed to measure angular consistency quality by analyzing the structural\nsimilarity distribution between the first principal component and each view in\nthe view stack.

In most of the education systems, developing reading comprehension\nability is compulsory in the curriculum from year one to year 12. It is an\nindispensable ability in the dissemination of knowledge. With the emerging\nartificial intelligence, computers start to be able to read and understand like\npeople in some context. They can even read better than human beings for some\ntasks, but have little clue in other tasks. It will be very beneficial if we\ncan identify the levels of machine comprehension ability, which will direct us\non the further improvement. Turing test is a well-known test of the difference\nbetween computer intelligence and human intelligence. In order to be able to\ncompare the difference between people reading and machines reading, we proposed\na test called (reading) Comprehension Ability Test (CAT).CAT is similar to\nTuring test, passing of which means we cannot differentiate people from\nalgorithms in term of their comprehension ability.

A simplified dynamic equation, sometimes called the thermal wind or\nthermo-gravitational wind equation, establishes a link between zonal flows and\nthe related buoyancy perturbation, which in turn can be exploited to yield the\ndynamic gravity perturbation. Whether or not the action of the dynamic gravity\nperturbation needs to be explicitly included in this equation, an effect we\ncall the Dynamic Self Gravity (DSG), has been a matter of intense debate. We\nshow that, under reasonable assumptions, the equation can be solved (semi)\nanalytically. This allows us to quantify the impact of the DSG on each gravity\nharmonic, practically independent of the zonal flow or the details of the\nplanetary interior model. The impact decreases with growing spherical harmonic\ndegree l. For degrees l=2 to about l=4, the DSG is a first order effect and\nshould be taken into account in any attempt of inverting gravity measurements\nfor zonal flow properties. For degrees of about l=5 to roughly l=10, the\nrelative impact of DSG is about 10% and thus seems worthwhile to include, in\nparticular since this comes at little extra costs with the method presented\nhere. For yet higher degrees, is seems questionable whether gravity\nmeasurements or interior models will ever reach the required precision\nequivalent of the DSG impact of only a few percent of less.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 13:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

We use\nLOFAR to image the long-wavelength radio emission of the high-redshift blazar\nS5 0836+710 on arcsecond scales between 120 MHz and 160 MHz. The LOFAR image\nshows a compact unresolved core and a resolved emission region about 1.5 arcsec\nto the southwest of the radio core. This structure is in general agreement with\nprevious higher-frequency radio observations with MERLIN and the VLA. The\nsouthern component shows a moderately steep spectrum with a spectral index of\nabout $\\gtrsim -1$ while the spectral index of the core is flat to slightly\ninverted. In addition, we detect for the first time a resolved steep-spectrum\nhalo with a spectral index of about $-1$ surrounding the core. The\narcsecond-scale radio structure of S5 0836+710 can be understood as an FR\nII-like radio galaxy observed at a small viewing angle. The southern component\ncan be interpreted as the region of the approaching jet's terminal hotspot and\nthe halo-like diffuse component near the core can be interpreted as the\ncounter-hotspot region. From the differential Doppler boosting of both\nfeatures, we can derive the hotspot advance speed to $(0.01-0.036)$ c. At a\nconstant advance speed, the derived age of the source would exceed the total\nlifetime of such a powerful FR II-like radio galaxy substantially. Thus, the\nhotspot advance speed must have been higher in the past in agreement with a\nscenario in which the originally highly relativistic jet has lost collimation\ndue to the growth of instabilities and has transformed into an only mildly\nrelativistic flow. Our data suggest that the density of the intergalactic\nmedium around this distant ($z=2.22$) AGN could be substantially higher than\nthe values typically found in less distant FR II radio galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 13:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

A search for $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ in the\nsolar neutrino flux is also presented: the presence of $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ would be a\nmanifestation of a non-zero anomalous magnetic moment of the neutrino, making\npossible its conversion to antineutrinos in the strong magnetic field of the\nSun. We obtain a limit for a solar $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ flux of 384 cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$\n(90% C.L.), assuming an undistorted solar $^{8}$B neutrinos energy spectrum,\nthat corresponds to a transition probability $p_{ \\nu_e \\rightarrow\n\\bar\\nu_{e}}<$ 7.2$\\times$10$^{-5}$ (90% C.L.) for E$_{\\bar {\\nu}_e}$ $>$ 1.8\nMeV. At lower energies, by investigating the spectral shape of elastic\nscattering events, we obtain a new limit on solar $^{7}$Be-$\\nu_e$ conversion\ninto $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ of $p_{ \\nu_e \\rightarrow \\bar \\nu_{e}}<$ 0.14 (90% C.L.) at\n0.862 keV. Last, we investigate solar flares as possible neutrino sources and\nobtain the strongest up-to-date limits on the fluence of neutrinos of all\nflavor neutrino below 3-7 ,MeV. Assuming the neutrino flux to be proportional\nto the flare's intensity, we exclude an intense solar flare as the cause of the\nobserved excess of events in run 117 of the Cl-Ar Homestake experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 13:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-06"}

Consequently, most viewers need to be re-immersed in the story\nbefore watching a new season. Although discussions with friends and family can\nhelp, we observe that most viewers make extensive use of summaries to re-engage\nwith the plot. Automatic generation of video summaries of TV series' complex\nstories requires, first, modeling the dynamics of the plot and, second,\nextracting relevant sequences. In this paper, we tackle plot modeling by\nconsidering the social network of interactions between the characters involved\nin the narrative: substantial, durable changes in a major character's social\nenvironment suggest a new development relevant for the summary. Once\nidentified, these major stages in each character's storyline can be used as a\nbasis for completing the summary with related sequences. Our algorithm combines\nsuch social network analysis with filmmaking grammar to automatically generate\ncharacter-oriented video summaries of TV series from partially annotated data.\nWe carry out evaluation with a user study in a real-world scenario: a large\nsample of viewers were asked to rank video summaries centered on five\ncharacters of the popular TV series Game of Thrones, a few weeks before the\nnew, sixth season was released. Our results reveal the ability of\ncharacter-oriented summaries to re-engage viewers in television series and\nconfirm the contributions of modeling the plot content and exploiting stylistic\npatterns to identify salient sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 14:00:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 15:24:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 07:10:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-19"}

AM of ceramic components using PDCs has been\ndemonstrated with a number of high-cost techniques, but data is lacking for\nfused filament fabrication (FFF)-based 3-D printing. This study investigates\nthe potential to use the lower-cost, more widespread and accessible FFF-based\n3-D printing of PDCs. Low-cost FFF machines have a resolution limit set by the\nnozzle width, which is inferior to the resolutions obtained with expensive SLA\nor SLS AM systems. To match the performance a partial PDC conversion is used\nhere, where only the outer surface of the printed polymer frame is converted to\nceramic. Here the FFF-based 3-D printed sample is coated with a preceramic\npolymer and then it is converted into the corresponding PDC sample with a high\ntemperature pyrolysis process. A screening experiment is performed on\ncommercial filaments to obtain ceramic 3-D prints by surface coating both hard\nthermoplastics: poly lactic acid (PLA), polycarbonate (PC), nylon alloys,\npolypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG), polyethylene\nterephthalate (PET), and co-polyesters; and flexible materials including:\nflexible PLA, thermoplastic elastomer and thermoplastic polyurethane filaments.\nMass and volume changes were quantified for the soaking and pyrolysis steps to\nform a hollow ceramic skin.

Existing\nprogramming models for quantum computing were designed with fault-tolerant\nhardware in mind, envisioning standalone applications. However, near-term\nquantum computers are susceptible to noise which limits their standalone\nutility. To better leverage limited computational strengths of noisy quantum\ndevices, hybrid algorithms have been suggested whereby quantum computers are\nused in tandem with their classical counterparts in a heterogeneous fashion.\nThis {\\it modus operandi} calls out for a programming model and a high-level\nprogramming language that natively and seamlessly supports heterogeneous\nquantum-classical hardware architectures in a single-source-code paradigm.\nMotivated by the lack of such a model, we introduce a language extension\nspecification, called QCOR, that enables single-source quantum-classical\nprogramming. Programs written using the QCOR library and directives based\nlanguage extensions can be compiled to produce functional hybrid binary\nexecutables. After defining the QCOR's programming model, memory model, and\nexecution model, we discuss how QCOR enables variational, iterative, and feed\nforward quantum computing. QCOR approaches quantum-classical computation in a\nhardware-agnostic heterogeneous fashion and strives to build on best practices\nof high performance computing (HPC). The high level of abstraction in the\ndeveloped language is intended to accelerate the adoption of quantum computing\nby researchers familiar with classical HPC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 14:43:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-06"}

The model is relevant to organic\ncrystals, transition metal oxides, or ultracold atoms in optical lattices. We\nimplement numerical pump-probe measurements to calculate time-dependent\nconductivity and single-particle spectral functions. In general, short optical\nexcitation induces a metallic behavior imprinted as a Drude peak in\nconductivity or an in-gap density of states. In a Mott insulator, we find that\nthe induced Drude peak oscillates at the pump frequency and its second\nharmonic. The former comes from the oscillation of currents, and the latter\nfrom the interference of single- and three-photon excited states. In a band\ninsulator, the Drude peak oscillates only at the pump frequency, and quantities\nsuch as the double occupancy do not oscillate. The absence of the second\nharmonic oscillation is due to the degeneracy of multi-photon excited states.\nThe in-gap density of states in both insulators correlates with the Drude\nweight and the energy absorption for weak pumping. Strong pumping leads to\nsaturation of the in-gap density of states and to suppression of the Drude\nweight in the Mott regime.

Previous work on the\ncase of a single noisy measurement vector has exposed two main challenges: 1) a\nhigh requirement concerning the \\emph{signal-to-noise ratio} ($\\snr$), i.e.,\napproximately of the order of $n^{5}$, and 2) a massive computational burden in\nlight of NP-hardness in general.\n  In this paper, we study the case of \\emph{multiple} noisy measurement vectors\n(MMVs) resulting from a \\emph{common} permutation and investigate to what\nextent the number of MMVs $m$ facilitates permutation recovery by \"borrowing\nstrength\". The above two challenges have at least partially been resolved\nwithin our work. First, we show that a large stable rank of the signal\nsignificantly reduces the required snr which can drop from a polynomial in $n$\nfor $m = 1$ to a constant for $m = \\Omega(\\log n)$, where $m$ denotes the\nnumber of MMVs and $n$ denotes the number of measurements per MV.

For the case in which both the signal and permutation\nare unknown, the problem is reformulated as a bi-convex optimization problem\nwith an auxiliary variable, which can be solved by the Alternating Direction\nMethod of Multipliers (ADMM).

What is the causal effect of brevity on message success? What are the\nlinguistic traits of brevity? When is brevity beneficial, and when is it not?\nWhereas most prior work has studied the effect of wording on style and success\nin observational setups, we conduct a controlled experiment, in which crowd\nworkers shorten social media posts to prescribed target lengths and other crowd\nworkers subsequently rate the original and shortened versions. This allows us\nto isolate the causal effect of brevity on the success of a message. We find\nthat concise messages are on average more successful than the original messages\nup to a length reduction of 30-40%. The optimal reduction is on average between\n10% and 20%.

In referring expressions, people usually describe a target entity in\nterms of its relationship with other contextual entities as well as visual\nattributes. However, previous weakly supervised REG methods rarely pay\nattention to the relationship between the entities. In this paper, we propose a\nknowledge-guided pairwise reconstruction network (KPRN), which models the\nrelationship between the target entity (subject) and contextual entity (object)\nas well as grounds these two entities. Specifically, we first design a\nknowledge extraction module to guide the proposal selection of subject and\nobject.

Their classical nonlinear dynamics is\nsurprisingly rich and so far remains underexplored. Works devoted to this\nsubject have typically focussed on dissipation constants which are\nsubstantially larger than those encountered in current experiments, such that\nthe nonlinear dynamics of weakly dissipative optomechanical systems is almost\nuncharted waters. In this work, we fill this gap and investigate the regular\nand chaotic dynamics in this important regime. To analyze the dynamical\nattractors, we have extended the \"Generalized Alignment Index\" method to\ndissipative systems. We show that, even when chaotic motion is absent, the\ndynamics in the weakly dissipative regime is extremely sensitive to initial\nconditions. We argue that reducing dissipation allows chaotic dynamics to\nappear at a substantially smaller driving strength and enables various routes\nto chaos. We identify three generic features in weakly dissipative classical\noptomechanical nonlinear dynamics: the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation between limit\ncycles and limit tori (leading to a comb of sidebands in the spectrum), the\nquasiperiodic route to chaos, and the existence of transient chaos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 07:52:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 11:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

Passive galaxies were selected on the basis of their\nNUVrK colors (~900 objects), and the environment was defined as the galaxy\ndensity contrast, delta, using the fifth nearest-neighbor approach. The\nanalysis of Sigma vs. delta was carried out in two stellar mass bins. In\ngalaxies with Mstar<2*10^11 Msun, no correlation between Sigma and delta is\nobserved. This implies that the accretion of satellite galaxies, which is more\nfrequent in denser environments and efficient in reducing the galaxy Sigma, is\nnot relevant in the formation and evolution of these systems. Conversely, in\ngalaxies with Mstar>2*10^11 Msun, we find an excess of MPGs with low Sigma and\na deficit of high-Sigma MPGs in the densest regions wrt other environments. We\ninterpret this result as due to the migration of some high-Sigma MPGs (<1% of\nthe total population of MPGs) into low-Sigma MPGs, probably through mergers or\ncannibalism of small satellites. In summary, our results imply that the\naccretion of satellite galaxies has a marginal role in the mass-assembly\nhistory of most MPGs.\n  We have previously found that the number density of VIPERS massive\nstar-forming galaxies (MSFGs) declines rapidily from z=0.8 to z=0.5, which\nmirrors the rapid increase in the number density of MPGs. This indicates that\nthe MSFGs at z>0.8 migrate to the MPG population. Here, we investigate the\nSigma-delta relation of MSFGs at z>0.8 and find that it is consistent within 1\nsigma with that of low-Sigma MPGs at z<0.8. Thus, the results of this and our\nprevious paper show that MSFGs at z>0.8 are consistent in terms of number and\nenvironment with being the progenitors of low-Sigma MPGs at z<0.8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 14:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

To alleviate this problem, we\nexplicitly separate the modeling process of semantic and structural\ninformation. Intuitively, humans generate structured sentences by directly\nconnecting discourses with discourse markers (such as and, but, etc.).\nTherefore, we propose a task that mimics this process, called discourse\ntransfer. This task represents a structured sentence as (head discourse,\ndiscourse marker, tail discourse), and aims at tail discourse generation based\non head discourse and discourse marker. We also propose a corresponding model\ncalled TransSent, which interprets the relationship between two discourses as a\ntranslation1 from the head discourse to the tail discourse in the embedding\nspace.

This creates a new problem: to find explicit\nformulas for the structure constants in this new basis. These are well known in\nthe 2D case, and recently expressions were found for the 3D case by ad hoc\nmethods. The goal of the present paper is to formulate a systematic approach to\nthis calculation.\n  We propose to do this using a rational method for the inversion of the\nClebsch-Gordan coefficients. We illustrate the method on a family of 3D vector\nfields and compute the unique formal normal form for the Euler family both in\nthe 2D and 3D case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 23:03:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 21:16:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-30"}

Visible optics and\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer complementary advantages of resolution,\nspeed and depth of penetration, and as such would be attractive in combination.\nIn this paper, we take first steps towards marrying together optical and MR\nimaging in a class of biocompatible particulate materials constructed out of\ndiamond. The particles are endowed with a high density of quantum defects\n(Nitrogen Vacancy centers) that under optical excitation fluoresce brightly in\nthe visible, but also concurrently electron spin polarize. This allows the\nhyperpolarization of lattice 13C nuclei to make the particles over three-orders\nof magnitude brighter than in conventional MRI. Dual-mode optical and MR\nimaging permits immediate access to improvements in resolution and\nsignal-to-noise especially in scattering environments. We highlight additional\nbenefits in background-free imaging, demonstrating lock-in suppression by\nfactors of 2 and 5 in optical and MR domains respectively. Ultimate limits\ncould approach as much as two orders of magnitude in each domain. Finally,\nleveraging the ability of optical and MR imaging to simultaneously probe\nFourier-reciprocal domains (real and k-space), we elucidate the ability to\nemploy hybrid sub-sampling in both conjugate spaces to vastly accelerate\ndual-image acquisition, by as much as two orders of magnitude in practically\nrelevant sparse-imaging scenarios. This is accompanied by a reduction in\noptical power by the same factor. Our work suggests interesting possibilities\nfor the simultaneous optical and low-field MR imaging of targeted diamond\nnanoparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 20:06:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2020 19:45:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2021 07:03:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

Based on the definition\nof wholeness, a mathematical model of wholeness, together with its topological\nrepresentation, has been developed, and it is able to address not only why a\nstructure is beautiful, but also how much beauty the structure has. Given the\ncircumstance, this paper is attempted to argue for the wholeness as the\nscientific foundation of sustainable urban design and planning, with the help\nof the mathematical model and topological representation. We start by\nintroducing the wholeness as a mathematical structure of physical space that\npervasively exists in our surroundings, along with two fundamental laws -\nscaling law and Tobler's law - that underlie the 15 properties for\ncharacterizing and making living structures. We argue that urban design and\nplanning can be considered to be wholeness-extending processes, guided by two\ndesign principles of differentiation and adaptation, to transform a space - in\na piecemeal fashion - into a living or more living structure. We further\ndiscuss several other urban design theories and how they can be justified by\nand placed within the theory of wholeness. With the wholeness as the scientific\nfoundation, urban design can turn into a rigorous science with creation of\nliving structures as the primary aim.\n  Keywords: Beauty, life, scaling law, adaptation, differentiation, and organic\nworld view\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 19:32:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-04"}
