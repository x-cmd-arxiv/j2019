We used constraints from limb\nspectra between 50 and 900 cm$^{-1}$ and from in situ measurements by the\nHuygens probe to characterize the temperature, haze and gaseous absorber\nprofiles. We confirm that the N$_2$-CH$_4$ collision-induced absorption (CIA)\ncoefficients used up to now need to be increased by about 52% at temperatures\nof 70-85 K. We find that the N$_2$-N$_2$ CIA coefficients are also too low in\nthe N$_2$ band far wing, beyond 110 cm$^{-1}$, in agreement with recent quantum\nmechanical calculations.

On the other hand, magnetic interaction of H$_2$ with CH$_4$,\nand to a lesser extent N$_2$, can operate on a timescale similar to the\nvertical mixing time in the troposphere. This process is thus likely\nresponsible for the o-p equilibration of H$_2$ in the mid-troposphere implied\nby CIRS measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 16:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

Although low-mass stars are magnetically active objects, the question\nof how the star's magnetic field impacts large-scale tidal flows and the\nexcitation, propagation and dissipation of tidal waves still remains open. Our\ngoal is to investigate the impact of stellar magnetism on the forcing of tidal\nwaves, and their propagation and dissipation in the convective envelope of\nlow-mass stars as they evolve. We have estimated the amplitude of the magnetic\ncontribution to the forcing and dissipation of tidally induced magneto-inertial\nwaves throughout the structural and rotational evolution of low-mass stars\n(from M to F-type). For this purpose, we have used detailed grids of rotating\nstellar models computed with the stellar evolution code STAREVOL. The amplitude\nof dynamo-generated magnetic fields is estimated via physical scaling laws at\nthe base and the top of the convective envelope. We find that the large-scale\nmagnetic field of the star has little influence on the excitation of tidal\nwaves in the case of nearly-circular orbits and coplanar hot-Jupiter planetary\nsystems, but that it has a major impact on the way waves are dissipated. Our\nresults therefore indicate that a full magneto-hydrodynamical treatment of the\npropagation and dissipation of tidal waves is needed to properly assess the\nimpact of star-planet tidal interactions throughout the evolutionary history of\nlow-mass stars hosting short-period massive planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 17:17:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

The simplest step\ntowards that goal is a better understanding of nonequilibrium steady-states\n(NESS). Here we focus on one of the distinctive features of NESS, persistent\nprobability currents, and their manifestations in our climate system. We\nconsider the natural variability of the steady-state climate system, which can\nbe approximated as a NESS. These currents must form closed loops, which are odd\nunder time reversal, providing the crucial difference between systems in\nthermal equilibrium and NESS. Seeking manifestations of such current loops\nleads us naturally to the notion of probability angular momentum and\noscillations in the space of observables. Specifically, we will relate this\nconcept to the asymmetric part of certain time-dependent correlation functions.\nApplying this approach, we propose that these current loops give rise to\npreferred spatio-temporal patterns of natural climate variability that take the\nform of climate oscillations such as the El-Ni\\~{n}o Southern Oscillation\n(ENSO) and the Madden-Julien Oscillation (MJO). In the space of climate\nindices, we observe persistent currents and define a new diagnostic for these\ncurrents: the probability angular momentum. Using the observed climatic time\nseries of ENSO and MJO, we compute both the averages and the distributions of\nthe probability angular momentum. These results are in good agreement with the\nanalysis from a linear Gaussian model. We propose that, in addition to being a\nnew quantification of climate oscillations across models and observations, the\nprobability angular momentum provides a meaningful characterization for all\nstatistical systems in NESS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 17:52:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 20:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

Here we raise the possibility that\nstellar collisions may be sufficiently frequent and energetic to inhibit the\ncontraction of the massive protostar, avoiding strong UV radiation driven\noutflows, and allowing it to continue growing into an SMS. We investigate this\nscenario with semianalytic models incorporating star formation, gas accretion,\ndynamical friction from stars and gas, stellar collisions, and gas ejection. We\nfind that when the collapsing gas fragments at a density of $\\lesssim 3\\times\n10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, the central protostar contracts due to infrequent\nstellar mergers, and in turn photoevaporates the remaining collapsing gas,\nresulting in the formation of a $\\lesssim 10^4~{\\rm M_\\odot}$ object.

We find that a correct modelling of magnification is\ncrucial in order not to bias the estimation of cosmological parameters,\nespecially in the case of deep galaxy surveys. Our case study adopts\nspecifications of the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU), which is a\nfull-sky, deep radio-continuum survey, and is expected to probe the Universe up\nto redshift $z\\sim6$. We assume the Limber approximation, and include\nmagnification bias on top of density fluctuations and redshift-space\ndistortions. By restricting our analysis to the regime where the Limber\napproximation holds true, we significantly minimise the computational time\nneeded, compared to that of the exact calculation. We also show that there is a\ntrend for more biased parameter estimates from neglecting magnification when\nthe redshift bins are very wide. We conclude that this result implies a strong\ndependence on the lensing contribution, which is an integrated effect and\nbecomes dominant when wide redshift bins are considered. Finally, we note that\ninstead of being considered a contaminant, magnification bias encodes important\ncosmological information, and its inclusion leads to an alleviation of the\ndegeneracy between the galaxy bias and the amplitude normalisation of the\nmatter fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 18:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 18:32:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-28"}

We supplement the near-continuous 4-year Kepler light curve\nwith ground-based multicolor photometry from Mount Laguna Observatory and\nspectroscopy from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope.

We find\nthat the stellar radii are consistent with theoretical models within the\nuncertainties, whereas the temperature of the secondary star is $\\sim$6% cooler\nthan predicted. An important aspect of this work is that the uncertainties\nderived from a single epoch (individual night of observations) underestimates\nthe overall system parameter uncertainties due to the effect of the 1-4%\nfluctuations caused by stellar activity.

Accretion-powered radiation from\nhigh-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) is still one of the leading proposed\nexplanations for the missing $\\mathrm{He^+}$-ionizing photons, but this\nscenario has yet to be conclusively tested. In this paper, we present nebular\nline predictions from a grid of photoionization models with input SEDs\ncontaining the joint contribution of both stellar atmospheres and a multi-color\ndisk model for HMXBs. This grid demonstrates that HMXBs are inefficient\nproducers of the photons necessary to power HeII, and can only boost this line\nsubstantially in galaxies with HMXB populations large enough to power X-ray\nluminosities of $10^{42}$ erg/s per unit star formation rate (SFR). To test\nthis, we assemble a sample of eleven low-redshift star-forming galaxies with\nhigh-quality constraints on both X-ray emission from Chandra and HeII emission\nfrom deep optical spectra, including new observations with the MMT. These data\nreveal that the HMXB populations of these nearby systems are insufficient to\naccount for the observed HeII strengths, with typical X-ray luminosities or\nupper limits thereon of only $10^{40}$-$10^{41}$ erg/s per SFR. This indicates\nthat HMXBs are not the dominant source of $\\mathrm{He^+}$ ionization in these\nmetal-poor star-forming galaxies.

Specifically, given\na black-box access to the target classifier, the attacker trains a binary\nclassifier, which takes a data sample's confidence score vector predicted by\nthe target classifier as an input and predicts the data sample to be a member\nor non-member of the target classifier's training dataset. Membership inference\nattacks pose severe privacy and security threats to the training dataset. Most\nexisting defenses leverage differential privacy when training the target\nclassifier or regularize the training process of the target classifier. These\ndefenses suffer from two key limitations: 1) they do not have formal\nutility-loss guarantees of the confidence score vectors, and 2) they achieve\nsuboptimal privacy-utility tradeoffs.\n  In this work, we propose MemGuard, the first defense with formal utility-loss\nguarantees against black-box membership inference attacks. Instead of tampering\nthe training process of the target classifier, MemGuard adds noise to each\nconfidence score vector predicted by the target classifier. Our key observation\nis that attacker uses a classifier to predict member or non-member and\nclassifier is vulnerable to adversarial examples. Based on the observation, we\npropose to add a carefully crafted noise vector to a confidence score vector to\nturn it into an adversarial example that misleads the attacker's classifier.\nOur experimental results on three datasets show that MemGuard can effectively\ndefend against membership inference attacks and achieve better privacy-utility\ntradeoffs than existing defenses. Our work is the first one to show that\nadversarial examples can be used as defensive mechanisms to defend against\nmembership inference attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 19:46:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 01:54:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 21:38:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-20"}

The\nearly-time observations reveal multiple emission components that evolve\nindependently, with a delayed power-law component that exhibits significant\nspectral attenuation above 40 MeV in the first few seconds of the burst. This\npower-law component transitions to a harder spectrum that is consistent with\nthe afterglow emission observed at later times. This afterglow component is\nclearly identifiable in the GBM and BAT light curves as a slowly fading\nemission component on which the rest of the prompt emission is superimposed. As\na result, we are able to constrain the transition from internal shock to\nexternal shock dominated emission. We find that the temporal and spectral\nevolution of the broadband afterglow emission can be well modeled as\nsynchrotron emission from a forward shock propagating into a wind-like\ncircumstellar environment and find that high-energy photons observed by Fermi\nLAT are in tension with the theoretical maximum energy that can be achieved\nthrough synchrotron emission from a shock. These violations of the maximum\nsynchrotron energy are further compounded by the detection of very high energy\n(VHE) emission above 300 GeV by MAGIC concurrent with our observations. We\nconclude that the observations of VHE photons from GRB 190114C necessitates\neither an additional emission mechanism at very high energies that is hidden in\nthe synchrotron component in the LAT energy range, an acceleration mechanism\nthat imparts energy to the particles at a rate that is faster than the electron\nsynchrotron energy loss rate, or revisions of the fundamental assumptions used\nin estimating the maximum photon energy attainable through the synchrotron\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 20:24:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 21:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

This work\nfocuses on the influence of the discretization approach and the adaptation\nstrategy on the optimization results and computational cost. The geometry of\nthe design is represented implicitly by the iso-contour of a level set\nfunction. An immersed boundary technique, here the extended finite element\nmethod, is used to predict the structural response. Both the level set function\nand the state variable fields are discretized by hierarchical B-splines. While\nonly first-order B-splines are used for the state variable fields, up to third\norder B-splines are considered for discretizing the level set function. The\ndiscretizations of the level set function and the state variable fields are\nlocally refined along the material interfaces and selectively coarsened within\nthe bulk phases. For locally refined/coarsened meshes, truncated B-splines are\nconsidered. The properties of the proposed mesh adaptation strategy are studied\nfor level set topology optimization where either the initial design is\ncomprised of a uniform array of inclusions or inclusions are generated during\nthe optimization process. Numerical studies employing static linear elastic\nmaterial/void problems in 2D and 3D demonstrate the ability of the proposed\nmethod to start from a coarse mesh and converge to designs with complex\ngeometries and fine features, reducing the overall computational cost.\nComparing optimization results for different B-spline orders suggests that\nhigher order basis functions promote the development of smooth designs and\nsuppress the emergence of small features, without providing an explicit feature\nsize control. A distinct advantage of cubic over quadratic B-splines is not\nobserved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 20:31:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Implicit time-stepping schemes are often favored in mechanics due to\ntheir ability to take larger time steps in quasistatic and moderate dynamic\nproblems. Furthermore, initially rigid cohesive models are typically preferred\nwhen the location of the crack is not known in advance, since initially elastic\nmodels artificially lower the material stiffness. It is challenging to include\nan initially rigid cohesive model in an implicit scheme because the initiation\nof fracture corresponds to a nondifferentiability of the underlying potential.\nIn this work, an interior-point method is proposed for implicit time stepping\nof initially rigid cohesive fracture. It uses techniques developed for convex\nsecond-order cone programming for the nonconvex problem at hand. The underlying\ncohesive model is taken from Papoulia (2017) and is based on a\nnondifferentiable energy function. That previous work proposed an algorithm\nbased on successive smooth approximations to the nondifferential objective for\nsolving the resulting optimization problem. It is argued herein that cone\nprogramming can capture the nondifferentiability without smoothing, and the\nresulting cone formulation is amenable to interior-point algorithms. A further\nbenefit of the formulation is that other conic inequality constraints are\nstraightforward to incorporate. Computational results are provided showing that\ncertain contact constraints can be easily handled and that the method is\npractical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 22:13:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

In this work we present a very simple\nphenomenological model for the anisotropy, under the \\textit{macrospin}\napproximation, in which the resultant anisotropy is just directly proportional\nto the amount of $Co$. First, we perform a detailed analysis on a rather ideal\nsystem in which the extreme values have the same magnitude (i.e.\n$|K_{C}^{-}|=|K_{C}^{+}|$) and then we focus on the real $Co_{x}Fe_{3-x}O_{4}$\nsystem, for which $|K_{C}^{+}|\\sim 18|K_{C}^{-}|$.

In this paper we take on this major challenge and consider the problem\nof characterizing all testable graph properties in general planar graphs.\n  We consider the model in which a general planar graph can be accessed by the\nrandom neighbor oracle that allows access to any given vertex and access to a\nrandom neighbor of a given vertex. We show that, informally, a graph property\n$P$ is testable with one-sided error for general planar graphs if and only if\ntesting $P$ can be reduced to testing for a finite family of finite forbidden\nsubgraphs.

The sufficient\ncondition in the characterization reduces the problem to the task of testing\n$H$-freeness in planar graphs, and is the main and most challenging technical\ncontribution of the paper: we show that for planar graphs (with arbitrary\ndegrees), the property of being $H$-free is testable with one-sided error for\nevery finite graph $H$, in the random neighbor oracle model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 23:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Practical observations,\nhowever, often contain compositional noise, i.e. a nonlinear shift along the\ntime axis, which makes standard methods not directly applicable. The key\nchallenge is that these observations are not \"aligned\", and registration\nprocedures are required for successful estimation. In this paper, we propose an\nalignment-based framework for positive intensity estimation. We first show that\nthe intensity function is area-preserved with respect to compositional noise.\nSuch a property implies that the time warping is only encoded in the normalized\nintensity, or density, function. Then, we decompose the estimation of the\nintensity by the product of the estimated total intensity and estimated\ndensity. The estimation of the density relies on a metric which measures the\nphase difference between two density functions. An asymptotic study shows that\nthe proposed estimation algorithm provides a consistent estimator for the\nnormalized intensity. We then extend the framework to estimating non-negative\nintensity functions. The success of the proposed estimation algorithms is\nillustrated using two simulations.

Despite the\nexciting advances in this cross-section of finance and AI, many of the current\napproaches are limited to using technical analysis to capture historical trends\nof each stock price and thus limited to certain experimental setups to obtain\ngood prediction results. On the other hand, professional investors additionally\nuse their rich knowledge of inter-market and inter-company relations to map the\nconnectivity of companies and events, and use this map to make better market\npredictions. For instance, they would predict the movement of a certain\ncompany's stock price based not only on its former stock price trends but also\non the performance of its suppliers or customers, the overall industry,\nmacroeconomic factors and trade policies. This paper investigates the\neffectiveness of work at the intersection of market predictions and graph\nneural networks, which hold the potential to mimic the ways in which investors\nmake decisions by incorporating company knowledge graphs directly into the\npredictive model. The main goal of this work is to test the validity of this\napproach across different markets and longer time horizons for backtesting\nusing rolling window analysis. In this work, we concentrate on the prediction\nof individual stock prices in the Japanese Nikkei 225 market over a period of\nroughly 20 years.

The goal is to minimize the number of\nqueries made in order to correctly guess $\\mathbf{y}$.\n  Motivated by this question, in this work, we develop a nonadaptive polynomial\ntime algorithm that works for a natural class of separable distance measures,\ni.e.\\ coordinate-wise sums of functions of the absolute value.

The origin of the different diffusivities turns out to\ncome from the heterogeneity of the activation energies on the potential energy\nlandscapes.

This problem can be effectively solved by\nminimizing a nonconvex amplitude-based loss function. However, this loss\nfunction is non-smooth. To address the non-smoothness, a series of methods have\nbeen proposed by adding truncating, reweighting and smoothing operations to\nadjust the gradient or the loss function and achieved better performance. But\nthese operations bring about extra rules and parameters that need to be\ncarefully designed.

Such a\nnew heuristic can be regarded as a smooth version of the original non-smooth\namplitude-based loss function.

Substantial numerical tests\nempirically illustrate that the proposed heuristic is significantly superior to\nthe original amplitude-based loss function and SAF also outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of the recovery rate and the converging\nspeed.

The galaxy is first identified as a massive z>~4\ngalaxy with suppressed star formation from photometric redshifts based on deep\nmulti-band data in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey field. A follow-up\nspectroscopic observation with MOSFIRE on Keck revealed strong multiple\nabsorption features, which are identified as Balmer absorption lines, giving a\nsecure redshift of z=4.01. Thanks to the high S/N of the spectrum, we are able\nto estimate the stellar velocity dispersion, sigma=268+/-59 km/s. This velocity\ndispersion is consistent with that of massive galaxies today, implying no\nsignificant evolution in stellar velocity dispersion over the last 12 Gyr.\nBased on an upper limit on its physical size from deep optical images\n(r_eff<1.3 kpc), we find that its dynamical mass is consistent with the stellar\nmass inferred from photometry. Furthermore, the galaxy is located on the mass\nfundamental plane extrapolated from lower redshift galaxies. Combining all\nthese results, we find that the velocity dispersion does not significantly\nevolve with redshift, although the size and mass of massive quenched galaxies\ndo. This suggests that the mass in the core of massive galaxies does not evolve\nsignificantly, while most of the mass growth occurs in the outskirts of the\ngalaxies, which also increases the size.

It is important to summarise and consolidate the existing knowledge\nin the area to provide directions to researchers and practitioners. This\nresearch work provides a systematic literature review in the area of test case\nrepair and breakage prevention, aiming to guide researchers and practitioners\nin the field of software testing. Method: We followed the standard protocol for\nconducting a systematic literature review. First, research goals were defined\nusing the Goal Question Metric (GQM). Then we formulate research questions\ncorresponding to each goal. Finally, metrics are extracted from the included\npapers. Based on the defined selection criteria a final set of 41 primary\nstudies are included for analysis. Results: The selection process resulted in 5\njournal papers, and 36 conference papers.

(i) The inter-dimer hopping,\n$t_{b1}$, which gives rise to the \"transverse field\" in the Ising model for the\ndipoles ($H^T=2t_{b1}$), is between a third and a tenth smaller in the mercuric\nmaterials than for the mercury-free salts. (ii) The Ising model of dipoles is\nin the quasi-one-dimensional limit for the mercuric salts, but\nquasi-two-dimensional (between the square and isotropic triangular limits) for\nthe mercury-free materials. Thus, the dimensionless critical field is much\nsmaller in the mercuric compounds.

We show that dipolar order and even short-range\ndipolar correlations have a profound impact on the nature of the interdimer\nmagnetic (superexchange) interactions. For example, dipole crystallization\ndrives the materials towards quasi-one-dimensional magnetic interactions, which\ncould be important for understanding the spin liquids found in some of these\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 08:15:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

We investigate the transfer of energy between a standing kink mode and\nazimuthal Alfven waves within an expanding flux tube. We consider the process\nof resonant absorption in a loop with a non-uniform Alfven frequency profile\nbut in the absence of a radial density gradient. Methods. Using the MHD code,\nLare3d, we model an oscillating magnetic flux tube that expands radially with\nheight. An initially straight loop structure with a magnetic field enhancement\nis relaxed towards a force-free state before a standing kink mode is\nintroduced. Results. We demonstrate that the transverse gradient in Alfven\nfrequency required for the existence of resonant field lines can be associated\nwith the expansion of a high field-strength flux tube from concentrated flux\npatches. This allows for the conversion of energy between wave modes even in\nthe absence of the density profile typically assumed in wave heating models. As\nwith standing modes in straight flux tubes, small scales are dominated by the\nvorticity at the loop apex and by currents at the foot points. The azimuthal\nwave exhibits the structure of the expanded flux tube and is therefore\nassociated with smaller length scales close to the foot points of the flux\ntube. Conclusions. Resonant absorption can proceed throughout the corona, even\nin the absence of dense loop structures. The flux tube and MHD waves considered\nare difficult to observe and our model highlights how estimating hidden wave\npower within the solar atmosphere can be problematic. We highlight that, for\nstanding modes, the global properties of field lines are important for resonant\nabsorption and coronal conditions at a single altitude will not fully determine\nthe nature of MHD resonances.

Therefore, it is clear that the automatic\nidentification of adverse events is a major challenge for patient safety. In\nthis paper, we have proposed a method enabling us to identify such deviations.\nWe have focused on identifying surgeons' deviations from standard surgical\nprocesses due to surgical events rather than anatomic specificities. This is\nparticularly challenging, given the high variability in typical surgical\nprocedure workflows. Methods: We have introduced a new approach designed to\nautomatically detect and distinguish surgical process deviations based on\nmulti-dimensional non-linear temporal scaling with a hidden semi-Markov model\nusing manual annotation of surgical processes.

This paper uses these and other relations\nto ``reverse-engineer'' the quenching process for central galaxies. The basic\nidea is that star-forming galaxies with larger radii (at a given stellar mass)\nhave lower black-hole masses due to lower central densities. Galaxies cross\ninto the green valley when the cumulative effective energy radiated by their\nblack hole equals $\\sim4\\times$ their halo-gas binding energy. Since\nlarger-radii galaxies have smaller black holes, one finds they must evolve to\nhigher stellar masses in order to meet this halo-energy criterion, which\nexplains the sloping boundaries. A possible cause of radii differences among\nstar-forming galaxies is halo concentration. The evolutionary tracks of\nstar-forming galaxies are nearly parallel to the green-valley boundaries, and\nit is mainly the sideways motions of these boundaries with cosmic time that\ncause galaxies to quench. BH-scaling laws for star-forming, quenched, and\ngreen-valley galaxies are different, and most BH mass growth takes place in the\ngreen valley. Implications include: the radii of star-forming galaxies are an\nimportant second parameter in shaping their black holes; black holes are\nconnected to their halos but in different ways for star-forming, quenched, and\ngreen-valley galaxies; and the same BH-halo quenching mechanism has been in\nplace since $z \\sim 3$. We conclude with a discussion of black hole-galaxy\nco-evolution, the origin and interpretation of BH scaling laws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 11:25:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 08:00:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 09:20:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Such artificial atom has a size much\nlarger than the photon wavelength, which enables passive and active\nultra-strong coupling to traveling photons. High-fidelity quantum control-phase\ngate is realized by mediating the phase between photons with an intermediate\nartificial atom in a photonic molecule structure.

Training such systems usually requires a large amount of cross-camera\npedestrians to be annotated from surveillance videos, which is labor-consuming\nespecially when the number of cameras is large. Differently, this paper\ninvestigates ReID in an unexplored single-camera-training (SCT) setting, where\neach person in the training set appears in only one camera. To the best of our\nknowledge, this setting was never studied before. SCT enjoys the advantage of\nlow-cost data collection and annotation, and thus eases ReID systems to be\ntrained in a brand new environment. However, it raises major challenges due to\nthe lack of cross-camera person occurrences, which conventional approaches\nheavily rely on to extract discriminative features. The key to dealing with the\nchallenges in the SCT setting lies in designing an effective mechanism to\ncomplement cross-camera annotation. We start with a regular deep network for\nfeature extraction, upon which we propose a novel loss function named\nmulti-camera negative loss (MCNL). This is a metric learning loss motivated by\nprobability, suggesting that in a multi-camera system, one image is more likely\nto be closer to the most similar negative sample in other cameras than to the\nmost similar negative sample in the same camera. In experiments, MCNL\nsignificantly boosts ReID accuracy in the SCT setting, which paves the way of\nfast deployment of ReID systems with good performance on new target scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 12:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

We begin by providing a\ncondensed overview of the active inference literature, in particular viewing\nthe various natural behaviors of active inference agents through the lens of\nRL. We show that by operating in a pure belief-based setting, active inference\nagents can carry out epistemic exploration, and account for uncertainty about\ntheir environment in a Bayes-optimal fashion. Furthermore, we show that the\nreliance on an explicit reward signal in RL is removed in active inference,\nwhere reward can simply be treated as another observation; even in the total\nabsence of rewards, agent behaviors are learned through preference learning. We\nmake these properties explicit by showing two scenarios in which active\ninference agents can infer behaviors in reward-free environments compared to\nboth Q-learning and Bayesian model-based RL agents; by placing zero prior\npreferences over rewards and by learning the prior preferences over the\nobservations corresponding to reward. We conclude by noting that this formalism\ncan be applied to more complex settings if appropriate generative models can be\nformulated.

It is a widely used technique for\nsoftware quality assurance, but there has been much debate by practitioners\nconcerning its failure-detection effectiveness. RT is argued to be possibly\nless effective by some researchers as it does not utilize any information about\nthe program under test. Efforts to mainly improve the failure-detection\ncapability of RT, have led to the proposition of Adaptive Random Testing (ART).\nART takes advantage of the location information of previous non-fault-detecting\ntest cases to enhance effectiveness as compared to RT. The approach has gained\npopularity and has a large number of theoretical studies and methods that\nemploy different notions. In this review, our goal is to provide an overview of\nexisting ART studies. We classify all ART studies and assess existing ART\nmethods for numeric programs with a focus on their motivation, strategy, and\nfindings. The study also discusses several worthy avenues related to ART. The\nreview uses 109 ART papers in several journals, workshops, and conference\nproceedings.

It is important to accurately evaluate the significance\nof such discordances when present. We propose here a Bayesian interpretation of\ninconsistency measures that can extract information about physical\ninconsistencies in the presence of data scatter. The new framework is based on\nthe conditional probability distribution of the level of physical inconsistency\ngiven the obtained value of the measure. We use the index of inconsistency as a\ncase study to illustrate the new interpretation framework, but this can be\ngeneralized to other metrics. Importantly, there are two aspects in the\nquantification of inconsistency that behave differently as the number of model\nparameters increases. The first is the probability for the level of physical\ninconsistency to reach a threshold which drops with the increase of the number\nof parameters under consideration. Then the second is the actual level of\nphysical inconsistency which remains rather insensitive to such an increase in\nparameters. This often-overlooked ambiguity leads to an underestimation of the\nphysical inconsistency by the commonly adopted significance level when used,\nbut is resolved by the Bayesian interpretation because the conditional\nprobability distribution includes all the statistical information of the level\nof physical inconsistency. Finally, we apply the Bayesian interpretation to\nexamine the (in)consistency between Planck versus the Cepheid-based local\nmeasurement, the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Atacama Cosmology Telescope\n(ACT) and WMAP. We confirm and revisit the degrees of previous physical\ninconsistencies and show the stability of the new interpretation to the number\nof cosmological parameters compared to the commonly used n-$\\sigma$\ninterpretation when applied to cosmological tensions in multi-parameter spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 15:17:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 16:41:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 07:23:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

With\nthe advent of mobile health (m-Health) sustained on service-oriented\narchitectures, the adaptation of blockchain mechanisms into m-Health\napplications creates the possibility for a more decentralized and available\nhealthcare service. Hence, this paper presents a review of the current security\nbest practices for m-Health including blockchain technologies in healthcare.\nMoreover, it discusses and elaborates on identified open-issues and\npotentialities regarding the uses of Blockchain.

The main goal of the theory is to formulate all the\nnavigation observables within the General Relativity Theory (GRT). The same\napproach should be applied also to the intersatellite GPS-communications (in\nperspective also between the GPS, GLONASS and Galileo satellite\nconstellations). In this paper a theoretical approach has been developed for\nISC between two satellites moving on (one-plane) elliptical orbits based on the\nintroduction of two gravity null cones with origins at the emitting-signal and\nreceiving-signal satellites. The two null cones account for the variable\ndistance between the satellites during their uncorrelated motion. This\nintersection of the two null cones gives the space-time interval in GRT.\nApplying some theorems from higher algebra, it was proved that this space-time\ndistance can become zero, consequently it can be also negative and positive.\nBut in order to represent the geodesic distance travelled by the signal, the\nspace-time interval has to be \"compatible\" with the Euclidean distance. So this\n\"compatibility condition\", conditionally called \"condition for ISC\", is the\nmost important consequence of the theory. The other important consequence is\nthat the geodesic distance turns out to be the space-time interval, but with\naccount also of the \"condition for ISC\". The geodesic distance is proved to be\ngreater than the Euclidean distance - a result, entirely based on the \"two null\ncones approach\" and moreover, without any use of the Shapiro delay formulae.\nApplication of the same higher algebra theorems shows that the geodesic\ndistance cannot have any zeroes, in accord with being greater than the\nEuclidean distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 09:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-30"}

We note that the migration dynamics and the final\nequilibrium position are almost independent of the Reynolds number, while they\nstrongly depend on the particle elasticity; in particular, the migration is\nfaster as the elasticity increases (i.e. the particle is more deformable), with\nthe particle reaching the final equilibrium position at the centerline in\nshorter times. Our simulations show that the results are not affected by the\nparticle initial conditions, position and velocity. Finally, we explain the\nparticle migration by computing the total force acting on the particle and its\ndifferent components, viscous and elastic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 02:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-04"}

However, their\nroutine use is yet to become reality. A major obstacle is the ability to\nmaintain the polarization state of light over a broad range of wavelengths,\nwhile also ensuring low attenuation and single-mode guidance. Here we\nsimulated, fabricated and characterized a single-mode polarization-maintaining\nanti-resonant hollow-core fiber. The birefringence was achieved by introducing\nresonators of different thicknesses, thereby creating reduced symmetry in the\nstructure. The measured group birefringence of 4.4x10-5 at 1550 nm is in good\nagreement with the calculated group birefringence from the simulations. This\ncorresponds to a phase birefringence of 2.5x10-5 at 1550 nm. The measured loss\nof the fiber was 0.46 dB/m at 1550 nm. With its simple structure, low loss, and\nbroadband operation this polarization-maintaining anti-resonant hollow-core\nfiber is a serious contender for applications in gas-based nonlinear optics and\ncommunications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 09:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-07"}

Due to the complexity of fabric states and dynamics, we apply deep\nimitation learning to learn policies that, given color (RGB), depth (D), or\ncombined color-depth (RGBD) images of a rectangular fabric sample, estimate\npick points and pull vectors to spread the fabric to maximize coverage. To\ngenerate data, we develop a fabric simulator and an algorithmic supervisor that\nhas access to complete state information. We train policies in simulation using\ndomain randomization and dataset aggregation (DAgger) on three tiers of\ndifficulty in the initial randomized configuration. We present results\ncomparing five baseline policies to learned policies and report systematic\ncomparisons of RGB vs D vs RGBD images as inputs. In simulation, learned\npolicies achieve comparable or superior performance to analytic baselines. In\n180 physical experiments with the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) surgical robot,\nRGBD policies trained in simulation attain coverage of 83% to 95% depending on\ndifficulty tier, suggesting that effective fabric smoothing policies can be\nlearned from an algorithmic supervisor and that depth sensing is a valuable\naddition to color alone.
