With a semantic\nsegmentation model, the free space can be extracted. The scans of the virtual\nLiDAR are generated by discretizing the contours of the free space. As for the\npose tracker, we propose a visual odometry system fusing both the feature\nmatching and the virtual LiDAR scan matching results. Only those feature points\nlocated in the free space area are utilized to ensure the 2D-2D matching for\npose estimation. Furthermore, bundle adjustment (BA) is performed to minimize\nthe feature points reprojection error and scan matching error. We apply our\nsystem to an autonomous vehicle equipped with four fisheye cameras.

This study explores the emission of CH$_3$CCH in the low-mass\nprotostellar binary, IRAS 16293$-$2422, examining the spatial scales traced by\nthis molecule, as well as its formation and destruction pathways.\n  Methods.

However, MBCs are\nchallenging targets to study remotely due to their small sizes and the\nrelatively large distance they are from the Sun and the Earth. Recently, a\nnumber of weakly active short-period comets have been identified that might\noriginate in the asteroid main belt. Among all of the known candidates, comet\n66P/du Toit has been suggested to have one of the highest probabilities of\ncoming from the main belt. We obtained medium and high-resolution spectra of\n66P from 300-2500 nm with the X-shooter/VLT and the UVES/VLT instruments in\nJuly 2018. We also obtained a series of narrow-band images of 66P to monitor\nthe gas and dust activity between May and July 2018 with TRAPPIST-South. In\naddition, we applied a dust model to characterize the dust coma of 66P and\nperformed dynamical simulations to study the orbital evolution of 66P. We\nderive the OPR of ammonia (NH$_3$) in 66P to be 1.08$\\pm$0.06, which\ncorresponds to a nuclear spin temperature of $\\sim$34 K. We computed the\nproduction rates of OH, NH, CN, C$_3,$ and C$_2$ radicals and measured the dust\nproxy, Af$\\rho$. The dust analysis reveals that the coma can be best-fit with\nan anisotropic model and the peak dust production rate is about 55 kg s$^{-1}$\nat the perihelion distance of 1.29 au. Dynamical simulations show that 66P is\nmoderately asteroidal with the capture time, t$_{cap} \\sim 10^4$ yr. Our\nobservations demonstrate that the measured physical properties of 66P are\nconsistent with other typical short-period comets and differ significantly from\nother MBCs. Therefore, 66P is unlikely to have a main belt origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2019 18:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

Through AdS/CFT, progress has been made in\nunderstanding the structure of entanglement in quantum field theories, and in\nhow gravitational physics can emerge from these structures. However, this\nunderstanding is far from complete and will require the development of new\ntools to quantify correlations in CFT.\n  This thesis presents refinements of a duality between operator product\nexpansion (OPE) blocks in the CFT, giving the contribution of a conformal\nfamily to the OPE, and geodesic integrated fields in AdS which are\ndiffeomorphism invariant quantities. This duality was originally discovered in\nthe maximally symmetric setting of pure AdS dual to the CFT ground state. In\nless symmetric states the duality must be modified. Working with excited states\nwithin AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, this thesis shows how the OPE block decomposes into\nmore fine-grained CFT observables that are dual to AdS fields integrated over\nnon-minimal geodesics.\n  Additionally, this thesis contains results on the dynamics of entanglement\nmeasures for general quantum systems. Results are presented for the family of\nquantum R\\'enyi entropies and entanglement negativity. R\\'enyi entropies are\nstudied for general dynamics by imposing special initial conditions. Around\npure, separable initial states, all R\\'enyi entropies grow with the same\ntimescale at leading, and next-to-leading order. Mathematical tools are\ndeveloped for the differentiation of non-analytic matrix functions with respect\nto constrained arguments and are used to construct analytic expressions for\nderivatives of negativity. We establish bounds on the rate of change of state\ndistinguishability and the rate of entanglement growth for closed systems.\nNote: Abstract shortened.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2019 19:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

During the late\nstages of stellar evolution, the physics of some phenomena, such as episodic\nand systematic mass loss, are not well constrained. For example, the physical\nproperties of red supergiants (RSGs) in different metallicity regimes remain\npoorly understood. Thus, we initiated a systematic study of RSGs in dwarf\nirregular galaxies (dIrrs) in the Local Group. The target selection is based on\n3.6 $\\mu$m and 4.5 $\\mu$m photometry from archival Spitzer Space Telescope\nimages of nearby galaxies. We selected 46 targets in the dIrrs IC 10, IC 1613,\nSextans B, and the Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM) galaxy that we observed with the\nGTC-OSIRIS and VLT-FORS2 instruments.

The former converges for all finite values of\nthe complex variable, $z$, but it requires a large number of terms for large\nvalues of $|z|$, and the latter is a Poincar\\'{e}-type expansion which is\nwell-suited for such large values and where optimal truncation is possible. The\nasymptotic series of the Airy function shows a classical example of the Stokes\nphenomenon where a type of discontinuity occurs for the homonymous multipliers.\nA new series expansion is presented here that stems from the method of steepest\ndescents, as can the asymptotic series, but which is convergent for all values\nof the complex variable. It originates in the integration of uniformly\nconvergent power series representing the integrand of the Airy's integral in\ndifferent sections of the integration path. The new series expansion is not a\npower series and instead relies on the calculation of complete and incomplete\nGamma functions. In this sense, it is related to the Hadamard expansions. It is\nan alternative expansion to the two main aforementioned power series that also\noffers some insight into the transition zone for the Stokes' multipliers due to\nthe splitting of the integration path. Unlike the Hadamard series, it relies on\nonly two different expansions, separated by a branch point, one of which is\ncentered at infinity. The interest of the new series expansion is mainly a\ntheoretical one in a twofold way. First of all, it shows how to convert an\nasymptotic series into a convergent one, even if the rate of convergence may be\nslow for small values of $|z|$. Secondly, it sheds some light on the Stokes\nphenomenon for the Airy function by showing the transition of the integration\npaths at $\\arg z = \\pm 2 \\pi/3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2019 23:01:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 19:46:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 21:23:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-22"}

Furthermore, the reliability of such methods is higher when the\nnature of short-ranged interactions need not be modeled explicitly. This may be\nnecessary for two reasons: (1) there are interactions that occur over a short\nrange that cannot be accurately modeled with a potential function and/or (2)\nthe entire Hamiltonian loses its reliability when applied at short distances.\nThis work is an investigation of the utility and consequences of omitting a\nfinite region of space from quantum mechanical analysis, accomplished by\nimposition of an artificial boundary behind which obscured short-ranged\nphysical effects may operate. With this method, a free function of integration\nthat depends on momentum is interpreted as a function encoding information\nneeded to match a long-distance wavefunction to an appropriate state function\non the other side of the boundary. Omitting part of the space from analysis\nimplies that the strict unitarity requirement of quantum mechanics must be\nrelaxed, since particles can actually propagate beyond the boundary. Strict\northogonality of eigenmodes and hermiticity of the Hamiltonian must also be\nrelaxed in this method; however, all of these canonical relations are obeyed\nwhen averaged over sufficiently long times. What is achieved, therefore,\nappears to be an effective long-wavelength theory, at least for stationary\nsystems.

Most existing learning methods mainly focus\non isolated intersections and suffer from inefficient training. This paper aims\nat the cooperative control for large scale multi-intersection traffic signal,\nin which a novel end-to-end learning based model is established and the\nefficient training method is proposed correspondingly. In the proposed model,\nthe input traffic status in multi-intersections is represented by a tensor,\nwhich not only significantly reduces dimensionality than using a single matrix\nbut also avoids information loss. For the output, a multidimensional boolean\nvector is employed for the control policy to indicate whether the signal state\nchanges or not, which simplifies the representation and abides the practical\nphase changing rules. In the proposed model, a multi-task learning structure is\nused to get the cooperative policy by learning. Instead of only using the\nreinforcement learning to train the model, we employ imitation learning to\nintegrate a rule based model with neural networks to do the pre-training, which\nprovides a reliable and satisfactory stage solution and greatly accelerates the\nconvergence. Afterwards, the reinforcement learning method is adopted to\ncontinue the fine training, where proximal policy optimization algorithm is\nincorporated to solve the policy collapse problem in multi-dimensional output\nsituation. In numerical experiments, the advantages of the proposed model are\ndemonstrated with comparison to the related state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 02:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

An attractive approach to\npower biomedical implants is to use wireless power transfer (WPT) with\nultrasound. To receive the ultrasonic energy, a piezoelectric transducer is\nimplemented, which is designed to have the resonance frequency at the frequency\nof the ultrasonic wave. To extract the received energy from the transducer, an\nenergy rectification circuit is typically required. The commonly used rectifier\nis called a synchronized switch harvesting on inductor (SSHI) rectifier, which\nemploys an inductor to increase the energy efficiency. However, the employment\nof inductor limits the system miniaturization since it usually needs to be\naround 1's mH. The synchronized switch harvesting on capacitors (SSHC)\nrectifier was recently proposed to be used on vibration energy harvesting and\nthis architecture achieves inductor-less fully integrated design. In a\nvibration energy harvesting system, the piezoelectric transducer usually has\nlarge inherent capacitance and low resonant frequency. But the piezoelectric\ntransducer used in ultrasonic WPT typically has very small capacitance and much\nhigher resonant frequency. In this paper, the performance of a SSHC rectifier\nused in ultrasonic WPT is analyzed. The analysis covers system size and\nperformance. Based on the analysis, this paper presents an important design\nconsideration on designing a SSHC rectifier to be used in ultrasonic WPT, which\nis the allowed maximal ON resistance in the capacitor-to-capacitor charging\nloop in function of the transducer capacitance, transducer resonant frequency\nand the number of SSHC stages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 04:33:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 00:35:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-22"}

This has inspired numerous scenarios that\nattempt to explain water anomalies. Despite recent breakthrough experiments\neliminating several of thous scenarios, we lacked a tool to localize the\nspinodal and the liquid-liquid critical point. We constructed a unique equation\nof state combining the famous Speedy's equation and the liquid-liquid critical\npoint to remove that deficit and to review these explanations. For the first\ntime, the proposed equation of state independently depicts the spinodal in the\npresence of the liquid-liquid critical point and demonstrates that the\nexplanation for water anomalies based on the reentrance of the spinodal is not\nvalid; this feature (reentering the spinodal) was solely predicted based on the\ncurved density surface caused by the existence of the second critical point.\nHowever, the critical point alone is not sufficient to explain the shape of the\ndensity surface of water. In the new equation, hydrogen bond cooperativity is\nimportant to force the critical point to exist outside of zero temperature.\nTogether with mounting evidence for the existence of a compressibility maximum\nbehind the homogeneous nucleation limit at positive pressure, the findings\npractically exclude all explanations for water anomalies except for the\nexistence of the liquid-liquid critical point at positive pressure.

This reconstruction\nis vastly under-determined, heavily stressing computing resources as well as\nmemory management and storage. To overcome these challenges, we leverage\nintrinsic three dimensional (3D) trajectories, such as 3D radial and 3D cones,\nwith ordering that incoherently cover time and k-space over the entire\nacquisition. We then propose two innovations: (1) A compressed representation\nusing multi-scale low rank matrix factorization that constrains the\nreconstruction problem, and reduces its memory footprint. (2) Stochastic\noptimization to reduce computation, improve memory locality, and minimize\ncommunications between threads and processors. We demonstrate the feasibility\nof the proposed method on DCE imaging acquired with a golden-angle ordered 3D\ncones trajectory and pulmonary imaging acquired with a bit-reversed ordered 3D\nradial trajectory.

This conclusion is reevaluated here by\nconsidering exact light propagation in a simple toy-model with average\naccelerated expansion. The toy-model and light propagation setup is explicitly\ndesigned for concordance between spatial averages and averages along light\nrays. While it is verified that redshift-distance relations are well described\nby average quantities in this setup, it is found that the redshift drift is\nnot. Specifically, the redshift drift is negative despite the on-average\nlate-time accelerated expansion of the model. This result implies that\nmeasuring redshift drift signals at low redshifts gives the potential for\ndirectly falsifying the backreaction conjecture. However, the results are based\non a toy-model so it is in principle possible that the result is an artifact\nand that redshift drift is in reality well described by spatially averaged\nquantities. The result therefore highlights the importance of developing\n\\emph{exact} solutions to the Einstein equations which exhibit average\naccelerated expansion without local expansion so that the relation between\nspatial averages and observations can be firmly established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 07:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

Interestingly, while the M1 series exhibits collective behavior\ntypical of strongly-coupled dipolar systems, the M2 series presents a more\ncomplex scenario where different magnetic properties resemble either\n\"individual-like\" or \"collective\", crucially emphasizing that the collective\ncharacter must be ascribed to specific properties and not to the system as a\nwhole. The strong differences between the two series, offer new insight\n(systematically ratified by simulations) into the subtle interplay between\ndipolar interactions, local anisotropy and sample heterogeneity, to determine\nthe behavior of dense assemblies of magnetic nanoparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 08:05:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-14"}

The setting is significant since tuple supervision is costly and\nsometimes even unavailable. However, the task is highly unconstrained and thus\nill-posed. To address this problem, we propose to introduce an auxiliary domain\nwhich shares a common underlying-structure space with the target domain, and we\nmake a partially shared latent space assumption. The key idea is to encourage\nthe partially shared latent variable to represent the similar underlying\nspatial structures in both domains, while the two domain-specific latent\nvariables will be unavoidably arranged to present renderings of two domains\nrespectively. This is achieved by designing two parallel generative networks\nwith a common Progressive Rendering Architecture (PRA), which constrains both\ngenerative networks' behaviors to model shared underlying structure and to\nmodel spatially dependent relation between rendering and underlying structure.\nThus, we propose DSRGAN (GANs for Disentangling Underlying Structure and\nRendering) to instantiate our method.

First, the existing approaches only consider shallow features of\nsource code such as method names and code tokens, but ignoring structured\nfeatures such as abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and control-flow graphs (CFGs) of\nsource code, which contains rich and well-defined semantics of source code.\nSecond, although the deep learning-based approach performs well on the\nrepresentation of source code, it lacks the explainability, making it hard to\ninterpret the retrieval results and almost impossible to understand which\nfeatures of source code contribute more to the final results.\n  To tackle the two aforementioned issues, this paper proposes MMAN, a novel\nMulti-Modal Attention Network for semantic source code retrieval.

Finally, we provide a\ntransformation formula for DT invariants (weighted by the Behrend function)\nunder iterated mutations as a counterpart of Nagao's result on topological DT\ninvariants. Our result leads to a perverse analogue of the $F$-series in\ncluster algebras. It also yields a Behrend--weighted Caldero--Chapoton formula\nfor what we call anti-cluster algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 08:38:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 13:30:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

Deep Q-learning,\nhowever, still suffers from poor data-efficiency and is susceptible to\nstochasticity in the environment or reward functions which is limiting with\nregard to real-world applications. We alleviate these problems by proposing two\nnovel off-policy Temporal-Difference formulations: (1) Truncated Q-functions\nwhich represent the return for the first n steps of a target-policy rollout\nw.r.t. the full action-value and (2) Shifted Q-functions, acting as the\nfarsighted return after this truncated rollout. This decomposition allows us to\noptimize both parts with their individual learning rates, achieving significant\nlearning speedup. We prove that the combination of these short- and long-term\npredictions is a representation of the full return, leading to the Composite\nQ-learning algorithm.

However, all of these\nnetworks appear as a common network model and they usually need to identify\nmultiple targets when applied. So the size of the input is very large.

This\ndegree of alignment ranges from the textured case (all easy axes pointing along\na common direction) to the non-textured case (randomly distributed easy axes).\nIn the former case we find long-range ferromagnetic order at low temperature\nbut, as the degree of alignment is diminished below a certain threshold, the\nferromagnetic phase gives way to a spin-glass phase. This spin-glass phase is\nsimilar to the one previously found in other dipolar systems with strong frozen\ndisorder. The transition between ferromagnetism and spin-glass passes through a\nnarrow intermediate phase with quasi-long-range ferromagnetic order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 10:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

According to the standard model for such\nevents, however, particles accelerated by the flare reconnection should remain\ntrapped in the flux rope comprising the coronal mass ejection. The particles\nshould reach the Earth only much later, along with the bulk ejecta. To resolve\nthis paradox, we have extended our previous axisymmetric model for the escape\nof flare-accelerated particles to fully three-dimensional (3D) geometries. We\nreport the results of magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a coronal system that\nconsists of a bipolar active region embedded in a background global dipole\nfield structured by solar wind. Our simulations show that multiple magnetic\nreconnection episodes occur prior to and during the CME eruption and its\ninterplanetary propagation. In addition to the episodes that build up the flux\nrope, reconnection between the open field and the CME couples the closed corona\nto the open interplanetary field. Flare-accelerated particles initially trapped\nin the CME thereby gain access to the open interplanetary field along a trail\nblazed by magnetic reconnection. A key difference between these 3D results and\nour previous calculations is that the interchange reconnection allows\naccelerated particles to escape from deep within the CME flux-rope. We estimate\nthe spatial extent of the particle-escape channels. The relative timings\nbetween flare acceleration and release of the energetic particles through\nCME/open-field coupling are also determined.

Recently, some\nsemi-supervised learning methods have been applied to UDA and achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance. One of the most popular approaches in\nsemi-supervised learning is the entropy minimization method.

We study the impact of this mass loss on the stability and\nlightcurves of X-ray binaries subject to the thermal-viscous instability, which\ndrives their outbursts. Strong mass loss could shut off outbursts early, as\nproposed for the 2015 outburst of V404 Cyg. We use an analytical model for\nthermal (Compton) wind mass loss. Scattering in the strong wind expected of\nlong Porb systems enhances the irradiation heating of the outer disc, keeping\nit stable against the thermal-viscous instability. This accounts very well for\nthe existence of persistently bright systems with large discs such as Cyg X-2,\n1E 1740.7-2942, or GRS 1758-258. Wind mass loss shortens the outburst, as\nexpected, but insufficiently to explain the rapid decay timescale of black hole\nX-ray binary outbursts. However, varying irradiation due to scattering in the\nwind produces lightcurves with plateaus in long Porb systems like GRO J1655-40.\nMass loss is not a major driver for the outburst dynamics up to luminosities\n0.1-0.2 L_Edd. Higher luminosities may produce stronger mass loss but their\nstudy is complicated since the wind becomes opaque. Magnetic winds seem more\npromising to explain the fast decay timescales generically seen in black hole\nX-ray binaries. Thermal winds can play an important role in the outburst\ndynamics through the varying irradiation heating. This may be evidenced by\nrelating changes in wind properties, X-ray spectra or luminosity, with changes\nin the optical emission that traces the outer disc.

A standard way to address this\nproblem is to apply Adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo (ASMC) methods, which\nconsist in exploiting the information given by the history of the sample to\ntune the parameters. This article is concerned with variance estimation in such\nASMC methods. Specifically, we focus on the case where the asymptotic variance\ncoincides with the one of the \"limiting\" Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm as\ndefined by Beskos et al. (2016). We prove that, under natural assumptions, the\nestimator introduced by Lee and Whiteley (2018) in the nonadaptive case (i.e.,\nSMC) is also a consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance for ASMC\nmethods.

Interpretation of experimental data in terms of\nparton distribution functions, generalized to describe transverse momentum and\nspatial parton distributions, is one of the main remaining challenges of modern\nnuclear physics. These new parton distribution and fragmentation functions\nencode the motion and the position of partons and are often referred to as\nthree-dimensional distributions describing the three-dimensional (3D) structure\nof the nucleon. Understanding of the production mechanism and performing\nphenomenological studies compatible with factorization theorems using minimal\nmodel assumptions are goals of analysis of the experimental data. HERMES and\nCOMPASS Collaborations and experiments at Jefferson Lab have collected a wealth\nof polarized and unpolarized Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS)\ndata. These data play a crucial role in current understanding of nucleon\nspin-phenomena as they cover a broad kinematical range. The Jefferson Lab 12\nGeV upgrade data on polarized and unpolarized SIDIS will have remarkably higher\nprecision at large parton fractional momentum $x$ compared to the existing\ndata. We argue that both experimental and phenomenological communities will\nbenefit from development of a comprehensive extraction framework that will\nfacilitate extraction of 3D nucleon structure, help understand various\nassumptions in extraction and data analysis, help to insure the model\nindependence of the experimental data and validate the extracted functions.

This paper addresses the crowd estimation problem and builds an\nIoT service to share the crowd estimation results across different systems. The\ncrowd estimation problem is to approximate the crowd size in a targeted area\nusing the observed information (e.g., Wi-Fi data). This paper exploits Wi-Fi\nprobe request packets (\"Wi-Fi probes\" for short) broadcasted by mobile devices\nto solve this problem. However, using only Wi-Fi probes to estimate the crowd\nsize may result in inaccurate results due to various environmental\nuncertainties which may lead to crowd overestimation or underestimation.\nMoreover, the ground-truth is unavailable because the coverage of Wi-Fi signals\nis time-varying and invisible. This paper introduces auxiliary sensors,\nstereoscopic cameras, to collect the near ground-truth at a specified\ncalibration choke point. Two calibration algorithms are proposed to solve the\ncrowd estimation problem. The key idea is to calibrate the Wi-Fi-only crowd\nestimation based on the correlations between the two types of data modalities.\nThen, to share the calibrated results across systems required by different\nstakeholders, our system is integrated with the FIWARE-based IoT platform. To\nverify the proposed system, we have launched an indoor pilot study in the\nWellington Railway Station and an outdoor pilot study in the Christchurch\nRe:START Mall in New Zealand.

However, current state-of-the-art Earth System Models do\nnot represent dynamic human societies and their feedback interactions with the\nbiogeophysical Earth system and macroeconomic Integrated Assessment Models\ntypically do so only with limited scope. This paper (i) proposes design\nprinciples for constructing World-Earth Models (WEM) for Earth system analysis\nof the Anthropocene, i.e., models of social (World) - ecological (Earth)\nco-evolution on up to planetary scales, and (ii) presents the copan:CORE open\nsimulation modeling framework for developing, composing and analyzing such WEMs\nbased on the proposed principles. The framework provides a modular structure to\nflexibly construct and study WEMs. These can contain biophysical (e.g. carbon\ncycle dynamics), socio-metabolic/economic (e.g. economic growth) and\nsocio-cultural processes (e.g. voting on climate policies or changing social\nnorms) and their feedback interactions, and are based on elementary entity\ntypes, e.g., grid cells and social systems. Thereby, copan:CORE enables the\nepistemic flexibility needed for contributions towards Earth system analysis of\nthe Anthropocene given the large diversity of competing theories and\nmethodologies used for describing socio-metabolic/economic and socio-cultural\nprocesses in the Earth system by various fields and schools of thought.

While these strategies were optimized for\nimproving validation accuracy, they also led to state-of-the-art results in\nsemi-supervised learning and improved robustness to common corruptions of\nimages. An obstacle to a large-scale adoption of these methods is a separate\nsearch phase which increases the training complexity and may substantially\nincrease the computational cost. Additionally, due to the separate search\nphase, these approaches are unable to adjust the regularization strength based\non model or dataset size. Automated augmentation policies are often found by\ntraining small models on small datasets and subsequently applied to train\nlarger models. In this work, we remove both of these obstacles. RandAugment has\na significantly reduced search space which allows it to be trained on the\ntarget task with no need for a separate proxy task. Furthermore, due to the\nparameterization, the regularization strength may be tailored to different\nmodel and dataset sizes. RandAugment can be used uniformly across different\ntasks and datasets and works out of the box, matching or surpassing all\nprevious automated augmentation approaches on CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, and ImageNet.\nOn the ImageNet dataset we achieve 85.0% accuracy, a 0.6% increase over the\nprevious state-of-the-art and 1.0% increase over baseline augmentation. On\nobject detection, RandAugment leads to 1.0-1.3% improvement over baseline\naugmentation, and is within 0.3% mAP of AutoAugment on COCO. Finally, due to\nits interpretable hyperparameter, RandAugment may be used to investigate the\nrole of data augmentation with varying model and dataset size.

We consider that\nthe agent's private information, referred to as state, evolves over time. The\nagent makes decisions of whether to stop or continue and what to report at each\nperiod. The principal, on the other hand, chooses decision rules consisting of\nan allocation rule and a set of payment rules to maximize her ex-ante expected\npayoff. In order to influence the agent's stopping decision, one of the\nterminal payment rules is posted-price, i.e., it depends only on the realized\nstopping time of the agent. We define the incentive compatibility in this\ndynamic environment in terms of Bellman equations, which is then simplified by\nestablishing a one-shot deviation principle. Given the optimality of the\nstopping rule, a sufficient condition for incentive compatibility is obtained\nby constructing the state-dependent payment rules in terms of a set of\nfunctions parameterized by the allocation rule. A necessary condition is\nderived from envelope theorem, which explicitly formulates the state-dependent\npayment rules in terms of allocation rules. A class of monotone environment is\nconsidered to characterize the optimal stopping by a threshold rule. The\nposted-price payment rules are then pinned down in terms of the allocation rule\nand the threshold function up to a constant. The incentive compatibility\nconstraints restrict the design of the posted-price payment rule by a regular\ncondition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 14:05:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 16:20:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 02:45:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 07:19:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-10"}

Its heterogeneous nature, as well as\ncombination of numerical and categorical attributes does not allow to apply the\nexisting data mining methods directly on the data without feature\npreprocessing. Therefore, a rather computationally expensive conversion of\ncategorical attributes into vector space should be utilised for analysis of\nsuch data. However, a well-known k-modes algorithm allows to cluster the\ncategorical data directly and avoid conversion into the vector space. The\nexisting implementations of k-modes for Big Data processing are ensemble-based\nand utilise two-step clustering, where data subsets are first clustered\nindependently, whereas the resulting cluster modes are clustered again in order\nto calculate metamodes valid for all data subsets. In this paper, the novel\nfrequency-based distance function is proposed for the second step of\nensemble-based k-modes clustering. Besides this, the existing feature\ndiscretisation method from the previous work is utilised in order to adapt\nk-modes for processing of mixed data sets. The resulting k-metamodes algorithm\nwas tested on two public security data sets and reached higher effectiveness in\ncomparison with the previous work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 14:05:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

The improved performance is due to Dante\nmaking forecasts, especially short-term forecasts, more confidently and\naccurately than DBM, suggesting Dante's improved forecast scores will also\ntranslate to more useful forecasts for the public health sector. Dante\nparticipated in the prospective 2018/19 FluSight challenge hosted by the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention and placed 1st in both the national\nand regional competition and the state competition. The methodology\nunderpinning Dante can be used in other disease forecasting contexts where\nnested geographic scales of interest exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 14:57:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

In the model presented here it is assumed that the solid can be\nrepresented as an homogeneous medium, with its thermophysical properties\ndepending on the temperature. The impingement freezing model is conceived to be\nvalid for highly processed vegetarians products or meat such as sausages, mince\nor ham freezing.

We build on\nand further develop an idea proposed by Gelman and Carlin (2014) termed\n\"prospective and retrospective design analysis\". Rather than focusing only on\nthe statistical significance of a result and on the classical control of type I\nand type II errors, a comprehensive design analysis involves reasoning about\nwhat can be considered a plausible effect size. Furthermore, it introduces two\nrelevant inferential risks: the exaggeration ratio or Type M error (i.e., the\npredictable average overestimation of an effect that emerges as statistically\nsignificant), and the sign error or Type S error (i.e., the risk that a\nstatistically significant effect is estimated in the wrong direction). Another\nimportant aspect of design analysis is that it can be usefully carried out both\nin the planning phase of a study and for the evaluation of studies that have\nalready been conducted, thus increasing researchers' awareness during all\nphases of a research project. We use a familiar example in psychology where the\nresearcher is interested in analyzing the differences between two independent\ngroups. We examine the case in which the plausible effect size is formalized as\na single value, and propose a method in which uncertainty concerning the\nmagnitude of the effect is formalized via probability distributions. Through\nseveral examples, we show that even though a design analysis requires big\neffort, it has the potential to contribute to planning more robust and\nreplicable studies.

Exploiting the\nidea that an object (and most of the stuff given context) should be labeled\nconsistently regardless of its location, we generate spatially independent and\nsemantically consistent (SISC) pseudo-labels by segmenting multiple sub-images\nusing base model and designing an aggregation strategy.

Thus helping\nlatent space learn the representation even when there are very few pixels\nbelonging to the domain category (small object for example) compared to rest of\nthe image. Our multi-level Self-supervised learning (MLSL) outperforms existing\nstate-of art (self or adversarial learning) algorithms.

Hamiltonians are the main tool for modelling the continuous time\nevolution of systems with conserved quantities, and they come equipped with\nmany useful properties, like time reversibility and smooth interpolation in\ntime. These properties are important for many machine learning problems - from\nsequence prediction to reinforcement learning and density modelling - but are\nnot typically provided out of the box by standard tools such as recurrent\nneural networks. In this paper, we introduce the Hamiltonian Generative Network\n(HGN), the first approach capable of consistently learning Hamiltonian dynamics\nfrom high-dimensional observations (such as images) without restrictive domain\nassumptions. Once trained, we can use HGN to sample new trajectories, perform\nrollouts both forward and backward in time and even speed up or slow down the\nlearned dynamics. We demonstrate how a simple modification of the network\narchitecture turns HGN into a powerful normalising flow model, called Neural\nHamiltonian Flow (NHF), that uses Hamiltonian dynamics to model expressive\ndensities. We hope that our work serves as a first practical demonstration of\nthe value that the Hamiltonian formalism can bring to deep learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 15:32:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 12:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-17"}

For\nexample, the vulnerability of individual system components can be described\nusing multiple factors, such as complexity, technological maturity, and the\navailability of tools to aid an attack. Such information is useful for\ndetermining attack risk, but much of it is challenging to acquire automatically\nand instead must be collected through expert assessments. However, most experts\ninherently carry some degree of uncertainty in their assessments. For example,\nit is impossible to be certain precisely how many tools are available to aid an\nattack. Traditional methods of capturing subjective judgements through choices\nsuch as \\emph{high}, \\emph{medium} or \\emph{low} do not enable experts to\nquantify their uncertainty. However, it is important to measure the range of\nuncertainty surrounding responses in order to appropriately inform system\nvulnerability analysis. We use a recently introduced interval-valued\nresponse-format to capture uncertainty in experts' judgements and employ\ninferential statistical approaches to analyse the data. We identify key\nattributes that contribute to hop vulnerability in cyber-systems and\ndemonstrate the value of capturing the uncertainty around these attributes. We\nfind that this uncertainty is not only predictive of uncertainty in the overall\nvulnerability of a given system component, but also significantly informs\nratings of overall component vulnerability itself. We propose that these\nmethods and associated insights can be employed in real world situations,\nincluding vulnerability assessments of cyber-physical systems, which are\nbecoming increasingly complex and integrated into society, making them\nparticularly susceptible to uncertainty in assessment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 14:36:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-03"}

The relativistic correction to the Fowler-Nordheim equation makes\nit possible to take into account the influence of the relativism on the field\nemission current. It is especially noted that the consideration of this\ncorrection is necessary in the case of sufficiently strong electric fields and\nrelatively large interelectrode distances. It should be stressed that this\ncorrection is valid for fixed interelectrode distances that decrease with\nincreasing electric field strength. It means that for the electric field\nstrength of 0.1 to 1 GV/m the interelectrode distance should not exceed values\nof 1 to 0.1 cm. First in the article it is spoken in detail about finding of\nthe electron wave function. Next the field emission current calculations are\ngiven.

The aim of this study is to focus on a\ncyber security eco-system, which was self-occurred within the interactive\neducational environment designed under the scope of TUBITAK 4004 Nature\nEducation and Science Schools Projects (with the name of A Cyber Security\nAdventure) with the use of important technologies such as virtual reality,\naugmented reality, and artificial intelligence. The eco-system occurred within\nthe interactive educational process where high school students took place\ncaused both students and the project team to experience an indirect social\nexperiment environment. In this sense, it is thought that the findings and\ncomments presented in the study will give important ideas to everyone involved\nin cyber security education, life-long learning processes, and the technology\nuse in software oriented educational tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2019 22:04:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-17"}

The tunneling probability and the Hawking temperature of the spin-1/2\nparticles of the BTZ black hole are investigated using modified Dirac equation\nbased on the GUP. The modified Hawking temperature for fermion crossing the\nback hole horizon includes the mass parameter of the black hole, angular\nmomentum, energy and also outgoing mass of the emitted particle. Besides,\nconsidering the effect of GUP into account, the modified Hawking radiation of\nmassless particle from a BTZ black hole is investigated using Damour and\nRuffini method, tortoise coordinate transformation and modified Klein-Gordon\nequation. The relation between the modified Hawking temperature obtained by\nusing Damour-Ruffini method and the energy of the emitted particle is derived.\nThe original Hawking temperature is also recovered in the absence of quantum\ngravity effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 07:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}
