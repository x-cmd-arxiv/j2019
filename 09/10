Within recent\nyears, a selection of studies have reported that individuals could be perfectly\nidentified based on their driving behavior under controlled conditions.\nHowever, research investigating the potential of driver identification under\nnaturalistic conditions claim accuracies only marginally higher than random\nguess. The paper at hand provides a comprehensive summary of the recent work,\nhighlighting the main discrepancies in the design of the machine learning\napproaches, primarily the window length parameter that was considered. Key\nfindings further indicate that the longitudinal vehicle control information is\nparticularly useful for driver identification, leaving the research gap on the\nextent to which the lateral vehicle control can be used for reliable\nidentification. Building upon existing work, we provide a novel approach for\nthe design of the window length parameter that provides evidence that reliable\ndriver identification can be achieved with data limited to the steering wheel\nonly. The results and insights in this paper are based on data collected from\nthe largest naturalistic driving study conducted in this field. Overall, a\nneural network based on GRUs was found to provide better identification\nperformance than traditional methods, increasing the prediction accuracy from\nunder 15\\% to over 65\\% for 15 drivers. When leveraging the full field study\ndataset, comprising 72 drivers, the accuracy of identification prediction of\nthe approach improved a random guess approach by a factor of 25.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 16:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

It was assumed that such density profiles are generated by star\nscattering by clumps, waves, or other inhomogeneities. Here we generalize these\nmodels to self-gravitating discs. The cylindrically symmetric Poisson equation\nimposes strong constraints. Scattering processes favor smoothness, so the\nsmoothest solutions, which minimize entropy gradients, are preferred. In the\ncase of self-gravitating discs (e.g., inner discs), the gravity, surface\ndensity and radial velocity dispersion in these smoothest models are all of the\nform 1/r times an exponential. When vertical balance is included, the vertical\nvelocity dispersion squared has the same form as the surface density, and the\nscale height is constant. In combined self-gravitating plus halo gravity cases,\nthe radial dispersion has an additional power-law term. Nonetheless, the\nsurface density profile has the same form at all radii, without breaks,\nsatisfying the disc-halo conspiracy. The azimuthal velocity and velocity\ndispersions are smooth, though the former can have a distinct peak. In these\nmodels the vertical dispersion increases inwards, and scattering may mediate a\ntransition to a secular bulge. If halo gravity dominates vertically in the\nouter disc, it flares. The models suggest a correlation between disc mass and\nradial scale length. The combination of smoothness, simplicity, ability to\nmatch generic observational features and physical constraints is unique to\nthese models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 16:01:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 20:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-27"}

An alternative approach is to\ncalculate the model visibilities directly by summing over all the members of\nthe clean component list, which is a more accurate method that can also be much\nslower.

Our models\nlive on a one dimensional lattice and exhibit asymmetric butterfly velocities\nbetween the left and right spatial directions. This asymmetry is transparently\nunderstood in a free (non-interacting) limit of our model Hamiltonians, where\nthe butterfly speed can be understood in terms of quasiparticle velocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 16:58:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 17:17:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-27"}

Inspired by binary\nmatrix permutation theories and geometric segmentation, we developed a fast and\nefficient BMF approach called MEBF (Median Expansion for Boolean\nFactorization). Overall, MEBF adopted a heuristic approach to locate binary\npatterns presented as submatrices that are dense in 1's. At each iteration,\nMEBF permutates the rows and columns such that the permutated matrix is\napproximately Upper Triangular-Like (UTL) with so-called Simultaneous\nConsecutive-ones Property (SC1P).

The primary reason for this\nneglect is the fact that most studies of nuclear dynamics do not include the\ntensor force at all in their models. Indeed, only a few Skyrme parametrizations\nconsider the tensor interaction in parameter determination. With modern\nresearch facilities extending our ability to probe exotic nuclei, a correct\ndescription of nuclear dynamics and heavy-ion fusion is vital to both\nsupporting and leading experimental efforts.\n  [Method] Fusion cross sections are calculated using ion-ion potentials\ngenerated by the fully microscopic density-constrained time-dependent\nHartree-Fock (DC-TDHF) method with the complete Skyrme tensor interaction.\n  [Results] For light nuclei, the tensor force only slightly changes the\nsub-barrier fusion cross sections at very low energies. Heavier nuclei,\nhowever, begin to exhibit a substantial hindrance effect in the sub-barrier\nregion. This effect is strongest in spin-unsaturated systems, though can\nmanifest in other configurations as well. Static, ground state deformation\neffects of the tensor force can also affect cross sections by shifting the\nfusion barrier.\n  [Conclusions] The tensor interaction has a measurable effect on the fusion\ncross sections of nuclei spanning the nuclear chart. The effect comes from both\nstatic effects present in the ground state and dynamic processes arising from\nthe time evolution of the system. This motivates the development of a modern\nSkyrme parameter set that includes all time-odd and tensor terms and that\nstudies moving forward should include the tensor force to ensure a more robust\nand complete description of nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 17:35:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

However, the effects of\npre-training and the differences caused by pre-training are still not fully\nunderstood. In this paper, we analyze the eigenspectrum dynamics of the\ncovariance matrix of each feature map in object detectors. Based on our\nanalysis on ResNet-50, Faster R-CNN with FPN, and Mask R-CNN, we show that\nobject detectors trained from ImageNet pre-trained models and those trained\nfrom scratch behave differently from each other even if both object detectors\nhave similar accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a method for automatically\ndetermining the widths (the numbers of channels) of object detectors based on\nthe eigenspectrum. We train Faster R-CNN with FPN from randomly initialized\nweights, and show that our method can reduce ~27% of the parameters of\nResNet-50 without increasing Multiply-Accumulate operations and losing\naccuracy.

We show that\nthe abundance of these galaxies is correlated with the assembly history of the\nhost halo: at fixed mass, haloes assembled earlier contain, on average, more\nultrafaint satellites today than haloes assembled later.

Given their rich merger histories, spheroids typically\nexhibit large fractions of `ex-situ' stellar mass, i.e. mass that is accreted,\nvia mergers, from external objects. This is particularly true for the most\nmassive galaxies, whose stellar masses typically cannot be attained without a\nlarge number of mergers.

To this end we analyse a sample of 1162 local,\nstar-forming galaxies from the galaxy survey Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO\n(MaNGA). Generally, both parameters do not show any significant dependence on\nenvironment. However, in agreement with previous studies, we find that low-mass\nsatellite galaxies are an exception to this rule. The gas metallicity in these\nobjects increases while their {\\Sigma}SFR decreases slightly with environmental\ndensity. The present analysis of MaNGA data allows us to extend this to\nspatially resolved properties. Our study reveals that the gas metallicity\ngradients of low-mass satellites flatten and their {\\Sigma}SFR gradients\nsteepen with increasing environmental density. By extensively exploring a\nchemical evolution model, we identify two scenarios that are able to explain\nthis pattern: metal-enriched gas accretion or pristine gas inflow with varying\naccretion timescales. The latter scenario better matches the observed\n{\\Sigma}SFR gradients, and is therefore our preferred solution. In this model,\na shorter gas accretion timescale at larger radii is required. This suggests\nthat 'outside-in quenching' governs the star formation processes of low-mass\nsatellite galaxies in dense environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

However, ~80% of stars still\nexhibit a NIR excess, suggesting that significant circumstellar mass remains.\nThis `proplyd lifetime problem' has persisted since the discovery of\nphotoevaporating discs in the core of the ONC by O'Dell & Wen (1994). In this\nwork, we demonstrate how an extended period of star formation can solve this\nproblem. Coupling N-body calculations and a viscous disc evolution model, we\nobtain high disc fractions at the present day. This is partly due to the\nmigration of older stars outwards, and younger stars inwards such that the most\nstrongly irradiated PPDs are also the youngest. We show how the disc mass\ndistribution can be used to test the recent claims in the literature for\nmultiple stellar populations in the ONC. Our model also explains the recent\nfinding that host mass and PPD mass are only weakly correlated, in contrast\nwith other regions of similar age. We conclude that the status of the ONC as\nthe archetype for understanding the influence of environment on planet\nformation is undeserved; the complex star formation history (involving star\nformation episodes within ~0.8 Myr of the present day) results in confusing\nsignatures in the PPD population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 18:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Previous model predictions, while\naccurate, are based on a highly idealized initial stress distribution and a\nsimple velocity-dependent expression for friction. The full scope of the model\nhas, therefore, not been fully demonstrated. Further developments, presented\nhere, include more physically realistic treatments of both the initial\nconditions and friction. Model predictions are: (1) The type of a seismic\nevent, i.e. regular EQ or SSE, is determined by the fault strength, the shear\nto normal stress ratio, and the gradient in the ratio. Quantitative values for\nthese crucial parameters are also obtained here; (2) Rupture velocities for\nregular EQs range from a fraction of the shear wave velocity up to the\nsupershear velocity. The maximum slip velocity for regular EQs is typically on\nthe order of 1 m/s. For SSEs, the slip velocity ranges widely from a few\ncm/year up to 0.1 m/s. The magnitude of the stress drop may vary in the range\nfrom 1% to 10% of the initial shear stress for regular EQs and from 0.1% to 10%\nfor the SSEs; (3) The rupture can expend as a crack-like mode or as a\nself-healing pulse mode. The type of rupture mode is determined by the stress\nratio and its gradient. If stress heterogeneity has a step-like shape, the\nrupture is always crack-like. If the heterogeneity is localized, the rupture is\ncrack-like for sufficiently large values of the stress and its gradient and is\npulse-like for smaller values; (4) After an instability develops, rupture\ndynamics do not depend on the relative values of the rate-state a and b\nparameters, i.e., it does not matter if frictional sliding is\nvelocity-weakening or velocity-strengthening. Models based on the rate-state\nare not consistent with this result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 19:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

These models are more complete descriptions of\nthe plasma than reduced models like magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) since they\nnaturally retain non-ideal effects like electron inertia, Hall term, pressure\nanisotropy/nongyrotropy, etc. One obstacle to broader application of these\nmodel is that an explicit treatment of their source terms leads to the need to\nresolve rapid kinetic processes like plasma oscillation and electron cyclotron\nmotion, even when they are not important. In this paper, we suggest two ways to\naddress this issue. First, we derive the analytic forms solutions to the source\nupdate equations, which can be implemented as a practical, but less generic\nsolver. We then develop a time-centered, locally implicit algorithm to update\nthe source terms, allowing stepping over the fast kinetic time-scales. For a\nplasma with $S$ species, the locally implict algorithm involves inverting a\nlocal $3S+3$ matrix only, thus is very efficient. The performance can be\nfurther elevated by using the direct update formulas to skip null calculations.\nBenchmarks illustrated the exact energy-conservation of the locally implicit\nsolver, as well as its efficiency and robustness for both small-scale,\nidealized problems and large-scale, complex systems.

This, however, imposes privacy risks. Some prior arts\nproposed sending the features extracted from raw data to the cloud.\nUnfortunately, these extracted features can still be exploited by attackers to\nrecover raw images and to infer embedded private attributes.

This is done while retaining useful information for the\nintended cloud service. DeepObfuscator includes a learnable obfuscator that is\ndesigned to hide privacy-related sensitive information from the features by\nperforming our proposed adversarial training algorithm.

Upper and lower bounds on the minimal and Jones\nindices of Yang-Baxter endomorphisms are derived, and a full characterization\nof R-matrices defining ergodic endomorphisms is given.\n  As examples, so-called simple R-matrices are discussed in any dimension $d$,\nand the set of all Yang-Baxter endomorphisms in $d=2$ is completely analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 20:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

However, non-standard pre-BBN cosmologies based on alternative assumptions\ncould arise in motivated theoretical models and are equally in agreement with\nall existing data. We revisit the production of sterile neutrinos of mass 0.01\neV to 1 MeV in two examples of such models: scalar-tensor and low reheating\ntemperature pre-BBN cosmologies. In both of them, the putative 3.5 keV X-ray\nsignal line corresponds to a sterile neutrino with a mixing large enough to be\ntested in upcoming laboratory experiments. Additionally, the\ncosmological/astrophysical upper limits on active-sterile neutrino mixings are\nsignificantly weaker than in the standard pre-BBN cosmology, which shows that\nthese limits are not robust. For example, in the scalar-tensor case the\npotential signal regions implied by the LSND and MiniBooNE short-baseline as\nwell as the DANSS and NEOS reactor experiments are entirely not bound by\ncosmological restrictions.

First, I performed the long-term (decadal scales) ensemble simulation\nof the LSM, in which each ensemble member has different parameters' values, and\ncalculated the gap between simulation and observation, or the cost function,\nfor each ensemble member.

The objective function of this optimization is multimodal and has\ndiscontinuous slope, and is hence difficult for univariate optimizers to solve.\nWe demonstrate a novel procedure for efficiently calculating these optima for\ntwo of our distance measure variants. We present numerical experiments\ndemonstrating that (a) upper bounds of our distance metrics can be used to\ndistinguish between lineages of related graphs; (b) our procedure is faster at\nfinding the required optima, by as much as a factor of 10^3; and (c) the upper\nbounds satisfy the triangle inequality exactly under some assumptions and\napproximately under others. We also derive an upper bound for the distance\nbetween two graph products, in terms of the distance between the two pairs of\nfactors. Additionally, we present several possible applications, including the\nconstruction of infinite \"graph limits\" by means of Cauchy sequences of graphs\nrelated to one another by our distance measure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:17:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

In this paper,\nwe analyze a series of high-resolution simulations to examine the energetics\nand turbulence of the medium under SNe Ia. We find that when SN remnants are\nresolved, their effects differ distinctly from a volumetric heating term, as is\ncommonly assumed in unresolved simulations. First, the net heating is\nsignificantly higher than expected, by 30$\\pm$10\\% per cooling time. This is\nbecause a large fraction of the medium is pushed into lower densities which\ncool inefficiently. Second, the medium is turbulent; the root-mean-squared\n(RMS) velocity of the gas to 20-50 km s$^{-1}$ on a driving scale of tens of\nparsec. The velocity field of the medium is dominated by compressional modes,\nwhich are larger than the solenoidal components by a factor of 3-7. Third, the\nhot gas has a very broad density distribution. The ratio between the density\nfluctuations and the RMS Mach number, parameterized as $b$, is 2-20. This is in\ncontrast to previous simulations of turbulent media, which have found\n$b\\lesssim$ 1. The reason for the difference is mainly caused by the\n\\textit{localized} heating of SNe Ia, which creates a large density contrast.\nLast, the typical length scale of a density fluctuation grows with time,\nforming increasingly larger bubbles and filamentary ridges. These underlying\ndensity fluctuations need to be included when X-ray observations are\ninterpreted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:25:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 19:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

Such schemes are often more efficient in\nterms of size, power, and cost, over using distinct radar and communication\nsystems. Since these functionalities share resources such as spectrum, power,\nand antennas, DFRC methods typically entail some degradation in both radar and\ncommunication performance. In this work we propose a DFRC scheme based on the\ncarrier agile phased array radar (CAESAR), which combines frequency and spatial\nagility. The proposed DFRC system, referred to as multi-carrier agile joint\nradar communication (MAJoRCom), exploits the inherent spatial and spectral\nrandomness of CAESAR to convey digital messages in the form of index\nmodulation. The resulting communication scheme naturally coexists with the\nradar functionality, and thus does not come at the cost of reduced radar\nperformance. We analyze the performance of MAJoRCom, quantifying its achievable\nbit rate. In addition, we develop a low complexity decoder and a codebook\ndesign approach, which simplify the recovery of the communicated bits. Our\nnumerical results demonstrate that MAJoRCom is capable of achieving a bit rate\nwhich is comparable to utilizing independent communication modules without\naffecting the radar performance, and that our proposed low-complexity decoder\nallows the receiver to reliably recover the transmitted symbols with an\naffordable computational burden.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 01:20:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we collected approximately 180\nopen-ended responses to several question stems from the Cybersecurity Concept\nInventory of the Cybersecurity Assessment Tools Project and from the Digital\nLogic Concept Inventory. We generated preliminary distractors by filtering\nresponses, grouping similar responses, selecting the four most frequent groups,\nand refining a representative distractor for each of these groups.

We concretize\nsimilarity between temporal tasks through a notion of logical transferability,\nand develop a transfer learning approach between different yet similar temporal\ntasks. We first propose an inference technique to extract metric interval\ntemporal logic (MITL) formulas in sequential disjunctive normal form from\nlabeled trajectories collected in RL of the two tasks. If logical\ntransferability is identified through this inference, we construct a timed\nautomaton for each sequential conjunctive subformula of the inferred MITL\nformulas from both tasks. We perform RL on the extended state which includes\nthe locations and clock valuations of the timed automata for the source task.\nWe then establish mappings between the corresponding components (clocks,\nlocations, etc.) of the timed automata from the two tasks, and transfer the\nextended Q-functions based on the established mappings. Finally, we perform RL\non the extended state for the target task, starting with the transferred\nextended Q-functions. Our results in two case studies show, depending on how\nsimilar the source task and the target task are, that the sampling efficiency\nfor the target task can be improved by up to one order of magnitude by\nperforming RL in the extended state space, and further improved by up to\nanother order of magnitude using the transferred extended Q-functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 03:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

Prior work typically solves this\ntask in the extract-then-classify or unified labeling manner. However, these\nmethods either suffer from the redundant entity pairs, or ignore the important\ninner structure in the process of extracting entities and relations. To address\nthese limitations, in this paper, we first decompose the joint extraction task\ninto two interrelated subtasks, namely HE extraction and TER extraction. The\nformer subtask is to distinguish all head-entities that may be involved with\ntarget relations, and the latter is to identify corresponding tail-entities and\nrelations for each extracted head-entity. Next, these two subtasks are further\ndeconstructed into several sequence labeling problems based on our proposed\nspan-based tagging scheme, which are conveniently solved by a hierarchical\nboundary tagger and a multi-span decoding algorithm.

This\ninsulator becomes metallic by removal of a tiny fraction of its oxygen atoms.\nHere, we present a detailed study of low-temperature charge transport in\nSr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$TiO$_{3-\\delta}$, documenting the evolution of resistivity with\nincreasing carrier concentration ($n$). Below a threshold carrier\nconcentration, $n^*(x)$, the polar structural phase transition has a clear\nsignature in resistivity and Ca substitution significantly reduces the 2 K\nmobility at a given carrier density. For three different Ca concentrations, we\nfind that the phase transition fades away when one mobile electron is\nintroduced for about $7.9\\pm0.6$ dipoles.

By introducing the concept of geometric field curvature\nfor any field trajectory in the parameter space we are able to unveil\nunderlying patterns in the overall quantum behavior: the knowledge of the field\ncurvature provides a non-standard and fresh access to the interrelation between\nfield and spin trajectories, and the corresponding quantum phases acquired in\nnon-adiabatic cyclic evolutions. In this context, we single out setups in which\nthe driving field curvature can be employed to demonstrate a pure geometric\ncontrol of the quantum phases. Furthermore, the driving field curvature can be\nnaturally exploited to introduce the geometrical torque and derive a general\nexpression for the total quantum phase acquired in a cycle. Remarkably, such\nrelation allows to access the mechanisms controlling the changeover of the\nquantum phase across a topological transition and to disentangle the role of\nthe spin and field topological windings. As for implementations, we discuss a\nseries of physical systems and platforms to demonstrate how the geometric\ncontrol of the quantum phases can be realized for pendular field drivings.

Accounting for the\nmulti-seasonal patterns becomes necessary to generate more accurate and\nmeaningful forecasts in these contexts. In this paper, we propose Long\nShort-Term Memory Multi-Seasonal Net (LSTM-MSNet), a decomposition based,\nunified prediction framework to forecast time series with multiple seasonal\npatterns. The current state of the art in this space are typically univariate\nmethods, in which the model parameters of each time series are estimated\nindependently. Consequently, these models are unable to include key patterns\nand structures that may be shared by a collection of time series. In contrast,\nLSTM-MSNet is a globally trained Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), where a\nsingle prediction model is built across all the available time series to\nexploit the cross series knowledge in a group of related time series.\nFurthermore, our methodology combines a series of state-of-the-art\nmultiseasonal decomposition techniques to supplement the LSTM learning\nprocedure. In our experiments, we are able to show that on datasets from\ndisparate data sources, like e.g. the popular M4 forecasting competition, a\ndecomposition step is beneficial, whereas in the common real-world situation of\nhomogeneous series from a single application, exogenous seasonal variables or\nno seasonal preprocessing at all are better choices.

Saturation magnetization\n($M_{\\rm s}$) peaks of 110 mT and uniaxial PMA energy densities ($K_{\\rm u}$)\nof 0.1 MJ/m$^3$ were obtained for a N$_2$ gas flow ratio ($Q$) of $\\sim 10 \\%$\nduring sputtering deposition, suggesting nearly single-phase crystalline\n$\\epsilon$-Mn$_4$N. Segregation of $\\alpha$-Mn and nitrogen-deficient Mn$_4$N\ngrains was observed for $Q \\approx 6\\%$, which was responsible for a decrease\nin the $M_{\\rm s}$ and $K_{\\rm u}$. The first-principles calculations revealed\nthat the magnetic structure of Mn$_4$N showing PMA was \"type-B\" having a\ncollinear structure, whose magnetic moments couple parallel within the c-plane\nand alternating along the c-direction. In addition, the $K_{\\rm u}$ calculated\nusing Mn$_{32}$N$_x$ supercells showed a strong dependence on nitrogen\ndeficiency, in qualitative agreement with the experimental results. The\nsecond-order perturbation analysis of $K_{\\rm u}$ with respect to the\nspin-orbit interaction revealed that not only spin-conserving but also\nspin-flip processes contribute significantly to the PMA in Mn$_4$N. We also\nfound that both contributions decreased with increasing nitrogen deficiency,\nresulting in the reduction of $K_{\\rm u}$. It was noted that the decrease in\nthe spin-flip contribution occurred at the Mn atoms in face-centered sites.\nThis is one of the specific PMA characteristics we found for\nantiperovskite-type Mn$_4$N.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 06:12:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 00:25:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2020 23:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-17"}

Relation networks (RNs), a kind of architectures for relational\nreasoning, can acquire a deep metric ability for images by just being designed\nas a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) [23].

Westerlund\n1 is an ideal astrophysical laboratory in which to study massive stars and\ntheir winds in great detail over a large range of different evolutionary\nphases. Aims: We aim to study the radio emission from Westerlund 1, in order to\nmeasure radio fluxes from the population of massive stars, and determine\nmass-loss rates and spectral indices where possible. Methods: Observations were\ncarried out in 2015 and 2016 with the Australia telescope compact array (ATCA)\nat 5.5 and 9 GHz using multiple configurations, with maximum baselines ranging\nfrom 750m to 6km. Results: 30 stars were detected in the radio from the fully\nconcatenated dataset, 10 of which were WRs (predominantly late type WN stars),\n5 YHGs, 4 RSGs, 1 LBV star, the sgB[e] star W9, and several O and B\nsupergiants.

If test samples can be from training (seen) as\nwell as unseen classes, it is a more challenging problem due to the existence\nof strong bias towards seen classes. This problem is generally known as\n\\emph{generalized} zero-shot learning (GZSL). Thanks to the recent advances in\ngenerative models such as VAEs and GANs, sample synthesis based approaches have\ngained considerable attention for solving this problem. These approaches are\nable to handle the problem of class bias by synthesizing unseen class samples.\nHowever, these ZSL/GZSL models suffer due to the following key limitations:\n$(i)$ Their training stage learns a class-conditioned generator using only\n\\emph{seen} class data and the training stage does not \\emph{explicitly} learn\nto generate the unseen class samples; $(ii)$ They do not learn a generic\noptimal parameter which can easily generalize for both seen and unseen class\ngeneration; and $(iii)$ If we only have access to a very few samples per seen\nclass, these models tend to perform poorly.

Although recent methods have\nattempted to fill the gap with deep generative networks, most of them suffer\nfrom the inevitable misalignment between different face modalities. Instead of\nimaging sensors, the misalignment primarily results from facial geometric\nvariations that are independent of the spectrum. Rather than building a\nmonolithic but complex structure, this paper proposes a Pose Aligned\nCross-spectral Hallucination (PACH) approach to disentangle the independent\nfactors and deal with them in individual stages. In the first stage, an\nUnsupervised Face Alignment (UFA) module is designed to align the facial shapes\nof the near-infrared (NIR) images with those of the visible (VIS) images in a\ngenerative way, where UV maps are effectively utilized as the shape guidance.\nThus the task of the second stage becomes spectrum translation with aligned\npaired data.

Recent studies\nshow that including stellar rotation can have a deep impact on nucleosynthesis.\nWe studied the evolution of Sr and Ba in the Milky Way. A chemical evolution\nmodel was employed to reproduce the Galactic enrichment. We tested two\ndifferent nucleosynthesis prescriptions for s-process in massive stars, adopted\nfrom the Geneva group and the Rome group. Rotation was taken into account,\nstudying the effects of stars without rotation or rotating with different\nvelocities. We also tested different production sites for the r-process:\nmagneto rotational driven supernovae and neutron star mergers. The evolution of\nthe abundances of Sr and Ba is well reproduced. The comparison with the most\nrecent observations shows that stellar rotation is a good assumption, but\nexcessive velocities result in overproduction of these elements. In particular,\nthe predicted evolution of the [Sr/Ba] ratio at low metallicity does not\nexplain the data at best if rotation is not included. Adopting different\nrotational velocities for different stellar mass and metallicity better\nexplains the observed trends. Despite the differences between the two sets of\nadopted stellar models, both show a better agreement with the data assuming an\nincrease of rotational velocity toward low metallicity. Assuming different\nr-process sources does not alter this conclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 09:58:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

These planets are too young and distant to have been formed via the\nCore Accretion (CA) scenario, and are much less massive than the gas clumps\nborn in the classical Gravitational Instability (GI) theory. It was recently\nsuggested that such planets may form by the partial destruction of GI\nprotoplanets: energy output due to the growth of a massive core may unbind all\nor most of the surrounding pre-collapse protoplanet. Here we present the first\n3D global disc simulations that simultaneously resolve grain dynamics in the\ndisc and within the protoplanet. We confirm that massive GI protoplanets may\nself-destruct at arbitrarily large separations from the host star provided that\nsolid cores of mass around 10-20 Earth masses are able to grow inside them\nduring their pre-collapse phase.

This leads to very complicated\ndust dynamics in the protoplanet centre, potentially resulting in the formation\nof multiple cores, planetary satellites, and other debris such as planetesimals\nwithin the same protoplanet. A unique prediction of this planet formation\nscenario is the presence of sub-Jovian planets at wide orbits in Class 0/I\nprotoplanetary discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 10:41:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

At much shorter (inner) time\nsteps, these forces are extrapolated on the basis of their outer values. The\nequations of motion are then solved using a multiple time step integration\nwithin an optimized isokinetic Nos\\'e-Hoover chain thermostat. The new approach\nis applied to molecular dynamics simulations of various systems consisting of\nsolvated organic and biomolecules of different complexity. Namely, we consider\nhydrated alanine dipeptide, asphaltene in toluene solvent, miniprotein 1L2Y and\nprotein G in aqueous solution. It is shown that in all these cases, the\nenhanced extrapolation provides much better accuracy of the solvation force\napproximation than the existing approaches. As a result, it can be used with\nmuch larger outer time steps, leading to a significant speedup of the\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 11:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Although most massive stars\nare found in binary systems, the effect, however, of binary interactions on the\nAl26 yields have not been investigated since Braun & Langer (1995). Here we aim\nto fill this gap. We have used the MESA stellar evolution code to compute\nmassive (10Msun<=M<=80Msun), non-rotating, single and binary stars of solar\nmetallicity (Z=0.014). We computed the wind yields for the single stars and for\nthe binary systems where mass transfer plays a major role. Depending on the\ninitial mass of the primary star and orbital period, the Al26 yield can either\nincrease or decrease in a binary system. For binary systems with primary masses\nup to ~35-40Msun, the yield can increase significantly, especially at the lower\nmass-end, while above ~45Msun the yield becomes similar to the single star\nyield or even decreases. Our preliminary results show that compared to\nsupernova explosions, the contribution of mass-loss in binary systems to the\ntotal Al26 abundance produced by a stellar population is minor. On the other\nhand, if massive star mass-loss is the origin of Al26 in the early Solar\nSystem, our results will have significant implications for the identification\nof the potential stellar, or stellar population, source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 12:26:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

However, an unavoidable obstacle for training such\nalgorithms is that annotated dialogue corpora are often unavailable. One of the\npopular approaches addressing this is to train a dialogue agent with a user\nsimulator. Traditional user simulators are built upon a set of dialogue rules\nand therefore lack response diversity. This severely limits the simulated cases\nfor agent training. Later data-driven user models work better in diversity but\nsuffer from data scarcity problem. To remedy this, we design a new corpus-free\nframework that taking advantage of their benefits. The framework builds a user\nsimulator by first generating diverse dialogue data from templates and then\nbuild a new State2Seq user simulator on the data. To enhance the performance,\nwe propose the State2Seq user simulator model to efficiently leverage dialogue\nstate and history. Experiment results on an open dataset show that our user\nsimulator helps agents achieve an improvement of 6.36% on success rate.\nState2Seq model outperforms the seq2seq baseline for 1.9 F-score.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 12:50:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

Findings from our model refute this, as we find that since the\nearly 2000s reallocation has consistently been negative, and that the Indian\nincome distribution has entered a regime of perverse redistribution of\nresources from the poor to the rich. Outcomes from the model indicate not only\nthat income shares of the bottom decile (~1%) and bottom percentile (~0.03%)\nare at historic lows, but also that real incomes of the bottom decile (-2.5%)\nand percentile (-6%) have declined in the 2000s.

Accordingly, CO-based gas masses and gas/dust ratios are\norders of magnitude lower than previously thought. This may be explained either\nas fast gas dispersal, or as chemical evolution and locking up of volatiles in\nlarger bodies leading to the low observed CO fluxes. The latter processes lead\nto enhanced C/O ratios in the gas, which may be reflected in enhanced\nabundances of molecules like C2H. The goal of this work is to employ C2H\nobservations to understand whether low CO fluxes are caused by volatile\ndepletion, or by fast gas dissipation. We present ALMA Cycle 4 C2H observations\nof a subsample of nine sources in Lupus. The integrated C2H emission is\ndetermined and compared to previous CO observations and model predictions.\nSeven out of nine disks are detected in C2H, whose line emission is almost as\nbright as 13CO. All detections are significantly brighter than the typical\nsensitivity of the observations, hinting at a bimodal distribution of the C2H\nline intensities. When compared with DALI models, the observed C2H fluxes can\nbe reproduced only if some level of volatile carbon and oxygen depletion is\nallowed and C/O>1 in the gas. Models with reduced gas/dust ratios fail instead\nto reproduce the observations. A steeper than linear correlation between C2H\nand CN emission line is found. This is linked to the fact that C2H emission\nlines are affected more strongly by C/O variations than CN lines. Ring-like\nstructures are detected both in C2H and in continuum emission but, as for CN,\nthey do not seem to be connected. Sz 71 shows ring shaped emission in both C2H\nand CN with the location of the peak intensity coinciding. Our new ALMA C2H\nobservations favour volatile carbon and oxygen depletion rather than fast gas\ndispersal to explain the faint CO observations for most of the disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 13:42:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 07:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

In classic mechanism design problems, we assume\nthat the jobs are controlled by selfish agents, with the sizes being their\nprivate information. Each job (agent) aims at minimizing its own cost, which is\nits completion time plus the payment charged by the mechanism. Truthful\nmechanisms guaranteeing that every job minimizes its cost by reporting its true\nsize have been well-studied [Aspnes et al. JACM 1997, Feldman et al.

However, pruning models with residual learning is more\nchallenging. In this paper, we introduce Variance-Aware Cross-Layer (VACL), a\nnovel approach to address this problem. VACL consists of two parts, a\nCross-Layer grouping and a Variance Aware regularization. In Cross-Layer\ngrouping the $i^{th}$ filters of layers connected by skip-connections are\ngrouped into one regularization group. Then, the Variance-Aware regularization\nterm takes into account both the first and second-order statistics of the\nconnected layers to constrain the variance within a group. Our approach can\neffectively improve the structural sparsity of residual models. For CIFAR10,\nthe proposed method reduces a ResNet model by up to 79.5% with no accuracy drop\nand reduces a ResNeXt model by up to 82% with less than 1% accuracy drop. For\nImageNet, it yields a pruned ratio of up to 63.3% with less than 1% top-5\naccuracy drop.

Most supersets of defective sets will also initiate\ncascades. This property was leveraged by Random Chemistry (RC), a\nstate-of-the-art algorithm for efficiently finding minimal defective sets.\nWhile not previously acknowledged as such, RC is a group-testing algorithm, in\nthat it tests pools of candidate solutions. RC then reduces the size of\ndefective pools until a minimal defective set is found. Using a synthetic model\nof the Western United States power grid, we show that run times are minimized\nwith a much smaller initial pool size than previously recommended, nearly\ndoubling the speed of RC. We compare RC to a proposed new alternative\ngroup-testing algorithm (SIGHT). Both algorithms have their advantages; while\nSIGHT is shown to require fewer total tests than RC, RC requires fewer tests of\ndefective sets. Thus, the relative speed of each algorithm depends on the\nrelative cost of defective vs. non defective tests, a factor not previously\nconsidered in the group-testing literature. In the power systems application,\ntests of defective sets are much more computationally costly, so RC is faster.\nHowever, with only a single control parameter (compared to many in RC), SIGHT\nis easier to optimize, and in applications where the cost ratio of\ndefective:non-defective tests is low enough, SIGHT will be faster than RC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 17:23:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

Steadily\ndecreasing phase-space volumes correspond to the dissipation associated with\nentropy production. Like three smooth reversible dissipative one-body\nphase-space flows developed in the 1980s and 1990s our maps generate fractal\ndistributions, but in two dimensions rather than three, simplifying\nvisualization and analyses. The continuity equation, which quantifies\nphase-volume loss, motivates study of the fractals' reduced ``information\ndimensions'', which were approximated by Kaplan and Yorke in terms of\ntwo-dimensional maps' two Lyapunov exponents. The maps studied here generate\nfractal (fractional dimensional) distributions in their phase spaces. By\nmapping uniformly dense grids of points, fractal dimensions can be determined\nby ``area-wise'' mappings. Beginning with a uniform grid area-wise mapping of\nthe $N2$ Baker Map provides an information dimension of 1.78969.

The code is applied to study the two\nfly-bys that occurred on system HD 106906, recently evidenced by De Rosa &\nKalas (2019), to determine if they could account for the wide orbit of the\nplanet. Thousands of simulations have been performed to account for the\nuncertainty on the perturbers coordinates and velocities. The algorithm is able\nto handle any change of hierarchy, temporary or not. We used it to fully model\nHD 106906 encounters. The simulations confirm that the fly-bys could have\nstabilized the planet orbit, and show that it can account for the planet\nprobable misalignment with respect to the disk plane as well as the disk\nmorphology. However, that requires a small distance at closest approach (< 0.05\npc), and this configuration is not guaranteed. ODEA is a very good choice for\nthe study of non-Solar type architecture. It can now adapt to an evolving\nhierarchy, and is thus suitable to study capture of planets and dust. Further\nobservations of the perturbers, in particular their radial velocity, are\nrequired to conclude on the effects of the fly-by on system HD 106906.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 14:49:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

Previous work has shown\nthat systematic errors in star catalogs can affect the accuracy of astrometric\nobservations. That, in turn, can influence the resulting orbit fits for minor\nplanets. In order to quantify these systematic errors, we compare the positions\nand proper motion of stellar sources in the most utilized star catalogs to the\nsecond release of the Gaia star catalog. The accuracy of Gaia astrometry allows\nus to unambiguously identify local biases and derive a scheme that can be used\nto correct past astrometric observations of solar system objects. Here we\nprovide a substantially improved debiasing scheme for 26 astrometric catalogs\nthat were extensively used in minor planet astrometry. Revised corrections near\nthe galactic center eliminate artifacts that could be traced back to reference\ncatalogs used in previous debiasing schemes. Median differences in stellar\npositions between catalogs now tend to be on the order of several tens of\nmilliarcseconds (mas) but can be as large as 175 mas. Median stellar proper\nmotion corrections scatter around 0.3 mas/yr and range from 1 to 4 mas/yr for\nstar catalogs with and without proper motion, respectively. The tables in this\nwork are meant to be applied to existing optical observations. They are not\nintended to correct new astrometric measurments as those should make use of the\nGaia astrometric catalog. Since previous debiasing schemes already reduced\nsystematics in past observations to a large extent, corrections beyond the\ncurrent work may not be needed in the foreseeable future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 15:10:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

Most recently, DNNs are attacked through Trojan which can\neffectively infect the model during the training phase and get activated only\nthrough specific input patterns (i.e, trigger) during inference. In this work,\nfor the first time, we propose a novel Targeted Bit Trojan(TBT) method, which\ncan insert a targeted neural Trojan into a DNN through the bit-flip attack. Our\nalgorithm efficiently generates a trigger specifically designed to locate\ncertain vulnerable bits of DNN weights stored in main memory (i.e., DRAM). The\nobjective is that once the attacker flips these vulnerable bits, the network\nstill operates with normal inference accuracy with benign input. However, when\nthe attacker activates the trigger by embedding it with any input, the network\nis forced to classify all inputs to a certain target class.

In each\ncompartment, another secret sharing scheme can be applied. Using the\nmodifications the overall complexity of general access structures realized\nthrough compartmented secret sharing schemes can be reduced. This improves the\ncomputational complexity.

Thus when\nmonitoring reactor activities by the observation of antineutrino emissions, one\nmust discriminate known background reactor fluxes from possible unknown reactor\nsignals under investigation. To quantify this discrimination, we find the\nconfidence to reject the (null) hypothesis of a single proximal reactor, by\nexploiting directional antineutrino signals in the presence of a second,\nunknown reactor. In particular, we simulate the inverse beta decay (IBD)\nresponse of a detector filled with a 1 kT fiducial mass of Gadolinium-doped\nliquid scintillator in mineral oil. We base the detector geometry on that of\nWATCHMAN, an upcoming antineutrino monitoring experiment soon to be deployed at\nthe Boulby mine in the United Kingdom whose design and deployment will be\ndetailed in a forthcoming white paper. From this simulation, we construct an\nanalytical model of the IBD event distribution for the case of one $4\\mathrm{\\\nGWt}\\pm2\\%$ reactor 25 km away from the detector site, and for an additional,\nunknown, 35 MWt reactor 3 to 5 km away. The effects of natural-background\nrejection cuts are approximated. Applying the model, we predict $3\\sigma$\nconfidence to detect the presence of an unknown reactor within five weeks, at\nstandoffs of 3 km or nearer. For more distant unknown reactors, the $3\\sigma$\ndetection time increases significantly. However, the relative significance of\ndirectional sensitivity also increases, providing up to an eight week speedup\nto detect an unknown reactor at 5 km away. Therefore, directionally sensitive\nantineutrino monitoring can accelerate the mid-field detection of unknown\nreactors whose operation might otherwise be masked by more powerful reactors in\nthe vicinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 04:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-13"}

Whether living conditions in\nIndian urban slums constitute a path to human development or a poverty trap is\ntherefore an issue of vital importance. Here, we characterize census data using\nthe framework of urban scaling to systematically characterize the relative\nproperties of Indian urban slums, focusing on attributes of neighborhoods such\nas access to basic services like water, sanitation, and electrical power.

We present advances on these two aspects in the\ncase of general random non-autonomous second order linear differential\nequations with analytic data processes. The Fr\\\"obenius method is employed to\nobtain the stochastic solution in the form of a mean square convergent power\nseries.

A Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Network (DenseNet)\nwas trained on a subset of the bounding box images, and its performance\nevaluated on a held out test set and by comparison on a 100-image subset to two\ngroups of human observers: fellowship-trained radiologists and orthopaedists,\nand senior residents in emergency medicine, radiology, and orthopaedics.\nResults: The binary accuracy for fracture of our model was 93.8% (95% CI,\n91.3-95.8%), with sensitivity of 92.7% (95% CI, 88.7-95.6%), and specificity\n95.0% (95% CI, 91.5-97.3%). Multiclass classification accuracy was 90.4% (95%\nCI, 87.4-92.9%). When compared to human observers, our model achieved at least\nexpert-level classification under all conditions. Additionally, when the model\nwas used as an aid, human performance improved, with aided resident performance\napproximating unaided fellowship-trained expert performance. Conclusions: Our\ndeep learning model identified and classified hip fractures with at least\nexpert-level accuracy, and when used as an aid improved human performance, with\naided resident performance approximating that of unaided fellowship-trained\nattendings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 15:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-16"}

A path\nin $G$ is called a $T$-path if its ends are distinct vertices in $T$ and no\ninternal vertices belong to $T$. In 1978, Mader showed a characterization of\nthe maximum number of edge-disjoint $T$-paths.\n  In this paper, we provide a combinatorial, deterministic algorithm for\nfinding the maximum number of edge-disjoint $T$-paths. The algorithm adopts an\naugmenting path approach. More specifically, we utilize a new concept of short\naugmenting walks in auxiliary labeled graphs to capture a possible augmentation\nof the number of edge-disjoint $T$-paths. To design a search procedure for a\nshort augmenting walk, we introduce blossoms analogously to the matching\nalgorithm of Edmonds (1965). When the search procedure terminates without\nfinding a short augmenting walk, the algorithm provides a certificate for the\noptimality of the current edge-disjoint $T$-paths. From this certificate, one\ncan obtain the Edmonds--Gallai type decomposition introduced by Seb\\H{o} and\nSzeg\\H{o} (2004). The algorithm runs in $O(|E|^2)$ time, which is much faster\nthan the best known deterministic algorithm based on a reduction to linear\nmatroid parity.\n  We also present a strongly polynomial algorithm for the maximum integer free\nmultiflow problem, which asks for a nonnegative integer combination of\n$T$-paths maximizing the sum of the coefficients subject to capacity\nconstraints on the edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 04:25:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 09:53:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2022 01:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-02"}

Organic\nscintillators interact with neutrons mostly via elastic scattering on hydrogen\nnuclei and therefore partially retain neutron energy information. Consequently,\nthe neutron spectrum can be derived through deconvolution of the measured light\noutput spectrum and the response functions of the scintillator to monoenergetic\nneutrons. The proposed approach is compared to three existing methods using\nsimulated data to enable controlled benchmarks. We consider three sets of\ndetector responses.

If the\ncommunication infrastructure breaks down, however, they become almost useless\nas most services rely on Internet connectivity. Building post-disaster networks\nbased purely on smartphones remains a challenging task, and, as of today, no\npractical solutions exist. The rapidly growing Internet of Things (IoT) offers\nthe possibility to improve this situation. With an increase in smart spaces\nsuch as smart homes and smart offices, we move towards digital cities that are\ndeeply penetrated by IoT technology. Many IoT devices are battery powered and\ncan aid in mediating an emergency network. In scenarios where the electrical\ngrid is still operational, yet communication infrastructure failed, non-battery\npowered IoT devices can similarly help to relief congestion or build a backup\nnetwork in case of cyber attacks. With the recent release of the Bluetooth Mesh\nstandard, a common interface between mobile devices and the IoT has become\navailable. The key idea behind this standard is to allow existing and new\ndevices to build large-scale multi-hop sensor networks. By enabling hundreds of\ndevices to communicate with each other, Bluetooth Mesh (BT MESH) becomes a\npractical technical solution for enabling communication post disaster. In this\npaper, we propose a novel emergency network concept that utilises the parts of\ndigital cities that remains operational in case of disaster, thus mediating\nlarge-scale post-disaster device-to-device communication. Since the Bluetooth\nMesh standard is backwards compatible to Bluetooth 4.0, most of todays mobile\ndevices can join such a network. No special hardware or software modifications\nare necessary, especially no jail-breaking of the smartphones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 10:59:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-19"}

Recently, though, it has also\nbeen argued that various scientific fields seem to be trending towards\nconservatism -- the increasing production of what Kuhn (1970) would have called\n`normal science'. This paper will explore a possible explanation for this sort\nof trend: that the process by which scientific research groups form, grow, and\ndissolve might be inherently hostile to high risk science. In particular, I\nemploy a paradigm developed by Smaldino and McElreath (2016) that treats a\nscientific community as a population undergoing selection. As will become\nclear, perhaps counter-intuitively this sort of process in some ways promotes\nhigh risk, high reward science.

While more\nconservative scientists will be able to train students capable of continuing\ntheir successful projects, and so create thriving lineages, successful risky\nscience may not be the sort of thing one can easily pass on. In such cases, the\nstructure of scientific communities selects against high risk, high rewards\nprojects. More generally, this paper makes clear that there are at least two\nprocesses to consider in thinking about how incentives shape scientific\ncommunities -- the process by which individual scientists make choices about\ntheir careers and research, and the selective process governing the formation\nof new research groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 21:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-14"}

An enormous amount of information can be gathered from a single\netch process, a sequence of actions taken to produce an etched wafer from a\nblank piece of silicon. Each final wafer, however, is costly to take\nmeasurements from, which limits the number of examples available to train a\npredictive model. Part of the significance of this work is the success we saw\nfrom the models despite the limited number of examples. In order to accommodate\nthe high dimensional process signatures, we isolated important sensor variables\nand applied domain-specific summarization on the data using multiple feature\nengineering techniques. We used a neural network architecture consisting of the\nsummarized inputs, a single hidden layer of 4032 units, and an output layer of\none unit. Two different models were learned, corresponding to the metrology\nmeasurements in the dataset, Recess and Remaining Mask.

The model can make predictions for a class of etch recipes that\ninclude the correct number of etch steps and plasma reactors with the\nappropriate sensors, which are chambers containing an ionized gas that\ndetermine the manufacture environment. Notably, this method is not restricted\nto some maximum process length due to the summarization techniques used.
