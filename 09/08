The magnetic field\nstrength $\\textbf{H}$ accounts for the eddy current problem in the source\nregions containing the superconducting domains, while the magnetic vector\npotential $\\textbf{A}$ represents the magnetoquasistatic problem in the normal\nand non-conducting domains. Furthermore, we include a slab approximation for\nthe source regions, making the formulation suitable for large scale models\ncomposed of thousands of tapes. In this work, the relevant equations are\nderived and discussed, with emphasis on the coupling conditions. The weak\nformulation is derived, and numerical results are provided in order to both,\nverify the formulation and scale it to the size of an accelerator magnet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Sep 2019 18:11:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 06:59:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 13:41:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

In the latter, slip transmission is only allowed in\npairs of SS in neighbour grains that are suitably oriented for slip transfer\naccording to the Luster-Morris parameter. Modifications of the GB character led\nto important changes in the deformation mechanisms at the GB. In general,\nbicrystals with fully-opaque boundaries showed an increase in the dislocation\ndensity near the GB, which was associated with an increase in the Von Mises\nstress. In contrast, the dislocation pile-ups and the stress concentration were\nless pronounced in the case of partially-transparent boundaries as the slip in\none grain can progress into the next grain with some degree of continuity. No\nstress concentrations were found at these boundaries for fully-transparent\nboundaries, and there was continuity of strain across the boundary, which is\nnot typical of most experimentally observed GBs. Simulations of ideal\nbicrystals oriented for favorable slip transfer on the most highly favored slip\nsystem in grains with high Schmid factors for slip transfer depends on the\nnumber of active SS in operation in the neighborhood and that most boundaries\nwill lead to nearly opaque conditions while some boundaries will be\ntransparent.

Specifically,\nLAMOL is a language model that simultaneously learns to solve the tasks and\ngenerate training samples. When the model is trained for a new task, it\ngenerates pseudo-samples of previous tasks for training alongside data for the\nnew task. The results show that LAMOL prevents catastrophic forgetting without\nany sign of intransigence and can perform five very different language tasks\nsequentially with only one model. Overall, LAMOL outperforms previous methods\nby a considerable margin and is only 2-3% worse than multitasking, which is\nusually considered the LLL upper bound.

Cancer grading and localization of regions of interest\n(ROIs) in these images normally relies on both image- and pixel-level labels,\nthe latter requiring a costly annotation process. Deep weakly-supervised object\nlocalization (WSOL) methods provide different strategies for low-cost training\nof deep learning models. Using only image-class annotations, these methods can\nbe trained to classify an image, and yield class activation maps (CAMs) for ROI\nlocalization. This paper provides a review of state-of-art DL methods for WSOL.\nWe propose a taxonomy where these methods are divided into bottom-up and\ntop-down methods according to the information flow in models. Although the\nlatter have seen limited progress, recent bottom-up methods are currently\ndriving much progress with deep WSOL methods. Early works focused on designing\ndifferent spatial pooling functions. However, these methods reached limited\nlocalization accuracy, and unveiled a major limitation -- the under-activation\nof CAMs which leads to high false negative localization. Subsequent works aimed\nto alleviate this issue and recover complete object. Representative methods\nfrom our taxonomy are evaluated and compared in terms of classification and\nlocalization accuracy on two challenging histology datasets. Overall, the\nresults indicate poor localization performance, particularly for generic\nmethods that were initially designed to process natural images. Methods\ndesigned to address the challenges of histology data yielded good results.\nHowever, all methods suffer from high false positive/negative localization.\nFour key challenges are identified for the application of deep WSOL methods in\nhistology -- under/over activation of CAMs, sensitivity to thresholding, and\nmodel selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2019 00:01:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 14:12:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 04:16:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 05:41:51 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 00:12:01 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 04:15:23 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2023 16:04:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-06"}

Based on this training framework, we propose a novel generative\nmodel that synthesizes visual prototypes conditioned on the class semantic\nprototypes. The proposed model aligns the visual-semantic interactions by\nformulating both the visual prototype generation and the class semantic\ninference into an adversarial framework paired with a parameter-economic\nMulti-modal Cross-Entropy Loss to capture the discriminative information.\nExtensive experiments on four datasets under both traditional ZSL and\ngeneralized ZSL tasks show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art\napproaches by large margins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2019 01:06:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 03:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-03"}

Thus, a timely and\nreliable assessment of disaster impacts on highways is critical for\ndecision-makers to quickly and effectively perform relief and recovery efforts.\nRecently, social media has increasingly been used in disaster management for\nobtaining a rapid, public-centric assessment of disaster impacts due to its\nnear real-time, social and informational characteristics. Although promising,\nthe employment of social media for assessing disaster impacts on highways is\nstill limited due to the inability of extracting accurate highway-related data\nfrom social media. To overcome this limitation, a systematic approach is\nproposed to identify highway-related data from social media for assessing\ndisaster impacts on highways, and a case study of Hurricane Harvey in Houston,\nTX is employed for the demonstration. The approach is constructed through three\nsteps: (1) building data sources for social media and highways of interest in\nHouston, respectively; (2) adapting the social media data to each highway\nthrough a developed mapping algorithm; (3) assessing disaster impacts through\nanalyzing social media activities in terms of their intensity, geographic, and\ntopic distributions. Results show that the proposed approach is capable of\ncapturing the temporal patterns of disaster impacts on highways.

But does this mean that the representations\nencode linguistic structure or just that the probe has learned the linguistic\ntask? In this paper, we propose control tasks, which associate word types with\nrandom outputs, to complement linguistic tasks. By construction, these tasks\ncan only be learned by the probe itself. So a good probe, (one that reflects\nthe representation), should be selective, achieving high linguistic task\naccuracy and low control task accuracy. The selectivity of a probe puts\nlinguistic task accuracy in context with the probe's capacity to memorize from\nword types. We construct control tasks for English part-of-speech tagging and\ndependency edge prediction, and show that popular probes on ELMo\nrepresentations are not selective. We also find that dropout, commonly used to\ncontrol probe complexity, is ineffective for improving selectivity of MLPs, but\nthat other forms of regularization are effective. Finally, we find that while\nprobes on the first layer of ELMo yield slightly better part-of-speech tagging\naccuracy than the second, probes on the second layer are substantially more\nselective, which raises the question of which layer better represents\nparts-of-speech.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2019 02:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

Existing models typically deploy a local or\n'nearest neighbour' approach to capture the size of the labour pool available\nto an industry in related sectors. This approach, however, ignores higher order\ninteractions in the network, and the presence of industry clusters or groups of\nindustries which exhibit high internal skill overlap. We argue that these\nclusters represent skill basins in which workers circulate and diffuse\nknowledge, and delineate the size of the skilled labour force available to an\nindustry. By applying a multi-scale community detection algorithm to this\nnetwork of flows, we identify industry clusters on a range of scales, from many\nsmall clusters to few large groupings. We construct a new variable, cluster\nemployment, which captures the workforce available to an industry within its\nown cluster. Using UK data we show that this variable is predictive of\nindustry-city employment growth and, exploiting the multi-scale nature of the\nindustrial clusters detected, propose a methodology to uncover the optimal\nscale at which labour pooling operates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2019 03:14:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 19:18:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 14:37:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

To attain accurate and\nefficient FCN models, we propose a three-step SW/HW co-design methodology\nconsisting of FCN architectural exploration, precision quantization, and\nhardware acceleration.

As reported, the next sentence prediction (NSP) in BERT, which\nlearns the contextual relationship between two sentences, is of great\nsignificance for downstream problems with sentence-pair input. Despite the\neffectiveness of NSP, we suggest that NSP still lacks the essential signal to\ndistinguish between entailment and shallow correlation. To remedy this, we\npropose to augment the NSP task to a 3-class categorization task, which\nincludes a category for previous sentence prediction (PSP). The involvement of\nPSP encourages the model to focus on the informative semantics to determine the\nsentence order, thereby improves the ability of semantic understanding. This\nsimple modification yields remarkable improvement against vanilla BERT. To\nfurther incorporate the document-level information, the scope of NSP and PSP is\nexpanded into a broader range, i.e., NSP and PSP also include close but\nnonsuccessive sentences, the noise of which is mitigated by the label-smoothing\ntechnique.

It is found that the 1D channels of TKL\nshow different electronic and magnetic behaviors due to different values of the\nhopping integrals and spin-orbit couplings. Two important salient features of\nthese TKLs are the presence of flat bands in their band structure as well as\nthe emergence of the RKKY plateaus versus the Fermi energy.

The most\nremarkable observation is the potential and Fermi energy variation of the width\nand location of the RKKY plateaus in both 0D and 1D TKLs.

However, since the wheel odometer only provides 2D motion\nestimates, it is extremely challenging to use that for performing accurate full\n6D pose (3D position and 3D orientation) estimation. Traditional methods on 6D\npose estimation either approximate sensor or motion models, at the cost of\naccuracy reduction, or rely on other sensors, e.g., inertial measurement unit\n(IMU), to provide complementary measurements. By contrast, in this paper, we\npropose a novel method to utilize the wheel odometer for 6D pose estimation, by\nmodeling and utilizing motion manifold for ground robots. Our approach is\nprobabilistically formulated and only requires the wheel odometer and an\nexteroceptive sensor (e.g., a camera).

Most sampling-based planners use a global random sampling scheme to\nguarantee probabilistic completeness. However, most schemes are often\ninefficient as the samples drawn from the global proposal distribution, and do\nnot exploit relevant local structures. Local sampling-based motion planners, on\nthe other hand, take sequential decisions of random walks to samples valid\ntrajectories in configuration space. However, current approaches do not adapt\ntheir strategies according to the success and failures of past samples.\n  In this work, we introduce a local sampling-based motion planner with a\nBayesian learning scheme for modelling an adaptive sampling proposal\ndistribution. The proposal distribution is sequentially updated based on\nprevious samples, consequently shaping it according to local obstacles and\nconstraints in the configuration space.

The key idea here is to solve an augmented\nPDE system, in which curl errors propagate away via a Maxwell-type evolution\nsystem. The new approach is first presented on a simple model problem, in order\nto explain the basic ideas. Subsequently, we apply it to a strongly hyperbolic\nfirst order reduction of the CCZ4 formulation (FO-CCZ4) of the Einstein field\nequations of general relativity, which is endowed with 11 curl constraints.\nSeveral numerical examples, including the long-time evolution of a stable\nneutron star in anti-Cowling approximation, are presented in order to show the\nobtained improvements with respect to the standard formulation without special\ntreatment of the curl involution constraints. The main advantages of the\nproposed GLM approach are its complete independence of the underlying numerical\nscheme and grid topology and its easy implementation into existing computer\ncodes. However, this flexibility comes at the price of needing to add for each\ncurl involution one additional 3 vector plus another scalar in the augmented\nsystem for homogeneous curl constraints, and even two additional scalars for\nnon-homogeneous curl involutions. For the FO-CCZ4 system with 11 homogeneous\ncurl involutions, this means that additional 44 evolution quantities need to be\nadded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2019 12:58:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 21:25:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 09:43:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 17:03:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 10:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

In these systems glassy\nbehavior is manifested as the density of the particles is increased. Thus, soft\ncolloidal particles with varying degree of softness capture diverse glass\nforming properties, observed normally in molecular glasses. By performing\nBrownian dynamics simulations for a binary mixture of micron-sized charged\ncolloidal suspensions, known to form Wigner glasses, we show that by tuning the\nsoftness of the potential, achievable by changing the monovalent salt\nconcentration, there is a continuous transition between fragile to strong\nbehavior. Remarkably, this is found in a system where the well characterized\npotential between the colloidal particles is isotropic. We also show that the\npredictions of the random first order transition (RFOT) theory quantitatively\ndescribes the universal features such as the growing correlation length,\n$\\xi\\sim (\\phi_K/\\phi - 1)^{-\\nu}$ with $\\nu = 2/3$ where $\\phi_K$, the\nanalogue of the Kauzmann temperature, depends on the salt concentration. As\nanticipated by the RFOT predictions, we establish a causal relationship between\nthe growing correlation length and a steep increase in the relaxation time and\ndynamic heterogeneity. The broad range of fragility observed in Wigner glasses\nis used to draw analogies with molecular glasses. The large variations in the\nfragility is found only when the temperature dependence of the viscosity is\nexamined for a large class of diverse glass forming materials. In sharp\ncontrast, this is vividly illustrated in a single system that can be\nexperimentally probed.

Historic patient data only\ntells us what the possible manifestations of a certain body failure are.\nAnatomy and physiology knowledge tell us how the body works and fails. Both are\nneeded for complete diagnosis. The proposed Double Deep Learning approach,\nalong with the initiative for Medical Wikipedia for Smart Machines, leads to AI\ndiagnostic support solutions for complete diagnosis beyond the limited data\nonly labeling solutions we see today. AI for medicine will forever be limited\nuntil their intelligence also integrates anatomy and physiology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2019 13:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

To manage\nthese dynamics, these systems have to self-adapt their structures and behaviors\ndynamically. While we have witnessed significant progress over the past decade\nin the manner in which such systems are designed, persistent challenges remain.\nIn particular, dealing with distribution and decentralized control remains one\nof the major challenges in self-adaptive systems. This report presents an\narchitecture style that supports software architects with designing\narchitectures for a family of decentralized self-adaptive systems. The\narchitecture style structures the software in a number of interacting\nautonomous entities (agents) that cooperatively realize the system tasks.\nMulti-agent systems derived from the architectural style realize flexibility\n(agents adapt their behavior and interactions to variable operating conditions)\nand openness (agents cope autonomously with other agents that enter and leave\nthe system). The architectural style consists of five related patterns that\ndistill domain-specific architectural knowledge derived from extensive\nexperiences with developing various multi-agent systems. The architectural\npatterns are specified using pi-ADL, a formal architectural description\nlanguage supporting specification of dynamic architectures. This specification\nprovides architects with a rigorous description of the architecture elements of\nthe patterns, their interactions and behavior.

In cases where there exists multiple relations between the\nentities, the complex system can be represented as a multilayer network, where\nthe network in each layer represents one particular relation (or feature). The\nanalysis of multilayer networks involves combining edges from specific layers\nand then computing a network property.\n  Different subsets of the layers can be combined. For any Boolean combination\noperation (e.g. AND, OR), the number of possible subsets is exponential to the\nnumber of layers. Thus recomputing for each subset from scratch is an expensive\nprocess. In this paper, we propose to efficiently analyze multilayer networks\nusing a method that we term network decomposition.\n  Network decomposition is based on analyzing each network layer individually\nand then aggregating the analysis results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nusing network decomposition for detecting communities on different combinations\nof network layers. Our results on multilayer networks obtained from real-world\nand synthetic datasets show that our proposed network decomposition method\nrequires significantly lower computation time while producing results of high\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Sep 2019 18:52:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-04"}

Developing a\nmethod to facilitate the learning of a recommender with biased feedback is one\nof the most challenging problems, as it is widely known that naive approaches\nunder selection bias often lead to suboptimal results. A well-established\nsolution for the problem is using propensity scoring techniques. The propensity\nscore is the probability of each data being observed, and unbiased performance\nestimation is possible by weighting each data by the inverse of its propensity.\nHowever, the performance of the propensity-based unbiased estimation approach\nis often affected by choice of the propensity estimation model or the high\nvariance problem. To overcome these limitations, we propose a model-agnostic\nmeta-learning method inspired by the asymmetric tri-training framework for\nunsupervised domain adaptation. The proposed method utilizes two predictors to\ngenerate data with reliable pseudo-ratings and another predictor to make the\nfinal predictions. In a theoretical analysis, a propensity-independent upper\nbound of the true performance metric is derived, and it is demonstrated that\nthe proposed method can minimize this bound. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments using public real-world datasets. The results suggest that the\nprevious propensity-based methods are largely affected by the choice of\npropensity models and the variance problem caused by the inverse propensity\nweighting. Moreover, we show that the proposed meta-learning method is robust\nto these issues and can facilitate in developing effective recommendations from\nbiased explicit feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2019 07:23:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2019 06:45:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 02:08:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 13:34:38 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 01:27:10 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 19:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}
