Even if an electron\ninside a jet is identified, it is difficult to pinpoint whether the electron\nrich jet is indeed due to top quark decay or not, since the invisible neutrino\ncarries away a nontrivial part of the energy-momentum of the original top\nquark. Broadly speaking, the method proposed here has three key components. It\nuses the distribution of energy in various parts of the detector to identify\nwhether the observed jet is consistent with a jet containing an energetic\nelectron. It uses the substructure of the jet to determine the momentum\nassociated with the electron. Finally, it constructs new variables that carry\ntell-tale features of top quark decay kinematics using an extra ansatz that,\nthere exists a massless invisible four-momentum \\emph{roughly} collimated to\nthe electron, which reconstructs a $W$ and a top when it is combined with the\nelectron and the full jet respectively.

This happens when the bang-time\nfunction $t_B(r)$ has a gate-shaped hump around the origin of the QSS region.\nThe gamma rays arise along two preferred directions of the QSS geometry\n(coincident with dipole extrema when axially symmetric, otherwise unrelated).\nIn these directions, the rays of the relic radiation are blueshifted rather\nthan redshifted. The blueshift is generated in a thin region between the Big\nBang (BB) and the extremum-redshift hypersurface (ERH). But the Szekeres models\ncan describe the real Universe only forward in time from the last-scattering\nhypersurface (LSH) because the matter in them has zero pressure. The ERH is\ntangent to the BB at the origin, so in a neighbourhood thereof the ERH lies\nearlier than the LSH and no blueshift is generated in the physical region. The\nquestion thus arose whether the BB and ERH can be ``unglued'' if the QSS region\nhas no origin, but the areal radius function $\\Phi$ has a local maximum or\nminimum somewhere. In the present paper it is demonstrated that this is indeed\nthe case. If the hump in $t_B(r)$ is centered around the minimum of $\\Phi$,\nthen the BB and ERH in general do not coincide there and a stronger blueshift\nis generated on rays passing nearby. It follows that a lower and narrower hump\non the BB set can generate sufficient blueshift to move the initial frequencies\nof the relic radiation to the gamma range.

It is shown that the caching-NOMA combination provides a new\nopportunity of cache hit which enhances the cache utility as well as the\neffectiveness of NOMA. Importantly, this comes without requiring users'\ncollaboration, and thus, avoids many complicated issues such as users' privacy\nand security, selfishness, etc. In order to optimize users' quality of service\nand, concurrently, ensure the fairness among users, the probability that all\nusers can decode the desired signals is maximized. In NOMA, a combination of\nmultiple messages are sent to users, and the defined objective is approached by\nfinding an appropriate power allocation for message signals. To address the\npower allocation problem, two novel methods are proposed. The first one is a\ndivide-and-conquer-based method for which closed-form expressions for the\noptimal resource allocation policy are derived, making this method simple and\nflexible to the system context. The second one is based on the deep\nreinforcement learning method that allows all users to share the full\nbandwidth.

Then using 22,000 $N$-body simulations of the\nQuijote suite, we quantify for the first time the full information content of\nthe redshift-space halo bispectrum down to nonlinear scales using a Fisher\nmatrix forecast of $\\{\\Omega_m$, $\\Omega_b$, $h$, $n_s$, $\\sigma_8$, $M_\\nu\\}$.\nFor $k_{\\rm max}{=}0.5~h/{\\rm Mpc}$, the bispectrum provides $\\Omega_m$,\n$\\Omega_b$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\\sigma_8$ constraints 1.9, 2.6, 3.1, 3.6, and 2.6\ntimes tighter than the power spectrum. For $M_\\nu$, the bispectrum improves the\n1$\\sigma$ constraint from 0.2968 to 0.0572 eV --- over 5 times tighter than the\npower spectrum. Even with priors from {\\em Planck}, the bispectrum improves\n$M_\\nu$ constraints by a factor of 1.8. Although we reserve marginalizing over\na more complete set of bias parameters to the next paper of the series, these\nconstraints are derived for a $(1~h^{-1}{\\rm Gpc})^3$ box, a substantially\nsmaller volume than upcoming surveys. Thus, our results demonstrate that the\nbispectrum offers significant improvements over the power spectrum, especially\nfor constraining $M_\\nu$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 18:04:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 22:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

When training a deep generative model, the observed data are\noften associated with certain categorical labels, and, in parallel with\nlearning to regenerate data and simulate new data, learning an interpretable\nrepresentation of each class of data is also a process of acquiring knowledge.\nHere, we present a novel generative model, referred to as the Supervised Vector\nQuantized Variational AutoEncoder (S-VQ-VAE), which combines the power of\nsupervised and unsupervised learning to obtain a unique, interpretable global\nrepresentation for each class of data. Compared with conventional generative\nmodels, our model has three key advantages: first, it is an integrative model\nthat can simultaneously learn a feature representation for individual data\npoint and a global representation for each class of data; second, the learning\nof global representations with embedding codes is guided by supervised\ninformation, which clearly defines the interpretation of each code; and third,\nthe global representations capture crucial characteristics of different\nclasses, which reveal similarity and differences of statistical structures\nunderlying different groups of data. We evaluated the utility of S-VQ-VAE on a\nmachine learning benchmark dataset, the MNIST dataset, and on gene expression\ndata from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS).\nWe proved that S-VQ-VAE was able to learn the global genetic characteristics of\nsamples perturbed by the same class of perturbagen (PCL), and further revealed\nthe mechanism correlations between PCLs. Such knowledge is crucial for\npromoting new drug development for complex diseases like cancer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 18:51:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2019 19:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

A\ncommonly adopted solution to overcome this challenge is to approximate the\nfull-order model (anchor) with a simplified, reduced-order model (template),\nwhile performing control synthesis. Unfortunately it is challenging to make\nformal guarantees about the safety of an anchor model using a controller\ndesigned in an online fashion using a template model. To address this problem,\nthis paper proposes a method to generate safety-preserving controllers for\nanchor models by performing reachability analysis on template models while\nbounding the modeling error. This paper describes how this reachable set can be\nincorporated into a Model Predictive Control framework to select controllers\nthat result in safe walking on the anchor model in an online fashion. The\nmethod is illustrated on a 5-link RABBIT model, and is shown to allow the robot\nto walk safely while utilizing controllers designed in an online fashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 18:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-26"}

In recent years, it has been shown that CNNs are vulnerable\nto attacks in which the input image is perturbed by relatively small amounts of\nnoise so that the CNN is no longer able to perform a segmentation of the\nperturbed image with sufficient accuracy. Therefore, exploring methods on how\nto attack CNN-based models as well as how to defend models against attacks have\nbecome a popular topic as this also provides insights into the performance and\ngeneralization abilities of CNNs. However, most of the existing work assumes\nunrealistic attack models, i.e. the resulting attacks were specified in\nadvance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating adversarial\nexamples to attack CNN-based segmentation models for medical images.

To accelerate the design process of infill\ngraded microstructures, a novel asymptotic homogenisation topology optimisation\nmethod was proposed by Zhu et al.(2019), aiming for 1) significantly enriching\nthe pool of representable graded microstructures; 2) deriving an homogenised\nformulation for stress analysis in consistency with fine-scale results. But the\nwork is severely confined from being widely applied, mainly due to the\nfollowing two reasons. Firstly, to circumvent the macroscopically pointwise\ncomputation for solving various microscopic cell problems, linearisation had to\nbe adopted for its numerical implementation, and this significantly reduces the\ndesign freedom. Secondly, lacking of sensitive analysis, genetic algorithm was\nchosen for optimisation, inevitably decreasing the computational efficiency. To\naddress these bottleneck challenging issues, a zoning scheme empowered by\ncomputational parallelism is introduced, and the sensitivity analysis\nassociated with the new asymptotic framework is conducted. Through comparisons\nwith fine-scale simulation results, the proposed algorithm is shown to be an\neffective tool for evaluating the mechanical behaviour of graded\nmicrostructures. As an optimisation tool, the mapping function takes a concise\nand explicit form. But its parameterisation still needs further investigation,\nso as to improve the solution optimality of the present approach, especially in\ncomparison with another recently proposed method by Groen et al (2018).

A further benefit\nof the truncated filter expansion is the improved deformation robustness of the\nequivariant representation, a property which is theoretically analyzed and\nempirically verified. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nscaling-translation-equivariant network with decomposed convolutional filters\n(ScDCFNet) achieves significantly improved performance in multiscale image\nclassification and better interpretability than regular CNNs at a reduced model\nsize.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 21:23:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 18:41:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2022 03:34:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

A system operator route incoming jobs to\nthe shorter queue; if the queues are equal, the job is routed randomly. A\nmalicious attacker is able to intercept the operator's routing instruction and\noverwrite it with a randomly generated one.

To mitigate such potential artifacts, we\ndevelop a procedure to exclude cycles lacking user engagement, thereby allowing\nus to better distinguish true menstrual patterns from tracking anomalies. We\nuncover that women located at different ends of the menstrual variability\nspectrum, based on the consistency of their cycle length statistics, exhibit\nstatistically significant differences in their cycle characteristics and\nsymptom tracking patterns. We also find that cycle and period length statistics\nare stationary over the app usage timeline across the variability spectrum. The\nsymptoms that we identify as showing statistically significant association with\ntiming data can be useful to clinicians and users for predicting cycle\nvariability from symptoms or as potential health indicators for conditions like\nendometriosis. Our findings showcase the potential of longitudinal,\nhigh-resolution self-tracked data to improve understanding of menstruation and\nwomen's health as a whole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 22:21:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 23:41:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 22:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

If the typical distance\nseparating consecutive minima of the landscape potential and the height of the\npotential barriers are smaller than the Hubble expansion rate parametrizing\ninflation, the probability distribution function of isocurvature fields becomes\nnon-Gaussian due to the appearance of bumps and dips associated with the\nstructure of the potential.

We define avoidance learning as the\nprocess of optimizing the agent's reward while avoiding dangerous behaviors\ngiven by a demonstrator. In this work we develop a framework of avoidance\nlearning by defining a suitable objective function for these problems which\ninvolves the \\emph{distance} of state occupancy distributions of the expert and\ndemonstrator policies.

Improving distance measurements of SNe Ia is one technique to better\nconstrain the acceleration of expansion and determine its physical nature. This\ndocument develops a new SNe Ia spectral energy distribution (SED) model, called\nthe SUpernova Generator And Reconstructor (SUGAR), which improves the spectral\ndescription of SNe Ia, and consequently could improve the distance\nmeasurements. This model is constructed from SNe Ia spectral properties and\nspectrophotometric data from The Nearby Supernova Factory collaboration. In a\nfirst step, a PCA-like method is used on spectral features measured at maximum\nlight, which allows us to extract the intrinsic properties of SNe Ia. Next, the\nintrinsic properties are used to extract the average extinction curve. Third,\nan interpolation using Gaussian Processes facilitates using data taken at\ndifferent epochs during the lifetime of a SN Ia and then projecting the data on\na fixed time grid. Finally, the three steps are combined to build the SED model\nas a function of time and wavelength. This is the SUGAR model. The main\nadvancement in SUGAR is the addition of two additional parameters to\ncharacterize SNe Ia variability. The first is tied to the properties of SNe Ia\nejecta velocity, the second is correlated with their calcium lines. The\naddition of these parameters, as well as the high quality the Nearby Supernova\nFactory data, makes SUGAR an accurate and efficient model for describing the\nspectra of normal SNe Ia as they brighten and fade. The performance of this\nmodel makes it an excellent SED model for experiments like ZTF, LSST or WFIRST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 00:13:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

In settings where the encoder/decoder have already exchanged\ncryptographic keys and the channel is a probabilistic polynomial time (PPT)\nalgorithm, it is possible to circumvent these barriers and design LDCs with\nconstant rate and small locality. However, the assumption that the\nencoder/decoder have exchanged cryptographic keys is often prohibitive. We thus\nconsider the problem of designing explicit and efficient LDCs in settings where\nthe channel is slightly more constrained than the encoder/decoder with respect\nto some resource e.g., space or (sequential) time. Given an explicit function\n$f$ that the channel cannot compute, we show how the encoder can transmit a\nrandom secret key to the local decoder using $f(\\cdot)$ and a random oracle\n$H(\\cdot)$. This allows bootstrap from the private key LDC construction of\nOstrovsky, Pandey and Sahai (ICALP, 2007), thereby answering an open question\nposed by Guruswami and Smith (FOCS 2010) of whether such bootstrapping\ntechniques may apply to LDCs in weaker channel models than just PPT algorithms.\nSpecifically, in the random oracle model we show how to construct explicit\nconstant rate LDCs with locality of polylog in the security parameter against\nvarious resource constrained channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 00:55:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 05:44:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2020 05:47:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 03:21:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-08"}

We propose that\na plausible solution to the enigma of Jupiter's uniform enrichment pattern is\nthat Jupiter's core formed exterior to the N2 and Ar snowlines, beyond 30 au,\nresulting in a Solar composition core in all volatiles heavier than Ne.

We note that giant core formation at large\nnebular radii is consistent with recent models of gas giant core formation\nthrough pebble accretion, which requires the core to form exterior to Jupiter's\ncurrent location to counter rapid inward migration during the core and envelope\nformation process.

The\ntheory and simulations show that under an increasing spin rate (such as due to\nthe YORP effect), the regolith covering is preferentially lost across certain\nregions of the body. For regolith with little or no cohesive strength, failure\noccurs by landsliding from the mid latitudes of the body at high enough spin\nrates. As the cohesive strength of the regolith increases, failure occurs by\nfission of grains (or coherent chunks of grains) across a greater extent of\nlatitudes and eventually will first occur at the equator. As the spin rate is\nfurther increased, failure regions migrate from the first failure point to\nhigher and lower latitudes. Eventually failure will encompass the equatorial\nregion, however there always remains a region of high latitudes (around the\npoles) that will not undergo failure for arbitrarily high spin rates (unless\ndisturbed by some other phenomenon).

This\nphenomenon occurs frequently on natural beaches, but has not yet been\nquantified in the literature. Novel application of wave tracking methods\nallowed for investigation of this phenomenon at seven sandy, micro-tidal,\nwave-dominated Australian beaches. The results showed that, for the locations\nwhere beach slope and environmental conditions allowed for bore-bore capture to\noccur, there was a high probability 40% of one bore capturing another bore in\nthe surf or swash zones. The landward-most 10% of the nearshore region (i.e.,\nthe time-varying surf-swash extent) was found to be the most likely location\nfor a bore-bore capture event. Amplitude and frequency dispersion and the\ninteraction between bores and infragravity waves are (indirectly) shown to to\nbe equally important for driving bore-bore capture. Capture events infrequently\nled to extreme horizontal shoreline maxima (approximately 20% of the cases),\nhowever, most extreme shoreline maxima were directly driven by bore-bore\ncapture events >97% of the cases). For the analysed data, there was a direct\nrelation between the probability of bore-bore capture driving extreme shoreline\nmaxima and the Iribarren Number and beach morphodynamic state: the steeper or\nmore reflective the beach, the higher the probability of a bore-bore capture\nevent causing an extreme shoreline maxima event. Such correlation has direct\nimportance for the future development of predictive runup models, which\ncurrently do not account for this phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 04:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Another merit of the proposed BERD\nreceiver is that it can be implemented for both a single receiver and multiple\nreceivers, which ensures successful estimation, recognition, and detection for\nsuch an extremely difficult problem. In addition, numerical results show the\nperformance of the proposed receiver in three folds: a) the BERD receiver\noutperforms the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) pilot-based channel\nestimator by over 3.5 dB at the MSE of 0.01; b) the correct modulation/coding\nrecognition performance of the BERD receiver is within 0.3 dB as close to the\nrecognition benchmark when the perfect channel state information (CSI) is\navailable; c) the BERD receiver is within 0.5 dB at the bit error rate of 0.001\ncompared to the benchmark when the modulation, the channel coding, and the CSI\nare perfectly known.

We\ndiscuss the emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, terahertz\ncommunications, optical wireless technology, free space optic network,\nblockchain, three-dimensional networking, quantum communications, unmanned\naerial vehicle, cell-free communications, integration of wireless information\nand energy transfer, integration of sensing and communication, integration of\naccess-backhaul networks, dynamic network slicing, holographic beamforming, and\nbig data analytics that can assist the 6G architecture development in\nguaranteeing the QoS. We present the expected applications with the\nrequirements and the possible technologies for 6G communication. We also\noutline the possible challenges and research directions to reach this goal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 07:27:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-26"}

With the motivation of investigating the underlying reason, we\nuse multistage SIR and SEIR models to provide an explanation for this time\nshift. Numerical solutions of these models present strong evidences that the\ndelay is approximately half of the infection period of the epidemic disease. In\naddition, graphs of the classical SIR and the multistage SIR models; and the\nclassical SEIR and the multistage SEIR models are compared for various epidemic\nparameters. Depending on the number of stages, it is observed that the delay\nvaries for relatively small stage numbers whereas it does not change for large\nnumbers in multistage systems. One important result that follows immediately\nfrom this observation is that this fixed delay for large numbers explains the\ntime shift. Additionally, depending on the stage number and the duration of the\nepidemic disease, the distance between the points where each infectious stage\nreaches its maximum is found approximately both graphically and qualitatively\nfor both systems. Variations of the time shift, the maximum point of the sum of\nall infectious stages, and the in ection point of the removed stage are\nobserved subject to the stage number N and it is shown that these variations\nstay unchanged for greater values of N.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 07:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-26"}

We introduce a general reduced order model-based\ndesign optimization acceleration approach that is applicable not only to design\noptimization problems, but also to any PDE-constrained optimization problems.\nThe acceleration is achieved by two techniques: i) allowing an inexact linear\nsolve and ii) reducing the number of iterations in Krylov subspace iterative\nmethods.

Depthwise Separable\nConvolution (DSConv), which replaces a standard convolution with a depthwise\nconvolution and a pointwise convolution, has been used for building lightweight\narchitectures. However, previous works based on depthwise separable convolution\nare limited when compressing a trained CNN model since 1) they are mostly\nheuristic approaches without a precise understanding of their relations to\nstandard convolution, and 2) their accuracies do not match that of the standard\nconvolution. In this paper, we propose FALCON, an accurate and lightweight\nmethod to compress CNN. FALCON uses GEP, our proposed mathematical formulation\nto approximate the standard convolution kernel, to interpret existing\nconvolution methods based on depthwise separable convolution. By exploiting the\nknowledge of a trained standard model and carefully determining the order of\ndepthwise separable convolution via GEP, FALCON achieves sufficient accuracy\nclose to that of the trained standard model. Furthermore, this interpretation\nleads to developing a generalized version rank-k FALCON which performs k\nindependent FALCON operations and sums up the result. Experiments show that\nFALCON 1) provides higher accuracy than existing methods based on depthwise\nseparable convolution and tensor decomposition, and 2) reduces the number of\nparameters and FLOPs of standard convolution by up to a factor of 8 while\nensuring similar accuracy.

This generally\ninvolves the prediction and understanding of motion patterns of dynamic\nentities, such as vehicles and people, in the surroundings. Many motion\nprediction methods in the literature can learn a function, mapping position and\ntime to potential trajectories taken by people or other dynamic entities.\nHowever, these predictions depend only on previously observed trajectories, and\ndo not explicitly take into consideration the environment. Trends of motion\nobtained in one environment are typically specific to that environment, and are\nnot used to better predict motion in other environments. In this paper, we\naddress the problem of generating likely motion dynamics conditioned on the\nenvironment, represented as an occupancy map. We introduce the Occupancy\nConditional Trajectory Network (OCTNet) framework, capable of generalising the\npreviously observed motion in known environments, to generate trajectories in\nnew environments where no observations of motion has not been observed. OCTNet\nencodes trajectories as a fixed-sized vector of parameters and utilises neural\nnetworks to learn conditional distributions over parameters.

To unveil the biological and ecological factors promoting the\nemergence and stability of cooperative traits we take an interdisciplinary\nperspective and review insights gained from both mathematical models and\nwell-controlled experimental model systems.

As a specific but generic\nbiological example we consider populations of Pseudomonas putida and its\nregulation and utilization of pyoverdines, iron scavenging molecules. The\nreview closes with an overview on cooperation in spatially extended systems and\nalso provides a critical assessment of the insights gained from the\nexperimental and theoretical studies discussed.

A\nproposed mechanism to explain this evolution is that the threads were heated by\nturbulence driven by the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability that developed as a\nresult of wave-driven shear flows on the surface of the thread. As the\nKelvin--Helmholtz instability is an instability that works to mix the fluids,\nin the solar corona it can be expected to work by mixing the cool prominence\nmaterial with that of the hot corona to form a warm boundary layer. In this\npaper we develop a simple phenomenological model of nonlinear Kelvin--Helmholtz\nmixing, using it to determine the characteristic density and temperature of the\nmixing layer, which for the case under study with constant pressure across the\ntwo fluids are $\\rho_{\\rm mixed}=\\sqrt{\\rho_1\\rho_2}$ and $T_{\\rm\nmixed}=\\sqrt{T_1T_2}$. One result from the model is that it provides an\naccurate, as determined by comparison with simulation results, determination of\nthe kinetic energy in the mean velocity field. A consequence of this is that\nthe magnitude of turbulence, and with it the energy that can be dissipated on\nfast time-scales, as driven by this instability can be determined. For the\nprominence-corona system, the mean temperature rise possible from turbulent\nheating is estimated to be less than 1\\% of the characteristic temperature\n(which is found to be $10^5$\\,K). These results highlight that mixing, and not\nheating, are likely to be the cause of the observed transition between cool to\nwarm material in Okamoto et. al (2015). One consequence of this result is that\nthe mixing creates a region with higher radiative loss rates on average than\neither of the original fluids, meaning that this instability could contribute a\nnet loss of thermal energy from the corona, i.e. coronal cooling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 09:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

This paper presents\nalternative designs of decentralized trust management and their efficiency and\nrobustness from three perspectives.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for\npresenting and comparing the GW signals that are predicted by different models.\nOur approach is based on the observation that the GW signal has an\napproximately model-independent spectral shape. This allows us to represent it\nsolely in terms of a finite number of observables, that is, a set of peak\namplitudes and peak frequencies. As an example, we consider the GW signal in\nthe real-scalar-singlet extension of the Standard Model (xSM). We construct the\nsignal region of the xSM in the space of observables and show how it will be\nprobed by future space-borne interferometers. Our analysis results in\nsensitivity plots that are reminiscent of similar plots that are typically\nshown for dark-matter direct-detection experiments, but which are novel in the\ncontext of GWs from a SFOPT. These plots set the stage for a systematic model\ncomparison, the exploration of underlying model-parameter dependencies, and the\nconstruction of distribution functions in the space of observables. In our\nplots, the experimental sensitivities of future searches for a stochastic GW\nsignal are indicated by peak-integrated sensitivity curves.

We\nstudy the diffusion of fluorescent colloidal particles in a matrix of\nmicropillars having a range of structural configurations: from completely\nordered to completely random. We show that non-Gaussianity emerges as a direct\nconsequence of two coupled factors; individual particle diffusivities become\nspatially dependent in a heterogeneous randomly structured environment, and the\nspatial distribution of the particles varies significantly in such\nenvironments, further influencing the diffusivity of a single particle. The\ncoupled mechanisms lead to a considerable non-Gaussian nature even due to weak\ndisorder in the arrangement of the micropillars. A simple mathematical model\nvalidates our hypothesis that non-Gaussian yet Fickian diffusion in our system\narises from the superstatistical behavior of the ensemble in a structurally\nheterogeneous environment.

A particular emphasis of the\npresent study is given to the understanding of the low-Froude-number mode\nobserved by the recent experiment (Meunier, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 699, 2012, pp.\n174-197). In the limit of low Froude number, the linearised equations of motion\ncan be reduced to the Orr-Sommerfeld equation on the horizontal plane, except\nthe viscous term that contains vertical dissipation. Based on this equation, it\nis proposed that the low-Froude-number mode would be a horizontal inflectional\ninstability, and should remain two dimensional at small tilting angles. To\nsupport this claim, the asymptotic regime where this equation would be strictly\nvalid is subsequently discussed in relation to previous arguments on the proper\nvertical length scale. Furthermore, the absolute and convective instability\nanalysis of parallel wake is performed, revealing qualitatively good agreement\nwith the experimental result. The low-Froude-number mode is found to be\nstabilised on increasing Froude number, as is in the experiment. The emergence\nof small vertical velocity at finite Froude number, the size of which is\nproportional to the square of Froude number, plays the key role in the\nstabilisation. It modifies the inflectional instability and is also associated\nwith the paradoxically stabilising buoyancy on increasing Froude number.\nLastly, we proposed some possible behaviours of the base flow when the tilting\nangle changes, and they may provide a better approximation to produce the\nbehaviour consistent with the experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 09:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-26"}

To raise the bar, a wide range of\nprotection measures were proposed in the literature each of which adds\nresilience against certain attacks on certain digital assets of a program.\nIntuitively, composing a set of protections (rather than applying just one of\nthem) can mitigate a wider range of attacks and hence offer a higher level of\nsecurity. Despite the potential benefits, very limited research has been done\non the composition of protections. Naive compositions could lead to conflicts\nwhich, in turn, limit the application of protections, raise false alarms, and\nworse yet, yield corrupted binaries.

The key challenge is to\naccurately find and correlate shared semantics in image and text. Most existing\nmethods achieve this goal by representing the shared semantic as a weighted\ncombination of all the fragments (image regions or text words), where fragments\nrelevant to the shared semantic obtain more attention, otherwise less. However,\ndespite relevant ones contribute more to the shared semantic, irrelevant ones\nwill more or less disturb it, and thus will lead to semantic misalignment in\nthe correlation phase. To address this issue, we present a novel Bidirectional\nFocal Attention Network (BFAN), which not only allows to attend to relevant\nfragments but also diverts all the attention into these relevant fragments to\nconcentrate on them. The main difference with existing works is they mostly\nfocus on learning attention weight while our BFAN focus on eliminating\nirrelevant fragments from the shared semantic. The focal attention is achieved\nby pre-assigning attention based on inter-modality relation, identifying\nrelevant fragments based on intra-modality relation and reassigning attention.\nFurthermore, the focal attention is jointly applied in both image-to-text and\ntext-to-image directions, which enables to avoid preference to long text or\ncomplex image. Experiments show our simple but effective framework\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art, with relative Recall@1 gains of\n2.2% on both Flicr30K and MSCOCO benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 11:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-26"}

Task performance must be reliable\nover an individual's lifetime and must deal robustly with the finite lifespan\nof cells or with connection failure - rendering aging a relevant feature in\nthis context. How do computations degrade over an organism's lifespan? How\nreliable can computations remain throughout? In order to answer these\nquestions, here we approach the problem under a multiobjective (Pareto)\noptimization approach. We consider a population of digital organisms equipped\nwith a neural network that must solve a given computational task reliably. We\ndemand that they remain functional (as reliable as possible) for an extended\nlifespan. Neural connections are costly (as an associated metabolism in living\nbeings) and degrade over time.

We\ninvestigate the simultaneous minimization of the metabolic burden (due to\nconnections and regeneration costs) and the computational error and the\ntradeoffs emerging thereof. We show that Pareto optimal designs display a broad\nrange of potential solutions: from small networks with high regeneration rate,\nto larger and redundant circuits that regenerate slowly. The organism's\nlifespan and the external damage rates are found to act as an evolutionary\npressure that improve the exploration of the space of solutions and poses\ntighter optimality conditions.

The GCT is based on a Schwarzschild- Couder (S-C) dual-mirror optical\ndesign which has the advantages, compared to the current IACTs, to offer a wide\nfield of view (~ 9{\\deg}) while decreasing the cost and volume (~ 9 m x 4 m x 6\nm for ~ 11 tons) of the telescope structure, as well as the camera. The\nprototype (pGCT) has been installed at the Meudon's site of the Observatory of\nParis and was the first S-C telescope and the first CTA prototype to record VHE\nevents on-sky in November 2015. After three years of intensive testing, pGCT\nhas now been commissioned. This paper is a status report on the complete GCT\ntelescope optical system and the performance it can provide for CTA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 12:46:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-26"}

We work with the second order stochastic quantization of Einstein\nequations in a (d+1)-dimensional bulk. There, the evolution is governed by the\nstochastic time, which foliates the bulk into Euclidean d-dimensional leaves.\nThe internal metric of each leaf can be parametrized by its unimodular part and\nconformal factor. Additional bulk metric components are the ADM stochastic\nlapse and a stochastic shift. The Langevin equation determines the acceleration\nof the leaf as the sum of a quantum noise, a drift force proportional to\nEinstein equations and a viscous first order force. Using Weyl covariant\ndecomposition, this Langevin equation splits into irreducible stochastic\nequations, one for the unimodular part of the metric and one for its conformal\nfactor. For the first order Langevin equation, the unphysical fields are the\nconformal factor, which is a classical spectator, and the stochastic lapse and\nshift. These fields can be gauge-fixed in a BRST invariant way in function of\nthe initial data of the process. One gets observables that are covariant with\nrespect to internal reparametrization in each leaf, and invariant under\narbitrary reparametrization of the stochastic time.

Two parameters,\n$\\alpha$ (ballistic coefficient) and $\\beta$ (mass-loss), can be calculated for\nany event with some degree of deceleration, given only velocity and height\ninformation. $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ can be used to analytically describe a\ntrajectory with the advantage that they are not mere fitting coefficients; they\nalso represent the physical meteoroid properties. This approach can be applied\nto any fireball network as an initial identification of key events and\ndetermine on which to concentrate resources for more in depth analyses. We used\na set of 278 events observed by the Desert Fireball Network to show how\nvisualisation in an $\\alpha$ - $\\beta$ diagram can quickly identify which\nfireballs are likely meteorite candidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 13:48:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

However, finding them can be challenging. Several\nsubdwarf B (sdB) binary systems with possible neutron star companions have been\nidentified, allowing us to perform a targeted search for MSPs within these\nsystems. Six sdBs with companions in the neutron star mass range, as determined\nfrom their optical light curves, were observed with the Green Bank and\nWesterbork radio telescopes. The data were searched for periodic signals as\nwell as single pulses. No radio pulsations from sdB systems were detected, down\nto an average sensitivity limit of 0.11 mJy. We did, however, discover a pulsar\nin the field of sdB HE0532-4503. Follow-up observations with the Giant\nMetrewave Radio Telescope showed that this pulsar, J0533-4524, is not spatially\ncoincident with the sdB system. The pulsar has a relatively low magnetic field\nbut still emits giant pulses. We place an upper limit of three to the number of\nradio pulsars in the six sdB systems. The non-detections may be explained by a\ncombination of the MSP beaming fraction, luminosity, and a recycling fraction\n<0.5. Alternatively, the assumption of co-rotation between the MSP and sdB may\nbreak down, which implies the systems are more edge-on than previously thought.\nThis would shift the predicted companion masses into the white dwarf range.

Computational low frequency extrapolation is in principle the\nmost direct way to address this issue. By considering bandwidth extension as a\nregression problem in machine learning, we propose an architecture of\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically extrapolate the missing low\nfrequencies without preprocessing and post-processing steps. The bandlimited\nrecordings are the inputs of the CNN and, in our numerical experiments, a\nneural network trained from enough samples can predict a reasonable\napproximation to the seismograms in the unobserved low frequency band, both in\nphase and in amplitude. The numerical experiments considered are set up on\nsimulated P-wave data. In extrapolated FWI (EFWI), the low-wavenumber\ncomponents of the model are determined from the extrapolated low frequencies,\nbefore proceeding with a frequency sweep of the bandlimited data. The proposed\ndeep-learning method of low-frequency extrapolation shows adequate\ngeneralizability for the initialization step of EFWI. Numerical examples show\nthat the neural network trained on several submodels of the Marmousi model is\nable to predict the low frequencies for the BP 2004 benchmark model.\nAdditionally, the neural network can robustly process seismic data with\nuncertainties due to the existence of noise, poorly-known source wavelet, and\ndifferent finite-difference scheme in the forward modeling operator. Finally,\nthis approach is not subject to the structural limitations of other methods for\nbandwidth extension, and seems to offer a tantalizing solution to the problem\nof properly initializing FWI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 14:55:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 04:35:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-14"}

The $n$ players of the game are\nservers who need to place themselves on the line segment, and once this is\ndone, each client gets served by the player closest to it. The goal of each\nplayer is to choose its location so as to maximize the number of clients it\nattracts.\n  In this paper we study a variant of the Hotelling game where each client $v$\nhas a tolerance interval, randomly distributed according to some density\nfunction $f$, and $v$ gets served by the nearest among the players eligible for\nit, namely, those that fall within its interval. (If no such player exists,\nthen $v$ abstains.) It turns out that this modification significantly changes\nthe behavior of the game and its states of equilibria. In particular, it may\nserve to explain why players sometimes prefer to \"spread out\", rather than to\ncluster together as dictated by the classical Hotelling game.\n  We consider two variants of the game: symmetric games, where clients have the\nsame tolerance range to their left and right, and asymmetric games, where the\nleft and right ranges of each client are determined independently of each\nother. We fully characterize the Nash equilibria of the 2-player game. For at\nleast 3 players, we characterize a specific class of strategy profiles,\nreferred to as canonical profiles, and show that these profiles are the only\nones that may yield Nash equilibria in our game. Moreover, the canonical\nprofile, if exists, is uniquely defined for every $n$ and $f$. In both the\nsymmetric and asymmetric setting, we give necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor the canonical profile to be a Nash equilibrium, and demonstrate their\napplication for several distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 15:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-26"}

This is due their similar observing requirements: large\nfields of view, long sequences, and short cadence. If the targeted fields are\nnot located far from the ecliptic, many asteroids will cross occasionally the\nfield of view. We present two complementary methodologies to identify asteroids\nserendipitously observed in large-area astronomical surveys. One methodology\nfocuses on detecting already known asteroids using the Virtual Observatory tool\nSkyBoT, which predicts their positions and motions in the sky at a specific\nepoch. The other methodology applies the ssos pipeline, which is able to\nidentify known and new asteroids based on their apparent motion. The\napplication of these methods to the 6.4 deg 2 of the sky covered by the\nWide-Field CAMera Transit Survey in the J-band is described.

Whereas point forecasting\nprovides a single expected value, probabilistic forecasts provide more\ninformation in the form of quantiles, prediction intervals, or full predictive\ndensities. Traditionally quantile regression is applied for such forecasting\nand recently quantile regression neural networks have become popular for\nweather and renewable energy forecasting. However, one major shortcoming of\ncomposite quantile estimation in neural networks is the quantile crossover\nproblem. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of a novel smoothed loss and\npenalty function for neural network architectures to prevent the quantile\ncrossover problem. Its efficacy is examined on the wind power forecasting\nproblem. A numerical case study is conducted using publicly available wind data\nfrom the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014. Multiple quantiles are\nestimated to form 10\\%, to 90\\% prediction intervals which are evaluated using\na quantile score and reliability measures. Benchmark models such as the\npersistence and climatology distributions, multiple quantile regression, and\nsupport vector quantile regression are used for comparison where results\ndemonstrate the proposed approach leads to improved performance while\npreventing the problem of overlapping quantile estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 21:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-27"}

The biomechanical model utilises this estimated muscle excitation to\nproduce corresponding changes in elbow angle, which is then linearly mapped to\nF0 of a vocal sound synthesiser. We use the F0 value mapped from the actual\nkinematic hand data (via same function) as the ground truth and compare the F0\nestimated from brain signal. A detailed qualitative and quantitative\nperformance comparison shows that the proposed neuromuscular pathway can indeed\nbe utilised to accurately control the vocal fundamental frequency, thereby\ndemonstrating the success of our closed loop neuro-biomechanical control\nscheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 02:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-07"}

It aims to increase production\nrates, decrease production costs, and reduce human intervention in order to\navoid human mistakes and time delays during manufacturing. On the other hand,\nhuman assistance is usually required to customize products and reconfigure\ncontrol systems through a special process interface called Human Machine\nInterface (HMI). Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can effectively be used to\nresolve this tradeoff between full automation and human assistance.This paper\nprovides an example of the industrial application of ML algorithms to help\nhuman operators save their mental effort and avoid time delays and unintended\nmistakes for the sake of high production rates. Based on real-time sensor\nmeasurements, several ML algorithms have been tried to classify paper rolls\naccording to paper grammage in a white paper mill. The performance evaluation\nshows that the AdaBoost algorithm is the best ML algorithm for this application\nwith classification accuracy (CA), precision, and recall of 97.1%. The\ngeneralization of the proposed approach for achieving cost-effective mills\nconstruction will be the subject of our future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 12:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

One potential technology that is very promising\nto achieve the required power-to-weight ratio for short-range aircraft, are\nsuperconductors used for high current densities in the stator or high magnetic\nfields in the rotor. In this paper, we present an indepth analysis of the\npotential for fully and partially superconducting electric machines that is\nbased on an analytical approach taking into account all relevant physical\ndomains such as electromagnetics, superconducting properties, thermal behavior\nas well as structural mechanics. For the requirements of the motors in the NASA\nN3-X concept aircraft, we find that fully superconducting machines could\nachieve 3.5 times higher power-to-weight ratio than partially superconducting\nmachines. Furthermore, our model can be used to calculate the relevant KPIs\nsuch as mass, efficiency and cryogenic cooling requirements for any other\nmachine design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 12:33:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Their resistance to\ndegradation, selectivity and greater binding affinity in comparison to usual\nnucleic acids led to consideration of their great potential for different\napplications. For example, they can be used in molecular diagnostics and\nantisense therapeutics such as antimicrobial agents or gene regulatory tools.\nOn the other hand, large hydrophilic property of PNA molecules, which inhibit\nthem to cross cell membranes readily, is an obstacle for their delivery to\nconsidered target cells and a limiting criterion for their applications.\nTherefore, PNA delivery technologies have been developing to hurdle this\nlimitation. For example, addition of lysine residues, charged membrane\npenetrating peptide sequences, PNAs conjugated with antibodies or steroids,\ncationic liposomes as carriers of PNA conjugates, protective peptides and\ntechnology of photochemical internalization (PCI) as well as by the recent\ntechnology of nanoparticle-based delivery have been employed.
