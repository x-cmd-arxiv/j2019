Through the detailed analysis of the observed parameters,\nour study support that it actually belongs to the LRN class, and was likely\nproduced by the coalescence of two massive stars. Methods: We obtained ten\nmonths of optical and near-infrared photometric monitoring, and eleven epochs\nof low-resolution optical spectroscopy of AT~2018hso. We compared its observed\nproperties with those of other ILRTs and LRNe. We also inspected the archival\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) images obtained about 15 years ago to constrain\nthe progenitor's properties. Results: The light curves of AT 2018hso show a\nfirst sharp peak (Mr = -13.93 mag), followed by a broader and shallower second\npeak, that resembles a plateau in the optical bands. The spectra dramatically\nchange with time. Early time spectra show prominent Balmer emission lines and a\nweak Ca II] doublet, which is usually observed in ILRTs. However, the major\ndecrease in the continuum temperature, the appearance of narrow metal\nabsorption lines, the major change in the H$\\alpha$ strength and profile, and\nthe emergence of molecular bands support a LRN classification. The possible\ndetection of an I ~ -8 mag source at the position of AT 2018hso in HST archive\nimages is consistent with expectations for a pre-merger massive binary, similar\nto the precursor of the 2015 LRN in M101. Conclusions: We provide reasonable\narguments to support a LRN classification for AT~2018hso. This study reveals\ngrowing heterogeneity in the observables of LRNe than thought in the past,\nmaking sometimes tricky the discrimination between LRNe and ILRTs.

We\napply a linear modal analysis to this basic state to demonstrate that for a\nfixed Prandtl number and slope angle, two independent dimensionless parameters\nare sufficient to describe the flow stability. One of these parameters is the\nstratification perturbation number that we have introduced in Xiao & Senocak\n(2019). The second parameter, which we will henceforth designate the wind\nforcing number, is hitherto uncharted and can be interpreted as the ratio of\nthe kinetic energy of the ambient wind aloft to the damping due to viscosity\nand stabilizing effect of the background stratification. For a fixed Prandtl\nnumber, stationary transverse and travelling longitudinal modes of\ninstabilities can emerge, depending on the value of the slope angle and the\naforementioned dimensionless numbers. The influence of ambient wind forcing on\nthe base flow's stability is complicated as the ambient wind can be both\nstabilizing as well as destabilizing for a certain range of the parameters.

In contrast to other works,\nwe break the additional gauge symmetry in the bulk via two complex scalars\nwhich acquire bulk vevs, rather than relying on brane-localized symmetry\nbreaking. A gauge-covariant Kaluza-Klein decomposition of a theory with a bulk\nspontaneously broken gauge symmetry is performed, and exact expressions for the\nbulk profiles of all physical particles in such systems are given. The SM quark\nmasses and mixings are then recreated using gauge-covariant bulk quark mass\nterms and Yukawa-like couplings to the new bulk scalars. A numerical sampling\nof points in the model parameter space that recreate the quark masses and\nmixings is performed at a KK scale of $M_{KK} =5$ TeV. We then compute the\n$\\Delta F = 2$ 4-quark operators arising from our new flavor gauge bosons and\nscalars, and those arising from Kaluza-Klein modes of SM gauge bosons. By\ndecoupling one of our bulk scalar fields to all quark fields except the\nright-handed up-like sector, we find that it is possible to greatly suppress\ntree-level contributions to the highly constrained Kaon mixing parameters.\nInstead, the dominant constraints on the model emerge from neutral $B_d$ and\n$D$ meson mixing.

Automatic ICD coding is in high demand\nas the manual coding can be labor-intensive and error-prone. It is a\nmulti-label text classification task with extremely long-tailed label\ndistribution, making it difficult to perform fine-grained classification on\nboth frequent and zero-shot codes at the same time. In this paper, we propose a\nlatent feature generation framework for generalized zero-shot ICD coding, where\nwe aim to improve the prediction on codes that have no labeled data without\ncompromising the performance on seen codes. Our framework generates pseudo\nfeatures conditioned on the ICD code descriptions and exploits the ICD code\nhierarchical structure. To guarantee the semantic consistency between the\ngenerated features and real features, we reconstruct the keywords in the input\ndocuments that are related to the conditioned ICD codes. To the best of our\nknowledge, this works represents the first one that proposes an adversarial\ngenerative model for the generalized zero-shot learning on multi-label text\nclassification. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach. On the public MIMIC-III dataset, our methods improve the F1 score\nfrom nearly 0 to 20.91% for the zero-shot codes, and increase the AUC score by\n3% (absolute improvement) from previous state of the art. We also show that the\nframework improves the performance on few-shot codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Sep 2019 21:32:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

For these properties, we also investigate the use of the self-consistent\nFLOSIC-SCAN density in the SCAN functional and find that this DFA@FLOSIC-DFA\napproach yields improved results compared to pure, self-consistent SCAN\ncalculations.

Price elasticity (PE) matrices are commonly used to model the change in\nfood purchasing. Usually a PE matrix is generated in one setting then applied\nto another setting with differing starting consumption and prices of foods.\nThis violates econometric assumptions resulting in likely misestimation of\ntotal food consumption. We illustrate rescaling all consumption after applying\na PE matrix using a total food expenditure elasticity (TFEe, the expenditure\nelasticity for all food combined given the policy induced change in the total\nprice of food). We use case studies of NZ$2 per 100g saturated fat (SAFA) tax,\nNZ$0.4 per 100g sugar tax, and a 20% fruit and vegetable (F&V) subsidy. Methods\nWe estimated changes in food purchasing using a NZ PE matrix applied\nconventionally, then with TFEe adjustment. Impacts were quantified for total\nfood expenditure and health adjusted life years (HALYs) for the total NZ\npopulation alive in 2011 over the rest of their lifetime using a multistate\nlifetable model. Results Two NZ studies gave TFEes of 0.68 and 0.83, with\ninternational estimates ranging from 0.46 to 0.90. Without TFEe adjustment,\ntotal food expenditure decreased with the tax policies and increased with the\nF&V subsidy, implausible directions of shift given economic theory. After TFEe\nadjustment, HALY gains reduced by a third to a half for the two taxes and\nreversed from an apparent health loss to a health gain for the F&V subsidy.\nWith TFEe adjustment, HALY gains (in 1000s) were 1,805 (95% uncertainty\ninterval 1,337 to 2,340) for the SAFA tax, 1,671 (1,220 to 2,269) for the sugar\ntax, and 953 (453 to 1,308) for the F&V subsidy. Conclusions If PE matrices are\napplied in settings beyond where they were derived, additional scaling is\nlikely required. We suggest that the TFEe is a useful scalar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2019 01:31:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

The\ninspiring prediction offers a novel way to study magnetic monopole excitations\nand magnetoelectric coupling. However, no clear example has been identified up\nto now.

The observations consistently point to the displacement of the\noxygen O\" anions along [111] axis which gives rise to the formation of electric\ndipoles.

This paper aims to\nquantify the influence of CAVs on HVs by studying the high-resolution vehicle\ntrajectory data that is obtained from microscopic simulation. Two clustering\nstrategies for CACC are implemented: an ad hoc coordination one and a local\ncoordination one. Results show that the local coordination outperforms the ad\nhoc coordination across all tested market penetration rates (MPRs) in terms of\nnetwork throughput and productivity.

Regardless of the clustering strategy, CAVs\nincrease the average lane change frequency for HVs. 30% MPR is the break-even\npoint for local coordination, after which the average lane change frequency\ndecreases from the peak 5.42 to 5.38.

This work demonstrated three types of FDRBs, including\ntype III pair bursts, narrow band stochastic spike bursts following the type\nIII bursts and spike-like bursts superimposed on type II burst in an X1.3 flare\non 2014 April 25. We find that although all of them have fast frequency\ndrifting rates, but they are intrinsically different from each other in\nfrequency bandwidth, drifting rate and the statistical distributions.

One of the limiting factors of this therapy is prostatic\ncalcifications. These attenuate and reflect ultrasound and thus reduce the\nefficacy of the heating. The aim of this study is to investigate how prostatic\ncalcifications affect therapeutic efficacy, and to identify the best sonication\nstrategy when calcifications are present. Methods: Realistic computational\nmodels were used on clinical patient data in order to simulate different\ntherapeutic situations with naturally occurring calcifications as well as\nartificial calcifications of different sizes (1-10 mm) and distances (5-15 mm).\nFurthermore, different sonication strategies were tested in order to deliver\ntherapy to the untreated tissue regions behind the calcifications. Results: The\npresence of calcifications in front of the ultrasound field was found to\nincrease the peak pressure by 100% on average while the maximum temperature\nonly rose by 9% during a 20-s sonication. Losses in ultrasound energy were due\nto the relatively large acoustic impedance mismatch between the prostate tissue\nand the calcifications (1.63 vs 3.20 MRayl) and high attenuation coefficient\n(0.78 vs 2.64 dB/MHz^1.1/cm), which together left untreated tissue regions\nbehind the calcifications. In addition, elevated temperatures were seen in the\nregion between the transducer and the calcifications. Lower sonication\nfrequencies (1-4 MHz) were not able to penetrate through the calcifications\neffectively, but longer sonication durations (20-60 s) with selective\ntransducer elements were effective in treating the tissue regions behind the\ncalcifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2019 08:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

Many methods have achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance levels on this task. Recently, salient instance segmentation has\nbecome an even more challenging task than traditional salient region detection;\nhowever, few of the existing methods have concentrated on this underexplored\nproblem. Unlike the existing methods, which usually employ object proposals to\nroughly count and locate object instances, our method applies salient objects\nsubitizing to predict an accurate number of instances for salient instance\nsegmentation. In this paper, we propose a multitask densely connected neural\nnetwork (MDNN) to segment salient instances in an image. In contrast to\nexisting approaches, our framework is proposal-free and category-independent.\nThe MDNN contains two parallel branches: the first is a densely connected\nsubitizing network (DSN) used for subitizing prediction; the second is a\ndensely connected fully convolutional network (DFCN) used for salient region\ndetection. The MDNN simultaneously outputs saliency maps and salient object\nsubitizing. Then, an adaptive deep feature-based spectral clustering operation\nsegments the salient regions into instances based on the subitizing and\nsaliency maps. The experimental results on both salient region detection and\nsalient instance segmentation datasets demonstrate the satisfactory performance\nof our framework.

This problem is equivalent to\nfinding the leading eigenvalue of the associated symmetric tensor of higher\norder, which is nonconvex and NP-hard. Recent advances show that semidefinite\nrelaxation is quite effective to find a global solution. However, the solution\nmethods involve full/partial eigenvalue decomposition during the iterates,\nwhich heavily limits its efficiency and scalability. On the other hand, for odd\ndegree (odd order) cases, the order has to be increased to even, which\npotentially reduces the efficiency.\n  To find the global solutions, instead of convexifying the problem, we\nequivalently reformulate the problem as a nonconvex matrix program based on an\nequivalence property between symmetric rank-1 tensors and matrices of any\norder, which is a generalization of the existing results. The program is\ndirectly solved by a vanilla alternating direction method, which only involves\nthe computation of leading eigenvalue/singular value of certain matrices,\nbenefiting from the special structure of the program. Although being nonconvex,\nunder certain hypotheses, it is proved that the algorithm converges to a\nleading eigenvalue of the associated tensor. Numerical experiments on different\nclasses of tensors demonstrate that the proposed approach has a significant\nimprovement in efficiency and scalability, while it can keep the effectiveness\nof semidefinite relaxation as much as possible.

In a simple model we distinguish two distinct dynamic modes\ncharacterized by different timescales. We find that the slower mode defines the\neffective diffusion and degradation as well as the shape of the concentration\nprofile in steady state. Using our approach we discuss mechanisms of morphogen\ntransport in the developing wing imaginal disc of the fruit fly\n\\textit{Drosophila}, distinguishing three transport regimes: transport by\nextracellular diffusion, transport by transcytosis and a regime where both\ntransport mechanisms are combined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2019 13:41:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 2022 01:12:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

IoT objects capable of handling\nmultiple sensing and actuating functions are the cornerstone of smart\napplications such as smart buildings, smart factories, home automation, and\nhealthcare automation. These smart applications express their demands in terms\nof high-level requests. These requests are characterised by the different\nrequirements of sensing actuating functions, processing and memory needs,\nactivation zones, latency, etc. In service-oriented architecture-based IoT,\napplication requests are translated into a business process BP workflow. In\nthis study, we model such a BP as a virtual network containing a set of virtual\nnodes and links connected in a specific topology. These virtual nodes represent\nthe requested processing and location where sensing or actuation are needed.\nThe virtual links capture the requested communication requirements between\nnodes. In this paper, we introduce a framework, optimised using mixed integer\nlinear programming MILP, that embeds the BPs from the virtual layer into a\nlower-level implementation at the IoT physical layer. The proposed framework\nresults in a physical plan that optimally allocates the processing needed and\nprovisions the sensing and actuation at the required locations requirements to\nan appropriate set of IoT nodes. The optimisation goal is to minimise the IoT\nlayer total power consumption and optimise the traffic distribution in a manner\nthat minimises the traffic latency of each IoT node. Our results show that the\nproposed framework enhances the network performance by reducing the power\nconsumption and latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2019 13:45:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

This paper\npresents a novel complex-valued deep fully convolutional neural network\n(CV-FCN) designed for PolSAR image classification. Specifically, CV-FCN uses\nPolSAR CV data that includes the phase information and utilizes the deep FCN\narchitecture that performs pixel-level labeling. It integrates the feature\nextraction module and the classification module in a united framework.\nTechnically, for the particularity of PolSAR data, a dedicated complex-valued\nweight initialization scheme is defined to initialize CV-FCN. It considers the\ndistribution of polarization data to conduct CV-FCN training from scratch in an\nefficient and fast manner. CV-FCN employs a complex\ndownsampling-then-upsampling scheme to extract dense features. To enrich\ndiscriminative information, multi-level CV features that retain more\npolarization information are extracted via the complex downsampling scheme.\nThen, a complex upsampling scheme is proposed to predict dense CV labeling. It\nemploys complex max-unpooling layers to greatly capture more spatial\ninformation for better robustness to speckle noise. In addition, to achieve\nfaster convergence and obtain more precise classification results, a novel\naverage cross-entropy loss function is derived for CV-FCN optimization.\nExperiments on real PolSAR datasets demonstrate that CV-FCN achieves better\nclassification performance than other state-of-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2019 15:03:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

The assumption of statistical\nequilibrium is typically used to obtain the atomic level populations from\nsnapshots of flare atmospheres, due to computational necessity. However it is\npossible that relying on statistical equilibrium could lead to spurious\nresults. We compare solving the atomic level populations via statistical\nequilibrium versus a non-equilibrium time-dependent approach. This was achieved\nusing flare simulations from RADYN alongside the minority species version,\nMS_RADYN, from which the time-dependent Mg II atomic level populations and\nradiation transfer were computed in complete frequency redistribution. The\nimpacts on the emergent profiles, lightcurves, line ratios, and formation\nheights are discussed. In summary we note that non-equilibrium effects during\nflares are typically important only in the initial stages and for a short\nperiod following the cessation of the energy injection. An analysis of the\ntimescales of ionisation equilibrium reveals that for most of the duration of\nthe flare, when the temperatures and densities are sufficiently enhanced, the\nrelaxation timescales are short ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{relax}}<0.1$ s), so that the\nequilibrium solution is an adequate approximation. These effects vary with the\nsize of the flare, however. In weaker flares effects can be more pronounced. We\nrecommend that non-equilibrium effects be considered when possible, but that\nstatistical equilibrium is sufficient at most stages of the flare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Sep 2019 15:20:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 01:56:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 15:26:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:57:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

Results: On publicly available multi-domain\ndatasets, the proposed method surpasses the top-scoring systems found in the\nliterature for heart sound abnormality detection (a binary classification\ntask). We utilized sensitivity, specificity, F-1 score and Macc (average of\nsensitivity and specificity) as performance metrics. Our systems achieved\nrelative improvements of up to 11.84% in terms of MAcc, compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods. Conclusion: The results demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed learnable filterbank CNN architecture in achieving robustness\ntowards sensor/domain variability in PCG signals.

To deal with network\nstructures, most existing works assume a given or enumerable set of meta-paths\nand then leverage them for the computation of meta-path-based proximities or\nnetwork embeddings. However, expert knowledge for given meta-paths is not\nalways available, and as the length of considered meta-paths increases, the\nnumber of possible paths grows exponentially, which makes the path searching\nprocess very costly.
