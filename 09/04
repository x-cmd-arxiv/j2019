However, understanding what makes compressed\nembeddings perform well on downstream tasks is challenging---existing measures\nof compression quality often fail to distinguish between embeddings that\nperform well and those that do not. We thus propose the eigenspace overlap\nscore as a new measure. We relate the eigenspace overlap score to downstream\nperformance by developing generalization bounds for the compressed embeddings\nin terms of this score, in the context of linear and logistic regression. We\nthen show that we can lower bound the eigenspace overlap score for a simple\nuniform quantization compression method, helping to explain the strong\nempirical performance of this method. Finally, we show that by using the\neigenspace overlap score as a selection criterion between embeddings drawn from\na representative set we compressed, we can efficiently identify the better\nperforming embedding with up to $2\\times$ lower selection error rates than the\nnext best measure of compression quality, and avoid the cost of training a\nmodel for each task of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 16:00:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 22:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-16"}

The faster the star rotates, its magnetic activity gets stronger but\nactivity cycle period does not show a straightforward variation with the\nrotation rate. For slowly rotating stars, the cycle period decreases with the\nincrease of rotation rate, while for the fast rotators dependency of cycle\nperiod on rotation is presently quite complicated. We aim to provide an\nexplanation of these observational trends of stellar magnetic activity using a\ndynamo model. We construct a theoretical dynamo model for stars of mass 1\n$M_\\odot$ based on the kinematic flux transport dynamo model including radial\npumping near the surface of the stars. The inclusion of this near surface\ndownward radial pumping is found to be necessary to match the observed surface\nmagnetic field in case of the Sun. The main ingredients of our dynamo model,\nmeridional circulation and differential rotation for stars are obtained from a\nmean-field hydrodynamic model. Our model shows a decrease of cycle period with\nincreasing rotation rate in the slowly rotating regime and a slight increase of\ncycle period with rotation rate for the rapid rotators. The strength of the\nmagnetic field is found to be increasing as the rotation rate of the star\nincreases. We also find that the parity of the stellar magnetic field changes\nwith rotation. According to our model, the parity flips to quadrupolar from\ndipolar if the rotation period of the star is less than 17 days.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 16:29:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

The present study is\nconcerned with the effect of flow confinement on Mach 2 laminar SBLI in\nrectangular ducts. An oblique shock generated by a 2 degree wedge forms a\nconical swept SBLI with sidewall boundary layers before reflecting from the\nbottom wall of the domain. Multiple large regions of flow-reversal are observed\non the sidewalls, bottom wall and at the corner intersection. The main\ninteraction is found to be strongly three-dimensional and highly dependent on\nthe geometry of the duct. Comparison to quasi-2D span-periodic simulations\nshowed sidewalls strengthen the interaction by 31% for the baseline\nconfiguration with an aspect ratio of one. The length of the shock generator\nand subsequent trailing edge expansion fan position was shown to be a critical\nparameter in determining the central separation length. By shortening the\nlength of the shock generator, control of the interaction and suppression of\nthe central interaction is demonstrated. Parametric studies of shock strength\nand duct aspect ratio were performed to find limiting behaviours. For the\nlargest aspect ratio of four, three-dimensionality was visible across 30% of\nthe span width away from the wall. Topological features of the\nthree-dimensional separation are identified and shown to be consistent with\n`owl-like' separations of the first kind.

Classical (voltage/current\nbut also flux/charge) models are easily obtained as particular cases of a\ngeneral homogeneous model. Our approach extends the results introduced for\nlinear circuits in a previous paper, by means of a systematic use of global\nparametrizations of smooth planar curves. This makes it possible to formulate\nreduced models in terms of homogeneous variables also in the nonlinear context:\ncontrary to voltages and currents (and also to fluxes and charges), homogeneous\nvariables qualify as state variables in reduced models of uncoupled circuits\nwithout any restriction in the characteristics of devices. The inherent\nsymmetry of this formalism makes it possible to address in broad generality\ncertain analytical problems in nonlinear circuit theory, such as the\nstate-space problem and related issues involving impasse phenomena, as well as\nindex analyses of differential-algebraic models.

Embedded\nfilaments are seen in the {\\it Herschel} column density map, and one of them is\nidentified as an elongated filamentary feature (FF) (length ~8.3 pc; mass ~1170\nMsun). Five Herschel clumps (Mclump ~45-300 Msun) are traced in the central\npart of FF, where an extended temperature structure (Td ~13.5-26.5 K) is\nobserved. In the direction of the central part of FF, the warmer region at Td\n~20-26.5 K spatially coincides with a mid-infrared (MIR) shell surrounding a\npreviously known evolved infrared cluster. Diffuse H-alpha emission is traced\ninside the infrared shell, suggesting the presence of massive stars in the\nevolved cluster. Based on the surface density analysis of young stellar objects\n(YSOs), embedded clusters of YSOs are traced toward the central part of FF, and\nare distributed around the infrared shell. Previously detected H2O masers, H2\nknots, massive protostar candidates, and HII region are also seen toward the\nembedded clusters. Using the 12CO and 13CO line data, the central part of FF is\nobserved at the overlapping zones of two filamentary molecular clouds (length\n~12.5 pc) around -20 and -17 km/s, which are also connected in velocity. Our\nobservational results suggest that the formation of massive stars appears to be\ntriggered by a collision of two filamentary molecular clouds, which might have\nalso influenced the birth of YSOs in AFGL 5157.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 16:42:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

The performance of this new\nmethod is tested on a sample of data collected by pointing MAGIC for a few days\nfrom March to May 2016 towards the direction of a multi-PeV neutrino that\nIceCube detected on June 11th 2014 (reconstructed direction (J2000.0) RA:\n110.34$^\\circ$ and Dec.: 11.48$^\\circ$).

An encoder causally\nobserves the Wiener process and decides when and what to transmit about it. A\ndecoder makes real-time estimation of the process using causally received\ncodewords. We determine the causal encoding and decoding policies that jointly\nminimize the mean-square estimation error, under the long-term communication\nrate constraint of $R$ bits per second. We show that an optimal encoding policy\ncan be implemented as a causal sampling policy followed by a causal compressing\npolicy. We prove that the optimal encoding policy samples the Wiener process\nonce the innovation passes either $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{R}}$ or\n$-\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{R}}$, and compresses the sign of the innovation (SOI) using a\n1-bit codeword. The SOI coding scheme achieves the operational distortion-rate\nfunction, which is equal to $D^{\\mathrm{op}}(R)=\\frac{1}{6R}$. Surprisingly,\nthis is significantly better than the distortion-rate tradeoff achieved in the\nlimit of infinite delay by the best non-causal code. This is because the SOI\ncoding scheme leverages the free timing information supplied by the zero-delay\nchannel between the encoder and the decoder. The key to unlock that gain is the\nevent-triggered nature of the SOI sampling policy. In contrast, the\ndistortion-rate tradeoffs achieved with deterministic sampling policies are\nmuch worse: we prove that the causal informational distortion-rate function in\nthat scenario is as high as $D_{\\mathrm{DET}}(R) = \\frac{5}{6R}$. It is\nachieved by the uniform sampling policy with the sampling interval\n$\\frac{1}{R}$. In either case, the optimal strategy is to sample the process as\nfast as possible and to transmit 1-bit codewords to the decoder without delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 17:19:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 16:49:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 22:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}

We analyzed multi-wavelength observations of iota Hor using\nXMM-Newton, TESS, and HST data. We monitored iota Hor throughout almost seven\nyears in X-rays and in two UV bands. The summed RGS and STIS spectra were used\nfor a detailed thermal structure model, and the determination of coronal\nabundances. We studied rotation and flares in the TESS light curve. We find a\nstable coronal cycle along four complete periods, more than covered in the Sun.\nThere is no evidence for a second longer X-ray cycle. Coronal abundances are\nconsistent with photospheric values, discarding any effects related to the\nfirst ionization potential. From the TESS light curve we derived the first\nphotometric measurement of the rotation period (8.2 d). No flares were detected\nin the TESS light curve of iota Hor. We estimate the probability of having\ndetected zero flares with TESS to be ~2%. We corroborate the presence of an\nactivity cycle of ~1.6 yr in iota Hor in X-rays, more regular than its Ca II\nH&K counterpart. A decoupling of the activity between the northern and southern\nhemispheres of the star might explain the disagreement.

We investigate transferring the learning acquired in one task to\na set of previously unseen tasks. Generalization and overfitting in deep\nreinforcement learning are not commonly addressed in current transfer learning\nresearch. Conducting a comparative analysis without an intermediate\nregularization step results in underperforming benchmarks and inaccurate\nalgorithm comparisons due to rudimentary assessments. In this study, we propose\nregularization techniques in deep reinforcement learning for continuous control\nthrough the application of sample elimination, early stopping and maximum\nentropy regularized adversarial learning. First, the importance of the\ninclusion of training iteration number to the hyperparameters in deep transfer\nreinforcement learning will be discussed. Because source task performance is\nnot indicative of the generalization capacity of the algorithm, we start by\nacknowledging the training iteration number as a hyperparameter. In line with\nthis, we introduce an additional step of resorting to earlier snapshots of\npolicy parameters to prevent overfitting to the source task. Then, to generate\nrobust policies, we discard the samples that lead to overfitting via a method\nwe call strict clipping. Furthermore, we increase the generalization capacity\nin widely used transfer learning benchmarks by using maximum entropy\nregularization, different critic methods, and curriculum learning in an\nadversarial setup. Subsequently, we propose maximum entropy adversarial\nreinforcement learning to increase the domain randomization. Finally, we\nevaluate the robustness of these methods on simulated robots in target\nenvironments where the morphology of the robot, gravity, and tangential\nfriction coefficient of the environment are altered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 17:57:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 07:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

For example, AGN-blown bubbles in hydrodynamic simulations are easily\ndisrupted by fluid instabilities, making it difficult to explain the coherence\nof observed bubbles such as the northwest ghost bubble in Perseus. In order to\ninvestigate whether magnetic tension and viscosity in realistic conditions\ncould preserve the bubble integrity, we performed the first\nBraginskii-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of jet-inflated bubbles in a medium\nwith tangled magnetic field.

Although unsuppressed anisotropic viscosity in tangled\nmagnetic field can have similar effects as isotropic viscosity, when the\npressure anisotropy is bounded by microscopic plasma instabilities, the level\nof viscosity is substantially limited, thereby failing to prevent bubble\ndeformation as in the inviscid case. Our results suggest that Braginskii\nviscosity is unlikely to be the primary mechanism for suppressing the fluid\ninstabilities for AGN bubbles, and it remains a challenging task to reproduce\nsmooth and coherent bubbles as observed.

We analysed ten years of\noptical spectroscopic data from the Steward Observatory for the blazar 3C\n454.3, as well as gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). The\noptical spectra are dominated by a highly variable non-thermal synchrotron\ncontinuum with a prominent Mg II broad emission line. The line flux was\nobtained by spectral decomposition including significant contribution from the\nFe II pseudo-continuum. Three methods were used to characterise variations in\nthe line flux: (1) stacking of the continuum-subtracted spectra, (2)\nsubtracting the running mean light curves calculated for different timescales,\nand (3) evaluating potential time delays via the discrete correlation function\n(DCF). Despite very large variations in the gamma-ray and optical continua, the\nline flux changes only moderately (< 0.1 dex). The data suggest that the line\nflux responds to a dramatic change in the blazar activity from a very high\nstate in 2010 to a deep low state in 2012. Two interpretations are possible:\neither the line flux is anti-correlated with the continuum or the increase in\nthe line luminosity is delayed by ~600 days.

This means modeling\nderailment as an emerging property of a conversation rather than as an isolated\nutterance-level event.\n  Forecasting emerging conversational properties, however, poses several\ninherent modeling challenges. First, since conversations are dynamic, a\nforecasting model needs to capture the flow of the discussion, rather than\nproperties of individual comments. Second, real conversations have an unknown\nhorizon: they can end or derail at any time; thus a practical forecasting model\nneeds to assess the risk in an online fashion, as the conversation develops. In\nthis work we introduce a conversational forecasting model that learns an\nunsupervised representation of conversational dynamics and exploits it to\npredict future derailment as the conversation develops.

Three classes of protocols\nare considered, parallel circuits, where the input-operations can be\nsimultaneously, adaptive circuits, where sequential uses of the\ninput-operations are allowed, and general protocols, where the use of the\ninput-operations may be performed without a definite causal order. For these\nthree classes, we develop a systematic semidefinite programming approach that\nfinds a circuit which obtains the desired transformation with the maximal\nsuccess probability. We then analyse in detail three particular\ntransformations; unitary transposition, unitary complex conjugation, and\nunitary inversion. For unitary transposition and unitary inverse, we prove that\nfor any fixed dimension $d$, adaptive circuits have an exponential improvement\nin terms of uses $k$ when compared to parallel ones. For unitary complex\nconjugation and unitary inversion we prove that if the number of uses $k$ is\nstrictly smaller than $d-1$, the probability of success is necessarily zero. We\nalso discuss the advantage of indefinite causal order protocols over causal\nones and introduce the concept of delayed input-state quantum circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 18:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 05:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-16"}

The sample consists of seven early-type\ngalaxies (ETGs) at $z\\sim0.05$, with central velocity dispersion in the range\n$300<\\sigma<350$km/s. Using state-of-art stellar population synthesis models,\nwe fit a number of spectral indices, from different chemical species (including\nTiO's and Na indices), to constrain the IMF slope (i.e. the fraction of\nlow-mass stars), as a function of galactocentric distance, over a radial range\nout to $\\sim4$kpc. ETGs in our sample show a significant correlation of IMF\nslope and surface mass density. The bottom-heavy population (i.e. an excess of\nlow-mass stars in the IMF) is confined to central galaxy regions with surface\nmass density above $\\sim 10^{10} M_\\odot kpc^{-2}$, or, alternatively, within a\ncharacteristic radius of $\\sim2$~kpc. Radial distance, in physical units, and\nsurface mass density, are the best correlators to IMF variations, with respect\nto other dynamical (e.g. velocity dispersion) and stellar population (e.g.\nmetallicity) properties. Our results for the most massive galaxies suggest that\nthere is no single parameter} that fully explains variations in the stellar\nIMF, but IMF radial profiles at z$\\sim$0 rather result from the complex\nformation and mass accretion history of galaxy inner and outer regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 18:11:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 17:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

The\nsignal-to-noise ratio for our lensing measurement ranges between 10.7 and 14.0\nfor the two void samples. We infer their 3D density profiles by fitting models\nbased on N-body simulations and find good agreement for void radii in the range\n15-85 Mpc. Comparison with their galaxy profiles then allows us to test the\nrelation between mass and light at the 10%-level, the most stringent test to\ndate. We find very similar shapes for the two profiles, consistent with a\nlinear relationship between mass and light both within and outside the void\nradius. We validate our analysis with the help of simulated mock catalogues and\nestimate the impact of photometric redshift uncertainties on the measurement.\nOur methodology can be used for cosmological applications, including tests of\ngravity with voids.

Maximum likelihood reconstruction\nof activity and attenuation (MLAA) was proposed to solve those issues by\nsimultaneously reconstructing tracer activity ($\\lambda$-MLAA) and attenuation\nmap ($\\mu$-MLAA) based on the PET raw data only.

A generic by-product of the\nturbulence evolution is the generation of a nonthermal particle spectrum with a\npower-law energy range. The power-law slope $p$ is harder for larger\nmagnetizations and stronger turbulence fluctuations, and it can be as hard as\n$p < 2$. The Larmor radius of particles at the high-energy cutoff is comparable\nto the size $l$ of the largest eddies. Plasmoid-mediated reconnection, which\nself-consistently occurs in the turbulent plasma, controls the physics of\nparticle injection. Then, particles are further accelerated by stochastic\nscattering off turbulent fluctuations. The work done by parallel electric\nfields - naturally expected in reconnection layers - is responsible for most of\nthe initial energy increase, and is proportional to the magnetization $\\sigma$\nof the system, while the subsequent energy gain, which dominates the overall\nenergization of high-energy particles, is powered by the perpendicular electric\nfields of turbulent fluctuations.

Along a one-dimensional locus on the conformal manifold, there can be\na transition point, across which the fermionic CFTs on the two sides differ by\nstacking an invertible fermionic topological order (IFTO), point-by-point along\nthe locus. At every point on the conformal manifold, the order and disorder\noperators have power-law two-point functions, but their critical exponents\ncross over with each other at the transition point, where stacking the IFTO\nleaves the fermionic CFT unchanged.

A common set of techniques for link prediction rely on similarity\nmetrics which use the topology of the observed subnetwork to quantify the\nlikelihood of unobserved links. Recently, similarity metrics for link\nprediction have been shown to be vulnerable to attacks whereby observations\nabout the network are adversarially modified to hide target links. We propose a\nnovel approach for increasing robustness of similarity-based link prediction by\nendowing the analyst with a restricted set of reliable queries which accurately\nmeasure the existence of queried links. The analyst aims to robustly predict a\ncollection of possible links by optimally allocating the reliable queries. We\nformalize the analyst problem as a Bayesian Stackelberg game in which they\nfirst choose the reliable queries, followed by an adversary who deletes a\nsubset of links among the remaining (unreliable) queries by the analyst.

Our\nresults show that light absorption in the visible spectral range is enhanced\nupon heating in both minerals but the rate of change in opacity with\ntemperature is a factor of six higher in ferropericlase.

A series of systems are simulated and characterized\nusing fractal dimensions, structure factors, coordination number distributions,\nbond-angle distributions and linear rheology.

A\npromising approach is to embed the high-dimensional observations into a\nlower-dimensional latent representation space, estimate the latent dynamics\nmodel, then utilize this model for control in the latent space. An important\nopen question is how to learn a representation that is amenable to existing\ncontrol algorithms? In this paper, we focus on learning representations for\nlocally-linear control algorithms, such as iterative LQR (iLQR). By formulating\nand analyzing the representation learning problem from an optimal control\nperspective, we establish three underlying principles that the learned\nrepresentation should comprise: 1) accurate prediction in the observation\nspace, 2) consistency between latent and observation space dynamics, and 3) low\ncurvature in the latent space transitions. These principles naturally\ncorrespond to a loss function that consists of three terms: prediction,\nconsistency, and curvature (PCC).

In\nparticular, many recent causal discovery methods make use of independent,\nnon-Gaussian noise to achieve identifiability of the causal models. Existence\nof hidden direct common causes, or confounders, generally makes causal\ndiscovery more difficult; whenever they are present, the corresponding causal\ndiscovery algorithms can be seen as extensions of overcomplete independent\ncomponent analysis (OICA). However, existing OICA algorithms usually make\nstrong parametric assumptions on the distribution of independent components,\nwhich may be violated on real data, leading to sub-optimal or even wrong\nsolutions. In addition, existing OICA algorithms rely on the Expectation\nMaximization (EM) procedure that requires computationally expensive inference\nof the posterior distribution of independent components.

This consists of a purely hydrodynamical mechanism in\nwhich, by breaking spherical symmetry, a radially accreting flow transitions\ninto an inflow-outflow configuration. The spherical symmetry is broken by\nconsidering that the accreted material is more concentrated on an equatorial\nbelt, leaving the polar regions relatively under-dense. What we have found is a\nflux-limited accretion regime in which, for a sufficiently large accretion\nrate, the incoming material chokes at a gravitational bottleneck and the excess\nflux is redirected by the density gradient as a bipolar outflow. The threshold\nvalue at which the accreting material chokes is of the order of the mass\naccretion rate found in the spherically symmetric case studied by Bondi and\nMichel. We describe the choked accretion mechanism first in terms of a general\nrelativistic, analytic toy model based on the assumption of an\nultrarelativistic stiff fluid. We then relax this approximation and, by means\nof numerical simulations, show that this mechanism can operate also for general\npolytropic fluids. Interestingly, the qualitative inflow-outflow morphology\nobtained appears as a generic result of the proposed symmetry break, across\nanalytic and numeric results covering both the Newtonian and relativistic\nregimes. The qualitative change in the resulting steady state flow\nconfiguration appears even for a very small equatorial to polar density\ncontrast ($\\sim 0.1\\,\\%$) in the accretion profile.

Temporal Difference (TD) Learning -- a model-free RL method -- is\na leading account of the midbrain dopamine system and the basal ganglia in\nreinforcement learning. These algorithms typically learn a mapping from the\nagent's current sensed state to a selected action (known as a policy function)\nvia learning a value function (expected future rewards). TD Learning methods\nhave been very successful on a broad range of control tasks, but learning can\nbecome intractably slow as the state space of the environment grows. This has\nmotivated methods that learn internal representations of the agent's state,\neffectively reducing the size of the state space and restructuring state\nrepresentations in order to support generalization. However, TD Learning\ncoupled with an artificial neural network, as a function approximator, has been\nshown to fail to learn some fairly simple control tasks, challenging this\nexplanation of reward-based learning. We hypothesize that such failures do not\narise in the brain because of the ubiquitous presence of lateral inhibition in\nthe cortex, producing sparse distributed internal representations that support\nthe learning of expected future reward. The sparse conjunctive representations\ncan avoid catastrophic interference while still supporting generalization. We\nprovide support for this conjecture through computational simulations,\ndemonstrating the benefits of learned sparse representations for three\nproblematic classic control tasks: Puddle-world, Mountain-car, and Acrobot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 06:58:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-05"}

Existing\ntheoretical approaches attempt to determine the coefficients in order for\nregularized empirical objectives to be upper-bounds of true objectives,\nuniformly over a hypothesis space. Such an approach is, however, known to be\nover-conservative, especially in high-dimensional settings with large\nhypothesis space. In fact, an existing generalization error bound in\nvariance-based regularization is $O(\\sqrt{d \\log n/n})$, where $d$ is the\ndimension of hypothesis space, and thus the number of samples required for\nconvergence linearly increases with respect to $d$. This paper proposes an\nalgorithm that calculates regularization coefficient, one which results in\nfaster convergence of generalization error $O(\\sqrt{\\log n/n})$ and whose\nleading term is independent of the dimension $d$. This faster convergence\nwithout dependence on the size of the hypothesis space is achieved by means of\nempirical hypothesis space reduction, which, with high probability,\nsuccessfully reduces a hypothesis space without losing the true optimum\nsolution.

In the classical finite volume type WENO schemes,\nthe linear weights for the candidate stencils are obtained by solving linear\nsystems at Gaussian quadrature points of cell interface. For the\nthree-dimensional scheme, such operations at twenty-four Gaussian quadrature\npoints of a hexahedron would reduce the efficiency greatly, especially for the\nmoving-mesh computation. Another drawback of classical WENO schemes is the\nappearance of negative weights with irregular local topology, which affect the\nrobustness of spatial reconstruction. In such three-dimensional WENO-AO scheme,\na simple strategy of selecting big stencil and sub-stencils for reconstruction\nis proposed. With the reconstructed quadratic polynomial from big stencil and\nlinear polynomials from sub-stencils, the linear weights are chosen as positive\nnumbers with the requirement that their sum equals one and be independent of\nlocal mesh topology. With such WENO reconstruction, a high-order gas-kinetic\nscheme (HGKS) is developed for both three-dimensional inviscid and viscous\nflows.

Hypernymy, also known as is-a relation or\nsubclass-of relation, lays in the core of many knowledge graphs and benefits\nmany downstream applications. Existing methods of hypernymy discovery either\nleverage textual patterns to extract explicitly mentioned hypernym-hyponym\npairs, or learn a distributional representation for each term of interest based\nits context. These approaches rely on statistical signals from the textual\ncorpus, and their effectiveness would therefore be hindered when the signals\nfrom the corpus are not sufficient for all terms of interest. In this work, we\npropose to discover hypernymy in text-rich HINs, which can introduce additional\nhigh-quality signals.

HyperMine extends the definition of context\nto the scenario of text-rich HIN. For example, we can define typed nodes and\ncommunities as contexts. These contexts encode signals of different\ngranularities and we feed them into a hypernymy inference model. HyperMine\nlearns this model using weak supervision acquired based on high-precision\ntextual patterns.

This can be motivated, for\ninstance, by wireless networks in which we combine direct device-to-device\ncommunication (e.g., using WiFi) with communication via a shared infrastructure\n(like base stations, the cellular network, or satellites).\n  Typically, communication over short-range connections is cheaper and can be\ndone at a much higher rate. Hence, we are focusing here on the LOCAL model (in\nwhich the nodes can exchange an unbounded amount of information in each round)\nfor the local connections while for the global communication we assume the\nso-called node-capacitated clique model, where in each round every node can\nexchange only $O(\\log n)$-bit messages with just $O(\\log n)$ other nodes.\n  In order to explore the power of combining local and global communication, we\nstudy the impact of hybrid communication on the complexity of computing\nshortest paths in the graph given by the local connections.

Parts of these systems are\ncomprised of short-range wireless networks in the form of clusters that\ncollectively cover a large geographical area. In these clusters, the nodes that\nrepresent the cluster heads need to deal with two types of communications: one\nis within the cluster and the other is from the cluster to the sink node. As\nthe number of clusters increases, it takes multiple hops for the cluster head\nto forward data to the sink node, thus resulting in a low packet delivery rate\nand throughput. To solve this problem, we propose a heterogeneous area network\nin which the cluster head is equipped with two types of radios: the IEEE\n802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 radios. The former is for the devices within the\ncluster to communicate, whereas the latter is for the cluster heads to\ncommunicate to the sink node. Although the IEEE 802.11 links increase the link\ncapacity, the IEEE 802.11 radio and the IEEE 802.15.4 radio might share the 2.4\nGHz unlicensed band, thus giving rise to the inter-network collisions or\ninterference. To tackle this problem and to maintain decent Qualityof-Service\n(QoS) for the network, we subsequently present two interference mitigation\ntechniques, in which a Blank Burst (BB) period is proposed so that the IEEE\n802.15.4 radios can be suspended while the IEEE 802.11 radios are active.\nSimulation results show the proposed two methods can effectively mitigate the\ninter-network collisions and are superior to the existing technique, which uses\nan adaptive aggregation technique to mitigate the inter-network collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 07:55:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-05"}

Generally, proposal-free\nmethods generate instance-agnostic semantic segmentation labels and\ninstance-aware features to group pixels into different object instances.\nHowever, previous methods mostly employ separate modules for these two\nsub-tasks and require multiple passes for inference. We argue that treating\nthese two sub-tasks separately is suboptimal. In fact, employing multiple\nseparate modules significantly reduces the potential for application. The\nmutual benefits between the two complementary sub-tasks are also unexplored. To\nthis end, this work proposes a single-shot proposal-free instance segmentation\nmethod that requires only one single pass for prediction. Our method is based\non a pixel-pair affinity pyramid, which computes the probability that two\npixels belong to the same instance in a hierarchical manner. The affinity\npyramid can also be jointly learned with the semantic class labeling and\nachieve mutual benefits. Moreover, incorporating with the learned affinity\npyramid, a novel cascaded graph partition module is presented to sequentially\ngenerate instances from coarse to fine. Unlike previous time-consuming graph\npartition methods, this module achieves $5\\times$ speedup and 9% relative\nimprovement on Average-Precision (AP).

It is suggested that once such a transition occurs, the\nmobile dislocation density will increase deterministically, leading to\nelectrical breakdown. Model parametrization is achieved via microscopic\nanalysis of OFHC Cu cathode samples from the CERN CLIC project, allowing the\ncreation and depletion rates of mobile dislocations to be estimated as a\nfunction of the initial physical condition of the material and the applied\nelectric field.

Inspired by the success of RL\nalgorithms on Atari games, the idea is to develop new methods in a restricted\ngame world and then gradually move to more complex environments.

By utilising light impinging on both, front and back\nsides of the module, actual limitations of conventional monofacial solar\nmodules can be overcome at almost no additional costs. Optimising large-scale\nbifacial solar power plants with regard to minimum levelised cost of\nelectricity (LCOE), however, is challenging due to the vast amount of free\nparameters such as module inclination angle and distance, module and land\ncosts, character of the surroundings, weather conditions and geographic\nposition. We present a detailed illumination model for bifacial PV modules in a\nlarge PV field and calculate the annual energy yield exemplary for two\nlocations with different climates. By applying the Bayesian optimisation\nalgorithm we determine the global minimum of the LCOE for bifacial and\nmonofacial PV fields at these two exemplary locations considering land costs in\nthe model.

In this work we follow the idea of inferring the\nmigration behavior of embedded planets by means of the characteristic radial\nstructures that they imprint in the disk's dust density distribution. We run\nhydrodynamical multifluid simulations of gas and several dust species in a\nlocally isothermal $\\alpha$-disk in the low-viscosity regime ($\\alpha=10^{-5}$)\nand investigate the obtained dust structures. In this framework, a planet of\nroughly Neptune mass can create three (or more) rings in which dust\naccumulates. We find that the relative spacing of these rings depends on the\nplanet's migration speed and direction. By performing subsequent radiative\ntransfer calculations and image synthesis we show that - always under the\ncondition of a near-inviscid disk - different migration scenarios are, in\nprinciple, distinguishable by long-baseline, state-of-the-art ALMA\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 09:48:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 10:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

The set of functions invoked by a test is called the\ntrace of the test, and the action of obtaining a trace is called tracing. There\nare many tracing tools since traces are useful for a variety of software\nengineering tasks such as test generation, fault localization, and test\nexecution planning. A major drawback in using test traces is that obtaining\nthem, i.e., tracing, can be costly in terms of computational resources and\nruntime. Prior work attempted to address this in various ways, e.g., by\nselectively tracing only some of the software components or compressing the\ntrace on-the-fly. However, all these approaches still require building the\nproject and executing the test in order to get its (partial, possibly\ncompressed) trace. This is still very costly in many cases. In this work, we\npropose a method to predict the trace of each test without executing it, based\nonly on static properties of the test and the tested program, as well as past\nexperience on different tests. This prediction is done by applying supervised\nlearning to learn the relation between various static features of test and\nfunction and the likelihood that one will include the other in its trace. Then,\nwe show how to use the predicted traces in a recent automated troubleshooting\nparadigm called Learn Diagnose and plan (LDP), instead of the actual,\ncostly-to-obtain, test traces. In a preliminary evaluation on real-world\nopen-source projects, we observe that our prediction quality is reasonable. In\naddition, using our trace predictions in LDP yields almost the same results\ncomparing to when using real traces, while requiring less overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 10:25:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 14:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

Some previous\nexperiments through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) have found zero-bias\nconductance peaks (ZBCP) within the vortex cores of Fe(Te,Se).

Starting from the mean-field equations, we explain the emergence of\nchaos by way of quasiperiodicity -- presence of two or more incommensurate\nfrequencies. This is known as the Ruelle-Takens-Newhouse route to chaos. The\nequations of motion have a $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-symmetry with respect to the\ninterchange of the two ensembles.

Using Floquet analysis, we show that\nquasiperiodicity is born out of non $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-symmetric oscillations via\na supercritical Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. Changing the detuning between the\nlevel spacings in the two ensembles and the repump rate results in the\nsynchronization of the two chaotic ensembles.

The interaction of this attractor with other attractors causes on-off\nintermittency until the synchronization manifold becomes sufficiently\nattractive.

The decrease of the inclination angle between between the spin\naxis and the magnetic axis can be responsible for such a high braking index.\nHowever, the physical mechanisms causing the change of the magnetic inclination\nangle have not been fully understood. In this Letter, we apply a two-dipole\nmodel given by Hamil et al (2016) to explain the decrease of the magnetic\ninclination angle of PSR J1640-4631. The rotation effect of a charged sphere\nand the magnetization of ferromagnetically ordered material produce magnetic\nmoments $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$, respectively. There exist a minimum of the\npotential energy for the magnetic moment $M_{2}$ in the magnetic field of\n$M_{1}$, hence the $M_{2}$ will freely rotate around the minimum energy\nposition (i. e equilibrium position), similar to a simple pendulum. Our\ncalculation indicate the magnetic moment $M_{2}$ would evolve towards alignment\nwith the spin axis for PSR J1640-4631, and cause the magnetic inclination angle\nto decrease. The single peak in the pulse profile favors a relatively low\nchange rate of the magnetic inclination angle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 11:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

This\nis different from the end-to-end attention mechanism used, and accounts for\nvarious unavoidable artifacts, in existing end-to-end speech synthesis systems\nsuch as Tacotron. Furthermore, DurIAN can be used to generate high quality\nfacial expression which can be synchronized with generated speech with/without\nparallel speech and face data. To improve the efficiency of speech generation,\nwe also propose a multi-band parallel generation strategy on top of the WaveRNN\nmodel.

We make use of a homogeneous, up-to-date data set with\nkinematics, structural properties, current and initial masses of 156 globular\nclusters. In general, cluster radii increase as the Milky Way potential\nweakens; with the core and Jacobi radii being those which increase at the\nslowest and fastest rate respectively. We interpret this result as the\ninnermost regions of globular clusters being less sensitive to changes in the\ntidal forces with the Galactocentric distance. The Milky Way's gravitational\nfield also seems to have differentially accelerated the internal dynamical\nevolution of individual clusters, with those toward the bulge appearing\ndynamically older. Finally we find a sub-population consisting of both compact\nand extended globular clusters (as defined by their rh/rJ ratio) beyond 8 kpc\nthat appear to have lost a large fraction of their initial mass lost via\ndisruption. Moreover, we identify a third group with rh/rJ > 0.4, which have\nlost an even larger fraction of their initial mass by disruption. In both cases\nthe high fraction of mass lost is likely due to their large orbital\neccentricities and inclination angles, which lead to them experiencing more\ntidal shocks at perigalacticon and during disc crossings. Comparing the\nstructural and orbital parameters of individual clusters allows for constraints\nto be placed on whether or not their evolution was relaxation or tidally\ndominated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 12:13:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Often, algorithms\nable to generate correlated noises reproducing the properties of real time\nseries produce \\textsl{Gaussian} outputs, while real, experimentally observed\ntime series are often non-Gaussian, and may follow distributions with a\ndiversity of behaviors concerning the support, the symmetry or the tail\nproperties. Here, we study how the correlation of two Gaussian variables\nchanges when they are transformed to follow a different destination\ndistribution. Specifically, we consider bounded and unbounded distributions,\nsymmetric and non-symmetric distributions, and distributions with different\ntail properties, from decays faster than exponential to heavy tail cases\nincluding power-laws, and we find how these properties affect the correlation\nof the final variables. We extend these results to Gaussian time series which\nare transformed to have a different marginal distribution, and show how the\nautocorrelation function of the final non-Gaussian time series depends on the\nGaussian correlations and on the final marginal distribution. As an application\nof our results, we propose how to generalize standard algorithms producing\nGaussian power-law correlated time series in order to create synthetic time\nseries with arbitrary distribution and controlled power-law correlations.\nFinally, we show a practical example of this algorithm by generating time\nseries mimicking the marginal distribution and the power-law tail of the\nautocorrelation function of a real time series: the absolute returns of stock\nprices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 12:21:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-05"}

The server assists in file delivery by transmitting a\nmessage of size $R$ over a shared error-free link and the goal is to\ncharacterize the optimal rate-memory trade-off. This setup was studied\npreviously by Hachem et al., where an achievable rate and an\ninformation-theoretic lower bound were derived. However, the multiplicative gap\nbetween them was shown to scale linearly with the access degree $L$ and thus\norder-optimality could not be established.\n  A series of recent works have used a natural mapping of the coded caching\nproblem to the well-known index coding problem to derive tighter\ncharacterizations of the optimal rate-memory trade-off under the additional\nassumption that the caches store uncoded content. We follow a similar strategy\nfor the multi-access framework and provide new bounds for the optimal\nrate-memory trade-off $R^*(M)$ over all uncoded placement policies. In\nparticular, we derive a new achievable rate for any $L \\ge 1$ and a new lower\nbound, which works for any uncoded placement policy and $L \\ge K/2$. We then\nestablish that the (multiplicative) gap between the new achievable rate and the\nlower bound is at most $2$ independent of all parameters, thus establishing an\norder-optimal characterization of $R^*(M)$ for any $L\\ge K/2$.

We give a simple algorithm to estimate the\nparameters (i.e., the weight matrix and bias vector of the ReLU neural network)\nup to an error $\\epsilon||W||_F$ using $\\tilde{O}(1/\\epsilon^2)$ samples and\n$\\tilde{O}(d^2/\\epsilon^2)$ time (log factors are ignored for simplicity).

We lack an\nexplanation of how such phenomena can emerge from simple rules of interaction\nbetween individuals. Here, we model transitions between different phases of\nleadership structure. We find a novel class of group dynamical behaviour where\nthere is a single leader who is quickly replaced when they lose status,\ndemonstrating a power vacuum.

In this paper, we investigate\nthe little-explored effect of the modeling capacity of a posterior density on\nthe disentangling ability of the VAE. We note that the independence within and\nthe complexity of the latent density are two different properties we constrain\nwhen regularizing the posterior density: while the former promotes the\ndisentangling ability of VAE, the latter -- if overly limited -- creates an\nunnecessary competition with the data reconstruction objective in VAE.\nTherefore, if we preserve the independence but allow richer modeling capacity\nin the posterior density, we will lift this competition and thereby allow\nimproved independence and data reconstruction at the same time. We investigate\nthis theoretical intuition with a VAE that utilizes a non-parametric latent\nfactor model, the Indian Buffet Process (IBP), as a latent density that is able\nto grow with the complexity of the data. Across three widely-used benchmark\ndata sets and two clinical data sets little explored for disentangled learning,\nwe qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated the improved disentangling\nperformance of IBP-VAE over the state of the art.

We show that this assumption, combined with an odds ratio\nparameterization of the joint density, enables identification of functionals of\ninterest, and we establish the semiparametric efficiency bound for the\nnonparametric model satisfying this assumption. We propose a practical\naugmented inverse probability weighted estimator, and in the setting with a\n(possibly high-dimensional) always-observed subset of covariates, our proposed\nestimator enjoys a certain double-robustness property.

Therefore, the scattering\nproblems by the multilayer embedded objects can be solved with the electric\nfield integral equation (EFIE).

We argue that conventional patient consent\nprotocols no longer work. Indeed robots that replace human surgeons take on an\nextraordinary level of responsibility. Surgeons undergo years of training and\npeer review in a strongly regulated environment, and derive trust via a\npatient's faith in the hospital system. Robots on the other hand derive trust\ndifferently, via the integrity of the software that governs their operation.\nFrom a privacy perspective, there are two fundamental shifts. First, the threat\nmodel has shifted from one where the humans involved were untrusted to one\nwhere the robotic software is untrusted. Second, the basic unit of privacy\ncontrol is no longer a medical record, but is replaced by four new basic units:\nthe subject on which the robot is taking action; the tools used by the robot;\nthe sensors (i.e data) the robot can access; and, finally access to monitoring\nand calibration services which afford correct operation of the robot. We\nsuggest that contextual privacy provides useful theoretical tools to solve the\nprivacy problems posed by surgical robots. However, it also poses some\nchallenges: not least that the complexity of the contextual-privacy policies,\nif rigorously specified to achieve verification and enforceability, will be\nexceedingly high to directly expose to humans that review contextual privacy\npolicies. A medical robot works with both information and physical material.\nWhile informational norms allow for judgements about contextual integrity and\nthe transmission principle governs the constraints applied on information\ntransfer, nothing is said about material property. Certainly, contextual\nprivacy provides an anchor for useful notions of privacy in this scenario and\nthus should be considered to be extended to cover both information and material\nflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 15:09:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-05"}

Intervalley backscattering\ncreates staggered pseudospin gaps in the superlattice barrier, which, combined\nwith the valley contrast in pseudospin chirality, determines the valley\npolarity of Klein tunneling.

A famous problem on the amenability of\nR.\\,Thompson's group $F$ is still open. What is known due to the result by Belk\nand Brown, is that the density of its Cayley graph in the standard set of group\ngenerators $\\{x_0,x_1\\}$, is at least $3.5$. This estimate has not been\nexceeded so far.

A function on a set $X \\subset\nA^n$ in an $n$-dimensional affine space is projectively self-concordant if and\nonly if it can be extended to an affinely self-concordant logarithmically\nhomogeneous function on the conic extension $K \\subset V^{n+1}$ of $X$ in the\n$(n+1)$-dimensional vector space obtained by homogenization of $A^n$.

A\nmagnon polaron can be formed at the intersection of the magnon and phonon\ndispersions, where their frequencies coincide.

We focus on the problem\nof what a designer should do if he/she has an algorithm that works correctly\nwith sequential consistency but is faced with an underlying key-value store\nthat provides a weaker consistency. We propose a detect-rollback based\napproach: The designer identifies a correctness predicate, say $P$, and\ncontinues to run the protocol, as our system monitors $P$. If $P$ is violated\n(because of weaker consistency), the system rolls back and resumes the\ncomputation at a state where $P$ holds.\n  We evaluate this approach with graph-based applications running on the\nVoldemort key-value store. Our experiments with deployment on Amazon AWS EC2\ninstances shows that using eventual consistency with monitoring can provide a\n$50\\%$ -- $80\\%$ increase in throughput when compared with sequential\nconsistency. We also observe that the overhead of the monitoring itself was low\n(typically less than $4\\%$) and the latency of detecting violations was small.\nIn particular, in a scenario designed to intentionally cause a large number of\nviolations, more than $99.9\\%$ of violations were detected in less than 50\nmilliseconds in regional networks, and in less than 3 seconds in global\nnetworks.\n  We find that for some applications, frequent rollback can cause the program\nusing eventual consistency to effectively \\textit{stall}. We propose alternate\nmechanisms for dealing with re-occurring rollbacks. Overall, for applications\nconsidered in this paper, we find that even with rollback, eventual consistency\nprovides better performance than using sequential consistency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 03:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-06"}

Methods for solving optimization\nproblems in large-scale machine learning, such as deep learning and deep\nreinforcement learning (RL), are generally restricted to the class of\nfirst-order algorithms, like stochastic gradient descent (SGD). While SGD\niterates are inexpensive to compute, they have slow theoretical convergence\nrates. Furthermore, they require exhaustive trial-and-error to fine-tune many\nlearning parameters. Using second-order curvature information to find search\ndirections can help with more robust convergence for non-convex optimization\nproblems. However, computing Hessian matrices for large-scale problems is not\ncomputationally practical. Alternatively, quasi-Newton methods construct an\napproximate of the Hessian matrix to build a quadratic model of the objective\nfunction. Quasi-Newton methods, like SGD, require only first-order gradient\ninformation, but they can result in superlinear convergence, which makes them\nattractive alternatives to SGD.

Their increasing complexity brings new challenges for the Sensor Fault\nDetection and Isolation (SFD-SFI) tasks. One of the key enablers for any\nSFD-SFI methods employed in modern complex sensor systems, is the so-called\nanalytical redundancy, which is nothing but building an analytical model of the\nsensors observations (either derived from first principles or identified from\nhistorical data in a data-driven fashion). In a nutshell, SFD amounts to\ngenerate and to monitor residuals by comparing the sensor measurements with the\nmodel predictions with the idea that the faulty sensors will result in large\nresiduals (i.e. the defective sensors generate measurement that are\ninconsistent with their expected behavior represented by the model). In this\npaper we introduce a disentangled Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the\nobjective to cope with the \\textit{smearing-out} effect, i.e. the propagation\nof a sensor fault to the non-faulty sensors resulting in large misleading\nresiduals. Moreover, the introduction of a probabilistic model for the residual\ngeneration allows us to develop a novel procedure for the identification of the\nfaulty sensors. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is\nlinear in the number of sensors as opposed to the combinatorial nature of the\nSFI problem. Finally, we empirically verify the performances of the proposed\nSFD-SFI architecture using a real data set collected at a petrochemical plant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 12:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-06"}

R-formants\nare zones of high magnitude frequencies in the low frequency (LF) long-term\nspectrum (LTS), rather like formants in the short-term spectra of vowels and\nconsonants. After an illustration of the method, an R-formant analysis is made\nof non-elicited extracts from public speeches. The LF-LTS of three domains, the\namplitude modulated (AM) absolute (rectified) signal, the amplitude envelope\nmodulation (AEM) and frequency modulation (FM, F0, 'pitch') of the signal are\ncompared. The first two correlate well, but the third does not correlate\nconsistently with the other two, presumably due to variability of tone, pitch\naccent and intonation. Consequently, only the LF LTS of the absolute speech\nsignal is used in the empirical analysis. An informal discussion of the\nrelation between R-formant patterns and utterance structure and a selection of\npragmatic variables over the same utterances showed some trends for R-formant\nfunctionality and thus useful directions for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 16:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-13"}

Practically, a network is highly\nspecialized and trained separately for each segmentation task. Instead of a\ncollection of multiple models, it is highly desirable to learn a universal data\nrepresentation for different tasks, ideally a single model with the addition of\na minimal number of parameters steered to each task. Inspired by the recent\nsuccess of multi-domain learning in image classification, for the first time we\nexplore a promising universal architecture that handles multiple medical\nsegmentation tasks and is extendable for new tasks, regardless of different\norgans and imaging modalities. Our 3D Universal U-Net (3D U$^2$-Net) is built\nupon separable convolution, assuming that {\\it images from different domains\nhave domain-specific spatial correlations which can be probed with channel-wise\nconvolution while also share cross-channel correlations which can be modeled\nwith pointwise convolution}. We evaluate the 3D U$^2$-Net on five organ\nsegmentation datasets. Experimental results show that this universal network is\ncapable of competing with traditional models in terms of segmentation accuracy,\nwhile requiring only about $1\\%$ of the parameters. Additionally, we observe\nthat the architecture can be easily and effectively adapted to a new domain\nwithout sacrificing performance in the domains used to learn the shared\nparameterization of the universal network. We put the code of 3D U$^2$-Net into\npublic domain. \\url{https://github.com/huangmozhilv/u2net_torch/}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 15:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-16"}
