Common orbit\ndetermination process noise techniques, such as state noise compensation and\ndynamic model compensation, require offline tuning and a priori knowledge of\nthe dynamical environment. Alternatively, the process noise covariance can be\nestimated through adaptive filtering. However, many adaptive filtering\ntechniques are not applicable to onboard orbit determination due to\ncomputational cost or the assumption of a linear time-invariant system.\nFurthermore, existing adaptive filtering techniques do not constrain the\nprocess noise covariance according to the underlying continuous-time dynamical\nmodel, and there has been limited work on adaptive filtering with colored\nprocess noise. To overcome these limitations, a novel approach is developed\nwhich optimally fuses state noise compensation and dynamic model compensation\nwith covariance matching adaptive filtering. This yields two adaptive and\ndynamically constrained process noise covariance estimation techniques. Unlike\nmany adaptive filtering approaches, the new techniques accurately extrapolate\nover measurement outages and do not rely on ad hoc methods to ensure the\nprocess noise covariance is positive semi-definite. The benefits of the\nproposed algorithms are demonstrated through two case studies: an illustrative\nlinear system and the autonomous navigation of two spacecraft orbiting an\nasteroid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 16:33:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2020 00:32:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 18:50:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 13 May 2021 23:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-17"}

Among the luminosity\nindicators explored, sequence C' is the narrowest in the P-Wrp diagram, and is\nthus to be preferred over the other PLDs for the determination of distances\nusing LPVs. The majority of massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and red\nsupergiants form a smooth extension of sequence C of low- and intermediate-mass\nAGB stars in the P-Wrp diagram, suggesting that they pulsate in the fundamental\nmode.

Our simulations establish the superior convergence\nproperties and computational efficiency of our algorithm as well as accuracy in\nterms of the canonical correlation and its ability to recover the supports of\nthe canonical directions.

The gaze intention is often modelled\nas fixation. However, when looking at an object, it is not natural and it is\ndifficult to maintain the gaze fixating on one point for a long time. Saccades\nmay happen while a human is still focusing on the object. The prediction of\nhuman intention will be lost during saccades. In addition, while the human\nintention is on object, the gazes may be located outside of the object bounding\nbox due to different noise sources, which would cause false negative\npredictions. In this work, we propose a novel approach to detect whether a\nhuman is focusing on an object in HRI application. We determine the gaze\nintention by comparing the similarity between the hypothetic gazes on objects\nand the actual gazes. We use Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to measure the\nsimilarity and 1 Nearest Neighbour to classify which object a human is looking\nat. Our experimental results indicate that, compare to fixation, our method can\nsuccessfully determine the human intention even during saccadic eye movements\nand increase the classification accuracy with noisy gaze data.

A theorem of\nSerra and Z\\'emor proves the conjecture provided $r\\leq 0.0001|A|$, without any\nadditional constraint on $|A|$. Subject to the mild additional constraint\n$|2A|\\leq 3p/4$ (which is optimal in a sense explained in the paper), our first\nmain result improves the bound on $r$, allowing $r\\leq 0.1368|A|$. We also\nprove a variant which further improves this bound on $r$ provided $A$ is\nsufficiently dense. We then give several applications. First we apply the above\nvariant to give a new upper bound for the maximal density of $m$-sum-free sets\nin $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$, i.e., sets $A$ having no solution $(x,y,z)\\in A^3$\nto the equation $x+y=mz$, where $m\\geq 3$ is a fixed integer. The previous best\nupper bound for this maximal density was $1/3.0001$ (using the Serra-Z\\'emor\nTheorem). We improve this to $1/3.1955$. We also present a construction\nfollowing an idea of Schoen, which yields a lower bound for this maximal\ndensity of the form $1/8+o(1)_{p\\to\\infty}$.

We obtained\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic observations with the FIES, Ond\\v{r}ejov, PARAS,\nTautenburg, and TRES spectrographs and measured the mass of TOI-503b to be $M_b\n= 53.7 \\pm 1.2 M_J$. The host star has a mass of $M_\\star = 1.80 \\pm 0.06\nM_\\odot$, a radius of $R_\\star = 1.70 \\pm 0.05 R_\\odot$, an effective\ntemperature of $T_{\\rm eff} = 7650 \\pm 160$K, and a relatively high metallicity\nof $0.61\\pm 0.07$ dex. We used stellar isochrones to derive the age of the\nsystem to be $\\sim$180 Myr, which places its age between that of RIK 72b (a\n$\\sim$10 Myr old brown dwarf in the Upper Scorpius stellar association) and AD\n3116b (a $\\sim$600 Myr old brown dwarf in the Praesepe cluster). We argue that\nthis brown dwarf formed in-situ, based on the young age of the system and the\nlong circularization timescale for this brown dwarf around its host star.\nTOI-503b joins a growing number of known short-period, intermediate-mass brown\ndwarfs orbiting main sequence stars, and is the second such brown dwarf known\nto transit an A star, after HATS-70b. With the growth in the population in this\nregime, the driest region in the brown dwarf desert ($35-55 M_J \\sin{i}$) is\nreforesting and its mass range shrinking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 19:53:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 21:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

A total\nof 12 massive (>500 $M_{\\odot}$), cold (<15 K), 3.6-70 $\\mu$m dark prestellar\nclump candidates, embedded in IRDCs, were carefully selected in the pilot\nsurvey to be observed with ALMA. We mosaiced each clump (~1 arcmin^2) in dust\nand line emission with the 12m/7m/TP arrays at 224 GHz, resulting in ~1.2\"\nresolution (~4800 AU). As the first paper of the series, we concentrate on the\ndust emission to reveal the clump fragmentation. We detect 294 cores, from\nwhich 84 (29%) are categorized as protostellar based on outflow activity or\n'warm core' line emission. The remaining 210 (71%) are considered prestellar\ncore candidates. The number of detected cores is independent of the mass\nsensitivity range of the observations. On average, more massive clumps tend to\nform more cores. We find a large population of low-mass (<1 M) cores and no\nhigh-mass (>30 $M_{\\odot}$) prestellar cores. The most massive prestellar core\nhas a mass of 11 $M_{\\odot}$. From the prestellar CMF, we derive a power law\nindex of 1.17+-0.1, slightly shallower than Salpeter (1.35). We use the MST\ntechnique to characterize the separation between cores and their spatial\ndistribution, and derive mass segregation ratios. While there is a range of\ncore masses and separations detected in the sample, the mean separation and\nmass of cores are well explained by thermal fragmentation and are inconsistent\nwith turbulent Jeans fragmentation. The core spatial distribution is well\ndescribed by hierarchical subclustering rather than centrally peaked\nclustering. There is no conclusive evidence of mass segregation. We test\nseveral theoretical conditions, and conclude that overall, competitive\naccretion and global hierarchical collapse scenarios are favored over the\nturbulent core accretion scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

In our model, competing suppliers are subject to yield\nuncertainty (they deliver less than ordered) and congestion (lead time\nuncertainty or, \"soft\" supply caps).

Robust\nPrincipal Component Analysis (RPCA) performs low-rank and sparse decomposition\nand accomplishes such a task when the background is stationary and the\nforeground is dynamic and relatively small. A fundamental issue with RPCA is\nthe assumption that the low-rank and sparse components are added at each\nelement, whereas in reality, the moving foreground is overlaid on the\nbackground. We propose the representation via masked decomposition (i.e. an\noverlaying model) where each element either belongs to the low-rank or the\nsparse component, decided by a mask. We propose the Masked-RPCA algorithm to\nrecover the mask and the low-rank components simultaneously, utilizing\nlinearizing and alternating direction techniques.

However, few existing risk assessment algorithms\nhandle occlusion and other sensory limitations effectively. This paper explores\nthe possibility of efficient risk assessment under occlusion via both forward\nand backward reachability. The proposed algorithm can not only identify where\nthe risk-induced factors are, but also be used for motion planning by executing\nlow-level commands, such as throttle. The proposed method is evaluated on\nvarious four-way highly occluded intersections with up to five other vehicles\nin the scene.

We present a framework that systematically generates a wide range of\noptimal trajectories and then provably stabilizes them for the full-order,\nnonlinear and hybrid dynamical models of quadrupedal locomotion. The gait\nplanning is addressed through a scalable nonlinear programming using direct\ncollocation and HZD. The controller synthesis for the exponential stability is\nthen achieved through the Poincar\\'e sections analysis. In particular, we\nemploy an iterative optimization algorithm involving linear and bilinear matrix\ninequalities (LMIs and BMIs) to design HZD-based controllers that guarantee the\nexponential stability of the fixed points for the Poincar\\'e return map. The\npower of the framework is demonstrated through gait generation and HZD-based\ncontroller synthesis for an advanced quadruped robot, ---Vision 60, with 36\nstate variables and 12 control inputs. The numerical simulations as well as\nreal world experiments confirm the validity of the proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 22:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-19"}

Our central finding is\nthat for bosons condensed in localized phase given by the DAA model, the\nresonant superradiant scattering is induced, for which the critical optical\npumping of superradiant phase transition approaches zero, giving an instability\ndriven by Anderson localization. The superradiant phase for the DAA model with\nor without a mobility edge is investigated, showing that the localization\ndriven superradiant instability is in sharp contrast to the superradiance as\nwidely observed for Bose condensate in extended states, and should be\ninsensitive to temperature of the system.

In the context of nonlinear optics, both Kerr\nand Raman processes are considered local, meaning that optical fields at one\nlocation do not produce a nonlinear response at distinct locations in space.\nThis is because the electronic and phononic disturbances produced within the\nmaterial are confined to a region that is smaller than an optical wavelength.\nBy comparison, Brillouin interactions can result in a highly nonlocal nonlinear\nresponse, as the elastic waves generated through the Brillouin process can\noccupy a region in space much larger than an optical wavelength. The\nnonlocality of these interactions can be exploited to engineer new types of\nprocesses, where highly delocalized phonon modes serve as an engineerable\nchannel that mediates scattering processes between light waves propagating in\ndistinct optical waveguides. These types of nonlocal optomechanical responses\nhave been recently demonstrated as the basis for information transduction,\nhowever the nontrivial dynamics of such systems has yet to be explored. In this\nwork, we show that the third-order nonlinear process resulting from spatially\nextended Brillouin-active phonon modes involves mixing products from spatially\nseparated, optically decoupled waveguides, yielding a nonlocal\n'joint-susceptibility'. We further explore the coupling of multiple acoustic\nmodes and show that multi-mode acoustic interference enables a tailorable\nnonlocal-nonlinear susceptibility, exhibiting a multi-pole frequency response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 22:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

The evolution of\nthese networks is often non-Markovian, and the dynamics of their links\ncorrelated. Hence, to accurately model these networks, predict their evolution,\nand understand how information and other quantities propagate over them, the\ninclusion of both memory and dynamical dependencies between links is key. We\nhere introduce a general class of models of temporal networks based on discrete\nautoregressive processes. As a case study we concentrate on a specific model\nwithin this class, generating temporal networks with a specified underlying\nbackbone, and with precise control over the dynamical dependencies between\nlinks and the strength and length of their memories. In this network model the\npresence of each link is influenced by its own past activity and the past\nactivities of other links, as specified by a coupling matrix, which directly\ncontrols the causal relations and correlations among links. We propose a method\nfor estimating the models parameters and how to deal with heterogeneity and\ntime-varying patterns, showing how the model allows for a more realistic\ndescription of real world temporal networks and also to predict their\nevolution. We then investigate the role that memory and correlations in link\ndynamics have on processes occurring over a temporal network by studying the\nspeed of a spreading process, as measured by the time it takes for diffusion to\nreach equilibrium. Through both numerical simulations and analytical results,\nwe are able to separate the roles of autocorrelations and neighbourhood\ncorrelations in link dynamics, showing that the speed of diffusion is\nnon-monotonically dependent on the memory length, and that correlations among\nneighbouring links can speed up the spreading process, while autocorrelations\nslow it down.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 22:52:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 15:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

High entropy alloys (HEAs),\nfor example, draw a fundamentally new concept to enable exploring unknown\nregions in phase diagrams. The exploration, however, is hindered by traditional\nmetallurgies based on liquid-solid transformation. Vapor-solid transformation\nthat is permissible on pressure-temperature phase diagrams, offers the most\nkinetically efficient pathway to form any desired alloy (e.g., HEA). Here, we\nreport that a technique called \"sparking mashups\", which involves a rapidly\nquenched vapor source and induces unrestricted mixing for alloying 55 distinct\ntypes of ultrasmall nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable compositions. Unlike\nthe precursor feed in wet chemistry, a microseconds-long oscillatory spark\ncontrols the vapour composition, which is eventually retained in the alloy NPs.\nThe resulting NPs range from binary to HEAs with marked thermal stability at\nroom temperature.

It has many applications\nin scientific computing including interpolation, super-resolution, and\nconstruction of special matrices applied in cryptography. Despite its numerous\napplications, the matrix is highly ill-conditioned where specialized treatments\nare considered for approximation such as conversion to Cauchy matrix, spectral\ndecomposition, and algorithmic tailoring of the numerical solutions. In this\npaper, we propose a generalized algorithm that takes arbitrary pairwise\n(non-repetitive) sample nodes for solving inverse Vandermonde matrix. This is\ndone in two steps: first, a highly balanced recursive algorithm is introduced\nwith $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ complexity to solve the combinatorics summation of the\nelementary symmetric polynomials; and second, a closed-form solution is\ntailored for inverse Vandermonde where the matrix' elements utilize this\nrecursive summation for the inverse calculations.

The NTK was also\nimplicit in some other recent papers [6,13,14]. In the overparametrization\nregime, a fully-trained deep neural network is indeed equivalent to the kernel\nregression predictor using the limiting NTK. And the gradient descent achieves\nzero training loss for a deep overparameterized neural network. However, it was\nobserved in [5] that there is a performance gap between the kernel regression\nusing the limiting NTK and the deep neural networks. This performance gap is\nlikely to originate from the change of the NTK along training due to the finite\nwidth effect. The change of the NTK along the training is central to describe\nthe generalization features of deep neural networks.\n  In the current paper, we study the dynamic of the NTK for finite width deep\nfully-connected neural networks. We derive an infinite hierarchy of ordinary\ndifferential equations, the neural tangent hierarchy (NTH) which captures the\ngradient descent dynamic of the deep neural network. Moreover, under certain\nconditions on the neural network width and the data set dimension, we prove\nthat the truncated hierarchy of NTH approximates the dynamic of the NTK up to\narbitrary precision. This description makes it possible to directly study the\nchange of the NTK for deep neural networks, and sheds light on the observation\nthat deep neural networks outperform kernel regressions using the corresponding\nlimiting NTK.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 00:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-19"}

In this work, we propose a global filter\npruning algorithm called Gate Decorator, which transforms a vanilla CNN module\nby multiplying its output by the channel-wise scaling factors, i.e. gate. When\nthe scaling factor is set to zero, it is equivalent to removing the\ncorresponding filter. We use Taylor expansion to estimate the change in the\nloss function caused by setting the scaling factor to zero and use the\nestimation for the global filter importance ranking. Then we prune the network\nby removing those unimportant filters. After pruning, we merge all the scaling\nfactors into its original module, so no special operations or structures are\nintroduced. Moreover, we propose an iterative pruning framework called\nTick-Tock to improve pruning accuracy. The extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approaches.

Existing\nadversarial domain adaptation methods either learn a single domain\ndiscriminator to align the global source and target distributions or pay\nattention to align subdomains based on multiple discriminators. However, in\nreal applications, the marginal (global) and conditional (local) distributions\nbetween domains are often contributing differently to the adaptation. There is\ncurrently no method to dynamically and quantitatively evaluate the relative\nimportance of these two distributions for adversarial learning. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel Dynamic Adversarial Adaptation Network (DAAN) to dynamically\nlearn domain-invariant representations while quantitatively evaluate the\nrelative importance of global and local domain distributions. To the best of\nour knowledge, DAAN is the first attempt to perform dynamic adversarial\ndistribution adaptation for deep adversarial learning. DAAN is extremely easy\nto implement and train in real applications. We theoretically analyze the\neffectiveness of DAAN, and it can also be explained in an attention strategy.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that DAAN achieves better classification\naccuracy compared to state-of-the-art deep and adversarial methods.

The majority of the\nobservations show polarization patterns that are consistent with\nself-scattering, especially at ALMA Band 7. The inferred sizes of the grains\nare typically of order 100 microns, which is very different from the millimeter\nsize commonly inferred from the dust opacity index beta. In an effort to\nresolve this discrepancy, we first introduced the so-called \"Coplanar Isotropic\nRadiation Field\" approximation, which enables the computation of the (signed)\npolarization fraction analytically. With an oft-adopted dust composition (used,\ne.g., by DSHARP), we find that models with big dust grains produce very small\npolarization with reversed orientation, which hasn't been observed. The\nsemi-analytic results are validated through Monte Carlo radiative transfer\nsimulations. In these models, the \"correct\" polarization orientation and the\nsmall beta index are mutually exclusive. To resolve this tension, we explore a\nwide range of dust models, parameterized by their complex refractive index. We\nfind that both the fraction of the polarization and whether it is reversed or\nnot depend on the refractive index in a complex way, and this dependence is\nmapped out on an n-k plane for a representative dust size distribution (MRN\nwith amax=3mm) and wavelength of 870 microns. In particular, refractory\norganics dust grains produce reversed polarization, whereas grains of the same\nsize but made of absorptive carbonaceous materials can produce a percent-level\npolarization that is not reversed; the latter may alleviate the tension between\nthe grain sizes inferred from the scattering-induced polarization and the\nopacity index beta. We conclude that scattering-induced polarization has the\npotential to probe not only the sizes of the grains but also their composition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 03:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-19"}

In general, VoI\nrelates to acquiring additional information to improve decision-making based on\nprobabilistic reasoning in an uncertain system. This paper presents a framework\nfor acquiring information based on VoI in uncertain systems modeled as\nProbabilistic Logic Programs (PLPs).

At the same time, it employs quantum\nphenomena to improve detection, identification, and resolution capabilities.\nHowever, the entanglement is so fragile, unstable, and difficult to create and\nto preserve for a long time. Also, more importantly, the entangled states have\na tendency to leak away as a result of noise. The points mentioned above\nenforces that the entangled states should be carefully studied at each step of\nthe quantum radar detection processes as follows. Firstly, the creation of the\nentanglement between microwave and optical photons into the tripartite system\nis realized. Secondly, the entangled microwave photons are intensified.\nThirdly, the intensified photons are propagated into the atmosphere\n(attenuation medium) and reflected from a target. Finally, the backscattered\nphotons are intensified before the detection. At each step, the parameters\nrelated to the real mediums and target material can affect the entangled states\nto leak away easily. In this article, the entanglement behavior of a designed\nquantum radar is specifically investigated. In this study, the quantum\nelectrodynamics theory is generally utilized to analyze the quantum radar\nsystem to define the parameters influencing the entanglement behavior. The\ntripartite system dynamics of equations of motions are derived using the\nquantum canonical conjugate method. The results of simulations indicate that\nthe features of the tripartite system and the amplifier are designed in such a\nway to lead the detected photons to remain entangled with the optical modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 07:07:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-19"}

These advances include modularising the underlying\narchitecture and the incorporation of datasets from a second organism (mouse).\nIn addition, we introduce a number of data analytics tools that operate on\nthese datasets and are bundled in the analysis package: bio_analytics. Emphasis\nin both packages is on ease of installation and use. We highlight the general\narchitecture of our components based approach. An experimental graphical user\ninterface via SWISH for local installation is also available. Finally, we\nadvocate that biological data analytics is a fertile area which can drive\nfurther innovation in applied logic programming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 07:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-19"}

Using the star formation time-scale and the total baryonic mass\nconstrained by the data in the literature, we calculate the evolution of grain\nsize distribution. To explain the total dust masses in ALMA-detected $z>7$\ngalaxies, the following two solutions are possible: (i) high dust condensation\nefficiency in stellar ejecta, and (ii) efficient accretion (dust growth by\naccreting the gas-phase metals in the interstellar medium). We find that these\ntwo scenarios predict significantly different grain size distributions: in (i),\nthe dust is dominated by large grains ($a\\gtrsim 0.1~\\mu$m, where $a$ is the\ngrain radius), while in (ii), the small-grain ($a\\lesssim 0.01~\\mu$m) abundance\nis significantly enhanced by accretion. Accordingly, extinction curves are\nexpected to be much steeper in (ii) than in (i).

When the\nenergy of a photoexcited electron exceeds the band offset energy at the\ngraphene/MoS2 interface, the electron transfer occurs from graphene to the\nconduction band of MoS2, and the hole remains in graphene. This creates an\nelectron-hole separation at the graphene/MoS2 interface at cyclotron resonance\nand a photovoltage is generated. The proposed method is an infrared\nphotodetection technique through out-of-plane transport at the vdW junction,\nwhich is distinct from the previously reported methods that use in-plane\ntransport in graphene for electronic detection of the cyclotron resonance.\nDespite the simple structure of our device with a single-vdW junction, our\nmethod exhibits a very high sensitivity of about 10^6 V/W, which shows an\nimprovement of three orders of magnitude over the previously reported values.\nTherefore, the proposed method displays a high potential for cyclotron\nresonance-based infrared photodetector applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 07:41:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-01"}

To combat the\ndelay spread effect, multicarrier modulation (MCM) such as orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiplexing (OFDM) and its universal filtered variant (UF-OFDM) is\nemployed, leading to the simple per-subcarrier one tap equalization. The\ntime-varying nature of the channel, in particular, the\nintra-multicarrier-symbol channel variation induces spectral broadening and\nthus inter-carrier interference (ICI). Existing works address both effects\nseparately, focus on the one effect while ignoring the respective other.

Due to the gas poor environment and the\nlimited spatial resolution in observations they may hide in the center of many\na galaxy. However, a close encounter of a star with one of the supermassive\nblack holes (SMBHs) may tidally disrupt it to produce a tidal disruption event\n(TDE) and temporarily light up the SMBH. In a previous work, we investigated\nwith direct N-BODY simulations the evolution of TDE rates of SMBHB systems in\ngalaxy mergers of equal mass. In this work we extend to unequal mass mergers.\nOur results show that, when two SMBHs are far away from each other, the TDE\nrate of each host galaxy is similar as in an isolated galaxy. As the two\ngalaxies and their SMBHs separation shrinks, the TDE rate is increasing\ngradually until it reaches a maximum shortly after the two SMBHs become bound.\nIn this stage, the averaged TDE rate can be enhanced by several times to an\norder of magnitude relative to isolated single galaxies. Our simulations show\nthat the dependence of the TDE accretion rate on the mass ratio in this stage\ncan be well fitted by power law relations for both SMBHs. After the bound SMBHB\nforms, the TDE rate decreases with its further evolution. We also find that in\nminor mergers TDEs of the secondary SMBH during and after the bound binary\nformation are mainly contributed by stars from the other galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 08:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

A\nkey driver of mean magnetic field growth is the turbulent electromotive force\n(EMF), which represents the influence of correlated small-scale (or\nfluctuating) velocity and magnetic fields on the mean field. The EMF is usually\nexpressed as a linear expansion in the mean magnetic field and its derivatives,\nwith the dynamo tensors as expansion coefficients.

For optimal solutions\nconcerning device performance and cost, a crucial element is the selection of a\nsuitable material system which could enable a large wavelength tunability,\nstrong light interaction and simple integration with the mainstream silicon\ntechnologies. The emerging GaBiAs alloys offer such promising features and may\nlead to a new era of technologies. Here, we apply million-atom atomistic\nsimulations to design GaBiAs/GaAs core-shell nanowires suitable for low-loss\ntelecom-wavelength photonic devices. The effects of internal strain, Bi\nComposition (x), random alloy configuration, and core-to-shell diameter ratio\n($\\rm \\rho_D$) are analysed and delineated by systematically varying these\nattributes and studying their impact on the absorption wavelength and charge\ncarrier confinement. The complex interplay between x and $\\rm \\rho_D$ results\nin two distinct pathways to accomplish 1.55 um optical transitions: either\nfabricate nanowires with $\\rm \\rho_D \\geq$ 0.8 and $x \\sim$15\\%, or increase\n$x$ to $\\sim$30\\% with $\\rm \\rho_D \\leq$ 0.4. Upon further analysis of the\nelectron hole wave functions, inhomogeneous broadening and optical transition\nstrengths, the nanowires with $\\rm \\rho_D \\leq$ 0.4 are unveiled to render\nfavourable properties for the design of photonic devices. Another important\noutcome of our study is to demonstrate the possibility of modulating the strain\ncharacter from a compressive to a tensile regime by simply engineering the\nthickness of the core region. The availability of such a straightforward knob\nfor strain manipulation would be highly desirable for devices involving\npolarisation-sensitive light interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 09:30:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 04:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

The focal-plane wavefront sensing (FPWFS) performance of\nthe vAPP and the algorithm are evaluated with numerical simulations, to test\nvarious photon and read noise levels, the sensitivity to the 100 lowest Zernike\nmodes and the maximum wavefront error (WFE) that can be accurately estimated in\none iteration.

The\navailable algorithms enabling such decompositions present severe efficiency\nlimitations and are an obstacle for the solution of large scale and high\ndimensional problems. Our main contribution is the improvement of the parallel\nefficiency of the parareal in time method. The parareal method is based on\ncombining predictions made by a numerically inexpensive solver (with coarse\nphysics and/or coarse resolution) with corrections coming from an expensive\nsolver (with high-fidelity physics and high resolution). At convergence, the\nalgorithm provides a solution that has the fine solver's high-fidelity physics\nand high resolution. In the classical version, the fine solver has a fixed high\naccuracy which is the major obstacle to achieve a competitive parallel\nefficiency. In this paper, we develop an adaptive variant that overcomes this\nobstacle by dynamically increasing the accuracy of the fine solver across the\nparareal iterations. We theoretically show that the parallel efficiency becomes\nvery competitive in the ideal case where the cost of the coarse solver is\nsmall, thus proving that the only remaining factors impeding full scalability\nbecome the cost of the coarse solver and communication time. The developed\ntheory has also the merit of setting a general framework to understand the\nsuccess of several extensions of parareal based on iteratively improving the\nquality of the fine solver and re-using information from previous parareal\nsteps.

Our first goal is to generalize this result\nfor every $w \\in C_q$ where $q > \\max\\{1,p\\}$ without using extrapolation\ntheory. Although the bounds we prove are new even in a qualitative sense, we\nalso give the quantitative bound with respect to the $C_q$ characteristic. Our\ntechniques rely on recent advances in sparse domination theory and we actually\nprove most of our estimates for sparse forms.\n  Our second goal is to continue the structural analysis of $C_p$ classes. We\nconsider some weak self-improving properties of $C_p$ weights and weak and\ndyadic $C_p$ classes. We also revisit and generalize a counterexample by\nKahanp\\\"a\\\"a and Mejlbro who showed that $C_p \\setminus \\bigcup_{q > p} C_q\n\\neq \\emptyset$.

The individual integers are\nsensitive data, yet the kth-ranked element is of mutual interest to the\nparties. Previous secure computation protocols for the kth-ranked element\nrequire a communication channel between each pair of parties. They do not scale\nto a large number of parties as they are highly interactive resulting in longer\ndelays. Moreover, they are difficult to deploy as special arrangements are\nrequired between each pair of parties to establish a secure connection. A\nserver model naturally fits with the client-server architecture of Internet\napplications in which clients are connected to the server and not to other\nclients. It can simplify secure computation by reducing the number of rounds,\nand as a result, improve its performance and scalability. In this model, there\nare communication channels only between each client and the server, while only\nclients provide inputs to the computation.

In some settings, the model and\nthe data to be classified may contain sensitive information belonging to\ndifferent parties. In this paper, we, therefore, address the problem of\nprivately evaluating a decision tree on private data. This scenario consists of\na server holding a private decision tree model and a client interested in\nclassifying its private attribute vector using the server's private model. The\ngoal of the computation is to obtain the classification while preserving the\nprivacy of both - the decision tree and the client input. After the\ncomputation, the classification result is revealed only to the client, and\nnothing else is revealed neither to the client nor to the server. Existing\nprivacy-preserving protocols that address this problem use or combine different\ngeneric secure multiparty computation approaches resulting in several\ninteractions between the client and the server. Our goal is to design and\nimplement a novel client-server protocol that delegates the complete tree\nevaluation to the server while preserving privacy and reducing the overhead.\nThe idea is to use fully (somewhat) homomorphic encryption and evaluate the\ntree on ciphertexts encrypted under the client's public key. However, since\ncurrent somewhat homomorphic encryption schemes have high overhead, we combine\nefficient data representations with different algorithmic optimizations to keep\nthe computational overhead and the communication cost low. As a result, we are\nable to provide the first non-interactive protocol, that allows the client to\ndelegate the evaluation to the server by sending an encrypted input and\nreceiving only the encryption of the result. Our scheme has only one round and\ncan evaluate a complete tree of depth 10 within seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 11:18:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-19"}

This softness often leads\nto complex behavior. In particular, ultrasoft systems under pressure\ndemonstrate polymorphism of complex crystal and quasicrystal structures.\nTherefore, it is of interest to investigate how different can be the structure\nof the fluid state in such systems at different pressures. Here we address this\nissue for the model liquid composed of particles interacting through the\nharmonic-repulsive pair potential. This system can form different crystal\nstructures as the liquid is cooled. We find that, at certain pressures, the\nliquid exhibits unusual properties, such as the negative thermal expansion\ncoefficient. Besides, the volume and the potential energy of the system can\nincrease during crystallization. At certain pressures, the system demonstrates\nhigh stability against crystallization and it is hardly possible to crystallize\nit on the timescales of the simulations. To address the liquid's structure at\nhigh pressures, we consider the scaled pair distribution function (PDF) and the\nbond-orientational order (BOO) parameters. The marked change happening with the\nPDF, as pressure increases, is the splitting of the first peak which is caused\nby the appearance of non-negligible interaction with the second neighbors and\nthe following rearrangement of the structure. Our findings suggest that\nnon-trivial effects, usually explained by different interactions at different\nspatial scales, can be observed also in one-component systems with simple\none-length-scale ultrasoft repulsive interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 11:36:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-19"}

QPT is a major quantum information processing tool,\nsince it especially allows one to characterize the actual behavior of quantum\ngates, which are the building blocks of quantum computers. However, usual QPT\nprocedures are complicated, since they set several constraints on the quantum\nstates used as inputs of the process to be characterized. In this paper, we\nextend QPT so as to avoid two such constraints. On the one hand, usual QPT\nmethods requires one to know, hence to precisely control (i.e. prepare), the\nspecific quantum states used as inputs of the considered quantum process, which\nis cumbersome. We therefore propose a Blind, or unsupervised, extension of QPT\n(i.e. BQPT), which means that this approach uses input quantum states whose\nvalues are unknown and arbitrary, except that they are requested to meet some\ngeneral known properties (and this approach exploits the output states of the\nconsidered quantum process). On the other hand, usual QPT methods require one\nto be able to prepare many copies of the same (known) input state, which is\nconstraining. On the contrary, we propose \"single-preparation methods\", i.e.\nmethods which can operate with only one instance of each considered input\nstate. These two new concepts are here illustrated with practical BQPT methods\nwhich are numerically validated, in the case when: i) random pure states are\nused as inputs and their required properties are especially related to the\nstatistical independence of the random variables that define them, ii) the\nconsidered quantum process is based on cylindrical-symmetry Heisenberg spin\ncoupling.

Several countermeasures have\nbeen proposed in the literature in response to the arising threats, however,\nhurdle requirements imposed by the industry is hindering their adoption in\npractice. In particular, detecting attacks on IVNs is challenged by strict\nresource constraints and utterly complex communication patterns that vary even\nfor vehicles of the same model. In addition, existing solutions suffer from two\nmain drawbacks. First, they depend on the underlying vehicle configuration, and\nsecond, they are incapable of detecting certain attacks of a stealthy nature.\nIn this paper, we propose CASAD, a CAN-Aware Stealthy-Attack Detection\nmechanism that does not abide by the strict specifications predefined for every\nvehicle model and addresses key real-world deployability challenges.

However, models of lithospheric flexure reveal\ndifferences in lithospheric strength that are difficult to reconcile based on\nsuch flow laws. Recent rheological data from low-temperature deformation\nexperiments on olivine suggest that this discrepancy may be largely explained\nby strain hardening. Details of the mechanical data, specifically the effects\nof temperature-independent back stresses stored in the samples, indicate that\nstrain hardening in olivine occurs primarily due to long-range elastic\ninteractions between dislocations. These interpretations provided the basis for\na new flow law that incorporates hardening by development of back stress. Here,\nwe test this hypothesis by examining the microstructures of olivine samples\ndeformed plastically at room temperature either in a deformation-DIA apparatus\nat differential stresses of < 4.3 GPa or in a nanoindenter at applied contact\nstresses of > 10.2 GPa.

The stress heterogeneities and accumulations\nof dislocations along their slip planes are consistent with strain hardening\nresulting from long-range back-stresses acting between dislocations.

The oscillating volume\nwas shown to have a different shape at the distinct operating frequencies. The\nshape difference is governed by spin wave reflections at the grain boundaries.\nThe resulting non-linear behavior of the oscillator was shown to be a\ncollective effect of spin wave scattering at different locations within a few\nspin wavelengths from the nano-contact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 13:15:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-19"}

This result, however,\nis based on nearby, low-reddening Galactic GCs, for which we can obtain\naccurate F275W photometry. In this work we exploit $HST$ photometry in F336W,\nF438W, and F814W to characterize MPs in 68 Galactic and extragalactic GCs by\nusing the pseudo-color $C_{F336W,F438W,F814W}$, which is more efficient in\nterms of observation time than the pseudo-color $C_{F275W,F336W,F438W}$ adopted\nin previous works. We first analyzed the Galactic GCs alone and find that the\nRGB color width strongly correlates with [Fe/H]. After removing the dependence\nfrom metallicity, we obtain a strong correlation with cluster mass, thus\nconfirming previous findings. We then exploited the RGB width to compare MPs in\nGalactic and extragalactic GCs. Similarly to Galactic GCs, the RGB width of\nMagellanic Cloud GCs correlates with clusters mass, after removing the\ndependence from metallicity. This fact demonstrates that cluster mass is the\nmain factor affecting the properties of MPs. Magellanic Cloud clusters exhibit,\non average, narrower RGBs than Galactic GCs with similar mass and metallicity.\nWe suggest that this difference is a signature of stellar mass loss in Galactic\nGCs. As an alternative, the mass-RGB-width relation would depend on the host\ngalaxy.

To address those challenges, we propose a multi-level relation\ndetection strategy that utilizes human pose cues to capture global spatial\nconfigurations of relations and as an attention mechanism to dynamically zoom\ninto relevant regions at human part level. Specifically, we develop a\nmulti-branch deep network to learn a pose-augmented relation representation at\nthree semantic levels, incorporating interaction context, object features and\ndetailed semantic part cues. As a result, our approach is capable of generating\nrobust predictions on fine-grained human object interactions with interpretable\noutputs.

We systematize various theories of helical transport\nwith the help of the spin conservation analysis which allows one to single out\nsetups with the ballistic conductance being robustly protected regardless of\nthe electron backscattering. First, we briefly review different theories of\nedge transport in the QSH samples with and without the spin axial symmetry of\nthe electrons including those theoretical predictions which are not consistent\nwith the spin conservation analysis and, thus, call for a deeper study.

Another example focuses on\nthe effects of the space-fluctuating spin-orbit interaction on the QSH edge.

DMFT-based methods predict an enhancement of electronic\ncorrelations at the pressure-induced transition from body-centered cubic (bcc)\nalpha-Fe to hexagonal close-packed (hcp) epsilon-Fe. In particular, the\nelectronic effective mass, scattering rate and electron-electron contribution\nto the electrical resistivity undergo a step-wise increase at the transition\npoint.

We performed an initial critical assessment of the\nassumptions made by planet synthesis population models by looking at the\nrelation between mass accretion rates and disk masses in the models and in the\ncurrently available data. We find that the currently used disk models predict\nmass accretion rate in line with what is measured, but with a much lower spread\nof values than observed. This difference is mainly because the models have a\nsmaller spread of viscous timescales than what is needed to reproduce the\nobservations. We also find an overabundance of weakly accreting disks in the\nmodels where giant planets have formed with respect to observations of typical\ndisks. We suggest that either fewer giant planets have formed in reality or\nthat the prescription for planet accretion predicts accretion on the planets\nthat is too high.

Such methods typically require\nlarge amounts of labelled training data, which in the case of music consist of\nmixtures and corresponding instrument stems. However, stems are unavailable for\nmost commercial music, and only limited datasets have so far been released to\nthe public. It can thus be difficult to draw conclusions when comparing various\nsource separation methods, as the difference in performance may stem as much\nfrom better data augmentation techniques or training tricks to alleviate the\nlimited availability of training data, as from intrinsically better model\narchitectures and objective functions. In this paper, we present the\nsynthesized Lakh dataset (Slakh) as a new tool for music source separation\nresearch. Slakh consists of high-quality renderings of instrumental mixtures\nand corresponding stems generated from the Lakh MIDI dataset (LMD) using\nprofessional-grade sample-based virtual instruments. A first version,\nSlakh2100, focuses on 2100 songs, resulting in 145 hours of mixtures. While not\nfully comparable because it is purely instrumental, this dataset contains an\norder of magnitude more data than MUSDB18, the {\\it de facto} standard dataset\nin the field. We show that Slakh can be used to effectively augment existing\ndatasets for musical instrument separation, while opening the door to a wide\narray of data-intensive music signal analysis tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 15:14:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-19"}

Due\nto the in-situ computation capability, analog ReRAM crossbars yield significant\nthroughput improvement and energy reduction compared to traditional digital\nmethods. However, the power hungry analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) prevent\nthe practical deployment of ReRAM-based DNN accelerators on end devices with\nlimited chip area and power budget. We observe that due to the limited\nbit-density of ReRAM cells, DNN weights are bit sliced and correspondingly\nstored on multiple ReRAM bitlines. The accumulated current on bitlines resulted\nby weights directly dictates the overhead of ADCs. As such, bitwise weight\nsparsity rather than the sparsity of the full weight, is desirable for\nefficient ReRAM deployment. In this work, we propose bit-slice L1, the first\nalgorithm to induce bit-slice sparsity during the training of dynamic\nfixed-point DNNs. Experiment results show that our approach achieves 2x\nsparsity improvement compared to previous algorithms. The resulting sparsity\nallows the ADC resolution to be reduced to 1-bit of the most significant\nbit-slice and down to 3-bit for the others bits, which significantly speeds up\nprocessing and reduces power and area overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 15:19:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 19:04:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

First, the agent believes\nin discrimination against any group he is in more than an outsider does,\ncapturing widely observed self-centered views of discrimination. Second, the\nmore group memberships the agent shares with an individual, the more positively\nhe evaluates the individual. This explains one of the most basic facts about\nsocial judgments, in-group bias, as well as \"legitimizing myths\" that justify\nan arbitrary social hierarchy through the perceived superiority of the\nprivileged group. Third, biases are sensitive to how the agent divides society\ninto groups when evaluating outcomes. This provides a reason why some\nethnically charged questions should not be asked, as well as a potential\nchannel for why nation-building policies might be effective. Fourth, giving the\nagent more accurate information about himself increases all his biases. Fifth,\nthe agent is prone to substitute biases, implying that the introduction of a\nnew outsider group to focus on creates biases against the new group but lowers\nbiases vis a vis other groups. Sixth, there is a tendency for the agent to\nagree more with those in the same groups.

We\nanalyse dozens of transitions from deuterated methanol isotopologues coming\nfrom various existing observational datasets from the IRAM-PdBI and ALMA sub-mm\ninterferometers to estimate the methanol deuteration surrounding three low-mass\nprotostars on Solar System scales. A population diagram analysis allows us to\nderive a [CH$_2$DOH]/[CH$_3$OH] abundance ratio of 3-6 % and a\n[CH$_3$OD]/[CH$_3$OH] ratio of 0.4-1.6 % in the warm inner protostellar\nregions.

IMPTAM traces electrons of 10\n- 100 keV energies from the plasma sheet (L = 9 Re) to inner L-shell regions.\nThe flux evolution modeled by IMPTAM is used at the low energy and outer L*\ncomputational boundaries of the VERB code (assuming a dipole approximation) to\nperform radiation belt simulations of energetic electrons. The model was tested\non the March 17th, 2013 storm, for a six-day period. Four different simulations\nwere performed and their results compared to satellites observations from Van\nAllen probes and GOES. The coupled IMPTAM-VERB model reproduces evolution and\nstorm-time features of electron fluxes throughout the studied storm in\nagreement with the satellite data (within ~0.5 orders of magnitude). Including\ndynamics of the low energy population at L* = 6.6 increases fluxes closer to\nthe heart of the belt and has a strong impact in the VERB simulations at all\nenergies. However, inclusion of magnetopause losses leads to drastic flux\ndecreases even below L* = 3. The dynamics of low energy electrons (max. 10s of\nkeV) do not affect electron fluxes at energies >= 900 keV. Since the\nIMPTAM-VERB coupled model is only driven by solar wind parameters and the Dst\nand Kp indexes, it is suitable as a forecasting tool. In this study, we\ndemonstrate that the estimation of electron dynamics with\nsatellite-data-independent models is possible and very accurate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 13:50:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-20"}

The discovery of new phenomena with\nthe aid of recently developed experimental probes have led to various\nmodifications of these laws across disciplines and the scale spectrum: from\nsubatomic and elementary particle physics to cosmology and from atomistic and\nnano/micro to macro/giga scales. The emergence of nanotechnology and the\nfurther advancement of space technology are ultimately connected with the\ndesign of novel tools for observation and measurements, as well as the\ndevelopment of new methods and approaches for quantification and understanding.\nThe paper first reviews the author's previously developed weakly nonlocal or\ngradient models for elasticity, diffusion and plasticity within a unifying\ninternal length gradient (ILG) framework.

Most of the existing image\ncropping databases provide only one or several human-annotated bounding boxes\nas the groundtruths, which can hardly reflect the non-uniqueness and\nflexibility of image cropping in practice. The employed evaluation metrics such\nas intersection-over-union cannot reliably reflect the real performance of a\ncropping model, either. This work revisits the problem of image cropping, and\npresents a grid anchor based formulation by considering the special properties\nand requirements (e.g., local redundancy, content preservation, aspect ratio)\nof image cropping. Our formulation reduces the searching space of candidate\ncrops from millions to no more than ninety. Consequently, a grid anchor based\ncropping benchmark is constructed, where all crops of each image are annotated\nand more reliable evaluation metrics are defined. To meet the practical demands\nof robust performance and high efficiency, we also design an effective and\nlightweight cropping model. By simultaneously considering the region of\ninterest and region of discard, and leveraging multi-scale information, our\nmodel can robustly output visually pleasing crops for images of different\nscenes.

This work is the first unified\nframework where knowledge-based planning, RL, and human teaching jointly\ncontribute to the policy learning of an agent. Our experiments demonstrate that\nPACMAN leads to a significant jump-start at the early stage of learning,\nconverges rapidly and with small variance, and is robust to inconsistent,\ninfrequent, and misleading feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 07:06:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-23"}

They provide a way for users to take advantage of the\nbenefits of digital currencies, such as ability to transfer assets over the\ninternet, provide assurance on minting schedules and scarcity, and enable new\nasset classes, while also partially mitigating their volatility risks. In this\npaper, we systematically discuss general design, decompose existing stablecoins\ninto various component design elements, explore their strengths and drawbacks,\nand identify future directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 15:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}
