As such, searches for evidence of DM particles are being\ncarried out using a wide range of techniques, such as direct searches for DM\nparticles, searches for DM produced with colliders, and indirect searches for\nthe Standard Model annihilation products of DM. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies\n(dSphs) are excellent targets for indirect Dark Matter searches due to their\nrelatively high DM content and negligible expected astrophysical background. A\ncollaboration was formed to maximise the sensitivity of DM searches towards\ndSphs by combining for the first time dSph data from three imaging air\nCherenkov telescope (IACT) arrays: HESS, MAGIC, and VERITAS; the Fermi-LAT\nsatellite, and the water Cherenkov detector HAWC. Due to the diverse nature of\nthe instruments involved, each experiment will analyse their individual\ndatasets from multiple targets and then the results will be combined at the\nlikelihood level. For consistency of the likelihoods across the five\nexperiments, a common approach is used to treat the astrophysical factor\n(J-Factor) for each target and an agreed set of annihilation channels are\nconsidered. We also agree on a common statistical approach and treatment of\ninstrumental systematic uncertainties. The results are presented in terms of\nconstraints on the velocity-weighted cross section for DM self-annihilation as\na function of the DM particle mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 16:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-18"}

As the capillary\nwave packets experience little damping and exhibit non-linear behavior they can\npropagate a soliton excitation. The orientation of water dipoles by the high\nelectric fields up to about 10 million V/m in the about 1 nm thin layer\nadjacent to the elastic neuron membrane causes radial forces that modulate the\ndiameter of the nerve cell with a change of the voltage bias across the cell\nmembrane, caused, e. g., by local injection of ions.

This economy of sites and the absence of explicit\nsolvent particles enable molecular dynamics simulations of bolaamphiphiles to\nachieve mesoscopic length and time-scales unattainable by any bead-spring model\nor explicit solvent computations. The model applies to generic bolas only,\nsince the gain in scale can only be obtained by sacrificing the resolution of\ndetailed molecular structure. Thanks to dual-sites, however, (as opposed to a\nsingle-site model) our model can incorporate the essential flexibility of bolas\nthat leads to their U-conformers. The model bolas show successful self-assembly\ninto experimentally observed nano-structures like micelles, rods, lamellae etc.\nand retain fluidity in very stable monolayers. Presence of membrane-spanning\nmodel bolas in bilayers of model monopolar amphiphiles increases the stability\nand impermeability of the lamellar phase. Model bolas are also seen to be less\ndiffusive and to produce thicker layers compared to their monopolar\ncounterparts. Rigid model bolas, though achiral themselves, show self-assembly\ninto helical rods. As all these observations agree with the well-known key\ncharacteristics of archaeal lipids and synthetic bolaamphiphiles, our model\npromises to be effective for studies of bolas in context of biomimetics,\ndrug-delivery and low molecular weight hydrogelators. To the best of our\nknowledge, no other single or dual-site, solvent-free model for bolas has been\nreported thus far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 17:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-19"}

Among short-period (<1 day) binary\ncharacteristics, age remains one of the most difficult to measure. In this\npaper, we constrain the lifetime of short-period binaries through their\nkinematics. With the kinematic information from Gaia Data Release 2 and light\ncurves from {\\it Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer} (WISE), we investigate\nthe eclipsing binary fraction as a function of kinematics for a volume-limited\nmain-sequence sample. We find that the eclipsing binary fraction peaks at a\ntangential velocity of $10^{1.3-1.6}$ km/s, and decreases towards both low and\nhigh velocity end. This implies that thick disk and halo stars have eclipsing\nbinary fraction $\\gtrsim 10$ times smaller than the thin-disk stars. This is\nfurther supported by the dependence of eclipsing binary fraction on the\nGalactic latitude. Using Galactic models, we show that our results are\ninconsistent with any known dependence of binary fraction on metallicity.\nInstead, our best-fit models suggest that the formation of these short-period\nbinaries is delayed by 0.6-3 Gyr, and the disappearing time is less than the\nage of the thick disk. The delayed formation time of $\\gtrsim0.6$ Gyr implies\nthat these short-period main-sequence binaries cannot be formed by pre-main\nsequence interaction and the Kozai-Lidov mechanism alone, and suggests that\nmagnetic braking plays a key role in their formation. Because the main-sequence\nlifetime of our sample is longer than 14 Gyr, if the disappearance of\nshort-period binaries in the old population is due to their finite lifetime,\nour results imply that most ($\\gtrsim90$%) short-period binaries in our sample\nmerge during their main-sequence stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 03:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-05"}

This paper\nis devoted to the study of a parameterized family of divergence form elliptic\noperators that arise as the large data limit of graph Laplacians. The link\nbetween a three-parameter family of graph Laplacians and a three-parameter\nfamily of differential operators is explained. The spectral properties of these\ndifferential operators are analyzed in the situation where the data comprises\ntwo nearly separated clusters, in a sense which is made precise.

This paper is a brief review of the existing\nimage inpainting approaches we first present a global vision on the existing\nmethods for image inpainting.

In the\nlatter case we use a combination of Lin's method, the HKI, and the Krein matrix\nto study the spectrum associated with $n$-pulses for a second-order-in-time\nHamiltonian system which is used to model the dynamics of a suspension bridge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 19:07:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2020 21:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

While the analysis\nand the understanding of graph structures have been a central area of study in\nalgorithm design, the rapid increase of data sets over the last decades has\nposed new challenges for designing efficient algorithms that process\nlarge-scale graphs. These challenges arise from two usual assumptions in\nclassical algorithm design, namely that graphs are static and that they fit\ninto a single machine. However, in many application domains, graphs are subject\nto frequent changes over time, and their massive size makes them infeasible to\nbe stored in the memory of a single machine.\n  Driven by the need to devise new tools for overcoming such challenges, this\nthesis focuses on two areas of modern algorithm design that directly deal with\nprocessing massive graphs, namely dynamic graph algorithms and graph\nsparsification. We develop new algorithmic techniques from both dynamic and\nsparsification perspective for a multitude of graph-based optimization problems\nwhich lie at the core of Spectral Graph Theory, Graph Partitioning, and Metric\nEmbeddings. Our algorithms are faster than any previous one and design smaller\nsparsifiers with better (approximation) quality. More importantly, this work\nintroduces novel reduction techniques that show unexpected connections between\nseemingly different areas such as dynamic graph algorithms and graph\nsparsification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 19:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}

We quantify the damping of energy in systems of multiple\nparticles in the 0.1 to 1 mm size range while they are in the bouncing regime,\nand study the formation of clusters through sticking collisions between\nparticles. We developed statistical methods for the analysis of the large\nquantity of collision data collected by the experiment. We measured the average\nmotion of particles, the moment of clustering, and the cluster size formed. In\naddition, we ran simple numerical simulations in order to validate our\nmeasurements. We computed the average coefficient of restitution (COR) of\ncollisions and find values ranging from 0.55 for systems including a population\nof fine grains to 0.94 for systems of denser particles.

Our findings have the following implications that can be useful for the\nsimulation of particles in PPDs and planetary rings: (1) The average COR of\ncollisions between same-sized free-floating particles at low speeds (< 2 cm/s)\nis not dependent on the collision velocity; (2) The simplified approach of\nusing a constant COR value will accurately reproduce the average behavior of a\nparticle system during collisional cooling; (3) At speeds below 5 mm/s, the\ninfluence of particle rotation becomes apparent on the collision behavior; (4)\nCurrent dust collision models predicting sticking thresholds are robust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 19:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

Local properties are properties characterized by the\nexclusion of small sets of codewords, and include list-decodability,\nlist-recoverability and average-radius list-decodability.\n  In order to prove our results on LDPC codes, we establish sharp thresholds\nfor when local properties are satisfied by a random linear code. More\nprecisely, we show that for any local property $\\mathcal{P}$, there is some\n$R^*$ so that random linear codes of rate slightly less than $R^*$ satisfy\n$\\mathcal{P}$ with high probability, while random linear codes of rate slightly\nmore than $R^*$, with high probability, do not. We also give a characterization\nof the threshold rate $R^*$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 20:17:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 18:40:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 08:36:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 15:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-18"}

In recent years, the study of paths in\ntemporal graphs, that is, graphs where the vertex set is fixed but the edge set\nchanges over time, gained more and more attention. A path is time-respecting,\nor temporal, if it uses edges with non-decreasing time stamps. We investigate a\nbasic constraint for temporal paths, where the time spent at each vertex must\nnot exceed a given duration $\\Delta$, referred to as $\\Delta$-restless temporal\npaths. This constraint arises naturally in the modeling of real-world processes\nlike packet routing in communication networks and infection transmission routes\nof diseases where recovery confers lasting resistance. While finding temporal\npaths without waiting time restrictions is known to be doable in polynomial\ntime, we show that the \"restless variant\" of this problem becomes\ncomputationally hard even in very restrictive settings. For example, it is\nW[1]-hard when parameterized by the distance to disjoint path of the underlying\ngraph, which implies W[1]-hardness for many other parameters like feedback\nvertex number and pathwidth. A natural question is thus whether the problem\nbecomes tractable in some natural settings. We explore several natural\nparameterizations, presenting FPT algorithms for three kinds of parameters: (1)\noutput-related parameters (here, the maximum length of the path), (2) classical\nparameters applied to the underlying graph (e.g., feedback edge number), and\n(3) a new parameter called timed feedback vertex number, which captures\nfiner-grained temporal features of the input temporal graph, and which may be\nof interest beyond this work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 20:39:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 09:43:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 15:47:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 07:33:05 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 08:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

Our simulation study shows that the\nimplementation of a meta-heuristic method like the genetic algorithm results in\na significantly faster and accurate search method when compared to the\nbrute-force parameter sweep method in both single and multi-layer optimization.\nWhile other sweep methods can also outperform the brute-force method, they do\nnot consistently exhibit $100\\%$ accuracy in the optimized results like our\ngenetic algorithm. We have used a well-studied P3HT-based structure to test our\nalgorithm. Our best-case scenario was observed to use $60.84\\%$ fewer\nsimulations than the brute-force method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 2019 11:46:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 14:19:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 07:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}

While previous articles have the same form and dependencies, the\nproportionality constants often differ in the literature. This paper resolves\nthese discrepancies. The rate at which energy is delivered to an optically\ntrapped particle's respective degrees of freedom depends on the radiation\npattern of scattered light as well as the direction of laser propagation. For a\ntraveling plane wave with linearly polarized light, in the Rayleigh regime this\nleads the translational shot noise heating rate to be proportional to $1/10$ of\nthe total rate in the laser polarization direction, $7/10$ in the laser\npropagation direction, and $2/10$ in the direction perpendicular to both.\nAnalytical expressions for the shot noise heating rate are provided in the\nRayleigh limit as well as numerical calculations for particles in the Mie\nregime for silica and diamond. For completeness, numerical calculations of the\nshot noise heating for silica Mie particles at the focus of a strongly focused\nlaser beam are calculated for varying numerical aperture and common laser\nwavelengths. Both numerical calculations show that the Rayleigh expression\ngenerally gives an overestimate of the shot noise heating especially for larger\nradii, but is still a good approximation even for incident focal fields. The\nexception to the relative decrease is when a Mie resonance is reached which was\nfound for diamond. Lastly, Rayleigh expressions for the rotational shot noise\nheating for a symmetric top-like particle for linear, elliptically, and\nunpolarized light are also provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 22:11:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 19:43:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 17:14:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

We consider two versions of the\nproblem: fixed projections and variable projections. MPSE with fixed\nprojections takes as input a set of pairwise distance matrices defined on the\ndata points, along with the same number of projections and embeds the points in\n3D so that the pairwise distances are preserved in the given projections. MPSE\nwith variable projections takes as input a set of pairwise distance matrices\nand embeds the points in 3D while also computing the appropriate projections\nthat preserve the pairwise distances. The proposed approach can be useful in\nmultiple scenarios: from creating simultaneous embedding of multiple graphs on\nthe same set of vertices, to reconstructing a 3D object from multiple 2D\nsnapshots, to analyzing data from multiple points of view. We provide a\nfunctional prototype of MPSE that is based on an adaptive and stochastic\ngeneralization of multi-dimensional scaling to multiple distances and multiple\nvariable projections.

This paper provides a novel learning-based approach towards\nsuch wireless network design. To that end, a parametric model of a practical\nenergy harvester, accounting for various sources of nonlinearities, is proposed\nusing a nonlinear regression algorithm applied over collected real data.\nRelying on the proposed model, the learning problem of modulation design for\nSimultaneous Wireless Information-Power Transmission (SWIPT) over a\npoint-to-point link is studied. Joint optimization of the transmitter and the\nreceiver is implemented using Neural Network (NN)-based autoencoders.

Extension of the studied problem to learning\nmodulation design for multi-user SWIPT scenarios and coded modulation design\nfor point-to-point SWIPT are considered. The major conclusion of this work is\nto utilize learning-based results to design non learning-based algorithms,\nwhich perform as well.

PoP utilizes PUFs which are responsible\nfor generating a unique key that cannot be cloned and hence provide the highest\nlevel of security. A PUF uses the nanoelectronic manufacturing variations that\nare introduced during the fabrication of an integrated circuit to generate the\nkeys. Hence, once generated from a PUF module, the keys cannot be cloned or\ngenerated from any other module. PUFchain uses a PUF and Hashing module which\nperforms the necessary cryptographic functions. Hence the mining process is\noffloaded to the hardware module which reduces the processing times.

The proposed targeted attack, termed Constrained\nIterative Attack for Skeleton Actions (CIASA), perturbs joint locations in an\naction sequence such that the resulting adversarial sequence preserves the\ntemporal coherence, spatial integrity, and the anthropomorphic plausibility of\nthe skeletons. CIASA achieves this feat by satisfying multiple physical\nconstraints, and employing spatial skeleton realignments for the perturbed\nskeletons along with regularization of the adversarial skeletons with\nGenerative networks.

The study of higher-order interactions, via a hypergraph network,\nbrings in new insights. We study community detection in a hypergraph network. A\npopular approach is to project the hypergraph to a graph and then apply\ncommunity detection methods for graph networks, but we show that this approach\nmay cause unwanted information loss. We propose a new method for community\ndetection that operates directly on the hypergraph. At the heart of our method\nis a regularized higher-order orthogonal iteration (reg-HOOI) algorithm that\ncomputes an approximate low-rank decomposition of the network adjacency tensor.\nCompared with existing tensor decomposition methods such as HOSVD and vanilla\nHOOI, reg-HOOI yields better performance, especially when the hypergraph is\nsparse. Given the output of tensor decomposition, we then generalize the\ncommunity detection method SCORE (Jin, 2015) from graph networks to hypergraph\nnetworks. We call our new method Tensor-SCORE.\n  In theory, we introduce a degree-corrected block model for hypergraphs\n(hDCBM), and show that Tensor-SCORE yields consistent community detection for a\nwide range of network sparsity and degree heterogeneity. As a byproduct, we\nderive the rates of convergence on estimating the principal subspace by\nreg-HOOI, with different initializations, including the two new initialization\nmethods we propose, a diagonal-removed HOSVD and a randomized graph projection.\n  We apply our method to several real hypergraph networks which yields\nencouraging results.

This study is followed by the development of a virtual agent\nhead which is mounted to the top of the chassis of the BWIBot mobile robot\nplatform. Contrasting the performance of the virtual agent head against an LED\nturn signal demonstrates that the naturalistic, implicit gaze cue is more\neasily interpreted than the LED turn signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 2019 08:45:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 09:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-07"}

Our\naim is to understand how to relate photometric variability to physical\nparameters in order to help the interpretation of these observations.

We analyzed these time series to study the\neffect of the star spectral type on brightness variability, the relationship\nbetween brightness variability and LogR'HK, the interpretation of brightness\nvariability as a function of spot and plage properties, and the spot-dominated\nor plage-dominated regimes. Within our range of activity levels, the brightness\nvariability increases toward low-mass stars, as suggested by Kepler results.\nBrightness variability roughly correlates to LogR'HK level, but with a large\ndispersion, caused by spot contrast and inclination. It is also directly\nrelated to the number of structures, and we show that it cannot be interpreted\nsolely in terms of spot sizes. In the activity range of old main-sequence\nstars, we can obtain both spot or plage dominated regimes, as in observation.\nThe same star can be observed in both regimes depending on inclination. Only\nstrong correlations between LogR'HK and brightness variability are significant.\nOur realistic time series proves to be extremely useful when interpreting\nobservations and understanding their limitations, most notably in terms of\nactivity interpretation.

However, this is rarely\nthe case in real LR images, in contrast to synthetically generated SR datasets.\nWhen the assumed downscaling kernel deviates from the true one, the performance\nof SR methods significantly deteriorates. This gave rise to Blind-SR - namely,\nSR when the downscaling kernel (\"SR-kernel\") is unknown. It was further shown\nthat the true SR-kernel is the one that maximizes the recurrence of patches\nacross scales of the LR image. In this paper we show how this powerful\ncross-scale recurrence property can be realized using Deep Internal Learning.\nWe introduce \"KernelGAN\", an image-specific Internal-GAN, which trains solely\non the LR test image at test time, and learns its internal distribution of\npatches. Its Generator is trained to produce a downscaled version of the LR\ntest image, such that its Discriminator cannot distinguish between the patch\ndistribution of the downscaled image, and the patch distribution of the\noriginal LR image. The Generator, once trained, constitutes the downscaling\noperation with the correct image-specific SR-kernel. KernelGAN is fully\nunsupervised, requires no training data other than the input image itself, and\nleads to state-of-the-art results in Blind-SR when plugged into existing SR\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 2019 11:29:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 07:11:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 15:48:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 13:03:46 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 4 Jan 2020 08:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2020 06:54:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Despite the reputation\nof learned NN models as black boxes, and the theoretical hardness of proving\nuseful properties about them, researchers have been successful in verifying\nsome classes of models by exploiting their piecewise linear structure and\ntaking insights from formal methods such as Satisifiability Modulo Theory.\nHowever, these methods are still far from scaling to realistic neural networks.\nTo facilitate progress on this crucial area, we exploit the Mixed Integer\nLinear Programming (MIP) formulation of verification to propose a family of\nalgorithms based on Branch-and-Bound (BaB).

Such devices operate only\nintermittently, as energy is available, presenting a number of challenges for\nsoftware developers. Programmers face a complex design space requiring\nreasoning about energy, memory consistency, and forward progress. This paper\nintroduces Alpaca, a low-overhead programming model for intermittent computing\non energy-harvesting devices. Alpaca programs are composed of a sequence of\nuser-defined tasks. The Alpaca runtime preserves execution progress at the\ngranularity of a task. The key insight in Alpaca is the privatization of data\nshared between tasks. Updates of shared values in a task are privatized and\nonly committed to main memory on successful execution of the task, ensuring\nthat data remain consistent despite power failures. Alpaca provides a familiar\nprogramming interface and a highly efficient runtime model.

Because of the diversity of the sub-tasks,\nthe layers within and across the DNN models are highly heterogeneous in\noperation and shape. Such layer heterogeneity is a challenge for a fixed\ndataflow accelerator (FDA) that employs a fixed dataflow on a single\naccelerator substrate since each layer prefers different dataflows (computation\norder and parallelization) and tile sizes. Reconfigurable DNN accelerators\n(RDAs) have been proposed to adapt their dataflows to diverse layers to address\nthe challenge. However, the dataflow flexibility in RDAs is enabled at the area\nand energy costs of expensive hardware structures (switches, controller, etc.)\nand per-layer reconfiguration.\n  Alternatively, this work proposes a new class of accelerators, heterogeneous\ndataflow accelerators (HDAs), which deploys multiple sub-accelerators each\nsupporting a different dataflow. HDAs enable coarser-grained dataflow\nflexibility than RDAs with higher energy efficiency and lower area cost\ncomparable to FDAs. To exploit such benefits, hardware resource partitioning\nacross sub-accelerators and layer execution schedule need to be carefully\noptimized. Therefore, we also present Herald, which co-optimizes hardware\npartitioning and layer execution schedule. Using Herald on a suite of AR/VR and\nMLPerf workloads, we identify a promising HDA architecture, Maelstrom, which\ndemonstrates 65.3% lower latency and 5.0% lower energy than the best FDAs and\n22.0% lower energy at the cost of 20.7% higher latency than a state-of-the-art\nRDA.

We implement our model on an assistive healthcare robot, named Robot\nNurse Assistant (RNA) and test it with human subjects. Our model records all\nthe emotion states and essential information based on its predefined rules and\nlearning system. Our results show that our robot interacts with patients in a\nreasonable, faithful way in special conditions which are defined by rules. This\nwork has the potential to provide better on-demand service for clinical experts\nto monitor the patients' emotion states and help them make better decisions\naccordingly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 2019 07:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Based on the theory of Game-With-A-Purpose (GWAP), this paper\ncontributes to a novel large-scale crowdsourcing disaster monitoring system.\nThe system analyzes tagged satellite pictures from anonymous players, and then\nreports aggregated and evaluated monitoring results to its stakeholders. An\nalgorithm based on directed graph centralities is presented to address the core\nissues of malicious user detection and disaster level calculation. Our method\ncan be easily applied in other human computation systems. In the end, some\nissues with possible solutions are discussed for our future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 2019 14:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-04"}
