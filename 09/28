In the query-commit\nmodel, an edge e independently exists with probability $p_e$. We can query\nwhether an edge exists or not, but if it does exist, then we have to take it\ninto our solution. In the unweighted case, one can query edges in the order\ngiven by the classical online algorithm of Karp, Vazirani, and Vazirani to get\na $(1-1/e)$-approximation. In contrast, the previously best known algorithm in\nthe weighted case is the $(1/2)$-approximation achieved by the greedy algorithm\nthat sorts the edges according to their weights and queries in that order.\n  Improving upon the basic greedy, we give a $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm\nin the weighted query-commit model. We use a linear program (LP) to upper bound\nthe optimum achieved by any strategy. The proposed LP admits several structural\nproperties that play a crucial role in the design and analysis of our\nalgorithm.

Micropolarizer-based sensors are dramatically smaller and more\nmechanically robust than other polarimeters with similar spectral response and\nsnapshot capability. To determine the suitability of these new polarimeters for\nastronomical applications, we developed the RIT Polarization Imaging Camera to\ninvestigate the performance of these devices, with a special attention to the\nlow signal-to-noise regime. We characterized the device performance in the lab,\nby determining the relative throughput, efficiency, and orientation of every\npixel, as a function of wavelength. Using the resulting pixel response model,\nwe developed demodulation procedures for aperture photometry and imaging\npolarimetry observing modes. We found that, using the current calibration,\nRITPIC is capable of detecting polarization signals as small as <0.3%. To\ndemonstrate the stability of RITPIC's calibration and its extreme portability,\nwe performed imaging polarimetry of the Solar corona in Madras, Oregon during\nthe total Solar eclipse of 2017. The maximum polarization we measured was ~46%,\nwhich agrees well with the maximum value predicted for a Thomson scattering\ncorona. Similarly, we found no strong deviations in the angle of linear\npolarization from the tangential direction. The relative ease of data\ncollection, calibration, and analysis provided by these sensors suggest than\nthey may become an important tool for a number of astronomical targets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 16:38:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

Many previous works have aimed at finding accurate stock market\nforecasting models. In this paper, we use text mining and sentiment analysis on\nChinese online financial news, to predict Chinese stock tendency and stock\nprices based on support vector machine (SVM). Firstly, we collect 2,302,692\nnews items, which date from 1/1/2008 to 1/1/2015. Secondly, based on this\ndataset, a specific domain stop-word dictionary and a precise sentiment\ndictionary are formed. Thirdly, we propose a forecasting model using SVM. On\nthe algorithm of SVM implementation, we also propose two-parameter optimization\nalgorithms to search for the best initial parameter setting. The result shows\nthat parameter G has the main effect, while parameter C's effect is not\nobvious. Furthermore, support vector regression (SVR) models for different\nChinese stocks are similar whereas in support vector classification (SVC)\nmodels best parameters are quite differential. Series of contrast experiments\nshow that: a) News has significant influence on stock market; b) Expansion\ninput vector for additional situations when that day has no news data is better\nthan normal input in SVR, yet is worse in SVC; c) SVR shows a fantastic degree\nof fitting in predicting stock fluctuation while such result has some time lag;\nd) News effect time lag for stock market is less than two days; e) In SVC,\nhistoric stock data has a most efficient time lag which is about 10 days,\nwhereas in SVR this effect is not obvious. Besides, based on the special\nstructure of the input vector, we also design a method to calculate the\nfinancial source impact factor. Result suggests that the news quality and\naudience number both have a significant effect on the source impact factor.\nBesides, for Chinese investors, traditional media has more influence than\ndigital media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 16:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-30"}

While\nmost of the existing work has diagnosed main causes of imprecision in static\nanalysis by manual investigation, manually tracing the imprecision causes is\nchallenging because it requires detailed knowledge of analyzer internals.\nRecently, several studies proposed to localize the analysis imprecision causes\nautomatically, but these localization techniques work for only specific\nanalysis techniques.\n  In this paper, we present an automatic technique that can trace analysis\nimprecision causes of JavaScript applications starting from user-selected\nvariables. Given a set of program variables, our technique stops an analysis\nwhen any of the variables gets imprecise analysis values. It then traces the\nimprecise analysis values using intermediate analysis results back to program\npoints where the imprecision first started. Our technique shows the trace\ninformation with a new representation called tracing graphs, whose nodes and\nedges together represent traces from imprecise points to precise points. In\norder to detect major causes of analysis imprecision automatically, we present\nfour node/edge patterns in tracing graphs for common imprecision causes. We\nformalized the technique of generating tracing graphs and identifying patterns,\nand implemented them on SAFE, a state-of-the-art JavaScript static analyzer\nwith various analysis configurations, such as context-sensitivity,\nloop-sensitivity, and heap cloning. Our evaluation demonstrates that the\ntechnique can easily find 96 % of the major causes of the imprecision problems\nin 17 applications by only automatic detection in tracing graphs using the\npatterns, and selectively adopting various advanced techniques can eliminate\nthe found causes of imprecision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 17:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-30"}

Optimization-based methods fit a parametric body model to\n2D observations in an iterative manner, leading to accurate image-model\nalignments, but are often slow and sensitive to the initialization. In\ncontrast, regression-based methods, that use a deep network to directly\nestimate the model parameters from pixels, tend to provide reasonable, but not\npixel accurate, results while requiring huge amounts of supervision. In this\nwork, instead of investigating which approach is better, our key insight is\nthat the two paradigms can form a strong collaboration. A reasonable, directly\nregressed estimate from the network can initialize the iterative optimization\nmaking the fitting faster and more accurate. Similarly, a pixel accurate fit\nfrom iterative optimization can act as strong supervision for the network. This\nis the core of our proposed approach SPIN (SMPL oPtimization IN the loop). The\ndeep network initializes an iterative optimization routine that fits the body\nmodel to 2D joints within the training loop, and the fitted estimate is\nsubsequently used to supervise the network. Our approach is self-improving by\nnature, since better network estimates can lead the optimization to better\nsolutions, while more accurate optimization fits provide better supervision for\nthe network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in different\nsettings, where 3D ground truth is scarce, or not available, and we\nconsistently outperform the state-of-the-art model-based pose estimation\napproaches by significant margins.

Working at the level of segments\noffers increased invariance to view-point and local structural changes, and\nfacilitates real-time processing of large-scale 3D data. SegMap exploits a\nsingle compact data-driven descriptor for performing multiple tasks: global\nlocalization, 3D dense map reconstruction, and semantic information extraction.\nThe performance of SegMap is evaluated in multiple urban driving and search and\nrescue experiments.

In consequence, we achieve a higher localization accuracy and a 6%\nincrease in recall over state-of-the-art.

It is straightforward to produce a reduced density\nmatrix with the partial-trace map by ``tracing out'' part of the quantum state,\nbut in many natural situations this reduction may not be achievable. We\ninvestigate the general problem of identifying how the quantum state reduces\ngiven a restriction on the observables. For example, in an experimental\nsetting, the set of observables that can actually be measured is usually modest\n(compared to the set of all possible observables) and their resolution is\nlimited. In such situations, the appropriate state-reduction map can be defined\nvia a generalized bipartition, which is associated with the structure of\nirreducible representations of the algebra generated by the restricted set of\nobservables. One of our main technical results is a general, not inherently\nnumeric, algorithm for finding irreducible representations of matrix algebras.\nWe demonstrate the viability of this approach with two examples of\nlimited--resolution observables. The definition of quantum state reductions can\nalso be extended beyond algebras of observables. To accomplish this task we\nintroduce a more flexible notion of bipartition, the partial bipartition, which\ndescribes coarse-grainings preserving information about a limited set (not\nnecessarily algebra) of observables. We describe a variational method to choose\nthe coarse-grainings most compatible with a specified Hamiltonian, which\nexhibit emergent classicality in the reduced state space.

One such avenue is\nbased on the fact that magnetic fields cause deformations of a neutron star,\nwhich results in a magnetic-field-induced quadrupole ellipticity. If the\nmagnetic and rotation axes are different, this quadrupole ellipticity may\ngenerate continuous gravitational waves which may last decades, and may be\nobservable in current or future detectors. Light, milli-magnetic monopoles, if\nthey exist, could be pair-produced non-perturbatively in the extreme magnetic\nfields of neutron stars, such as magnetars.

First, we propose a stochastic model taking into\naccount a positive surface for streets and crossroads, thus allowing for a more\nrealistic estimation of the minimal number of needed relays. Secondly, we\nintroduce a cost model for the deployment of relays, allowing one to study\noperators' D2D deployment strategies. We investigate the example of an\nuberizing neo-operator willing to set up a network entirely relying on D2D and\nshow that a return on the initial investment in relays is possible in a\nrealistic period of time, even if the network is funded by a very low revenue\nper D2D user.

In such a case, the security of\nDSM cyberinfrastructure will be critical as advanced metering infrastructure,\nand communication systems are susceptible to hacking, cyber-attacks. Such\nattacks, in the form of data injection, can manipulate customer load profiles\nand cause metering chaos and energy losses in the grid.

By replacing these traditionally static\nparameters with dynamically predicted values, we vastly increase the accuracy\nof the extended H\\\"uckel model.

When phase errors from high altitude\nturbulence scintillate due to Fresnel propagation, wavefront amplitude errors\nmay be spatially offset from residual phase errors. These correlated errors\nappear as asymmetry in the image plane under the Fraunhofer condition. In an\nanalytic model with an open-loop AO system, the strength of the asymmetry is\ncalculated for a single mode of phase aberration, which generalizes to two\ndimensions under a Fourier decomposition of the complex illumination. Other\nparameters included are the spatial offset of the AO correction, which is the\nwind velocity in the frozen flow regime multiplied by the effective AO time\ndelay, and propagation distance or altitude of the turbulent layer. In this\nmodel, the asymmetry is strongest when the wind is slow and nearest to the\ncoronagraphic mask when the turbulent layer is far away, such as when the\ntelescope is pointing low towards the horizon. A great emphasis is made about\nthe fact that the brighter asymmetric lobe of the PSF points in the opposite\ndirection as the wind, which is consistent analytically with the clarification\nthat the image plane electric field distribution is actually the inverse\nFourier transform of the aperture plane. Validation of this understanding is\nmade with observations taken from the Gemini Planet Imager, as well as being\nreproducible in end-to-end AO simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 23:06:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

The latter solutions have been reported recently both\nanalytically and numerically. The superregular clouds cannot be obtained from\nthe regular clouds around subextremal Kerr BH's ($|a|< M$) in the limit of\nextremality $(a\\rightarrow M)$ as in this limit the radial derivatives of\n$\\Psi$ at the horizon $r_H$ diverge when $r_H\\rightarrow r_H^{\\rm ext}:=M=a$,\nthus, such superregular clouds must be analyzed separately. We conclude that\nthe superregular clouds, which are found in the {\\it exact} extremal scenario\n($a = M$), are not continuously connected with the regular ones in the limit of\nextremality $(a\\rightarrow M)$. Remarkably, the spectrum leading to the\nexistence of the radial part of the full solution of these superregular clouds\n(which obeys a Teukolsky equation) is given by the exact formula\n$M=a=\\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\sqrt{m^2 + \\left[-\\kappa+\\sqrt{\\kappa^2+m^2}\\,\\right]^2}$,\nwhich depends on three (positive) integers: the principal number $n$, the {\\it\nmagnetic number} $m$, and an integer $j$, related with the {\\it type} of\nregularity at the horizon. Here $\\kappa= j +n$, and $\\mu$ is the mass\nassociated with $\\Psi$. This spectrum depends implicitly on the {\\it orbital}\nnumber $l$, an integer number that determines the existence of well behaved\nspheroidal harmonics which are associated with the angular part of the cloud\nsolution. Since the separation constants that are obtained from the\nsuperregularity conditions in the radial part of the solution do {\\it not}\ncoincide in general with the standard separation constants required for the\nspheroidal harmonics to be well behaved on the axis of symmetry, we conclude\nthat non-trivial boson clouds having such superregularity conditions cannot\nexist in the background of an exact extremal Kerr BH. The only exception to\nthis conclusion is in the limit $n\\rightarrow \\infty$ and $m\\ll n$. In such a\nlarge $n$ limit consistency in the separation constants leads to a quadratic\nDiophantine equation of Pell's type for the integer numbers $(l,m)$. Such\nPell's equation can be readily solved using standard techniques. In that\ninstance well behaved spheroidal harmonics are obtained, and thus, well behaved\nnon-trivial superregular clouds can be computed. Of course, this situation,\ndoes not preclude the existence of other kind of smooth cloud solutions for any\nother $n$, not necessarily large (e.g. clouds with a non-integer $\\kappa$) when\nusing a better behaved coordinate system at the horizon (e.g. Wheeler's\ntortoise coordinate or proper radial distance).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 23:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

This\nhas posed a number of challenges especially when analyzing high-dimensional\ndata sets in which the number of predictors $\\mathit{p}$ is much larger than\nnumber of samples $n,~(n\\ll p)$. A new covariance estimator, called the\n\\textit{Maximum Entropy Covariance} (MEC) that addresses loss of covariance\ninformation when similar covariance matrices are linearly combined using\n\\textit{Maximum Entropy} (ME) principle is proposed in this work. By\nbenefitting naturally from slicing or discretizing range of the response\nvariable, y into \\textit{H} non-overlapping categories, $\\mathit{h_{1},\\ldots\n,h_{H}}$, MEC first combines covariance matrices arising from samples in each y\nslice $\\mathit{h\\in H}$ and then select the one that maximizes entropy under\nthe principle of maximum uncertainty.

MEC deals directly with singularity and instability of\nsample group covariance estimate in both regression and classification\nproblems. The efficiency of the MEC estimator is studied with the existing\nsufficient dimension reduction methods such as \\textit{Sliced Inverse\nRegression} (SIR) and \\textit{Sliced Average Variance Estimator} (SAVE) as\ndemonstrated on both classification and regression problems using real life\nLeukemia cancer data and customers' electricity load profiles from smart meter\ndata sets respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Sep 2019 03:34:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

We do not have direct experience of information available at the\nlevel of individual neurons, which is noisy and highly stochastic.

The observables such\nas the radius of the shadow, image separation and magnification of the\ncorresponding Wheelerian masses are compared with those of a black hole\n(idealized SgrA* chosen for illustration) assuming that the three types of\nlenses share the same minimum impact parameter and distance from the observer.\nIt turns out that, while the massless EMS\\ wormholes can closely mimic the\nblack hole in terms of strong field lensing observables, the EMD wormholes show\nconsiderable differences due to the presence of dilatonic charge. The\nconclusion is that masslessless alone is enough to closely mimic Schwarzschild\nblack hole strong lensing observables in the EMS theory but not in the other,\nwhere extra parameters also influence those observables. The motion of timelike\nparticles is briefly discussed for completeness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Sep 2019 09:20:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

In\nparallel, numerical simulations have demonstrated that radially-biased pressure\nanisotropy slowly builds up in realistic models of globular clusters from\ninitial isotropic conditions, leading to anisotropy profiles that, to some\nextent, mimic those resulting from incomplete violent relaxation known to be\nrelevant to elliptical galaxies. In this paper we consider a set of realistic\nsimulations realized by means of Monte Carlo methods and analyze them by means\nof self-consistent two-component models. For the purpose, we refer to an\nunderlying distribution function, originally conceived to describe elliptical\ngalaxies, that has been recently truncated and adapted to the context of\nglobular clusters. The two components are meant to represent light stars\n(combining all main sequence stars) and heavy stars (giants, dark remnants, and\nbinaries). We show that this conceptually simple family of two-component\ntruncated models provides a reasonable description of simulated density,\nvelocity dispersion, and anisotropy profiles, especially for the most relaxed\nsystems, with the capability to express quantitatively the attained levels of\nenergy equipartition and mass segregation. In contrast, two-component isotropic\nmodels based on the King distribution function do not offer a comparably\nsatisfactory representation of the simulated globular clusters.

We aim\nto characterize and correct the instrumental polarization effects of the\ncomplete optical system, i.e. the telescope and SPHERE/IRDIS. Methods. We\ncreate a detailed Mueller matrix model in the broadband filters Y-, J-, H- and\nKs, and calibrate it using measurements with SPHERE's internal light source and\nobservations of two unpolarized stars. We develop a data-reduction method that\nuses the model to correct for the instrumental polarization effects, and apply\nit to observations of the circumstellar disk of T Cha. Results. The\ninstrumental polarization is almost exclusively produced by the telescope and\nSPHERE's first mirror and varies with telescope altitude angle. The crosstalk\nprimarily originates from the image derotator (K-mirror). At some orientations,\nthe derotator causes severe loss of signal (>90% loss in H- and Ks-band) and\nstrongly offsets the angle of linear polarization. With our correction method\nwe reach in all filters a total polarimetric accuracy of <0.1% in the degree of\nlinear polarization and an accuracy of a few degrees in angle of linear\npolarization. Conclusions. The correction method enables us to accurately\nmeasure the polarized intensity and angle of linear polarization of\ncircumstellar disks, and is a vital tool for detecting unresolved (inner) disks\nand measuring the polarization of substellar companions.

By introspection, mathematicians usually have some beliefs regarding\nthese questions. But these beliefs are usually in a big contrast with the\nrecent cognitive theoretic findings concerning mathematics. Contemporary\ncognitive science opens new approaches to reformulate the fundamental questions\nconcerning mathematics and helps mathematicians break through the Platonic\nbeliefs about the essence and sources of mathematical knowledge. In this\narticle, we introduce and discuss mathematical thinking activities and\nfundamental processes such as symbolic/formal and visual/spatial ones. Two\ndifferent aspects of mathematics should be separated in mathematical cognition.\nOne aspect considers mathematics as an explicit crystallized knowledge. The\nother aspect considers mathematics as an ongoing and transient mental\nprocessing. The cognitive processes and corresponding tasks involved in these\naspects are different. Ongoing mathematical activities both elementary and\nadvanced, demand working memory resources. Using dual-task techniques, we\ndesign some pilot experiments to differentiate the symbolic/formal and\nvisual/spatial processes. Using this memory theoretic approach, we explain the\ncrucial roles of language-based processes such as verbal articulation and\ninstructive speech and also visuo-spatial intuition such as spatial imagery and\nmental movement in various aspects of mathematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Sep 2019 09:02:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

Our approach can improve a 3D object detection performance by\npredicting more precise 3D bounding box coordinates. The proposed approach\nrequires 40 minutes of training to improve the detection performance. Moreover,\nepBRM imposes less than 12ms to network inference time for up-to 20 objects.\n  The proposed approach utilizes a spatial transformation mechanism to simplify\nthe box regression task. Adopting spatial transformation mechanism into epBRM\nmakes it possible to improve the quality of detection with a small sized\nnetwork.\n  We conduct in-depth analysis of the effect of various spatial transformation\nmechanisms applied on raw LiDAR 3D point clouds.

We propose\nthree simple and scalable methods to analyze the variance of outputs from a\ntrained network under tolerable perturbations: infer-transformation,\ninfer-noise, and infer-dropout.

The considered scenario involves the interaction of\na strong optical laser with a solid-state nuclear target leading to the\ngeneration of a plasma. In addition, intense x-ray radiation from an X-ray Free\nElectron Laser (XFEL) produces inner-shell holes in the plasma ions, into which\nNEEC may occur. As case study we consider the $4.85$-keV transition starting\nfrom the 2.4 MeV long-lived $^{\\mathrm{93m}}$Mo isomer that can be used to\nrelease the energy stored in this metastable nuclear state. We find that the\nrecombination into $2p_{1/2}$ inner-shell holes is most efficient in driving\nthe nuclear transition. Already at few hundred eV plasma temperature, the\ngeneration of inner-shell holes can allow optimal conditions for NEEC,\notherwise reached for steady-state plasma conditions in thermodynamical\nequilibrium only at few keV. The combination of x-ray and optical lasers\npresents two advantages: first, NEEC rates can be maximized at plasma\ntemperatures where the photoexcitation rate remains low. Second, with mJ-class\noptical lasers and an XFEL repetition rate of $10$ kHz, the NEEC excitation\nnumber can reach $\\sim 1$ depleted isomer per second and is competitive with\nscenarios recently envisaged at petawatt-class lasers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 16:36:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 09:10:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

Yet the way decisions are made on who is eligible\nfor jobs, and why, are rapidly changing with the advent and growth in uptake of\nautomated hiring systems (AHSs) powered by data-driven tools. Key concerns\nabout such AHSs include the lack of transparency and potential limitation of\naccess to jobs for specific profiles. In relation to the latter, however,\nseveral of these AHSs claim to detect and mitigate discriminatory practices\nagainst protected groups and promote diversity and inclusion at work. Yet\nwhilst these tools have a growing user-base around the world, such claims of\nbias mitigation are rarely scrutinised and evaluated, and when done so, have\nalmost exclusively been from a US socio-legal perspective. In this paper, we\nintroduce a perspective outside the US by critically examining how three\nprominent automated hiring systems (AHSs) in regular use in the UK, HireVue,\nPymetrics and Applied, understand and attempt to mitigate bias and\ndiscrimination. Using publicly available documents, we describe how their tools\nare designed, validated and audited for bias, highlighting assumptions and\nlimitations, before situating these in the socio-legal context of the UK. The\nUK has a very different legal background to the US in terms not only of hiring\nand equality law, but also in terms of data protection (DP) law. We argue that\nthis might be important for addressing concerns about transparency and could\nmean a challenge to building bias mitigation into AHSs definitively capable of\nmeeting EU legal standards. This is significant as these AHSs, especially those\ndeveloped in the US, may obscure rather than improve systemic discrimination in\nthe workplace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Sep 2019 10:56:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 11:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-20"}
