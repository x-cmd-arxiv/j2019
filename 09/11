The mechanism behind this property and its dependence on the\nvarious anions and cations in the LHP material composition are still an active\ntopic of debate. Here, we apply ultrabroadband terahertz spectroscopy with a\ntime resolution < 200 fs to probe the early carrier mobility dynamics of\nphotoexcited perovskite samples of different chemical compositions. An increase\nin the carrier mobility with time constants in the range of 0.3 to 0.7 ps is\nobserved for different LHPs, in which the signal amplitude is larger at shorter\nexcitation wavelengths. This feature is assigned to the relaxation of hot\ncarriers from low-curvature regions of the band structure to the bottom of the\nvalley, where their effective mass accounts for the maximum mobility. The\ndependence of the mobility dynamics on the initial photogenerated carrier\npopulation shows that carrier cooling competes with a dynamic screening effect\nassociated with polaron formation and relaxation. A kinetic model that\nconsiders all competing processes is proposed. Simulations based on this model\nallow us to fit the experimental data well and evidence a composition\ndependence of the dynamic screening lifetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 16:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

Recent deep learning\nmodels have been proposed to predict the depth from the image by learning the\nalignment of deep features between the RGB image and the depth domains. In this\npaper, we present a novel approach, named Structure-Attentioned Memory Network,\nto more effectively transfer domain features for monocular depth estimation by\ntaking into account the common structure regularities (e.g., repetitive\nstructure patterns, planar surfaces, symmetries) in domain adaptation. To this\nend, we introduce a new Structure-Oriented Memory (SOM) module to learn and\nmemorize the structure-specific information between RGB image domain and the\ndepth domain. More specifically, in the SOM module, we develop a Memorable Bank\nof Filters (MBF) unit to learn a set of filters that memorize the\nstructure-aware image-depth residual pattern, and also an Attention Guided\nController (AGC) unit to control the filter selection in the MBF given image\nfeatures queries. Given the query image feature, the trained SOM module is able\nto adaptively select the best customized filters for cross-domain feature\ntransferring with an optimal structural disparity between image and depth. In\nsummary, we focus on addressing this structure-specific domain adaption\nchallenge by proposing a novel end-to-end multi-scale memorable network for\nmonocular depth estimation.

Then, in order to reduce the computational complexity, we\nderive another concave lower bound function of each group's rate for each set\nof variables at every iteration, and obtain the closed-form solutions under\nthese loose surrogate objective functions. Finally, the simulation results\ndemonstrate the benefits in terms of the spectral and energy efficiency of the\nintroduced IRS and the effectiveness in terms of the convergence and complexity\nof our proposed algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 16:30:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Sep 2019 11:48:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 20:55:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 13:37:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

In general, existing retrieval methods can be regarded as\nvisual-based retrieval approaches which search and return a set of similar\nimages from a database to a given query image. Although retrieval methods have\nachieved great success, there is still a question that needs to be responded\nto: Can we obtain the accurate semantic labels of the returned similar images\nto further help analyzing and processing imagery? Inspired by the above\nquestion, in this paper, we redefine the image retrieval problem as visual and\nsemantic retrieval of images. Specifically, we propose a novel deep hashing\nconvolutional neural network (DHCNN) to simultaneously retrieve the similar\nimages and classify their semantic labels in a unified framework. In more\ndetail, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract\nhigh-dimensional deep features. Then, a hash layer is perfectly inserted into\nthe network to transfer the deep features into compact hash codes. In addition,\na fully connected layer with a softmax function is performed on hash layer to\ngenerate class distribution. Finally, a loss function is elaborately designed\nto simultaneously consider the label loss of each image and similarity loss of\npairs of images. Experimental results on two remote sensing datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-art retrieval and\nclassification performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 16:45:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

Application\nto turbulent magnetic fields leads to the prediction that tangling magnetic\nfield by turbulence increases magnetic stochasticity. An increasing\nstochasticity in turn leads to disalignments of the coarse-grained fields at\nsmaller scales thus they average to weaker fields at larger scales upon\ncoarse-graining. The field's resistance against tanglement by the turbulence\nmay lead at some point to its sudden slippage through the fluid, decreasing the\nstochasticity and increasing the energy density. Thus the maxima (minima) of\nmagnetic stochasticity are expected to approximately coincide with the minima\n(maxima) of energy density, occurrence of which corresponds to slippage of the\nmagnetic field through the fluid. Field-fluid slippage, on the other hand, has\nbeen already found to be intimately related to magnetic reconnection. In this\npaper, we test these theoretical predictions numerically using a homogeneous,\nincompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. Apart from expected small\nscale deviations, possibly due to e.g., intermittency and strong field\nannihilation, the theoretically predicted global relationship between\nstochasticity and magnetic energy is observed in different sub-volumes of the\nsimulation box. This may indicate ubiquitous local field-fluid slippage and\nsmall scale reconnection events in MHD turbulence. We also show that the\nmaximum magnetic stochasticity, i.e., \\partial_t S(t)=0 & \\partial^2_t S(t)<0,\nleads to sudden increases in kinetic stochasticity level which may correspond\nto fluid jets driven by the reconnecting field lines, i.e., reconnection. This\nsuggests a new mathematical approach to the reconnection problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 17:01:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 02:28:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

Gradient (or optimization) based\nmeta-learning has recently emerged as an effective approach for few-shot\nlearning. In this formulation, meta-parameters are learned in the outer loop,\nwhile task-specific models are learned in the inner-loop, by using only a small\namount of data from the current task. A key challenge in scaling these\napproaches is the need to differentiate through the inner loop learning\nprocess, which can impose considerable computational and memory burdens. By\ndrawing upon implicit differentiation, we develop the implicit MAML algorithm,\nwhich depends only on the solution to the inner level optimization and not the\npath taken by the inner loop optimizer. This effectively decouples the\nmeta-gradient computation from the choice of inner loop optimizer. As a result,\nour approach is agnostic to the choice of inner loop optimizer and can\ngracefully handle many gradient steps without vanishing gradients or memory\nconstraints. Theoretically, we prove that implicit MAML can compute accurate\nmeta-gradients with a memory footprint that is, up to small constant factors,\nno more than that which is required to compute a single inner loop gradient and\nat no overall increase in the total computational cost. Experimentally, we show\nthat these benefits of implicit MAML translate into empirical gains on few-shot\nimage recognition benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 17:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

Here, we report the detection of water vapor and the likely\npresence of liquid and icy water clouds in the atmosphere of the $2.6$\n$R_\\oplus$ habitable-zone planet K2-18b. The simultaneous detection of water\nvapor and clouds in the mid-atmosphere of K2-18b is particularly intriguing\nbecause K2-18b receives virtually the same amount of total insolation from its\nhost star ($1368_{-107}^{+114}$ W m$^{-2}$) as the Earth receives from the Sun\n(1361 W m$^{-2}$), resulting in the right conditions for water vapor to\ncondense and explain the detected clouds. In this study, we observed nine\ntransits of K2-18b using HST/WFC3 in order to achieve the necessary sensitivity\nto detect the water vapor, and we supplement this data set with Spitzer and K2\nobservations to obtain a broader wavelength coverage.

Previously, studies of the\ncorrelation between the UV-to-X-ray spectral index alpha_OX and Eddington ratio\nusing single-epoch observations of changing-look AGN samples have revealed\npossible similarities to the spectral evolution of outbursting X-ray binaries.\nHowever, direct comparisons using multi-epoch UV/X-ray light curves of\nindividual changing-look AGN undergoing dramatic changes in Eddington ratio\nhave been scarce. Here, we use published Swift UV/X-ray light curves of two\nchanging-look AGN (NGC 2617 and ZTF18aajupnt) to examine the evolution of their\nalpha_OX values during outburst. We show that the combination of these two\nchanging-look AGN can trace out the predicted spectral evolution from X-ray\nbinary outbursts, including the inversion in the evolution of alpha_OX as a\nfunction of Eddington ratio. We suggest that the spectral softening that is\nobserved to occur below a critical Eddington ratio in both AGN and X-ray\nbinaries is due to reprocessing of Comptonized X-ray emission by the accretion\ndisk, based on the X-ray to UV reverberation lags previously observed in NGC\n2617.

We investigate\nthe possibilities of producing sneutrino pairs resonantly through a heavy Higgs\nof such a model and the ability of seeing a lepton number violating signature\nemerging from sneutrinos at the Large Hadron Collider. We also discuss how a\npossible future signal of this type could be used to determine the neutrino\nYukawa couplings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 18:10:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 16:28:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

X-ray emission from the Seyfert 2 galaxy GSN\n069 (2MASX J01190869-3411305) at redshift z = 0.018 was first detected in 2010\nJuly and implies an X-ray brightening of more than a factor of 240 over ROSAT\nobservations performed 16 years earlier. The emission has smoothly decayed over\ntime since 2010, possibly indicating a long-lived tidal disruption event. The\nX-ray spectrum is ultra-soft and can be described by accretion disc emission\nwith luminosity proportional to the fourth power of the disc temperature during\nlong-term evolution. Here we report observations of X-ray quasi-periodic\neruptions from the nucleus of GSN 069 over the course of 54 days, 2018 December\nonwards. During these eruptions, the X-ray count rate increases by up to two\norders of magnitude with event duration of just over 1 hour and recurrence time\nof about 9 hours. These eruptions are associated with fast spectral transitions\nbetween a cold and a warm phase in the accretion flow around a low-mass black\nhole (of approximately 4x10$^5$ solar masses) with peak X-ray luminosity of ~\n5x10$^{42}$ ergs per second. The warm phase has a temperature of about 120 eV,\nreminiscent of the typical soft X-ray excess, an almost universal thermal-like\nfeature in the X-ray spectra of luminous active nuclei. If the observed\nproperties are not unique to GSN 069, and assuming standard scaling of\ntimescales with black hole mass and accretion properties, typical active\ngalactic nuclei with more massive black holes can be expected to exhibit\nhigh-amplitude optical to X-ray variability on timescales as short as months or\nyears.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 18:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-12"}

Differential games offer an\nexpressive theoretical framework for formulating these types of multi-agent\nproblems. Unfortunately, most numerical solution techniques scale poorly with\nstate dimension and are rarely used in real-time applications. For this reason,\nit is common to predict the future decisions of other agents and solve the\nresulting decoupled, i.e., single-agent, optimal control problem. This\ndecoupling neglects the underlying interactive nature of the problem; however,\nefficient solution techniques do exist for broad classes of optimal control\nproblems.

In order to explain this variation, we constructed a model in\nwhich Varuna has a simple triaxial shape, assuming that the main effect comes\nfrom the change of the aspect angle as seen from Earth, due to Varuna's orbital\nmotion in the 19-year time span.

Recent research on machine learning\nparameterizations has focused only on deterministic parameterizations. In this\nstudy, we develop a stochastic parameterization using the generative\nadversarial network (GAN) machine learning framework.

Here we propose a method called Spectrally\nResolved Estimation (SRE) for entropy, energy and free energy which is based on\nthe spectral density of vibrations and is inspired by the quasi-harmonic ansatz\nin solid-state physics. It (a) yields, in contrast with other methods, a lower\nlimit of entropy and an upper limit of free energy, is (b) not corrupted by\ndiffusion, (c) assigns entropic contributions to spectral features and thus\nreveals the localization and the type of motion underlying these contributions.\nThe spatial extent of conformational transitions has no influence. The method\napplies to systems of finite volume and is exact for harmonic systems.

This study focuses on the\ndevelopment of three-dimensional separated flow over the wing, and discuss flow\nstructures formed on the wing surface as well as in the far field wake.\nVorticity is introduced into the flow in a predominantly two-dimensional\nmanner. The vortex sheet from the wing tip rolls up around the free end to form\nthe tip vortex. At its inception, the tip vortex is weak and its effect is\nspatially confined. As the flow around the tip separates, the tip effects\nextend farther in the spanwise direction, generating noticeable three\ndimensionality in the wake. For low-aspect-ratio wings, the wake remains stable\ndue to the strong downwash over the entire span. Increasing the aspect ratio\nallows unsteady vortical flow to emerge away from the tip at sufficiently high\nangles of attack. These unsteady vortices shed and form closed vortical loops.\nFor higher-aspect-ratio wings, the tip effects retard the near-tip shedding\nprocess, which desynchronizes from the two-dimensional shedding over the\nmid-span region, yielding vortex dislocation. At high angles of attack, the tip\nvortex exhibits noticeable undulations due to the strong interaction with the\nunsteady shedding vortices. The spanwise distribution of force coefficients is\nrelated to the three-dimensional wake dynamics and the tip effects. Vortical\nelements in the wake that are responsible for the generation of lift and drag\nforces are identified through the force element analysis. We note that at high\nangles of attack, a stationary vortical structure forms at the leading edge\nnear the tip, giving rise to locally high lift and drag forces. The analysis\nperformed here reveals how the vortical flow around the tip influences the\nseparation physics, the global wake dynamics, and the spanwise force\ndistributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 20:18:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

While the case of spatial distribution\nvariation allows achieving consistency between different data. Also we consider\nstable form of dark matter which can interact with baryons.

Recently one of the main communications\narchitectures that makes use of antenna arrays is the Multiple-Input\nMultiple-Output (MIMO) technology. MIMO technology has been applied in antenna\narrays composed of elements in the order of tens to hundreds. In this way, it\nis necessary to use the structure of compact antennas that offer all the\nnecessary robustness to the applied project. In this context, it is important\nto revisit the concepts of mutual coupling and impedance matching among antenna\nelements in an array. This paper proposes and evaluates three strategies of\njoint decoupling and impedance matching networks(DMN) for antenna arrays. The\nfirst method called DMN with Lumped Elements (DMN-LE) performs the decoupling\nand impedance matching steps with capacitors and inductors. The second method\nis called the Ring Hybrid (DMN-RH). It is utilizes a microstrip line in the\nring form. With this approach is achieved first the decoupling followed by\nimpedance matching steps. The third method is called Networkless Decoupling and\nMatching (NDM). It brings a concept of decoupling without the presence of a\nnetwork itself. A comparison of the methods is performed both analytically and\nvia computer simulations. We conclude that the third method, networkless one,\nis an interesting new alternative approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 20:34:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-12"}

This\nframework relaxes assumptions in the literature by considering multiple origins\nand destinations, multiple access locations to the managed lane, en route\ndiversion of travelers, partial observability of the sensor readings, and\nstochastic demand and observations. The problem is formulated as a partially\nobservable Markov decision process (POMDP) and policy gradient methods are used\nto determine tolls as a function of real-time observations. Tolls are modeled\nas continuous and stochastic variables, and are determined using a feedforward\nneural network. The method is compared against a feedback control method used\nfor dynamic pricing. We show that Deep-RL is effective in learning toll\npolicies for maximizing revenue, minimizing total system travel time, and other\njoint weighted objectives, when tested on real-world transportation networks.\nThe Deep-RL toll policies outperform the feedback control heuristic for the\nrevenue maximization objective by generating revenues up to 9.5% higher than\nthe heuristic and for the objective minimizing total system travel time (TSTT)\nby generating TSTT up to 10.4% lower than the heuristic.

This policy can fail due to many reasons, including ubiquitous\ncalibration error. Recovery from a failed grasp is further complicated by\nvisual occlusion, as the hand is usually occluding the vision sensor as it\nattempts another open-loop regrasp. This work presents MAT, a tactile\nclosed-loop method capable of realizing grasps provided by a coarse initial\npositioning of the hand above an object. Our algorithm is a deep reinforcement\nlearning (RL) policy optimized through the clipped surrogate objective within a\nmaximum entropy RL framework to balance exploitation and exploration. The\nmethod utilizes tactile and proprioceptive information to act through both fine\nfinger motions and larger regrasp movements to execute stable grasps. A novel\ncurriculum of action motion magnitude makes learning more tractable and helps\nturn common failure cases into successes. Careful selection of features that\nexhibit small sim-to-real gaps enables this tactile grasping policy, trained\npurely in simulation, to transfer well to real world environments without the\nneed for additional learning. Experimentally, this methodology improves over a\nvision-only grasp success rate substantially on a multi-fingered robot hand.\nWhen this methodology is used to realize grasps from coarse initial positions\nprovided by a vision-only planner, the system is made dramatically more robust\nto calibration errors in the camera-robot transform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 23:02:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 00:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-11"}

We show that Krasulina's update\ncorresponds to a projected gradient descent step on the Stiefel manifold of the\northonormal $k$-frames, while Oja's update amounts to a gradient descent step\nusing the unprojected gradient. Following these observations, we derive a more\n\\emph{implicit} form of Krasulina's $k$-PCA update, i.e. a version that uses\nthe information of the future gradient as much as possible. Most interestingly,\nour implicit Krasulina update avoids the costly QR-decomposition step by\nbypassing the orthonormality constraint. We show that the new update in fact\ncorresponds to an online EM step applied to a probabilistic $k$-PCA model. The\nprobabilistic view of the updates allows us to combine multiple models in a\ndistributed setting. We show experimentally that the implicit Krasulina update\nyields superior convergence while being significantly faster. We also give\nstrong evidence that the new update can benefit from parallelism and is more\nstable w.r.t. tuning of the learning rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 00:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-12"}

To tackle this problem, the Dual-attention\nFocused Module (DFM) is proposed to enhance object localization performance.\nSpecifically, we present a dual attention module for information fusion,\nconsisting of a position branch and a channel one. In each branch, the input\nfeature map is deduced into an enhancement map and a mask map, thereby\nhighlighting the most discriminative parts or hiding them. For the position\nmask map, we introduce a focused matrix to enhance it, which utilizes the\nprinciple that the pixels of an object are continuous.

This simple concept in\ngeneral topology may be employed in the study of physical systems described by\nfields. Instead of continuously deforming objects, we can take a continuously\nevolving field, with an appropriately defined topology, such that the topology\nremains unchanged in time unless the system undergoes an important physical\nchange, e.g., a transition to a different energy state.

Although Deep\nNeural Networks (DNNs) have achieved excellent performance in video\nclassification, recent research shows adding imperceptible perturbations to\nclean videos can make the well-trained models output wrong labels with high\nconfidence. In this paper, we propose an effective defense framework to\ncharacterize and defend adversarial videos. The proposed method contains two\nphases: (1) adversarial video detection using temporal consistency between\nadjacent frames, and (2) adversarial perturbation reduction via denoisers in\nthe spatial and temporal domains respectively. Specifically, because of the\nlinear nature of DNNs, the imperceptible perturbations will enlarge with the\nincreasing of DNNs depth, which leads to the inconsistency of DNNs output\nbetween adjacent frames. However, the benign video frames often have the same\noutputs with their neighbor frames owing to the slight changes. Based on this\nobservation, we can distinguish between adversarial videos and benign videos.\nAfter that, we utilize different defense strategies against different attacks.\nWe propose the temporal defense, which reconstructs the polluted frames with\ntheir temporally neighbor clean frames, to deal with the adversarial videos\nwith sparse polluted frames. For the videos with dense polluted frames, we use\nan efficient adversarial denoiser to process each frame in the spatial domain,\nand thus purify the perturbations (we call it as spatial defense).

Optimization of bubble related applications needs a\nrealistic estimation of the medium attenuation and bubble activity. A correct\nestimation of the wave attenuation in bubbly media requires an accurate\nestimation of the power dissipated by nonlinear oscillations of bubbles.\nPioneering work of Louisnard \\cite{1} meticulously derived the nonlinear energy\nterms for viscous and thermal damping; however, radiation damping arising from\nthe compressibility of the liquid was neglected.

To facilitate controller design, we present an efficient modelling\napproach in which we utilise the resolvent operator to recast the linearised\nNavier-Stokes equations into an input-output form from which frequency\nresponses can be computed. The difficulty of applying modern control design\ntechniques to complex, high-dimensional flow systems is thus overcome by using\nlow-order models identified from these frequency responses. The low-order\nmodels are used to design optimal control laws using $\\mathcal{H}_{\\infty}$\nloop shaping. Two distinct control arrangements are considered, both of which\nemploy a single-input and a single-output. In the first control arrangement, a\nvelocity sensor located in the wake drives a pair of body forces near the\ncylinder. Complete suppression of shedding is observed up to a Reynolds number\nof $Re=110$. Due to the convective nature of vortex shedding and the\ncorresponding time delays, we observe a fundamental trade-off: the sensor\nshould be close enough to the cylinder to avoid any excessive time lag, but it\nshould be kept sufficiently far from the cylinder to measure any unstable modes\ndeveloping downstream. It is found that these two conflicting requirements\nbecome more difficult to satisfy for larger Reynolds numbers. In the second\ncontrol arrangement, we consider a practical setup with a body-mounted force\nsensor and an actuator that oscillates the cylinder according to the lift\nmeasurement. It is shown that the system is stabilised only up to $Re=100$, and\nwe demonstrate why the performance of the resulting feedback controllers\ndeteriorates much more rapidly with increasing Reynolds number. The challenges\nof designing robust controllers for each control setup are also analysed and\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 06:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

IMU is a low-cost motion sensor which provides measurements on angular\nvelocity and gravity compensated linear acceleration of a moving platform, and\nwidely used in modern localization systems. To date, most existing\ninertial-aided localization methods exploit only one single IMU. While the\nsingle-IMU localization yields acceptable accuracy and robustness for different\nuse cases, the overall performance can be further improved by using multiple\nIMUs. To this end, we propose a lightweight and accurate algorithm for fusing\nmeasurements from multiple IMUs and exteroceptive sensors, which is able to\nobtain noticeable performance gain without incurring additional computational\ncost. To achieve this, we first probabilistically map measurements from all\nIMUs onto a virtual IMU. This step is performed by stochastic estimation with\nleast-square estimators and probabilistic marginalization of inter-IMU\nrotational accelerations. Subsequently, the propagation model for both state\nand error state of the virtual IMU is also derived, which enables the use of\nthe classical filter-based or optimization-based sensor fusion algorithms for\nlocalization. Finally, results from both simulation and real-world tests are\nprovided, which demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms competing\nalgorithms by noticeable margins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 06:38:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 09:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-20"}

As\nsuch, language models have been investigated for incorporation with NMT. In\nprior investigations, two models have been used: a translation model and a\nlanguage model. The translation model's predictions are weighted by the\nlanguage model with a hand-crafted ratio in advance. However, these approaches\nfail to adopt the language model weighting with regard to the translation\nhistory. In another line of approach, language model prediction is incorporated\ninto the translation model by jointly considering source and target\ninformation. However, this line of approach is limited because it largely\nignores the adequacy of the translation output.\n  Accordingly, this work employs two mechanisms, the translation model and the\nlanguage model, with an attentive architecture to the language model as an\nauxiliary element of the translation model.

Despite\nthe significant benefits brought by ML techniques, they also raise additional\nsafety issues because 1) most expressive and powerful ML models are not\ntransparent and behave as a black box and 2) the training data which plays a\ncrucial role in ML safety is usually incomplete. An important technique to\nachieve safety for ML models is \"Safe Fail\", i.e., a model selects a reject\noption and applies the backup solution, a traditional controller or a human\noperator for example, when it has low confidence in a prediction.\n  Data-driven models produced by ML algorithms learn from training data, and\nhence they are only as good as the examples they have learnt. As pointed in\n[17], ML models work well in the \"training space\" (i.e., feature space with\nsufficient training data), but they could not extrapolate beyond the training\nspace. As observed in many previous studies, a feature space that lacks\ntraining data generally has a much higher error rate than the one that contains\nsufficient training samples [31]. Therefore, it is essential to identify the\ntraining space and avoid extrapolating beyond the training space.

In this work we study new\nphysics effects on $l_1$-norm based measure of quantum coherence which\nquantifies the quantumness embedded in the system and is also intrinsically\nrelated to various measures of quantum correlations. Moreover, it is considered\nto be a resource theoretical tool which can be utilized in quantum algorithms\nand quantum channel discrimination. The new physics effects are incorporated in\na model independent way by using the effective Lagrangian for the neutral\ncurrent non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI). Bounds on the NSI parameters\nare extracted from a recent global analysis of oscillation experiments\nincluding COHERENT (coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering experiment) data. In\nthe context of upcoming DUNE experimental setup, we find that the most\nfavourable combination of LMA-Light sector of $\\theta_{12}$ (i.e.,\n$\\theta_{12}< 45^o$) with normal mass ordering decreases the coherence in the\nsystem in comparison to the SM prediction for all values of neutrino energy E\nand CP violating phase $\\delta$ (except in the narrow region around E ~ 2 GeV).\nOn the other hand, a large enhancement in the value of coherence parameter in\nthe entire $(E-\\delta)$ plane is possible for the dark octant of $\\theta_{12}$\n($\\theta_{12}> 45^o$) with inverted ordering. For almost all values of CP\nviolating phase, the enhancement is more protuberant in the region around E ~ 4\nGeV where maximum neutrino flux is expected in the DUNE experiment. Therefore\nfor the normal mass ordering, the SM interaction provides favourable conditions\nfor quantum information tasks while the NSI favours inverted ordering scenario\nfor such tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 07:40:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 20:18:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-29"}

We consider a model in which the\ntransmitter wishes to send different confidential (and non-confidential)\ninformation to each legitimate receiver. First, we compare two inner-bounds on\nthe achievable region of this model from the literature, and then we design a\npolar coding scheme that achieves the stronger one. In the proposed scheme, the\nencoding uses polar-based Marton's coding, where one inner-layer must be\nreliably decoded by both legitimate receivers, and each receiver must decode\nits own corresponding outer-layer. Due to the non-degradedness condition of the\nbroadcast channel, the encoder builds a chaining construction that induces\nbidirectional dependencies between adjacent blocks. Indeed, these dependencies\ncan occur between different encoding layers of different blocks. The use of two\nsecret-keys, whose length are negligible in terms of rate, are required to\nprove that the polar code satisfies the strong secrecy condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 08:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-12"}

We collect the representative\nequirectangular images from five mainstream 360$^\\circ$ video datasets and\nmanually annotate all objects and regions over these images with precise masks\nwith a free-viewpoint way.

A\nstriking feature is the existence of robust and chiral wave propagations that\nhave potential applications in many fields. A common way to realize such wave\npatterns is to utilize Dirac points which carry topological indices and is\nsupported by the symmetries of the media. In this work, we investigate these\nphenomena in photonic media. Starting with Maxwell's equations with a honeycomb\nmaterial weight as well as the nonlinear Kerr effect, we first prove the\nexistence of Dirac points in the dispersion surfaces of transverse electric and\nmagnetic Maxwell operators under very general assumptions of the material\nweight. Our assumptions on the material weight are almost the minimal\nrequirements to ensure the existence of Dirac points in a general hexagonal\nphotonic crystal. We then derive the associated wave packet dynamics in the\nscenario where the honeycomb structure is weakly modulated. It turns out the\nreduced envelope equation is generally a two-dimensional nonlinear Dirac\nequation with a spatially varying mass. By studying the reduced envelope\nequation with a domain-wall-like mass term, we realize the subtle wave motions\nwhich are chiral and immune to local defects. The underlying mechanism is the\nexistence of topologically protected linear line modes, also referred to as\nedge states.

The marketplace is implemented as\na collection of distributed microservices along with a marketplace portal that\nruns as a Web application. The heart of Nubo is the Saranyu tenant and service\nmanagement microservice. Saranyu is a decentralized application (dApp) built on\ntop of the J.P. Morgan Quorum blockchain. Tenant and service accounts are\nrepresented as static (nonnegotiable) smart contracts written in the Solidity\nlanguage. Quorum provides a tamper evident and tamper resistant distributed\nledger, whereby multiple cloud and service providers can co-operate to provide\nservice resources to tenants in a trustworthy fashion. Services offer resources\nconsisting of a collection of attributes describing what the tenant can\nconsume, and tenants subscribe to service resources through the Nubo\nMarketplace portal. The Service Manager microservice provides multitenant\nsupport for containerized services built for deployment and orchestration using\nDocker that were originally not designed to be managed through Saranyu. We\ndiscuss our design goals for Nubo, describe the overall architecture, discuss\nsome details on how Saranyu uses the blockchain and smart contracts, and\nprovide comprehensive performance and scalability data measured on the Saranyu\nREST API.

The space velocities, angular\nmomenta and actions for a sample of more than 5.8 million stars, composed from\nGaia DR2, are analysed with a wavelet transform. The kinematic characteristics\nof each identified group is used to select possible members of the groups from\nthe GALAH and APOGEE spectroscopic surveys to further study and constrain their\nchemical properties.

Several studies show that animal\nneeds are often expressed through their faces. Though remarkable progress has\nbeen made towards the automatic understanding of human faces, this has\nregrettably not been the case with animal faces. There exists significant room\nand appropriate need to develop automatic systems capable of interpreting\nanimal faces. Among many transformative impacts, such a technology will foster\nbetter and cheaper animal healthcare, and further advance animal psychology\nunderstanding.\n  We believe the underlying research progress is mainly obstructed by the lack\nof an adequately annotated dataset of animal faces, covering a wide spectrum of\nanimal species. To this end, we introduce a large-scale, hierarchical annotated\ndataset of animal faces, featuring 21.9K faces from 334 diverse species and 21\nanimal orders across biological taxonomy. These faces are captured\n`in-the-wild' conditions and are consistently annotated with 9 landmarks on key\nfacial features. The proposed dataset is structured and scalable by design; its\ndevelopment underwent four systematic stages involving rigorous, manual\nannotation effort of over 6K man-hours. We benchmark it for face alignment\nusing the existing art under novel problem settings. Results showcase its\nchallenging nature, unique attributes and present definite prospects for novel,\nadaptive, and generalized face-oriented CV algorithms. We further benchmark the\ndataset for face detection and fine-grained recognition tasks, to demonstrate\nmulti-task applications and room for improvement. Experiments indicate that\nthis dataset will push the algorithmic advancements across many related CV\ntasks and encourage the development of novel systems for animal facial\nbehaviour monitoring. We will make the dataset publicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 09:55:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-12"}

We also have determined chemical abundances for Li, O,\nNa, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Ni, Rb, Y, and Ba for the evolved stars. The chemical\ncomposition of the cluster is consistent with that of the Galactic thin disc.\nOne of the K supergiants, S50, is a Li-rich star, presenting an\nA(Li)$\\approx$2.1. An overabundance of Ba is found, supporting the enhanced\n$s$-process.\n  NGC 2345 has a low metallicity for its Galactocentric distance, comparable to\ntypical LMC stars.

Thanks to facilities such as ALMA and in the future the SKA, their\nthermal emission in the (sub)mm to cm has become a convenient way to trace\ngrain properties. Our aim is to understand the influence of the grain\ncomposition and size distribution on the shape of their SED in dense ISM\nregions such as molecular clouds, prestellar cores, YSOs and protoplanetary\ndiscs. Starting from the optical constants defined in the THEMIS model for\namorphous hydrogenated carbon and silicate grains in addition to water ice, we\ndefine 6 material mixtures representative of the expected dust composition in\ndense ISM regions. The optical properties of 0.01 micron to 10 cm grains are\nthen calculated with effective medium and Mie theories. The corresponding SEDs\nare calculated for isolated clouds either externally heated by the ISRF alone\nor in addition to an internal source. The 3 main outcomes of this study are as\nfollows. First, the dust mass absorption coefficient strongly depends on both\nits composition and size distribution potentially leading to errors in dust\nmass estimates by factors up to 3 and 20, respectively. Second, it appears\nalmost impossible to retrieve the grain composition from the (sub)mm to cm SED\nshape alone as its spectral index for lambda > 3 mm does not depend on\ncomposition. Third, using the true dust opacity spectral index to estimate\ngrain sizes may lead to erroneous findings as the observed spectral index can\nbe highly modified by the dust temperature distribution along the\nline-of-sight, which depends on the specific heating source and on the geometry\nof the studied region. Based on the interpretation of only the spectral shape\nof (sub)mm to cm SEDs, the determination of the dust masses, compositions and\nsizes are highly uncertain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 12:52:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 10:05:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

Unfortunately, in proof assistants based on type theory,\nequality is appallingly syntactic and, as a result, exploiting equivalences is\ncumbersome at best. Parametricity and univalence are two major concepts that\nhave been explored to transport programs and proofs across type equivalences,\nbut they fall short of achieving seamless, automatic transport. This work first\nclarifies the limitations of these two concepts in isolation, and then devises\na fruitful marriage between both. The resulting concept, univalent\nparametricity, is an heterogeneous extension of parametricity strengthened with\nunivalence that fully realizes programming and proving modulo equivalences. In\naddition to the theory of univalent parametricity, we present a lightweight\nframework implemented in Coq that allows the user to transparently transfer\ndefinitions and theorems for a type to an equivalent one, as if they were\nequal. For instance, this makes it possible to conveniently switch between an\neasy-to-reason-about representation and a computationally-efficient\nrepresentation, as soon as they are proven equivalent.

Various innovative models for data\nsharing and management have privacy and centrality issues. To alleviate these\nlimitations, we have incorporated blockchain in user modeling. In this paper,\nwe constructed a decentralized data sharing architecture with MultiChain\nblockchain in the travel domain, which is also applicable to other similar\ndomains including education, health, and sports. Businesses that operate in the\ntourism industries including travel and tour agencies, hotels and resorts,\nshopping malls are connected to the MultiChain and they share their user\nprofile data via stream in the MultiChain. The paper presents the hotel booking\nservice for an imaginary hotel as one of the enterprise nodes, which collects\nuser profile data with proper validation and will allow users to decide which\nof their data to be shared thus ensuring user control over their data and the\npreservation of privacy. The data from the repository is converted into an open\ndata format while sharing via stream in the blockchain so that other enterprise\nnodes, after receiving the data, can easily convert them and store into their\nown repositories. The paper presents an evaluation of the performance of the\nmodel by measuring the latency and memory consumption with three test scenarios\nthat mostly affect the user experience.

We provide a\nframework to systematically exploit available symmetries, formulated in terms\nof covariance, to simplify problems of measurement uncertainty. Our key result\nis that for a wide range figures of merit the optimal compatible approximations\nof covariant target observables are themselves covariant. This substantially\nsimplifies the problem of determining measurement uncertainty regions for cases\nwhere it applies, since the space of covariant observables is typically much\nsmaller than that of all observables. An intermediate result, which may be\napplicable more broadly, is the existence and characterisation of a\ncovariantisation map, mapping observables to covariant observables.

Apart from a general dispersion relation, we provide\nvery simple analytical expressions in typical experiments in nano-optics: the\nlimits of short polaritonic wavelength and/or very thin slabs. The results of\nour study will allow for an in-depth analysis of anisotropic polaritons in\nnovel biaxial van der Waals materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 14:09:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 09:57:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 17:27:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

Without careful attention, and if PWD are not included as\nequal participants throughout the process, there is a danger of perpetuating a\nvision-first approach to accessible design that marginalizes the lived\nexperience of disability (e.g., by creating overly simplistic \"sensory\ntranslations\" that map visual to non-visual modalities in a one-to-one\nfashion). In this paper, we present a set of sociotechnical considerations for\nresearch in accessible visualization design, drawing on literature in\ndisability studies, tactile information systems, and participatory methods. We\nidentify that using state-of-the-art technologies may introduce more barriers\nto access than they remove, and that expectations of research novelty may not\nproduce outcomes well-aligned with the needs of disability communities.\nInstead, to promote a more inclusive design process, we emphasize the\nimportance of clearly communicating goals, following existing accessibility\nguidelines, and treating PWD as equal participants who are compensated for\ntheir specialized skills. To illustrate how these considerations can be applied\nin practice, we discuss a case study of an inclusive design workshop held in\ncollaboration with the Perkins School for the Blind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 15:11:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-12"}

They are\nresponsible for a wealth of phenomena, which are not simple extensions of\nnear-equilibrium properties, ranging from fluid flows turning turbulent to the\nhighly organized forms of life. On the fundamental level, quantum fluctuations\nor entanglement lead to novel forms of complex dynamical behaviour in many-body\nsystems for which a description as emergent phenomena can be found within the\nframework of quantum field theory. A central quantity in these efforts,\ncontaining all information about the measurable physical properties, is the\nquantum effective action. Though the problem of non-equilibrium quantum\ndynamics can be exactly formulated in terms of the quantum effective action,\nthe solution is in general beyond capabilities of classical computers.

Consequently, new challenges are expected for inter-system\nsatellite coexistence due to the increased interference level and the\ncomplexity of the interactions resulting from the heterogeneity of the\nconstellations. This is especially relevant for the Ku-band, where the NGSO\nsystems are most diverse and existing GSO systems, which often support critical\nservices, must be protected from interference. It is thus imperative to\nevaluate the impact of mutual inter-system interference, the efficiency of the\nbasic interference mitigation techniques, and whether regulatory intervention\nis needed for the new systems. We conduct an extensive study of inter-satellite\ncoexistence in the Ku-band, where we consider all recently proposed NGSO and\nsome selected GSO systems. Our throughput degradation results suggest that\nexisting spectrum regulation may be insufficient to ensure GSO protection from\nNGSO interference, especially due to the high transmit power of the LEO Kepler\nsatellites. This also results in strong interference towards other NGSO\nsystems, where traditional interference mitigation techniques like look-aside\nmay perform poorly. Specifically, look-aside can be beneficial for large\nconstellations, but detrimental for small constellations. Furthermore, we\nconfirm that band-splitting among satellite operators significantly degrades\nthroughput, also for the Ku-band. Our results overall show that the complexity\nof the inter-satellite interactions for new NGSO systems is too high to be\nmanaged via simple interference mitigation techniques. This means that more\nsophisticated engineering solutions, and potentially even more strict\nregulatory requirements, will be needed to ensure coexistence in emerging,\ndense NGSO deployments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 15:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-12"}

Capturing the complete multi-time statistics\ndefining a stochastic process lies at the heart of any proper treatment of\nmemory effects. In this thesis, using a novel framework for the\ncharacterisation of quantum stochastic processes, we first solve the long\nstanding question of unambiguously describing the memory length of a quantum\nprocesses. This is achieved by constructing a quantum Markov order condition\nthat naturally generalises its classical counterpart for the quantification of\nfinite-length memory effects. As measurements are inherently invasive in\nquantum mechanics, one has no choice but to define Markov order with respect to\nthe interrogating instruments that are used to probe the process at hand:\ndifferent memory effects are exhibited depending on how one addresses the\nsystem, in contrast to the standard classical setting.

While this is easily\nfeasible when measurements are acquired from a large number of projection\nviews, it is challenging when the number of views is limited.

However, these methods cannot well reflect the complexity and\nsubtlety of emotions. In this paper, we study the fine-grained regression\nproblem of visual emotions based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\nSpecifically, we develop a Polarity-consistent Deep Attention Network (PDANet),\na novel network architecture that integrates attention into a CNN with an\nemotion polarity constraint. First, we propose to incorporate both spatial and\nchannel-wise attentions into a CNN for visual emotion regression, which jointly\nconsiders the local spatial connectivity patterns along each channel and the\ninterdependency between different channels. Second, we design a novel\nregression loss, i.e. polarity-consistent regression (PCR) loss, based on the\nweakly supervised emotion polarity to guide the attention generation. By\noptimizing the PCR loss, PDANet can generate a polarity preserved attention map\nand thus improve the emotion regression performance. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on the IAPS, NAPS, and EMOTIC datasets, and the results demonstrate\nthat the proposed PDANet outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large\nmargin for fine-grained visual emotion regression.

The\nexistence of such trajectories is a desirable property of any forecast model.\nGradient descent of indeterminism is a well-established technique for finding\nshadowing trajectories in low-dimensional analytical systems. Here we apply it\nto the thermally-driven rotating annulus, a laboratory experiment intermediate\nin model complexity and physical idealisation between analytical systems and\nglobal, comprehensive atmospheric models. We work in the perfect model scenario\nusing the MORALS model to generate a sequence of noisy observations in a\nchaotic flow regime. We demonstrate that the gradient descent technique\nrecovers a pseudo-orbit of model states significantly closer to a model\ntrajectory than the initial sequence. Gradient-free descent is used, where the\nadjoint model is set to $\\lambda$I in the absence of a full adjoint model. The\nindeterminism of the pseudo-orbit falls by two orders of magnitude during the\ndescent, but we find that the distance between the pseudo-orbit and the\ninitial, true, model trajectory reaches a minimum and then diverges from truth.\nWe attribute this to the use of the $\\lambda$-adjoint, which is well suited to\nnoise reduction but not to finely-tuned convergence towards a model trajectory.\nWe find that $\\lambda=0.25$ gives optimal results, and that candidate model\ntrajectories begun from this pseudo-orbit shadow the observations for up to 80\ns, about the length of the longest timescale of the system, and similar to\nexpected shadowing times based on the distance between the pseudo-orbit and the\ntruth.

In fact the core has\nthe structure of a tennis-ball (bubble) like nucleus, with a \"hole\" at the\ncentre of the density distribution. This novel interpretation of the fusion\nexperiment provides an unambigous support to an almost two decades old model\n(Abbas, Mod. Phys. Lett. A 16 (2001) 755), of the halo nuclei. This Quantum\nChromodyanamics based model, succeeds in identifyng all known halo nuclei and\nmakes clear-cut and unique predictions for new and heavier halo nuclei.

The proposed scheme incorporates\na pressure-correction type strategy into the gPAV procedure, and it satisfies a\ndiscrete energy stability property. The scheme entails the computation of two\ncopies of the velocity and pressure within a time step, by solving an\nindividual de-coupled linear equation for each of these field variables. Upon\ndiscretization the pressure linear system involves a constant coefficient\nmatrix that can be pre-computed, while the velocity linear system involves a\ncoefficient matrix that is updated periodically, once every $k_0$ time steps in\nthe current work, where $k_0$ is a user-specified integer.

Many countries (e.g.\nEgypt) are planning to meet increasing electricity demands by increasing both\nrenewable (especially wind energy) and nuclear energies contributions in\nelectricity generation. In the planning phase of siting both new Wind Farms\n(WFs) and Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs), many benefits and challenges exist. An\nimportant aspect taken into consideration during the NPP siting is the\nexistence of ultimate heat sink which is sea water in most cases. That is why\nmost NPPs are sited on sea coasts.

Second, we present an analysis on temporal\ntrends of pro-peace and pro-war intent observing that when tensions between the\ntwo nations were at their peak, pro-peace intent in the corpus was at its\nhighest point. Finally, in the context of heated discussions in a politically\ntense situation where two nations are at the brink of a full-fledged war, we\nargue the importance of automatic identification of user-generated web content\nthat can diffuse hostility and address this prediction task, dubbed\n\\emph{hope-speech detection}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 04:22:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 20:21:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 22:37:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 05:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}

However, scaling PIC phased arrays to a large number\nof array elements is limited by the large size and high power consumption of\nindividual phase shifters used for beam steering. In this paper, we demonstrate\nsilicon PIC phased array beam steering based on thermally tuned ultracompact\nmicroring resonator phase shifters with a radius of a few microns. These\nresonators integrated with micro-heaters are designed to be strongly coupled to\nan external waveguide, thereby providing a large and adjustable phase shift\nwith a small residual amplitude modulation while consuming an average power of\n0.4 mW. We also introduce characterization techniques for the calibration of\nresonator phase shifters in the phased array. With such compact phase shifters\nand our calibration techniques, we demonstrate beam steering with a 1x8 PIC\nphased array. The small size of these resonator phase shifters will enable\nlow-power and ultra-large scale PIC phased arrays for long distance laser\ncommunication systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 21:39:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

As a first step, a\nLarge Eddy Simulation is carried out in air without heating to study the\ndevelopment of the turbulent flow. The CFD code used is TrioCFD, a code\ndeveloped by the CEA. For validation purpose, the simulation is carried out in\nthe experimental setup configuration: a closed-loop wind tunnel called TRANSAT.\nTwo horizontal plates, separated by 0.05 m, are put in the airflow to represent\nthe amplifier plates. Turbulent boundary layers develop from the plates edges.\nNumerically, the entrance flow is a homogeneous planar flow with a constant\nvelocity at 10 m/s.

These proteins\nbind to the ice crystals, hindering their growth into large ice lattice that\ncould cause physical damage. There are variety of AFPs found in numerous\norganisms and due to the heterogeneous sequence characteristics, AFPs are found\nto demonstrate a high degree of diversity, which makes their prediction a\nchallenging task. Herein, we propose a machine learning framework to deal with\nthis vigorous and diverse prediction problem using the manifolding learning\nthrough composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs. We propose to use the deep\nneural network with skipped connection and ReLU non-linearity to learn the\nnon-linear mapping of protein sequence descriptor and class label. The proposed\nantifreeze protein prediction method called AFP-CKSAAP has shown to outperform\nthe contemporary methods, achieving excellent prediction scores on standard\ndataset. The main evaluater for the performance of the proposed method in this\nstudy is Youden's index whose high value is dependent on both sensitivity and\nspecificity. In particular, AFP-CKSAAP yields a Youden's index value of 0.82 on\nthe independent dataset, which is better than previous methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 03:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}
