We consider an atom whose internal degrees of\nfreedom are modeled by a harmonic oscillator, bilinearly coupled to a scalar\nquantum field, representing one of the two polarizations of an electromagnetic\nfield. Because the whole system is Gaussian we can solve this problem exactly.\nUsing the open quantum system conceptual framework and the influence functional\nformalism we derive the dynamics of the reduced density matrix for the atom\nwhich enables the calculation of atomic transition probability and other\nrelevant physical quantities. Finding an exact solution to this problem has the\ndistinct advantage of enabling one to capture fully the strong coupling regime\nand discover interesting effects such as spontaneous ground state excitation\nwhich is unfathomable in perturbative treatments. The conventional description\nof atomic-optical activities is predicated on the assumption that the state of\nthe total atom-field system is a product state of the atomic excitations and\nthe photon number states, an assumption which is valid only for vanishingly\nweak coupling. The correct energy eigenfunctions to use should be that of the\nHamiltonian of the combined atom-field system. Other features associated with\nfinite to strong coupling effects such as resonance peak broadening and\ntransition from a gapped to a gapless spectrum can all be understood from this\nperspective. Finally, to put the issues in a proper perspective we take the\nperturbative limit of the exact results and compare them with those from\nconventional TDPT.

The relationship between outflow launching and formation of\naccretion disks around young stellar objects is still not entirely understood,\nwhich is why spectrally and spatially resolved observations are needed.\nRecently, the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) has carried\nout long-baseline observations towards a handful of sources, revealing\nconnections between outflows and the inner regions of disks.\n  Aims. Here we aim to determine the small-scale kinematic and morphological\nproperties of the outflow from the isolated protostar B335 for which no\nKeplerian disk has, so far, been observed on scales down to 10 au.\n  Methods. We use ALMA in its longest-baseline configuration to observe\nemission from CO isotopologs, SiO, SO$_2$ and CH$_3$OH. The proximity of B335\nprovides a resolution of ~3 au (0.03''). We also combine our long-baseline data\nwith archival data to produce a high-fidelity image covering scales up to 700\nau (7'').\n  Results. $^{12}$CO has a X-shaped morphology with arms ~50 au in width that\nwe associate with the walls of an outflow cavity, similar to what is observed\non larger scales. Long-baseline continuum emission is confined to <7 au of the\nprotostar, while short-baseline continuum emission follows the $^{12}$CO\noutflow and cavity walls.

CH$_3$OH and SO$_2$ trace a region\n<16 au in diameter, centred on the continuum peak, which is clearly rotating.\nUsing episodic, high-velocity, $^{12}$CO features, we estimate the launching\nradius of the outflow to be <0.1 au and dynamical timescales on the order of a\nfew years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 16:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

However, to release the\nperformance potential of HM, we face a problem of data management. Given an\napplication with various execution phases and each with possibly distinct\nworking sets, we must move data between memory components of HM to optimize\nperformance. The deep neural network (DNN), as a common workload on data\ncenters, imposes great challenges on data management on HM. This workload often\nemploys a task dataflow execution model, and is featured with a large amount of\nsmall data objects and fine-grained operations (tasks). This execution model\nimposes challenges on memory profiling and efficient data migration.\n  We present Sentinel, a runtime system that automatically optimizes data\nmigration (i.e., data management) on HM to achieve performance similar to that\non the fast memory-only system with a much smaller capacity of fast memory. To\nachieve this,Sentinel exploits domain knowledge about deep learning to adopt a\ncustom approach for data management. Sentinel leverages workload repeatability\nto break the dilemma between profiling accuracy and overhead; It enables\nprofiling and data migration at the granularity of data objects (not pages), by\ncontrolling memory allocation. This method bridges the semantic gap between\noperating system and applications. By associating data objects with the DNN\ntopology, Sentinel avoids unnecessary data movement and proactively triggers\ndata movement. Using only 20% of peak memory consumption of DNN models as fast\nmemory size, Sentinel achieves the same or comparable performance (at most 8%\nperformance difference) to that of the fast memory-only system on common DNN\nmodels; Sentinel also consistently outperforms a state-of-the-art solution by\n18%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 16:30:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-12"}

A dramatic phenomenon is that, after pausing the interaction\nmodulation for half a period and then continuing on with the same modulation,\nnearly all the excited quasi-particles in the resonance modes will be absorbed\nback into the condensate.

We convert colorful images into\ngrayscale images with a color-encoding mask. Using the mask, reconstructed\nimages retain their basic color without red and blue mixing, which is important\nfor cytopathological image interpretation. The style reconstruction module\nconsists of per-pixel regression with intradomain adversarial learning,\ninter-domain adversarial learning, and optional task-based refining. Per-pixel\nregression with intradomain adversarial learning establishes the generative\nnetwork from the decolorized input to the reconstructed output.

We find 58 new transport\ncoefficients, 19 due to third-order scalar corrections and 39 due to tensorial\ncorrections. In the particular case of a conformal fluid, the number of new\ntransport coefficients is reduced to 19, all of them due to third-order\ntensorial corrections.

Bundles and fibers form in a broad variety\nof supramolecular systems, from biological to synthetic materials. A\nwidely-invoked mechanism to explain their finite diameter relies on chirality\ntransfer from the molecular constituents to collective twist of the assembly,\nthe effect of which frustrates the lateral assembly and can select equilibrium,\nfinite diameters of bundles. In this article, the thermodynamics of\ntwisted-bundle assembly is analyzed to understand if chirality transfer is\nnecessary for self-limitation, or instead, if spontaneously-twisting, achiral\nbundles also exhibit self-limited assembly. A generalized description is\ninvoked for the elastic costs imposed by twist for bundles of various states of\nintra-bundle order from nematic to crystalline, as well as a generic mechanism\nfor generating twist, classified both by {\\it chirality} but also the {\\it\ntwist susceptibility} of inter-filament alignment. The theory provides a\ncomprehensive set of predictions for the equilibrium twist and size of bundles\nas a function of surface energy as well as chirality, twist susceptibility, and\nelasticity of bundles. Moreover, it shows that while spontaneous twist can lead\nto self-limitation, assembly of twisted {\\it achiral} bundles can be\ndistinguished qualitatively in terms of their range of equilibrium sizes and\nthermodynamic stability relative to bulk (untwisted) states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 16:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-12"}

In this work, we investigate the spontaneous emission of an\ninitially excited artificial atom which is capacitively coupled to a\nsemi-infinite transmission line, shorted at one end. This configuration can be\nviewed as an atom in front of a mirror. The distance between the atom and the\nmirror introduces a time-delay in the system, which we take into account fully.\nWhen the delay time equals an integer number of atom oscillation periods, the\natom converges into a dark state after an initial decay period. The dark state\nis an effect of destructive interference between the reflected part of the\nfield and the part directly emitted by the atom. Based on circuit quantization,\nwe derive linearized equations of motion for the system and use these for a\nsemiclassical analysis of the transient dynamics. We also make a rigorous\nconnection to the quantum optics system-reservoir approach and compare these\ntwo methods to describe the dynamics. We find that both approaches are\nequivalent for transmission lines with a low characteristic impedance, while\nthey differ when this impedance is higher than the typical impedance of the\nsuperconducting artificial atom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 17:01:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

The results provide both\nqualitative and quantitative new insights into $CP$-violation effects in\nhadronic $B$ decays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 17:09:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 13:43:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

In single particle cryo-EM, the central problem is to reconstruct\nthe three-dimensional structure of a macromolecule from $10^{4-7}$ noisy and\nrandomly oriented two-dimensional projections. However, the imaged protein\ncomplexes may exhibit structural variability, which complicates reconstruction\nand is typically addressed using discrete clustering approaches that fail to\ncapture the full range of protein dynamics. Here, we introduce a novel method\nfor cryo-EM reconstruction that extends naturally to modeling continuous\ngenerative factors of structural heterogeneity. This method encodes structures\nin Fourier space using coordinate-based deep neural networks, and trains these\nnetworks from unlabeled 2D cryo-EM images by combining exact inference over\nimage orientation with variational inference for structural heterogeneity. We\ndemonstrate that the proposed method, termed cryoDRGN, can perform ab initio\nreconstruction of 3D protein complexes from simulated and real 2D cryo-EM image\ndata.

It can be cast\nas an optimization problem with triplet constraints. Due to the vast number of\ntriplet constraints, a sampling strategy is essential for DML. With the\ntremendous success of deep learning in classifications, it has been applied for\nDML. When learning embeddings with deep neural networks (DNNs), only a\nmini-batch of data is available at each iteration. The set of triplet\nconstraints has to be sampled within the mini-batch. Since a mini-batch cannot\ncapture the neighbors in the original set well, it makes the learned embeddings\nsub-optimal. On the contrary, optimizing SoftMax loss, which is a\nclassification loss, with DNN shows a superior performance in certain DML\ntasks. It inspires us to investigate the formulation of SoftMax. Our analysis\nshows that SoftMax loss is equivalent to a smoothed triplet loss where each\nclass has a single center. In real-world data, one class can contain several\nlocal clusters rather than a single one, e.g., birds of different poses.\nTherefore, we propose the SoftTriple loss to extend the SoftMax loss with\nmultiple centers for each class.

When the illumination is low, digital cameras increase the ISO\n(electronic gain) to amplify the brightness of captured data. However, this in\nturn amplifies the noise, arising from read, shot, and defective pixel sources.\nIn the raw domain, read and shot noise are effectively modelled using Gaussian\nand Poisson distributions respectively, whereas defective pixels can be modeled\nwith impulsive noise. In extreme low light imaging, noise removal becomes a\ncritical challenge to produce a high quality, detailed image with low noise. In\nthis paper, we propose a multi-task deep neural network called Noise\nDecomposition (NODE) that explicitly and separately estimates defective pixel\nnoise, in conjunction with Gaussian and Poisson noise, to denoise an extreme\nlow light image. Our network is purposely designed to work with raw data, for\nwhich the noise is more easily modeled before going through non-linear\ntransformations in the image signal processing (ISP) pipeline. Quantitative and\nqualitative evaluation show the proposed method to be more effective at\ndenoising real raw images than state-of-the-art techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 17:27:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-13"}

Various\nimplementations of perturbation theory provide solutions in portions of\nparameter space, but only where hierarchies of masses or separations exist.\nNumerical integrations show that bound, non-hierarchical triples of Newtonian\npoint particles will almost always disintegrate into a single escaping star and\na stable, bound binary, but the chaotic nature of the three-body problem\nprevents the derivation of tractable analytic formulae deterministically\nmapping initial conditions to final outcomes. However, chaos also motivates the\nassumption of ergodicity, suggesting that the distribution of outcomes is\nuniform across the accessible phase volume. Here, we use the ergodic hypothesis\nto derive a complete statistical solution to the non-hierarchical three-body\nproblem, one which provides closed-form distributions of outcomes (e.g. binary\norbital elements) given the conserved integrals of motion. We compare our\noutcome distributions to large ensembles of numerical three-body integrations,\nand find good agreement, so long as we restrict ourselves to \"resonant\"\nencounters (the ~50% of scatterings that undergo chaotic evolution). In\nanalyzing our scattering experiments, we identify \"scrambles\" (periods in time\nwhere no pairwise binaries exist) as the key dynamical state that ergodicizes a\nnon-hierarchical triple. The generally super-thermal distributions of survivor\nbinary eccentricity that we predict have notable applications to many\nastrophysical scenarios. For example, non-hierarchical triples produced\ndynamically in globular clusters are a primary formation channel for black hole\nmergers, but the rates and properties of the resulting gravitational waves\ndepend on the distribution of post-disintegration eccentricities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 18:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

First, we use a complete perturbation theory model that\nproperly takes into account the non-linear effects of dark matter clustering,\nshort-scale physics, galaxy bias, redshift-space distortions, and large-scale\nbulk flows. Second, we employ a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo technique and\nconsistently reevaluate the full power spectrum likelihood as we scan over\ndifferent cosmologies.

However,\nby optimizing via such domain classification discrepancy, ambiguous target\nsamples that are not smoothly distributed on the low-dimensional data manifold\nare often missed. To solve this issue, we propose a novel Contrastively\nSmoothed Class Alignment (CoSCA) model, that explicitly incorporates both\nintra- and inter-class domain discrepancy to better align ambiguous target\nsamples with the source domain. CoSCA estimates the underlying label hypothesis\nof target samples, and simultaneously adapts their feature representations by\noptimizing a proposed contrastive loss. In addition, Maximum Mean Discrepancy\n(MMD) is utilized to directly match features between source and target samples\nfor better global alignment.

Intrinsic dynamic disorder stems from large thermal\nfluctuations both in intermolecular transfer integrals and (molecular) site\nenergies in weakly interacting van der Waals solids and sources transient\nlocalization of the charge carriers. The molecular vibrations that drive\ntransient localization typically operate at low-frequency (< a-few-hundred\ncm-1), which renders it difficult to assess them experimentally. Hitherto, this\nhas prevented the identification of clear molecular design rules to control and\nreduce dynamic disorder. In addition, the disorder can also be extrinsic, being\ncontrolled by the gate insulator dielectric properties. Here we report on a\ncomprehensive study of charge transport in two closely related n-type molecular\norganic semiconductors using a combination of temperature-dependent inelastic\nneutron scattering and photoelectron spectroscopy corroborated by electrical\nmeasurements, theory and simulations.

Contemporary axiomatic\nset-theoretic systems, for instance, ZFC, are based on CP. PW is not valid for\ninfinite sets. In the last two decades, the topic of sizes of infinite sets has\nresurfaced again in a number of papers. A question of whether it is possible to\ncompare the sizes to comply with PW has been risen and researched.

Is this also true once quantum\nfluctuations have been accounted for? As a test case we study the Hamiltonian\nMean Field (HMF) model for a system of indistinguishable bosons which is\npredicted (according to mean-field theory) to undergo a second-order quantum\nphase transition at zero temperature. The ordered phase is characterized by a\nspontaneously broken $O(2)$ symmetry, which, despite occurring in a\none-dimensional model, is not ruled out by the Mermin-Wagner theorem due to the\npresence of long-range interactions. Nevertheless, a spontaneously broken\nsymmetry implies gapless Goldstone modes whose large fluctuations can restore\nbroken symmetries. In this work, we study the influence of quantum fluctuations\nby projecting the Hamiltonian onto the continuous subspace of symmetry breaking\nmean-field states. We find that the energetic cost of gradients in the center\nof mass wavefunction inhibit the breaking of the $O(2)$ symmetry, but that the\nenergetic cost is very small --- scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(1/N^2)$. Nevertheless,\nfor any finite $N$, no matter how large, this implies that the ground state has\na restored $O(2)$ symmetry. Implications for the finite temperature phases, and\nclassical limit, of the HMF model are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 20:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

NIR observations were performed in\nfast-photometric mode in order to detect any fast variation of the flux and\ncorrelate them with the optical and X-ray light curves. The optical curve shows\nthe typical sinusoidal modulation at the orbital period (4.75hr). No flaring or\nflickering is found in the optical, neither signs of transitions between active\nand passive states. On the contrary, the NIR curve displays a bimodal\nbehaviour, showing strong flares in the first part of the curve, and an almost\nflat trend in the rest. The X-ray curves show a few low/high mode transitions,\nbut no flaring activity. One of the low/high mode transition is found to happen\nat the same time as the emission of an infrared flare. This can be interpreted\nas the emission of a jet: the NIR flare could be due to the evolving spectrum\nof the jet, which possesses a break frequency that moves from higher (NIR) to\nlower (radio) frequencies after the launching, that has to happen at the\nlow/high mode transition. We also present the cross correlation function\nbetween the optical and near infrared curves. Due to the bimodality of the NIR\ncurve, we divided it in two parts (flaring and quiet). While the CCF of the\nquiet part is found to be flat, the one referring to the flaring part shows a\nnarrow peak at ~10s, which indicates a delay of the NIR emission with respect\nto the optical. This lag can be interpreted as reprocessing of the optical\nemission at the light cylinder radius with a stream of matter spiraling around\nthe system due to a phase of radio-ejection. This strongly supports a different\norigin of the NIR flares observed for PSR J1023+0038 with respect to the\noptical and X-ray flaring activity reported in other works on the same source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 20:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

While multicore platforms\nprovide incredible computational power and throughput, they also introduce new\nsources of unpredictability. Large fluctuations in latency to access data\nshared between multiple cores is an important contributor to the overall\nexecution-time variability. In addition to the temporal unpredictability\nintroduced by caching, parallel applications with data shared across multiple\ncores also pay additional latency overheads due to data coherence. Analyzing\nthe impact of data coherence on the worst-case execution-time of real-time\napplications is challenging because only scarce implementation details are\nrevealed by manufacturers. This paper presents application level control for\ncaching data at different levels of the cache hierarchy. The rationale is that\nby caching data only in shared cache it is possible to bypass private caches.\nThe access latency to data present in caches becomes independent of its\ncoherence state. We discuss the existing architectural support as well as the\nrequired hardware and OS modifications to support the proposed cacheability\ncontrol. We evaluate the system on an architectural simulator. We show that the\nworst case execution time for a single memory write request is reduced by 52%.\nBenchmark evaluations show that proposed technique has a minimal impact on\naverage performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 20:47:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Jun 2021 23:34:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

We prove that, far from being a peculiarity of those specific\nextensions and from requiring the convexity of the extended dynamics, this\ncriterium is valid provided the original family V of controls is abundant in\nthe extended family W. Abundance, which is stronger than the mere C^0-density\nof the original trajectories in the set of extended trajectories, is a\ndynamical-topological notion introduced by J. Warga, and is here utilized in a\n'non-convex' version which, moreover, is adapted to differential manifolds. To\nget the main result, which is based on set separation arguments, we prove an\nopen mapping result valid for Quasi-Differential-Quotient (QDQ) approximating\ncones, a notion of 'tangent cone' resulted as a peculiar specification of H.\nSussmann's Approximate-Generalized-Differential-Quotients (AGDQ) approximating\ncone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 21:44:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 10:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-24"}

The goal is to identify a task\nallocation strategy (i.e., decide when and where to collect sensing data) to\nachieve an optimized tradeoff between the data quality and the sensing cost.\nWhile recent progress has been made to tackle similar problems, three important\nchallenges have not been well addressed: (i) \"online task allocation\": the task\nallocation schemes need to respond quickly to the potentially large dynamics of\nthe measured variables in social sensing; (ii) \"multi-attribute constrained\noptimization\": minimizing the overall sensing error given the dependencies and\nconstraints of multiple attributes of the measured variables is a non-trivial\nproblem to solve; (iii) \"nonuniform task allocation cost\": the task allocation\ncost in social sensing often has a nonuniform distribution which adds\nadditional complexity to the optimized task allocation problem.

Previous EOS constructed for these elements used Thomas-Fermi (TF)\ntheory for the electronic behavior at high temperatures, which neglects\nelectronic shell structure; the atom-in-jellium EOS exhibited pronounced\nfeatures from the excitation of successive electron shells. Otherwise, the EOS\nmatched surprisingly well, especially considering the lack of experimental data\nfor Ru.

The\nmulti-ion calculations predicted that the hexagonal close-packed phase of Ru\nremains stable to at least 2.5 TPa and possibly 10 TPa, and that its c/a should\ngradually increase to the ideal value. A method was devised to estimate the\nvariation in Debye temperature from the cold curve, and thus estimate the\nion-thermal EOS without requiring relatively expensive dynamical force\ncalculations, in a form convenient for adjusting EOS or phase boundaries.

They argued that even though\none seemed to destroy the full covariance through the focus on a temporal\nfoliation of spacetime, this loss was illusory. Early on they convinced\nthemselves that only the construction of classical invariants could adequately\nreflect the fully relativistic absence of physical meaning of spacetime\ncoordinates. Efforts were made by Bergmann students Newman and Janis to\nconstruct these classical invariants. Then in the late 1950's Bergmann and\nKomar proposed a comprehensive program in which classical invariants could be\nconstructed using the spacetime geometry itself to fix intrinsic spacetime\nlandmarks. At roughly the same time Dirac formulated a new criterion for\nidentifying initial phase space variables, one of whose consequences was that\nBergmann himself abandoned the gravitational lapse and shift as canonical\nvariables. Furthermore, Bergmann in 1962 interpreted the Dirac formalism as\naltering the very nature of diffeomorphism symmetry. One class of infinitesimal\ndiffeomorphism was to be understood as depending on the perpendicular to the\ngiven temporal foliation. Thus even within the Bergmann school program the\npreservation of the full four-dimensional symmetry in the Hamiltonian program\nbecame problematic. Indeed, the ADM and associated Wheeler-DeWitt program that\ngained and has retained prominence since this time abandoned the full symmetry.\nThere do remain dissenters - raising the question whether the field of quantum\ngravity has witnessed a Renaissance in the ensuing decades - or might the full\nfour-dimensional symmetry yet be reborn?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 00:30:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 00:59:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}

While traditional Collaborative Filtering (CF) methods have\nmany advanced research works on exploring long-term dependency, which show\ngreat value to be explored and exploited in deep learning models. Therefore, in\nthis paper, we propose ASARS, a novel framework that effectively imports the\ntemporal dynamics methodology in CF into session-based RNN system in DL, such\nthat the temporal info can act as scalable weights by a parallel attentional\nnetwork. Specifically, we first conduct an extensive data analysis to show the\ndistribution and importance of such temporal interactions data both within\nsessions and across sessions.

We propose a new system based\non a tactile sensor GelSlim for the dense packing task. In this paper, we\npropose an insertion strategy that leverages tactile sensing to: 1) safely\nprobe the box with the grasped object while monitoring incipient slip to\nmaintain a stable grasp on the object. 2) estimate and correct for residual\nposition uncertainties to insert the object into a designated gap without\ndisturbing the environment.\n  Our proposed methodology is based on two neural networks that estimate the\nerror direction and error magnitude, from a stream of tactile imprints,\nacquired by two GelSlim fingers, during the insertion process. The system is\ntrained on four objects with basic geometric shapes, which we show generalizes\nto four other common objects. Based on the estimated positional errors, a\nheuristic controller iteratively adjusts the position of the object and\neventually inserts it successfully without requiring prior knowledge of the\ngeometry of the object. The key insight is that dense tactile feedback contains\nuseful information with respect to the contact interaction between the grasped\nobject and its environment. We achieve high success rate and show that unknown\nobjects can be inserted with an average of 6 attempts of the probe-correct\nloop. The method's ability to generalize to novel objects makes it a good fit\nfor box packing in warehouse automation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 01:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-13"}

First, RF\nsignals from any source are detected using a Markov models-based na\\\"ive Bayes\ndecision mechanism. When the receiver operates at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nof 10 dB, and the threshold, which defines the states of the models, is set at\na level 3.5 times the standard deviation of the preprocessed noise data, a\ndetection accuracy of 99.8% with a false alarm rate of 2.8% is achieved.\nSecond, signals from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth emitters, if present, are detected\nbased on the bandwidth and modulation features of the detected RF signal.

Fifteen statistical features extracted\nfrom the energy transients of the UAV controller signals are fed to\nneighborhood component analysis (NCA), and the three most significant features\nare selected.

Beyond linear autoregressive models, transfer and meta\nlearning address drift, but require data that is representative of disparate\ndomains at the outset of training. To relax this requirement, we propose a\nmemory-efficient \\emph{online} universal function approximator based on\ncompressed kernel methods. Our approach hinges upon viewing non-stationary\nlearning as online convex optimization with dynamic comparators, for which\nperformance is quantified by dynamic regret.\n  Prior works control dynamic regret growth only for linear models. In\ncontrast, we hypothesize actions belong to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces\n(RKHS).

Adding parallax, which results in the 3D Ken Burns effect, enables\nsignificantly more compelling results. Creating such effects manually is\ntime-consuming and demands sophisticated editing skills. Existing automatic\nmethods, however, require multiple input images from varying viewpoints. In\nthis paper, we introduce a framework that synthesizes the 3D Ken Burns effect\nfrom a single image, supporting both a fully automatic mode and an interactive\nmode with the user controlling the camera. Our framework first leverages a\ndepth prediction pipeline, which estimates scene depth that is suitable for\nview synthesis tasks. To address the limitations of existing depth estimation\nmethods such as geometric distortions, semantic distortions, and inaccurate\ndepth boundaries, we develop a semantic-aware neural network for depth\nprediction, couple its estimate with a segmentation-based depth adjustment\nprocess, and employ a refinement neural network that facilitates accurate depth\npredictions at object boundaries. According to this depth estimate, our\nframework then maps the input image to a point cloud and synthesizes the\nresulting video frames by rendering the point cloud from the corresponding\ncamera positions. To address disocclusions while maintaining geometrically and\ntemporally coherent synthesis results, we utilize context-aware color- and\ndepth-inpainting to fill in the missing information in the extreme views of the\ncamera path, thus extending the scene geometry of the point cloud. Experiments\nwith a wide variety of image content show that our method enables realistic\nsynthesis results. Our study demonstrates that our system allows users to\nachieve better results while requiring little effort compared to existing\nsolutions for the 3D Ken Burns effect creation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 06:55:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-13"}

In\naddition, uncertainty---originating from variation of parameters or unmodeled\nsystem dynamics---plays a key role in the system's stability.

The conditions for closed-loop\nstability and aperiodic transmission rule of feedback information are derived\nusing the discrete-time Input-to-State Stability theory.

While the black hole is essentially quiescent in the broader\ncontext of active galactic nuclei, X-ray observations have provided evidence\nfor energetic outbursts from its surroundings. Also, while the levels of star\nformation in the Galactic Centre have been approximately constant over the last\nfew hundred Myr, there is evidence of elevated short-duration bursts, strongly\ninfluenced by interaction of the black hole with the enhanced gas density\npresent within the ring-like Central Molecular Zone at Galactic longitude |l| <\n0.7 degrees and latitude |b| < 0.2 degrees. The inner 200 pc region is\ncharacterized by large amounts of warm molecular gas, a high cosmic ray\nionization rate, unusual gas chemistry, enhanced synchrotron emission, and a\nmultitude of radio-emitting magnetised filaments, the origin of which has not\nbeen established. Here we report radio imaging that reveals bipolar bubbles\nspanning 1 degree x 3 degrees (140 parsecs x 430 parsecs), extending above and\nbelow the Galactic plane and apparently associated with the Galactic Centre.\nThe structure is edge-brightened and bounded, with symmetry implying creation\nby an energetic event in the Galactic Centre. We estimate the age of the\nbubbles to be a few million years, with a total energy of 7 x 10^52 ergs. We\npostulate that the progenitor event was a major contributor to the increased\ncosmic-ray density in the Galactic Centre, and is in turn the principal source\nof the relativistic particles required to power the synchrotron emission of the\nradio filaments within and in the vicinity of the bubble cavities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 09:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-13"}

Firstly, we reproduce the\nknown CP asymmetry due to $K^0 -\\bar{K}^0$ mixing by means of the reciprocal\nbasis, which is convenient when a $K_{S(L)}$ is involved in the final state. As\nthe $K\\pi$ tensor form factor plays a crucial role in generating a non-zero\ndirect CP asymmetry that can arise only from the interference of vector and\ntensor operators, we then present a dispersive representation of this form\nfactor, with its phase obtained in the context of chiral theory with\nresonances, which fulfills the requirements of unitarity and analyticity.\nFinally, the $\\tau\\to K_S\\pi\\nu_\\tau$ decays are analyzed both within a\nmodel-independent low-energy effective theory framework and in a scalar\nleptoquark scenario. It is observed that the CP anomaly can be accommodated in\nthe model-independent framework, even at the $1\\sigma$ level, together with the\nconstraint from the branching ratio of $\\tau^-\\to K_S\\pi^-\\nu_\\tau$ decay; it\ncan be, however, marginally reconciled only at the $2\\sigma$ level, due to the\nspecific relation between the scalar and tensor operators in the scalar\nleptoquark scenario.

We carried out\ntwo studies to validate the expansion of the magnetic field with height. First,\nwe compare the photospheric Stokes V signals of two different spectral lines\nthat are sensitive to different optical depths (Ca I vs. Si I). The area at\nwhich the Stokes V signal is significantly large is almost three times larger\nfor the Si I line - sensitive to higher layers - than for the Ca I one. Second,\nthe inferred line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic fields at two optical depths (log tau\n= -1.0 vs. -2.5) from the Si I line reveal spatially broader fields in the\nhigher layer, up to 51% more extensive in one of the BPs. The dynamics of BPs\nare tracked along the Na I D2 and Si I lines. The inferred flows from Na I D2\nDoppler shifts are slow in BPs (< 1 km/s). The Si I line shows intriguing\nStokes profiles with important asymmetries. The analysis of these profiles\nunveils the presence of two components, a fast and a slow one, within the same\nresolution element. The faster one, with a smaller filling factor of 0.3,\nexhibits LOS velocities of about 6 km/s. The slower component is slightly\nblueshifted. The present work provides observational evidence for the expansion\nof the magnetic field with height. Moreover, fast flows are likely present in\nBPs but are often hidden because of observational limitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 10:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

The clinical effectiveness of primary prevention implantable\ncardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy is under debate.

The\nEUropean Comparative Effectiveness Research to Assess the Use of Primary\nProphylacTic Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (EU-CERT-ICD) completed in\n2019 will assess this issue.\n  SUMMARY. The EU-CERT-ICD is a prospective investigator-initiated\nnon-randomized, controlled, multicenter observational cohort study done in 44\ncenters across 15 European countries. A total of 2327 patients with heart\nfailure due to ischemic heart disease or dilated cardiomyopathy indicated for\nprimary prophylactic ICD implantation were recruited between 2014 and 2018\n(>1500 patients at first ICD implantation, >750 patients non-randomized non-ICD\ncontrol group). The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, first appropriate\nshock was co-primary endpoint. At baseline, all patients underwent 12-lead ECG\nand Holter-ECG analysis using multiple advanced methods for risk stratification\nas well as documentation of clinical characteristics and laboratory values. The\nEU-CERT-ICD data will provide much needed information on the survival benefit\nof preventive ICD therapy and expand on previous prospective risk\nstratification studies which showed very good applicability of clinical\nparameters and advanced risk stratifiers in order to define patient subgroups\nwith above or below average ICD benefit.\n  CONCLUSION. The EU-CERT-ICD study will provide new and current data about\neffectiveness of primary prophylactic ICD implantation. The study also aims for\nimproved risk stratification and patient selection using clinical risk markers\nin general, and advanced ECG risk markers in particular.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 11:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-13"}

The vast\nmajority of such objects are cm-sized, not catalogued and usually the tracking\ndata are not precise enough. Here we present the feasibility study of SD\ndetection and tracking with techniques usually employed in cosmic-ray physics.\nFor this purpose, we have evaluated the possibility of using Mini-EUSO, a\nspace-borne fluorescence telescope to be deployed on the ISS, to track SD\nilluminated by the Sun. By means of ESAF (EUSO Simulation and analysis\nFramework) simulation and by developing the trigger algorithms, we estimated\nthe minimum size and maximum distances of detectable SD. We then studied the\nnumber of possible SD detections using an ESA software called MASTER (Meteoroid\nand SD Terrestrial Environment Reference). With the Mini-EUSO Engineering Model\n(Mini-EUSO EM), we performed some measurements to estimate the reflectance of\nthe most common SD materials and to demonstrate the ability of Mini-EUSO to\ndetect SD events. We also performed some tests in open-sky conditions,\nidentifying and tracking fast-moving objects. In particular, the detection of a\nrocket body allowed us to confirm the simulation outcomes predictions and the\nexpected performance of the detector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 12:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-13"}

In this\ncontext, filtering the observations and tracking the network and environment\nstate over time is extremely important, and the Kalman Filter (KF) is one of\nthe most common tools for this. Several of these applications deal with\ncensored data, either because of sensor saturation or limited detection\nregions: when censoring happens, all measurements below a certain threshold are\nclipped to the threshold value. The recently proposed Tobit Kalman Filter (TKF)\nis an adjusted version of the KF that can deal with censored measurements.\nHowever, like the traditional KF, it needs full knowledge of the process and\nmeasurement noise covariances to work, which are not always available in\npractice. In this work, we relax this assumption and propose the Adaptive Tobit\nKalman Filter (ATKF), which can dynamically estimate the process and\nmeasurement noise along with the hidden state of the system from the censored\nmeasurements. We apply our solution to navigation and positioning IoT\nscenarios, obtaining a negligible performance loss with regard to the TKF, even\nwith no a priori knowledge of the noise statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 12:32:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-13"}

In this work, we determine the precision with which Gaia\ncan astrometrically measure the orbits and -- with additional observations --\nthe component masses, for luminous stars hosting hidden companions. Using\nrealistic mock Gaia observations, we find that Gaia can precisely measure the\norbits of binaries hosting hidden brown-dwarfs out to tens of pc and hidden\nwhite dwarf and neutron star companions at distances as far as several hundred\npc. Heavier black hole companions may be measured out to 1 kpc or farther.

Too early, and the decision\nbasis is too thin to classify a flow confidently; too late, and the tardy\nlabeling delays crucial actions (e.g., shutting down an attack) and invests\ncomputational resources for too long (e.g., tracking and storing features).\nMoreover, the optimal decision timing varies across flows.\n  We present pForest, a system for \"As Soon As Possible\" (ASAP) in-network\nclassification according to supervised machine learning models on top of\nprogrammable data planes. pForest automatically classifies each flow as soon as\nits label is sufficiently established, not sooner, not later. A key challenge\nbehind pForest is finding a strategy for dynamically adapting the features and\nthe classification logic during the lifetime of a flow. pForest solves this\nproblem by: (i) training random forest models tailored to different phases of a\nflow; and (ii) dynamically switching between these models in real time, on a\nper-packet basis. pForest models are tuned to fit the constraints of\nprogrammable switches (e.g., no floating points, no loops, and limited memory)\nwhile providing a high accuracy.\n  We implemented a prototype of pForest in Python (training) and P4\n(inference). Our evaluation shows that pForest can classify traffic ASAP for\nhundreds of thousands of flows, with a classification score that is on-par with\nsoftware-based solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 13:58:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2022 21:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-08"}

In human speech, short rising and falling\nFM-sweeps called formant transitions characterise individual speech sounds.\nThere are two representations of FM in the ascending auditory pathway: a\nspectral representation, holding the instantaneous frequency of the stimuli;\nand a sweep representation, consisting of neurons that respond selectively to\nFM direction. To-date computational models use feedforward mechanisms to\nexplain FM encoding. However, from neuroanatomy we know that there are massive\nfeedback projections in the auditory pathway. Here, we found that a classical\nFM-sweep perceptual effect, the sweep pitch shift, cannot be explained by\nstandard feedforward processing models. We hypothesised that the sweep pitch\nshift is caused by a predictive interaction between the sweep and the spectral\nrepresentation. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel model of FM\nencoding incorporating a predictive feedback mechanism. The model fully\naccounted for experimental data that we acquired in a perceptual experiment\nwith human participants as well as previously published experimental results.\nWe also designed a new family of stimuli for a second perceptual experiment to\nfurther validate the model.

Unfortunately, regularized friction introduces high-frequency stiff\ndynamics and even implicit methods struggle with these systems, especially\nduring slip-stick transitions.

Deriving good macroscopic\ndescriptions (the so-called \"closure problem\") is often a time-consuming\nprocess requiring deep understanding/intuition about the system of interest.\nRecent developments in data science provide alternative ways to effectively\nextract/learn accurate macroscopic descriptions approximating the underlying\nmicroscopic observations. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven framework\nfor the identification of unavailable coarse-scale PDEs from microscopic\nobservations via machine learning algorithms. Specifically, using Gaussian\nProcesses, Artificial Neural Networks, and/or Diffusion Maps, the proposed\nframework uncovers the relation between the relevant macroscopic space fields\nand their time evolution (the right-hand-side of the explicitly unavailable\nmacroscopic PDE). Interestingly, several choices equally representative of the\ndata can be discovered. The framework will be illustrated through the\ndata-driven discovery of macroscopic, concentration-level PDEs resulting from a\nfine-scale, Lattice Boltzmann level model of a reaction/transport process. Once\nthe coarse evolution law is identified, it can be simulated to produce\nlong-term macroscopic predictions. Different features (pros as well as cons) of\nalternative machine learning algorithms for performing this task (Gaussian\nProcesses and Artificial Neural Networks), are presented and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 14:21:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 18:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-11"}

The parameter eta can be shown to be\nproportional to the square root of the muon/proton mass ratio, so that it is\nsmall and the expansion is expected to converge. However, practical\nimplementations show that the eta convergence may be slower than expected. In\nthis work we probe the uncertainties due to this expansion using a different\nformalism, which is based on a multipole expansion of the longitudinal and\ntransverse response functions and was first introduced by Leidemann and\nRosenfelder. We refer to this alternative expansion as the eta-less formalism.\nWe generalize this formalism to account for the cancellation of elastic terms\nsuch as the third Zemach moment (or Friar moment) and embed it in a\ncomputationally efficient framework. We implement and test this approach in the\ncase of muonic deuterium. The comparison of results in the point nucleon limit\nfor both methods achieve sub-percent agreement. When nucleon form factors are\nintroduced we find a 4% and 2% difference in the third Zemach moment and\nnuclear polarizability, respectively, compared to the eta-less expansion,\nindicating that the nucleon form factor approximations should be improved.\nHowever, we find that the sum of these terms removes this dependence and the\nuncertainty due to the eta-expansion and the related second-order approximation\nin the nucleon form factors amounts only to 0.2% and thus is fully justified in\nmuonic deuterium. This computationally efficient framework paves the way to\nfurther studies in light muonic systems with more than two nucleons, where\ncontrolling and reducing uncertainties in nuclear structure corrections is key\nto the experimental efforts of the CREMA collaboration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 14:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-25"}

In this paper, we introduce InstructableCrowd, a\ncrowd-powered system that allows users to program their devices via\nconversation. The user verbally expresses a problem to the system, in which a\ngroup of crowd workers collectively respond and program relevant multi-part\nIF-THEN rules to help the user. The IF-THEN rules generated by\nInstructableCrowd connect relevant sensor combinations (e.g., location,\nweather, device acceleration, etc.) to useful effectors (e.g., text messages,\ndevice alarms, etc.). Our study showed that non-programmers can use the\nconversational interface of InstructableCrowd to create IF-THEN rules that have\nsimilar quality compared with the rules created manually. InstructableCrowd\ngenerally illustrates how users may converse with their devices, not only to\ntrigger simple voice commands, but also to personalize their increasingly\npowerful and complicated devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 14:43:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-13"}

Thus,\nintegrating affordance-based reasoning into symbolic action plannning pipelines\nwould enhance the flexibility of robot manipulation. Unfortunately, the top\nperforming affordance recognition methods use object category priors to boost\nthe accuracy of affordance detection and segmentation. Object priors limit\ngeneralization to unknown object categories. This paper describes an affordance\nrecognition pipeline based on a category-agnostic region proposal network for\nproposing instance regions of an image across categories. To guide affordance\nlearning in the absence of category priors, the training process includes the\nauxiliary task of explicitly inferencing existing affordances within a\nproposal. Secondly, a self-attention mechanism trained to interpret each\nproposal learns to capture rich contextual dependencies through the region.\nVisual benchmarking shows that the trained network, called AffContext, reduces\nthe performance gap between object-agnostic and object-informed affordance\nrecognition. AffContext is linked to the Planning Domain Definition Language\n(PDDL) with an augmented state keeper for action planning across temporally\nspaced goal-oriented tasks. Manipulation experiments show that AffContext can\nsuccessfully parse scene content to seed a symbolic planner problem\nspecification, whose execution completes the target task. Additionally,\ntask-oriented grasping for cutting and pounding actions demonstrate the\nexploitation of multiple affordances for a given object to complete specified\ntasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:58:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2020 22:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

Quantum supremacy\nis the event at which the old Extended Church-Turing Thesis is overturned: A\nquantum computer performs a task that is practically impossible for any\nclassical (super)computer. The demonstration requires both a solid theoretical\nguarantee and an experimental realization. The lead candidate is Random Circuit\nSampling (RCS), which is the task of sampling from the output distribution of\nrandom quantum circuits.

The robustness to the estimation error that we prove may serve as a\nnew hardness criterion for the performance of classical algorithms.

The mathematical formulation of the proposed filter\nis based on the construction of an optimal nonlinear map between the observable\nand parameter (state) spaces via a convergent sequence of linear maps obtained\nby successive linearisation of the observation operator in a Gauss-Newton-like\nform. To allow automatic linearisation of the dynamical system in a sparse\nform, the smoother is designed in a hierarchical setting such that the forward\nmap and its linearised counterpart are estimated in a Bayesian manner given a\nforecasted data set. To improve the algorithm convergence, the smoother is\nfurther reformulated in its incremental form in which the current and\nintermediate states are assimilated before the initial one, and the\ncorresponding posterior estimates are taken as pseudo-measurements. As the\nlatter ones are random variables, and not deterministic any more, the novel\nstochastic iterative filter is designed to take this into account. To correct\nthe bias in the posterior outcome, the procedure is built in a\npredictor-corrector form in which the predictor phase is used to assimilate\nnoisy measurement data, whereas the corrector phase is constructed to correct\nthe mean bias. The resulting filter is further discretised via time-adapting\nsparse polynomial chaos expansions obtained either via modified Gram-Schmidt\northogonalisation or by a carefully chosen nonlinear mapping, both of which are\nestimated in a Bayesian manner by promoting the sparsity of the outcomes. The\ntime adaptive basis with non-Gaussian arguments is further mapped to the\npolynomial chaos one by a suitably chosen isoprobabilistic transformation.\nFinally, the proposed method is tested on a chaotic nonlinear Lorenz 1984\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 11:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}

The control variables are the dates and rates of\nthinning and the cutting age.The risk model is based on a Poisson processus.\nThe Faustmann approach, including tree damage risk, is used to evaluate future\nbenefits, economic or ecosystem services. It relies on the calculation of\nexpected values, for which a dedicated mathematical development has been done.\nThe optimized criteria used to evaluate the various scenarii are the Faustmann\nvalue and the Averaged yield value.We illustrate the approach and the software\non two case studies: economic optimization of a beech stand and carbon\nsequestration optimization of a pine stand.Software interface makes it easy for\nusers to write their own (growth-tree damage-economic) models without advanced\nprogramming skills. The possibility to run management scenarii with/without\nconsidering the impact of natural risk may contribute improving silviculture\nguidelines and adapting them to climate change. We propose future lines of\nresearch and improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 11:12:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}

These VEVs yield zero vacuum\nenergy for the Higgs potential, even after gauge symmetry breaking (`GSB').\nNothing like this happens in theories without SUSY. However, there are four\nproblems that make this initially promising feature look quite useless and\nineffective: (1) SUSY has too many Higgs Fields. (2) SUSY predicts\nsupermultiplets. (3) Spontaneous breaking of SUSY looks contrived and it is\nunsuccessful anyway (because of the sum rules and the huge auxiliary VEVs). (4)\nThere are negative terms in the supergravity version of the Higgs potential.\nThese problems are normally considered to be an inevitable consequence of SUSY.\nHowever, using a technique we call suppression of fields (or `flipping'), we\ncan remove all four problems, without disturbing the basic algebra of SUSY.\n  We start with a conventional Grand Unified Supergravity Theory (`GUST'), and\nits BRST Master Equation. The BRST Master Equation treats fields and Zinn\nsources more or less like coordinates and momenta in the Classical Poisson\nBracket, and that suggests exchanging the fields and the Zinn sources, as in a\ncanonical transfomation. We call this flipping. The resulting new `suppressed'\nGUST has a simple quadratic Higgs potential, and so it has a naturally zero\ncosmological constant after GSB (at tree level). It also has a Master Equation,\nsimply derived from the original GUST, that preserves its symmetry, and its\nunitarity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 14:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

Firstly, inspired by the state-of-art simplifications on the\nthird-order HGKS, we extend the HGKS to the case of arbitrary high-order\naccuracy and eliminate its unnecessary high-order dissipation terms. Secondly,\ninstead of computing the derivatives of particle distribution function and\ntheir complex moments, we introduce a Lax-Wendroff procedure to compute the\nhigh-order derivatives of macroscopic quantities directly. The new scheme takes\nadvantage of both HGKS and the Lax-Wendroff procedure, so that it can be easily\nextended to the case of arbitrary high-order accuracy with practical\nsignificance. Typical numerical tests are carried out by EHGKS, with the third,\nfifth and seventh-order accuracy. The presence of good resolution on the\ndiscontinuities and flow details, together with the optimal CFL numbers,\nvalidates the high accuracy and strong robustness of EHGKS. To compare the\nefficiency, we present the results computed by the EHGKS, the original HGKS and\nRunge-Kutta-WENO-GKS.

Refinement was added through adjusting radial dose\nintegration upper limit which gives the effective delta-ray range, rmax and\nions penumbra radius in water as well. Radial dose distributions for 85 ions\nforming fifteen energy groups from 0.25 to 24 MeV/n were studied. By employing\nthe effective delta-ray range, it was possible to get more consistent radial\ndose distribution in comparison to experimental and Monte Carlo simulation\ndata. The corresponding LET values of those ions were estimated and compared\nwith SRIM program. Penumbra radii for 85 ions were determined. Good description\nfor the penumbra radii was obtained using a proposed new equation which fits\nexperimental data as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 10:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-26"}

We attempt to find input\nimages for which the output of a black-box denoiser is proportional to the\ninput. We treat this as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. This has potentially\nwide implications, since most image processing algorithms can be viewed as\ngeneric nonlinear operators. We introduce a generalized nonlinear power-method\nto solve eigenproblems for such black-box operators. Using this method we\nreveal stable modes of nonlinear denoisers. These modes are optimal inputs for\nthe denoiser, achieving superior PSNR in noise removal. Analogously to the\nlinear case (low-pass-filter), such stable modes are eigenfunctions\ncorresponding to large eigenvalues, characterized by large piece-wise-smooth\nstructures. We also provide a method to generate the complementary, most\nunstable modes, which the denoiser suppresses strongly. These modes are\ntextures with small eigenvalues. We validate the method using total-variation\n(TV) and demonstrate it on the EPLL denoiser (Zoran-Weiss).
