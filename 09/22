Traditionally, researchers have relied on Elo ratings for\nthis purpose, with recent works also using methods based on Nash equilibria.\nUnfortunately, Elo is unable to handle intransitive agent interactions, and\nother techniques are restricted to zero-sum, two-player settings or are limited\nby the fact that the Nash equilibrium is intractable to compute. Recently, a\nranking method called {\\alpha}-Rank, relying on a new graph-based\ngame-theoretic solution concept, was shown to tractably apply to general games.\nHowever, evaluations based on Elo or {\\alpha}-Rank typically assume noise-free\ngame outcomes, despite the data often being collected from noisy simulations,\nmaking this assumption unrealistic in practice. This paper investigates\nmultiagent evaluation in the incomplete information regime, involving\ngeneral-sum many-player games with noisy outcomes. We derive sample complexity\nguarantees required to confidently rank agents in this setting. We propose\nadaptive algorithms for accurate ranking, provide correctness and sample\ncomplexity guarantees, then introduce a means of connecting uncertainties in\nnoisy match outcomes to uncertainties in rankings. We evaluate the performance\nof these approaches in several domains, including Bernoulli games, a soccer\nmeta-game, and Kuhn poker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Sep 2019 16:05:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:21:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 10:05:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 09:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-13"}

Separating all-digital\nbeamforming into analog and digital stages can provide the large reduction in\npower consumption and small loss in spectral efficiency needed for practical\nimplementations. Developing algorithms with this favorable tradeoff is\nchallenging due to the additional degrees of freedom in the analog stage and\nits accompanying hardware constraints. In hybrid beamforming systems, for\nexample, channel estimation algorithms do not directly observe the channels,\nface a high channel count, and operate at low SNR before transmit-receive beam\nalignment. Since mmWave channels are sparse in time and beam domains, many\ncompressed sensing (CS) channel estimation algorithms have been developed that\nrandomly configure the analog beamformers, digital beamformers, and/or pilot\nsymbols. In this paper, we propose to design deterministic beamformers and\npilot symbols for open-loop channel estimation.

We investigate the attention weights a state of the\nart RTE method assigns to input tokens in the RTE component of fact\nverification systems, and confirm that most of the weight is assigned to POS\ntags of nouns (e.g., NN, NNP etc.) or their phrases. To verify that these\nlexicalized models transfer poorly, we implement a domain transfer experiment\nwhere a RTE component is trained on the FEVER data, and tested on the Fake News\nChallenge (FNC) dataset.

The key idea is to use a\nHebbian network with bio-inspired neural traces in order to bridge temporal\ndelays between actions and rewards when confounding observations and sparse\nrewards result in inaccurate TD errors. In MOHQA, DQN learns low level features\nand control, while the MOHN contributes to the high-level decisions by\nassociating rewards with past states and actions. Thus the proposed\narchitecture combines two modules with significantly different learning\nalgorithms, a Hebbian associative network and a classical DQN pipeline,\nexploiting the advantages of both. Simulations on a set of POMDPs and on the\nMALMO environment show that the proposed algorithm improved DQN's results and\neven outperformed control tests with A2C, QRDQN+LSTM and REINFORCE algorithms\non some POMDPs with confounding stimuli and sparse rewards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Sep 2019 21:32:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 14:05:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 14:29:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 20:42:17 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 07:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-15"}

In the past few decades, EMG signals have been used\nextensively in the identification of user intention to potentially control\nassistive devices such as smart wheelchairs, exoskeletons, and prosthetic\ndevices. In the design of conventional assistive devices, developers optimize\nmultiple subsystems independently. Feature extraction and feature description\nare essential subsystems of this approach. Therefore, researchers proposed\nvarious hand-crafted features to interpret EMG signals. However, the\nperformance of conventional assistive devices is still unsatisfactory. In this\npaper, we propose a deep learning approach to control prosthetic hands with raw\nEMG signals. We use a novel deep convolutional neural network to eschew the\nfeature-engineering step. Removing the feature extraction and feature\ndescription is an important step toward the paradigm of end-to-end\noptimization. Fine-tuning and personalization are additional advantages of our\napproach. The proposed approach is implemented in Python with TensorFlow deep\nlearning library, and it runs in real-time in general-purpose graphics\nprocessing units of NVIDIA Jetson TX2 developer kit. Our results demonstrate\nthe ability of our system to predict fingers position from raw EMG signals. We\nanticipate our EMG-based control system to be a starting point to design more\nsophisticated prosthetic hands.

In\norder to achieve continuously optimal engine operation, engine calibration\nmethods use a combination of static correlations obtained from dynamometer\ntests for steady-state operating points and road and/or track performance data.\nAs the parameter space of control variables, design variable constraints, and\nobjective functions increases, the cost and duration for optimal calibration\nbecome prohibitively large. In order to reduce the number of dynamometer tests\nrequired for calibrating modern engines, a large-scale simulation-driven\nmachine learning approach is presented in this work. A parallel, fast, robust,\nphysics-based reduced-order engine simulator is used to obtain performance and\nemission characteristics of engines over a wide range of control parameters\nunder various transient driving conditions (drive cycles). We scale the\nsimulation up to 3,906 nodes of the Theta supercomputer at the Argonne\nLeadership Computing Facility to generate data required to train a machine\nlearning model.

Once\ntrained, the deep-neural-network-based surrogate model is fast for inference:\nit requires about 16 micro sec for predicting the engine performance and\nemissions for a single design configuration compared with about 0.5 s per\nconfiguration with the engine simulator. Moreover, we demonstrate that transfer\nlearning and retraining can be leveraged to incrementally retrain the surrogate\nmodel to cope with new configurations that fall outside the training data\nspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Sep 2019 01:58:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

To address this issue, we propose\nHAWKEYE, which is a separate neural network that analyzes the output layer of\nthe DNN, and detects AEs. HAWKEYE's AE detector utilizes a quantized version of\nan input image as a reference, and is trained to distinguish the variation\ncharacteristics of the DNN output on an input image from the DNN output on its\nreference image. We also show that cascading our AE detectors that are trained\nfor different quantization step sizes can drastically reduce a false positive\nrate, while keeping a detection rate high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Sep 2019 04:19:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

That\nsuggests that the spatial nonlocal interactions cannot be ruled out of the\nturbulence physics. Furthermore, filtering the Navier-Stokes equations in the\nlarge eddy simulation of turbulent flows would further enhance the existing\nnonlocality, emerging in the corresponding subgrid scale fluid motions. That\nurges the development of new nonlocal closure models, which respect the\ncorresponding non-Gaussian statistics of the subgrid stochastic motions. To\nthis end and starting from the filtered Boltzmann equation, we model the\ncorresponding equilibrium distribution function with a \\textit{L\\'evy}-stable\ndistribution, leading to the proposed fractional-order modeling of\nsubgrid-scale stresses. We approximate the filtered equilibrium distribution\nfunction with a power-law term, and derive the corresponding filtered\nNavier-Stokes equations.

In\nthis paper, we introduce novel semantic features of an image based on the\nannotations and descriptions of its similar images available on the web.\nSpecifically, we propose a new method which consists of two consecutive steps\nto extract our semantic features.

We evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed features in scene image classification on three\ncommonly-used scene image datasets (i.e., MIT-67, Scene15 and Event8).

In this research, we try\nto cut the unnecessary long tail in the clustering process to achieve a\nsufficiently satisfactory accuracy at the lowest possible computation cost. A\nnovel approach is proposed to achieve cost-effective big data clustering in the\ncloud.

To illustrate the robustness and versatility of our method, we\nshow examples in the Rayleigh, Mie, and geometrical optics scattering regimes.\nGiven the symmetry between the electric field and the magnetic field, our\ntheoretical framework can also be used to solve for the magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Sep 2019 14:20:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

However, neural networks are\ncomplex black-box models, which hinders humans from interpreting and\nconsequently trusting them in making critical decisions. Towards interpreting\nneural networks, several approaches have been proposed to extract simple\ndeterministic models from neural networks. The results are not encouraging\n(e.g., low accuracy and limited scalability), fundamentally due to the limited\nexpressiveness of such simple models.\n  In this work, we propose an approach to extract probabilistic automata for\ninterpreting an important class of neural networks, i.e., recurrent neural\nnetworks.

Thereafter, it is shown\nthat even if new deductions have poles at s=q, their differences at the same\nare convergent. Further some special cases are given for particular values of\nthe Zeta functions. Lastly, certain open problems are provided which might be\nhelpful for further advancements in the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Sep 2019 13:20:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 19:42:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 13:38:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 2021 17:17:02 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 12 Dec 2021 12:22:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}
