This theoretical paper investigates the\nthermoelectric properties of n-type rutile TiO$_2$, which is the most stable\nphase of titanium oxide up to 2000 K. The electronic structure is obtained\nthrough ab initio calculations, while the prominent features of strong\nelectron-phonon interaction and defects states are modelled using a small\nnumber of parameters. The theoretical results are compared with a wealth of\nexperimental data from the literature, yielding very good agreements over a\nwide range of carrier concentrations. This validates the hypothesis of band\nconduction in rutile TiO$_2$ and allows the prediction of the high-temperature\nthermoelectric properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 16:22:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 2019 21:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

We begin by decomposing the full-order, nonlinear and\nhybrid dynamics of a three-dimensional quadrupedal robot, including its\ncontinuous and discrete dynamics, into two bipedal systems that are subject to\nexternal forces. Using the hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) framework, gaits for\nthese bipedal robots can be rapidly generated (on the order of seconds) along\nwith corresponding controllers. The decomposition is achieved in such a way\nthat the bipedal walking gaits and controllers can be composed to yield dynamic\nwalking gaits for the original quadrupedal robot --- the result is the rapid\ngeneration of dynamic quadruped gaits utilizing the full-order dynamics.

Before a black hole binary relaxes to a final\nstate, it undergoes damped oscillations which completely characterize the final\nobject. These oscillations are described by quasinormal modes which are present\nin many dissipative systems. Quasinormal modes are linked to the way a black\nhole spacetime responds to small fluctuations. Although the field equations\nadmit a well defined future evolution of spacetime, some black holes, like the\nones formed after a binary merger, possess a boundary, beyond which the field\nequations lose their predictive power. This boundary is called a Cauchy horizon\nand designates the region beyond which the spacetime can potentially be\ndescribed in a highly non-unique manner.\n  Strong cosmic censorship states that, generically, suitable initial data\nshould be future inextendible beyond the Cauchy horizon, as a solution to the\nfield equations. Recent studies indicate that the fate of Cauchy horizons, such\nas those found inside charged and rotating cosmological black holes, is\nintrinsically connected to the decay of perturbations exterior to the event\nhorizon. As such, the validity of strong cosmic censorship is tied to how\neffectively the exterior damps fluctuations.

The metric of\nimportance is defined as the relative decrease of the initial accuracy when all\ncorrelations related to a certain feature is vanished. In general, the broad\nphotometric bands presented higher importance when compared to narrow ones. The\ninfluence of the morphological parameters has been evaluated training the RF\nwith and without the inclusion of morphological parameters, presenting accuracy\nvalues of 95.0\\% and 88.1\\%, respectively.

The morphology can notably improve the classification of objects at\nregions in the diagram where the misclassification was relatively high.\nConsequently, it provides cleaner samples for statistical studies. The expected\ncontamination rate of red galaxies as a function of the redshift is estimated,\nproviding corrections for red galaxy samples.

From a model-building perspective, the\nscattering of sub-GeV dark matter on nucleons essentially must proceed via new\nlight mediator particles, given that collider searches place extremely\nstringent bounds on contact-type interactions. Here we present an updated\ncompilation of relevant limits for the case of a scalar mediator, including a\nnew estimate of the near-future sensitivity of the NA62 experiment as well as a\ndetailed evaluation of the model-specific limits from Big Bang nucleosynthesis.\nWe also derive updated and more general limits on DM particles upscattered by\ncosmic rays, applicable to arbitrary energy- and momentum dependences of the\nscattering cross section.

However, the preparation of non-classical quantum states in such\natom-waveguide interfaces has not yet been realized.

For multi-cell\nscenarios, a so-called load-coupling model has been proposed to characterize\nthe presence of mutual interference for NOMA, and resource optimization relies\non the use of fixed-point iterations [1], [2] across cells. One difficulty here\nis that the order of decoding for successive interference cancellation (SIC) in\nNOMA is generally not known a priori. This is because the decoding order in one\ncell depends on interference, which, in turn, is governed by resource\nallocation in other cells, and vice versa. To achieve convergence, previous\nworks have used workarounds that pose restrictions to NOMA, such that the SIC\ndecoding order remains in optimization. As a comment to [1], [2], we derive and\nprove the following result: The convergence is guaranteed, even if the order\nchanges over the iterations. The result not only waives the need of previous\nworkarounds, but also implies that a wide class of resource optimization\nproblems for multi-cell NOMA is tractable, as long as that for single cell is.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 18:10:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 22:12:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 12:49:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 19:59:28 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 19:11:46 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2020 20:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

There is broad agreement\nin the literature that the effect should be present for theoretical reasons,\nand it has been consistently found in empirical work. However, a few papers\nhave pointed out a puzzle: the return distributions of many assets do not\nappear to be affected by the leverage effect. We analyze the determinants of\nthe return distribution and find that the impact of the leverage effect comes\nprimarily from an interaction between the leverage effect and the\nmean-reversion effect. When the leverage effect is large and the mean-reversion\neffect is small, then the interaction exerts a strong effect on the return\ndistribution. However, if the mean-reversion effect is large, even a large\nleverage effect has little effect on the return distribution. To better\nunderstand the impact of the interaction effect, we propose an indirect method\nto measure it. We apply our methodology to empirical data and find that the S&P\n500 data exhibits a weak interaction effect, and consequently its returns\ndistribution is little impacted by the leverage effect. Furthermore, the\ninteraction effect is closely related to the size factor: small firms tend to\nhave a strong interaction effect and large firms tend to have a weak\ninteraction effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 19:01:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 17:14:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

However only an upper limit was placed on the planet mass (<1.3\nMj), and a highly uncertain planetary radius (0.7-1.7 Rj) was determined. We\naim to better characterise both the star and the planet and precisely measure\ntheir orbital and physical parameters. In order to constrain the mass of the\nplanet, we obtained new measurements of the radial velocity of the star and\njoined them with those from the discovery paper. Photometric data from the\nHATSouth survey and new multi-band, high-quality (precision reached up to\n0.37~mmag) photometric follow-up observations of transit events were acquired\nand analysed for getting accurate photometric parameters. We fit the model to\nall the observations, including data from the TESS space telescope, in two\ndifferent modes: incorporating the stellar isochrones into the fit, and using\nan empirical method to get the stellar parameters. The two modes resulted to be\nconsistent with each other to within 2 sigma. We confirm the grazing nature of\nthe WASP-174b transits with a confidence level greater than 5 sigma, which is\nalso corroborated by simultaneously observing the transit through four optical\nbands and noting how the transit depth changes due to the limb-darkening\neffect. We estimate that ~76% of the disk of the planet actually eclipses the\nparent star at mid-transit of its transit events. We find that WASP-174b is a\nhighly-inflated hot giant planet with a mass of 0.330 Mj and a radius of 1.435\nRj, and is therefore a good target for transmission-spectroscopy observations.\nWith a density of 0.135 g/cm^3, it is amongst the lowest-density planets ever\ndiscovered with precisely measured mass and radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-14"}

This theory is based on the plausible\nhypothesis that mode penetration at the top of the pedestal is a necessary and\nsufficient condition for the RMP-induced suppression of ELMs. The theory also\nmakes use of a number of key insights gained in a recent publication\n(Fitzpatrick R 2019). The first insight is that the response of the plasma to a\nparticular helical component of the RMP, in the immediate vicinity of the\nassociated resonant surface, is governed by nonlinear magnetic island physics,\nrather than by linear layer physics. The second insight is that neoclassical\neffects play a vital role in the physics of RMP-induced ELM suppression. The\nfinal insight is that plasma impurities play an important role in the physics\nof RMP-induced ELM suppression. The theory presented in this paper is employed\nto gain a better understanding ELM suppression in DIII-D and ITER H-mode\ndischarges. It is found that ELM suppression is only possible when q_95 takes\nvalues that lie in certain narrow windows. Moreover, the widths of these\nwindows decrease with increasing plasma density. Assuming a core plasma\nrotation of 20 krad/s, the window width for a model ITER H-mode discharge is\nfound to be similar to, but slightly smaller than, the window width in a\ntypical DIII-D H-mode discharge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 20:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-20"}

Properties of social systems can be explained by the\ninterplay and weaving of individual actions. Incentives are key to understand\npeople's choices and decisions. For instance, individual preferences of where\nto live may lead to the emergence of social segregation. In this paper, we\ncombine Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Agent Based Models (ABM) in order to\naddress the self-organizing dynamics of social segregation and explore the\nspace of possibilities that emerge from considering different types of\nincentives. Our model promotes the creation of interdependencies and\ninteractions among multiple agents of two different kinds that want to\nsegregate from each other. For this purpose, agents use Deep Q-Networks to make\ndecisions based on the rules of the Schelling Segregation model and the\nPredator-Prey model. Despite the segregation incentive, our experiments show\nthat spatial integration can be achieved by establishing interdependencies\namong agents of different kinds. They also reveal that segregated areas are\nmore probable to host older people than diverse areas, which attract younger\nones.

A key consensus problem in blockchains is that of\ndetermining the next block (data element) in the sequence. Many blockchains\naddress this by electing a new node to propose each new block. The new block is\n(typically) appended to the tip of the proposer's local blockchain, and\nsubsequently broadcast to the rest of the network. Without network delay (or\nadversarial behavior), this procedure would give a perfect chain, since each\nproposer would have the same view of the blockchain. A major challenge in\npractice is forking. Due to network delays, a proposer may not yet have the\nmost recent block, and may, therefore, create a side chain that branches from\nthe middle of the main chain. Forking reduces throughput, since only one a\nsingle main chain can survive, and all other blocks are discarded. We propose a\nnew P2P protocol for blockchains called Barracuda, in which each proposer,\nprior to proposing a block, polls $\\ell$ other nodes for their local blocktree\ninformation.

Some have concluded that sorption increases\nmean solute transport velocity and decreases dispersion relative to a tracer,\nwhile others have concluded the opposite. Here we resolve this contradiction by\nderiving a series solution for the transient evolution that recovers previous\nresults in the appropriate limits. This solution shows a transition in solute\ntransport behavior from early to late time that is captured by the first- and\nzeroth-order terms. Mean solute transport velocity is increased at early times\nand reduced at late times, while solute dispersion is initially reduced, but\nshows a complex dependence on the partition coefficient $k$ at late times. In\nthe equilibrium sorption model, the time scale of the early regime and the\nduration of the transition to the late regime both increase with $\\text{ln} k$\nfor large $k$. The early regime is pronounced in strongly-sorbing systems\n($k\\gg 1$). The kinetic sorption model shows a similar transition from the\nearly to the late transport regime and recovers the equilibrium results when\nadsorption and desorption rates are large. As the reaction rates slow down, the\nduration of the early regime increases, but the changes in transport velocity\nand dispersion relative to a tracer diminish. In general, if the partition\ncoefficient $k$ is large, the early regime is well-developed and the behavior\nis well characterized by the analysis of the limiting case without desorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 21:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-20"}

The\ndiscretization of these PDEs typically proceeds by either parametrizing the\nsurface, triangulating the surface, or embedding the surface in a higher\ndimensional flat space. The closest point method (CPM) is an embedding method\nthat represents surfaces using a function that maps points in the embedding\nspace to their closest points on the surface. In the CPM, this mapping also\nserves as an extension operator that brings surface intrinsic data onto the\nembedding space, allowing PDEs to be numerically approximated by standard\nmethods in a narrow tubular neighborhood of the surface.

Sparse non-Hermitian random matrices\narise naturally in this context, and are key to describing statistical\nproperties of the non-equilibrium dynamics that emerges from interactions\nwithin the network structure. Here, we study one-dimensional (1d) spatial\nstructures and focus on sparse non-Hermitian random matrices in the spirit of\ntight-binding models in solid state physics. We first investigate two-point\neigenvalue correlations in the complex plane for sparse non-Hermitian random\nmatrices using methods developed for the statistical mechanics of inhomogeneous\n2d interacting particles. We find that eigenvalue repulsion in the complex\nplane directly correlates with eigenvector delocalization. In addition, for 1d\nchains and rings with both disordered nearest neighbor connections and\nself-interactions, the self-interaction disorder tends to de-correlate\neigenvalues and localize eigenvectors more than simple hopping disorder.\nHowever, remarkable resistance to eigenvector localization by disorder is\nprovided by large cycles, such as those embodied in 1d periodic boundary\nconditions under strong directional bias. The directional bias also spatially\nseparates the left and right eigenvectors, leading to interesting dynamics in\nexcitation and response.

Because the rate of release\ndetermines the operation time of the bearing, we study this release process by\nmeasuring the amount of extracted oil as a function of time, while we use\nabsorbing paper, to speed up the process. The oil concentration in the\nresulting stain is determined by measuring the attenuation of light transmitted\nthrough the paper, using a modified Lambert-Beer law. For grease the timescale\nfor paper imbibition is typically 2 orders of magnitude larger than for a bare\ndrop of the same base oil. This difference results from the high affinity, \\it\ni.e. wetting energy per unit volume, of the oil for the grease matrix. To\nquantify this affinity, we developed a Washburn-like model describing the oil\nflow from the porous grease into the paper pores. The stain radius versus time\ncurves for greases at various levels of oil content collapse onto a single\nmaster curve, which allows us to extract a characteristic spreading time and\nthe corresponding oil-matrix affinity.

Most of the models for\nthese applications are non-convex and always involve some conflicting\nobjectives. The mathematical and heuristic methods have their advantages in\nsolving this category of problems. In this work, we turn to Multi-Objective\nEvolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) for finding elegant solutions for such\nproblems. In this framework, we investigate a multi-objective constrained\nportfolio optimization problem, which can be cast as a classical financial\nproblem and can also be naturally modeled as an MINLP problem. Consequently, we\npoint out one challenge, faced by a direct coding scheme for MOEAs, to this\nproblem.

The signal will be contaminated due\nto absorption, the largest component of which will be the flux absorbed by the\nHI emitting sources themselves from the flux incident on them from background\nradio continuum sources. We, for the first time, provide a quantitative\nestimate of the magnitude of the absorbed flux compared to the emitted HI flux\nfor various voxels placed at redshifts between 0.1 and 2.5. We use a\ncosmological sky simulation of the atomic HI emission line, and sum over the\nemitted and absorbed fluxes for all sources within voxels at different\nredshifts. For estimating the absorbed flux we use various relations based on\nexisting observations as well as simulations. We find that for the same\nco-moving volume of sky, the HI emission falls off quickly with increasing\nredshift, while the absorption varies much less with redshift and follows the\nredshift distribution of faint sources that dominate the number counts of radio\ncontinuum sources. This results in the fraction of absorption compared to\nemission to be negligible in the nearby Universe (up to a redshift of ~0.5),\nincreases to about 10% at a redshift of 1, and continues to increase to about\n30% up to a redshift of 2.5. These numbers can vary significantly due to the\nuncertainties on the exact forms of the various relations used, the largest\nvariation being driven by the uncertainty on the number counts of radio\ncontinuum sources at sub-mJy flux densities. Absorption of flux incident from\nbackground radio continuum sources might become an important contaminant to HI\nIM signals beyond redshifts of 0.5, and needs to be quantified more accurately\nusing inputs from upcoming deep high resolution surveys of radio continuum\nsources, HI absorption, and HI emission with the SKA and its precursors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 01:16:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 16:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

The flux of type III radio burst has a time profile of rising and\ndecay phase at a given frequency, which has been actively studied since 1970s.\nSeveral factors that may influence the duration of a type III radio burst has\nbeen proposed. However, the major cause of the duration is still an open\nquestion. In this work, to study the dominant cause of the duration, we\ninvestigate the source positions of the front edge, the peak, and the tail edge\nin the dynamic spectrum of a single and clear type III radio burst. The\nduration of this type III burst at a given frequency is about 3 second for\ndecameter wave. The beam-formed observations by the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR)\nare used, which can provide the radio source positions and the dynamic spectra\nat the same time. We find that, for this burst, the source positions of the\nfront edge, the peak, and the tail edge split with each other spatially. The\nradial speed of the front edge, the peak, and the tail edge is 0.42 c, 0.25 c,\nand 0.16 c, respectively. We estimate the influences of the corona density\nfluctuation and the electron-velocity dispersion on the duration, and the\nscattering effect by comparison with a few short-duration bursts from the same\nregion. The analysis yields that, in the frequency range of 30 - 41 MHz, the\nelectron-velocity dispersion is the dominant factor that determines the time\nduration of type III radio bursts with long duration, while scattering may play\nimportant role in the duration of short bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 02:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

To capture detailed structures of the energy distribution in the\nwave-number space, it is indispensable to examine the energy distribution with\nnon-integrated spectra by fixing the codimensional wave-number component or in\nthe two-dimensional domain spanned by both the horizontal and vertical wave\nnumbers. Indices which separate the range of the anisotropic weak-wave\nturbulence in the wave-number space are proposed based on the decomposed\nenergies. In addition, the dominance of the waves in the range is also verified\nby the small frequency deviation from the linear dispersion relation. In the\nwave-dominant range, the linear wave periods given by the linear dispersion\nrelation are smaller than approximately one third of the eddy-turnover time.\nThe linear wave periods reflect the anisotropy of the system, while the\nisotropic Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a period is used to evaluate the Ozmidov wave\nnumber, which is necessarily isotropic.

But according to rationalist\nmodels of natural language communication, the collective salience of each\nentity will be expressed not only in how often it is mentioned, but in the form\nthat those mentions take. This is because natural language communication is\npremised on (and customized to) the expectations that speakers and writers have\nabout how their messages will be interpreted by the intended audience. We test\nthis idea by conducting a large-scale analysis of public online discussions of\nbreaking news events on Facebook and Twitter, focusing on five recent crisis\nevents. We examine how people refer to locations, focusing specifically on\ncontextual descriptors, such as \"San Juan\" versus \"San Juan, Puerto Rico.\"\nRationalist accounts of natural language communication predict that such\ndescriptors will be unnecessary (and therefore omitted) when the named entity\nis expected to have high prior salience to the reader. We find that the use of\ncontextual descriptors is indeed associated with proxies for social and\ninformational expectations, including macro-level factors like the location's\nglobal salience and micro-level factors like audience engagement. We also find\na consistent decrease in descriptor context use over the lifespan of each\ncrisis event.

The dissipated energies were solved for uncoated\nand coated 2- 20 $\\mu m$ bubbles over a frequency range of $0.25f_r-2.5f_r$\n($f_r$ is the bubble resonance) and for various acoustic pressures\n(1kPa-300kPa). Thermal effects were examined for air and C3F8 gas cores in each\ncase. For uncoated bubbles with an air gas core and a diameter larger than 4\n$\\mu m$, thermal damping is the strongest damping factor. When pressure\nincreases, the contributions of Rd grow faster and become the dominant damping\nmechanism for pressure dependent resonance frequencies (e.g. fundamental and\nsuper harmonic resonances). For coated bubbles, Cd is the strongest damping\nmechanism. As pressure increases Rd contributes more to damping compared to Ld\nand Td. In case of air bubbles, as pressure increases, the linear thermal model\nlargely deviates from the nonlinear model and accurate modeling requires\ninclusion of the full thermal model. However, for coated C3F8 bubbles of\ndiameter 1-8 $\\mu m$, typically used in medical ultrasound, thermal effects\nmaybe neglected even at higher pressures. We show that the scattering to\ndamping ratio (STDR), a measure of the effectiveness of the bubble as contrast\nagent, is pressure dependent and can be maximized for specific frequency ranges\nand pressures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 03:54:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-20"}

To investigate the nature of multiscale coordination in\nliving systems, one needs a meaningful and systematic way to quantify the\ncomplex dynamics, a challenge in both theoretical and empirical realms. The\npresent work shows how integrating approaches from computational algebraic\ntopology and dynamical systems may help us meet this challenge. In particular,\nwe focus on the application of multiscale topological analysis to coordinated\nrhythmic processes. First, theoretical arguments are introduced as to why\ncertain topological features and their scale-dependency are highly relevant to\nunderstanding complex collective dynamics. Second, we propose a method to\ncapture such dynamically relevant topological information using persistent\nhomology, which allows us to effectively construct a multiscale topological\nportrait of rhythmic coordination. Finally, the method is put to test in\ndetecting transitions in real data from an experiment of rhythmic coordination\nin ensembles of interacting humans. The recurrence plots of topological\nportraits highlight collective transitions in coordination patterns that were\nelusive to more traditional methods. This sensitivity to collective transitions\nwould be lost if the behavioral dynamics of individuals were treated as\nseparate degrees of freedom instead of constituents of the topology that they\ncollectively forge. Such multiscale topological portraits highlight collective\naspects of coordination patterns that are irreducible to properties of\nindividual parts.

Mass\nfunction slope for the entire region of cluster NGC 2506 is found to be\ncomparable with the Salpeter value in the mass range 0.77 - 1.54 Solar mass.\nThe mass function analysis shows that the slope becomes flat when one goes from\nhalo to core region in all the three clusters. A comparison of dynamical age\nwith cluster's age indicates that NGC 2506 and IC 4651 are dynamically relaxed\nclusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 05:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

Though most road traffic is local, a small number of\nlong-distance trips can suffice to move an invasion or disease front forward.\nTherefore, understanding how many agents travel over long distances and which\nroutes they choose is key to successful management of diseases and invasions.\nStochastic gravity models have been used to estimate the distribution of trips\nbetween origins and destinations of agents. However, in large-scale systems it\nis hard to collect the data required to fit these models, as the number of\nlong-distance travellers is small, and origins and destinations can have\nmultiple access points. Therefore, gravity models often provide only relative\nmeasures of the agent flow. Furthermore, gravity models yield no insights into\nwhich roads agents use. We resolve these issues by combining a stochastic\ngravity model with a stochastic route choice model. Our hybrid model can be\nfitted to survey data collected at roads that are used by many long-distance\ntravellers. This decreases the sampling effort, allows us to obtain absolute\npredictions of both vector pressure and pathways, and permits rigorous model\nvalidation. After introducing our approach in general terms, we demonstrate its\nbenefits by applying it to the potential invasion of zebra and quagga mussels\n(Dreissena spp.) to the Canadian province British Columbia. The model yields an\nR-squared value of 0.73 for variance-corrected agent counts at survey\nlocations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 05:50:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 09:12:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 03:45:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 06:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-22"}

OSR allows switching from interpreted\nto compiled code during the execution of this code. The main targets are long\nrunning loops, which need to be represented explicitly, with dedicated\ninformation about condition and body, to be optimized at run time. Bytecode\ninterpreters, however, represent control flow implicitly via unstructured jumps\nand thus do not exhibit the required high-level loop representation. To enable\nOSR also for jump-based - often called unstructured - languages, we propose the\npartial reconstruction of loops in order to explicitly represent them in a\nbytecode interpreter. Besides an outline of the general idea, we implemented\nour approach in Sulong, a bytecode interpreter for LLVM bitcode, which allows\nthe execution of C/C++. We conducted an evaluation with a set of C benchmarks,\nwhich showed speed-ups in warm-up of up to 9x for certain benchmarks. This\nfacilitates execution of programs with long-running loops in rarely called\nfunctions, which would yield significant slowdown without OSR. While shown with\na prototype implementation, the overall idea of our approach is generalizable\nfor all bytecode interpreters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 06:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-20"}

Although CNNs can\naccurately recognize images, recent studies have shown that the convolution\noperations in CNNs commonly have structural sensitivity to specific noise\ncomposed of Fourier basis functions. By exploiting this sensitivity, they\nproposed a simple black-box adversarial attack: Single Fourier attack. To\nreduce structural sensitivity, we can use regularization of convolution filter\nweights since the sensitivity of linear transform can be assessed by the norm\nof the weights. However, standard regularization methods can prevent\nminimization of the loss function because they impose a tight constraint for\nobtaining high robustness. To solve this problem, Absum imposes a loose\nconstraint; it penalizes the absolute values of the summation of the parameters\nin the convolution layers. Absum can improve robustness against single Fourier\nattack while being as simple and efficient as standard regularization methods\n(e.g., weight decay and L1 regularization). Our experiments demonstrate that\nAbsum improves robustness against single Fourier attack more than standard\nregularization methods. Furthermore, we reveal that robust CNNs with Absum are\nmore robust against transferred attacks due to decreasing the common\nsensitivity and against high-frequency noise than standard regularization\nmethods. We also reveal that Absum can improve robustness against\ngradient-based attacks (projected gradient descent) when used with adversarial\ntraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 07:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-20"}

The randomness in diffusive propagation is the main\ncause of inter-symbol interference (ISI) and the limiting factor of high data\nrate MCvD applications. In this paper, an apertured plane is considered between\nthe transmitter and the receiver of an MCvD link. Either after being\nartificially placed or occurring naturally, surfaces or volumes that resemble\nan apertured plane only allow a fraction of the molecules to pass. Contrary to\nintuition, it is observed that such topology may improve communication\nperformance, given the molecules that can pass through the aperture are the\nones that take more directed paths towards the receiver. Furthermore, through\nboth computer simulations and a theoretical signal evaluation metric named\nsignal-to-interference and noise amplitude ratio (SINAR), it is found that the\nsize of the aperture imposes a trade-off between the received signal power and\nthe ISI combating capability of an MCvD system, hinting to an optimal aperture\nsize that minimizes the bit error rate (BER). It is observed that the trend of\nBER is accurately mirrored by SINAR, suggesting the proposed metric's\napplicability to optimization tasks in MCvD systems, including finding the\noptimal aperture size of an apertured plane. In addition, computer simulations\nand SINAR show that said optimal aperture size is affected by the location of\nthe aperture and the bit rate. Lastly, the paper analyzes the effects of radial\nand angular offsets in the placement of the apertured plane, and finds that a\nreduction in BER is still in effect up to certain offset values.

However, the thermal hysteresis and the low sensitivity of the\nmagnetostructural transition to the magnetic field inevitably lead to a\nsizeable irreversibility of the low-field magnetocaloric effect. In this work,\nwe show an alternative way to realize a reversible low-field magnetocaloric\neffect in MnMX-based alloys by taking advantage of the second-order phase\ntransition. With introducing Cu into Co in MnCoGe alloy, the martensitic\ntransition is stabilized at high temperature, while the Curie temperature of\nthe orthorhombic phase is reduced to room temperature. As a result, a\nsecond-order magnetic transition with negligible thermal hysteresis and a large\nmagnetization change can be observed, enabling a large reversible\nmagnetocaloric effect. By both calorimetric and direct measurements, a\nreversible adiabatic temperature change of about 1 K is obtained under a field\nchange of 0-1 T at 304 K, which is larger than that obtained in a first-order\nmagnetostructural transition. To get a better insight into the origin of these\nexperimental results, first-principles calculations are carried out to\ncharacterize the chemical bonds and the magnetic exchange interaction.

Investigating this question is important, as it could provide a\nbetter understanding on how to train candidates for job interviews and make\nrecruiters be aware of influential non verbal behaviour. This research has\nrecently been accelerated due to the development of tools for the automatic\nanalysis of social signals, and the emergence of machine learning methods.\nHowever, these studies are still mainly based on hand engineered features,\nwhich imposes a limit to the discovery of influential social signals. On the\nother side, deep learning methods are a promising tool to discover complex\npatterns without the necessity of feature engineering. In this paper, we focus\non studying influential non verbal social signals in asynchronous job video\ninterviews that are discovered by deep learning methods. We use a previously\npublished deep learning system that aims at inferring the hirability of a\ncandidate with regard to a sequence of interview questions. One particularity\nof this system is the use of attention mechanisms, which aim at identifying the\nrelevant parts of an answer. Thus, information at a fine-grained temporal level\ncould be extracted using global (at the interview level) annotations on\nhirability. While most of the deep learning systems use attention mechanisms to\noffer a quick visualization of slices when a rise of attention occurs, we\nperform an in-depth analysis to understand what happens during these moments.\nFirst, we propose a methodology to automatically extract slices where there is\na rise of attention (attention slices). Second, we study the content of\nattention slices by comparing them with randomly sampled slices. Finally, we\nshow that they bear significantly more information for hirability than randomly\nsampled slices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 08:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-20"}

We aim to determine the geometry, density gradient, and velocity\nstructure of jets in post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binaries. Methods.\nOur high cadence time series of high-resolution optical spectra of jet-creating\npost-AGB binary systems provide us with a unique tomography of the jet. We\ndetermine the spatio-kinematic structure of the jets based on these data by\nfitting the synthetic spectral line profiles created by our model to the\nobserved, orbital phase-resolved, H{\\alpha}-line profiles of these systems. The\nfitting routine is provided with an initial spectrum and is allowed to test\nthree configurations, derived from three specific jet launching models: a\nstellar jet launched by the star, an X-wind, and a disk wind configuration. We\napply a Markov-chain Monte Carlo routine in order to fit our model to the\nobservations. Our fitting code is tested on the post-AGB binary IRAS19135+3937.\nResults.

So far, many\nsupervised data-driven models have been applied to solve inverse imaging\nproblems. These models need massive amounts of data to train, and are limited\nby the dataset characteristics. In FP problems, generic datasets are always\nscarce, and the optical aberration varies greatly under different acquisition\nconditions. To address these dilemmas, we model the forward physical imaging\nprocess as an interpretable physics-guided neural network (PgNN), where the\nreconstructed image in the complex domain is considered as the learnable\nparameters of the neural network. Since the optimal parameters of the PgNN can\nbe derived by minimizing the difference between the model-generated images and\nreal captured angle-varied images corresponding to the same scene, the proposed\nPgNN can get rid of the problem of massive training data as in traditional\nsupervised methods. Applying the alternate updating mechanism and the total\nvariation regularization, PgNN can flexibly reconstruct images with improved\nperformance. In addition, the Zernike mode is incorporated to compensate for\noptical aberrations to enhance the robustness of FP reconstructions. As a\ndemonstration, we show our method can reconstruct images with smooth\nperformance and detailed information in both simulated and experimental\ndatasets.

For asymptotically large\nblocklengths, constant composition distribution matching (CCDM) is known to\ngenerate the target capacity-achieving distribution. As the blocklength\ndecreases, however, the resulting rate loss diminishes the efficiency of CCDM.\nWe claim that for such short blocklengths and over the additive white Gaussian\nchannel (AWGN), the objective of shaping should be reformulated as obtaining\nthe most energy-efficient signal space for a given rate (rather than matching\ndistributions). In light of this interpretation, multiset-partition DM (MPDM),\nenumerative sphere shaping (ESS) and shell mapping (SM), are reviewed as\nenergy-efficient shaping techniques. Numerical results show that MPDM and SpSh\nhave smaller rate losses than CCDM. SpSh--whose sole objective is to maximize\nthe energy efficiency--is shown to have the minimum rate loss amongst all. We\nprovide simulation results of the end-to-end decoding performance showing that\nup to 1 dB improvement in power efficiency over uniform signaling can be\nobtained with MPDM and SpSh at blocklengths around 200.

Current research focuses on identifying and\ncontrolling the interactions that define the magnetic chirality. The influence\nof the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) and, recently, the\ndipolar interactions have previously been reported.

Several kinematic and chemical substructures have been recently found\namongst Milky Way halo stars with retrograde motions. It is currently unclear\nhow these various structures are related to each other. This Letter aims to\nshed light on this issue. Methods. We explore the retrograde halo with an\naugmented version of the Gaia DR2 RVS sample, extended with data from three\nlarge spectroscopic surveys, namely RAVE, APOGEE and LAMOST. In this dataset,\nwe identify several structures using the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm. We\ndiscuss their properties and possible links using all the available chemical\nand dynamical information. Results. In concordance with previous work, we find\nthat stars with [Fe/H] $<-1$ have more retrograde motions than those with\n[Fe/H] $>-1$. The retrograde halo contains a mixture of debris from objects\nlike Gaia-Enceladus, Sequoia, and even the chemically defined thick-disc. We\nfind that the Sequoia has a smaller range in orbital energies than previously\nsuggested and is confined to high-energy. Sequoia could be a small galaxy in\nitself, but since it overlaps both in integrals-of-motion space and chemical\nabundance space with the less bound debris of Gaia-Enceladus, its nature cannot\nbe fully settled yet. In the low-energy part of the halo we find evidence for\nat least one more distinct structure: Thamnos. Stars in Thamnos are on low\ninclination, mildly eccentric retrograde orbits, moving at\n$v_{\\phi}\\approx-150$ km/s, and are chemically distinct from the other\nstructures. Conclusions. Even with the excellent Gaia DR2 data it remains\nchallenging to piece together all the fragments found in the retrograde halo.\nAt this point, we are very much in need of large datasets with high-quality\nhigh-resolution spectra and tailored high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations\nof galaxy mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 11:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

A space\nor Lunar-based ultra-low-frequency (or ultra-long-wavelength, ULW) array would\nsuffer significantly less from these limitations and hence would open up the\nlast, virtually unexplored frequency domain in the electromagnetic spectrum.

The situation commonly arises in\ndistributed computing environments where job arrivals are rate controlled (each\njob needs one token to enter the system), but capacity limitations call for\ndistributing jobs across multiple compute resources with scalability\nconsiderations preventing the use of a centralized rate control component (each\ncompute resource is responsible for monitoring and enforcing that the job\nstream it receives conforms to a certain traffic envelope). The question we\naddress is to what extent splitting a token bucket into multiple sub-token\nbuckets that individually rate control a subset of the original arrival process\naffects job latency, when jobs wait for a token whenever the token bucket is\nempty upon their arrival. Our contribution is to establish that independent of\nthe job arrival process and how jobs are distributed across compute resources\n(and sub-token buckets), splitting a token bucket always increases the sum of\njob latencies in the token buckets, and consequently the average job latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 13:21:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-20"}

For distance-related graph problems, it is often\ncrucial that such a decomposition results in clusters of small diameter, while\nthe probability that an edge is cut by the decomposition scales linearly with\nthe length of the edge. There is a large body of literature on low diameter\ngraph decomposition with small edge cutting probabilities, with all existing\ntechniques heavily building on single source shortest paths (SSSP)\ncomputations. Unfortunately, in many theoretical models for large-scale\ncomputations, the SSSP task constitutes a complexity bottleneck. Therefore, it\nis desirable to replace exact SSSP computations with approximate ones. However\nthis imposes a fundamental challenge since the existing constructions of such\ndecompositions inherently rely on the subtractive form of the triangle\ninequality. The current paper overcomes this obstacle by developing a technique\ntermed blurry ball growing. By combining this technique with a clever\nalgorithmic idea of Miller et al. (SPAA 13), we obtain a construction of low\ndiameter decompositions with small edge cutting probabilities which replaces\nexact SSSP computations by (a small number of) approximate ones. The utility of\nour approach is showcased by deriving efficient algorithms that work in the\nCongest, PRAM, and semi-streaming models of computation. As an application, we\nobtain metric tree embedding algorithms in the vein of Bartal (FOCS 96) whose\ncomputational complexities in these models are optimal up to polylogarithmic\nfactors. Our embeddings have the additional useful property that the tree can\nbe mapped back to the original graph such that each edge is \"used\" only O(log\nn) times, which is of interest for capacitated problems and simulating Congest\nalgorithms on the tree into which the graph is embedded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 13:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-20"}

Yet, only a\nfew wind measurements are available in the region and none at hub height, thus\nextrapolations are needed to estimate wind speed as a function of height. A\ncommon method is the log-law, which is based on surface roughness length (z0).\nNo reliable estimates of z0 for the region have been presented in the\nliterature. Here, we fill this knowledge gap using two field campaigns that\nwere conducted in the Nantucket Sound at the Cape Wind (CW) platform. We tested\nthree different methods to calculate z0: 1) analytical, dependent on friction\nvelocity u* and a stability function psi; 2) the Charnock relationship between\nz0 and u*; and 3) a statistical method based on wind speed observed at the\nthree levels. The first two methods are physical, whereas the statistical\nmethod is purely mathematical. Comparing mean and median of z0, we find that\nthe median is a more robust statistics. In general, the median z0 exhibits\nlittle seasonal variability and a weak dependency on atmospheric stability,\nwhich was predominantly unstable (54-67%). The statistical method, despite\ndelivering unrealistic z0 values at times, gives the best estimates of 60-m\nwinds. The unrealistic z0 values are caused by non-monotonic wind speed\nprofiles, occurring about 41% of the time, and should not be rejected because\nthey produce realistic fits. In summary, if wind speed data from multiple\nlevels are available, the statistical method is recommended. If multi-level\nwind speeds are not available but advanced sonic anemometry is available at one\nlevel, the analytical method is recommended over the Charnock's. If a constant\nvalue of z0 is sought after to characterize the region, we recommend the median\nfrom the statistical method, i.e., 6.09*10^(-3) m.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 14:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

This historical login activity is\nrepresented as a collection of daily login graphs, which encode authentications\namong accessed systems.

The construction of dispersion models\ninvolves the solution of integral equations that are, in general, untractable.\nThese difficulties disappear when a more mathematical structure is assumed: it\nreduces to the calculation of a moment generating function or of a\nRiemann-Stieltjes integral for the exponential dispersion and the proper\ndispersion models, respectively.

With\nscalability and flexibility in mind, the existing link switching protocols\nusually consider each single link to be scheduled independently, e.g., the\nworm-hole switching protocol. The flexibility of such link-based arbitrations\nallows each packet to be distributed over multiple routers but also increases\nthe number of possible link states (the number of flits in a buffer) that have\nto be considered in the worst-case timing analysis.\n  For achieving timing predictability, we propose less flexible switching\nprotocols, called \\emph{\\Simultaneous Progressing Switching Protocols}\n(SP$^2$), in which the links used by a flow \\emph{either} all simultaneously\ntransmit one flit (if it exists) of this flow \\emph{or} none of them transmits\nany flit of this flow.

A\nmultimessenger campaign triggered by the coincident observation of a gamma-ray\nflare and a 290-TeV IceCube neutrino pinpointed the cosmic-ray accelerator TXS\n0506+056. Subsequently, the IceCube archival data revealed a 3-month burst of\n13 cosmic neutrinos in 2014-15 that dominates the neutrino flux of the source\nover the 9.5 years of observations. The original identification of the source\nas a blazar was puzzling because it requires a major accretion event onto the\nrotating supermassive black hole to accommodate the neutrino burst. Subsequent\nhigh-resolution radio images of the source with the VLBA brought to light a\nmerger of two galaxies, revealed by the interaction of two jets entangled in\nthe source. Recently, the blazar PKS 1502+106 was found in the direction of a\n300-TeV neutrino alert, IC-190730. OVRA radio observations at 15 GHz indicate\nthat the neutrino also coincides with the highest flux density of a flare that\nstarted five years ago.

The fusion of information is done using multiple\nfeatures such as optical flow, divergence and intensity values. These features\nextracted from the images are used to segment the pixels into different classes\nin an unsupervised way. A comparative analysis is done by using multiple\nclustering algorithms for segmentation. Here the Markov Random Field performs\nmore accurately than other segmentation algorithms since it characterizes the\nspatial interactions of pixels using a finite number of parameters. It builds a\nprobabilistic image model that selects the most likely labeling using the\nmaximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. This unsupervised approach is tested on\nvarious images and achieves a frame-wise fire detection rate of 95.39%. Hence\nthis method can be used for early detection of fire in real-time and it can be\nincorporated into an indoor or outdoor surveillance system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 17:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

Different from\nexisting methods, relative positions of 3D points rather than absolute\ncoordinates in the world coordinate system are employed in our method, and it\nhas a unique solution. The application scope of POSIT (Pose from Orthography\nand Scaling with Iteration) algorithm is generalized to fish-eye cameras by\ncombining with the radially symmetric projection model. The image point\nrelationship between the pinhole camera and the fish-eye camera is derived\nbased on their projection model. The general pose expression which fits for\ndifferent cameras can be acquired by four noncoplanar object points and their\ncorresponding image points. Accurate estimation results are calculated\niteratively. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that the pose\nestimation results of our method are more stable and accurate than\nstate-of-the-art methods.

In such\napplication, the task management load is outsourced to the robots to reduce the\nhuman's workload, freeing the human to do more important work. The regret\ndecision model is first used by each robot for deciding whether to request\nhuman service, then is extended for optimally queuing the requests from\nmultiple robots. For the movement of the robots in the domain search, we\ndesigned a path planning algorithm based on dynamic programming for each robot.\nThe simulation shows that the human-like characteristics, namely, risk-seeking\nand risk-aversion, indeed bring some appealing effects for balancing the\nworkload and performance in the human-multi-robot team.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 18:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

These oxygenated molecules have adequate\ncarbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms that can be used for developing new\nvalue-added molecules (chemicals or transportation fuels). One motivation for\nour study stems from the fact that a liquid phase upgrading using mineral acid\nis a cost-effective chemical transformation. In this chemical upgrading\nprocess, adding a proton (positively charged atomic hydrogen) to an oxygen atom\nis a central step. The protonation energies of oxygen atoms in a molecule\ndetermine the thermodynamic feasibility of the reaction and likely chemical\nreaction pathway. A quantum chemical model based on coupled cluster theory is\nused to compute accurate thermochemical properties such as the protonation\nenergies of oxygen atoms and the feasibility of protonation-based chemical\ntransformations. However, this method is too computationally expensive to\nexplore a large space of chemical transformations. We develop a graph neural\nnetwork approach for predicting protonation energies of oxygen atoms of\nhundreds of bioxygenate molecules to predict the feasibility of aqueous acidic\nreactions. Our approach relies on an iterative local nonlinear embedding that\ngradually leads to global influence of distant atoms and a output layer that\npredicts the protonation energy. Our approach is geared to site-specific\npredictions for individual oxygen atoms of a molecule in comparison with\ncommonly used graph convolutional networks that focus on a singular molecular\nproperty prediction. We demonstrate that our approach is effective in learning\nthe location and magnitudes of protonation energies of oxygenated molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 21:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}
