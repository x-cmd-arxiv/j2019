Magic numbers define the nuclear shells, which are considered to be\nactive, only if they are partially occupied by nucleons. As a consequence the\nsingle particle interactions of the valence nucleons lead to the description of\nthe collective properties of the whole nucleus in the shell model theory. But\nphenomena as the island of inversion, the shape coexistence and the break down\nof the N=20 magic number reveal that the above definition of a magic number is\ndeficient. A complementary definition should rely on the selection rules of the\nsingle particle interactions. Specifically the selection rules of the\nquadrupole-quadrupole interaction lead to two sets of magic numbers, namely the\nharmonic oscillator magic numbers 2, 8 20, 40, 70, 112, ... and the spin-orbit\nSO-like magic numbers 2, 6, 14, 28, 50, 82, 126, ...

We\npresent here a demo-version of a catalog for one often-discussed UHECR source\nclass, radio galaxies (or radio-loud AGN), which is based on a complete\ntheoretical description of jet-energetics, particle acceleration physics,\nrelativistic beaming effects and nuclear composition, parametrized by a\ncomprehensible set of adjustable physical quantities.

Besides, scientists also discovered that light can\npossess an angular momentum (AM), a spin angular momentum (SAM) associated with\ncircular polarization and an orbital angular momentum (OAM) owing to the\nazimuthally dependent phase. Even though such angular momenta are longitudinal\nin general, a SAM transverse to the propagation has opened up a variety of key\napplications [1]. In contrast, investigations of the transverse OAM are quite\nrare due to its complex nature. Here we demonstrate a simple method to generate\na three dimensional (3D) optical wave packet with a controllable purely\ntransverse OAM. Such a wave packet is a spatiotemporal (ST) vortex, which\nresembles an advancing cyclone, with optical energy flowing in the spatial and\ntemporal dimension. Contrary to the transverse SAM, the magnitude of the\ntransverse OAM carried by the photonic cyclone is scalable to a larger value by\nsimple adjustments. Since the ST vortex carries a controllable OAM in the\nunique transverse dimension, it has a strong potential for novel applications\nthat may not be possible otherwise. The scheme reported here can be readily\nadapted for the other spectra regime and different wave fields, opening\ntremendous opportunities for the study and applications of ST vortex in much\nbroader scopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Aug 2019 19:47:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

In addition, we demonstrate that the generated field can be helical\ndue to the tachyonic amplification phase prior to the onset of oscillation.\nFurthermore, it is shown that the parametric resonance during reheating can\ngenerate a circularly polarized (hyper) magnetic field in a void region with\nthe present amplitude $B_0 =3\\times 10^{-15}$Gauss and the coherent length\n$\\lambda_0 = 0.3$pc without being plagued by the backreaction issue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Aug 2019 21:43:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 16:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

Its recent activity includes emplacement of a lava\ndome, with explosions and frequent scoria and ash emissions. This study is part\nof a longer-term project of volcanic hazard monitoring that includes other\nMexican volcanoes, like the Colima.

The key to our approach\nis a novel progressive shaping framework that alternates between mesh\ndeformation and topology modification. While a deformation network predicts the\nper-vertex translations that reduce the gap between the reconstructed mesh and\nthe ground truth, a novel topology modification network is employed to prune\nthe error-prone faces, enabling the evolution of topology. By iterating over\nthe two procedures, one can progressively modify the mesh topology while\nachieving higher reconstruction accuracy. Moreover, a boundary refinement\nnetwork is designed to refine the boundary conditions to further improve the\nvisual quality of the reconstructed mesh.

In the CRG problem, two parties, Alice and Bob,\nreceive samples $X_i$ and $Y_i$, respectively, drawn jointly from a source\ndistribution $\\mu$. The two parties wish to agree on a common random key\nconsisting of many bits of randomness, by exchanging messages that depend on\neach party's input and the previous messages. In this work we study the\namortized version of the problem, i.e., the number of bits of communication\nneeded per random bit output by Alice and Bob, in the limit as the number of\nbits generated tends to infinity. The amortized version of the CRG problem has\nbeen extensively studied, though very little was known about the effect of\ninteraction on this problem. Recently Bafna et al. (SODA 2019) considered the\nnon-amortized version of the problem: they gave a family of sources $\\mu_{r,n}$\nparameterized by $r,n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, such that with $r+2$ rounds of\ncommunication one can generate $n$ bits of common randomness with this source\nwith $O(r\\log n)$ communication, whereas with roughly $r/2$ rounds the\ncommunication complexity is $\\Omega(n/{\\rm poly}\\log n)$.

To tackle these challenges, by exploiting the\nsuperposition property of a multiple-access channel and the functional\ndecomposition properties, the recently proposed technique, over-the-air\ncomputation (AirComp), enables an effective joint data collection and\ncomputation from concurrent sensor transmissions. In this paper, we focus on a\nsingle-antenna AirComp system consisting of $K$ sensors and one receiver (i.e.,\nthe fusion center).

In this paper, we propose a\nnew sequential deep matching (SDM) model to capture users' dynamic preferences\nby combining short-term sessions and long-term behaviors. Compared with\nexisting sequence-aware recommendation methods, we tackle the following two\ninherent problems in real-world applications: (1) there could exist multiple\ninterest tendencies in one session. (2) long-term preferences may not be\neffectively fused with current session interests. Long-term behaviors are\nvarious and complex, hence those highly related to the short-term session\nshould be kept for fusion. We propose to encode behavior sequences with two\ncorresponding components: multi-head self-attention module to capture multiple\ntypes of interests and long-short term gated fusion module to incorporate\nlong-term preferences. Successive items are recommended after matching between\nsequential user behavior vector and item embedding vectors.

First, a new CNN architecture is introduced that has\nscored a fourth place in the recent Pose Estimation Challenge hosted by\nStanford's Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB) and the Advanced Concepts Team\n(ACT) of the European Space Agency (ESA). The proposed architecture first\ndetects the object by regressing a 2D bounding box, then a separate network\nregresses the 2D locations of the known surface keypoints from an image of the\ntarget cropped around the detected Region-of-Interest (RoI). In a single-image\npose estimation problem, the extracted 2D keypoints can be used in conjunction\nwith corresponding 3D model coordinates to compute relative pose via the\nPerspective-n-Point (PnP) problem. These keypoint locations have known\ncorrespondences to those in the 3D model, since the CNN is trained to predict\nthe corners in a pre-defined order, allowing for bypassing the computationally\nexpensive feature matching processes. This work also introduces and explores\nthe texture randomization to train a CNN for spaceborne applications.\nSpecifically, Neural Style Transfer (NST) is applied to randomize the texture\nof the spacecraft in synthetically rendered images.

It\nis also shown that when using the texture-randomized spacecraft images during\ntraining, regressing 3D bounding box corners leads to better performance on\nspaceborne images than regressing surface keypoints, as NST inevitably distorts\nthe spacecraft's geometric features to which the surface keypoints have closer\nrelation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2019 13:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

The first system (type 1 junction)\nconsists of superconductors with heavy metal interlayers linked by a\nferromagnetic bridge, such that the spin-orbit coupling is finite only at the\nsuperconductor/heavy metal interface. In the second type (type 2) of system we\nassume that the spin orbit coupling is finite in the bridge region. The length\nof both junctions is larger than the magnetic decay length such that the\nJosephson current is carried uniquely by the long-range triplet component of\nthe condensate. The latter is generated by the spin-orbit coupling via two\nmechanisms, spin precession and inhomogeneous spin-relaxation. We show that the\ncurrent can be controlled by rotating the magnetization of the bridge or by\ntuning the strength of the spin-orbit coupling in type 2 junctions., and also\ndiscuss how the ground-state of the junction can be tuned from a $0$ to a $\\pi$\nphase difference between the superconducting electrodes. In leading order in\nthe spin-orbit coupling, the spin precession dominates the behavior of the\ntriplet component and both\n  junctions behave similarly. However, when spin relaxation effects are\nincluded junction of type 2 offers a wider parameter range in which $0$-$\\pi$\ntransitions take place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2019 13:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

These operations are often carried out on a distributed computing\nplatform with a master server and multiple workers in the cloud operating in\nparallel. For such distributed platforms, it has been recently shown that\ncoding over the input data matrices can reduce the computational delay,\nyielding a trade-off between recovery threshold, i.e., the number of workers\nrequired to recover the matrix product, and communication load, i.e., the total\namount of data to be downloaded from the workers. In this paper, in addition to\nexact recovery requirements, we impose security and privacy constraints on the\ndata matrices, and study the recovery threshold as a function of the\ncommunication load. We first assume that both matrices contain private\ninformation and that workers can collude to eavesdrop on the content of these\ndata matrices. For this problem, we introduce a novel class of secure codes,\nreferred to as secure generalized PolyDot (SGPD) codes, that generalize\nstate-of-the-art non-secure codes for matrix multiplication. SGPD codes allow a\nflexible trade-off between recovery threshold and communication load for a\nfixed maximum number of colluding workers while providing perfect secrecy for\nthe two data matrices. We then study a connection between secure matrix\nmultiplication and private information retrieval. We specifically assume that\none of the data matrices is taken from a public set known to all the workers.\nIn this setup, the identity of the matrix of interest should be kept private\nfrom the workers. For this model, we present a variant of generalized PolyDot\ncodes that can guarantee both secrecy of one matrix and privacy for the\nidentity of the other matrix for the case of no colluding servers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2019 14:09:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 18:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-19"}

It comprises the construction of\norder batches and the associated order picker routes, and the assignment and\nsequencing of those batches to multiple order pickers. The ever-increasing\ncompetitiveness among e-commerce companies has made the joint optimization of\nthis order picking process inevitable. Inspired by the large number of product\nreturns and the many but small-sized customer orders, we address a new\nintegrated order picking process problem. We integrate the restocking of\nreturned products into regular order picking routes and we allow for the\ndecomposition of customer orders so that multiple batches may contain products\nfrom the same customer order. We thereby generalize the existing models on\norder picking processing. We provide Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)\nformulations and a tailored adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic that,\namongst others, exploits these MIPs. We propose a new set of practically-sized\nbenchmark instances, consisting of up to 5547 to be picked products and 2491 to\nbe restocked products. On those large-scale instances, we show that integrating\nthe restocking of returned products into regular order picker routes results in\ncost-savings of 10 to 15%. Allowing for the decomposition of the customer\norders' products results in cost savings of up to 44% compared to not allowing\nthis. Finally, we show that on average cost-savings of 17.4% can be obtained by\nusing our ALNS instead of heuristics typically used in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2019 11:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-05"}

This purpose could be for visual interpretation or for\neffective extraction of required details. Nevertheless, some acquired images\nare often associated with pixels of low dynamic range and as such result in low\ncontrast images. Enhancing the contrast therefore tends to increase the dynamic\nrange of the gray levels in the acquired image so as to span the full intensity\nrange. Techniques such as Histogram Equalization (HE) and fuzzy technique can\nbe adopted for contrast enhancement. HE adjusts the contrast of an input image\nby modifying the intensity distribution of its histogram. It is characterized\nby providing a global approach to image enhancement, computationally fast and\neasy to implement approach but can introduce unnatural artifacts and other\nundesirable elements to the resulting image. Fuzzy technique on its part\nenhances image by mapping the image gray level intensities into a fuzzy plane\nusing membership functions; modifying the membership functions as desired and\nmapping back into the gray level plane. Thus, details at desired areas can be\nenhanced at the expense of increase in computational cost.
