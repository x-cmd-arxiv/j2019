Since\nMULE learns a single language branch in the multimodal model, we can also scale\nto support many languages, and languages with fewer annotations can take\nadvantage of the good representation learned from other (more abundant)\nlanguage data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MULE on the bidirectional\nimage-sentence retrieval task, supporting up to four languages in a single\nmodel.

Photon number\nresolving (PNR) detection, a readily-realizable non-Gaussian measurement, has\nbeen a popular tool to try and engineer non-Gaussian states for universal\nquantum processing. In this paper, we consider PNR detection of a subset of the\nmodes of a zero-mean pure multi-mode Gaussian state as a means to herald a\ntarget non-Gaussian state on the undetected modes. This is motivated from the\nease of scalable preparation of Gaussian states that have zero mean, using\nsqueezed vacuum and passive linear optics.

A well known\nconjecture states that, for a Ryser design on \\textit{v} points $\\mbox{\n}4\\lambda-1\\leq v\\leq\\lambda^2+\\lambda+1$.\n  A partial support for this conjecture is obtained. Finally a special case of\nRyser designs with two block sizes is shown to be of Type-1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2019 16:48:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 16:10:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 13:58:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-16"}

Therefore, it is desirable to exploit this multi-dimensional space for\nvarious quantum applications by fully controlling the properties of the\nentangled photons in multiple DOFs. While current entangled-photon sources are\ncapable of generating entanglement in one or more DOFs, there is currently a\nlack of practical techniques that can shape and control the entanglement\nproperties in multiple DOFs.

We then experimentally generate\nphoton-pairs with tunable entanglement properties by manipulating the\ndispersion and birefringence properties of the linear medium placed in between\ntwo entangled-photon sources. This is done in an all-fibre, phase stable, and\nalignment-free configuration. Our results show that the cascade structure\noffers a great deal of flexibility in tuning the properties of entangled\nphotons in multiple DOFs, opening up a new avenue in engineering quantum light\nsources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2019 17:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}

Inspired by VQ-VAE2,\nMIDI-Sandwich2 expands the dimension of the original hierarchical model by\nusing multiple independent Binary Variational Autoencoder (BVAE) models without\nsharing weights to process the information of each track. Then, with\nmulti-modal fusion technology, the upper layer named Multi-modal Fusion\nGeneration VAE (MFG-VAE) combines the latent space vectors generated by the\nrespective tracks, and uses the decoder to perform the ascending dimension\nreconstruction to simulate the inverse operation of multi-modal fusion,\nmulti-modal generation, so as to realize the RNN-based multi-track symbolic\nmusic generation. For the multi-track format pianoroll, we also improve the\noutput binarization method of MuseGAN, which solves the problem that the\nrefinement step of the original scheme is difficult to differentiate and the\ngradient is hard to descent, making the generated song more expressive. The\nmodel is validated on the Lakh Pianoroll Dataset (LPD) multi-track dataset.\nCompared to the MuseGAN, MIDI-Sandwich2 can not only generate harmonious\nmulti-track music, the generation quality is also close to the state of the art\nlevel. At the same time, by using the VAE to restore songs, the semi-generated\nsongs reproduced by the MIDI-Sandwich2 are more beautiful than the pure\nautogeneration music generated by MuseGAN. Both the code and the audition audio\nsamples are open source on https://github.com/LiangHsia/MIDI-S2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2019 17:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

However, this assumption\nis often untenable as the online social networks are quite sparse and a\nmajority of users only have a small number of friends. Besides, explicit\nfriends may not share similar interests because of the randomness in the\nprocess of building social networks. Therefore, discovering a number of\nreliable friends for each user plays an important role in advancing social\nrecommendation. Unlike other studies which focus on extracting valuable\nexplicit social links, our work pays attention to identifying reliable friends\nin both the observed and unobserved social networks. Concretely, in this paper,\nwe propose an end-to-end social recommendation framework based on Generative\nAdversarial Nets (GAN). The framework is composed of two blocks: a generator\nthat is used to produce friends that can possibly enhance the social\nrecommendation model, and a discriminator that is responsible for assessing\nthese generated friends and ranking the items according to both the current\nuser and her friends' preferences. With the competition between the generator\nand the discriminator, our framework can dynamically and adaptively generate\nreliable friends who can perfectly predict the current user' preference at a\nspecific time. As a result, the sparsity and unreliability problems of explicit\nsocial relations can be mitigated and the social recommendation performance is\nsignificantly improved. Experimental studies on real-world datasets demonstrate\nthe superiority of our framework and verify the positive effects of the\ngenerated reliable friends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2019 19:03:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

While UV-Vis\nspectroscopy remains one of key experimental methods for the interrogation of\nthese devices, a rigorous bridge between coarse-grained simulations and\nspectroscopy has never been established. Here we address this challenge by\ndeveloping a method that predicts spectra of conjugated polymers directly from\ncoarse-grained representations while avoiding ad-hoc procedures such as\nback-mapping from coarse-grained to atomistic representations followed by\ncomputing the spectra using standard quantum chemistry methods. Our approach is\nbased on a generative deep learning model: the long-short-term memory recurrent\nneural network (LSTM-RNN) and it is suggested by the apparent similarity\nbetween natural languages and the mathematical structure of the perturbative\nexpansions of the excited state energies due to small fluctuations of the\npolymer conformation.

We show: 1) that differential privacy\nensures that the expectation of any query on the posterior distribution on\ndatasets induced by the transcript of the interaction is close to its true\nvalue on the data distribution, and 2) sample accuracy on its own ensures that\nany query answer produced by the mechanism is close to its posterior\nexpectation with high probability. This second claim follows from a thought\nexperiment in which we imagine that the dataset is resampled from the posterior\ndistribution after the mechanism has committed to its answers. The transfer\ntheorem then follows by summing these two bounds, and in particular, avoids the\n\"monitor argument\" used to derive high probability bounds in prior work. An\nupshot of our new proof technique is that the concrete bounds we obtain are\nsubstantially better than the best previously known bounds, even though the\nimprovements are in the constants, rather than the asymptotics (which are known\nto be tight). As we show, our new bounds outperform the naive\n\"sample-splitting\" baseline at dramatically smaller dataset sizes compared to\nthe previous state of the art, bringing techniques from this literature closer\nto practicality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 00:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

However, current\nlearning-based active learning approaches still require sufficient training\ndata so as to generalize meta-learning models for active learning. This is\ncontrary to the nature of active learning which typically starts with a small\nnumber of labeled samples. The unavailability of large amounts of labeled\nsamples for training meta-learning models would inevitably lead to poor\nperformance (e.g., instabilities and overfitting). In our paper, we tackle\nthese issues by proposing a novel learning-based active learning framework,\ncalled Learning To Sample (LTS). This framework has two key components: a\nsampling model and a boosting model, which can mutually learn from each other\nin iterations to improve the performance of each other. Within this framework,\nthe sampling model incorporates uncertainty sampling and diversity sampling\ninto a unified process for optimization, enabling us to actively select the\nmost representative and informative samples based on an optimized integration\nof uncertainty and diversity. To evaluate the effectiveness of the LTS\nframework, we have conducted extensive experiments on three different\nclassification tasks: image classification, salary level prediction, and entity\nresolution. The experimental results show that our LTS framework significantly\noutperforms all the baselines when the label budget is limited, especially for\ndatasets with highly imbalanced classes. In addition to this, our LTS framework\ncan effectively tackle the cold start problem occurring in many existing active\nlearning approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 01:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

Although the presence of clicks signals the users'\npreference to some extent, the lack of such clicks does not necessarily\nindicate a negative response from the users, as it is possible that the users\nwere not exposed to the items (positive-unlabeled problem). This leads to a\ndifficulty in predicting the users' preferences from implicit feedback.\nPrevious studies addressed the positive-unlabeled problem by uniformly\nupweighting the loss for the positive feedback data or estimating the\nconfidence of each data having relevance information via the EM-algorithm.\nHowever, these methods failed to address the missing-not-at-random problem in\nwhich popular or frequently recommended items are more likely to be clicked\nthan other items even if a user does not have a considerable interest in them.\nTo overcome these limitations, we first define an ideal loss function to be\noptimized to realize recommendations that maximize the relevance and propose an\nunbiased estimator for the ideal loss.

However, in future\nlong baseline interferometers (LBIs), the filter cavity required to achieve the\nbroadband squeezing has a low bandwidth -- necessitating a very long cavity to\nmitigate the issue from optical loss. It has been shown recently that by taking\nadvantage of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement in the squeezed light\nsource, the interferometer can simultaneously act as a detector and a filter\ncavity.

We prove that the resulting definable\nhomology theory provides a strictly finer invariant than Steenrod homology for\ncompact metrizable spaces up to homotopy. In particular, we show that pro-tori\nare completely classified up to homeomorphism by their definable homology. This\nis in contrast with the fact that, for example, there exist uncountably many\npairwise non-homeomorphic solenoids with the same Steenrod homology groups. We\nsimilarly develop a definable cohomology theory which strengthens \\v{C}ech\ncohomology and we show that it completely classifies complements of pro-tori up\nto homeomorphism.\n  We also apply definable cohomology theory to the study of the space $\\left[\nX,S^{2}\\right] $ of homotopy classes of continuous functions from a solenoid\ncomplement $X$ to the $2$-sphere, which was initiated by Borsuk and Eilenberg\nin 1936.

Recent studies suggest that planetesimal collisions and\nthe resulting impact melts are promising for forming chondrules. Given that the\ndynamics of planetesimals is a key in impact-based chondrule formation\nscenarios, we here perform direct $N$-body simulations to examine how the\npresence of Jupiter affects the properties of chondrule-forming collisions. Our\nresults show that the absence/presence of Jupiter considerably changes the\nproperties of high velocity collisions whose impact velocities are higher than\n2.5 km s$^{-1}$; high velocity collisions occur due to impacts between\nprotoplanets and planetesimals for the case without Jupiter; for the case with\nJupiter, eccentricities of planetesimals are pumped up by the secular and\nresonant perturbations from Jupiter. We also categorize the resulting\nplanetesimal collisions and find that most of high velocity collisions are\nclassified as grazing ones for both cases. To examine the effect of Jupiter on\nchondrule formation directly, we adopt the impact jetting scenario and compute\nthe resulting abundance of chondrules. Our results show that for the case\nwithout Jupiter, chondrule formation proceeds in the inside-out manner,\nfollowing the growth of protoplanets. If Jupiter is present, the location and\ntiming of chondrule formation are determined by Jupiter's eccentricity, which\nis treated as a free parameter in our simulations. Thus, the existence of\nJupiter is the key parameter for specifying when and where chondrule formation\noccurs for impact-based scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 06:46:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 01:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

Traditional tracking usually relies on a single\nbounding box of the target object, however, more detailed information should be\nprovided by visual tracking such as binary mask. In this paper, we proposed a\nSSLT (Saliency-based Semi-supervised Learning for Tracking) algorithm that\nprovides both the bounding box and segmentation binary mask of target\nsatellites at 12 frame per second without requirement of annotated data. Our\nmethod, SSLT, improves the segmentation performance by generating a saliency\nmap based semi-supervised on-line learning approach within the initial bounding\nbox estimated by tracking. Once a customized segmentation model has been\ntrained, the bounding box and satellite trajectory will be refined using the\nbinary segmentation result.

In this paper, this source model is referred to as\njoint/partially-joint/individual multiple datasets multidimensional (JpJI-MDM),\nand accordingly, a source extraction method is developed. Method: We present a\ndeflation-based algorithm utilizing higher order cumulants to analyze the\nJpJI-MDM source model. The algorithm maximizes a cost function which leads to\nan eigenvalue problem solved with thin-SVD (singular value decomposition)\nfactorization. Furthermore, we introduce the JpJI-feature which indicates the\nspatial shape of each source and the amount of its jointness with other\nsubjects.

The research on trunk movements in human\nlocomotion is insufficient, and no formalism is known to transfer human motion\npatterns onto robots. Related work mostly focuses on the lower extremities, and\nsimplifies the problem by stabilizing the trunk at a fixed angle. In contrast,\nhumans display significant trunk motions that follow the natural dynamics of\nthe gait. In this work, we use a spring-loaded inverted pendulum model with a\ntrunk (TSLIP) together with a virtual point (VP) target to create trunk\noscillations and investigate the impact of these movements. We analyze how the\nVP location and forward speed determine the direction and magnitude of the\ntrunk oscillations. We show that positioning the VP below the center of mass\n(CoM) can explain the forward trunk pitching observed in human running. The VP\nbelow the CoM leads to a synergistic work between the hip and leg, reducing the\nleg loading. However, it comes at the cost of increased peak hip torque. Our\nresults provide insights for leveraging the trunk motion to redistribute joint\nloads and potentially improve the energy efficiency in humanoid robots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 07:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

We aim to\nunderstand the structure of these disks and identify the physical phenomena at\nplay in their very inner regions. We want to understand the disk-binary\ninteraction and to further investigate the comparison with protoplanetary\ndisks. We have conducted an interferometric snapshot survey of 23 post-AGB\nbinaries in the near-infrared (H-band) using VLTI/PIONIER. We have fitted the\nmultiwavelength visibilities and closure phases with purely geometrical models\nwith an increasing complexity in order to retrieve the sizes, temperatures and\nflux ratios of the different components All sources are resolved and the\ndifferent components contributing to the H-band flux are dissected. The\nenvironment of these targets is very complex: 13/23 targets need models with\nthirteen or more parameters to fit the data. We find that the inner disk rims\nfollow and extend the size-luminosity relation established for disks around\nyoung stars with an offset toward larger sizes. The measured temperature of the\nnear-infrared circumstellar emission of post-AGB binaries is lower (Tsub~1200K)\nthan for young stars, probably due to a different dust mineralogy and/or gas\ndensity in the dust sublimation region. The dusty inner rims of the\ncircumbinary disks around post-AGB binaries are ruled by dust sublimation\nphysics. Additionally, a significant amount of the circumstellar H-band flux is\nover-resolved (14 targets have more than 10% of their non-stellar flux\nover-resolved) hinting for more structure from a yet unknown origin (disk\nstructure or outflow). The amount of over-resolved flux is larger than around\nyoung stars. Due to the complexity of these targets, interferometric imaging is\na necessary tool to reveal the interacting inner regions in a model-independent\nway.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 08:12:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

But the proxy variables has\nbeen proved to be unreliable, because of the bias it may induce. In this paper,\nwe try to \"recover\" the unobserved confounders for the Granger causality. We\nuse a generative model with latent variable to build the relationship between\nthe unobserved confounders and the observed variables(tested variable and the\nproxy variables). The posterior distribution of the latent variable is adopted\nto represent the confounders distribution, which can be sampled to get the\nestimated confounders. We adopt the variational autoencoder to estimate the\nintractable posterior distribution. The recurrent neural network is applied to\nbuild the temporal relationship in the data. We evaluate our method in the\nsynthetic and semi-synthetic dataset. The result shows our estimated\nconfounders has a better performance than the proxy variables in the non-linear\nGranger causality with multiple proxies in the semi-synthetic dataset. But the\nperformances of the synthetic dataset and the different noise level of proxy\nseem terrible. Any advice can really help.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 08:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

Most of the\nadvanced algorithms follow the design principle that expands and constrains the\nseed regions from class activation maps (CAM). As well-known, conventional CAM\ntends to be incomplete or over-activated due to weak supervision. Fortunately,\nwe find that semantic segmentation has a characteristic of spatial\ntransformation equivariance, which can form a few self-supervisions to help\nweakly supervised learning. This work mainly explores the advantages of scale\nequivariant constrains for CAM generation, formulated as a self-supervised\nscale equivariant network (SSENet). Specifically, a novel scale equivariant\nregularization is elaborately designed to ensure consistency of CAMs from the\nsame input image with different resolutions. This novel scale equivariant\nregularization can guide the whole network to learn more accurate class\nactivation. This regularized CAM can be embedded in most recent advanced weakly\nsupervised semantic segmentation framework. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC\n2012 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance both quantitatively and qualitatively for weakly supervised\nsemantic segmentation.

Most theories for coronal heating postulate that free\nenergy in the form of magnetic twist/stress is injected by the photosphere into\nthe corona where the free energy is converted into heat either through\nreconnection or wave dissipation. The magnetic helicity associated with the\ntwist/stress, however, is expected to be conserved and appear in the corona. In\nprevious work we showed that helicity associated with the small-scale twists\nundergoes an inverse cascade via stochastic reconnection in the corona, and\nends up as the observed large-scale shear of filament channels. Our ``helicity\ncondensation'' model accounts for both the formation of filament channels and\nthe observed smooth, laminar structure of coronal loops. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate, using helicity- and energy-conserving numerical simulations of a\ncoronal system driven by photospheric motions, that the model also provides a\nnatural mechanism for heating the corona. We show that the heat generated by\nthe reconnection responsible for the helicity condensation process is\nsufficient to account for the observed coronal heating. We study the role that\nhelicity injection plays in determining coronal heating and find that,\ncrucially, the heating rate is only weakly dependent on the net helicity\npreference of the photospheric driving. Our calculations demonstrate that\nmotions with 100\\% helicity preference are least efficient at heating the\ncorona; those with 0\\% preference are most efficient. We discuss the physical\norigins of this result and its implications for the observed corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 11:22:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

We aim to connect the evolution of cores and filaments\nin G202.3+2.5 with the global evolution of the cloud and to identify the\nengines of the cloud dynamics. In this first paper, the star formation activity\nis evaluated by surveying the distributions of dense cores and protostars, and\ntheir evolutionary state, as characterised using both infrared observations\nfrom the Herschel and WISE telescopes and molecular line observations with the\nIRAM 30-m telescope. We find ongoing star formation in the whole cloud, with a\nlocal peak in star formation activity around the centre of G202.3+2.5 where a\nchain of massive cores (10-50 Msun) forms a massive ridge (>150 Msun). All\nevolutionary stages from starless cores to Class II protostars are found in\nG202.3+2.5, including a possibly starless, large column density (8x10^{22}\ncm-2), and massive (52 Msun) core. All the core-scale observables examined in\nthis paper point to an enhanced star formation activity centred on the junction\nbetween the three main branches of the ramified structure of G202.3+2.5. This\nsuggests that the increased star-formation activity results from the\nconvergence of these branches. To further investigate the origin of this\nenhancement, it is now necessary to extend the analysis to larger scales, in\norder to examine the relationship between cores, filaments and their\nenvironment. We address these points through the analysis of the dynamics of\nG202.3+2.5 in a joint paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 11:54:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

While the former predicts the future states\nof the object(s) manipulated by the robot, the latter constantly corrects the\nrobot's knowledge regarding the objects and their relations. Our results showed\nthat after training in a simulator, the robot can reliably predict the\nconsequences of its actions in object trajectory level and exploit its own\ninteraction experience to correct its belief about the state of the\nenvironment, enabling better predictions in partially observable environments.\nFurthermore, the trained model was transferred to the real world and verified\nin predicting trajectories of pushed interacting objects whose joint relations\nwere initially unknown. We compared BRDPN against PropNets, and showed that\nBRDPN performs consistently well. Moreover, BRDPN can adapt its physic\npredictions, since the relations can be predicted online.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 12:02:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 10:53:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 14:26:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-17"}

Designing a general\ncrowd counting algorithm applicable to a wide range of crowd images is\nchallenging, mainly due to the possibly large variation in object scales and\nthe presence of many isolated small clusters. Previous approaches based on\nconvolution operations with multi-branch architecture are effective for only\nsome narrow bands of scales and have not captured the long-range contextual\nrelationship due to isolated clustering. To address that, we propose SACANet, a\nnovel scale-adaptive long-range context-aware network for crowd counting.\nSACANet consists of three major modules: the pyramid contextual module which\nextracts long-range contextual information and enlarges the receptive field, a\nscale-adaptive self-attention multi-branch module to attain high scale\nsensitivity and detection accuracy of isolated clusters, and a hierarchical\nfusion module to fuse multi-level self-attention features. With group\nnormalization, SACANet achieves better optimality in the training process. We\nhave conducted extensive experiments using the VisDrone2019 People dataset, the\nVisDrone2019 Vehicle dataset, and some other challenging benchmarks.

By using laser\nfields to induce specific extra phase change to the Rydberg state during the\ngap time, it is possible to faithfully transfer the Rydberg state back to the\nground state after the gap. Although the Rydberg state transitions back and\nforth between different eigenstates during the gap time, it preserves the\nblockade interaction between the atom of interest and a nearby Rydberg\nexcitation.

The core uncertainty inside DFT theory is\nthe exchange-correlation (XC) functional, the exact form of which is still\nunknown. Therefore, the essential part of DFT success is based on the progress\nin the development of XC approximations. Traditionally, they are built upon\nanalytic solutions in low- and high-density limits and result from quantum\nMonte Carlo numerical calculations. However, there is no consistent and general\nscheme of XC interpolation and functional representation. Many different\ndeveloped parametrizations mainly utilize a number of phenomenological rules to\nconstruct a specific XC functional. In contrast, the neural network (NN)\napproach can provide a general way to parametrize an XC functional without any\na priori knowledge of its functional form. In this work, we develop NN XC\nfunctionals and prove their applicability to 3-dimensional physical systems. We\nshow that both the local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient\napproximation (GGA) are well reproduced by the NN approach. It is demonstrated\nthat the local environment can be easily considered by changing only the number\nof neurons in the first layer of the NN. The developed NN XC functionals show\ngood results when applied to systems that are not presented in the\ntraining/test data. The generalizability of the formulated NN XC framework\nleads us to believe that it could give superior results in comparison with\ntraditional XC schemes provided training data from high-level theories such as\nthe quantum Monte Carlo and post-Hartree-Fock methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 13:47:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 13:42:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

Most existing approaches have often drawn inspiration from image\nobject detection and extended the advances, e.g., SSD and Faster R-CNN, to\nproduce temporal locations of an action in a 1D sequence. Nevertheless, the\nresults can suffer from robustness problem due to the design of predetermined\ntemporal scales, which overlooks the temporal structure of an action and limits\nthe utility on detecting actions with complex variations. In this paper, we\npropose to address the problem by introducing Gaussian kernels to dynamically\noptimize temporal scale of each action proposal. Specifically, we present\nGaussian Temporal Awareness Networks (GTAN) --- a new architecture that novelly\nintegrates the exploitation of temporal structure into an one-stage action\nlocalization framework. Technically, GTAN models the temporal structure through\nlearning a set of Gaussian kernels, each for a cell in the feature maps. Each\nGaussian kernel corresponds to a particular interval of an action proposal and\na mixture of Gaussian kernels could further characterize action proposals with\nvarious length. Moreover, the values in each Gaussian curve reflect the\ncontextual contributions to the localization of an action proposal. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on both THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3 datasets, and\nsuperior results are reported when comparing to state-of-the-art approaches.\nMore remarkably, GTAN achieves 1.9% and 1.1% improvements in mAP on testing set\nof the two datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 14:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

Most VSLAM systems are feature based methods, which are\nrobust and present high accuracy, but yield sparse maps with limited\napplication for further navigation tasks. Most recently, direct methods which\noperate directly on image intensity have been introduced, capable of\nreconstructing richer maps at the cost of higher processing power. In this\nwork, an edge-based monocular SLAM system (SE-SLAM) is proposed as a middle\npoint: edges present good localization as point features, while enabling a\nstructural semidense map reconstruction. However, edges are not easy to\nassociate, track and optimize over time, as they lack descriptors and\nbiunivocal correspondence, unlike point features. To tackle these issues, this\npaper presents a method to match edges between frames in a consistent manner; a\nfeasible strategy to solve the optimization problem, since its size rapidly\nincreases when working with edges; and the use of non-linear optimization\ntechniques. The resulting system achieves comparable precision to state of the\nart feature-based and dense/semi-dense systems, while inherently building a\nstructural semi-dense reconstruction of the environment, providing relevant\nstructure data for further navigation algorithms. To achieve such accuracy,\nstate of the art non-linear optimization is needed, over a continuous feed of\n10000 edgepoints per frame, to optimize the full semi-dense output. Despite its\nheavy processing requirements, the system achieves near to real-time operation,\nthanks to a custom built solver and parallelization of its key stages. In order\nto encourage further development of edge-based SLAM systems, SE-SLAM source\ncode will be released as open source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 15:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

For a given $s$, there exist $n=2s+1$ states $|s,m\\rangle$,\n$m=s,s-1,........,-s$. A statistical assembly of particles (like a beam or\ntarget employed in experiments in physics) with the lowest value of spin\n$s=\\frac {1}{2}$ can be described in terms of probabilities $p_m$ assigned to\nthe two states $m=\\pm \\frac {1}{2}$. A generalization of this concept to higher\nspins $s>\\frac {1}{2}$ leads only to a particularly simple category of\nstatistical assemblies known as `Oriented systems'. To provide a comprehensive\ndescription of all realizable categories of statistical assemblies in\nexperiments, it is advantageous to employ the generators of the Lie group\n$SU(n)$. The probability domain then gets identified to the interior of regular\npolyhedra in $\\Re^{n-1},$ where the centre corresponds to an unpolarized\nassembly and the vertices represent `pure' states. All the other interior\npoints correspond to `mixed' states. The higher spin system has embedded within\nitself a set of $s(2s+1)$ independent axes, which are determinable empirically.\nOnly when all these axes turn out to be collinear, the simple category of\n`Oriented systems' is realized, where probabilities $p_m$ are assigned to the\nstates $|s,m\\rangle$. The simplest case of higher spin $s=1$ provides an\nillustrative example, where additional features of `aligned' and more general\n`non oriented' categories are displayed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 15:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

This may not be practical in all scenarios,\nespecially in distributed/semi-distributed networks. In this paper, incentive\nfor truthful reporting in network optimizations with local information is\nstudied. A novel general model for extending network utility maximization (NUM)\nproblems to incorporate local information is proposed, which allows each user\nto choose its own objective locally and/or privately. Two specific problems,\ni.e., a user-centric problem (UCP) and a network-centric problem (NCP), are\nstudied. In the UCP, a network center aims to maximize the collective benefit\nof all users, and truthful reporting from the users regarding their local\ninformation is necessary for finding the solution. We show that the\nwidely-adopted dual pricing cannot guarantee truthful information reporting\nfrom a user unless the resource is over-supplied or the price is too high for\nthis user to afford. In the NCP, the network center has its own objective and\npreferred solution, and incentive needs to be provided for the users to adopt\nthe solution it prefers. Truthful reporting from users is necessary for the\ncenter to determine the incentives and achieve its solution. For two-user and\nmultiuser cases, we propose two mechanisms to motivate truthful reporting from\nusers while guaranteeing nonnegative utility gains for both the users and the\ncenter. A case study on underlay D2D communication illustrates the application\nof the UCP and NCP. Simulations are conducted for the D2D application to\nvalidate the analytical results and demonstrate the proposed mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 15:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

We show that three orbitals are necessary to\nrepresent the electronic structure around the Fermi level: Ni 3dx2-y2, Nd\n5d3z2-r2, and a bonding orbital made from an interstitial s orbital in the Nd\nlayer and the Nd 5dxy orbital. By constructing a three-orbital model for these\nstates, we find that the hybridization between the Ni 3dx2-y2 state and the\nstates in the Nd layer is tiny. We also find that the metallic screening by the\nNd layer is not so effective in that it reduces the Hubbard U between the Ni\n3dx2-y2 electrons just by 10--20 %. On the other hand, the electron-phonon\ncoupling is not strong enough to mediate superconductivity of Tc ~ 10 K. These\nresults indicate that NdNiO2 hosts an almost isolated correlated 3dx2-y2\norbital system. We further study the possibility of realizing a more ideal\nsingle-orbital system in the Mott-Hubbard regime. We find that the Fermi\npockets formed by the Nd-layer states dramatically shrink when the\nhybridization between the interstitial s state and Nd 5dxy state becomes small.\nBy an extensive materials search, we find that the Fermi pockets almost\ndisappear in NaNd2NiO4 and NaCa2NiO3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 15:43:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 03:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-02"}

However, these\napproaches suffer a drastic drop in accuracy when dealing with environments\nmuch different in appearance and/or context from those observed at training\ntime. This domain shift issue is usually addressed by fine-tuning on smaller\nsets of images from the target domain annotated with depth labels.\nUnfortunately, relying on such supervised labeling is seldom feasible in most\npractical settings. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation\ntechnique which does not require groundtruth labels. Our method relies only on\nimage pairs and leverages on classical stereo algorithms to produce disparity\nmeasurements alongside with confidence estimators to assess upon their\nreliability. We propose to fine-tune both depth-from-stereo as well as\ndepth-from-mono architectures by a novel confidence-guided loss function that\nhandles the measured disparities as noisy labels weighted according to the\nestimated confidence. Extensive experimental results based on standard datasets\nand evaluation protocols prove that our technique can address effectively the\ndomain shift issue with both stereo and monocular depth prediction\narchitectures and outperforms other state-of-the-art unsupervised loss\nfunctions that may be alternatively deployed to pursue domain adaptation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 15:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

The key property of the algorithms implemented in hIPPYlib is\nthat the solution of the deterministic and linearized Bayesian inverse problem\nis computed at a cost, measured in linearized forward PDE solves, that is\nindependent of the parameter dimension. The mean of the posterior is\napproximated by the MAP point, which is found by minimizing the negative\nlog-posterior. This deterministic nonlinear least-squares optimization problem\nis solved with an inexact matrix-free Newton-CG method. The posterior\ncovariance is approximated by the inverse of the Hessian of the negative log\nposterior evaluated at the MAP point. This Gaussian approximation is exact when\nthe parameter-to-observable map is linear; otherwise, its logarithm agrees to\ntwo derivatives with the log-posterior at the MAP point, and thus it can serve\nas a proposal for Hessian-based MCMC methods.

However, 3D structures are difficult to\nretrieve at low dose and with extremely fast processing, as most techniques are\nbased on acquiring and computing hundreds of 2D angular projections. This is\neven more challenging with ultrashort X-rays which allow realizing nanometre\nscale studies and ultrafast time resolved 2D movies. Here we show that computer\nstereo vision concepts can be transposed to X-rays. We demonstrate nanoscale\nthree-dimensional reconstruction from a single ultrafast acquisition. Two\ndiffraction patterns are recorded simultaneously on a single CCD camera and\nafter phase retrieval two stereo images are reconstructed. A 3D representation\nof the sample is then computed from quantitative disparity maps with about\n130x130x380nm3 voxel resolution in a snapshot of 20 femtoseconds. We extend our\ndemonstration to phase contrast X-ray stereo imaging and reveal hidden 3D\nfeatures of a sample.

Nonlinear behavior of bubbles, and\nmost importantly 1/2 order subharmonics (SH), are used to increase the contrast\nto tissue ratio (CTR) in diagnostic ultrasound (US) and to monitor bubble\nmediated therapeutic US. It is shown experimentally and numerically that when\nbubbles are sonicated with their SH resonance frequency (fsh=2fr where fr is\nthe linear resonance frequency), SHs are generated at the lowest excitation\npressure. SHs then increase rapidly with pressure increase and reach an upper\nlimit of the achievable SH signal strength.

In this paper nonlinear\ndynamics of bubbles excited by frequencies in the range of fr<f<2fr is studied\nfor different sizes of bubbles (400nm-8 micron).

When a\nbubble is sonicated with its pressure dependent SH resonance frequency,\noscillations undergo a saddle node bifurcation from a P1 or P2 regime to a P2\noscillation regime with higher amplitude. The saddle node bifurcation is\nconcomitant with over saturation of the SH and UH amplitude and eventual\nenhancement of the upper limit of SH and UH strength (e.g. $\\approx$ 7 dB in UH\namplitude).

Significant gains in thrust can be made, however, by\ntuning the stiffness such that a resonant response is triggered, or by\nconcentrating stiffness towards the leading edge if resonance cannot be\ntriggered. To minimize power, the opposite is true. Meaningful gains in\nefficiency can be made at low frequencies by concentrating stiffness away from\nthe leading edge, since doing so induces efficient travelling wave kinematics.\nWe also speculate on the effects of a finite Reynolds number in the form of\nstreamwise drag. The drag adds an offset to the net thrust produced by the\nswimmer, causing efficiency-maximizing distributions of flexibility to tend\ntowards thrust-maximizing ones, representative of what is found in nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2019 17:32:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2020 05:41:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

While\nrobots locomoting in unstructured or confined environments face a variety of\nrisk, existing risk only focuses on collision with obstacles. Such risk is\ncurrently only addressed in ad hoc manners. Without a formal definition,\nill-supported properties, e.g. additive or Markovian, are simply assumed.\nRelied on an incomplete and inaccurate representation of risk, risk-aware\nplanners use ad hoc risk functions or chance constraints to minimize risk. The\nformer inevitably has low fidelity when modeling risk, while the latter\nconservatively generates feasible path within a probability bound. Using\npropositional logic and probability theory, the proposed motion risk reasoning\nframework is formal. Building upon a universe of risk elements of interest,\nthree major risk categories, i.e. locale-, action-, and traverse-dependent, are\nintroduced. A risk-aware planner is also developed to plan minimum risk path\nbased on the newly proposed risk framework. Results of the risk reasoning and\nplanning are validated in physical experiments in real-world unstructured or\nconfined environments. With the proposed fundamental risk reasoning framework,\nsafety of robot locomotion could be explicitly reasoned, quantified, and\ncompared. The risk-aware planner finds safe path in terms of the newly proposed\nrisk framework and enables more risk-aware robot behavior in unstructured or\nconfined environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 01:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-12"}

In this paper, we construct\ndeep neural networks with rectified power units (RePU), which can give better\napproximations for smooth functions. Optimal algorithms are proposed to\nexplicitly build neural networks with sparsely connected RePUs, which we call\nPowerNets, to represent polynomials with no approximation error.

The second is to\nestimate a point at which additional contributions of atmospheric ammonia are\nnot part of a planned expert but are the result of natural background levels.\nThese two fixes produce results that are everywhere physical. Some experiment\ntypes, such as surface broadcast, are not well cast in the Ryden and McNeil\nscheme, and lead to over-estimates of atmospheric ammonia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 02:14:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-20"}

Each agent is described by his production,\nconsumption, stock of capital, as well as the position he occupies in this\nabstract space. Each agent produces one differentiated good whose price is\nfixed by market clearing conditions. Production functions are Cobb-Douglas, and\ncapital stocks follow the standard capital accumulation dynamic equation.\nAgents consume all goods but have a preference for goods produced by their\nclosest neighbors. Agents in the exchange space are subject both to attractive\nand repulsive forces. Exchanges drive agents closer, but beyond a certain level\nof proximity, agents will tend to crowd out more distant agents. The present\nmodel uses a formalism based on statistical field theory developed earlier by\nthe authors. This approach allows the analytical treatment of economic models\nwith an arbitrary number of agents, while preserving the system's interactions\nand complexity at the individual level. Our results show that the dynamics of\ncapital accumulation and agents' position in the exchange space are correlated.\nInteractions in the exchange space induce several phases of the system. A first\nphase appears when attractive forces are limited. In this phase, an initial\ncentral position in the exchange space favors capital accumulation in average\nand leads to a higher level of capital, while agents far from the center will\nexperience a slower accumulation process. A high level of initial capital\ndrives agents towards a central position, i.e. improve the terms of their\nexchanges: they experience a higher demand and higher prices for their product.\nAs usual, high capital productivity favors capital accumulation, while higher\nrates of capital depreciation reduce capital stock. In a second phase,\nattractive forces are predominant. The previous results remain, but an\nadditional threshold effect appears. Even though no restriction was imposed\ninitially on the system, two types of agents emerge, depending on their initial\nstock of capital. One type of agents will remain above the capital threshold\nand occupy and benefit from a central position. The other type will remain\nbelow the threshold, will not be able to break it and will remain at the\nperiphery of the exchange space. In this phase, capital distribution is less\nhomogenous than in the first phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 08:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-26"}

This phenomenon is induced by the capillary instability due to\nthe wettability heterogeneity of the pore network and has a much smaller time\nscale as compared to the evaporation process. The capillary instability induced\nliquid refilling and bubble movement are explained in detail based on the\nanalysis of the images obtained from the visualization experiment. The\ncapillary valve effect, which hinders the movement of the gas-liquid interface\nand is induced by the sudden geometrical expansion between small and large\npores, can be suppressed by the residual liquid in the large pore. For better\nunderstanding of the capillary instability induced gas-liquid two-phase\ntransport during evaporation, a novel pore network model is developed, which\nconsiders not only the capillary and viscous forces but also the inertial\nforces that are seldom taken into account in the previous models. The pore\nnetwork modeling results are in good agreement with the experimental data,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of the developed pore network model, which\nopens up a new route for better understanding of the role of inertial forces in\ntwo-phase transport in porous media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 00:02:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 03:41:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 05:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}
