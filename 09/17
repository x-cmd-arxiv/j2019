Motivated by\napplications, we enrich this problem in two ways. First, sometimes each\nconfiguration additionally has an objective value, yielding an optimization\nproblem of finding a \"best\" decomposition under the given objective.

This paper\nstarts with the distinction between exponential and non-exponential family in\nthe sense of the scale unit of measurement. In the simplest nonlinear model\n${dy}/{dx}=y^{q}$, it is shown how typical effects such as rescaling and shift\nemerge in the nonlinear systems and affect observed data. Based on the present\nresults, the two representations, namely the $q$-exponential and the\n$q$-logarithm ones, are proposed. The former is for rescaling, the latter for\nunified understanding with a fixed scale unit. As applications of these\nrepresentations, the corresponding entropy and the general probability\nexpression for unified understanding with a fixed scale unit are presented.

The 1.2--10~keV\nenergy spectrum of the source can be approximated with an absorbed cut-off\npower law model. We detect strong, luminosity-dependent emission lines in the\n6--7 keV energy range. A narrow 6.42 keV line, observed in the sub-Eddington\nregime, is seen to evolve into a broad Fe-line profile in the super-Eddington\nregime. Other features are found at 6.67 and 6.97 keV in the Fe-line complex.\nAn asymmetric broad line profile, peaking at 6.67 keV, is possibly due to\nDoppler effects and gravitational redshift. The 1.2--79 keV broadband spectrum\nfrom NuSTAR and NICER observations at the outburst peak is well described by an\nabsorbed cut-off power law plus multiple Gaussian lines and a blackbody\ncomponent.

However, NMT systems are limited\nin translating low-resourced languages, due to the significant amount of\nparallel data that is required to learn useful mappings between languages. In\nthis work, we show how the so-called multilingual NMT can help to tackle the\nchallenges associated with low-resourced language translation. The underlying\nprinciple of multilingual NMT is to force the creation of hidden\nrepresentations of words in a shared semantic space across multiple languages,\nthus enabling a positive parameter transfer across languages. Along this\ndirection, we present multilingual translation experiments with three languages\n(English, Italian, Romanian) covering six translation directions, utilizing\nboth recurrent neural networks and transformer (or self-attentive) neural\nnetworks. We then focus on the zero-shot translation problem, that is how to\nleverage multi-lingual data in order to learn translation directions that are\nnot covered by the available training material. To this aim, we introduce our\nrecently proposed iterative self-training method, which incrementally improves\na multilingual NMT on a zero-shot direction by just relying on monolingual\ndata.

To avoid this, NIST has actively led a PQC\nstandardization effort since 2016, leveraging a large and international\nresearch community.\n  On January 31-February 1, 2019, the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) held\na workshop in Washington, D.C. to discuss research challenges associated with\nPQC migration. Entitled, \"Identifying Research Challenges in Post Quantum\nCryptography Migration and Cryptographic Agility\", participants came from three\ndistinct yet related communities: cryptographers contributing to the NIST PQC\nstandards effort, applied cryptographers with expertise in creating\ncryptographic solutions and implementing cryptography in real-world settings,\nand industry practitioners with expertise in deploying cryptographic standards\nwithin products and compute infrastructures. Discussion centered around two key\nthemes: identifying constituent challenges in PQC migration and imagining a new\nscience of \"cryptographic agility\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 17:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}

In particular, the high electron densities in the\nrange $10^{12} - 10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$ are consistent with those derived from the\nSDO's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager white-light observations. The presence\nof such high densities in solar eruptive flares supports the loop\ninterpretation of the optical continuum emission of stars which manifest\nsuperflares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 17:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

We model the dynamical\nevolution of a binary at the time of the second SN explosion with an equation\nof motion that accounts for the finite timescales of the SN mass loss and the\nSN natal kick. From the dynamical evolution of the binary, we calculate the GW\nburst signals associated with the SN natal kicks. We find that such GW bursts\nmay be of interest to future mid-band GW detectors like DECIGO. We also find\nthat the energy radiated away from the GWs emitted due to the SN mass loss and\nnatal kick may be a significant fraction, ${\\gtrsim}10\\%$, of the post-SN\nbinary's orbital energy. For unbound post-SN binaries, the energy radiated away\nin GWs tends to be higher than that of bound binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

We\nshow that EGCG does not bind to protein in fibrils, neither does it\naffect/prevent the pro-amyloid conversion of monomers. EGCG hinders the\naddition of monomers to growing fibrils. These facts allowed us to propose\nkinetics model for EGCG-controlled amyloid aggregation of micellar proteins.\nTherein, we introduced the growth-rate inhibition function which quantitatively\naccounts for the effect of EGCG on the fibril growth at any degree of thermal\nstress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 18:08:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 07:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

With this motivation, in this work\nwe report the first experimental investigation of spin transport across InSb\nNWs, which are enabled by devices with ferromagnetic (FM) contacts. We observe\nsignatures of spin polarization and spin-dependent transport in the\nquasi-one-dimensional ballistic regime. Moreover, we show that electrostatic\ngating tunes the observed magnetic signal and also reveals a transport regime\nwhere the device acts as a spin filter. These results open an avenue towards\ndeveloping MZM devices in which spin degeneracy is lifted locally, without the\nneed of an applied magnetic field. They also provide a path for realizing\nspin-based devices that leverage spin-orbital states in quantum wires.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 18:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}

In this paper,\nwe propose two contributions: (i) we illustrate the severity of the problem by\nlisting six vulnerabilities of blockchain consensus including two new\ncounter-examples; (ii) we then formally verify two Byzantine fault tolerant\ncomponents of Red Belly Blockchain using the ByMC model checker. First, we\nspecify a simple broadcast primitive in 116 lines of code that is verified in\n40 seconds on a 2-core Intel machine. Then, we specify a blockchain consensus\nalgorithm in 276 lines of code that is verified in 17 minutes on a 64-core AMD\nmachine using MPI. To conclude, we argue that it has now become both relatively\nsimple and crucial to formally verify the correctness of blockchain consensus\nprotocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 19:47:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 18:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

We show the applicability of using tapering measurements on\nclinically acquired data by quantifying the reproducibility of the tapering\nmeasure. Methods: We generate a spline from the centreline of an airway to\nmeasure the area and arclength at contiguous intervals. The tapering\nmeasurement is the gradient of the linear regression between area in log space\nand arclength. The reproducibility of the measure was assessed by analysing\ndifferent radiation doses, voxel sizes and reconstruction kernel on single\ntimepoint and longitudinal CT scans and by evaluating the effct of airway\nbifurcations. Results: Using 74 airways from 10 CT scans, we show a statistical\ndifference, p = 3.4 $\\times$ 10$^{-4}$ in tapering between healthy airways (n =\n35) and those affected by bronchiectasis (n = 39). The difference between the\nmean of the two populations was 0.011mm$^{-1}$ and the difference between the\nmedians of the two populations was 0.006mm$^{-1}$. The tapering measurement\nretained a 95\\% confidence interval of $\\pm$0.005mm$^{-1}$ in a simulated 25\nmAs scan and retained a 95% confidence of $\\pm$0.005mm$^{-1}$ on simulated CTs\nup to 1.5 times the original voxel size. Conclusion: We have established an\nestimate of the precision of the tapering measurement and estimated the effect\non precision of simulated voxel size and CT scan dose.

Multicycle\nTHz-radiation can be generated by shooting an appropriate laser through a\nperiodically poled nonlinear crystal, e.g. lithium niobate (PPLN).\nUnfortunately, the manufacturing processes of PPLNs require substantially\nstrong electric fields $\\mathcal{O}(10~kV/mm)$ across the crystal width to\nlocally reverse the polarization domains; this limits the crystal apertures to\nbelow 1 cm. Damage threshold limitations of lithium niobate thereby limits the\nlaser power which can be shone onto the crystal, which inherently limits the\nproduction of high-power THz pulses. Here we show that in the THz regime, a\nPPLN crystal can be mechanically constructed in-air by stacking lithium niobate\nwafers together with 180$^{\\circ}$ rotations to each other. The relatively long\n(mm) wavelengths of the generated THz radiation compared to the small gaps\n($\\sim$10 $\\mu$m) between wafers supports a near-ideal THz transmission between\nwafers.

Accurate and automatic segmentation of\nthese pulmonary lobes from computed tomography (CT) images is of clinical\nimportance for lung disease assessment and treatment planning. However, this\ntask is challenging due to ambiguous lobar boundaries, anatomical variations\nand pathological deformations. In this paper, we propose a high-resolution and\nefficient 3D fully convolutional network to automatically segment the lobes. We\nrefer to the network as Pulmonary Lobe Segmentation Network (PLS-Net), which is\ndesigned to efficiently exploit 3D spatial and contextual information from\nhigh-resolution volumetric CT images for effective volume-to-volume learning\nand inference. The PLS-Net is based on an asymmetric encoder-decoder\narchitecture with three novel components: (i) 3D depthwise separable\nconvolutions to improve the network efficiency by factorising each regular 3D\nconvolution into two simpler operations; (ii) dilated residual dense blocks to\nefficiently expand the receptive field of the network and aggregate multi-scale\ncontextual information for segmentation; and (iii) input reinforcement at each\ndownsampled resolution to compensate for the loss of spatial information due to\nconvolutional and downsampling operations. We evaluated the proposed PLS-Net on\na multi-institutional dataset that consists of 210 CT images acquired from\npatients with a wide range of lung abnormalities. Experimental results show\nthat our PLS-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with better\ncomputational efficiency.

Unlike a fully\nconnected DNN (F-DNN), which computes the utility value of an alternative k by\nusing the attributes of all the alternatives, ASU-DNN computes it by using only\nk's own attributes. Theoretically, ASU-DNN can dramatically reduce the\nestimation error of F-DNN because of its lighter architecture and sparser\nconnectivity.

After\nall, weights of recurrent connections in the brain are also not assumed to be\nrandomly chosen. Rather, these weights were probably optimized during\nevolution, development, and prior learning experiences for specific task\ndomains. In order to examine the benefits of choosing recurrent weights within\na liquid with a purpose, we applied the Learning-to-Learn (L2L) paradigm to our\nmodel: We optimized the weights of the recurrent connections -- and hence the\ndynamics of the liquid state machine -- for a large family of potential\nlearning tasks, which the network might have to learn later through\nmodification of the weights of readout neurons. We found that this two-tiered\nprocess substantially improves the learning speed of liquid state machines for\nspecific tasks. In fact, this learning speed increases further if one does not\ntrain the weights of linear readouts at all, and relies instead on the internal\ndynamics and fading memory of the network for remembering salient information\nthat it could extract from preceding examples for the current learning task.\nThis second type of learning has recently been proposed to underlie fast\nlearning in the prefrontal cortex and motor cortex, and hence it is of interest\nto explore its performance also in models.

These\nadversarial examples are created by applying adversarial perturbations to input\nsamples, which would cause them to be misclassified by the target models.\nAttacks that search and apply the perturbations to create adversarial examples\nare performed in both white-box and black-box settings, depending on the\ninformation available to the attacker about the target. For black-box attacks,\nthe only capability available to the attacker is the ability to query the\ntarget with specially crafted inputs and observing the labels returned by the\nmodel. Current black-box attacks either have low success rates, requires a high\nnumber of queries, or produce adversarial examples that are easily\ndistinguishable from their sources. In this paper, we present AdversarialPSO, a\nblack-box attack that uses fewer queries to create adversarial examples with\nhigh success rates. AdversarialPSO is based on the evolutionary search\nalgorithm Particle Swarm Optimization, a populationbased gradient-free\noptimization algorithm. It is flexible in balancing the number of queries\nsubmitted to the target vs the quality of imperceptible adversarial examples.\nThe attack has been evaluated using the image classification benchmark datasets\nCIFAR-10, MNIST, and Imagenet, achieving success rates of 99.6%, 96.3%, and\n82.0%, respectively, while submitting substantially fewer queries than the\nstate-of-the-art.

We represent the past\ntrajectories of agents using binary 2-D grids, and the underlying scene as a\nRGB birds-eye view (BEV) image, with an agent-centric frame of reference. We\nencode the scene and past trajectories using convolutional layers and generate\ntrajectory forecasts using a Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) decoder. Results on\nthe publicly available Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD) show that our model\noutperforms prior approaches and outputs realistic future trajectories that\ncomply with scene structure and past motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 22:33:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

Unassisted folding occurs by the kinetic\npartitioning mechanism according to which folding to the native state, with low\nprobability as well as misfolding to one of the many metastable states, with\nhigh probability, occur rapidly on similar time scales. GroEL is an all-purpose\nstochastic machine that assists misfolded substrate proteins (SPs) to fold. The\nRNA chaperones (CYT-19) help the folding of ribozymes that readily misfold.\nGroEL does not interact with the folded proteins but CYT-19 disrupts both the\nfolded and misfolded ribozymes. Despite this major difference, the Iterative\nAnnealing Mechanism (IAM) quantitatively explains all the available\nexperimental data for assisted folding of proteins and ribozymes. Driven by ATP\nbinding and hydrolysis and GroES binding, GroEL undergoes a catalytic cycle\nduring which it samples three allosteric states, referred to as T (apo), R (ATP\nbound), and R'' (ADP bound). In accord with the IAM predictions, analyses of\nthe experimental data shows that the efficiency of the GroEL-GroES machinery\nand mutants is determined by the resetting rate $k_{R''\\rightarrow T}$, which\nis largest for the wild type GroEL. Generalized IAM accurately predicts the\nfolding kinetics of Tetrahymena ribozyme and its variants. Chaperones maximize\nthe product of the folding rate and the steady state native state fold by\ndriving the substrates out of equilibrium. Neither the absolute yield nor the\nfolding rate is optimized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 22:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

We demonstrate that this mechanism can be used to identify the formation\nepoch of the Galactic bar, using an N-body/hydrodynamics simulation of an\nisolated Milky Way-like galaxy. As shown in many previous literature, our\nsimulation shows that the bar formation triggers an intense star formation for\n~1 Gyr in the central region, and forms a NSD. As a result, the oldest age\nlimit of the NSD is relatively sharp, and the oldest population becomes similar\nto the age of the bar. Therefore, the age distribution of the NSD tells us the\nformation epoch of the bar. We discuss that a major challenge in measuring the\nage distribution of the NSD in the Milky Way is contamination from other\nnon-negligible stellar components in the central region, such as a classical\nbulge component. We demonstrate that because the NSD is kinematically colder\nthan the other stellar populations in the Galactic central region, the NSD\npopulation can be kinematically distinguished from the other stellar\npopulations, if the 3D velocity of tracer stars are accurately measured. Hence,\nin addition to the line-of-sight velocities from spectroscopic surveys, the\naccurate measurements of the transverse velocities of stars are necessary, and\nhence the near-infrared space astrometry mission, JASMINE, would play a crutial\nrole to identify the formation epoch of the Galactic bar.

We introduce a multiclass\nclassification model for growth trajectory that flexibly extends a current\nclassification approach called the broken stick model, which is a piecewise\nlinear model with breaks at fixed knot locations.

Therefore, it is necessary to consider the illumination\ndistribution of the target area for UAV deployment optimization. This problem\nis formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the total\ntransmit power while meeting the illumination and communication requirements of\nusers. To solve this problem, an algorithm based on the machine learning\nframework of gated recurrent units (GRUs) is proposed.

The mass accretion rate decreases with decreasing radius in the\ndisk with outflows, and the rate of the gas swallowed by the BH is always\nlimited to $\\dot{m}_{\\rm in}\\sim 1.78-1.91$ even if the mass accretion rate at\nthe outer edge of the disk is very high. This may set constraints on the\nmassive BH growth through accretion in the early Universe. Due to the presence\nof outflows, there is an upper limit on the radiation flux of the disk, which\nleads to saturation of the continuum spectra of the disk with outflows at the\nhigh energy band. This may be tested by the observations of quasars or/and BH\nX-ray binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 02:48:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

In the regime of supercritical accretion,\nstrong radiation will power a massive wind that is optically thick and nearly\nspherical, and will occult the central hard X-rays from irradiating the outer\ndisk. Instead, thermal emission from the wind will act as a new source of\nirradiation. Here, we construct a self-irradiation model, in which the inner\ndisk (within the wind photosphere) is completely blocked by the wind, the\nmiddle part (between the wind photosphere and scattersphere) is heated by the\nwind directly, and the outer disk (beyond the wind scattersphere) is heated by\nphotons leaving the scattersphere. The model can adequately fit the UV/optical\nSED of NGC 247 X-1, a candidate source with supercritical accretion, while the\nstandard irradiation model fails to produce a self-consistent result. The\nbest-fit parameters suggest that the source contains a stellar mass black hole\nwith an accretion rate roughly 100 times the critical value. Remarkably, the\nUV/optical fitting predicts a wind photosphere that is well consistent with\nX-ray measurements, although it is an extrapolation over 3 orders of magnitude\nin wavelength. This implies that supercritical accretion does power a massive\nwind and the UV/optical data are useful in constraining the wind structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 03:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

We show that modes which capture true\nunderlying phenomena produce subsequent modes at higher harmonics, up until the\nNyquist limit, whose modal structure scales decrease proportionally with\nincreasing modal frequency. These higher harmonics primarily encode motion\ninformation and may or may not capture additional structural information, which\nis dependent on the system. We demonstrate these findings first on canonical\nliquid injection systems to enhance the interpretation and understanding of\nresults extracted from practical jet in crossflow systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 03:52:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

Many\nalgorithms now exist for predicting missing links, given a partially observed\nnetwork, but it has remained unknown whether a single best predictor exists,\nhow link predictability varies across methods and networks from different\ndomains, and how close to optimality current methods are. We answer these\nquestions by systematically evaluating 203 individual link predictor\nalgorithms, representing three popular families of methods, applied to a large\ncorpus of 548 structurally diverse networks from six scientific domains. We\nfirst show that individual algorithms exhibit a broad diversity of prediction\nerrors, such that no one predictor or family is best, or worst, across all\nrealistic inputs. We then exploit this diversity via meta-learning to construct\na series of \"stacked\" models that combine predictors into a single algorithm.\nApplied to a broad range of synthetic networks, for which we may analytically\ncalculate optimal performance, these stacked models achieve optimal or nearly\noptimal levels of accuracy. Applied to real-world networks, stacked models are\nalso superior, but their accuracy varies strongly by domain, suggesting that\nlink prediction may be fundamentally easier in social networks than in\nbiological or technological networks. These results indicate that the\nstate-of-the-art for link prediction comes from combining individual\nalgorithms, which achieves nearly optimal predictions.

Although multiple paths can be generated in real-time with\npolynomial curves, the generated paths are not flexible enough to deal with\ncomplex road scenes such as S-shaped road and unstructured scenes such as\nparking lots. Search and sampling-based methods, such as A* and RRT and their\nderived methods, are flexible in generating paths for these complex road\nenvironments. However, the existing algorithms require significant time to plan\nto multiple targets, which greatly limits their application in autonomous\ndriving. In this paper, a real-time path planning method for multi-targets is\nproposed. We train a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) to predict a path\nregion for the target at first. By taking the predicted path region as soft\nconstraints, the A* algorithm is then applied to search the exact path to the\ntarget. Experiments show that FCN can make multiple predictions in a very short\ntime (50 times in 40ms), and the predicted path region effectively restrict the\nsearching space for the following A* search. Therefore, the A* can search much\nfaster so that the multi-target path planning can be achieved in real-time (3\ntargets in less than 100ms).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 04:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

To improve the scale invariance of feature representation,\nrecent works extensively employ Convolutional Neural Networks with multi-column\nstructures to handle different scales and resolutions. However, due to the\nsubstantial redundant parameters in columns, existing multi-column networks\ninvariably exhibit almost the same scale features in different columns, which\nseverely affects counting accuracy and leads to overfitting. In this paper, we\nattack this problem by proposing a novel Multi-column Mutual Learning (McML)\nstrategy. It has two main innovations: 1) A statistical network is incorporated\ninto the multi-column framework to estimate the mutual information between\ncolumns, which can approximately indicate the scale correlation between\nfeatures from different columns. By minimizing the mutual information, each\ncolumn is guided to learn features with different image scales. 2) We devise a\nmutual learning scheme that can alternately optimize each column while keeping\nthe other columns fixed on each mini-batch training data. With such\nasynchronous parameter update process, each column is inclined to learn\ndifferent feature representation from others, which can efficiently reduce the\nparameter redundancy and improve generalization ability. More remarkably, McML\ncan be applied to all existing multi-column networks and is end-to-end\ntrainable.

By\nsynthesizing virtual unseen visual features, GAN-based methods convert the\nchallenging ZSL task into a supervised learning problem. However, GAN-based ZSL\nmethods have to train the generator on the seen categories and further apply it\nto unseen instances. An inevitable issue of such a paradigm is that the\nsynthesized unseen features are prone to seen references and incapable to\nreflect the novelty and diversity of real unseen instances. In a nutshell, the\nsynthesized features are confusing. One cannot tell unseen categories from seen\nones using the synthesized features. As a result, the synthesized features are\ntoo subtle to be classified in generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) which\ninvolves both seen and unseen categories at the test stage. In this paper, we\nfirst introduce the feature confusion issue. Then, we propose a new feature\ngenerating network, named alleviating feature confusion GAN (AFC-GAN), to\nchallenge the issue. Specifically, we present a boundary loss which maximizes\nthe decision boundary of seen categories and unseen ones. Furthermore, a novel\nmetric named feature confusion score (FCS) is proposed to quantify the feature\nconfusion.

Recently, adversarial training have been successfully\napplied to domain adaptation and achieved state-of-the-art performance.\nHowever, there is still a fatal weakness existing in current adversarial models\nwhich is raised from the equilibrium challenge of adversarial training.\nSpecifically, although most of existing methods are able to confuse the domain\ndiscriminator, they cannot guarantee that the source domain and target domain\nare sufficiently similar. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named {\\it\ncycle-consistent conditional adversarial transfer networks} (3CATN) to handle\nthis issue.

Specifically, we condition the adversarial networks with\nthe cross-covariance of learned features and classifier predictions to capture\nthe multimodal structures of data distributions. However, since the classifier\npredictions are not certainty information, a strong condition with the\npredictions is risky when the predictions are not accurate. We, therefore,\nfurther propose that the truly domain-invariant features should be able to be\ntranslated from one domain to the other. To this end, we introduce two feature\ntranslation losses and one cycle-consistent loss into the conditional\nadversarial domain adaptation networks.

Fault-tolerant\nschemes that not only have low qubit overhead but also comply with geometrical\ninteraction constraints are therefore necessary. In this work, we combine flag\nfault tolerance with quantum circuit mapping, to enable an efficient\nflag-bridge approach to implement FT QEC on near-term devices.

Focusing on the\nquasi-static part of the bed, the small particles are observed to segregate as\na layer of constant thickness at a velocity constant in time and independent of\nthe number of small particles. The segregation velocity is observed to be\ndirectly linked to the inertial number at the bottom of the layer, and to\nincrease linearly with the size ratio. While the macroscopic behavior is\nindependent of the concentration in small particles, an analysis in the\nframework of the continuous model of (Thornton et al. 2006) shows that the\ndynamics results from an equilibrium between the influence of the local\nconcentration and the inertial number forcing.

Unsurprisingly, it is notably more difficult to reliably\nrepresentthe sparser regions of such multivariate distributions and in\nparticular combinations of attributes which are absent from the original\nsample. In the literature this is commonly known as sampling zeros for which no\nsystematic solution has been proposed so far. In this paper, two machine\nlearning algorithms, from the family of deep generative models,are proposed for\nthe problem of population synthesis and with particular attention to the\nproblem of sampling zeros. Specifically, we introduce the Wasserstein\nGenerative Adversarial Network (WGAN) and the Variational Autoencoder(VAE), and\nadapt these algorithms for a large-scale population synthesis application. The\nmodels are implemented on a Danish travel survey with a feature-space of more\nthan 60 variables. The models are validated in a cross-validation scheme and a\nset of new metrics for the evaluation of the sampling-zero problem is proposed.\nResults show how these models are able to recover sampling zeros while keeping\nthe estimation of truly impossible combinations, the structural zeros, at a\ncomparatively low level. Particularly, for a low dimensional experiment, the\nVAE, the marginal sampler and the fully random sampler generate 5%, 21% and\n26%, respectively, more structural zeros per sampling zero generated by the\nWGAN, while for a high dimensional case, these figures escalate to 44%, 2217%\nand 170440%, respectively.

Once such an embedding is\nachieved, the second step is to apply a Poisson limit theorem that allows a\ncomparison of object sizes in a critical window and therefore allows a\ndescription of features of extremal objects.

In this paper, we first consider WPT\nfrom an energy access point (E-AP) to multiple energy receivers (E-Rs) to\nobtain the optimal policy that maximizes the WPT efficiency. For this purpose,\nwe formulate the problem of maximizing the total average received power of the\nE-Rs subject to the average and peak power level constraints of the E-AP. The\nformulated problem is a non-convex stochastic optimization problem. Using some\nstochastic optimization techniques, we tackle the challenges of this problem\nand derive a closed-form expression for the optimal solution, which requires\nthe explicit knowledge of the distribution of channel state information (CSI)\nin the network. We then propose a near-optimal algorithm that does not require\nany explicit knowledge of the CSI distribution and prove that the proposed\nalgorithm attains a near-optimal solution within a guaranteed gap to the\noptimal solution. We next consider fairness among the E-Rs and propose a\nquality of service (QoS) aware fair policy that maximizes a generic network\nutility function while guaranteeing the required QoS of each E-R. Finally, we\nstudy a practical wirelessly powered communication scenario in which the E-Rs\nutilize their energy harvested through WPT to transmit information to the E-AP.\nWe optimize the received information at the E-AP under its average and peak\ntransmission power constraints and the fairness constraints of the E-Rs.\nNumerical results show the significant performance of our proposed solutions\ncompared to the state-of-the-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 10:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

The results show that\nQSMnet underestimates susceptibility in hemorrhagic lesions, revealing degraded\nlinearity of the network for the untrained susceptibility range.

The newly trained network, which\nis referred to as QSMnet+, is assessed in computer-simulated lesions with an\nextended susceptibility range (-1.4 ppm to +1.4 ppm) and also in twelve\nhemorrhagic patients. The simulation results demonstrate improved linearity of\nQSMnet+ over QSMnet (root mean square error of QSMnet+: 0.04 ppm vs. QSMnet:\n0.36 ppm). When applied to patient data, QSMnet+ maps show less noticeable\nartifacts to those of conventional QSM maps. Moreover, the susceptibility\nvalues of QSMnet+ in hemorrhagic lesions are better matched to those of the\nconventional QSM method than those of QSMnet when analyzed using linear\nregression (QSMnet+: slope = 1.05, intercept = -0.03, R2 = 0.93; QSMnet: slope\n= 0.68, intercept = 0.06, R2 = 0.86), consolidating improved linearity in\nQSMnet+.

Several\nrobust alternatives have been proposed, but there is still significant room for\nimprovement. This paper thus proposes an original method of estimation that\noffers the best efficiency simultaneously in the absence and the presence of\noutliers, both for the estimation of the regression coefficients and the scale\nparameter. The approach first consists in broadening the normal assumption of\nthe errors to a mixture of the normal and the filtered-log-Pareto (FLP), an\noriginal distribution designed to represent the outliers.

To\novercome the energy limitation without changing the size of sensors,\nresearchers have proposed the use of energy harvesting to reload the\nrechargeable battery by power. Therefore, efficient power management is\nrequired to increase the benefits of having additional environmental energy.\nThis paper presents a new self-management of energy based on Proportional\nIntegral Derivative controller (PID) to tune the energy harvesting and\nMicroprocessor Controller Unit (MCU) to control the sensor modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 12:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

It uses a sequence of\ntwo adiabatic pulses split by a phase jump serving as a control parameter. Each\npulse has a chirped detuning, which induces a half crossing, and acts as a\n$\\pi/2$ pulse in the adiabatic regime. The phase jump is imprinted onto the\npopulation ratio of the created superposition state. Of the various possible\nrelations between the two pulses, we select the case when the Rabi frequency\nand the detuning of the second pulse are mirror images of those of the first\npulse, and the two detunings have opposite signs. Then the mixing angle of the\nsuperposition state depends on the phase jump only. For other arrangements, the\nsuperposition mixing angle is shifted by the dynamic phases of the propagators,\nwhich makes these cases suitable for state tomography. This twin setup comes\nalong with the advantage that it reduces the error $\\epsilon$ of each\nindividual pulse down to $4\\epsilon^2$ overall. Therefore, the proposed\ntechnique combines the benefits of robustness stemming from adiabatic evolution\nwith accuracy generated by the twin-pulse error suppression, and flexibility of\nthe superposition state controlled by the phase jump $\\phi$. In addition, we\npresent a simple exactly soluble trigonometric model in order to illustrate the\nproposed technique. In this model, when the pulse area $A$ increases the\nnonadiabatic oscillations are damped as $A^{-1}$ for a single pulse and\n$A^{-2}$ for the two-pulse sequence. Finally, the proposed technique is\nextended to sequences of $N=2^n$ pulses by concatenating $\\pi/2$ sequences and\nsplitting them by a phase jump, thereby further reducing the nonadiabatic error\n$\\epsilon$ to $(2\\epsilon)^{N}$.

To solve this problem, we propose a global optimal path-based\nclustering (GOPC) algorithm in this paper. The GOPC algorithm is based on two\nfacts: (1) medoids have the minimum degree in their clusters; (2) the minimax\ndistance between two objects in one cluster is smaller than the minimax\ndistance between objects in different clusters. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of\nthe GOPC algorithm. The results on synthetic datasets show that the GOPC\nalgorithm can recognize all kinds of clusters regardless of their shapes,\nsizes, or densities. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of the GOPC algorithm. In addition, the GOPC\nalgorithm needs only one parameter, i.e., the number of clusters, which can be\nestimated by the decision graph. The advantages mentioned above make GOPC a\ngood candidate as a general clustering algorithm.

The robust H-infinity norm is the worst case value of the\nH-infinity norm over the realisations of the system and hence an important\nmeasure of robust performance in control engineering. However this robust\nH-infinity norm is a fragile measure, as for a particular realization of the\nuncertainties the H-infinity norm might be sensitive to arbitrarily small\nperturbations on the delays. Therefore, we introduce the robust strong\nH-infinity norm, inspired by the notion of strong stability of delay\ndifferential equations of neutral type, which takes into account both the\nperturbations on the system matrices and infinitesimal small delay\nperturbations. This quantity is a continuous function of the nominal system\nparameters and delays. The main contribution of this work is the introduction\nof a relation between this robust strong H-infinity norm and the the\npseudo-spectrum of an associated singular delay eigenvalue problem. This\nrelation is subsequently employed in a novel algorithm for computing the robust\nstrong H-infinity norm of uncertain time-delay systems.

These are large expander graphs, and the\nhard problem is to find an efficient algorithm for routing, or path-finding,\nbetween two vertices of the graph. We consider four aspects of supersingular\nisogeny graphs, study each thoroughly and, where appropriate, discuss how they\nrelate to one another.\n  First, we consider two related graphs that help us understand the structure:\nthe `spine' $\\mathcal{S}$, which is the subgraph of\n$\\mathcal{G}_\\ell(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p})$ given by the $j$-invariants in\n$\\mathbb{F}_p$, and the graph $\\mathcal{G}_\\ell(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, in which both\ncurves and isogenies must be defined over $\\mathbb{F}_p$. We show how to pass\nfrom the latter to the former. The graph $\\mathcal{S}$ is relevant for\ncryptanalysis because routing between vertices in $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is easier than\nin the full isogeny graph. The $\\mathbb{F}_p$-vertices are typically assumed to\nbe randomly distributed in the graph, which is far from true. We provide an\nanalysis of the distances of connected components of $\\mathcal{S}$.\n  Next, we study the involution on $\\mathcal{G}_\\ell(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_p})$\nthat is given by the Frobenius of $\\mathbb{F}_p$ and give heuristics on how\noften shortest paths between two conjugate $j$-invariants are preserved by this\ninvolution (mirror paths). We also study the related question of what\nproportion of conjugate $j$-invariants are $\\ell$-isogenous for $\\ell = 2,3$.\nWe conclude with experimental data on the diameters of supersingular isogeny\ngraphs when $\\ell = 2$ and compare this with previous results on diameters of\nLPS graphs and random Ramanujan graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 13:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

In this work, the raw data, collected from accelerometers\n(time-domain features) are taken as the input of a novel temporal sequence\nprediction algorithm to present an end-to-end method for fault detection. We\nuse equivalent temporal sequences as the input of a novel Convolutional\nLong-Short-Term-Memory Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) to detect the bearing\nfault with the highest accuracy in the shortest possible time. The method can\nreach the highest accuracy in the literature, to the best knowledge of the\nauthors of the present paper, voiding any sort of pre-processing or\nmanipulation of the input data. Effectiveness and feasibility of the fault\ndiagnosis method are validated by applying it to two commonly used benchmark\nreal vibration datasets and comparing the result with the other intelligent\nfault diagnosis methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 16:00:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 12:52:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 20:56:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 04:13:12 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 20:53:01 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 18:41:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

Even with increasing computational power and evolution of\nspecialized architectures, the ability to simulate protein folding at atomistic\nscales still remains challenging. This stems from the dual aspects of high\ndimensionality of protein conformational landscapes, and the inability of\natomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to sufficiently sample these\nlandscapes to observe folding events. Machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL)\ntechniques, when combined with atomistic MD simulations offer the opportunity\nto potentially overcome these limitations by: (1) effectively reducing the\ndimensionality of MD simulations to automatically build latent representations\nthat correspond to biophysically relevant reaction coordinates (RCs), and (2)\ndriving MD simulations to automatically sample potentially novel conformational\nstates based on these RCs. We examine how coupling DL approaches with MD\nsimulations can fold small proteins effectively on supercomputers. In\nparticular, we study the computational costs and effectiveness of scaling\nDL-coupled MD workflows by folding two prototypical systems, viz., Fs-peptide\nand the fast-folding variant of the villin head piece protein. We demonstrate\nthat a DL driven MD workflow is able to effectively learn latent\nrepresentations and drive adaptive simulations. Compared to traditional\nMD-based approaches, our approach achieves an effective performance gain in\nsampling the folded states by at least 2.3x. Our study provides a quantitative\nbasis to understand how DL driven MD simulations, can lead to effective\nperformance gains and reduced times to solution on supercomputing resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 13:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

Current\napproach consists of autopilot solutions that disengage themselves when they\nbecome ineffective. This may cause reengagement of the pilot at the worst\npossible time, which can result in undesired consequences. In this paper, a\nseries of research studies that propose pilot-autopilot interaction schemes\nbased on the Capacity for Maneuver (CfM) concept, are covered. CfM refers to\nthe remaining capacity of the actuators that can be used for bringing the\naircraft to safety. It is demonstrated that CfM-based pilot-autopilot\ninteraction schemes, or Shared Control Architectures (SCA), can be promising\nalternatives to the existing schemes.

This transport\ntypically leads to highly inhomogeneous distributions of entanglement.There\nexists no consistent systematic means of decomposing helicity over varying\nspatial scales and in localised regions. We apply a multiresolution wavelet\ndecomposition to the magnetic field and demonstrate how it can be applied to\nvarious quantities associated with magnetic helicity, including the field line\nhelicity. We use a geometrical definition of helicity which allows these\nquantities to be calculated for fields with arbitrary boundary conditions. It\nis shown that the multiresolution decomposition of helicity has the crucial\nproperty of local additivity and demonstrate a general linear energy-topology\nconservation law which is a significant generalisation of the two point\ncorrelation decomposition used in the analysis of homogeneous turbulence and\nperiodic fields. The localisation property of the wavelet representation is\nshown to characterise inhomogeneous distributions which a Fourier\nrepresentation cannot. Using an analytic representation of a resistive braided\nfield relaxation we demonstrate a clear correlation between the variations in\nenergy at various length scales and the variations in helicity at the same\nspatial scales.

This is an alternative to the practice of\nformulating a custom VRP for every company with its own routing requirements.\nInstead, we assume the presence of past vehicle routing solutions over similar\nsets of customers, and learn to make similar choices. The approach is based on\nthe concept of learning a first-order Markov model, which corresponds to a\nprobabilistic transition matrix, rather than a deterministic distance matrix.\nThis nevertheless allows us to use existing arc routing VRP software in\ncreating the actual route plans. For the learning, we explore different schemes\nto construct the probabilistic transition matrix. Our results on a use-case\nwith a small transportation company show that our method is able to generate\nresults that are close to the manually created solutions, without needing to\ncharacterize all constraints and sub-objectives explicitly. Even in the case of\nchanges in the client sets, our method is able to find solutions that are\ncloser to the actual route plans than when using distances, and hence,\nsolutions that would require fewer manual changes to transform into the actual\nroute plan.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 15:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

While lattices have been the main setting for these studies, a\nrelatively unexplored realm for this physics is that of continuum fluids. In\nthe typical case of a fluid model with a point spectrum, nontrivial topology\nand associated edge modes have been observed previously. However, another\npossibility is that a continuous spectrum can coexist with the point spectrum.\nHere we demonstrate that a fluid plasma model can harbor nontrivial topology\nwithin its continuous spectrum, and that there are boundary modes at the\ninterface between topologically distinct regions. We consider the ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model. In the presence of magnetic shear, we find\nnontrivial topology in the Alfv\\'{e}n continuum. For strong shear, the Chern\nnumber is $\\pm 1$, depending on the sign of the shear. If the magnetic shear\nchanges sign within the plasma, a topological phase transition occurs, and\nbulk-boundary correspondence then suggests a mode localized to the layer of\nzero magnetic shear. We confirm the existence of this mode numerically.\nMoreover, this reversed-shear Alfv\\'{e}n eigenmode (RSAE) is well known within\nmagnetic fusion as it has been observed in several tokamaks. In examining how\nthe MHD model might be regularized at small scales, we also consider the\nelectron limit of Hall MHD. We show that the whistler band, which plays an\nimportant role in planetary ionospheres, has nontrivial topology. More broadly,\nthis work raises the possibility that fusion devices could be carefully\ntailored to produce other topological states with potentially useful behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 15:55:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 05:18:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 23:27:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 01:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-18"}

In particular, in the considered\nmodel, wireless users execute an FL algorithm while training their local FL\nmodels using their own data and transmitting the trained local FL models to a\nbase station (BS) that will generate a global FL model and send it back to the\nusers. Since all training parameters are transmitted over wireless links, the\nquality of the training will be affected by wireless factors such as packet\nerrors and the availability of wireless resources. Meanwhile, due to the\nlimited wireless bandwidth, the BS must select an appropriate subset of users\nto execute the FL algorithm so as to build a global FL model accurately. This\njoint learning, wireless resource allocation, and user selection problem is\nformulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize an FL loss\nfunction that captures the performance of the FL algorithm. To address this\nproblem, a closed-form expression for the expected convergence rate of the FL\nalgorithm is first derived to quantify the impact of wireless factors on FL.\nThen, based on the expected convergence rate of the FL algorithm, the optimal\ntransmit power for each user is derived, under a given user selection and\nuplink resource block (RB) allocation scheme. Finally, the user selection and\nuplink RB allocation is optimized so as to minimize the FL loss function.\nSimulation results show that the proposed joint federated learning and\ncommunication framework can reduce the FL loss function value by up to 10% and\n16%, respectively, compared to: 1) An optimal user selection algorithm with\nrandom resource allocation and 2) a standard FL algorithm with random user\nselection and resource allocation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 02:38:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 01:15:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 01:47:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2022 22:51:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

We design a common architecture to recover sparse as well\nas block sparse vectors from single measurement vector (SMV) or multiple\nmeasurement vectors (MMV) depending on the nature of the training data. In the\nMMV model, the L-SBL network can be trained to learn any underlying sparsity\npattern among the vectors including joint sparsity, block sparsity, etc. In\nparticular, for block sparse recovery, learned-SBL does not require any prior\nknowledge of block boundaries.

We therefore propose a generalisation of\ndynamic causal modelling that incorporates both phase and amplitude. This\nallows for the separate quantifications of phase and amplitude contributions to\nthe connectivity between neural regions. We establish, using model-generated\ndata and simulations of coupled pendula, that phase-only models perform well\nonly under weak coupling conditions.

Inference attacks pose severe privacy and security\nthreats to individuals and systems. Inference attacks are successful because\nprivate data are statistically correlated with public data, and ML classifiers\ncan capture such statistical correlations. In this chapter, we discuss the\nopportunities and challenges of defending against ML-equipped inference attacks\nvia adversarial examples.

To defend against inference attacks,\nwe can add carefully crafted noise into the public data to turn them into\nadversarial examples, such that attackers' classifiers make incorrect\npredictions for the private data.

Since the source and the target\ndomains are usually from different distributions, existing methods mainly focus\non adapting the cross-domain marginal or conditional distributions. However, in\nreal applications, the marginal and conditional distributions usually have\ndifferent contributions to the domain discrepancy. Existing methods fail to\nquantitatively evaluate the different importance of these two distributions,\nwhich will result in unsatisfactory transfer performance. In this paper, we\npropose a novel concept called Dynamic Distribution Adaptation (DDA), which is\ncapable of quantitatively evaluating the relative importance of each\ndistribution.

On the basis of DDA, we\npropose two novel learning algorithms: (1) Manifold Dynamic Distribution\nAdaptation (MDDA) for traditional transfer learning, and (2) Dynamic\nDistribution Adaptation Network (DDAN) for deep transfer learning. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MDDA and DDAN significantly improve the transfer\nlearning performance and setup a strong baseline over the latest deep and\nadversarial methods on digits recognition, sentiment analysis, and image\nclassification. More importantly, it is shown that marginal and conditional\ndistributions have different contributions to the domain divergence, and our\nDDA is able to provide good quantitative evaluation of their relative\nimportance which leads to better performance.

In this paper, a reverse logistics\nnetwork for an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) is presented. Returned\nproducts are selected for remanufacturing or scrapping, based on their quality\nand proportional prices are offered to customers. A Mixed Integer Non-linear\nProgramming (MINLP) model is proposed to determine the location of collection\ncenters, the optimum price of returned products and the sorting policy. The\nrisk in the objective function is measured using the Conditional Value at Risk\n(CVaR) metric. CVaR measures the risk of an investment in a conservative way by\nconsidering the maximum lost. The results are analyzed for various values of\nthe risk parameters ({\\alpha}, and {\\lambda}). These parameters indicate that\nconsidering risk affects prices, the classification of returned products, the\nlocation of collection centers and, consequently, the objective function. The\nmodel performs more conservatively when the weight of the CVaR part ({\\lambda})\nand the value of the confidence level {\\alpha} are increased. The results show\nthat better profits are obtained when we take CVaR into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 11:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-26"}

The deficiency of samples could be effectively\nalleviated by generating samples through Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN),\nbut the generation of videos on a typical category remains to be underexplored\nsince the complex actions and the changeable viewpoints are difficult to\nsimulate. In this paper, we propose a generative data augmentation method for\ntemporal stream of the Temporal Segment Networks with the dynamic image. The\ndynamic image compresses the motion information of video into a still image,\nremoving the interference factors such as the background. Thus it is easier to\ngenerate images with categorical motion information using GAN. We use the\ngenerated dynamic images to enhance the features, with regularization achieved\nas well, thereby to achieve the effect of video augmentation. In order to deal\nwith the uneven quality of generated images, we propose a Self-Paced Selection\n(SPS) method, which automatically selects the high-quality generated samples to\nbe added to the network training. Our method is verified on two benchmark\ndatasets, HMDB51 and UCF101. The experimental results show that the method can\nimprove the accuracy of video classification under the circumstance of sample\ninsufficiency and sample imbalance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 16:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}

As a remedy, we propose a near-miss data\nsynthesizing framework based on Variational Bayesian methods and term it as\nConditional Multiple Trajectory Synthesizer (CMTS). We leverage a generative\nmodel conditioned on road maps to bridge safe and collision driving data by\nrepresenting their distribution in the latent space.

The\nsensitivity of porosity to foaming time and foaming temperature is measured.\nAlso, the microstructure of the PMMA nanofoams is characterised in terms of\ncell size and cell nucleation density. A one dimensional numerical model is\ndeveloped to predict the growth of spherical, gas-filled voids during the\nsolid-state foaming process. Diffusion of CO$_2$ within the PMMA matrix is\nsufficiently rapid for the concentration of CO$_2$ to remain almost uniform\nspatially. The foaming model makes use of experimentally calibrated\nconstitutive laws for the uniaxial stress versus strain response of the PMMA\ngrades as a function of strain rate and temperature, and the effect of\ndissolved CO$_2$ is accounted for by a shift in the glass transition\ntemperature of the PMMA. The maximum achievable porosity is interpreted in\nterms of cell wall tearing and comparisons are made between the predictions of\nthe model and nanofoaming measurements; it is deduced that the failure strain\nof the cell walls is sensitive to cell wall thickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 13:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

The prevalence of social media and web access has\nled to the emergence of social, or human sensors who report on events globally.\nThis warrants development of event detectors that can take advantage of the\ntruly dense and high spatial and temporal resolution data provided by more than\n3 billion social users. The phenomenon of concept drift, which causes terms and\nsignals associated with a topic to change over time, renders static machine\nlearning ineffective. Towards this end, we present an application for physical\nevent detection on social sensors that improves traditional physical event\ndetection with concept drift adaptation. Our approach continuously updates its\nmachine learning classifiers automatically, without the need for human\nintervention. It integrates data from heterogeneous sources and is designed to\nhandle weak-signal events (landslides, wildfires) with around ten posts per\nevent in addition to large-signal events (hurricanes, earthquakes) with\nhundreds of thousands of posts per event. We demonstrate a landslide detector\non our application that detects almost 350% more land-slides compared to static\napproaches. Our application has high performance: using classifiers trained in\n2014, achieving event detection accuracy of 0.988, compared to 0.762 for static\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 05:15:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-14"}
