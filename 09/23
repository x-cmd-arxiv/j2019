Recent advances improve stochastic algorithms on\nconvergence speed, adaptivity and structural awareness. However, distributional\naspects of these new algorithms are poorly understood, especially for\nstructured parameters. To develop statistical inference in this case, we\npropose a class of generalized regularized dual averaging (gRDA) algorithms\nwith constant step size, which improves RDA (Xiao, 2010; Flammarion and Bach,\n2017). Weak convergence of gRDA trajectories are studied, and as a consequence,\nfor the first time in the literature, the asymptotic distributions for online\nl1 penalized problems become available. These general results apply to both\nconvex and non-convex differentiable loss functions, and in particular, recover\nthe existing regret bound for convex losses (Nemirovski et al., 2009). As\nimportant applications, statistical inferential theory on online sparse linear\nregression and online sparse principal component analysis are developed, and\nare supported by extensive numerical analysis. Interestingly, when gRDA is\nproperly tuned, support recovery and central limiting distribution (with mean\nzero) hold simultaneously in the online setting, which is in contrast with the\nbiased central limiting distribution of batch Lasso (Knight and Fu, 2000).\nTechnical devices, including weak convergence of stochastic mirror descent, are\ndeveloped as by-products with independent interest. Preliminary empirical\nanalysis of modern image data shows that learning very sparse deep neural\nnetworks by gRDA does not necessarily sacrifice testing accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Sep 2019 19:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

We\nhave investigated the composite structure of the Eridanus side of the\nsuperbubble in the light of a new decomposition of the atomic and molecular\ngas. We used HI and CO emission lines to separate coherent gas shells in space\nand velocity, and we studied their relation to the warm ionised gas probed in\nH$\\alpha$ emission, to the hot plasma emitting X-rays, and to the magnetic\nfields traced by dust polarised emission. We also constrained the relative\ndistances to the clouds using dust reddening maps and X-ray absorption.

However, the\navailable theoretical description does not give an understanding of the\nphysical mechanisms underlying in the gate voltage control of quantum\nyield.This work is an attempt to propose a consistent semi-phenomenological\ntheory of photo-induced charge carriers relaxation in 2D-TMDs, which allows\nobtaining an analytical dependence of the quantum yield on the voltage applied\nto the FET gate. We consider a standard experimental situation, when the 2D-TMD\nmonolayer and the metal gate are plates of a flat capacitor, and the capacitor\ncharge is proportional to the gate voltage. The dependences of the TMD\nmonolayers quantum yield on the gate voltage and the carrier generation rate\nhave been calculated for the cases of the prevailing recombination of free\nelectrons and holes (radiative and non-radiative Auger recombination) and\nrecombination of excitons (radiative and Auger recombination). In both cases\nanalytical expressions were derived for the dependence of quantum yield on the\ngate voltage and photo-induced carriers generation rate at a fixed gate\nvoltage.

As an example, we introduce our approach on a reduced toy model with\na median voter who always votes in the majority. The sensitivity of\nmajority-minority divisions to changing voter behaviour pinpoints the unique\nrole of the median. More generally, the sensitivity identifies pivotal\ncomponents that precisely determine collective outcomes generated by a complex\nnetwork of interactions. Using perturbations to target pivotal components in\nthe models, we analyse datasets from political voting, finance and Twitter.\nAcross these systems, we find remarkable variety, from systems dominated by a\nmedian-like component to those whose components behave more equally.

In this work, we propose a new HVQR benchmark for evaluating\nexplainable and high-order visual question reasoning ability with three\ndistinguishable merits: 1) the questions often contain one or two relationship\ntriplets, which requires the model to have the ability of multistep reasoning\nto predict plausible answers; 2) we provide an explicit evaluation on a\nmultistep reasoning process that is constructed with image scene graphs and\ncommonsense knowledge bases; and 3) each relationship triplet in a large-scale\nknowledge base only appears once among all questions, which poses challenges\nfor existing networks that often attempt to overfit the knowledge base that\nalready appears in the training set and enforces the models to handle unseen\nquestions and knowledge fact usage.

An extensive dataset\nanalysis and comparisons with existing models on the HVQR benchmark show that\nour benchmark provides explainable evaluations, comprehensive reasoning\nrequirements and realistic challenges of VQA systems, as well as our KM-net's\nsuperiority in terms of accuracy and explanation ability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 02:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

While effective for relatively short-term time\nintegration, when long time integration of the time-dependent PDEs is sought,\nthe time-space domain may become arbitrarily large and hence training of the\nneural network may become prohibitively expensive. To this end, we develop a\nparareal physics-informed neural network (PPINN), hence decomposing a long-time\nproblem into many independent short-time problems supervised by an\ninexpensive/fast coarse-grained (CG) solver. In particular, the serial CG\nsolver is designed to provide approximate predictions of the solution at\ndiscrete times, while initiate many fine PINNs simultaneously to correct the\nsolution iteratively. There is a two-fold benefit from training PINNs with\nsmall-data sets rather than working on a large-data set directly, i.e.,\ntraining of individual PINNs with small-data is much faster, while training the\nfine PINNs can be readily parallelized. Consequently, compared to the original\nPINN approach, the proposed PPINN approach may achieve a significant speedup\nfor long-time integration of PDEs, assuming that the CG solver is fast and can\nprovide reasonable predictions of the solution, hence aiding the PPINN solution\nto converge in just a few iterations. To investigate the PPINN performance on\nsolving time-dependent PDEs, we first apply the PPINN to solve the Burgers\nequation, and subsequently we apply the PPINN to solve a two-dimensional\nnonlinear diffusion-reaction equation. Our results demonstrate that PPINNs\nconverge in a couple of iterations with significant speed-ups proportional to\nthe number of time-subdomains employed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 03:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Recent works show that adversarially\ntrained models are more biased towards global structure features. Instead, in\nthis work, we would like to investigate the relationship between the\ngeneralization of adversarial training and the robust local features, as the\nrobust local features generalize well for unseen shape variation. To learn the\nrobust local features, we develop a Random Block Shuffle (RBS) transformation\nto break up the global structure features on normal adversarial examples. We\ncontinue to propose a new approach called Robust Local Features for Adversarial\nTraining (RLFAT), which first learns the robust local features by adversarial\ntraining on the RBS-transformed adversarial examples, and then transfers the\nrobust local features into the training of normal adversarial examples. To\ndemonstrate the generality of our argument, we implement RLFAT in currently\nstate-of-the-art adversarial training frameworks. Extensive experiments on\nSTL-10, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that RLFAT significantly improves both the\nadversarially robust generalization and the standard generalization of\nadversarial training.

This is also the\nregime required for non-local collisonless (stochastic) heating in oscillating\nand spatially inhomogeneous electric fields. Solution of the Boltzmann equation\nunder these conditions requires usually computationally involving\nmulti-dimensional PIC/MC simulations. The necessity of multi-dimensional\nsimulation arises mainly from the complicated time and space dependence of the\ncollisionless electron heating process. Here it is shown that a time, volume,\nund solid angle averaged Fokker-Planck operator for the interaction of\nelectrons with an external field can replace the local Ohmic heating operator\nresulting from a two-term approximation of the Boltzmann equation. This allows\nconsistent treatment of collisional as well as collisonless heating.

The new\noperators are relatively easy to integrate in classical local Boltzmann solvers\nand allow for a fast calculation of the distribution function. As an example,\nan operator describing non-local collisionless as well as collisional heating\nin inductively coupled plasmas (ICPs) is derived. The resulting distribution\nfunction can then be used to calculate rates and moments in a fluid model of\nthe plasma, similarly to the common practice in the local and highly\ncollisional case.

One solution is to retrieve images with known pose from a database for\nthe localization of query images. However, in environments with drastically\nvarying conditions (e.g. illumination changes, seasons, occlusion, dynamic\nobjects), retrieval-based localization is severely hampered and becomes a\nchallenging problem. In this paper, a novel domain-invariant feature learning\nmethod (DIFL) is proposed based on ComboGAN, a multi-domain image translation\nnetwork architecture. By introducing a feature consistency loss (FCL) between\nthe encoded features of the original image and translated image in another\ndomain, we are able to train the encoders to generate domain-invariant features\nin a self-supervised manner. To retrieve a target image from the database, the\nquery image is first encoded using the encoder belonging to the query domain to\nobtain a domain-invariant feature vector. We then preform retrieval by\nselecting the database image with the most similar domain-invariant feature\nvector. We validate the proposed approach on the CMU-Seasons dataset, where we\noutperform state-of-the-art learning-based descriptors in retrieval-based\nlocalization for high and medium precision scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 06:47:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

Utilising the 2D Bayesian light profile fitting code\nProFit, we fit single- and double-component models taking advantage of a robust\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo optimisation algorithm in which we assume a Sersic\nprofile for single-component models and a combination of a Sersic bulge and\nnear-exponential disc (0.5 < n < 1.5) for double-component models. We\ninvestigate the effect of bulges on the atomic hydrogen (HI) content in\ngalaxies by revisiting the HI-to-stellar mass scaling relations with the\nbulge-to-total ratio measured in the ProFit decompositions. We show that, at\nboth fixed total and disc stellar mass, more bulge-dominated galaxies have\nsystematically lower HI masses, implying that bulge-dominated galaxies with\nlarge HI reservoirs are rare in the local Universe. We see similar trends when\nseparating galaxies by a bulge-to-total ratio based either on luminosity or\nstellar mass, however, the trends are more evident with luminosity.\nImportantly, when controlling for both stellar mass and star formation rate,\nthe separation of atomic gas content reduces to within 0.3 dex between galaxies\nof different bulge-to-total ratios. Our findings suggest that the presence of a\nphotometric bulge has little effect on the global HI gas reservoirs of local\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 07:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

Recovering the manifold requires the noise to be of\ncertain concentration. Existing methods address this problem by constructing an\napproximated manifold based on the tangent space estimation at each sample\npoint. Although theoretical convergence for these methods is guaranteed, either\nthe samples are noiseless or the noise is bounded. However, if the noise is\nunbounded, which is a common scenario, the tangent space estimation at the\nnoisy samples will be blurred. Fitting a manifold from the blurred tangent\nspace might increase the inaccuracy. In this paper, we introduce a new\nmanifold-fitting method, by which the output manifold is constructed by\ndirectly estimating the tangent spaces at the projected points on the\nunderlying manifold, rather than at the sample points, to decrease the error\ncaused by the noise. Assuming the noise is unbounded, our new method provides\ntheoretical convergence in high probability, in terms of the upper bound of the\ndistance between the estimated and underlying manifold. The smoothness of the\nestimated manifold is also evaluated by bounding the supremum of twice\ndifference above. Numerical simulations are provided to validate our\ntheoretical findings and demonstrate the advantages of our method over other\nrelevant manifold fitting methods.

However, it also has one well-established\nfailing since it can lead to portfolios that are not optimal from a financial\npoint of view. Nevertheless, very few models have succeeded in providing a real\nalternative solution to the Markowitz model. The main reason lies in the fact\nthat most academic portfolio optimization models are intractable in real life\nalthough they present solid theoretical properties. By intractable we mean that\nthey can be implemented for an investment universe with a small number of\nassets using a lot of computational resources and skills, but they are unable\nto manage a universe with dozens or hundreds of assets.

Again, the reason was the inability of\noptimization algorithms to solve high-dimensional industrial problems.\nNevertheless, the end of the 1990s marked an important turning point with the\ndevelopment and the rediscovery of several methods that have since produced\nimpressive results. The goal of this paper is to show how portfolio allocation\ncan benefit from the development of these large-scale optimization algorithms.\nNot all of these algorithms are useful in our case, but four of them are\nessential when solving complex portfolio optimization problems.

Such capabilities are\ncrucial for computer vision guided systems which interact with the environment:\nautonomous driving, augmented reality and robotics. In particular, we propose a\ntwo step procedure. During the first step we train a convolutional neural\nnetwork to jointly predict per-pixel globally unique instance labels and\ncorresponding local coordinates for each instance of a static object (e.g. a\nbuilding). During the second step we obtain scene coordinates by combining\nobject center coordinates and local coordinates and use them to perform 6-DoF\ncamera pose estimation. We evaluate our approach on real world (CamVid-360) and\nartificial (SceneCity) autonomous driving datasets.

More importantly, notwithstanding the amount of\nfunding already committed, we find evidences that suggest the 'Golden Eras' of\ngraphene science and technology were in 2010 and 2012 respectively, in spite of\nthe continued growth of journal and patent publications in this area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 10:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

At each\ntime instant, we must decide whether the suffix of length $n$ of the current\nstream (\"the active window\") belongs to a given regular language.\n  Recent works showed that the space complexity of an optimal deterministic\nsliding window algorithm for this problem is either constant, logarithmic or\nlinear in the window size $n$ and provided natural language theoretic\ncharacterizations of the space complexity classes. Subsequently, those results\nwere extended to randomized algorithms to show that any such algorithm admits\neither constant, double logarithmic, logarithmic or linear space complexity.\n  In this work, we make an important step forward and combine the sliding\nwindow model with the property testing setting, which results in\nultra-efficient algorithms for all regular languages.

Such signals provide\ninsights into some of the extreme conditions that take place in the vicinity of\nsupermassive black holes that lead to the launch of the relativistic jets. In\naddition, studies of characteristic timescales in blazar light curves shed\nlight on some of the challenging issues in blazar physics that includes\ndisk-jet connection, strong gravity near fast rotating supermassive black holes\nand release of gravitational waves from binary supermassive black hole systems.\nHowever, a number of issues associated with the search quasi-periodic\noscillations (QPOs) in blazar e.g., red-noise dominance, modest significance of\nthe detection, periodic modulation lasting for only a couple of cycles and\ntheir transient nature, make it difficult to estimate the true significance of\nthe detection.

In\nthis article, we propose to divide the pose estimation process into three\nstages: object detection, features detection and pose optimization.

More specifically, this paper is concerned with the Proportional\nIntegral (PI) regulation control of the left Neumann trace of a one-dimensional\nreaction-diffusion equation with a delayed right Dirichlet boundary control. In\nthis setting, the studied reaction-diffusion equation might be either open-loop\nstable or unstable. The proposed control strategy goes as follows. First, a\nfinite-dimensional truncated model that captures the unstable dynamics of the\noriginal infinite-dimensional system is obtained via spectral decomposition.\nThe truncated model is then augmented by an integral component on the tracking\nerror of the left Neumann trace. After resorting to the Artstein transformation\nto handle the control input delay, the PI controller is designed by pole\nshifting. Stability of the resulting closed-loop infinite-dimensional system,\nconsisting of the original reaction-diffusion equation with the PI controller,\nis then established thanks to an adequate Lyapunov function. In the case of a\ntime-varying reference input and a time-varying distributed disturbance, our\nstability result takes the form of an exponential Input-to-State Stability\n(ISS) estimate with fading memory. Finally, another exponential ISS estimate\nwith fading memory is established for the tracking performance of the reference\nsignal by the system output. In particular, these results assess the setpoint\nregulation of the left Neumann trace in the presence of distributed\nperturbations that converge to a steady-state value and with a time-derivative\nthat converges to zero.

To this end, models designed to\nreap the benefits of EVs' flexibility in the literature almost exclusively\nconsider charging stations as active players exploiting the EVs' flexibility.\nSuch stations are seen as static loads able to provide flexibility only when\nEVs are connected to them. However, this standpoint suffers from two major\nissues. First, the charging stations need to anticipate some important\nparameters of the incoming EVs, e.g. time of arrival and departure,\nstate-of-energy of the EV's battery at arrival and the required state-of-energy\nat its departure. Second, it observes the EVs only when they are connected to\nthese charging stations, thus overlooking the arbitrage and charging\nopportunities when the EVs are connected to other charging stations. This paper\nproposes a new viewpoint, where EVs are observed as dynamic movable storage\nsystems which can provide flexibility at any charging station. The paper\ndefines both systems, the existing one, where the flexibility is viewed from\nthe standpoint of charging stations, and the proposed one, where the\nflexibility is viewed from the EVs' standpoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 11:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

The\nfundamental ideas related to graph signals are introduced through a simple and\nintuitive, yet illustrative and general enough case study of multisensor\ntemperature field estimation. The concept of systems on graph is defined using\ngraph signal shift operators, which generalize the corresponding principles\nfrom traditional learning systems. At the core of the spectral domain\nrepresentation of graph signals and systems is the Graph Discrete Fourier\nTransform (GDFT). The spectral domain representations are then used as the\nbasis to introduce graph signal filtering concepts and address their design,\nincluding Chebyshev polynomial approximation series. Ideas related to the\nsampling of graph signals are presented and further linked with compressive\nsensing. Localized graph signal analysis in the joint vertex-spectral domain is\nreferred to as the vertex-frequency analysis, since it can be considered as an\nextension of classical time-frequency analysis to the graph domain of a signal.\nImportant topics related to the local graph Fourier transform (LGFT) are\ncovered, together with its various forms including the graph spectral and\nvertex domain windows and the inversion conditions and relations.

Here we try to\nclarify some subtleties in studying topological behaviors of interacting Weyl\nsemimetals. It is well-known that there exist two topological invariants\ndefined to identify their topological character. One is the many-body Chern\nnumber, which can be directly linked to the Hall conductivity and thus to the\ntwo-particle correlations. The other is the topological index constructed from\nthe single-particle Green's functions. Because the information of Green's\nfunctions is easier to be achieved than the many-body wavefunctions, usually\nonly the latter is employed in the literature. However, the approach based on\nthe single-particle Green's function can break down in the strongly correlated\nphase. For illustration, an exactly solvable two-orbital model with\nmomentum-local two-body interactions is discussed, in which both topological\ninvariants can be calculated analytically. We find that the topological index\ncalculated from the Green's function formalism can be nonzero even for a\nnon-topological strongly correlated phase with vanishing many-body Chern\nnumber. In addition, we stress that the physical surface states implied by\nnonzero many-body Chern numbers should be the edge modes of particle-hole\ncollective excitations, rather than those of quasiparticle nature derived from\nthe Green's function formalism. Our observations thus demonstrate the\nlimitation of the validity of Green's function formalism in the investigations\nof interacting topological materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 12:44:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 02:38:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-30"}

Many of these approaches\nare based on either mathematical, physical or biological models. A challenge\nfor these approaches is the modelling of the underlying processes (e.g. the\nphysics of image acquisition or the patho-physiology of a disease) with\nappropriate levels of detail and realism. With the availability of large\namounts of imaging data and machine learning (in particular deep learning)\ntechniques, data-driven approaches have become more widespread for use in\ndifferent tasks in reconstruction, analysis and interpretation. These\napproaches learn statistical models directly from labelled or unlabeled image\ndata and have been shown to be very powerful for extracting clinically useful\ninformation from medical imaging. While these data-driven approaches often\noutperform traditional model-based approaches, their clinical deployment often\nposes challenges in terms of robustness, generalization ability and\ninterpretability. In this article, we discuss what developments have motivated\nthe shift from model-based approaches towards data-driven strategies and what\npotential problems are associated with the move towards purely data-driven\napproaches, in particular deep learning.

In the framework of the GHOsT (GIARPS\nHigh-resolution Observations of T Tauri stars) project, we aim to perform a\nmulti-line analysis of the velocity components of the gas in the jet\nacceleration zone. We analyzed the GIARPS-TNG spectra of six objects in the\nTaurus-Auriga complex (RY Tau, DG Tau, DL Tau, HN Tau, DO Tau, RW Aur A).\nThanks to the combined high-spectral resolution (R=50000-115000) and wide\nspectral coverage (~400-2400 nm) we observed several O, S+, N, N+, and Fe+\nforbidden lines spanning a large range of excitation and ionization conditions.\nIn four objects (DG Tau, HN Tau, DO Tau, RW Aur A), temperature (T_e), electron\nand total density (n_e, n_H), and fractional ionization (x_e) were derived as a\nfunction of velocity through an excitation and ionization model. The abundance\nof gaseous iron, X(Fe), a probe of the dust content in the jet, was derived in\nselected velocity channels. The physical parameters vary smoothly with\nvelocity, suggesting a common origin for the different kinematic components. In\nDG Tau and HN Tau, T_e, x_e, and X(Fe) increase with velocity (roughly from\n6000 K, 0.05, 10% X(Fe)_sun to 15000 K, 0.6, 90% X(Fe)_sun). This trend is in\nagreement with disk-wind models in which the jet is launched from regions of\nthe disk at different radii. In DO Tau and RW Aur A, we infer x_e < 0.1, n_H\n~10^6-7 cm^-3, and X(Fe) <~ X(Fe)_sun at all velocities. These findings are\ntentatively explained by the formation of these jets from dense regions inside\nthe inner, gaseous disk, or as a consequence of their high degree of\ncollimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 14:36:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

We propose a novel network\nutilizing a graph representation to learn the policy. We first train a graph\nconvolutional network based on human gaze data that accurately predicts human\nattention to different agents in the crowd. Then we incorporate the learned\nattention into a graph-based reinforcement learning architecture. The proposed\nattention mechanism enables the assignment of meaningful weightings to the\nneighbors of the robot, and has the additional benefit of interpretability.\nExperiments on real-world dense pedestrian datasets with various crowd sizes\ndemonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-art methods by 18.4% in task\naccomplishment and by 16.4% in time efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 14:46:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

We include, for the first time, a comprehensive\ndust-gas chemistry in our AGB outflow chemical kinetics model, including both\ndust-gas interactions and grain-surface chemistry. The dust is assumed to have\nformed in the inner region, and follows an interstellar-like dust-size\ndistribution. Using radiative transfer modelling, we obtain dust temperature\nprofiles for different dust types in an O-rich and a C-rich outflow. We\ncalculate a grid of models, sampling different outflow densities, drift\nvelocities between the dust and gas, and dust types. Dust-gas chemistry can\nsignificantly affect the gas-phase composition, depleting parent and daughter\nspecies and increasing the abundance of certain daughter species via\ngrain-surface formation followed by desorption/sputtering. Its influence\ndepends on four factors: outflow density, dust temperature, initial\ncomposition, and drift velocity. The largest effects are for higher density\noutflows with cold dust and O-rich parent species, as these species generally\nhave a larger binding energy. At drift velocities larger than $\\sim 10$ km\ns$^{-1}$, ice mantles undergo sputtering; however, they are not fully\ndestroyed. Models with dust-gas chemistry can better reproduce the observed\ndepletion of species in O-rich outflows.

In the real observations, the\ncritical height of the background field is unknown, so a typical value of\n$n_{c}=1.5$ is adopted from the numerical studies.

The Teleparallel gravity (TEGR) is an\nalternative formulation of gravity which uses tetrads as the dynamical\nvariables. We focus on two particularly interesting scenarios. First, we\ndevelop the Einstein clusters in TEGR field equations using effective\nenergy-momentum tensor for diagonal as well as off-diagonal tetrad. We then\nstudy the clusters in modified $f(T)-$gravity for anisotropic fluid\ndistribution. Based on these two theories, we further study the solution\nwithout net electric charge and then for charged solution. For charge parameter\n$k \\rightarrow 0$, the charged solution reduces to neutral one. Our\ncalculations show that when charge increases, the stiffness of the EoS also\nincreases. This is due to increase in adiabatic index and sound speed\napproaching speed of light. When the charge increase beyond a certain limit\n($0\\le k \\le 1.3 \\times 10^{-5}$ and $0\\le k \\le 1 \\times 10^{-6}$), the\ncompactness parameter crosses the Buchdahl limit i.e. $2M/R>8/9$ and the\nsolution start violating the causality condition.

We analyze the\nstatic stability criterion of the Einstein clusters for both charged and\nuncharged case, and the stability of such compact objects is enhanced by the\npresence some net electric charge.

As a result, we concluded that the Einstein cluster\nsolution do exist in pure GR, however, physically unfit to mimic compact stars.\nWe have also extend our findings by assuming the diagonal or off-diagonal\ntetrad and specific case of $f(T)$. In such models, Einstein's cluster\nsolutions do exist however can't mimic the properties of a compact star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 12:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

In this case, the subject specific\nlocalization is coarse and is unable to capture subtle abnormalities. To\nmitigate this, our method builds a novel CNN based discriminative localization\nmodel that we call high resolution CAM (HR-CAM), which accounts for layers from\neach resolution, therefore facilitating a comprehensive map that can delineate\nthe pathology for each subject by combining low-level, intermediate as well as\nhigh-level features from the CNN.

Hence,the hypothesis that if government desires to levy personal\nincome tax or value added tax, it makes a detailed research in terms of\nproductivity of taxes forms the fundamental of this study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 14:01:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

However,\nminimizing the total energy consumption does not imply the network lifetime is\nmaximized. In this paper, we study the problem of scheduling data aggregation\ntrees working for different time periods to maximize the network lifetime when\na fixed number of data are allowed to be aggregated into one packet. In\naddition, we propose a heuristic to balance the lifetime of nodes in data\naggregation trees such that the network lifetime is maximized. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed heuristic provides a good performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 03:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-14"}
