We find that, while individual neurons do\nnot learn interpretable features in wide networks, groups of neurons do. In\naddition, the hidden state of a wide network contains more information about\nthe inputs than that of a narrow network trained to the same test accuracy.\nInspired by this observation, we show that when fine-tuning the last layer of a\nnetwork on a new task, performance improves significantly as the width of the\nnetwork is increased, even though test accuracy on the original task is\nindependent of width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 16:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-26"}

However, variability in images is\nnot just due to different depicted object classes, but also depends on other\nlatent characteristics such as viewpoint or illumination. In addition to these\nstructured properties, random noise further obstructs the visual relations of\ninterest. The common approach to metric learning is to enforce a representation\nthat is invariant under all factors but the ones of interest. In contrast, we\npropose to explicitly learn the latent characteristics that are shared by and\ngo across object classes. We can then directly explain away structured visual\nvariability, rather than assuming it to be unknown random noise. We propose a\nnovel surrogate task to learn visual characteristics shared across classes with\na separate encoder. This encoder is trained jointly with the encoder for class\ninformation by reducing their mutual information.

In the classical and semiclassical approaches,\nHamiltonian EPs (HEPs) are usually defined as degeneracies of non-Hermitian\nHamiltonians such that at least two eigenfrequencies are identical and the\ncorresponding eigenstates coalesce. HEPs result from continuous, mostly slow,\nnonunitary evolution without quantum jumps. Clearly, quantum jumps should be\nincluded in a fully quantum approach to make it equivalent to, e.g., the\nLindblad master-equation approach. Thus, we suggest to define EPs via\ndegeneracies of a Liouvillian superoperator (including the full Lindbladian\nterm, LEPs), and we clarify the relations between HEPs and LEPs. We prove two\nmain theorems: Theorem 1 proves that, in the quantum limit, LEPs and HEPs must\nhave essentially different properties. Theorem 2 dictates a condition under\nwhich, in the ``semiclassical'' limit, LEPs and HEPs recover the same\nproperties. In particular, we show the validity of Theorem 1 studying systems\nwhich have (1) an LEP but no HEPs, and (2) both LEPs and HEPs but for shifted\nparameters. As for Theorem 2, (3) we show that these two types of EPs become\nessentially equivalent in the semiclassical limit.

Here, we note that\ninputs to the algorithm were not clearly specified in the original\npresentation; as such, we deem complexity claims as not grounded, and\nconjecture solving $\\alpha$-Rank is NP-hard. The authors of $\\alpha$-Rank\nsuggested that the input to $\\alpha$-Rank can be an exponentially-sized payoff\nmatrix; a claim promised to be clarified in subsequent manuscripts. Even though\n$\\alpha$-Rank exhibits a polynomial-time solution with respect to such an\ninput, we further reflect additional critical problems. We demonstrate that due\nto the need of constructing an exponentially large Markov chain, $\\alpha$-Rank\nis infeasible beyond a small finite number of agents. We ground these claims by\nadopting amount of dollars spent as a non-refutable evaluation metric.\nRealising such scalability issue, we present a stochastic implementation of\n$\\alpha$-Rank with a double oracle mechanism allowing for reductions in joint\nstrategy spaces. Our method, $\\alpha^\\alpha$-Rank, does not need to save\nexponentially-large transition matrix, and can terminate early under required\nprecision.

Conducting molecular dynamics simulations on Mg, we\nshow that the propagation of twinning disconnections emitted by basal-prismatic\ninterfaces controls the twin boundary motion and is the rate-limiting mechanism\nduring the initial growth of the twin embryo. The time needed for disconnection\npropagation is related to the distance between the twin tips, with widely\nspaced twin tips requiring more time for a unit twin boundary migration event\nto be completed. Thus, a phenomenological model, which unifies the two\nprocesses of disconnection and twin tip propagation, is proposed here to\nprovide a quantitative analysis of twin embryo growth. The model fits the\nsimulation data well, with two key parameters (twin tip velocity and twinning\ndisconnection velocity) being extracted. In addition, a linear relationship\nbetween the ratio of twinning disconnection velocity to twin tip velocity and\nthe applied shear stress is observed. Using an example of twin growth in a\nnanoscale single crystal from the recent literature, we find that our molecular\ndynamics simulations and analytical model are in good agreement with\nexperimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:53:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 01:22:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

This can,\nhowever, be a bit prohibitive when it comes to more accurate levels of quantum\ntheory. As such it is desirable to train a model using the absolute minimal\ndata set possible, especially when costs of high-fidelity calculations such as\nCCSD and QMC are high. Here, we present an Active Learning approach that\niteratively trains an ANN model to faithfully replicate the coarse-grained\nenergy surface of water clusters using only 426 total structures in its\ntraining data. Our active learning workflow starts with a sparse training\ndataset which is continually updated via a Monte Carlo scheme that sparsely\nqueries the energy landscape and tests the network performance. Next, the\nnetwork is retrained with an updated training set that includes failed\nconfigurations/energies from previous iteration until convergence is attained.\nOnce trained, we generate an extensive test set of ~100,000 configurations\nsampled across clusters ranging from 1 to 200 molecules and demonstrate that\nthe trained network adequately reproduces the energies (within mean absolute\nerror (MAE) of ~ 2 meV/molecule) and forces (MAE ~ 40 meV/{\\r{A}}) compared to\nthe reference model. More importantly, the trained ANN model also accurately\ncaptures both the structure as well as the free energy as a function of the\nvarious cluster sizes.

The main idea is to consider joint\ntrajectories of particles' positions and self-propulsions. It is then possible\nto exploit formal similarity of an active system and a system consisting of two\nsubsystems interacting with different heat reservoirs and coupled by a\nnon-symmetric interaction. The resulting thermodynamic description closely\nfollows the standard stochastic thermodynamics. In particular, total entropy\nproduction, $\\Delta s_\\text{tot}$, can be decomposed into housekeeping, $\\Delta\ns_\\text{hk}$, and excess, $\\Delta s_\\text{ex}$, parts. Both $\\Delta\ns_\\text{tot}$ and $\\Delta s_\\text{hk}$ satisfy fluctuation theorems. The\naverage rate of the steady-state housekeeping entropy production can be related\nto the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem via a Harada-Sasa\nrelation. The excess entropy production enters into a Hatano-Sasa-like\nrelation, which leads to a generalized Clausius inequality involving the change\nof the system's entropy and the excess entropy production. Interestingly,\nalthough the evolution of particles' self-propulsions is free and uncoupled\nfrom that of their positions, non-trivial steady-state correlations between\nthese variables lead to the non-zero excess dissipation in the reservoir\ncoupled to the self-propulsions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:02:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 17:11:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

However, for the use as Dark Matter (DM) detectors,\nsuch crystals demand a high level of radio-purity, not achievable by means of\nstandard industrial techniques. One of the main difficulties comes from the\npresence of potassium that always accompanies sodium in alkali halides. On the\nother hand, the arguable DM detection by DAMA experiment using NaI(Tl)\nscintillating crystals requires a reliable verification able to either confirm\nthe existence of DM or rule out the DAMA claim. Ultra-low radioactivity NaI(Tl)\ncrystals, particularly with very low potassium content, are therefore\nindispensable to overcome the current stalemate in Dark Matter searches.\nNonetheless, apart from DAMA-LIBRA experiments, to date, no other experiment\nhas succeeded in building a detector from NaI(Tl) crystals with potassium\ncontent of ppb level. This work describes recent results in the preparation of\nultra-radio-pure NaI(Tl) crystals using a modified Bridgman method. A\ndouble-walled platinum crucible technique has been designed and reliability\ntests show that 5 ppb of potassium in the NaI(Tl) crystals of 2 and 3 inches in\ndiameter can be achieved starting from NaI powder with potassium content of the\norder of 10 ppb. The potassium excess is segregated in the tail-side of the as\ngrown ingot where measured potassium concentration is above 20 ppb. The\npurifying effect of Bridgman growth for larger NaI(Tl) crystals is currently\nbeing tested. The work also reports on scintillation parameters of our NaI(Tl)\ncrystals measured in a dedicated setup conceived for naked, hygroscopic\ncrystals. The reproducible and reliable production of ultra-low radioactivity\nNaI(Tl) crystals reported in this work will hopefully spur the construction of\nnew DM search experiments and, anyway, clarify the controversial DAMA-LIBRA\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-27"}

We distinguish two main cases depending on\nthe level of genericity queries are enforced to satisfy. Under strong\ngenericity assumptions the language cannot express matrix convolution, a very\nimportant operation in current machine learning operations. This language is\nalso local, and thus cannot express operations such as matrix inverse that\nexhibit a recursive behavior. For expressing convolution, one can relax the\ngenericity requirement by adding an underlying linear order on the domain.\nThis, however, destroys locality and turns the expressive power of the language\nmuch more difficult to understand.

Extending a state-of-the-art\ndeterministic method, Prototypical Networks (Snell et al., 2017), our approach\nsupposes the existence of a class prototype around which class instances are\nGaussian distributed. The prototype posterior is a product distribution over\nlabeled instances, and query instances are classified by marginalizing relative\nprototype proximity over embedding uncertainty. We describe an efficient\nsampler for approximate inference that allows us to train the model at roughly\nthe same space and time cost as its deterministic sibling.

The concept of duck curve is widely used to describe the timing\nimbalance between peak demand and PV generation. The traditional duck curve is\ndeterministic and only shows a single extreme or typical scenario during a day.\nThus, it cannot capture both the probability of that scenario and the\nuncertainty of PV generation and loads. These weaknesses limit the application\nof the duck curve on power system planning under high PV penetration. To\naddress this issue, the novel concepts of probabilistic duck curve (PDC) and\nprobabilistic ramp curve (PRC) are proposed to accurately model the uncertainty\nand variability of electricity net load and ramp under high PV penetration. An\nefficient method is presented for modeling PDC and PRC using kernel density\nestimation, copula function, and dependent discrete convolution. Several\nindices are designed to quantify the characteristics of the PDC and PRC. For\nthe application, we demonstrate how the PDC and PRC will benefit flexible\nresource planning. Finally, an empirical study on the Qinghai provincial power\nsystem of China validates the effectiveness of the presented method. The\nresults of PDC and PRC intuitively illustrate that the ramp demand and the\nvalley of net load face considerable uncertainty under high PV penetration. The\nresults of flexible resource planning indicate that retrofitting coal-fired\nunits has remarkable performance on enhancing the power system flexibility in\nQinghai. In average, reducing the minimal output of coal-fired units by 1 MW\nwill increase PV accommodation by over 4 MWh each day.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 18:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-27"}

Using our methodology, we propose scalar (QUASAR)\nand vector (qV) quantum ISAs as extensions and compare them with other ISAs in\nmetrics such as circuit encoding efficiency, the ability to meet real-time gate\ncycle requirements of quantum chips, and the ability to scale to more qubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 19:21:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 00:15:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

Its success is generally\nattributed to the privileged information on similarities among categories\nprovided by the teacher model, and in this sense, only strong teacher models\nare deployed to teach weaker students in practice. In this work, we challenge\nthis common belief by following experimental observations: 1) beyond the\nacknowledgment that the teacher can improve the student, the student can also\nenhance the teacher significantly by reversing the KD procedure; 2) a\npoorly-trained teacher with much lower accuracy than the student can still\nimprove the latter significantly. To explain these observations, we provide a\ntheoretical analysis of the relationships between KD and label smoothing\nregularization. We prove that 1) KD is a type of learned label smoothing\nregularization and 2) label smoothing regularization provides a virtual teacher\nmodel for KD. From these results, we argue that the success of KD is not fully\ndue to the similarity information between categories from teachers, but also to\nthe regularization of soft targets, which is equally or even more important.\n  Based on these analyses, we further propose a novel Teacher-free Knowledge\nDistillation (Tf-KD) framework, where a student model learns from itself or\nmanuallydesigned regularization distribution. The Tf-KD achieves comparable\nperformance with normal KD from a superior teacher, which is well applied when\na stronger teacher model is unavailable. Meanwhile, Tf-KD is generic and can be\ndirectly deployed for training deep neural networks. Without any extra\ncomputation cost, Tf-KD achieves up to 0.65\\% improvement on ImageNet over\nwell-established baseline models, which is superior to label smoothing\nregularization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 19:33:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 03:53:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 08:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-05"}

The data show evidence for systematics that, without\nremoval, would hinder a detection of the 21 cm power spectrum for the targeted\nEoR line-of-sight modes in the range 0.2 < k_parallel < 0.5\\ h^-1 Mpc. After\nsystematic removal, we find we can recover these modes in the power spectrum\ndown to the integrated noise-floor of a nightly observation, achieving a\ndynamic range in the EoR window of 10^-6 in power (mK^2 units) with respect to\nthe bright galactic foreground signal. In the absence of other systematics and\nassuming the systematic suppression demonstrated here continues to lower noise\nlevels, our results suggest that fully-integrated HERA Phase I may have the\ncapacity to set competitive upper limits on the 21 cm power spectrum.

Solar spectral irradiance (SSI) variability is one of the key inputs\nto models of the Earth's climate. Understanding solar irradiance fluctuations\nalso helps to place the Sun among other stars in terms of their brightness\nvariability patterns and to set detectability limits for terrestrial\nexo-planets.\n  Aims. One of the most successful and widely used models of solar irradiance\nvariability is SATIRE-S. It uses spectra of the magnetic features and\nsurrounding quiet Sun computed with the ATLAS9 spectral synthesis code under\nthe assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). SATIRE-S has been at\nthe forefront of solar variability modelling, but due to the limitations of the\nLTE approximation its output SSI has to be empirically corrected below 300 nm,\nwhich reduces the physical consistency of its results. This shortcoming is\naddressed in the present paper.\n  Methods. We replace the ATLAS9 spectra of all atmospheric components in\nSATIRE-S with the spectra calculated using the non-LTE Spectral Synthesis Code\n(NESSY). We also use Fontenla et al. (1999) temperature and density\nstratification models of the solar atmosphere to compute the spectrum of the\nquiet Sun and faculae.\n  Results. We compute non-LTE contrasts of spots and faculae and combine them\nwith the SDO/HMI filling factors of the active regions to calculate the total\nand spectral solar irradiance variability during solar cycle 24.\n  Conclusions. The non-LTE contrasts result in total and spectral solar\nirradiance in good agreement with the empirically corrected output of the LTE\nversion. This suggests that empirical correction introduced into SATIRE-S\noutput is well judged and that the corrected total and spectral solar\nirradiance obtained from the SATIRE-S model in LTE is fully consistent with the\nresults of non-LTE computations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 19:57:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

However, at the same time, it\nalso raises many problems about dock-less shared bike management due to the\nmismatching between demands and real distribution of bikes. Before deploying\ndock-less shared bikes in a city, companies need to make a plan for dispatching\nbikes from places having excessive bikes to locations with high demands for\nproviding better services. In this paper, we study the problem of inferring\nfine-grained bike demands anywhere in a new city before the deployment of\nbikes. This problem is challenging because new city lacks training data and\nbike demands vary by both places and time. To solve the problem, we provide\nvarious methods to extract discriminative features from multi-source geographic\ndata, such as POI, road networks and nighttime light, for each place. We\nutilize correlation Principle Component Analysis (coPCA) to deal with extracted\nfeatures of both old city and new city to realize distribution adaption. Then,\nwe adopt a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based model to mine daily patterns\nfor each place from fine-grained bike demand. We propose an attention based\nlocal CNN model, \\textbf{ALCNN}, to infer the daily patterns with latent\nfeatures from coPCA with multiple CNNs for modeling the influence of neighbor\nplaces. In addition, ALCNN merges latent features from multiple CNNs and can\nselect a suitable size of influenced regions. The extensive experiments on\nreal-life datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms competitive\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 21:05:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-27"}

Here we propose methods to use high-density\ndiamond NV centers coupled by spin-spin interaction with an average separation\non the order of 10 nm for quantum computing.

Error-optimal primitives (for,\ne.g., estimating means and item frequencies) under LDP have been well studied.\nFor analytical tasks such as range queries, however, the best known error bound\nis dependent on the domain size of private data, which is potentially\nprohibitive. This deficiency is inherent as LDP protects the same level of\nindistinguishability between any pair of private data values for each data\ndowner.\n  In this paper, we utilize an extension of $\\epsilon$-LDP called Metric-LDP or\n$E$-LDP, where a metric $E$ defines heterogeneous privacy guarantees for\ndifferent pairs of private data values and thus provides a more flexible knob\nthan $\\epsilon$ does to relax LDP and tune utility-privacy trade-offs.

These experiments have observed diverse dynamical\nstates, including flocks, polar streams, and single-filament spirals.

To\navoid this drawback of DP, we consider datasets containing almost periodic time\nseries, composed of periodic components and noisy variations on top that are\nindependent across periods. Our interest in these datasets is motivated by\nthat, for reporting on private periodic time series, we do not need to divide\nthe privacy budget across the entire, possibly infinite, horizon. Instead, for\nperiodic time series, we generate DP reports for the first period and report\nthe same DP reports periodically. In practice, however, exactly periodic time\nseries do not exist as the data always contains small variations due to random\nor uncertain events. For instance, the energy consumption of a household may\nrepeat the same daily pattern with slight variations due to minor changes to\nthe habits of the individuals. The underlying periodic pattern is a function of\nthe private information of the households. It might be desired to protect the\nprivacy of households by not leaking information about the recurring patterns\nwhile the individual daily variations are almost noise-like with little to no\nprivacy concerns (depending on the situation). Motivated by this, we define DP\nfor almost periodic datasets and develop a Laplace mechanism for responding to\nlinear queries. We provide statistical tools for testing the validity of almost\nperiodicity assumption. We use multiple energy datasets containing smart-meter\nmeasurements of households to validate almost periodicity assumption.

Current approaches rely on simultaneously learning embedded features and\nclustering the data points in the latent space. Although numerous deep\nclustering approaches outperform the shallow models in achieving favorable\nresults on several high-semantic datasets, a critical weakness of such models\nhas been overlooked. In the absence of concrete supervisory signals, the\nembedded clustering objective function may distort the latent space by learning\nfrom unreliable pseudo-labels. Thus, the network can learn non-representative\nfeatures, which in turn undermines the discriminative ability, yielding worse\npseudo-labels. In order to alleviate the effect of random discriminative\nfeatures, modern autoencoder-based clustering papers propose to use the\nreconstruction loss for pretraining and as a regularizer during the clustering\nphase. Nevertheless, a clustering-reconstruction trade-off can cause the\n\\textit{Feature Drift} phenomena.

The\nmain objective of this paper is to present a practical method of realizing more\nrobust walking on hardware through active ankle compensation. The nominal gait\nwas generated through the hybrid zero dynamic framework. The ankles are\nindividually controlled to establish three main directives; (1) keeping the\nnon-stance foot parallel to the ground, (2) maintaining rigid contact between\nthe stance foot and the ground, and (3) closing the loop on pelvis orientation\nto achieve better tracking. Each individual component of this method was\ndemonstrated separately to show each component's contribution to stability. The\nresults showed that the ankle controller was able to experimentally maintain\nstatic balance in the sagittal plane while the exoskeleton was balanced on one\nleg, even when disturbed. The entire ankle controller was then also\ndemonstrated on crutch-less dynamic walking. During testing, an anatomically\ncorrect manikin was placed in the exoskeleton, in lieu of a paraplegic patient.\nThe pitch of the pelvis of the exoskeleton-manikin system was shown to track\nthe gait trajectory better when ankle compensation was used. Overall, active\nankle compensation was demonstrated experimentally to improve balance in the\nsagittal plane of the exoskeleton manikin system and points to an improved\npractical approach for stable walking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 02:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-27"}

To address these issues, we propose a\nlightweight information multi-distillation network (IMDN) by constructing the\ncascaded information multi-distillation blocks (IMDB), which contains\ndistillation and selective fusion parts. Specifically, the distillation module\nextracts hierarchical features step-by-step, and fusion module aggregates them\naccording to the importance of candidate features, which is evaluated by the\nproposed contrast-aware channel attention mechanism. To process real images\nwith any sizes, we develop an adaptive cropping strategy (ACS) to super-resolve\nblock-wise image patches using the same well-trained model. Extensive\nexperiments suggest that the proposed method performs favorably against the\nstate-of-the-art SR algorithms in term of visual quality, memory footprint, and\ninference time.

Bayesian inference is\nthe standard framework for astro-physical measurement in transient\ngravitational-wave astronomy. Usually, stochastic sampling algorithms are used\nto estimate posterior probability distributions over the parameter spaces of\nmodels describing experimental data. The most physically accurate models\ntypically come with a large computational overhead which can render data\nanalysis extremely time consuming, or possibly even prohibitive. In some cases\nhighly specialized optimizations can mitigate these issues, though they can be\ndifficult to implement, as well as to generalize to arbitrary models of the\ndata. Here, we propose an accurate, flexible and scalable method for\nastro-physical inference: parallelized nested sampling. The reduction in the\nwall-time of inference scales almost linearly with the number of parallel\nprocesses running on a high-performance computing cluster. By utilizing a pool\nof several hundreds or thousands of CPUs in a high-performance cluster, the\nlarge wall times of many astrophysical inferences can be alleviated while\nsimultaneously ensuring that any gravitational-wave signal model can be used\n\"out of the box\", i.e., without additional optimization or approximation.

Multiple pursuers defend the goal region by\nconsecutively capturing multiple evaders in the play region. The players have\nheterogeneous moving speeds and the pursuers have heterogeneous capture radii.\nSince this game is hard to analyze directly, we decompose the whole game as\nmany subgames which involve multiple pursuers and only one evader. Then, these\nsubgames are used as a building block for the pursuer-evader matching. First,\nfor multiple pursuers and one evader, we introduce an evasion space (ES) method\ncharacterized by a potential function to construct a guaranteed pursuer winning\nstrategy. Then, based on this strategy, we develop conditions to determine\nwhether a pursuit team can guard the goal region against one evader. It is\nshown that in 3D, if a pursuit team is able to defend the goal region against\nan evader, then at most three pursuers in the team are necessarily needed.

In this paper, we will offer a\nsignificantly extended and refined reconstruction of the theorem in multi-agent\nmodal logic. We will then show that a thorough reconstruction of the proof as\ngiven by Frauchiger and Renner requires the reflexivity of access relations\n(system $\\mathsf{\\mathbf{T}}$). However, a stronger theorem is possible that\nalready follows in serial frames, and hence also holds in systems of\n\\emph{doxastic} logic (such as $\\mathsf{\\mathbf{KD45}}$). After proving this,\nwe will discuss the general implications for different interpretations of\nquantum probabilities as well as several options for dealing with the result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 04:49:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-27"}

To deal with dynamic effects of\ntrailing units, a force sensor is innovatively installed at the connection\nbetween the tractor and the first trailer to measure the forces acting on the\ntractor.

The proposed methods are evaluated on two\nmultichannel SE tasks, namely the dual-channel inner-ear microphones SE task\nand the distributed microphones SE task. The experimental results confirm the\noutstanding denoising capability of the proposed SE systems on both tasks and\nthe benefits of using the residual architecture on the overall SE performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 05:51:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 15:31:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 08:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}

To suppress noise\neffects, speech enhancement (SE) is a necessary unit in EAS devices. Recently,\na time-domain speech enhancement algorithm based on the fully convolutional\nneural networks (FCN) with a short-time objective intelligibility (STOI)-based\nobjective function (termed FCN(S) in short) has received increasing attention\ndue to its simple structure and effectiveness of restoring clean speech signals\nfrom noisy counterparts.

Objective evaluations and listening\ntests were conducted to examine the performance of FCN(S) in improving the\nspeech intelligibility of normal and vocoded speech in noisy environments.

Our DFL method is an improvement on the\nrecently reported Focal Loss (FL) cross-entropy function, which proposes a\nscaling method that puts more weight on the examples that are difficult to\nclassify over those that are easy. However, the scaling parameter of FL is\nempirically set, which is problem-dependent. In addition, like other CE\nvariants, FL only focuses on the loss of true classes. Therefore, no loss\nfeedback is gained from the false classes. Although focusing only on true\nexamples increases probability on true classes and correspondingly reduces\nprobability on false classes due to the nature of the softmax function, it does\nnot achieve the best convergence due to avoidance of the loss on false classes.\nOur DFL method improves on the simple FL in two ways. Firstly, it takes the\nidea of FL to focus more on difficult examples than the easy ones, but\nevaluates loss on both true and negative classes with equal importance.\nSecondly, the scaling parameter of DFL has been made learnable so that it can\ntune itself by backpropagation rather than being dependent on manual tuning. In\nthis way, our proposed DFL method offers an auto-tunable loss function that can\nreduce the class imbalance effect as well as put more focus on both true\ndifficult examples and negative easy examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 06:36:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 2019 13:54:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 05:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

To address this deficiency, we develop a new\nHSI classification method based on the recently proposed Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN), as it can flexibly encode the relations among arbitrarily\nstructured non-Euclidean data. Different from traditional GCN, there are two\nnovel strategies adopted by our method to further exploit the contextual\nrelations for accurate HSI classification. First, since the receptive field of\ntraditional GCN is often limited to fairly small neighborhood, we proposed to\ncapture long range contextual relations in HSI by performing successive graph\nconvolutions on a learned region-induced graph which is transformed from the\noriginal 2D image grids. Second, we refine the graph edge weight and the\nconnective relationships among image regions by learning the improved adjacency\nmatrix and the 'edge filter', so that the graph can be gradually refined to\nadapt to the representations generated by each graph convolutional layer. Such\nupdated graph will in turn result in accurate region representations, and vice\nversa. The experiments carried out on three real-world benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed method yields significant improvement in the\nclassification performance when compared with some state-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 07:37:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-27"}

In particular we\nprove a decomposition formula and a related additive property. Then, we\nintroduce the set of conditional constituents generated by $n$ conditional\nevents and we show that they satisfy the basic properties valid in the case of\nunconditional events. We obtain a generalized inclusion-exclusion formula and\nwe prove a suitable distributivity property. Moreover, under logical\nindependence of basic unconditional events, we give two necessary and\nsufficient coherence conditions. The first condition gives a geometrical\ncharacterization for the coherence of prevision assessments on a family\n$\\mathscr{F}$ constituted by $n$ conditional events and all possible\nconjunctions among them. The second condition characterizes the coherence of\nprevision assessments defined on $\\mathscr{F}\\cup \\mathscr{K}$, where\n$\\mathscr{K}$ is the set of conditional constituents associated with the\nconditional events in $\\mathscr{F}$. Then, we give a further theoretical result\nand we examine some examples and counterexamples.

Existing methods assume a linear\nbehavior of these systems, leading to significant modeling errors within\nnonlinear regions exhibited at higher magnetic fields. In this paper, we use a\nrandom forest (RF) and an artificial neural network (ANN) to model the\nnonlinear behavior of the magnetic fields generated by an eMNS. Both machine\nlearning methods outperformed the state-of-the-art linear multipole\nelectromagnet method (LMEM).

Deep features appear general in that they are\napplicable to many datasets and tasks. Such property is in prevalent use in\nreal-world applications. A neural network pretrained on large datasets, such as\nImageNet, can significantly boost generalization and accelerate training if\nfine-tuned to a smaller target dataset. Despite its pervasiveness, few effort\nhas been devoted to uncovering the reason of transferability in deep feature\nrepresentations. This paper tries to understand transferability from the\nperspectives of improved generalization, optimization and the feasibility of\ntransferability. We demonstrate that 1) Transferred models tend to find flatter\nminima, since their weight matrices stay close to the original flat region of\npretrained parameters when transferred to a similar target dataset; 2)\nTransferred representations make the loss landscape more favorable with\nimproved Lipschitzness, which accelerates and stabilizes training\nsubstantially. The improvement largely attributes to the fact that the\nprincipal component of gradient is suppressed in the pretrained parameters,\nthus stabilizing the magnitude of gradient in back-propagation. 3) The\nfeasibility of transferability is related to the similarity of both input and\nlabel. And a surprising discovery is that the feasibility is also impacted by\nthe training stages in that the transferability first increases during\ntraining, and then declines. We further provide a theoretical analysis to\nverify our observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 11:23:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-27"}

One of the key assumptions of such algorithms has\nbeen that the objects are fat, with a few exceptions in two dimensions; for\nexample, the packing problem of a set of polygons in the plane surprisingly\nadmits a subexponential algorithm. In this paper we give tight running time\nbounds for packing similarly-sized non-fat objects in higher dimensions.\n  We propose an alternative and very weak measure of fatness called the\nstabbing number, and show that the packing problem in Euclidean space of\nconstant dimension $d \\geq 3$ for a family of similarly sized objects with\nstabbing number $\\alpha$ can be solved in $2^{O(n^{1-1/d}\\alpha)}$ time.

Central in the\nsuccess of G-CNNs is the lifting of feature maps to higher dimensional\ndisentangled representations, in which data characteristics are effectively\nlearned, geometric data-augmentations are made obsolete, and predictable\nbehavior under geometric transformations (equivariance) is guaranteed via group\ntheory. Currently, however, the practical implementations of G-CNNs are limited\nto either discrete groups (that leave the grid intact) or continuous compact\ngroups such as rotations (that enable the use of Fourier theory). In this paper\nwe lift these limitations and propose a modular framework for the design and\nimplementation of G-CNNs for arbitrary Lie groups. In our approach the\ndifferential structure of Lie groups is used to expand convolution kernels in a\ngeneric basis of B-splines that is defined on the Lie algebra. This leads to a\nflexible framework that enables localized, atrous, and deformable convolutions\nin G-CNNs by means of respectively localized, sparse and non-uniform B-spline\nexpansions. The impact and potential of our approach is studied on two\nbenchmark datasets: cancer detection in histopathology slides in which rotation\nequivariance plays a key role and facial landmark localization in which scale\nequivariance is important. In both cases, G-CNN architectures outperform their\nclassical 2D counterparts and the added value of atrous and localized group\nconvolutions is studied in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 12:42:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 2019 08:33:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 12:53:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 08:46:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

Gradient boosting is an additive\nexpansion algorithm in which a series of models are trained sequentially to\napproximate a given function. A neural network can also be seen as an additive\nexpansion where the scalar product of the responses of the last hidden layer\nand its weights provide the final output of the network. Instead of training\nthe network as a whole, the proposed algorithm trains the network sequentially\nin $T$ steps. First, the bias term of the network is initialized with a\nconstant approximation that minimizes the average loss of the data. Then, at\neach step, a portion of the network, composed of $J$ neurons, is trained to\napproximate the pseudo-residuals on the training data computed from the\nprevious iterations. Finally, the $T$ partial models and bias are integrated as\na single NN with $T \\times J$ neurons in the hidden layer.

At present, there is no quantitative\nagreement between measurements and modeling of cross-field demagnetization,\nmainly due to the need of a 3D model that takes the end effects and real\nmicron-thick superconducting layer into account. This article presents 3D\nmodeling and measurements of cross-field demagnetization in stacks of up to 5\ntapes and initial magnetization modeling of stacks of up to 15 tapes. 3D\nmodeling of the cross-field demagnetization explicitly shows that the critical\ncurrent density, $J_c$, in the direction perpendicular to the tape surface does\nnot play a role in cross-field demagnetization. When taking the measured\nanisotropic magnetic field dependence of $J_c$ into account, 3D calculations\nagree with measurements with less than 4 % deviation, while the error of 2D\nmodeling is much higher. Then, our 3D numerical methods can realistically\npredict cross-field demagnetization.

Here we ask the question whether the Waldmeier Effect exists in other\nSun-like stars. To answer this question, we analyze the Ca \\II{} H \\& K S-index\nfrom Mount Wilson Observatory for 21 Sun-like G--K stars. We specifically check\ntwo aspects of Waldmeier Effect, namely, WE1: the anti-correlation between the\nrise times and the peaks and WE2: the positive correlation between rise rates\nand amplitudes. We show that except HD~16160, HD~81809, HD~155886 and\nHD~161239, all stars considered in the analysis show WE2. While WE1 is found to\nbe present only in some of the stars studied. Further, the WE1 correlation is\nweaker than the WE2. Both WE1 and WE2 exist in the solar S-index as well.\nSimilar to the solar cycles, the magnetic cycles of many stars are asymmetric\nabout their maxima. The existence of the Waldmeier Effect and asymmetric cycles\nin Sun-like stars suggests that the dynamo mechanism which operates in the Sun\nis also operating in other stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 14:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

A large part of the\nthesis is also devoted to the development of efficient methods for obtaining\naverage consensus on large scale networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 15:15:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-27"}

Unfortunately, one often\nhas to rely solely on inexact numerical simulation, due to the intractability\nof computing the partition function in many systems of interest. Emerging\nhardware, such as quantum annealers, provide novel tools for such\ninvestigations, but it is well known that studying general, non-native systems\non such devices requires graph minor embedding, at the expense of introducing\nadditional variables. The effect of embedding for sampling is more pronounced\nthan for optimization; for optimization one is just concerned with the ground\nstate physics, whereas for sampling one needs to consider states at all\nenergies. We argue that as the system size or the embedding size grows, the\nchance of a sample being in the subspace of interest - the logical subspace -\ncan be exponentially suppressed. Though the severity of this scaling can be\nlessened through favorable parameter choices, certain physical constraints\n(such as a fixed temperature and range of couplings) provide hard limits on\nwhat is currently feasible.

However, being\ntoo conservative comes at the cost of rejecting many valid loop closure\ncandidates, which results in less accurate trajectory estimates.

Ternary quantization provides a more flexible model and\noutperforms binary quantization in terms of accuracy, however doubles the\nmemory footprint and increases the computational cost. Contrary to these\napproaches, mixed quantized models allow a trade-off between accuracy and\nmemory footprint. In such models, quantization depth is often chosen manually,\nor is tuned using a separate optimization routine. The latter requires training\na quantized network multiple times.

A conflict group is a collection of cache\nlines which will evict the target cache line. Randomization is often used by\ndefenses to prevent creation of SCGs.\n  We introduce new attacks to demonstrate that the current randomization\nschemes require an extremely high refresh rate to be secure, on average a 15\\%\nperformance overhead, and upto 50\\% in the worst case. Next, we propose a new\nrandomization strategy using an indirection table, which mitigates this issue.\nAddresses of cache lines are encrypted and used to lookup the indirection table\nentry. Each indirection table entry stores a mapping to a randomly chosen cache\nset. The cache line is placed into this randomly chosen set. The encryption key\nchanges upto 50x faster than CEASER's default rate, by using evictions to\ntrigger the re-randomization. Instead of moving cache lines, this mechanism\nre-randomizes one iTable entry at a time, whenever the cache lines\ncorresponding to the iTable entry are naturally evicted. Thus, the miss rate is\nnot much worse than the baseline.\n  We quantitatively show that our scheme does almost as well as a fully\nassociative cache to defend against these attacks.

The result suggests that the spin-current measurement is a promising\nprobe to detect the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-vortex topological transition which has\nremained elusive in experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 13:19:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2020 07:23:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-31"}

In the existing studies of $S$-wave vector-meson photoproduction\nin the literature, such an identification is typically performed in the\nlight-front (LF) frame while the radial component of the meson wave function is\nrather postulated than computed from the first principles. The massive\nphoton-like $V\\to Q\\bar Q$ vertex, besides the $S$-wave component, also\ncontains an extra $D$-wave admixture in the $Q\\bar Q$ rest frame. However, the\nrelative weight of these contributions cannot be justified by any reasonable\nnonrelativistic $Q\\bar Q$ potential model. In this work, we investigate the\nrelative role of the $D$-wave contribution starting from the photon-like\nquarkonium $V\\to Q\\bar Q$ transition in both frames: in the $Q\\bar Q$ rest\nframe (with subsequent Melosh spin transform to the LF frame) and in the LF\nframe (without Melosh transform).

However, we find that the \"$S$-wave only\" transition\nleads to a better description of photoproduction data for excited heavy\nquarkonium states, which represent a more effective tool for study of $D$-wave\neffects. Consequently, the predictions for production of excited states based\non the photon-like structure of $V\\to Q\\bar Q$ transition should be treated\nwith a great care due to a much stronger sensitivity of the $D$-wave\ncontribution to the nodal structure of quarkonium wave functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 08:46:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 2019 12:53:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 15:52:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 08:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

This behaviour is due to the the presence of a persistent large scale\ncirculation flow structure, which induces strong shear at wall boundaries and\nin up/down-welling regions. The near-wall horizontal alignment of rods persists\nat increasing the Rayleigh number, while the vertical orientation in the bulk\nis progressively weakened by the corresponding increase of turbulence\nintensity.

To address these, we substantially extend the largest\navailable in-the-wild database (Aff-Wild) to study continuous emotions such as\nvalence and arousal. Furthermore, we annotate parts of the database with basic\nexpressions and action units. As a consequence, for the first time, this allows\nthe joint study of all three types of behavior states.

At present, unmanned\naerial vehicles (UAV) or drones do not have long flight times and are mainly\nused for monitoring, surveillance, and image post-processing. On the other\nhand, the traditional airship is too large and not easy to take off and land.\nTherefore, we propose to develop an \"Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nDrone-Cruiser\" base station that can help 5G mobile communication systems and\nbeyond quickly recover the network after a disaster and handle the instant\ncommunications by the flash crowd. The drone-cruiser base station can overcome\nthe communications problem for three types of flash crowds, such as in\nstadiums, parades, and large plaza so that an appropriate number of aerial base\nstations can be accurately deployed to meet large and dynamic traffic demands.\nArtificial intelligence can solve these problems by analyzing the collected\ndata, and then adjust the system parameters in the framework of Self-Organizing\nNetwork (SON) to achieve the goals of self-configuration, self-optimization,\nand self-healing. With the help of AI technologies, 5G networks can become more\nintelligent. This paper aims to provide a new type of service, On-Demand Aerial\nBase Station as a Service. This work needs to overcome the following five\ntechnical challenges: innovative design of drone-cruisers for the long-time\nhovering, crowd estimation and prediction, rapid 3D wireless channel learning\nand modeling, 3D placement of aerial base stations and the integration of WiFi\nfront-haul and millimeter wave/WiGig back-haul networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 16:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}
