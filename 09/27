Our work is motivated by the intriguing property that\ndeep networks are surprisingly good at linearizing features, such that certain\ndirections in the deep feature space correspond to meaningful semantic\ntransformations, e.g., adding sunglasses or changing backgrounds. As a\nconsequence, translating training samples along many semantic directions in the\nfeature space can effectively augment the dataset to improve generalization. To\nimplement this idea effectively and efficiently, we first perform an online\nestimate of the covariance matrix of deep features for each class, which\ncaptures the intra-class semantic variations. Then random vectors are drawn\nfrom a zero-mean normal distribution with the estimated covariance to augment\nthe training data in that class. Importantly, instead of augmenting the samples\nexplicitly, we can directly minimize an upper bound of the expected\ncross-entropy (CE) loss on the augmented training set, leading to a highly\nefficient algorithm. In fact, we show that the proposed ISDA amounts to\nminimizing a novel robust CE loss, which adds negligible extra computational\ncost to a normal training procedure.

Larry Guth proved that there\nexists $c(n)$ with the following property: if for some $r>0$ the volume of each\nmetric ball of radius $r$ is less than $({r\\over c(n)})^n$, then there exists a\ncontinuous map from $M^n$ to a $(n-1)$-dimensional simplicial complex such that\nthe inverse image of each point can be covered by a metric ball of radius $r$\nin $M^n$. It was previously proven by Gromov that this result implies two by\nnow famous Gromov's inequalities: $Fill Rad(M^n)\\leq c(n)vol(M^n)^{1\\over n}$\nand, if $M^n$ is essential, then also $sys_1(M^n)\\leq 6c(n)vol(M^n)^{1\\over n}$\nwith the same constant $c(n)$. Here $sys_1(M^n)$ denotes the length of a\nshortest non-contractible closed curve in $M^n$.\n  We prove that these results hold with $c(n)=({n!\\over 2})^{1\\over n}\\leq\n{n\\over 2}$.

Deflating out the lowest eigenvectors or singular\nvectors of the matrix reduces the variance of the trace estimator. This work\nsummarizes our efforts to reduce the computational cost of computing the\ndeflation space while achieving the desired variance reduction for Lattice QCD\napplications. Previous efforts computed the lower part of the singular spectrum\nof the Dirac operator by using an eigensolver preconditioned with a multigrid\nlinear system solver. Despite the improvement in performance in those\napplications, as the problem size grows the runtime and storage demands of this\napproach will eventually dominate the stochastic estimation part of the\ncomputation.\n  In this work, we propose to compute the deflation space in one of the\nfollowing two ways. First, by using an inexact eigensolver on the Hermitian,\nbut maximally indefinite, operator $A \\gamma_5$. Second, by exploiting the fact\nthat the multigrid prolongator for this operator is rich in components toward\nthe lower part of the singular spectrum. We show experimentally that the\ninexact eigensolver can approximate the lower part of the spectrum even for\nill-conditioned operators. Also, the deflation based on the multigrid\nprolongator is more efficient to compute and apply, and, despite its limited\nability to approximate the fine level spectrum, it obtains similar variance\nreduction on the trace estimator as deflating with approximate eigenvectors\nfrom the fine level operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 16:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

Although the\ndevelopment of quantum computers in the near future may enable us to compute\nenergy spectra of classically-intractable systems, methods to simulate the\nGreen's function with near-term quantum algorithms have not been proposed yet.\nHere, we propose two methods to calculate the Green's function of a given\nHamiltonian on near-term quantum computers. The first one makes use of a\nvariational dynamics simulation of quantum systems and computes the dynamics of\nthe Green's function in real time directly. The second one utilizes the Lehmann\nrepresentation of the Green's function and a method which calculates excited\nstates of the Hamiltonian. Both methods require shallow quantum circuits and\nare compatible with near-term quantum computers. We numerically simulated the\nGreen's function of the Fermi-Hubbard model and demonstrated the validity of\nour proposals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 16:57:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 11:09:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 04:34:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2020 10:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

A typical approach to obtain\noptimal policies is to first construct a loss function that is based on the\nscalarization of individual objectives, and then find the optimal policy that\nminimizes the loss. However, optimizing the scalarized (and weighted) loss does\nnot necessarily provide guarantee of high performance on each possibly\nconflicting objective because it is challenging to assign the right weights\nwithout knowing the relationship among these objectives. Moreover, the\neffectiveness of these gradient descent algorithms is limited by the agent's\nability to explain their decisions and actions to human users. The purpose of\nthis study is two-fold. First, we propose a vector value function based\nmulti-objective reinforcement learning (V2f-MORL) approach that seeks to\nquantify the inter-objective relationship via reinforcement learning (RL) when\nthe impact of one objective on others is unknown a prior. In particular, we\nconstruct one actor and multiple critics that can co-learn the policy and\ninter-objective relationship matrix (IORM), quantifying the impact of\nobjectives on each other, in an iterative way. Second, we provide a semantic\nrepresentation that can uncover the trade-off of decision policies made by\nusers to reconcile conflicting objectives based on the proposed V2f-MORL\napproach for the explainability of the generated behaviors subject to given\noptimization objectives. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach via a MuJoCo based robotics case study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 17:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-27"}

In this paper, we use optimal transport to\ncharacterize the minimum possible loss in an adversarial classification\nscenario. In this setting, an adversary receives a random labeled example from\none of two classes, perturbs the example subject to a neighborhood constraint,\nand presents the modified example to the classifier. We define an appropriate\ncost function such that the minimum transportation cost between the\ndistributions of the two classes determines the minimum $0-1$ loss for any\nclassifier. When the classifier comes from a restricted hypothesis class, the\noptimal transportation cost provides a lower bound. We apply our framework to\nthe case of Gaussian data with norm-bounded adversaries and explicitly show\nmatching bounds for the classification and transport problems as well as the\noptimality of linear classifiers. We also characterize the sample complexity of\nlearning in this setting, deriving and extending previously known results as a\nspecial case.

We focus\non scenarios modeled by the Gaussian interfering broadcast channel (IBC),\ncomprising $K$ mutually interfering Gaussian broadcast channels (BCs), each\nformed by a base station communicating independent messages to an arbitrary\nnumber of users. We establish a new power allocation duality between the IBC\nand its dual interfering multiple access channel (IMAC), which entails that the\ncorresponding generalized degrees-of-freedom regions achieved through\nmulti-cell TIN and power control (TINA regions) for both networks are\nidentical. As by-products of this duality, we obtain an explicit\ncharacterization of the IBC TINA region from a previously established\ncharacterization of the IMAC TINA region; and identify a multi-cell convex-TIN\nregime in which the IBC TINA region is a polyhedron (hence convex) without the\nneed for time-sharing. We then identify a smaller multi-cell TIN regime in\nwhich the IBC TINA region is optimal and multi-cell TIN achieves the entire\ncapacity region of the IBC, up to a constant gap. This is accomplished by\nderiving a new genie-aided outer bound for the IBC, that reveals a novel\nBC-type order that holds amongst users in each constituent BC (or cell) under\ninter-cell interference, which in turn is not implied by previously known\nBC-type orders (i.e. degraded, less noisy and more capable orders). The\nmulti-cell TIN regime that we identify for the IBC coincides with a\ncorresponding multi-cell TIN regime previously identified for the IMAC, hence\nestablishing a comprehensive uplink-downlink duality of multi-cell TIN in the\nGDoF (and approximate capacity) sense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 17:34:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-27"}

Since programs can access more data than they legitimately\nneed, flaws in security checks at the application level can enable malicious or\nbuggy code to view or modify data in violation of intended access control\npolicies.\n  Inquiry: Although database management systems provide tools to control access\nto data, these tools are not well-suited for modern applications which often\nhave many users and consist of many different software components. First,\ndatabases are unaware of application users, and creating a new database user\nfor each application user is impractical for applications with many users.\nSecond, different components of the same application may require different\nauthority, which would require creating different database users for different\nsoftware components. Thus, it is difficult to use existing tools to properly\nlimit the authority an application has when executing queries. For this reason,\nwe consider a new, language-based approach to application-specific database\nsecurity.\n  Approach: Prior work has addressed the difficulty of running applications\nwith least privilege using capability-based security and software contracts,\nwhich we adapt to the setting of database-backed applications.\n  Knowledge: This paper's main contribution is the design and implementation of\nShillDB, a language for writing secure database-backed applications. ShillDB\nenables reasoning about database access at the language level through\ncapabilities, which limit which database tables a program can access, and\ncontracts, which limit what operations a program can perform on those tables.\nShillDB contracts are expressed as part of function interfaces, making it easy\nto specify different access control policies for different components.\nContracts act as executable security documentation for ShillDB programs and are\nenforced by the language runtime. Further, ShillDB provides database access\ncontrol guarantees independent of (and in addition to) the security mechanisms\nof the underlying database management system.\n  Grounding: We have implemented a prototype of ShillDB and have used it to\nimplement the backend for a lending library reservation system with contracts\nfor each endpoint to evaluate the performance and usability of ShillDB.\nFurther, we benchmark individual database operations in ShillDB to better\nunderstand the language's performance overhead.\n  Importance: Our experience indicates that ShillDB is a practical language for\nenforcing database access control policies in realistic, multi-user\napplications and has reasonable performance overhead. ShillDB allows developers\nto reason about security at the component level, safely compose components, and\nreuse third-party components with their own application-specific database\nsecurity policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 17:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-27"}

Lastly, multivariate model performance was evaluated on the\nbootstrapped validation cohort using the area under receiver operating\ncharacteristic curve (AUC). Results: Univariate analysis demonstrated that\namong different image sets, 128 bin discretized images have statistically\nsignificant different (q-value < 0.05) texture parameters with a mean of AUC\n0.74 (q-value < 0.05). The three ML-based classifier shows proficient\ndiscrimination of the high from low-grade ccRCC. The AUC was 0.78 in logistic\nregression, 0.62 in random forest, and 0.83 in SVM model, respectively.\nConclusion: Radiomics features can be a useful and promising non-invasive\nmethod for preoperative evaluation of ccRCC Fuhrman grades.

The problem is that the model is unlikely to recover from its\nmistakes during inference, where the reference output is replaced by generated\noutput. Several approaches deal with this problem, largely by guiding the model\nwith generated output history. To make training stable, these approaches often\nrequire a heuristic schedule or an auxiliary classifier.

State-of-the-art encoding models use a single global model\n(linear or non-linear) to predict brain activation given the stimulus. However,\nthe critical assumption in these methods is that a priori different brain\nregions respond the same way to all the stimuli, that is, there is no\nmodularity or specialization assumed for any region. This goes against the\nmodularity theory, supported by many cognitive neuroscience investigations\nsuggesting that there are functionally specialized regions in the brain.

We find that\nthe degree of delay interacts with the learning rate, to change the set of\nminima accessible by an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent algorithm. We\nderive closed-form rules on how the learning rate could be changed, while\nkeeping the accessible set the same. Specifically, for high delay values, we\nfind that the learning rate should be kept inversely proportional to the delay.\nWe then extend this analysis to include momentum. We find momentum should be\neither turned off, or modified to improve training stability. We provide\nempirical experiments to validate our theoretical findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 19:05:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 13:06:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-14"}

In this paper we study a\npartially delocalized probe construction, in which the point probe is replaced\nwith a continuous line, creating a sensor which essentially acquires line\nintegrals of the target image. We show through simulations, rudimentary\ntheoretical analysis, and experiments, that these line measurements can image\nsparse samples far more efficiently than traditional point measurements,\nprovided the local features in the sample are enough separated. Despite this\npromise, practical reconstruction from line measurements poses additional\ndifficulties: the measurements are partially coherent, and real measurements\nexhibit nonidealities.

We use stochastic series\nexpansion (SSE) quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) to investigate the nature of this\ntransition as $\\lambda$ is varied - here we present studies for\n$\\lambda=0,0.5,0.75,0.85,0.95$ and $1$. While we find that the first order\ntransition weakens as $\\lambda$ is increased from 0 to 1, we find no evidence\nthat the transition becomes continuous until the SU(2) symmetric point,\n$\\lambda=1$. We thus conclude that the square lattice superfluid-VBS transition\nin the two-component easy-plane model is generically first order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 19:48:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 04:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

This study aims to understand the physical origin\nof the IR excess found in the spectral energy distribution (SED) of 5 Cepheids\n: RS Pup (P=41.46d), zeta Gem (P=10.15d), eta Aql (P=7.18d), V Cen (P=5.49d)\nand SU Cyg (P=3.85d). A time series of atmospheric models along the pulsation\ncycle are fitted to a compilation of data, including optical and near-IR\nphotometry, Spitzer spectra (secured at a specific phase), interferometric\nangular diameters, effective temperature and radial velocity measurements.\nHerschel images in two bands are also analyzed qualitatively. In this fitting\nprocess, based on the SPIPS algorithm, a residual is found in the SED, whatever\nthe pulsation phase, and for wavelengths larger than about $1.2\\mu$m, which\ncorresponds to the so-determined infrared excess of Cepheids. This IR excess is\nthen corrected from interstellar medium absorption in order to infer or not the\npresence of dust shells, and is finally used in order to fit a model of a shell\nof ionized gas. For all Cepheids, we find a continuum IR excess increasing up\nto about -0.1 magnitudes at 30$\\mu$m, which cannot be explained by a hot or\ncold dust model of CircumStellar Environment (CSE). We show, for the first\ntime, that the IR excess of Cepheids can be explained by free-free emission\nfrom a thin shell of ionized gas, with a thickness of about 15% of the star\nradius, a mass of $10^{-9}-10^{-7}$ Msol and a temperature ranging from 3500 to\n4500K. This result has to be tested with interferometers operating in visible,\nin the mid-IR or in the radio domain. The impact of such CSEs of ionized gas on\nthe PL relation of Cepheids needs also more investigations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 20:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

The main assumption of various SSL algorithms is that the\nnearby points on the data manifold are likely to share a label. Graph-based SSL\nconstructs a graph from point-cloud data as an approximation to the underlying\nmanifold, followed by label inference. It is no surprise that the quality of\nthe constructed graph in capturing the essential structure of the data is\ncritical to the accuracy of the subsequent inference step [6]. How should one\nconstruct a graph from the input point-cloud data for graph-based SSL? In this\nwork we introduce a new, parallel graph learning framework (called PG-learn)\nfor the graph construction step of SSL. Our solution has two main ingredients:\n(1) a gradient-based optimization of the edge weights (more specifically,\ndifferent kernel bandwidths in each dimension) based on a validation loss\nfunction, and (2) a parallel hyperparameter search algorithm with an adaptive\nresource allocation scheme. In essence, (1) allows us to search around a\n(random) initial hyperparameter configuration for a better one with lower\nvalidation loss. Since the search space of hyperparameters is huge for\nhigh-dimensional problems, (2) empowers our gradient-based search to go through\nas many different initial configurations as possible, where runs for relatively\nunpromising starting configurations are terminated early to allocate the time\nfor others. As such, PG-learn is a carefully-designed hybrid of random and\nadaptive search. Through experiments on multi-class classification problems, we\nshow that PG-learn significantly outperforms a variety of existing graph\nconstruction schemes in accuracy (per fixed time budget for hyperparameter\ntuning), and scales more effectively to high dimensional problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 20:59:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-30"}

Since\nthe expansion described by this solution does not present a transition from a\ndecelerated phase to an accelerated one, both phases can be well modeled\nconnecting both phases by requiring the continuity of the Hubble parameter at\n$z=z_{t}$, the accelerated-decelerated transition redshift. Our best fit\nconstrains the main free parameters of the model to be $A_1=\n1.58^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ ($A_2=0.84^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$) for the accelerated\n(decelerated) phase.

Projection-based quantum embedding methodologies provide a\nrigorous framework for performing DFT-in-DFT and wave function in DFT\n(WF-in-DFT) calculations. The use of absolute localization, where the density\nof each subsystem is expanded in only the basis functions associated with the\natoms of that subsystem, provide improved computationally efficiency for\nWF-in-DFT calculations by reducing the number of orbitals in the WF\ncalculation. In this work, we extend absolutely localized projection-based\nquantum embedding to study localized excited states using EOM-CCSD-in-DFT and\nTDDFT-in-DFT. The embedding results are highly accurate compared to the\ncorresponding canonical EOM-CCSD and TDDFT results on the full system, with\nTDDFT-in-DFT frequently more accurate than canonical TDDFT. The absolute\nlocalization method is shown to eliminate the spurious low-lying excitation\nenergies for charge transfer states and prevent over delocalization of excited\nstates. Additionally, we attempt to recover the environment response caused by\nthe electronic excitations in the high-level subsystem using different schemes\nand compare their accuracy. Finally, we apply this method to the calculation of\nthe excited state energy of green fluorescent protein and show that we\nsystematically converge to the full system results. Here we demonstrate how\nthis method can be useful in understanding excited states, specifically which\nchemical moieties polarize to the excitation.

The highly efficient\nmagnetoelectric composite FeGa/PMN-PZT demonstrates drastic modifications of\nthe in-plane magnetic anisotropy, with an almost 90$^{\\circ}$ rotation of the\npreferential anisotropy axis in the thinner films under an electric field E =\n10.8 kV.cm$^{-1}$. Also, the influence of thermal strain on the bilayer's\nmagnetic coercivity is compared to that of a reference bilayer FeGa/Glass at\ncryogenic temperatures. A different evolution is observed as a function of\ntemperature, revealing a substrate thermo-mechanical influence which has not\nyet been reported in FeGa thin films coupled to a piezoelectric material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 23:18:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

In this paper, we propose a novel trust management\nmechanism in the SIoT to predict the most reliable service providers for each\nservice requestor, which leads to reduce the risk of being exposed to malicious\nnodes. We model the SIoT with a flexible bipartite graph (containing two sets\nof nodes: service providers and service requestors), then build a social\nnetwork among the service requestor nodes, using the Hellinger distance.\nAfterward, we develop a social trust model using nodes' centrality and\nsimilarity measures to extract trust behaviors among the social network nodes.\nFinally, a matrix factorization technique is designed to extract latent\nfeatures of SIoT nodes, find trustworthy nodes, and mitigate the data sparsity\nand cold start problems. We analyze the effect of parameters in the proposed\ntrust prediction mechanism on prediction accuracy. The results indicate that\nfeedbacks from the neighboring nodes of a specific service requestor with high\nHellinger similarity in our mechanism outperforms the best existing methods.

Depending on the ways of\nexploiting the preview information and enforcing the OTC constraint, different\nMPCs are developed based on solving different variations of the general CECO\nproblem. The CECO-based MPCs are then tested in simulation using an automotive\nA/C system simulation model (CoolSim) as the virtual testbed. The simulation\nresults show that, over SC03 driving cycle, the proposed CECO-based MPCs\noutperform the baseline cabin temperature tracking controller, reducing the A/C\nsystem energy consumption by up to 7.6%, while achieving better OTC according\nto the PMV-based metrics. This energy saving in A/C system translates to 3.1%\nvehicle fuel economy improvement. The trade-off between energy efficiency and\nOTC for different control scenarios is also highlighted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 00:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-30"}

Current multivariate analysis paints diverse causal risk profiles that\nvary with time. However, these profiles evolve and a universal model to\nunderstand that evolution remains absent. Most of the current conflict analysis\nis data-driven and conducted at the individual country or region level, often\nin isolation. Consistent consideration of multi-scale interactions and their\nnon-linear dynamics is missing. Here, we develop a multiplexed network model,\nwhere each city is modelled as a non-linear bi-stable system with stable states\nin either war or peace. The causal factor categories which exasperate the risk\nof conflict are each modelled as a network layer. We consider 3 layers: (1)\ncore geospatial network of interacting cities reflecting ground level\ninteractions, (2) cultural network of interacting countries reflecting cultural\ngroupings, and (3) political network of interacting countries reflecting\nalliances. Together, they act as drivers to push cities towards or pull cities\naway from war.

We argue that in solving real-world problems, especially when the\ntask is designed by humans, and/or for humans, there are typically instructions\nfrom user manuals and/or human experts which give guidelines on how to better\naccomplish the tasks. We argue that these instructions have tremendous value in\ndesigning a reinforcement learning system which can learn in human fashion, and\nwe test the idea by playing the Atari games Tennis and Pong. We experimentally\ndemonstrate that the instructions provide key information about the task, which\ncan be used to decompose the learning task into sub-systems and construct\noptions for the temporally extended planning, and dramatically accelerate the\nlearning process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 02:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-30"}

However, this\ndefault metric suffers from ambiguity, and worse, all augmentations of\nmodularity and based on a narrow intuition of what it means to form a\n\"community\". We argue that in specific, but quite common systems, links within\na community are not necessarily more common than links between communities.\nInstead we propose that the defining characteristic of a community is that\nlinks are more predictable within a community rather than between communities.\nIn this paper, based on the effect of communities on link prediction, we\npropose a novel metric for the community detection based directly on this\nfeature. We find that our metric is more robustness than traditional\nmodularity. Consequently, we can achieve an evaluation of algorithm stability\nfor the same detection algorithm in different networks.

Regarding\nthe Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem, we show that \\begin{align*} \\sum_{|\\ell|\\leq\nx}(4x^2-4\\ell^2)^{2r}-\\sum_{|\\ell|<x}(4x^2-(2\\ell+1)^2)^{2r}=\\text{polynomial\nw.r.t. } x \\text{ with degree }2r-1. \\end{align*} This can perhaps be proved\nusing properties of Bernoulli polynomials, but the claim fell out of our method\nin a more natural and motivated way.

We propose a differentiable matching layer by unrolling\na projected gradient descent algorithm in which the projection exploits the\nDykstra's algorithm. We prove that under mild conditions, the matching is\nguaranteed to converge to the optimum. In practice, it performs similarly to\nthe Hungarian algorithm during inference.

Multiple modalities can be used in this case, the advantage is that\nother modalities can compensate for occlusion, noise, and sensor malfunctions.\nEven though deciding the utilization rate of a modality (referred to as\nreliability value) corresponding to the situations is important, the manual\ndesign of such models is difficult, especially for various situations.

The adaptive\nreconciliation is necessary and important for practical systems to cope with\nthe variable channel. Many researchers adopt the punctured LDPC codes to\nimplement adaptive reconciliation. In this paper, a novel rateless\nreconciliation protocol based on spinal code is proposed, which can achieve a\nhigh-efficiency and adaptive reconciliation in a larger range of SNRs. Due to\nthe short codes length and simple tructure, our protocol is easy to implement\nwithout the complex codes designs of fixed rate codes, e.g., LDPC codes.\nMeanwhile, the structure of our protocol is highly parallel, which is suitable\nfor hardware implementation, thus it also has the potential of high-speed\nhardware implementation. Besides, the security of proposed protocol is proved\nin theory. Experiment results show that the reconciliation efficiency maintains\naround 95% for ranging SNRs in a larger range (0,0.5), even exceeds 96.5% at\nextremely low SNR (<= 0.03) by using this novel scheme.

Modelling efforts on\necosystems' dynamical stability have revealed that population dynamics, being\nhighly nonlinear, can be governed by complex fluctuations. Indeed, experimental\nand field research has provided mounting evidence of chaos in species'\nabundances, especially for discrete-time systems. Discrete-time dynamics,\nmainly arising in boreal and temperate ecosystems for species with\nnon-overlapping generations, have been largely studied to understand the\ndynamical outcomes due to changes in relevant ecological parameters. The local\nand global dynamical behaviour of many of these models is difficult to\ninvestigate analytically in the parameter space and, typically, numerical\napproaches are employed when the dimension of the phase space is large. In this\narticle we provide topological and dynamical results for a map modelling a\ndiscrete-time, three-species food chain with two predator species interacting\non the same prey population. The domain where dynamics live is characterized,\nas well as the so-called escaping regions, for which the species go rapidly to\nextinction after surpassing the carrying capacity. We also provide a full\ndescription of the local stability of equilibria within a volume of the\nparameter space given by the prey's growth rate and the predation rates. We\nhave found that the increase of the pressure of predators on the prey results\nin chaos. The entry into chaos is achieved via a supercritical Neimarck-Sacker\nbifurcation followed by period-doubling bifurcations of invariant curves.\nInterestingly, an increasing predation directly on preys can shift the\nextinction of top predators to their survival, allowing an unstable persistence\nof the three species by means of periodic and strange chaotic attractors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 05:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

And most of the existing methods adopt stacks of local\nconvolutions or non-local blocks to capture long-range context. However, due to\nthe absence of spatial structure preservation, these operators ignore the\nobject details when enlarging receptive fields. In this paper, we propose the\nlearnable tree filter to form a generic tree filtering module that leverages\nthe structural property of minimal spanning tree to model long-range\ndependencies while preserving the details. Furthermore, we propose a highly\nefficient linear-time algorithm to reduce resource consumption. Thus, the\ndesigned modules can be plugged into existing deep neural networks\nconveniently. To this end, tree filtering modules are embedded to formulate a\nunified framework for semantic segmentation. We conduct extensive ablation\nstudies to elaborate on the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed\nmethod. Specifically, it attains better performance with much less overhead\ncompared with the classic PSP block and Non-local operation under the same\nbackbone.

Possible world based algorithms seem promising for\nclustering uncertain data.

(2) They\ndo not well utilize the consistency among possible worlds, since they conduct\nclustering or construct the affinity matrix on each possible world\nindependently. In this paper, we propose a representative possible world based\nconsistent clustering (RPC) algorithm for uncertain data. First, by introducing\nrepresentative loss and using Jensen-Shannon divergence as the distribution\nmeasure, we design a heuristic strategy for the selection of representative\npossible worlds, thus avoiding the negative effects caused by marginal possible\nworlds. Second, we integrate a consistency learning procedure into spectral\nclustering to deal with the representative possible worlds synergistically,\nthus utilizing the consistency to achieve better performance.

Recent work proposed\nidentifiable generative modelling using variational autoencoders (iVAE) with a\ntheory of identifiability. Due to the intractablity of KL divergence between\nvariational approximate posterior and the true posterior, however, iVAE has to\nmaximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the marginal likelihood, leading to\nsuboptimal solutions in both theory and practice. In contrast, we propose an\nidentifiable framework for estimating latent representations using a flow-based\nmodel (iFlow).

To show how to optimize the FL performance using\nthis proposed scheme, we consider an existing FL framework as an example and\ntarget FL training time minimization for this framework. An optimization\nproblem is then formulated to jointly optimize the local accuracy, transmit\npower, data rate, and users' processing frequency. This mixed-timescale\nstochastic nonconvex problem captures the complex interactions among the\ntraining time, and transmission and computation of training updates of one FL\nprocess. By employing the online successive convex approximation approach, we\ndevelop a new algorithm to solve the formulated problem with proven convergence\nto the neighbourhood of its stationary points.

This caveat has motivated the introduction of analytical\nrelativistic hydrodynamics (RH) solutions with transverse expansion, in\nparticular, the 3+1 self-similar (SSF) and Gubser flows. Inspired by recent\ngeneralizations of the Bjorken flow to the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics\n(RMHD), we present a procedure for a generalization of RH solutions to RMHD.\nOur method is mainly based on symmetry arguments. Using this method, we find\nthe relation between RH degrees of freedom and the magnetic field evolution in\nthe ideal limit for an infinitely conductive fluid, and determine the proper\ntime dependence of the magnetic field in aforementioned flows. In the case of\nSSF, a family of solutions are found that are related through a certain\ndifferential equation. To find the magnetic field evolution in the Gubser flow,\nwe solve RMHD equations for a stationary fluid in a conformally flat\n$dS^3\\times E^1$ spacetime. The result is then Weyl transformed back into the\nMinkowski spacetime. In this case, the temporal evolution of the magnetic field\nexhibits a transmission between $1/t$ to $1/t^3$ near the center of the\ncollision. The longitudinal component of the magnetic field is found to be\nsensitive to the transverse size of the fluid. We also find the radial\nevolution of the magnetic field for both flows. The radial domain of validity\nin the case of SSF is highly restricted, in contrast to the Gubser flow. A\ncomparison of the results suggests that the Gubser RMHD may give a more\nappropriate qualitative picture of the magnetic field decay in the quark-gluon\nplasma (QGP).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 09:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-30"}

This can for example model\na situation where the asset price is partially controlled by a company which\nintervenes when the price is reaching a certain lower barrier. See e.g. Jarrow\n& Protter for an explanation and discussion of this model in the Brownian\nmotion case. As already pointed out by Karatzas & Shreve (in the continuous\nsetting), this allows for arbitrages in the market. However, the situation in\nthe case of jumps is not clear. Moreover, it is not clear what happens if there\nis a delay in the system.\n  In this paper we consider a jump diffusion market model with a singular drift\nterm modelled as the local time of a given process, and with a delay \\theta>0\nin the information flow available for the trader. We allow the stock price\ndynamics to depend on both a continuous process (Brownian motion) and a jump\nprocess (Poisson random measure). We believe that jumps and delays are\nessential in order to get more realistic financial market models.\n  Using white noise calculus we compute explicitly the optimal consumption rate\nand portfolio in this case and we show that the maximal value is finite as long\nas the delay \\theta> 0. This implies that there is no arbitrage in the market\nin that case. However, when \\theta goes to 0, the value goes to infinity. This\nis in agreement with the above result that is an arbitrage when there is no\ndelay.\n  Our model is also relevant for high frequency trading issues. This is because\nhigh frequency trading often leads to intensive trading taking place on close\nto infinitesimal lengths of time, which in the limit corresponds to trading on\ntime sets of measure 0. This may in turn lead to a singular drift in the\npricing dynamics.

In\nthis work, we find that pre-training an over-parameterized model is not\nnecessary for obtaining the target pruned structure.

We used Fourier holographic principle to acquire a\ndiverse set of holograms, which were either computer-generated from point\nclouds or optically recorded from real macroscopic objects. A final public data\nset comprising 96 holograms was created using three compression methods which\nencoded the holograms at four bit-depths. Three separate subjective-tests were\nconducted using a holographic display, a light field display and a 2D display.\nFor these subjective experiments, a double stimulus, multi-perspective,\nmulti-depth subjective testing methodology was designed and implemented. The\ntests show that the non-holographic displays indicate a higher sensitivity to\nartifacts than the holographic display, though at the same time it is\ndemonstrated they are highly correlated.

Specifically, we analyze the performance of different active\nlearning techniques employing several sampling and disagreement strategies.\nMoreover, we collect a large-scale dataset covering images from eight common\ntypes of natural disasters. The experimental results show that the use of\nactive learning techniques for disaster analysis using images results in a\nperformance comparable to that obtained using human annotated images, and could\nbe used in frameworks for disaster analysis in images without tedious job of\nmanual annotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 10:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-30"}

As organisations change in size, complexity and structure, the\nsystem dynamics also change. Here, we consider majority rule dynamics on\norganisations modelled as hierarchical directed graphs, where the directed\nedges indicate influence. We utilise a topological measure called the trophic\nincoherence parameter, q, which effectively gauges the stratification of power\nstructure in an organisation. We show that this measure bounds regimes of\nbehaviour. There is fast consensus at low q (e.g. tyranny), slow consensus at\nmid q (e.g. democracy), and no consensus at high q (e.g. anarchy). These\nregimes are investigated analytically, numerically and empirically with diverse\ncase studies in the Roman Army, US Government, and a healthcare organisation.\nOur work demonstrates the usefulness of the trophic incoherence parameter when\nconsidering models of social influence dynamics, with widespread consequences\nin the design and analysis of organisations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 10:30:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 12:38:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 15:47:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

It has 1) a detection model for target\nlocalization and 2) an appearance embedding model for data association. Having\nthe two models separately executed might lead to efficiency problems, as the\nrunning time is simply a sum of the two steps without investigating potential\nstructures that can be shared between them. Existing research efforts on\nreal-time MOT usually focus on the association step, so they are essentially\nreal-time association methods but not real-time MOT system. In this paper, we\npropose an MOT system that allows target detection and appearance embedding to\nbe learned in a shared model. Specifically, we incorporate the appearance\nembedding model into a single-shot detector, such that the model can\nsimultaneously output detections and the corresponding embeddings. We further\npropose a simple and fast association method that works in conjunction with the\njoint model. In both components the computation cost is significantly reduced\ncompared with former MOT systems, resulting in a neat and fast baseline for\nfuture follow-ups on real-time MOT algorithm design.

Distortion of structural (Delaunay) tetrahedra is studied by two\nparameters, which show some similarities and some differences in terms of\noverall tendencies.

For the first problem of sample\ninsufficiency, we show theoretically and empirically that the batchsize of the\ntraining samples in practice may be insufficient for the discriminator to learn\nan accurate discrimination function. It could result in unstable training\ndynamics for the generator, leading to anomalous generalization. For the second\nproblem of pixel-wise combination, we find that besides recognizing the\npositive training samples as real, under certain circumstances, the\ndiscriminator could be fooled to recognize the pixel-wise combinations (e.g.\npixel-wise average) of the positive training samples as real. However, those\ncombinations could be visually different from the real samples in the target\ndistribution. With the fooled discriminator as reference, the generator would\nobtain biased supervision further, leading to the anomalous generalization\nbehaviour.

When computing the transit radius as a function of\nwavelength, one needs to specify a reference transit radius corresponding to a\nreference pressure. Mathematically, the reference transit radius is a constant\nof integration that originates from evaluating an integral for the transit\ndepth. Physically, its interpretation has been debated in the literature.\nJordan & Espinoza (2018) suggested that the optical depth is discontinuous\nacross, and infinite below, the reference transit radius. Betremieux & Swain\n(2017, 2018) interpreted the spherical surface located at the reference transit\nradius to represent the boundary associated with an opaque cloud deck. It is\ndemonstrated that continuous functions for the optical depth may be found. The\noptical depth below and at the reference transit radius need not take on\nspecial or divergent values. In the limit of a spatially uniform grey cloud\nwith constant opacity, the transit chord with optical depth on the order of\nunity mimics the presence of a \"cloud top\". While the surface located at the\nreference pressure may mimic the presence of grey clouds, it is more natural to\ninclude the effects of these clouds as part of the opacity function because the\ncloud opacity may be computed from first principles. It is unclear how this\nmimicry extends to non-grey clouds comprising small particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 12:05:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

Therefore, the formulation is\nmore general than classical ones as it does not rely on parametrizations\nimplying curvilinear coordinate systems and the concept of co- and\ncontravariant base vectors. This leads to the third unification: TDC-based\nmodels are applicable to two fundamentally different numerical approaches.

OBDDs are also known as special cases of\noblivious read-once branching programs in the field of complexity theory. Since\nOBDDs have many nice properties as data structures, they have been extensively\nstudied for decades in both theoretical and practical fields, such as VLSI\ndesign, formal verification, machine learning, and combinatorial problems.\nArguably, the most crucial problem in using OBDDs is that they may vary\nexponentially in size depending on their variable ordering (i.e., the order in\nwhich the variable are to read) when they represent the same function. Indeed,\nit is NP hard to find an optimal variable ordering that minimizes an OBDD for a\ngiven function. Hence, numerous studies have sought heuristics to find an\noptimal variable ordering. From practical as well as theoretical points of\nview, it is also important to seek algorithms that output optimal solutions\nwith lower (exponential) time complexity than trivial brute-force algorithms\ndo. Friedman and Supowit provided a clever deterministic algorithm with\ntime/space complexity $O^\\ast(3^n)$, where $n$ is the number of variables of\nthe function, which is much better than the trivial brute-force bound\n$O^\\ast(n!2^n)$.

Moreover,\nthis algorithm can be adapted to constructing other minimum decision diagrams\nsuch as zero-suppressed BDDs, which provide compact representations of sparse\nsets and are often used in the field of discrete optimization and enumeration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 12:52:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 04:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

It limits the capacity of system installations, it\nrequires large cooling infrastructures, and it is the cause of a large carbon\nfootprint. Reducing power during application execution without changing the\napplication source code or increasing time-to-completion is highly desirable in\nreal-life high-performance computing scenarios. The power management run-time\nframeworks proposed in the last decade are based on the assumption that the\nduration of communication and application phases in an MPI application can be\npredicted and used at run-time to trade-off communication slack with power\nconsumption. In this manuscript, we first show that this assumption is too\ngeneral and leads to mispredictions, slowing down applications, thereby\njeopardizing the claimed benefits.

Hence, iCOMs are major actors\nin the increasing molecular complexity in space and they might have played a\nrole in the origin of terrestrial life. Understand-ing how iCOMs are formed is\nrelevant for predicting the ultimate organic chemistry reached in the\ninterstellar medium. One possibility is that they are synthesized on the\ninterstellar grain icy surfaces, via recombination of previously formed\nradicals.

The aim is to verify if it is appropriate to\nuse Milky Way dust properties to derive dust masses in external galaxies.\nMethods: We used Herschel observations and atomic and molecular gas masses to\nestimate the disc-averaged dust emissivity at 250 micrometres, and from this,\nthe absorption cross section per H atom and per dust mass. The emissivity\nrequires one assumption, which is the CO-to-H_2 conversion factor, and the dust\ntemperature is additionally required for the absorption cross section per H\natom; yet another constraint on the dust-to-hydrogen ratio D/H, depending on\nmetallicity, is required for the absorption cross section dust mass. Results:\nWe find epsilon(250) = 0.82 +/- 0.07 MJy sr^-1 (1E20 H cm^-2)^-1 for galaxies\nwith 4 < F(250)/F(500) < 5. This depends only weakly on the adopted CO-to-H_2\nconversion factor. The value is almost the same as that for the Milky Way at\nthe same colour ratio. Instead, for F(250)/F(500) > 6, epsilon(250) is lower\nthan predicted by its dependence on the heating conditions. The reduction\nsuggests a variation in dust emission properties for spirals of earlier type,\nhigher metallicity, and with a higher fraction of molecular gas. When the\nstandard emission properties of Galactic cirrus are used for these galaxies,\ntheir dust masses might be underestimated by up to a factor of two. Values for\nthe absorption cross sections at the Milky Way metallicity are also close to\nthose of the cirrus. Mild trends of the absorption cross sections with\nmetallicity are found, although the results depend on the assumptions made.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 13:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

This tensor derives from a\ngauge field with mixed Yound symmetry (D-3,1) called the \"dual graviton\" field.\nThe dual graviton field is related non-locally to the Pauli-Fierz field (even\non-shell), in much the same way as a p-form potential and its dual (D-p-2)-form\npotential are related in the theory of an abelian p-form.

One important distinction is whether or not to\nassume that both objects are neutron stars and obey the same equation of state.\nSome studies assumed independent properties. Others assume a universal equation\nof state, and in addition that the tidal deformability follows certain\nphenomenological relations. An important question is whether the\ngravitational-wave data alone constitute observational evidence for finite\ntidal effects. All studies provide Bayesian credible intervals, often without\nsufficiently discussing the impact of prior assumptions, especially in the case\nof lower limits on the neutron-star tidal deformability or radius. In this\narticle, we scrutinize the implicit and explicit prior assumptions made in\nthose studies. Our findings strongly indicate that existing lower credible\nbounds are mainly a consequence of prior assumptions combined with information\ngained about the system's masses. Importantly, those lower bounds are typically\nnot informed by the observation of tidal effects in the gravitational-wave\nsignal. Thus, regarding them as observational evidence might be misleading\nwithout a more detailed discussion. Further, we point out technical problems\nand conceptual inconsistencies in existing studies. We also assess the\nlimitations due to systematic waveform model uncertainties in a novel way,\ndemonstrating that differences between existing models are not guaranteed to be\nsmall enough for an unbiased estimation of lower bounds on the tidal\ndeformability.

In these cases, traditional ensemble\nfluorescence measurements are confounded by heterogeneity, whereas individual\ndefect-by-defect studies are impractical. Here, we develop a method to\nquantitatively and systematically analyze the properties of heterogeneous\nemitter ensembles using large-area photoluminescence maps. We apply this method\nto study the effects of sample treatments on emitters in hexagonal boron\nnitride, and we find that low-energy (3 keV) electron irradiation creates\nemitters, whereas high-temperature (850 $^\\circ$C) annealing in an inert gas\nenvironment brightens emitters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 14:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-13"}

Our navigation approach allows the robot to follow the\ncrop-rows accurately and handles the switch to the next row seamlessly within\nthe same framework. We implemented our approach using C++ and ROS and\nthoroughly tested it in several simulated environments with different shapes\nand sizes of field.

However, the representations learned in DNNs are\ntypically hard to interpret, especially in dense layers. One crucial issue of\nthe classical DNN model such as multilayer perceptron (MLP) is that neurons in\nthe same layer of DNNs are conditionally independent of each other, which makes\nco-training and emergence of higher modularity difficult. In contrast to DNNs,\nbiological neurons in mammalian brains display substantial dependency patterns.\nSpecifically, biological neural networks encode representations by so-called\nneuronal assemblies: groups of neurons interconnected by strong synaptic\ninteractions and sharing joint semantic content. The resulting population\ncoding is essential for human cognitive and mnemonic processes.

During the process, a resin fills the cavity where a\nreinforcement fabric has previously been layered. This resin undergoes a\nchemical reaction which is thermically activated. Therefore, assuring a proper\nreaction requires a precise control of temperature in the entire mold cavity.\nThree factors make this control problem especially hard: the coupling among the\nlarge number of actuators and sensors, the variability of the test conditions\nand the power limitations of the electric actuators which do not offer cooling\ncapability. The present work describes an optimized Model Predictive Control\n(MPC) architecture capable of handling these difficulties and also achieving\nthe tight control requirements needed in the application. The thermal\ndistribution inside the mold cavity is included into the controller by a\nsimplified Reduced Order Model (ROM). This representation is obtained by data\nfrom an experimentally validated Finite Element Model (FEM), using\nAutoRegressive model with eXogenous terms (ARX) identification. In order to\nmaintain the simplicity of this linear representation, the time-varying model\nparameters are estimated by using a perturbation observer. Additionally, the\nperformance of the basic algorithm is improved: firstly, an augmented observer\nto estimate the temperature distribution of an extended spatial resolution; and\nsecondly, a symmetry condition in the calculation of the control commands. The\ndeveloped architectures have successfully been implemented in a RTM tool with\nthe fulfillment of the control requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 09:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-03"}

We argue not only that such a relation exists, but that it also bears\nstrong implications both for the interpretations of quantum mechanics and for\nour understanding of consciousness. The paper consists of three parts. In the\nfirst part, we formulate a \"no-go-theorem\" stating that a brain, functioning\nsolely on the principles of classical physics, cannot have any greater ability\nto induce subjective experience than a process of writing (printing) a certain\nsequence of digits. The goal is to show, with an attempt to mathematical rigor,\nwhy the physicalist standpoint based on classical physics is not likely to ever\nexplain the phenomenon of consciousness -- justifying the tendency to look\nbeyond the physics of the 19th century. In the second part, we aim to establish\na clear relation, with a sort of correspondence mapping, between attitudes\ntowards the hard problem and interpretations of quantum mechanics. Then we\ndiscuss these connections in the light of the no-go theorem, pointing out that\nthe existence of subjective experience might differentiate between otherwise\nexperimentally indistinguishable interpretations.
