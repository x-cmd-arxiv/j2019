The root cause for these attacks is mutually\ndistrusting processes sharing cache entries and accessing them in a\ndeterministic manner.

However, they either degrade performance significantly, impose\nimpractical restrictions, or can only defeat certain classes of these attacks.\nMore importantly, they assume that side-channel-resilient caches are required\nfor the entire execution workload and do not allow to selectively enable the\nmitigation only for the security-critical portion of the workload.

We then construct holomorphic\nVOAs by adjoining such modules to $V^G$. Applying these methods to extremal\nlattices in $d=48$ and $d=72$, we construct more than fifty new holomorphic\nVOAs of central charge 48 and 72, many of which have a very small number of\nlight states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 17:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-23"}

For high surface density disks, such as those found around\nblack holes accreting near the Eddington mass accretion limit, the magnitude of\nthis energy dissipation can be larger than the mean scatterings that stars\nreceive by two body relaxation. One implication of this is the presence of a\ndisk \"loss cone\" for highly eccentric stellar orbits where the dissipation from\ndisk interaction outweighs scatter via two body relaxation. The disk loss cone\nis larger than the tidal disruption loss cone for near-Eddington black hole\naccretion rates. Stellar orbits within the disk loss cone are lost from the\noverall cluster as stellar orbits are circularized and stars are potentially\nablated by their high-velocity impacts with the disk.

An\nconstrained hyperbolic divergence cleaning scheme is employed to control the\ndivergence error, and a switch for artificial resistivity with minimized\ndissipation is used. We test the codes with a large suite of MHD tests, and\nshow that in all problems the results are comparable or improved over previous\nSPMHD implementations.

The first algorithm, OTD, is a highly efficient\nOnline Top Down algorithm which provably achieves a 1/3-approximation to the MW\nrevenue under a data separation assumption. The second algorithm, OHAC, is an\nonline counterpart to offline HAC, which is known to yield a 1/3-approximation\nto the MW revenue, and produce good quality clusters in practice.

Our insight is that we can make assistive\nrobots easier for humans to control by leveraging latent actions. Latent\nactions provide a low-dimensional embedding of high-dimensional robot behavior:\nfor example, one latent dimension might guide the assistive arm along a pouring\nmotion. In this paper, we design a teleoperation algorithm for assistive robots\nthat learns latent actions from task demonstrations. We formulate the\ncontrollability, consistency, and scaling properties that user-friendly latent\nactions should have, and evaluate how different low-dimensional embeddings\ncapture these properties. Finally, we conduct two user studies on a robotic arm\nto compare our latent action approach to both state-of-the-art shared autonomy\nbaselines and a teleoperation strategy currently used by assistive arms.\nParticipants completed assistive eating and cooking tasks more efficiently when\nleveraging our latent actions, and also subjectively reported that latent\nactions made the task easier to perform.

Existing single image de-raining approaches treat rain-streak removal\nas a process of pixel-wise regression directly. However, they are lacking in\nmining the balance between over-de-raining (e.g. removing texture details in\nrain-free regions) and under-de-raining (e.g. leaving rain streaks). In this\npaper, we firstly propose a coarse-to-fine network called Gradual Network\n(GraNet) consisting of coarse stage and fine stage for delving into single\nimage de-raining with different granularities. Specifically, to reveal\ncoarse-grained rain-streak characteristics (e.g. long and thick rain\nstreaks/raindrops), we propose a coarse stage by utilizing local-global spatial\ndependencies via a local-global subnetwork composed of region-aware blocks.\nTaking the residual result (the coarse de-rained result) between the rainy\nimage sample (i.e. the input data) and the output of coarse stage (i.e. the\nlearnt rain mask) as input, the fine stage continues to de-rain by removing the\nfine-grained rain streaks (e.g. light rain streaks and water mist) to get a\nrain-free and well-reconstructed output image via a unified contextual merging\nsub-network with dense blocks and a merging block.

It delivers an estimation of the energy barrier at which ground\nand excited state curves cross, semi-classically linked to non-radiative\ntransition rate and thermal quenching. To assess its predictive power for the\nlatter properties, we propose a new \\textit{optimized configuration path (OCP)\nmethod in which} the ground-state and excited-state forces are mixed instead of\ntheir configurations. We also define another one-parameter model thanks a\ndouble energy parabola hypothesis (DEPH). We compare the OCP method and the\nDEPH reference with the 1D-CCM for three paradigmatic 4f-5d phosphors\nY$_3$Al$_5$O$_{12}$:Ce, Lu$_2$SiO$_5$:Ce, and YAlO$_3$:Ce. We find that the OCP\nand DEPH methods yield similar results with geometries that have significantly\nlower ground-state energies than the 1D-CCM for the same 4f-5d energy\ndifference. However, the OCP method suffers from the appearance of multiple\nlocal minima, rendering the clear determination of the optimal geometry very\ndifficult in practice. Still the OCP method allows one to quantify the\ndeviations from the 1D-CCM, therefore increasing confidence in the lower bound\nobtained from the DEPH for the 4f-5d crossing barrier, and its comparison with\nthe energy of the auto-ionization thermal quenching mechanism. We expect the\nOCP approach to be applicable to other luminescent materials or molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 20:46:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

As\nsuch, we first investigate the application of existing off-the-shelf\nadversarial attack approaches on malware detection systems through which we\nfound that those approaches do not necessarily maintain the functionality of\nthe original inputs.

Currently there is a trend\nin designing accelerators for special applications, while arguably a debate is\nsparked whether we should customize architecture for each application. In this\nstudy, we introduce what we refer to as Gene-Patterns, which are the base\npatterns of diverse applications. We present a Recursive Reduce methodology to\nidentify the hotspots, and a HOtspot Trace Suite (HOTS) is provided for the\nresearch community. We first extract the hotspot patterns, and then, remove the\nredundancy to obtain the base patterns. We find that although the number of\napplications is huge and ever-increasing, the amount of base patterns is\nrelatively small, due to the similarity among the patterns of diverse\napplications. The similarity stems not only from the algorithms but also from\nthe data structures. We build the Periodic Table of Memory Access Patterns\n(PT-MAP), where the indifference curves are analogous to the energy levels in\nphysics, and memory performance optimization is essentially an energy level\ntransition.

However, images generated by existing GANs\nare often of attributes (e.g., smiling expression) learned from one image\ndomain. As a result, generating images of multiple attributes requires many\nreal samples possessing multiple attributes which are very resource expensive\nto be collected. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN, namely IntersectGAN, to\nlearn multiple attributes from different image domains through an intersecting\narchitecture. For example, given two image domains $X_1$ and $X_2$ with certain\nattributes, the intersection $X_1 \\cap X_2$ denotes a new domain where images\npossess the attributes from both $X_1$ and $X_2$ domains. The proposed\nIntersectGAN consists of two discriminators $D_1$ and $D_2$ to distinguish\nbetween generated and real samples of different domains, and three generators\nwhere the intersection generator is trained against both discriminators. And an\noverall adversarial loss function is defined over three generators. As a\nresult, our proposed IntersectGAN can be trained on multiple domains of which\neach presents one specific attribute, and eventually eliminates the need of\nreal sample images simultaneously possessing multiple attributes. By using the\nCelebFaces Attributes dataset, our proposed IntersectGAN is able to produce\nhigh quality face images possessing multiple attributes (e.g., a face with\nblack hair and a smiling expression). Both qualitative and quantitative\nevaluations are conducted to compare our proposed IntersectGAN with other\nbaseline methods. Besides, several different applications of IntersectGAN have\nbeen explored with promising results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Sep 2019 03:40:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 10:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-04"}

However, the dark\ngap solitons are still experimentally unproven, and their properties in more\nthan one dimension remain unknown. In light of this, we describe, numerically\nand theoretically, the formation and stability properties of gap-type dark\nlocalized modes in the context of ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices.\nTwo kinds of stable dark localized modes--gap solitons and soliton\nclusters--are predicted in both the one- and two-dimensional geometries.

However, all existing data repairing rules are\nprovided by experts which is an expensive task in time and effort.

A possible way forward\nto isolate the 21cm Epoch of Reionization (EoR) signal from the much larger\nforeground component is to focus on the remaining portion of the Fourier space\ncalled as the EoR window. There are in-fact three distinct regions in the\nFourier space, (i) the Foreground wedge portion, (ii) the EoR window region\nwhich lies beyond Horizon wedge and (iii) the region in between the Horizon\nwedge and the Field of View wedge. This paper addresses two questions: (1)\nWhether the signal in between the two wedges is also a direct representation of\nthe EoR brightness temperature fluctuations? and (2) How can we extract the\ncosmology information from this region considering that the foregrounds are\nmuch larger than the signal?

In continuous irradiation, C15 clusters are frequently formed, after\nwhich they remain highly stable and grow by absorbing nearby single\ninterstitial atoms.

As a result,\nthe previous methods cannot guarantee that the generated visual features can\ntruthfully reflect the corresponding semantics. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel method named Cycle-consistent Adversarial Networks for\nZero-Shot Learning (CANZSL). It encourages a visual feature generator to\nsynthesize realistic visual features from semantics, and then inversely\ntranslate back synthesized the visual feature to corresponding semantic space\nby a semantic feature generator. Furthermore, in this paper a more challenging\nand practical ZSL problem is considered where the original semantics are from\nnatural language with irrelevant words instead of clean semantics that are\nwidely used in previous work. Specifically, a multi-modal consistent\nbidirectional generative adversarial network is trained to handle unseen\ninstances by leveraging noise in the natural language. A forward one-to-many\nmapping from one text description to multiple visual features is coupled with\nan inverse many-to-one mapping from the visual space to the semantic space.\nThus, a multi-modal cycle-consistency loss between the synthesized semantic\nrepresentations and the ground truth can be learned and leveraged to enforce\nthe generated semantic features to approximate to the real distribution in\nsemantic space.

In particular, while in\nprevious treatments the linearization of this homogeneous integral equation\nintroduced an indeterminacy in the scale of the corresponding mass, the current\napproach determines it uniquely, once the value of the gauge coupling at a\ngiven renormalization point is used as input. A crucial ingredient for this\nconstruction is the \"kinetic term\" of the gluon propagator, whose form is not\nobtained from the complicated equation governing its evolution, but is rather\napproximated by suitable initial {\\it Ans\\\"atze}, which are subsequently\nimproved by means of a systematic iterative procedure. The multiplicative\nrenormalization of the central equation is carried out following an approximate\nmethod, which is extensively employed in the studies of the standard quark gap\nequation.

The learner's\ngoal is to design a querying strategy with the minimum number of queries\n(optimal query complexity) so that she can accurately estimate the true value,\nwhile the eavesdropping adversary even with the complete knowledge of her\nquerying strategy cannot.\n  We develop new querying strategies and analytical techniques and use them to\nprove tight upper and lower bounds on the optimal query complexity. The bounds\nalmost match across the entire parameter range, substantially improving upon\nexisting results. We thus obtain a complete picture of the optimal query\ncomplexity as a function of the estimation accuracy and the desired levels of\nprivacy. We also extend the results to sequential learning models in higher\ndimensions, and where the binary responses are noisy. Our analysis leverages a\ncrucial insight into the nature of private learning problem, which suggests\nthat the query trajectory of an optimal learner can be divided into distinct\nphases that focus on pure learning versus learning and obfuscation,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Sep 2019 14:39:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 00:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

To this end, this paper\nsolves CAM generation by using multiple classification models. To form multiple\nclassification networks that carry different discriminative information, we try\nto capture the semantic relationships between classes to form different\nsemantic levels of classification models. Specifically, hierarchical clustering\nbased on class relationships is used to form hierarchical clustering results,\nwhere the clustering levels are treated as semantic levels to form the\nclassification models.

Traditional security\nsolutions rely on a centralized authority, which can be a performance\nbottleneck or susceptible to a single point of failure. Inspired by\ncontainerized microservices and blockchain technology, this paper proposed a\nBLockchain-ENabled Secure Microservices for Decentralized Data Marketplaces\n(BlendSM-DDM). Within a permissioned blockchain network, a microservices based\nsecurity mechanism is introduced to secure data exchange and payment among\nparticipants in the marketplace. BlendSM-DDM is able to offer a decentralized,\nscalable and auditable data exchanges for the data marketplace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Sep 2019 15:24:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

The two\nsub-problems are coupled to each other through a non-dimensional parameter\ncalled 'farm wind-speed reduction factor' or 'farm induction factor,' for which\na simple analytic equation is derived that can be solved iteratively using\ninformation obtained from both sub-problems.
