It states that certain quantum mechanical\ntheories can actually be described by classical gravity in one higher\ndimension, in a spacetime called anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. What makes this\nduality so useful is that it relates theories with weak coupling to theories\nwith strong coupling and thus provides a new tool for tackling strongly coupled\nquantum field theories, which are notoriously difficult to handle using\nconventional methods. During the course of my PhD I have mostly studied time\ndependent processes, in particular thermalization processes, in quantum field\ntheories using the AdS/CFT correspondence. On the gravity side, this is dual to\ndynamical formation of black holes from the collapse of matter fields. By\nstudying the gravitational collapse process in detail, we can then draw\nconclusions about the dynamical formation of a thermal state in the dual\nquantum field theory. Using mostly numerical methods, I have studied how\nconfinement affects thermalization in quantum field theories, where the system\nmay never thermalize and field theory observables undergo interesting\nquasiperiodic behaviour. I have also studied formation of black holes in three\ndimensions which due to the simplified nature of three-dimensional gravity can\nbe done using analytical methods. This has led to the discovery of new\nsolutions of three-dimensional gravity corresponding to the formation of black\nholes without spherical symmetry, which can provide a deeper understanding of\nthermalization in two-dimensional quantum field theories. In a third line of\nresearch, I have studied higher spin gravity in three dimensions, an exotic\nextension of three-dimensional gravity which includes fields with spin higher\nthan two, and we outline a new method to construct black hole solutions\ncarrying higher spin charge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2019 17:27:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

We provide a formal definition of local forward\nmodels for which we propose two basic learning approaches. Our analysis is\nbased on the game Sokoban, where a wrong action can lead to an unsolvable game\nstate. Therefore, an accurate prediction of an action's resulting state is\nnecessary to avoid this scenario.\n  In contrast to learning the complete state transition function, local forward\nmodels allow extracting multiple training examples from a single state\ntransition. In this way, the Hash Set model, as well as the Decision Tree\nmodel, quickly learn to predict upcoming state transitions of both the training\nand the test set. Applying the model using a statistical forward planner showed\nthat the best models can be used to satisfying degree even in cases in which\nthe test levels have not yet been seen.\n  Our evaluation includes an analysis of various local neighbourhood patterns\nand sizes to test the learners' capabilities in case too few or too many\nattributes are extracted, of which the latter has shown do degrade the\nperformance of the model learner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2019 18:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

To support the computation offloading, we propose a hybrid\nrelaying (HR) approach employing two orthogonal frequency bands, where the\namplify-and-forward scheme is used in one band to exchange computational\nresults, while the decode-and-forward scheme is used in the other band to\ntransfer the unprocessed tasks. The motivation behind the proposed HR scheme\nfor RACO is to adapt the allocation of computing and communication resources\nboth to dynamic user requirements and to diverse computational tasks. Within\nthis framework, we seek to minimize the weighted sum of the execution delay and\nthe energy consumption in the RACO system by jointly optimizing the computation\noffloading ratio, the bandwidth allocation, the processor speeds, as well as\nthe transmit power levels of both user $A$ and the MERS, under practical\nconstraints on the available computing and communication resources. The\nresultant problem is formulated as a non-differentiable and nonconvex\noptimization program with highly coupled constraints. By adopting a series of\ntransformations and introducing auxiliary variables, we first convert this\nproblem into a more tractable yet equivalent form. We then develop an efficient\niterative algorithm for its solution based on the concave-convex procedure. By\nexploiting the special structure of this problem, we also propose a simplified\nalgorithm based on the inexact block coordinate descent method, with reduced\ncomputational complexity. Finally, we present numerical results that illustrate\nthe advantages of the proposed algorithms over state-of-the-art benchmark\nschemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2019 21:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Standard cold and thermic warm DM particles have a smooth transition from\nbeing relativistic at high energies to a non-relativistic regime since the mass\nof these particles is constant while the velocity redshifts with the expansion\nof the universe. However, here we explore the possibility that the DM particle\nacquires a non-perturbative mass at a phase transition scale and a scale factor\nac. This transition acquired a more fundamental meaning for the Bound Dark\nMatter (BDM) model because they describe a particle getting its mass through a\nnon-perturbative process.

COMA addresses\nthree challenges related to the obfuscated circuits: First, it removes the need\nfor the storage of the obfuscation unlock key at the untrusted chip. Second, it\nimplements a mechanism by which the key sent for unlocking an obfuscated\ncircuit changes after each activation (even for the same device), transforming\nthe key into a dynamically changing license. Third, it protects the\ncommunication to/from the COMA protected device and additionally introduces two\nnovel mechanisms for the exchange of data to/from COMA protected architectures:\n(1) a highly secure but slow double encryption, which is used for exchange of\nkey and sensitive data (2) a high-performance and low-energy yet leaky\nencryption, secured by means of frequent key renewal. We demonstrate that\ncompared to state-of-the-art key management architectures, COMA reduces the\narea overhead by 14%, while allowing additional features including unique chip\nauthentication, enabling activation as a service (for IoT devices), reducing\nthe side channel threats on key management architecture, and providing two new\nmeans of secure communication to/from an untrusted chip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2019 23:51:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

During the inspiral\nphase, the spinning BH could be charged to the Wald charge quantity $Q_{\\rm W}$\nuntil merger in an electro-vacuum approximation.

As the force-free magnetosphere is full of a highly conducting plasma,\nthe magnetic flux over the NS's caps would be retained outside the BH's event\nhorizon under the frozen-in condition.

KG\ncompletion exploits the existing facts in a KG to discover new ones.\nTranslation-based embedding model (TransE) is a prominent formulation to do KG\ncompletion. Despite the efficiency of TransE in memory and time, it suffers\nfrom several limitations in encoding relation patterns such as symmetric,\nreflexive etc. To resolve this problem, most of the attempts have circled\naround the revision of the score function of TransE i.e., proposing a more\ncomplicated score function such as Trans(A, D, G, H, R, etc) to mitigate the\nlimitations. In this paper, we tackle this problem from a different\nperspective. We show that existing theories corresponding to the limitations of\nTransE are inaccurate because they ignore the effect of loss function.\nAccordingly, we pose theoretical investigations of the main limitations of\nTransE in the light of loss function. To the best of our knowledge, this has\nnot been investigated so far comprehensively. We show that by a proper\nselection of the loss function for training the TransE model, the main\nlimitations of the model are mitigated. This is explained by setting\nupper-bound for the scores of positive samples, showing the region of truth\n(i.e., the region that a triple is considered positive by the model). Our\ntheoretical proofs with experimental results fill the gap between the\ncapability of translation-based class of embedding models and the loss\nfunction.

The objective is to measure how quickly a fire (e.g., a piece of fake\nnews) can be spread in a network. The burning process takes place in discrete\nrounds. In each round, a new fire breaks out at a selected vertex and burns it.\nMeanwhile, the old fires extend to their neighbours and burn them. A burning\nschedule selects where the new fire breaks out in each round, and the burning\nproblem asks for a schedule that burns all vertices in a minimum number of\nrounds, termed the burning number of the graph. The burning problem is known to\nbe NP-hard even when the graph is a tree or a disjoint set of paths. For\nconnected graphs, it has been conjectured that burning takes at most $\\lceil\n\\sqrt{n} \\rceil$ rounds.\n  We approach the algorithmic study of graph burning from two directions.\nFirst, we consider graphs with minimum degree $\\delta$. We present an algorithm\nthat burns any graph of size $n$ in at most $\\sqrt{\\frac{24n}{\\delta+1}}$\nrounds. In particular, for dense graphs with $\\delta \\in \\Theta(n)$, all\nvertices are burned in a constant number of rounds. More interestingly, even\nwhen $\\delta$ is a constant that is independent of the graph size, our\nalgorithm answers the graph-burning conjecture in the affirmative by burning\nthe graph in at most $\\lceil \\sqrt{n} \\rceil$ rounds. Next, we consider burning\ngraphs with bounded path-length or tree-length. These include many graph\nfamilies including connected interval graphs and connected chordal graphs. We\nshow that any graph with path-length $pl$ and diameter $d$ can be burned in\n$\\lceil \\sqrt{d-1} \\rceil + pl$ rounds.

In this article we propose a novel efficient Monte Carlo\nestimator of EVSI by applying a multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method. Instead\nof fixing the number of inner samples for $\\theta$ as done in the nested Monte\nCarlo estimator, we consider a geometric progression on the number of inner\nsamples, which yields a hierarchy of estimators on the inner conditional\nexpectation with increasing approximation levels. Based on an elementary\ntelescoping sum, our MLMC estimator is given by a sum of the Monte Carlo\nestimates of the differences between successive approximation levels on the\ninner conditional expectation. We show, under a set of assumptions on decision\nand information models, that successive approximation levels are tightly\ncoupled, which directly proves that our MLMC estimator improves the necessary\ncomputational cost to optimal $O(\\varepsilon^{-2})$.

Unfortunately, compression techniques either incur tag area overheads\nor restrict data placement to only include neighboring compressed cache blocks\nto mitigate tag area overheads. Ideally, we should be able to place arbitrary\ncompressed cache blocks without any placement restrictions and tag area\noverheads.\n  This paper proposes Touch\\'e, a framework that enables storing multiple\narbitrary compressed cache blocks within a physical cacheline without any tag\narea overheads. The Touch\\'e framework consists of three components. The first\ncomponent, called the ``Signature'' (SIGN) engine, creates shortened signatures\nfrom the tag addresses of compressed blocks. Due to this, the SIGN engine can\nstore multiple signatures in each tag entry. On a cache access, the physical\ncacheline is accessed only if there is a signature match (which has a\nnegligible probability of false positive). The second component, called the\n``Tag Appended Data'' (TADA) mechanism, stores the full tag addresses with\ndata. TADA enables Touch\\'e to detect false positive signature matches by\nensuring that the actual tag address is available for comparison. The third\ncomponent, called the ``Superblock Marker'' (SMARK) mechanism, uses a unique\nmarker in the tag entry to indicate the occurrence of compressed cache blocks\nfrom neighboring physical addresses in the same cacheline. Touch\\'e is\ncompletely hardware-based and achieves an average speedup of 12\\% (ideal 13\\%)\nwhen compared to an uncompressed baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2019 05:39:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

However, their computational complexity makes it necessary to\ndesign efficient hardware accelerators. Most CNN accelerators focus on\nexploring dataflow styles that exploit computational parallelism. However,\npotential performance speedup from sparsity has not been adequately addressed.\nThe computation and memory footprint of CNNs can be significantly reduced if\nsparsity is exploited in network evaluations. To take advantage of sparsity,\nsome accelerator designs explore sparsity encoding and evaluation on CNN\naccelerators. However, sparsity encoding is just performed on activation or\nweight and only in inference. It has been shown that activation and weight also\nhave high sparsity levels during training. Hence, sparsity-aware computation\nshould also be considered in training. To further improve performance and\nenergy efficiency, some accelerators evaluate CNNs with limited precision.\nHowever, this is limited to the inference since reduced precision sacrifices\nnetwork accuracy if used in training. In addition, CNN evaluation is usually\nmemory-intensive, especially in training. In this paper, we propose SPRING, a\nSParsity-aware Reduced-precision Monolithic 3D CNN accelerator for trainING and\ninference. SPRING supports both CNN training and inference. It uses a binary\nmask scheme to encode sparsities in activation and weight. It uses the\nstochastic rounding algorithm to train CNNs with reduced precision without\naccuracy loss. To alleviate the memory bottleneck in CNN evaluation, especially\nin training, SPRING uses an efficient monolithic 3D NVM interface to increase\nmemory bandwidth.

In this paper, we divide Edge Intelligence into AI\nfor edge (Intelligence-enabled Edge Computing) and AI on edge (Artificial\nIntelligence on Edge). The former focuses on providing more optimal solutions\nto key problems in Edge Computing with the help of popular and effective AI\ntechnologies while the latter studies how to carry out the entire process of\nbuilding AI models, i.e., model training and inference, on the edge. This paper\nprovides insights into this new inter-disciplinary field from a broader\nperspective. It discusses the core concepts and the research road-map, which\nshould provide the necessary background for potential future research\ninitiatives in Edge Intelligence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2019 06:37:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 11:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

We focus on the role of the\nconstituent Majorana fermions and the subgap Andreev states. The double\ndegeneracy of Majorana fermions of the individual legs of the ladder gets\nlifted by a coupling between the two leading to the formation of Andreev bound\nstates. The coupling can be induced by a superconducting phase difference\nbetween the two legs of the ladder accompanied by a finite inter-leg hopping.\nAndreev bound states formed strongly enhance local Andreev reflection. When the\nladder and normal metal are weakly coupled, the Andreev bound states, which are\nthe controlling factor, result in weak nonlocal scattering. In sharp contrast,\nwhen the ladder - normal metal interface is transparent to electron flow, we\nfind that the subgap Andreev states enhance nonlocal conductance strongly. The\nfeatures in the local and nonlocal conductances resemble the spectrum of the\nisolated ladder. Long-range pairing helps lift the degeneracy of the Majorana\nmodes, makes them less localized, and thus inhibits local transport, while\naiding non-local transport. In particular, long-range pairing alone (without a\nsuperconducting phase difference) can enhance crossed Andreev reflection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2019 06:56:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 10:12:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-05"}

A long-standing\nopen problem, which is a key for fundamental understanding the mysterious QSL\nstates, is how the quantum fluctuations respond to randomness due to quenched\ndisorder. Transition metal dichalcogenide 1T-TaS$_2$ is a candidate material\nthat hosts a QSL ground state with spin-1/2 on the two-dimensional perfect\ntriangular lattice. Here, we performed systematic studies of low-temperature\nheat capacity and thermal conductivity on pure, Se-substituted and electron\nirradiated crystals of 1T-TaS$_2$. In pure 1T-TaS$_2$, the linear temperature\nterm of the heat capacity $\\gamma T$ and the finite residual linear term of the\nthermal conductivity in the zero-temperature limit\n$\\kappa_{0}/T\\equiv\\kappa/T(T\\rightarrow0)$ are clearly resolved, consistent\nwith the presence of gapless spinons with a Fermi surface. Moreover, while the\nstrong magnetic field slightly enhances $\\kappa_0/T$, it strongly suppresses\n$\\gamma$. These unusual contrasting responses to magnetic field imply the\ncoexistence of two types of gapless excitations with itinerant and localized\ncharacters. Introduction of additional weak random exchange disorder in\n1T-Ta(S$_{1-x}$Se$_x$)$_2$ leads to vanishing of $\\kappa_0/T$, indicating that\nthe itinerant gapless excitations are sensitive to the disorder. On the other\nhand, in both pure and Se-substituted systems, the magnetic contribution of the\nheat capacity obeys a universal scaling relation, which is consistent with a\ntheory that assumes the presence of localized orphan spins forming random\nsinglets.

One of the frequently observed features at\nrange margins is fragmentation, caused internally by population dynamics or\nexternally by the limited availability of suitable habitat sites. We study both\ncauses, and describe the transition from a connected to a fragmented state\nacross space by means of a gradient metapopulation model. The main features of\nour approach are the following. 1) Inhomogeneities can occur at two spatial\nscales: there is a broad-scale gradient, which can be patterned by fine-scale\nheterogeneities. The latter is implemented by dispersing a variable number of\nsmall obstacles over the terrain, which can be penetrable or unpenetrable by\nthe spreading species. 2) We study the occupancy of this terrain in a\nsteady-state on two temporal scales: in snapshots and by long-term averages.\nThe simulations reveal some general scaling laws that are applicable in various\nenvironments, independently of the mechanism of fragmentation. The edge of the\nconnected region (the hull) is a fractal with dimension 7/4. Its width and\nlength changes with the gradient according to universal scaling laws, that are\ncharacteristic for percolation transitions. The results suggest that\npercolation theory is a powerful tool for understanding the structure of range\nmargins in a broad variety of real-life scenarios, including those in which the\nenvironmental gradient is combined with fine-scale heterogeneity. This provides\na new method for comparing the range margins of different species in various\ngeographic regions, and monitoring range shifts under climate change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2019 07:52:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 08:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-28"}

To address the issue, domain\nadaptation transfers knowledge from the label-sufficient domain (source domain)\nto the label-scarce domain (target domain). Self-training is one of the\npowerful ways to achieve domain adaptation since it helps class-wise domain\nadaptation. Unfortunately, a naive approach that utilizes pseudo-labels as\nground-truth degenerates the performance due to incorrect pseudo-labels. In\nthis paper, we introduce a weak self-training (WST) method and adversarial\nbackground score regularization (BSR) for domain adaptive one-stage object\ndetection. WST diminishes the adverse effects of inaccurate pseudo-labels to\nstabilize the learning procedure. BSR helps the network extract discriminative\nfeatures for target backgrounds to reduce the domain shift. Two components are\ncomplementary to each other as BSR enhances discrimination between foregrounds\nand backgrounds, whereas WST strengthen class-wise discrimination.

To correctly interpret the spectra of the\nafterglow we need to have a good understanding of the foreground interstellar\nmedium (ISM) in our own Galaxy. The common practice to correct for the\nforeground is to use neutral hydrogen (HI) data from the Leiden/Argentina/Bonn\n(LAB) survey. However, the poor spatial resolution of the single dish data may\nhave a significant effect on the derived column densities. To investigate this,\nwe present new high-resolution HI observations with the Australia Telescope\nCompact Array (ATCA) towards 4 GRBs.

The $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave\ninstability is robust to increasing $U$ near half-filling as expected. Away\nfrom half filling, the predictions of KL and RPA at small $U$ for transitions\nto other pair states agree with DCA at intermediate $U$ as well as recent\ndiagrammatic Monte Carlo calculations. RPA results fail only in the very dilute\nlimit, where it yields a $d_{xy}$ ground state instead of a $p$-wave state\nestablished by diagrammatic Monte Carlo and low-order perturbative methods, as\nwell as our DCA calculations.

This\nprocess is regarded as a signature of the dynamics of transient supramolecular\nstructures formed by H-bonding. In phenyl propanols the steric hindrance of the\nphenyl ring is assumed to influence chain formation and thereby to decrease or\neven suppress the intensity of the Debye process. In the present paper we study\nthis effect in a systematic series of structural isomers of phenyl-1-propanol\nin comparison with 1-propanol. It turns out that by combining BDS, Photon\nCorrelation Spectroscopy (PCS) and calorimetry the dynamics of supramolecular\nstructures can be uncovered. While light scattering spectra show the same\nspectral shape of the main relaxation for all investigated monoalcohols, the\ndielectric spectra differ in the Debye contribution. Thus it becomes possible\nfor the first time to unambiguously disentangle both relaxation modes in the\ndielectric spectra. It turns out that the Debye relaxation gets weaker the\ncloser the position of phenyl ring is to the hydroxy group, in accordance with\nthe analysis of the Kirkwood-Fr\\\"ohlich correlation factor. Even in\n1-phenyl-1-propanol, which has the phenyl group attached at the closest\nposition to the hydroxy group, we can separate a Debye-contribution in the\ndielectric spectrum. From this we conclude that hydrogen bonds are not\ngenerally suppressed by the increased steric hindrance of the phenyl ring, but\nrather an equilibrium of ring and chain-like structures is shifted towards\nring-like shapes on shifting the phenyl ring closer to the hydroxy group.\nMoreover, the shape of the alpha-relaxation as monitored by PCS and BDS remains\nunaffected by the degree of hydrogen bonding and is the same among the\ninvestigated alcohols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2019 10:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

We use ALMA to image the\nemission of a set of molecular gas tracers in the circumnuclear disk (CND) and\nthe torus of the galaxy using the CO(2-1), CO(3-2) and HCO+(4-3) lines with\nspatial resolutions ~0.03\"-0.09\"(2-6pc). ALMA resolves the CND as an asymmetric\nringed disk of D~400pc-size and mass of ~1.4x10^8 Msun. The inner edge of the\nring is associated with edge-brightened arcs of NIR polarized emission\nidentified with the working surface of the AGN ionized wind. ALMA proves the\nexistence of a molecular torus of M_torus ~ 3x10^5Msun, which extends over a\nlarge range of spatial scales D=10-30pc around the central engine.

The torus is connected to the CND through a network of gas\nstreamers. The kinematics of molecular gas show strong departures from circular\nmotions in the torus, the gas streamers, and the CND.

In contrast, the peak\nmaxima of the negative imaginary part of the inverse dielectric function are\nattributed to the so-called longitudinal optical (LO) oscillator frequencies.\nThe shapes of the corresponding bands resemble those of the imaginary part of\nthe dielectric function. Therefore, it seems natural to also employ sums of the\ncontributions of damped harmonic oscillators to describe the imaginary part of\nthe inverse dielectric function. In this contribution, we derive the\ncorresponding dispersion relations to investigate and establish the\nrelationship between the transversal and longitudinal optical oscillator\nstrength, which can differ, according to experimental results, by up to three\norders of magnitude. So far, these differences are not understood and prevent\nthe longitudinal optical oscillator strengths from proper interpretation.

The\ninterference of such plasmon wave and the incoming pulse leads to a periodic\nmodulation of the deposited laser energy on the surface of the sample.

Our method\nlearns sensor or algorithm properties jointly with semantic depth fusion and\nscene completion and can also be used as an expert system, e.g. to unify the\nstrengths of various photometric stereo algorithms. Our approach is the first\nto unify all these properties. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic and\nreal data sets demonstrate clear improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2019 13:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

Silent data corruptions (SDCs) are\ntypically caused by such soft errors in the form of bit-flips in the memory\nsubsystem and hinder the correctness of scientific applications. This work\naddresses the problem of protecting a class of iterative computational kernels,\ncalled stencils, against SDCs when executing on parallel HPC systems. Existing\nSDC detection and correction methods are in general either inaccurate,\ninefficient, or targeting specific application classes that do not include\nstencils. This work proposes a novel algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT)\nmethod to protect scientific applications that contain arbitrary stencil\ncomputations against SDCs. The ABFT method can be applied both online and\noffline to accurately detect and correct SDCs in 2D and 3D parallel stencil\ncomputations.

To avoid any deleterious\ninfluence of polymer residues from pre-ALD graphene transfers we employ a\nsubstrate-assisted ALD process directly on the as grown graphene still\nremaining on its Cu growth catalyst support.

This self-induced stabilization\nis accompanied by transitioning of the ring to a non-Brownian particle and a\ncessation of tumbling. The ring swells significantly in the vorticity\ndirection, and the horseshoe regions on the stretched and swollen ring are\neffectively locked in place relative to the ring's center-of-mass.

While isolated BDs are most likely produced\nby gravitational collapse in molecular clouds down to masses of a few Mjup, a\nnon-negligible fraction of low-mass companions might be formed through the\nplanet formation channel in protoplanetary disks. The upper mass limit of\nobjects formed within disks is still observationally unknown, the main reason\nbeing the strong dearth of BD companions at orbital periods shorter than 10\nyears, a.k.a. the BD desert. To address this question, we aim at determining\nthe best statistics of secondary companions within the 10-100Mjup range and\nwithin 10 au from the primary star, while minimising observational bias. We\nmade an extensive use of the RV surveys of FGK stars below 60pc distance to the\nSun and in the northern hemisphere performed with the SOPHIE spectrograph at\nthe Observatoire de Haute-Provence. We derived the Keplerian solutions of the\nRV variations of 54 sources. Public astrometric data of the Hipparcos and Gaia\nmissions allowed constraining the mass of the companion for most sources. We\nintroduce GASTON, a new method to derive inclination combining RVs Keplerian\nand astrometric excess noise from Gaia DR1. We report the discovery of 12 new\nBD candidates. For 5 of them, additional astrometric data led to revise their\nmass in the M-dwarf regime. Among the 7 remaining objects, 4 are confirmed BD\ncompanions, and 3 others are likely in this mass regime. We also report the\ndetection of 42 M-dwarfs within 90Mjup-0.52Msun. The resulting Msin(i)-P\ndistribution of BD candidates shows a clear drop in the detection rate below\n80-day orbital period. Above that limit, the BD desert reveals rather wet, with\na uniform distribution of the Msin(i).

As a consequence of this equivariant normal form theorem, the\nabstract moduli space obtained by factorizing a level set of the equivariant\nmap with respect to the group action carries the structure of a Kuranishi\nspace.\n  Moreover, the theory of singular symplectic reduction is developed in the\ninfinite-dimensional Fr\\'echet setting.

The fibered structure of the cotangent bundle yields a\nrefinement of the usual orbit-momentum type strata into so-called seams.

This problem\narises naturally in a number of contexts, such as business, where we may want\nto rank potential projects by profitability; or science, where we may want to\nrank predictors potentially associated with some trait by the strength of the\nassociation. This approach provides a valuable alternative to the sparsity\nframework often used with big data. Most approaches to this problem are\nempirical Bayesian, where we use the data to estimate the hyperparameters of\nthe prior distribution, then use that distribution to estimate the unobserved\nparameter values. There are a number of different approaches to this problem,\nbased on different loss functions for mis-ranking units. Despite the number of\npapers developing methods for this problem, there is no work on the consistency\nof these methods. In this paper, we develop a general framework for consistency\nof empirical Bayesian ranking methods, which includes nearly all commonly used\nmethods.

Our study uses the Highly Improved Staggered\nQuark (HISQ) action on gluon field configurations that include $n_f=2+1+1$\nflavours of sea quarks, but our results have applicability to other quark\nactions. Renormalisation schemes that make use of the exact lattice vector\nWard-Takahashi identity for the conserved current also have renormalisation\nfactors, $Z_V$, for nonconserved vector currents that are free of contamination\nby nonperturbative condensates. We show this by explicit comparison of two such\nschemes: that of the vector form factor at zero momentum transfer and the\nRI-SMOM momentum-subtraction scheme. The two determinations of $Z_V$ differ\nonly by discretisation effects (for any value of momentum-transfer in the\nRI-SMOM case). The RI$^{\\prime}$-MOM scheme, although widely used, does not\nshare this property.

This radiation emission, known as the Cherenkov\neffect, is among the most fundamental processes in electrodynamics. As such, it\nis used in numerous applications of particle detectors, particle accelerators,\nlight sources, and medical imaging. Surprisingly, all Cherenkov-based\napplications and experiments thus far were fully described by classical\nelectrodynamics even though theoretical work predicts new Cherenkov phenomena\ncoming from quantum electrodynamics. The quantum description could provide new\npossibilities for the design of highly controllable light sources and more\nefficient accelerators and detectors. Here, we provide a direct evidence of the\nquantum nature of the Cherenkov effect and reveal its intrinsic quantum\nfeatures. By satisfying the Cherenkov condition for relativistic electron\nwavefunctions and maintaining it over hundreds of microns, each electron\nsimultaneously accelerates and decelerates by absorbing and emitting hundreds\nof photons in a coherent manner. We observe this strong interaction in an\nultrafast transmission electron microscope, achieving for the first time a\nphase-matching between a relativistic electron wavefunction and a propagating\nlight wave. Consequently, the quantum wavefunction of each electron evolves\ninto a coherent plateau, analogous to a frequency comb in ultrashort laser\npulses, containing hundreds of quantized energy peaks. Our findings prove that\nthe delocalized wave nature of electrons can become dominant in stimulated\ninteractions. In addition to prospects for known applications of the Cherenkov\neffect, our work provides a platform for utilizing quantum electrodynamics for\napplications in electron microscopy and in free-electron pump-probe\nspectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2019 15:04:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 17:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

The growth and\nmigration of a large number of individual protoplanetary embryos are simulated\nin a population synthesis manner. We test two hypotheses for the birth\nlocations of embryos: at the water ice line or log-uniformly distributed over\nentire protoplanetary disks. Two types of disks with different turbulent\nviscous parameters alpha of 1e-3 and 1e-4 are investigated, to shed light on\nthe role of outward migration of protoplanets. The forming planets are compared\nwith the observed exoplanets in terms of masses, semimajor axes, metallicities,\nand water contents. We find that gas giant planets are likely to form when the\ncharacteristic disk sizes are larger, the disk accretion rates are higher, the\ndisks are more metal-rich and/or their stellar hosts are more massive. Our\nmodel shows that 1) the characteristic mass of super-Earth is set by the pebble\nisolation mass. Super-Earth masses increase linearly with the mass of its\nstellar host, corresponding to one Earth mass around a late M-dwarf star and 20\nEarth masses around a solar-mass star. 2) The low-mass planets up to 20 Earth\nmasses can form around stars with a wide range of metallicities, while massive\ngas giant planets are preferred to grow around metal-rich stars. 3) Super-Earth\nplanets that are mainly composed of silicates, with relatively low water\nfractions can form from protoplanetary embryos at the water ice line in weakly\nturbulent disks where outward migration is suppressed. However, if the embryos\nare formed over a wide range of radial distances, the super-Earths would end up\nhaving a distinctive, bimodal composition in water mass.

Here,\nwe have carried out molecular dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained model\nwith a force-field obtained from the statistical associating fluid theory to\nstudy droplets laden with common and superspreading surfactants.

Its key challenge lies in how to integrate diverse\nfactors (such as temporal rules and spatial dependencies) to infer the\nevolution trend of traffic flow. To address this problem, we propose a unified\nneural network called Attentive Traffic Flow Machine (ATFM), which can\neffectively learn the spatial-temporal feature representations of traffic flow\nwith an attention mechanism. In particular, our ATFM is composed of two\nprogressive Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM\n\\cite{xingjian2015convolutional}) units connected with a convolutional layer.\nSpecifically, the first ConvLSTM unit takes normal traffic flow features as\ninput and generates a hidden state at each time-step, which is further fed into\nthe connected convolutional layer for spatial attention map inference. The\nsecond ConvLSTM unit aims at learning the dynamic spatial-temporal\nrepresentations from the attentionally weighted traffic flow features. Further,\nwe develop two deep learning frameworks based on ATFM to predict citywide\nshort-term/long-term traffic flow by adaptively incorporating the sequential\nand periodic data as well as other external influences. Extensive experiments\non two standard benchmarks well demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\nmethod for traffic flow prediction. Moreover, to verify the generalization of\nour method, we also apply the customized framework to forecast the passenger\npickup/dropoff demands in traffic prediction and show its superior performance.\nOur code and data are available at\n{\\color{blue}\\url{https://github.com/liulingbo918/ATFM}}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2019 01:41:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 17:10:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 13:08:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2020 01:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

While the application of Blockchain technologies is being spread\nbeyond cryptocurrency, cloud computing is also seeing a paradigm shift to meet\nthe needs of the 4th industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). New technological\nad-vancement, especially by the fusion of these two, such as\nBlockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS), is considered to be able to significantly\ngenerate values to the en-terprises. This article surveys the current status of\nBaaS in terms of technological development, applications, market potentials and\nso forth. An evaluative judge-ment, comparing amongst various BaaS platforms,\nhas been presented, along with the trajectory of adoption, challenges and risk\nfactors. Finally, the study suggests standardisation of available BaaS\nplatforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2019 03:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

In this\npaper, we propose a smart alternative of data obfuscation in the form of\nImpulsive Statistical Fingerprinting (ISF). We provide important insights into\nour research in healthcare SCADA data security and the use of ISF.

However, conventional systems can hardly\nbe deployed in real-world settings since they typically require objects to\neither deliberately cooperate or carry a wireless active device or\nidentification tag. To accomplish the complicated successive tasks using a\nsingle device in real time, we propose a smart metasurface imager and\nrecognizer simultaneously, empowered by a network of artificial neural networks\n(ANNs) for adaptively controlling data flow. Here, three ANNs are employed in\nan integrated hierarchy: transforming measured microwave data into images of\nwhole human body; classifying the specifically designated spots (hand and\nchest) within the whole image; and recognizing human hand signs instantly at\nWi-Fi frequency of 2.4 GHz. Instantaneous in-situ imaging of full scene and\nadaptive recognition of hand signs and vital signs of multiple non-cooperative\npeople have been experimentally demonstrated. We also show that the proposed\nintelligent metasurface system work well even when it is passively excited by\nstray Wi-Fi signals that ubiquitously exist in our daily lives. The reported\nstrategy could open a new avenue for future smart cities, smart homes,\nhuman-device interactive interfaces, healthy monitoring, and safety screening\nfree of visual privacy issues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 2019 06:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}
