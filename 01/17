In contrast to the ground state of\nlocal fermions, exhibiting an entanglement entropy area law with logarithmic\ncorrections, the entropy of nonlocal fermions is extensive, scaling as the\nvolume of the subregion and crossing over to the anomalous fermion area law at\nscales larger than the locality scale, {\\alpha}. In the 1-d case, we are able\nto show that the central charge appearing in the universal entropy expressions\nfor large subregions is simply related to the locality scale. These results are\ndemonstrated by exact diagonalizations of the corresponding discrete lattice\nfermion models. Within the Ryu-Takayanagi holographic picture, the relation\nbetween the central charge and the locality scale suggest a dual spacetime in\nwhich the size of the flat UV portion and the radius of AdS in the IR are both\nproportional to the locality scale, {\\alpha}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 16:02:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

In this paper we study and quantify the\nimplications of the presence of the above term in the context of vacuum $f(R)$.\nParticularly, we assume that axionic dark matter is present during inflation,\nand we examine in a quantitative way the effects of axionic Chern-Simons terms\non the tensor perturbations. The axion field is quantified in terms of a\ncanonical scalar field, with broken Peccei-Quinn symmetry. The model perfectly\ndescribing axions as potential dark matter candidates is based on the so-called\nmisalignment mechanism, in which case the axion is frozen near its non-zero\nvacuum expectation value during early times in which $H\\gg m_a$. In effect, the\ninflationary era is mainly controlled by the $f(R)$ gravity and the\nChern-Simons term. As we demonstrate, the Chern-Simons term may achieve to make\na non-viable $f(R)$ gravity theory to be phenomenologically viable, due to the\nfact that the tensor-to-scalar ratio is significantly reduced, and the same\napplies to the spectral index of the tensor perturbations $n_T$. Also by\nstudying the Starobinsky model in the presence of the Chern-Simons term, we\ndemonstrate that it is possible to further reduce the amount of primordial\ngravitational radiation. The issues of having parity violating gravitational\nwaves, also the graceful exit from inflation due to axion oscillations and\nfinally the unification of dark energy-inflation and axion dark matter in the\nsame $f(R)$ gravity-axion dark matter model, are also briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 16:11:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 16:48:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

Such algorithms use the quantum device only to prepare parameterized\nquantum states and make simple measurements. A classical controller uses the\nmeasurement results to perform an optimization of a classical function induced\nby a quantum observable which defines the problem. While most prior works have\nconsidered optimization strategies based on estimating the objective function\nand doing a derivative-free or finite-difference-based optimization, some\nrecent proposals involve directly measuring observables corresponding to the\ngradient of the objective function. The measurement procedure needed requires\ncoherence time barely longer than that needed to prepare a trial state.

Accelerated nonthermal electrons have often been invoked as the primary\nmeans for transporting the bulk of the released energy to the lower solar\natmosphere. However, significant challenges remain for this scenario,\nespecially in accounting for the large number of accelerated electrons inferred\nfrom observations. Propagating magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) waves, particularly\nthose with subsecond/second-scale periods, have been proposed as an alternative\nmeans for transporting the released flare energy, likely alongside the electron\nbeams, while observational evidence remains elusive. Here we report a possible\ndetection of such waves in the late impulsive phase of a two-ribbon flare. This\nis based on ultrahigh cadence dynamic imaging spectroscopic observations of a\npeculiar type of decimetric radio bursts obtained by the Karl G. Jansky Very\nLarge Array. Radio imaging at each time and frequency pixel allows us to trace\nthe spatiotemporal motion of the source, which agrees with the implications of\nthe frequency drift pattern in the dynamic spectrum. The radio source,\npropagating at 1000--2000 km s$^{-1}$ in projection, shows close spatial and\ntemporal association with transient brightenings on the flare ribbon. In\naddition, multitudes of subsecond-period oscillations are present in the radio\nemission. We interpret the observed radio bursts as short-period MHD wave\npackets propagating along newly reconnected magnetic flux tubes linking to the\nflare ribbon. The estimated energy flux carried by the waves is comparable to\nthat needed to account for the plasma heating during the late impulsive phase\nof this flare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 16:43:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 02:19:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 14:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

One key aspect\nof this approach consists of computing integrals of singular kernels over the\ndiscretised domain, usually referred to as potential integrals. Several\ntechniques have been proposed for dealing with such integrals, all of them\napproximating the results at the expense of reducing the accuracy of the\nsolution. In this paper, we derive analytic formulas for the potential\nintegrals, reducing approximation errors to a minimum.\n  Approach: Based on volume coordinates and Gauss theorems, we obtained\nparametric expressions for all the element matrices needed in the formulation\nassuming first order basis functions defined on a tetrahedral mesh. This\nincluded solving potential integrals over triangles and tetrahedra, for which\nwe found compact and efficient formulas.\n  Main results: Comparison with numerical quadrature schemes allowed to test\nthe advantages of the methodology proposed, which were found of great relevance\nfor highly-eccentric sources, as those found in the somatosensory and visual\ncortices. Moreover, the availability of compact formulas allowed an efficient\nimplementation of the technique, which resulted in similar computational cost\nthan the simplest numerical scheme.\n  Significance: The analytical subtraction approach is the optimal\nsubtraction-based methodology with regard to accuracy. The computational cost\nis similar to that obtained with the lowest order numerical integration scheme,\nmaking it a competitive option in the field. The technique is highly relevant\nfor improving electromagnetic source imaging results utilising individualised\nhead models and anisotropic electric conductivity fields without imposing\nimpractical mesh requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 17:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-17"}

Intuitively, synergy is the\ninformation about the target variable that is uniquely obtained taking the\nsources together, but not considering them alone; redundancy is the information\nwhich is shared by the sources. To disentangle the components of the\ninformation both at the static level and at the dynamical one, the\ndecomposition is applied respectively to the mutual information and to the\ntransfer entropy between a given spin, the target, and a pair of neighbouring\nspins (taken as the drivers).

Using realistic mock data tests, we find that the ill-posed\nincomplete Fourier transform underlying the reconstruction requires careful\nregularization, for which both the Bayesian approach as well as neural networks\nare efficient and flexible choices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 17:46:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

Some results of Lindenbaum's, which bear his name,\nwere published without proofs by other people from the Lvov--Warsaw School and\nthe proofs later were provided by some others, though the authorship of\nLindenbaum has never been challenged. Many may have heard about Lindenbaum's\nlemma, asserting the existence of Lindenbaum's extension, and Lindenbaum-Tarski\nalgebra; less known is Lindenbaum's logical matrix. This tutorial is devoted to\nthe two last concepts rather than the first one. However, the latter can be\nunderstood in a purely algebraic fashion, if one employs the notion of\nLindenbaum-Tarski algebra. In general, the notions of Lindenbaum matrix and\nLindenbaum-Tarski algebra have paved a way to further algebraization of logic,\nwhich had been begun by George Boole in the 19th century, as well as to a new\nbranch of logic, model theory. For this reason, the present tutorial is also a\ngentle introduction to algebraic logic.\n  A uniting idea of the aforementioned concepts is a special view on the formal\njudgments of a formal language. It is this view we call the Lindenbaum method.\nAlthough Lindenbaum expressed merely a starting viewpoint in the tradition of\nPolish logic of the time, this viewpoint became a standard ever since and its\ndevelopment goes on until this day, continuing to shape the field of algebraic\nlogic. Our main objective is to demonstrate how this view gave rise to\nformulating the aforementioned concepts and how it opens door to unexplored\npaths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 17:53:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-17"}

Increasingly, data-related issues are equally as important as the\nalgorithmic methods used to process and learn from the data. Here we introduce\nan open source GPU-accelerated neural network (NN) framework for learning\nreactive potential energy surfaces (PESs), and investigate the use of real-time\ninteractive ab initio molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) as a new\nstrategy for rapidly sampling geometries along reaction pathways which can be\nused to train NNs to learn reactive PESs.

Both the NN trained\nusing iMD-VR data and the NN trained using the constrained MD data reproduce\nimportant qualitative features of the reactive PESs, such as a low and early\nbarrier to abstraction. Quantitatively, learning is sensitive to the training\ndataset.

This transition can be especially important in paramagnetic QAH\ninsulators, such as (Hg,Mn)Te/CdTe quantum wells, in which exchange interaction\nand orbital fields compete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 18:22:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 2019 16:54:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 10:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-13"}

In order to automate these analyses, in the last\nyears several binary analysis platforms have been introduced. These platforms\nshare a common design: the adoption of hardware-independent intermediate\nrepresentations, a mechanism to translate architecture dependent code to this\nrepresentation, and a set of architecture independent analyses that process the\nintermediate representation. The usage of these platforms to verify software\nintroduces the need for trusting both the correctness of the translation from\nbinary code to intermediate language (called transpilation) and the correctness\nof the analyses. Achieving a high degree of trust is challenging since the\ntranspilation must handle (i) all the side effects of the instructions, (ii)\nmultiple instruction encodings (e.g. ARM Thumb), and (iii) variable instruction\nlength (e.g. Intel). Similarly, analyses can use complex transformations (e.g.\nloop unrolling) and simplifications (e.g. partial evaluation) of the artifacts,\nwhose bugs can jeopardize correctness of the results. We overcome these\nproblems by developing a binary analysis platform on top of the interactive\ntheorem prover HOL4. First, we formally model a binary intermediate language\nand we prove correctness of several supporting tools (i.e. a type checker).\nThen, we implement two proof-producing transpilers, which respectively\ntranslate ARMv8 and CortexM0 programs to the intermediate language and generate\na certificate.

They therefore provide unique windows\ninto the formation of the first galaxies and the behavior of dark matter on\nsmall scales. In this review, we summarize the discovery of ultra-faint dwarfs\nin the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in 2005, and the subsequent observational and\ntheoretical progress in understanding their nature and origin. We describe\ntheir stellar kinematics, chemical abundance patterns, structural properties,\nstellar populations, orbits, and luminosity function, and what can be learned\nfrom each type of measurement. We conclude that: (1) in most cases, the stellar\nvelocity dispersions of ultra-faint dwarfs are robust against systematic\nuncertainties such as binary stars and foreground contamination; (2) the\nchemical abundance patterns of stars in ultra-faint dwarfs require two sources\nof r-process elements, one of which can likely be attributed to neutron star\nmergers; (3) even under conservative assumptions, only a small fraction of\nultra-faint dwarfs may have suffered significant tidal stripping of their\nstellar components; (4) determining the properties of the faintest dwarfs out\nto the virial radius of the Milky Way will require very large investments of\nobserving time with future telescopes.

The strength of the gradient\ncorrelates with overall galaxy age such that earlier star formation produces a\nmore pronounced gradient. The relation between formation time and strength of\nthe gradient is driven by both mergers and star-formation feedback. Mergers can\nboth steepen and flatten the age gradient depending on the timing of the merger\nand star formation history of the merging galaxy.

In the first\npaper, we successfully explained the peculiar MIR morphology of Circinus\nobserved on large, tens of parsec scales with a model consisting of a compact\ndusty disc and an extended hollow dusty cone. In this work, we further refine\nthe model on smaller, parsecs scales to test whether it can also explain the\nMIR interferometric data. We find that a model composed of a thin dusty disc\nseen almost edge-on and a polar outflow in the form of a hyperboloid shell can\nreproduce well the VLTI/MIDI observations at all wavelengths, baselines and\nposition angles. In contrast, while providing a good fit to the integrated MIR\nspectrum, the dusty torus model fails to reproduce the spatially resolved\ninterferometric data. We put forth the disc$+$hyperboloid wind model of\nCircinus AGN as a prototype for the dust structure in the AGN population with\npolar dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 19:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

The\nscarcity of nearby events and the brightness of the GRB afterglow, dominating\nthe first days of emission, have so far prevented the study of the very early\nstages of the GRB-SN evolution. Here we present detailed, multi-epoch\nspectroscopic observations of SN 2017iuk, associated with GRB 171205A which\ndisplay features at extremely high expansion velocities of $\\sim$ 100,000 km\ns$^{-1}$ within the first day after the burst. These high-velocity components\nare characterized by chemical abundances different from those observed in the\nejecta of SN 2017iuk at later times. Using spectral synthesis models developed\nfor the SN 2017iuk, we explain these early features as originating not from the\nsupernova ejecta, but from a hot cocoon generated by the energy injection of a\nmildly-relativistic GRB jet expanding into the medium surrounding the\nprogenitor star. This cocoon becomes rapidly transparent and is outshone by the\nsupernova emission which starts dominating three days after the burst. These\nresults proves that the jet plays an important role not only in powering the\nGRB event but also its associated supernova.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 19:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

The developed framework envisions a modular system, combining open\nresearch challenges in the fields of localization, path planning and mapping,\nwith an overall capability for a fast on site deployment and a reduced\nexecution time that can repeatably perform the inspection mission according to\nthe operator needs. The architecture of the established system includes: 1) a\ngeometry-based path planner for coverage of complex structures by multiple\nMAVs, 2) an accurate yet flexible localization component, which provides an\naccurate pose estimation for the MAVs by utilizing an Ultra Wideband fused\ninertial estimation scheme, and 3) visual data post-processing scheme for the\n3D model building. The performance of the proposed framework has been\nexperimentally demonstrated in multiple realistic outdoor field trials, all\nfocusing on the challenging structure of a wind turbine as the main test case.\nThe successful experimental results, depict the merits of the proposed\nautonomous navigation system as the enabling technology towards aerial robotic\ninspectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 19:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-18"}

The success of companies in that area is often related to\npredictive maintenance driven by advanced analytics. Therefore, accurate\nmodeling, as a way to understand how the complex interactions between operating\nconditions and component capability define useful life, is key for services\nprofitability. Unfortunately, building prognosis models for large fleets is a\ndaunting task as factors such as duty cycle variation, harsh environments,\ninadequate maintenance, and problems with mass production can lead to large\ndiscrepancies between designed and observed useful lives. This paper introduces\na novel physics-informed neural network approach to prognosis by extending\nrecurrent neural networks to cumulative damage models. We propose a new\nrecurrent neural network cell designed to merge physics-informed and\ndata-driven layers. With that, engineers and scientists have the chance to use\nphysics-informed layers to model parts that are well understood (e.g., fatigue\ncrack growth) and use data-driven layers to model parts that are poorly\ncharacterized (e.g., internal loads). A simple numerical experiment is used to\npresent the main features of the proposed physics-informed recurrent neural\nnetwork for damage accumulation. The test problem consist of predicting fatigue\ncrack length for a synthetic fleet of airplanes subject to different mission\nmixes. The model is trained using full observation inputs (far-field loads) and\nvery limited observation of outputs (crack length at inspection for only a\nportion of the fleet). The results demonstrate that our proposed hybrid\nphysics-informed recurrent neural network is able to accurately model fatigue\ncrack growth even when the observed distribution of crack length does not match\nwith the (unobservable) fleet distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 19:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-18"}

By using a\nneural inference network to approximate the model's posterior on latent\nvariables, VAEs efficiently parameterize a lower bound on marginal data\nlikelihood that can be optimized directly via gradient methods. In practice,\nhowever, VAE training often results in a degenerate local optimum known as\n\"posterior collapse\" where the model learns to ignore the latent variable and\nthe approximate posterior mimics the prior. In this paper, we investigate\nposterior collapse from the perspective of training dynamics. We find that\nduring the initial stages of training the inference network fails to\napproximate the model's true posterior, which is a moving target. As a result,\nthe model is encouraged to ignore the latent encoding and posterior collapse\noccurs. Based on this observation, we propose an extremely simple modification\nto VAE training to reduce inference lag: depending on the model's current\nmutual information between latent variable and observation, we aggressively\noptimize the inference network before performing each model update. Despite\nintroducing neither new model components nor significant complexity over basic\nVAE, our approach is able to avoid the problem of collapse that has plagued a\nlarge amount of previous work.

For UQ, stochastic methods (Monte Carlo\nsampling) and deterministic methods (using SA profiles) are used.

Using different methods,\nthe uncertainty in the MCFC responses is about 10%. Both SA and UQ methods\nagree on the importance ranking of the fuel cell operating temperature and\ncathode activation energy as the most influential parameters.

By inverting such\nrenderer, one can think of a learning approach to predict a 3D shape from an\ninput image. However, standard rendering pipelines involve a fundamental\ndiscretization step called rasterization, which prevents the rendering process\nto be differentiable, hence suitable for learning. We present the first\nnon-parametric and truly differentiable rasterizer based on silhouettes. Our\nmethod enables unsupervised learning for high-quality 3D mesh reconstruction\nfrom a single image. We call our framework `soft rasterizer' as it provides an\naccurate soft approximation of the standard rasterizer. The key idea is to fuse\nthe probabilistic contributions of all mesh triangles with respect to the\nrendered pixels. When combined with a mesh generator in a deep neural network,\nour soft rasterizer is able to generate an approximated silhouette of the\ngenerated polygon mesh in the forward pass. The rendering loss is\nback-propagated to supervise the mesh generation without the need of 3D\ntraining data. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised techniques, both quantitatively\nand qualitatively. We also show that our soft rasterizer can achieve comparable\nresults to the cutting-edge supervised learning method and in various cases\neven better ones, especially for real-world data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 00:00:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 00:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-24"}

This property is obtained through a random choice of the\nradius at which offspring are sampled from previously evaluated solutions. It\nis well known that, thanks to this global search behavior, the probability that\nan EA using standard bit mutation finds a global optimum of an arbitrary\nfunction $f:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ tends to one as the number of function\nevaluations grows. This advantage over heuristics using a fixed search radius,\nhowever, comes at the cost of using non-optimal step sizes also in those\nregimes in which the optimal rate is stable for a long time. This downside\nresults in significant performance losses for many standard benchmark problems.\n  We introduce in this work a simple way to interpolate between the random\nglobal search of EAs and their deterministic counterparts which sample from a\nfixed radius only. To this end, we introduce \\emph{normalized standard bit\nmutation}, in which the binomial choice of the search radius is replaced by a\nnormal distribution. Normalized standard bit mutation allows a straightforward\nway to control its variance, and hence the degree of randomness involved. We\nexperiment with a self-adjusting choice of this variance, and demonstrate its\neffectiveness for the two classic benchmark problems LeadingOnes and OneMax.\nOur work thereby also touches a largely ignored question in discrete\nevolutionary computation: multi-dimensional parameter control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 00:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-18"}

This has long been a challenging task as\ncustomer modelling is a multi-faceted, noisy and time-dependent problem. The\nmost common way to tackle this problem is indirectly through task-specific\nsupervised learning prediction problems, with relatively little literature on\nmodelling a customer by directly simulating their future transactions. In this\npaper we propose a method for generating realistic sequences of baskets that a\ngiven customer is likely to purchase over a period of time. Customer embedding\nrepresentations are learned using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which takes\ninto account the entire sequence of transaction data. Given the customer state\nat a specific point in time, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is trained\nto generate a plausible basket of products for the following week. The newly\ngenerated basket is then fed back into the RNN to update the customer's state.\nThe GAN is thus used in tandem with the RNN module in a pipeline alternating\nbetween basket generation and customer state updating steps. This allows for\nsampling over a distribution of a customer's future sequence of baskets, which\nthen can be used to gain insight into how to service the customer more\neffectively. The methodology is empirically shown to produce baskets that\nappear similar to real baskets and enjoy many common properties, including\nfrequencies of different product types, brands, and prices. Furthermore, the\ngenerated data is able to replicate most of the strongest sequential patterns\nthat exist between product types in the real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 01:24:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 03:05:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

Our proposed methodology\nfirst tackles the issue of exponential growth in variance with the time horizon\nby casting optimal control estimation as a smoothing problem for a state space\nmodel associated with the control problem, and applying smoothing algorithms\nbased on particle Markov chain Monte Carlo. To further reduce computational\ncost, we then develop a multilevel Monte Carlo method which allows us to obtain\nan estimator of the optimal control with $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^2)$ mean squared\nerror with a computational cost of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2}\\log(\\epsilon)^2)$. In contrast, a computational cost\nof $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$ is required for existing methodology to achieve\nthe same mean squared error. Our approach is illustrated on two numerical\nexamples, which validate our theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 01:39:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-26"}

It is found that the value of\n$\\alpha$ plays an extremely important role in the study of strong interaction\nphase diagram. It not only changes the position of the phase transition point\nof strong interaction matter, but also affects the order of phase transition,\nfor example, when $\\alpha$ is greater than the critical value $\\alpha_c =\n0.71$, then the strong interaction matter phase diagram no longer exists\ncritical end point. In addition, in the case of zero temperature and finite\ndensity, we also found that when $\\alpha$ is greater than 1.044, the\npseudo-critical chemical potential is about 4$\\sim$5 times the saturation\ndensity of the nuclear matter, which agrees with the expected results from the\nimage of hadrons degree of freedom.

We show that not all implanted TMs substitute cations\nbut can be stable in interstitial sites as well. Stability of TM (Sc--Zn)\ndopants in various charge states in MgO and BaO has been investigated in the\nframework of density functional theory. We propose an effective way to\ncalculate stability of implanted metals that let us predict site preference\n(interstitial or substitution) of the dopant in the host. We find that two\nfactors govern the preference for an interstitial site: i) relative ionic\nradius and ii) relative oxygen affinity of cation and the TM dopants. If the\nradius of the cation is much larger than TM dopant, as in BaO, TM atoms always\nsit at interstitial sites. On the other hand, if the radius of the cation is\ncomparable to that of the dopant TM, as in case of MgO, the transition of the\npreferred defect site, from substituting lattice Mg atom (Sc to Mn) to\noccupying interstitial site (Fe to Zn) is observed. This transition can be\nattributed to the change in the oxygen affinity of the TM atoms from Sc to Zn.\nOur results also explain experiments on Ni and Fe atoms implanted in MgO.

Moreover, for a range of parameters, the deformation obtained\nusing the alternating and direct electric fields is qualitatively different,\ni.e. for low $K_r$ and high $S$, the droplet becomes prolate under alternating\nelectric field but deforms to an oblate shape in the case of the equivalent\ndirect electric field. A parametric study is conducted by varying the time\nperiod of the applied alternating electric field, the permittivity and the\nelectrical conductivity ratios. It is observed that while increasing $K_r$ has\na negligible effect on the deformation dynamics of the droplet for $K_r<S$, it\nenhances the deformation of the droplet when $K_r>S$ for both alternating and\ndirect electric fields.

For effective teaming, a\nrobot must not only maintain a behavioral model of its human teammates to\nproject the team status, but also be aware that its human teammates'\nexpectation of itself. Being aware of the human teammates' expectation leads to\nrobot behaviors that better align with human expectation, thus facilitating\nmore efficient and potentially safer teams. Our work addresses the problem of\nhuman-robot cooperation with the consideration of such teammate models in\nsequential domains by leveraging the concept of plan explicability. In plan\nexplicability, however, the human is considered solely as an observer. In this\npaper, we extend plan explicability to consider interactive settings where\nhuman and robot behaviors can influence each other. We term this new measure as\nInteractive Plan Explicability. We compare the joint plan generated with the\nconsideration of this measure using the fast forward planner (FF) with the plan\ncreated by FF without such consideration, as well as the plan created with\nactual human subjects. Results indicate that the explicability score of plans\ngenerated by our algorithm is comparable to the human plan, and better than the\nplan created by FF without considering the measure, implying that the plans\ncreated by our algorithms align better with expected joint plans of the human\nduring execution.

The debris of a star whose initial spin is parallel to the orbital\nangular momentum has a mass distribution which extends to lower energy than\nthat of non-rotating star.

However it is precisely this emission rate that determines\nwhether the resulting radiation field behaves classically or non-classically.\nIt has been known nearly since the effect's discovery that a black hole's\nradiation is in this sense non-classical.

The derivation\nof recent equations of state for hydrogen and helium, much denser in the Mbar\nregion, worsen the conflict between these two observations. In order to\ncircumvent this puzzle, current Jupiter model studies either ignore the\nconstraint from Galileo or invoke an ad hoc modification of the equations of\nstate. In this paper, we derive Jupiter models which satisfy both Juno and\nGalileo constraints. We confirm that Jupiter's structure must encompass at\nleast four different regions: an outer convective envelope, a region of\ncompositional, thus entropy change, an inner convective envelope and an\nextended diluted core enriched in heavy elements, and potentially a central\ncompact core. We show that, in order to reproduce Juno and Galileo\nobservations, one needs a significant entropy increase between the outer and\ninner envelopes and a smaller density than for an isentropic profile,\nassociated with some external differential rotation. The best way to fulfill\nthis latter condition is an inward decreasing abundance of heavy elements in\nthis region. We examine in details the three physical mechanisms able to yield\nsuch a change of entropy and composition: a first order molecular-metallic\nhydrogen transition, immiscibility between hydrogen and helium or a region of\nlayered convection. Given our present knowledge of hydrogen pressure\nionization, combination of the two latter mechanisms seems to be the most\nfavoured solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 09:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

Until now,\nmost of these theorems have been derived for finite-dimensional systems.\nHowever, many relevant physical processes are described by systems of infinite\ndimension in the Gaussian regime. In this work, we find a linear response\ntheory for quantum Gaussian systems subject to time dependent Gaussian\nchannels. In particular, we establish a fluctuation dissipation theorem for the\ncovariance matrix that connects its linear response at any time to the steady\nstate two-time correlations. The theorem covers non-equilibrium scenarios as it\ndoes not require the steady state to be at thermal equilibrium. We further show\nhow our results simplify the study of Gaussian systems subject to a time\ndependent Lindbladian master equation. Finally, we illustrate the usage of our\nnew scheme through some examples. Due to broad generality of the Gaussian\nformalism, we expect our results to find an application in many physical\nplatforms, such as opto-mechanical systems in the presence of external noise or\ndriven quantum heat devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 10:06:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 13:18:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-22"}

This allows taking high-dimensional streaming context information,\nincluding client-measured variables and network assistance, to find online the\nmost valuable information for the quality adaptation. Since sparse Bayesian\nestimation is computationally expensive, we develop a fast new inference scheme\nto support online video adaptation.

Our analysis covers a broad spectrum of cosolute\nvalences z_c and electric dipole moments mu_c, as well as hydrogel swelling\nstates and hydrogel charge densities.

However, previous\nsharding related designs have two main limitations: Firstly, the throughput of\ntheir random-based sharding system is not high enough as they did not leverage\nthe heterogeneity among validators. Secondly, to design an incentive mechanism\nto promote cooperation could incur a huge overhead on their system. In this\npaper, we propose RepChain, a reputation-based secure and fast blockchain\nsystem via sharding, which also provides high incentive to stimulate node\ncooperation. RepChain utilizes reputation to explicitly characterize the\nheterogeneity among the validators and lay the foundation for the incentive\nmechanism. We propose a new double-chain architecture which includes\ntransaction chain and reputation chain. For transaction chain, a Raft-based\nsynchronous consensus that can achieve high throughput has been presented. For\nreputation chain, the synchronous Byzantine fault tolerance that combines\ncollective signing has been utilized to achieve a consensus on both reputation\nscore and the related transaction blocks. It supports a high throughput\ntransaction chain with moderate generation speed. Moreover, we propose a\nreputation-based sharding and leader selection scheme.

Performed experiments demonstrate that our method reaches top\nperformance, yielding better effectiveness scores than state-of-the-art\nbaseline methods and promoting large gains over the rankers being fused, thus\ndemonstrating the successful capability of the proposal in representing queries\nbased on a unified graph-based model of rank fusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 11:55:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 23:09:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-25"}

The crucial challenge is how to deal with abstract atomic blocking:\nthat is, abstract atomic operations that have blocking behaviour arising from\nbusy-waiting patterns as found in, for example, fine-grained spin locks. Our\nfundamental innovation is with the design of abstract specifications that\ncapture this blocking behaviour as liveness assumptions on the environment.

Surrogate assisted evolutionary\nalgorithms (SAEAs) have been widely used to solve this crucial problem in the\npast decades. However, most studied SAEAs focus on solving problems with a\nbudget of at least ten times of the dimension of problems which is unacceptable\nin many very expensive real-world problems. In this paper, we employ Voronoi\ndiagram to boost the performance of SAEAs and propose a novel framework named\nVoronoi-based efficient surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithm (VESAEA) for\nvery expensive problems, in which the optimization budget, in terms of fitness\nevaluations, is only 5 times of the problem's dimension. In the proposed\nframework, the Voronoi diagram divides the whole search space into several\nsubspace and then the local search is operated in some potentially better\nsubspace. Additionally, in order to trade off the exploration and exploitation,\nthe framework involves a global search stage developed by combining\nleave-one-out cross-validation and radial basis function surrogate model. A\nperformance selector is designed to switch the search dynamically and\nautomatically between the global and local search stages. The empirical results\non a variety of benchmark problems demonstrate that the proposed framework\nsignificantly outperforms several state-of-art algorithms with extremely\nlimited fitness evaluations.

We propose a novel scale aware feature\nencoder (SAFE) that is designed specifically for encoding characters with\ndifferent scales. SAFE is composed of a multi-scale convolutional encoder and a\nscale attention network. The multi-scale convolutional encoder targets at\nextracting character features under multiple scales, and the scale attention\nnetwork is responsible for selecting features from the most relevant scale(s).\nSAFE has two main advantages over the traditional single-CNN encoder used in\ncurrent state-of-the-art text recognizers. First, it explicitly tackles the\nscale problem by extracting scale-invariant features from the characters. This\nallows the recognizer to put more effort in handling other challenges in scene\ntext recognition, like those caused by view distortion and poor image quality.\nSecond, it can transfer the learning of feature encoding across different\ncharacter scales. This is particularly important when the training set has a\nvery unbalanced distribution of character scales, as training with such a\ndataset will make the encoder biased towards extracting features from the\npredominant scale. To evaluate the effectiveness of SAFE, we design a simple\ntext recognizer named scale-spatial attention network (S-SAN) that employs SAFE\nas its feature encoder, and carry out experiments on six public benchmarks.\nExperimental results demonstrate that S-SAN can achieve state-of-the-art (or,\nin some cases, extremely competitive) performance without any post-processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 12:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-18"}

For certain\n$\\psi$, Barnes's integral leads to an expansion of this determinant in terms of\nthe generalised hypergeometric ${}_nF_m$.

We detect narrow CO lines at the\nlocation of two MIR sources at galactocentric distances of about 8 kpc that are\nassociated with low-mass young stellar clusters, and at four locations in the\nproximity of MA1. The paucity of CO lines at the location of weak MIR-selected\nsources probably arises because most of them are not star-forming sites in M33,\nbut background sources. Although very uncertain, the total molecular mass of\nthe detected clouds around MA1 is lower than expected given the stellar mass of\nthe cluster, because dispersal of the molecular gas is taking place as the HII\nregion expands.

However, it is still challenging to produce a dense outdoor\nsemantic map from a monocular image stream. Motivated by this target, in this\npaper, we propose a method for large-scale 3D reconstruction from consecutive\nmonocular images. First, with the correlation of underlying information between\ndepth and semantic prediction, a novel multi-task Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) is designed for joint prediction. Given a single image, the network\nlearns low-level information with a shared encoder and separately predicts with\ndecoders containing additional Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) layers and\nthe residual connection which merits disparities and semantic mutually. To\novercome the inconsistency of monocular depth prediction for reconstruction,\npost-processing steps with the superpixelization and the effective 3D\nrepresentation approach are obtained to give the final semantic map.\nExperiments are compared with other methods on both semantic labeling and depth\nprediction. We also qualitatively demonstrate the map reconstructed from\nlarge-scale, difficult monocular image sequences to prove the effectiveness and\nsuperiority.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 14:31:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 05:45:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 01:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-25"}

Recently, a debate on the question of the convergence\nbehavior of the entropy stable nodal collocation discontinuous Galerkin\nspectral element method (DGSEM) with Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto nodes has emerged.\nWhereas it is well documented that the entropy conservative variant with no\nadditional interface dissipation shows an odd-even behavior when testing its\nexperimental convergence order, the results in the literature are less clear\nregarding the entropy stable version of the DGSEM-LGL, where explicit Riemann\nsolver type dissipation is added at the element interfaces. We contribute to\nthe ongoing discussion and present numerical experiments for the compressible\nEuler equations, where we investigate the effect of the choice of the numerical\nsurface flux function. In our experiments, it turns out that the choice of the\nnumerical surface flux has an impact on the convergence order. Penalty type\nnumerical fluxes with high dissipation in all waves, such as the LLF and the\nHLL flux, appear to affect the convergence order negatively for odd polynomial\ndegrees $N$, in contrast to the entropy conserving variant, where even\npolynomial degrees $N$ are negatively affected. This behavior is more\npronounced in low Mach number settings. In contrast, for numerical surface\nfluxes with less dissipative behavior in the contact wave such as e.g. Roe's\nflux, the HLLC flux and the entropy conservative flux augmented with 5-wave\nmatrix dissipation, optimal convergence rate of $N+1$ independent of the Mach\nnumber is observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 14:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-18"}

To meet the stringent delay\nrequirements of URLLC, the impact of short packet communication is taken into\naccount for resource allocation algorithm design. In particular, the resource\nallocation design is formulated as a weighted system sum throughput\nmaximization problem with quality-of-service (QoS) constraints for the URLLC\nusers. The formulated problem is non-convex, and hence, finding the global\noptimum solution entails a high computational complexity. Thus, an algorithm\nbased on successive convex optimization is proposed to find a sub-optimal\nsolution with polynomial time complexity.

A main risk\nis thermo-mechanical failure of the plasma-facing tungsten monoblocks, as a\nconsequence of irradiation hardening induced by neutron displacement cascades.\nLifetime extensions that could be carried out without prolonged maintenance\nperiods are desired. In this work, the effects of potential treatments for\nextending the lifetime of an operational reactor are explored. The proposed\ntreatments make use of cyclic recrystallization processes that can occur in\nneutron-irradiated tungsten. Evolution of the microstructure under\nnon-isothermal conditions is investigated, employing a multi-scale model that\nincludes a physically-based mean-field recrystallization model and a cluster\ndynamics model for neutron irradiation effects. The model takes into account\nmicrostructural properties such as grain size and displacement-induced defect\nconcentrations. The evolution of a hardness indicator under neutron irradiation\nwas studied. The results reveal that, for the given microstructure and under\nthe assumed model behaviour, periodical extra heating can have a significant\npositive influence on controlling the irradiation hardening. For example, at\n800 C, if extra annealing at 1200 C was applied after every 100 hrs for the\nduration of 1 hr, then the hardness indicator reduces from maximum 140 to below\n70.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 15:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

To enable detection of metastatic breast\ncancer (MBC), we applied a semi-supervised machine learning framework to linked\nEMR-California Cancer Registry (CCR) data. Materials and Methods: We studied\n11,459 female patients treated at Stanford Health Care who received an incident\nbreast cancer diagnosis from 2000-2014.

They lack capabilities to\ncontrol information flow, which may preclude their ability to meet application\nneeds, including the need to propagate different information types\nsimultaneously to different target locations within corresponding time delay\nbounds. This study proposes a queuing-based modeling approach to control the\npropagation of information flow of multiple classes. Two control parameters\nassociated with a vehicle are leveraged to control the propagation performance\nof different information classes. A two-layer model is developed to\ncharacterize the information flow propagation wave (IFPW) under the designed\nqueuing strategy. The upper layer is formulated as integro-differential\nequations to characterize the spatiotemporal information dissemination due to\nV2V communication. The lower layer characterizes the traffic flow dynamics\nusing the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model. The analytical solution of the\nasymptotic density of informed vehicles and the necessary condition for\nexistence of the IFPW are derived for homogeneous traffic conditions. Numerical\nexperiments provide insights on the impact of the mean communication service\nrate on information spread and its spatial coverage. Further, a numerical\nsolution method is developed to solve the two-layer model, which aids in\nestimating the impacts of the control parameters in the queuing strategy on the\nIFPW speed under homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions. The proposed\nmodeling approach enables controlling the propagation of information of\ndifferent information classes to meet application needs, which can assist\ntraffic managers to design effective and efficient traffic management and\ncontrol strategies under V2V communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 01:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

However, the\nquantum mechanical wave does not distinguish between the right and left\ndirections as long as the time-reversal symmetry is intact, and it is a highly\nnontrivial issue how the nonreciprocal nature originates in quantum systems.\nHere we demonstrate by the quantum ratchet model, i.e., a quantum particle in\nan asymmetric periodic potential, that the dissipation characterized by a\ndimensionless coupling constant $\\alpha$ plays an essential role for nonlinear\nnonreciprocal response. The temperature ($T$) dependence of the second order\nnonlinear mobility $\\mu_2$ is found to be $\\mu_2 \\sim T^{6/\\alpha -4 }$ for\n$\\alpha<1$, and $\\mu_2 \\sim T^{2(\\alpha -1)}$ for $\\alpha>1$, respectively,\nwhere $\\alpha_c=1$ is the critical point of the localization-delocalization\ntransition, i.e., Schmid transition.

Their applications range from laser physics, atomic clocks,\nmolecular spectroscopy, and single-photon generation to the detection, trapping\nand cooling of atoms or nano-scale objects. Many of these applications benefit\nfrom strong mode confinement and high optical quality factors, making small\nmirrors of high surface-quality desirable. Building such devices in silicon\nyields ultra-low absorption at telecom wavelengths and enables integration of\nmicro-structures with mechanical, electrical and other functionalities. Here,\nwe push optical resonator technology to new limits by fabricating\nlithographically aligned silicon mirrors with ultra-smooth surfaces, small and\nwellcontrolled radii of curvature, ultra-low loss and high reflectivity. We\nbuild large arrays of microcavities with finesse greater than F = 500,000 and a\nmode volume of 330 femtoliters at wavelengths near 1550 nm. Such high-quality\nmicro-mirrors open up a new regime of optics and enable unprecedented\nexplorations of strong coupling between light and matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 17:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}
