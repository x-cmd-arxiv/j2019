The proposed technique extends\nthe reduced-order-model error surrogates (ROMES) method to closure modeling.\nThe original ROMES method applied Gaussian-process regression to construct a\nstatistical model that maps cheaply computable error indicators (e.g., residual\nnorm, dual-weighted residuals) to a random variable for either (1) the norm of\nthe state error or (2) the error in a scalar-valued quantity of interest.\nRather than target these two types of errors, this work proposes to construct a\nstatistical model for the state error itself; it achieves this by constructing\nstatistical models for the generalized coordinates characterizing both the\nin-plane error (i.e., the error in the trial subspace) and a low-dimensional\napproximation of the out-of-plane error. The former can be considered a\nstatistical closure model, as it quantifies the error in the ROM generalized\ncoordinates. Because any quantity of interest can be computed as a functional\nof the state, the proposed approach enables any quantity-of-interest error to\nbe statistically quantified a posteriori, as the state-error model can be\npropagated through the associated quantity-of-interest functional. Numerical\nexperiments performed on both linear and nonlinear stationary systems\nillustrate the ability of the technique (1) to improve (expected) ROM\nprediction accuracy by an order of magnitude, (2) to statistically quantify the\nerror in arbitrary quantities of interest, and (3) to realize a more\ncost-effective methodology for reducing the error than a ROM-only approach in\nthe case of nonlinear systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 16:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-10"}

Under the assumption that the difference vector is sparse and that\nits Hamming weight is at the most a known constant, the objective is to design\na linear code with as small a codelength as possible that allows successful\nupdate of the linear function at the receiver. This problem is motivated by\napplications to distributed data storage systems. Recently, Prakash and Medard\nderived a lower bound on the codelength, which is independent of the size of\nthe underlying finite field, and provided constructions that achieve this bound\nif the size of the finite field is sufficiently large. However, this\nrequirement on the field size can be prohibitive for even moderate values of\nthe system parameters.

This is of particular\ninterest for the emergence and sustainability of land-based life, but orbital\nand rotational parameters of exoplanets are still poorly constrained. Numerical\nexplorations usually realised in this situation are thus in heavy contrast with\nthe uncertain nature of the available data.\n  Aims: We aim to provide an analytical formulation of the long-term spin-axis\ndynamics of exoplanets, linking it directly to physical and dynamical\nparameters, but still giving precise quantitative results if the parameters are\nwell known. Together with bounds for the poorly constrained parameters of\nexoplanets, this analysis is designed to allow a quick and straightforward\nexploration of the spin-axis dynamics.\n  Methods: The long-term orbital solution is decomposed in quasi-periodic\nseries and the spin-axis Hamiltonian is expanded in powers of eccentricity and\ninclination. Chaotic zones are measured by the resonance overlap criterion.\nBounds for the poorly known parameters of exoplanets are obtained from physical\ngrounds (rotational breakup) and dynamical considerations (equipartition of\nAMD).\n  Results: This method gives accurate results when the orbital evolution is\nwell known. The chaotic zones for planets of the Solar System can be retrieved\nin details from simple analytical formulas. For less constrained planetary\nsystems, the maximal extent of the chaotic regions can be computed, requiring\nonly the mass, the semi-major axis and the eccentricity of the planets present\nin the system.

Asymmetry in a tethered\nmembrane causes spontaneous curvature, which in general depends upon the local\nin-plane dilation of the tethered network.

This interplay between asymmetry and\nGaussian curvature leads to a new {\\em double-spiral} phase not found in\nsymmetric tethered membranes. At temperature $T=0$, tethered membranes of\narbitrarily large size are always rolled up tightly into a conjoined pair of\nArchimedes' spirals. At finite $T$ this spiral structure swells up\nsignificantly into algebraic spirals characterized by universal exponents which\nwe calculate. These spirals have long range orientational order, and are the\nasymmetric analogs of statistically flat symmetric tethered membranes. We also\nfind that sufficiently strong asymmetry can trigger a structural instability\nleading to crumpling of these membranes as well. This provides a new route to\ncrumpling for asymmetric tethered membranes.

The model proposes that\nUltima Thule condensed from the first gas ring shed by the gravitationally\ncontracting protosolar cloud. I use the fully quantified gas ring model to\ncompute the thermal properties of the gas ring in which Ultima condensed and\nthence to predict the initial bulk chemical composition of the condensate. It\nis predicted that all KBOs initially contained large stores of CO2 ice and CH4\nices. These make up fractions 0.2210 and 0.0513 of the condensate mass,\nrespectively. Water ice makes up a mass fraction 0.1845, nearly-dry rock has\nfraction 0.5269 and graphite has 0.0163. Next, I compute the thermal evolution\nof Ultima, taking into account the radiogenic heat released by the decay of\n26Al. Stellar occultation data suggest that Ultima Thule may consist of 2 lobes\nof radius about 10 km and 7.5 km. The thermal evolution model shows that within\n0.2 Myr, the peak internal temperatures are sufficient for a fraction ~0.7 of\nthe CH4 ice in the larger lobe to melt and for a fraction ~0.4 of the CO2 ice\nto sublime. For the smaller lobe, these fractions are less. Liquid CH4 quickly\nmigrates upwards to the surface and refreezes to form a thick outer shell of\nCH4 ice. The sublimation of CO2 takes place after the melting of CH4. The\npossibility now exists for rising CO2 vapour to become trapped beneath the CH4\nshell. This may lead to explosive eruptions of the outer shell and destruction\nof the primordial surface of Ultima and loss of the CO2. If 60% of CO2 is lost,\nthe lobe radii each shrinks by ~5%. Even so, the intensity of 26Al radiogenic\nheating may not be sufficient to render the surface of Ultima Thule globally\nsmooth, unless the lobe sizes are of order ~15 km.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 17:57:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 12:37:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-21"}

We improve the Dense Basis SFH reconstruction method of\nIyer & Gawiser (2017), introducing a nonparametric description of the SFH based\non the lookback times at which a galaxy assembles certain quantiles of its\nstellar mass. The method uses Gaussian Processes to create smooth SFHs that are\nindependent of any functional form, with a flexible number of parameters that\nis adjusted to extract the maximum possible amount of SFH information from the\nSEDs being fit. We apply the method to reconstruct the SFHs of 48,791 galaxies\nwith $H<25$ at $0.5 < z < 3.0$ across the five CANDELS fields. Using these\nSFHs, we study the evolution of galaxies as they grow more massive over cosmic\ntime. We quantify the fraction of galaxies that show multiple major episodes of\nstar formation, finding that the median time between two peaks of star\nformation is $\\sim 0.42_{-0.10}^{+0.15}t_{univ}$ Gyr, where $t_{univ}$ is the\nage of the universe at a given redshift and remains roughly constant with\nstellar mass. Correlating SFHs with morphology, we find that studying the\nmedian SFHs of galaxies at $0.5<z<1.0$ at the same mass ($10^{10}< M_* <\n10^{10.5}M_\\odot$) allows us to compare the timescales on which the SFHs\ndecline for different morphological classifications, ranging from\n$0.60^{-0.54}_{+1.54}$ Gyr for galaxies with spiral arms to\n$2.50^{-1.50}_{+2.25}$ Gyr for spheroids. The Gaussian Process-based SFH\ndescription provides a general approach to reconstruct smooth, nonparametric\nSFH posteriors for galaxies with a flexible number of parameters that can be\nincorporated into Bayesian SED fitting codes to minimize the bias in estimating\nphysical parameters due to SFH parametrization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 18:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

Such TDs will show variability in their light curve\nfrom the orbital motion of the disruptive BBHs, and can therefore be used to\nmap the BBH orbital period distribution, and thereby also the dynamical\nmechanisms that eventually drive the BBHs to merger. Using an analytical\napproach including General Relativistic effects, we find that the orbital\nperiod distribution of BBHs within globular clusters peaks on timescales of\ndays, which we argue is unique to this assembly pathway.

Normally, this the technique requires the assumption of\nlateral homogeneity, which makes the horizontal slowness components at depths\nof downhole receivers equal to those measured at the surface. Any violations of\nthis assumption, such as lateral heterogeneity or a nonzero dip of intermediate\ninterfaces, lead to distortions in reconstructed slowness surfaces and,\nconsequently, to errors in estimated anisotropic parameters. Here, we relax the\nassumption of lateral homogeneity and discuss how to correct VSP data for weak,\nlateral heterogeneity (LH). We describe a procedure of downward continuation of\nrecorded travel times that accounts for the presence of both vertical\ninhomogeneity and weak lateral heterogeneity, which produces correct slowness\nsurfaces at depths of downhole receivers. Once the slowness surfaces are found\nand the desired type of anisotropic model to be inverted is selected, the\ncorresponding anisotropic parameters, providing the best fit to the estimated\nslowness can be obtained.

Five parameters of\nthis model -- the $P$-wave velocity $V_0$ in the direction of the symmetry\naxis, Thomsen's anisotropic coefficients $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$, the tilt\n$\\nu$, and the azimuth $\\beta$ of the symmetry axis can be estimated in a\nstable manner when maximum source offset is greater than half of the receiver\ndepth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 20:10:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

The underlying process, termed as the Organic Solid-Solid\nWetting Deposition (OSWD), generates two-dimensional adsorbates directly from\ndispersed three-dimensional organic crystals. This straightforward process has\nimportant implications in various fields of research and technology, such as in\nthe domains of low-dimensional crystal engineering, the chemical doping and\nband-gap engineering of graphene, and in the area of field-effect transistor\nfabrication. However, till date, lack of an in-depth understanding of the\nphysico-chemical basis of the OSWD prevented the identification of important\nparameters, essential to achieve a better control of the growth of monolayers\nand supramolecular assemblies with defined structures, sizes, and coverage\nareas. Here we propose a detailed model for the OSWD, derived from experimental\nand theoretical results that have been acquired by using the organic\nsemiconductor quinacridone as an example system. The model reveals the vital\nrole of the zeta potential and includes Casimir-like fluctuation-induced forces\nand the effect of dewetting in hydrophobic nano-confinements. Based on our\nresults, the OSWD of insoluble organic molecules can hence be applied to\nenvironmental friendly and low-cost dispersing agents, such as water. In\naddition, the model substantially enhances the ability to control the OSWD in\nterms of adsorbate structure and substrate coverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 20:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-11"}

In standard approaches to heritability\nestimation with LMMs, a genetic relationship matrix (GRM) must be specified. In\nGWAS, the GRM is frequently a correlation matrix estimated from the study\npopulation's genotypes, which corresponds to a normalized Euclidean distance\nkernel. In this paper, we show that reliance on the Euclidean distance kernel\ncontributes to several unresolved modeling inconsistencies in heritability\nestimation for GWAS. These inconsistencies can cause biased heritability\nestimates in the presence of linkage disequilibrium (LD), depending on the\ndistribution of causal variants.

The storage code is a locally\nrepairable code (LRC) with maximal recoverability (MR), and in particular, with\noptimal global minimum distance, for arbitrary code parameters: Number of local\ngroups $ g $, locality $ r $, local distance $ \\delta $, dimension $ k \\leq gr\n$ and length $ n = g(r + \\delta - 1) $. Servers are identified bijectively with\nlocal groups, and only locally non-redundant information is considered and\ndownloaded from each server, that is, only $ r $ nodes (out of $ r+\\delta-1 $)\nare considered per server. When the remaining MDS code, after removing all\nlocally redundant nodes, is a linearized Reed-Solomon code, a PIR scheme is\nprovided achieving the (download) rate $ R = (N - k - rt + 1)/N $, where $ N =\ngr = n - g(\\delta - 1) $ is the length of the restricted MDS code, for any $ t\n$ colluding servers such that $ k + rt \\leq N $. The field size is roughly $\ng^r $, polynomial in the number of servers $ g $. Assume an arbitrarily large\nnumber of stored files. If $ N - k - rt = 0 $, the rate $ R = 1/N $ is the\nhighest known and coincides with that of previous PIR schemes that work for any\nMDS storage code.

However,\nits thermal conductivity is significantly lower than those of other wide\nbandgap semiconductors, such as AlN, SiC, GaN, and diamond. To ensure reliable\noperation with minimal selfheating at high power, proper thermal management is\neven more essential for Ga2O3 devices. Similarly to the past approaches aiming\nto alleviate selfheating in GaN HEMTs, a possible solution has been to\nintegrate thin Ga2O3 membranes with diamond to fabricate Ga2O3 on diamond\nlateral MESFET or MOSFET devices by taking advantage of the ultra high thermal\nconductivity of diamond. Even though the TBC between wide bandgap semiconductor\ndevices such as GaN HEMTs and a diamond substrate is of primary importance for\nheat dissipation in these devices, fundamental understanding of the Ga2O3\ndiamond thermal interface is still missing. In this work, we study the thermal\ntransport across the interfaces of Ga2O3 exfoliated onto a single crystal\ndiamond. The Van der Waals bonded Ga2O3 diamond TBC is measured to be 17\nMWm2K1, which is comparable to the TBC of several physical vapor deposited\nmetals on diamond. A Landauer approach is used to help understand phonon\ntransport across perfect Ga2O3 diamond interface, which in turn sheds light on\nthe possible TBC one could achieve with an optimized interface. A reduced\nthermal conductivity of the Ga2O3 nanomembrane is also observed due to\nadditional phonon membrane boundary scattering. The impact of the\nGa2O3substrate TBC and substrate thermal conductivity on the thermal\nperformance of a power device are modeled and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 22:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-11"}

How robust is this speedup to noise on the\noracle? To answer this, we construct phenomenological short-range and\nlong-range noise models, and noise models that break or preserve the reflection\nsymmetry of the spectrum. We show that under the long-range noise models an\nexponential quantum speedup is retained. However, we argue that a classical\nalgorithm with an equivalent long-range noise model also exhibits an\nexponential speedup over the noiseless model. In the quantum setting the\nlong-range noise is able to lift the spectral gap of the problem so that the\nevolution changes from diabatic to adiabatic. In the classical setting,\nlong-range noise creates a significant probability of the walker landing\ndirectly on the EXIT vertex. Under short-range noise the exponential speedup is\nlost, but a polynomial quantum speedup is retained for sufficiently weak noise.\nIn contrast to noise range, we find that breaking of spectral symmetry by the\nnoise has no significant impact on the performance of the noisy algorithms. Our\nresults about the long-range models highlight that care must be taken in\nselecting phenomenological noise models so as not to change the nature of the\ncomputational problem.

Linear, Gaussian, Lorentzian and\nP\\\"oschl-Teller superlattice potential profiles have been assessed. A\nrelativistic description of electrons in graphene as well as the transfer\nmatrix method have been used to obtain the transmission properties. We find\nthat is not possible to have perfect or nearly perfect pass bands in gated\nGSLs. Regardless of the potential profile and the number of barriers there are\nremanent oscillations in the transmission bands. On the contrary, nearly\nperfect pass bands are obtained for gapped GSLs. The Gaussian profile is the\nbest option when the number of barriers is reduced, and there is practically no\ndifference among the profiles for large number of barriers. We also find that\nboth gated and gapped GSLs can work as omnidirectional band-pass filters. In\nthe case of gated Gaussian GSLs the omnidirectional range goes from\n-$50^{\\circ}$ to $50^{\\circ}$ with an energy bandwidth of 55 meV, while for\ngapped Gaussian GSLs the range goes from -$80^{\\circ}$ to $80^{\\circ}$ with a\nbandwidth of 40 meV. Here, it is important that the energy range does not\ninclude remanent oscillations. On the light of these results, the hole states\ninside the barriers of gated GSLs are not beneficial for band-pass filtering.\nSo, the flatness of the pass bands is determined by the superlattice potential\nprofile and the chiral nature of the charge carriers in graphene. Moreover, the\nwidth and the number of electron pass bands can be modulated through the\nsuperlattice structural parameters.

The capacity of DSSs\nis obtained as a function of node storage and repair bandwidth parameters,\ncharacterizing the tradeoff. There are lots of works on DSSs with clusters\n(racks) where the repair bandwidths from intra-cluster and cross-cluster are\ndifferentiated.

The multi-object\nrectification network is designed for rectifying images that contain irregular\ntext. It decreases the difficulty of recognition and enables the\nattention-based sequence recognition network to more easily read irregular\ntext.

Our findings suggest\nthat the system falls into two-dimensional dynamic percolation universality\nclass and the quenched random disorder is irrelevant, in agreement with results\nfor classical percolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 06:20:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 04:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-31"}

The single feature always contains onefold geometric\ninformation, which cannot characterize the 3D shapes well. Therefore, the\nmultiple features should be used for the retrieval task to overcome the\nlimitation of single feature and further improve the performance. However, most\nconventional distance metric learning methods fail to integrate the\ncomplementary information from multiple features to construct the distance\nmetric. To address these issue, a novel multi-feature distance metric learning\nmethod for non-rigid 3D shape retrieval is presented in this study, which can\nmake full use of the complimentary geometric information from multiple shape\nfeatures by utilizing the KL-divergences. Minimizing KL-divergence between\ndifferent metric of features and a common metric is a consistency constraints,\nwhich can lead the consistency shared latent feature space of the multiple\nfeatures.

The deterministic tendency of\nthe biased walker makes the forays away from the focal point more unlikely when\ncompared to the random nature of the returns of the resetting walker. This\ndifference has consequences on the spatio-temporal dynamics at intermediate\ntimes.

On the\nother hand, creating a complex speckle pattern with wavelength-limited spatial\nfeatures is effortless and can be implemented via a simple random diffuser.\nWith this observation and inspired by the concept of near-field ptychography,\nwe report a new imaging modality, termed near-field Fourier ptychography, for\ntackling high-resolution imaging challenges in both microscopic and macroscopic\nimaging settings. The meaning of 'near-field' is referred to placing the object\nat a short defocus distance with a large Fresnel number.

In a\nmicroscopic imaging setup, we use a 0.12 numerical aperture (NA) lens to\nachieve a NA of 0.85 in the reconstruction process.

Once intra-peptide van der\nWaal interactions dominate, the chain collapses along a nonequilibrium pathway\ncharacterized by formation of pearl-necklace-like local clusters as\nintermediates that eventually coagulate into a single globule. By describing\nthis coarsening through the contact probability as a function of distance along\nthe chain, we extract a time-dependent length scale that grows in linear\nfashion. The collapse dynamics is characterized by a dynamical critical\nexponent $z=0.5$ that is much smaller than the values of $z=1-2$ reported for\nnon-biological polymers.

However, automatically recognizing social relations\nin images is a challenging task due to the significant gap between the domains\nof visual content and social relation. Existing studies separately process\nvarious features such as faces expressions, body appearance, and contextual\nobjects, thus they cannot comprehensively capture the multi-granularity\nsemantics, such as scenes, regional cues of persons, and interactions among\npersons and objects. To bridge the domain gap, we propose a Multi-Granularity\nReasoning framework for social relation recognition from images. The global\nknowledge and mid-level details are learned from the whole scene and the\nregions of persons and objects, respectively. Most importantly, we explore the\nfine-granularity pose keypoints of persons to discover the interactions among\npersons and objects. Specifically, the pose-guided Person-Object Graph and\nPerson-Pose Graph are proposed to model the actions from persons to object and\nthe interactions between paired persons, respectively. Based on the graphs,\nsocial relation reasoning is performed by graph convolutional networks.\nFinally, the global features and reasoned knowledge are integrated as a\ncomprehensive representation for social relation recognition.

The key to deal with such problem is to disambiguate the candidate\nlabel sets and obtain the correct assignments between instances and their\ncandidate labels. In this paper, we interpret such assignments as\ninstance-to-label matchings, and reformulate the task of PLL as a matching\nselection problem. To model such problem, we propose a novel Graph Matching\nbased Partial Label Learning (GM-PLL) framework, where Graph Matching (GM)\nscheme is incorporated owing to its excellent capability of exploiting the\ninstance and label relationship. Meanwhile, since conventional one-to-one GM\nalgorithm does not satisfy the constraint of PLL problem that multiple\ninstances may correspond to the same label, we extend a traditional one-to-one\nprobabilistic matching algorithm to the many-to-one constraint, and make the\nproposed framework accommodate to the PLL problem. Moreover, we also propose a\nrelaxed matching prediction model, which can improve the prediction accuracy\nvia GM strategy.

They provide a signaling scheme that allows members of an elite to\ndistinguish themselves from the rest of society. Efforts to understand the\ndynamics of art and fashion cycles have been based on 'bottom-up' and 'top\ndown' theories. According to 'top down' theories, elite members signal their\nsuperior status by introducing new symbols (e.g., fashion styles), which are\nadopted by low-status groups. In response to this adoption, elite members would\nneed to introduce new symbols to signal their status. According to many\n'bottom-up' theories, style cycles evolve from lower classes and follow an\nessentially random pattern. We propose an alternative explanation based on\ncounter-dominance signaling. There, elite members want others to imitate their\nsymbols; changes only occur when outsider groups successfully challenge the\nelite by introducing signals that contrast those endorsed by the elite.

The goal of this paper is to study\ncustomers' behavior in an unobservable Markovian M/M/1 queue where consumers\nhave to choose between two strategic decisions about information acquisition\nbefore joining or not the queue. According to their decision, customers decide\nto give up the service (balk the system) or to join the queue. We study the\nNash equilibrium strategies: we compute the equilibrium and we prove its\nexistence and uniqueness. Based on this result, we consider the problem of\nrevenue maximization where the provider has to choose between two charging\nmechanisms: to charge the access to the system or to charge the queue length\ninformation to new incoming customers. We propose an heuristic algorithm to\nsolve the considered problem and numerical experiments have been conducted in\norder to illustrate the result.

We prove both numerically and analytically\nthat the cycling frequencies obey a power-law as a function of distance between\nthe tracked degrees of freedom. Importantly, the behavior of the cycling\nfrequencies contains information about the dimensionality of the system and the\namplitude of active noise. The mapping we use in our analytical approach thus\noffers a convenient framework for predicting the behavior of two-point\nnon-equilibrium measures for a given activity distribution in the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 12:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

Here, we additionally observe a frailty relationship\nbetween a PGW distribution with one value of the parameter which controls\ndistributional choice within the family and a PGW distribution with a smaller\nvalue of the same parameter. We exploit this frailty relationship to propose a\nbivariate shared frailty model with PGW marginal distributions: these marginals\nturn out to be linked by the so-called BB9 or \"power variance function\" copula.\nThis particular choice of copula is, therefore, a natural one in the current\ncontext.

This generality is achieved using four basic\ndistributional parameters: two scale-type parameters and two shape parameters.\nGeneralising to covariate dependence, the scale-type regression components\ncorrespond to accelerated failure time (AFT) and proportional hazards (PH)\nmodels. Therefore, this general formulation unifies the most popular survival\nmodels which allows us to consider the practical value of possible modelling\nchoices for survival data. Furthermore, in line with our proposed flexible\nbaseline distribution, we advocate the use of multi-parameter regression in\nwhich more than one distributional parameter depends on covariates - rather\nthan the usual convention of having a single covariate-dependent (scale)\nparameter. While many choices are available, we suggest introducing covariates\nthrough just one or other of the two scale parameters, which covers AFT and PH\nmodels, in combination with a `power' shape parameter, which allows for more\ncomplex non-AFT/non-PH effects, while the other shape parameter remains\ncovariate-independent, and handles automatic selection of the baseline\ndistribution.

Equilibrium correlations in fluids provide an\nextensively studied paradigmatic case, in which their range is typically\nbounded by the correlation length. Out of equilibrium, conservation laws have\nbeen found to extend correlations beyond this length, leading, instead, to\nalgebraic decays. In this context, here we present a systematic study of the\ncorrelations and forces in fluids driven out of equilibrium simultaneously by\nquenching and shearing, both for non-conserved as well as for conserved\nLangevin-type dynamics.

Both shearing and quenching lead to long-ranged correlations,\nwhich, however, differ in their nature as well as in their prefactors, and\nwhich are mixed up by applying both perturbations. These correlations are\nemployed to compute non-equilibrium fluctuation-induced forces in the presence\nof shear, with or without quenching, thereby generalizing the framework set out\nby Dean and Gopinathan.

We aim to resolve and investigate the spatial structure\nof molecular clouds traced by several molecules detected in absorption along\nthe line of sight to SgrB2(N). We have used spectral line data from the EMoCA\nsurvey performed with ALMA, taking advantage of the high sensitivity and\nangular resolution. We identify, on the basis of the spectral analysis of\nc-C3H2 across the field of view, 15 main velocity components along the line of\nsight to SgrB2(N) and several components in the envelope of SgrB2. The c-C3H2\ncolumn densities reveal two categories of clouds. Clouds in Category I (3 kpc\narm, 4 kpc arm, and some GC clouds) have smaller c-C3H2 column densities,\nsmaller linewidths, and smaller widths of their column density PDFs than clouds\nin Category II (Scutum arm, Sgr arm, and other GC clouds). To investigate the\nspatial structure we derive opacity maps for the following molecules: c-C3H2,\nH13CO+, 13CO, HNC, HN13C, HC15N, CS, C34S, 13CS, SiO, SO, and CH3OH. These maps\nreveal that most molecules trace relatively homogeneous structures that are\nmore extended than the field of view defined by the background continuum\nemission (about 15\", that is 0.08-0.6pc depending on the distance). SO and SiO\nshow more complex structures with smaller clumps of size ~5-8\". Our analysis\nsuggests that the driving of the turbulence is mainly solenoidal in the\ninvestigated clouds. On the basis of HCO+, we conclude that most line-of-sight\nclouds towards SgrB2 are translucent, including all clouds where complex\norganic molecules were recently detected. We also conclude that CCH and CH are\ngood probes of H2 in both diffuse and translucent clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 15:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

In this article, we focus on the opposite process,\ninvestigating the possibility that fullerenes form from small PAHs, in which\nbowl-forming plays a central role. We combine laboratory experiments and\nquantum chemical calculations to study the formation of larger PAHs from\ncharged fluorene clusters. The experiments show that with visible laser\nirradiation, the fluorene dimer cation -\n[C$_{13}$H$_{9}$$-$C$_{13}$H$_{9}$]$^+$ - and the fluorene trimer cation -\n[C$_{13}$H$_{9}$$-$C$_{13}$H$_{8}$$-$C$_{13}$H$_{9}$]$^+$ - undergo\nphoto-dehydrogenation and photo-isomerization resulting in bowl structured\naromatic cluster-ions, C$_{26}$H$_{12}$$^+$ and C$_{39}$H$_{20}$$^+$,\nrespectively. To study the details of this chemical process, we employ quantum\nchemistry that allows us to determine the structures of the newly formed\ncluster-ions, to calculate the hydrogen loss dissociation energies, and to\nderive the underlying reaction pathways. These results demonstrate that smaller\nPAH clusters (with less than 60 C-atoms) can convert to larger bowled\ngeometries that might act as building blocks for fullerenes, as the\nbowl-forming mechanism greatly facilitates the conversion from dehydrogenated\nPAHs to cages. Moreover, the bowl-forming induces a permanent dipole moment\nthat - in principle - allows to search for such species using radio astronomy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 05:38:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

As the\nsurgical materials are deformable, it requires a comprehensive tensioning\npolicy to yield appropriate tensioning direction at each step of the cutting\nprocess. Automating a tensioning policy for a given cutting trajectory will\nsupport not only the human surgeons but also the surgical robots to improve the\ncutting accuracy and reliability. This paper presents a multiple pinch point\napproach to modelling an autonomous tensioning planner based on a deep\nreinforcement learning algorithm. Experiments on a simulator show that the\nproposed method is superior to existing methods in terms of both performance\nand robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 13:30:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}

It is why it is not uncommon to include visualizations of training set\nnearest neighbors, to suggest generated images are not simply memorized. We\ndemonstrate this is not sufficient and motivates the need to study\nmemorization/overfitting of deep generators with more scrutiny. This paper\naddresses this question by i) showing how simple losses are highly effective at\nreconstructing images for deep generators ii) analyzing the statistics of\nreconstruction errors when reconstructing training and validation images, which\nis the standard way to analyze overfitting in machine learning. Using this\nmethodology, this paper shows that overfitting is not detectable in the pure\nGAN models proposed in the literature, in contrast with those using hybrid\nadversarial losses, which are amongst the most widely applied generative\nmethods. The paper also shows that standard GAN evaluation metrics fail to\ncapture memorization for some deep generators.

During their cellular uptake, the\nparticles can pass through cell membranes via passive endocytosis or by active\npenetration to reach a target cellular compartment or organelle. In this\nmanuscript, we develop a simple model to describe the interaction of a\nself-driven spherical particle (moving through an effective constant active\nforce) with a minimal membrane system, allowing for both penetration and\ntrapping. We numerically calculate the state diagram of this system, the\nmembrane shape, and its dynamics. In this context, we show that the active\nparticle may either get trapped near the membrane or penetrates through it,\nwhere the membrane can either be permanently destroyed or recover its initial\nshape by self-healing. Additionally, we systematically derive a continuum\ndescription allowing to accurately predict most of our results analytically.\nThis analytical theory helps identifying the generic aspects of our model,\nsuggesting that most of its ingredients should apply to a broad range of\nmembranes, from simple model systems composed of magnetic microparticles to\nlipid bilayers. Our results might be useful to predict mechanical properties of\nsynthetic minimal membranes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 15:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

The performance of these microchannels is governed by the\nload bearing capacity indicating the maximum amount of load that the device can\nwithstand. While significant research efforts are aimed towards the coupling of\nelectrokinetics with substrate deformability, the corresponding enhancement in\nthe performances still remains elusive. Towards this, employing an intricate\ncoupling between substrate compliance, hydrodynamic, and electrokinetic\nmodulations, we have analyzed the possible sources of alterations in the flow\nphysics in a deformable microchannel under the rheological premises of\nviscoelastic fluids which have a close resemblance with biological fluids\ntypically used in several bio and micro-fluidic applications. The present study\nreveals that by operating under favorable regimes of parameters like the\nconcentration and molecular weight of the polymer, the quality of the Newtonian\nsolvent, and the concentration of electrolyte, one can achieve substantial\naugmentation in the load carrying capacity of a deformable microchannel for\nviscoelastic fluids as compared to its Newtonian counterpart.

This paper\npresents a novel generative adversarial network based approach to address the\nissues in a coupled manner. It separately models the constraints for the\nintrinsic subject-specific characteristics and the age-specific facial changes\nwith respect to the elapsed time, ensuring that the generated faces present\ndesired aging effects while simultaneously keeping personalized properties\nstable. To ensure photo-realistic facial details, high-level age-specific\nfeatures conveyed by the synthesized face are estimated by a pyramidal\nadversarial discriminator at multiple scales, which simulates the aging effects\nwith finer details. Further, an adversarial learning scheme is introduced to\nsimultaneously train a single generator and multiple parallel discriminators,\nresulting in smooth continuous face aging sequences. The proposed method is\napplicable even in the presence of variations in pose, expression, makeup,\netc., achieving remarkably vivid aging effects. Quantitative evaluations by a\nCOTS face recognition system demonstrate that the target age distributions are\naccurately recovered, and 99.88% and 99.98% age progressed faces can be\ncorrectly verified at 0.001% FAR after age transformations of approximately 28\nand 23 years elapsed time on the MORPH and CACD databases, respectively. Both\nvisual and quantitative assessments show that the approach advances the\nstate-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 05:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

Accordingly, subsequent SM activities tend\nto reinforce/weaken each other, generating a coherent coordination between the\nSM activities and the input temporal stimulus.
