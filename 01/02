Existing cross-platform\nrecommendation approaches assume all cross-platform information to be\nconsistent with each other and can be aligned. However, there remain two\nunsolved challenges: i) there exist inconsistencies in cross-platform\nassociation due to platform-specific disparity, and ii) data from distinct\nplatforms may have different semantic granularities. In this paper, we propose\na cross-platform association model for cross-platform video recommendation,\ni.e., Disparity-preserved Deep Cross-platform Association (DCA), taking\nplatform-specific disparity and granularity difference into consideration. The\nproposed DCA model employs a partially-connected multi-modal autoencoder, which\nis capable of explicitly capturing platform-specific information, as well as\nutilizing nonlinear mapping functions to handle granularity differences. We\nthen present a cross-platform video recommendation approach based on the\nproposed DCA model. Extensive experiments for our cross-platform recommendation\nframework on real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed DCA model\nsignificantly outperform existing cross-platform recommendation methods in\nterms of various evaluation metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jan 2019 16:00:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 09:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

As a result, a type of management service,\ncalled Network Traffic Classifier (NTC), has been introduced. One type of NTCs\nthat has gained huge attention in recent years applies deep learning on packets\nin order to classify flows. Internet is an imbalanced environment i.e., some\nclasses of applications are a lot more populated than others e.g., HTTP.\nAdditionally, one of the challenges in deep learning methods is that they do\nnot perform well in imbalanced environments in terms of evaluation metrics such\nas precision, recall, and $\\mathrm{F_1}$ measure. In order to solve this\nproblem, we recommend the use of augmentation methods to balance the dataset.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation approach based on the use\nof Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks for generating traffic flow patterns\nand Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for replicating the numerical features of\neach class. First, we use the LSTM network in order to learn and generate the\nsequence of packets in a flow for classes with less population. Then, we\ncomplete the features of the sequence with generating random values based on\nthe distribution of a certain feature, which will be estimated using KDE.\nFinally, we compare the training of a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network\n(CRNN) in large-scale imbalanced, sampled, and augmented datasets. The\ncontribution of our augmentation scheme is then evaluated on all of the\ndatasets through measurements of precision, recall, and F1 measure for every\nclass of application. The results demonstrate that our scheme is well suited\nfor network traffic flow datasets and improves the performance of deep learning\nalgorithms when it comes to above-mentioned metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jan 2019 20:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-03"}

These stars are\nassumed to form in binary systems when their expanding hydrogenic envelopes are\npromptly lost just after helium ignition. Significant differences are found\nwith single star evolution, chiefly because the helium core loses mass during\nhelium burning rather than gaining it from hydrogen shell burning. Consequently\npresupernova stars for a given initial mass function have considerably smaller\nmass when they die and will be easier to explode. Even accounting for this\ndifference, the helium stars with mass loss develop more centrally condensed\ncores that should explode more easily than their single-star counterparts. The\nproduction of low mass black holes may be diminished. Helium stars with initial\nmasses below 3.2 Msun experience significant radius expansion after helium\ndepletion, reaching blue supergiant proportions.

This is done through a semiclassical self-consistent procedure, by\nsolving the system of non-linear coupled equations describing the dynamics of\nthe background field and the vacuum polarization. The black hole at its own\nhorizon generates an indefinitely high temperature which decreases to the\nHawking temperature at infinity. Due to the high temperature in its vicinity,\nthere forms a bubble around the black hole in which the scalar field can only\nassume a value equal to zero, a minimum of energy. Thus, in this region the\nsymmetry of the energy and the field is preserved. At the bubble radius, there\nis a phase transition in the value of the scalar field due to a spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking mechanism. Indeed, outside the bubble radius the temperature\nis low enough such that the scalar field settles with a nonzero value in a new\nenergy minimum, indicating a breaking of the symmetry in this outer region.\nConversely, there is symmetry restoration from the outer region to the inner\nbubble close to the horizon. Specific properties that emerge from different\nblack hole electric charges are also noteworthy. It is found that colder black\nholes, i.e., more charged ones, have a smaller bubble length of restored\nsymmetry. In the extremal case the bubble has zero length, i.e., there is no\nbubble. Additionally, for colder black holes, it becomes harder to excite the\nquantum field modes, so the vacuum polarization has smaller values. In the\nextremal case, the black hole temperature is zero and the vacuum polarization\nis never excited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jan 2019 22:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

This study presents a\nframework of multitask learning deep neural networks (MTLDNNs) for this\nquestion, and demonstrates that MTLDNNs are more generic than the traditional\nnested logit (NL) method, due to its capacity of automatic feature learning and\nsoft constraints. About 1,500 MTLDNN models are designed and applied to the\nsurvey data that was collected in Singapore and focused on the RP of four\ncurrent travel modes and the SP with autonomous vehicles (AV) as the one new\ntravel mode in addition to those in RP. We found that MTLDNNs consistently\noutperform six benchmark models and particularly the classical NL models by\nabout 5% prediction accuracy in both RP and SP datasets. This performance\nimprovement can be mainly attributed to the soft constraints specific to\nMTLDNNs, including its innovative architectural design and regularization\nmethods, but not much to the generic capacity of automatic feature learning\nendowed by a standard feedforward DNN architecture. Besides prediction, MTLDNNs\nare also interpretable. The empirical results show that AV is mainly the\nsubstitute of driving and AV alternative-specific variables are more important\nthan the socio-economic variables in determining AV adoption. Overall, this\nstudy introduces a new MTLDNN framework to combine RP and SP, and demonstrates\nits theoretical flexibility and empirical power for prediction and\ninterpretation. Future studies can design new MTLDNN architectures to reflect\nthe speciality of RP and SP and extend this work to other behavioral analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 01:02:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 22:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

To overcome this problem, Kohlweiss and\nMiers (PoPET 2015) introduced the notion of accountable tracing signatures\n(ATS) - an enhanced group signature variant in which the opening authority is\nkept accountable for his actions.

Highly efficient and accurate methods for evaluating molecular\nintegrals are therefore all the more vital in order to perform the calculations\nnecessary for large systems.

Based on the high-order gas evolution\nmodel in GKS, both the interface flux function and conservative flow variables\ncan be evaluated explicitly from the time-accurate gas distribution function.\nAs a result, inside each control volume both the cell-averaged flow variables\nand their cell-averaged gradients can be updated within each time step. The\nflow variable update and slope update are coming from the same physical\nsolution at the cell interface. Different from many other approaches, such as\nHWENO, there are no additional governing equations in GKS for the slopes or\nequivalent degrees of freedom independently inside each cell. For nonlinear gas\ndynamic evolution, the above compact linear reconstruction from the symmetric\nstencil can be divided into sub-stencils and apply a biased nonlinear WENO-Z\nreconstruction. In GKS, the time evolution solution of the gas distribution\nfunction at a cell interface covers a physical process from an initial\nnon-equilibrium state to a final equilibrium one. The GKS evolution models\nunifies the nonlinear and linear reconstructions in gas evolution process for\nthe determination of a time-dependent gas distribution function. This\ndynamically adaptive model helps to solve a long lasting problem in the\ndevelopment of high-order schemes about the choices of the linear and nonlinear\nreconstructions.

We implement a numerical simulation that is based on the recently\ndeveloped unconstrained tree tensor network (TTN) ansatz, which systematically\nimproves the accuracy over the conventional methods as it exploits the internal\ngauge selections. At the highly frustrated region ($J_2=J_1$), we observe a\nsecond order phase transition from plaquette-VBS state to paramagnet phase at\nthe critical magnetic field, $\\Gamma_{c}=0.28$, with the associated critical\nexponents $\\nu=1$ and $\\gamma\\simeq0.4$, which are obtained within the finite\nsize scaling analysis on different lattice sizes $N=4\\times 4, 6\\times 6,\n8\\times8$. The stability of plaquette-VBS phase at low magnetic fields is\nexamined by spin-spin correlation function, which verifies the presence of\nplaquette-VBS at $J_2=J_1$ and rules out the existence of a N\\'{e}el phase. In\naddition, our numerical results suggest that the transition from N\\'{e}el (for\n$J_2<J_1$) to plaquette-VBS phase is a deconfined phase transition. Moreover,\nwe introduce a mapping, which renders the low-energy effective theory of TFI on\nCL to be the same model on $J_1-J_2$ square lattice (SL). We show that the\nplaquette-VBS phase of the highly frustrated point $J_2=J_1$ on CL is mapped to\nthe emergent string-VBS phase on SL at $J_2=0.5J_1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 06:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

We continue this research by\nreporting on numerical simulations, based on the level set method, of a\ngeneralised Hele-Shaw model for which the geometry of the Hele-Shaw cell is\naltered. First, we investigate how imposing constant and time-dependent\ninjection rates in a Hele-Shaw cell that is either standard, tapered or\nrotating can be used to reduce the development of viscous fingering when an\ninviscid fluid is injected into a viscous fluid over a finite time period. We\nperform a series of numerical experiments comparing the effectiveness of each\nstrategy to determine how these non-standard Hele-Shaw configurations influence\nthe morphological features of the inviscid-viscous fluid interface. Tapering\nplates in either converging or diverging directions leads to reduced metrics of\nviscous fingering at the final time when compared to the standard parallel\nconfiguration, especially with carefully chosen injection rates; for the\nrotating plate case, the effect is even more dramatic, with sufficiently large\nrotation rates completely stabilising the interface. Next, we illustrate how\nthe number of non-splitting fingers can be controlled by injecting the inviscid\nfluid at a time-dependent rate while increasing the gap between the plates.\nSimulations compare well with previous experimental results for various\ninjection rates and geometric configurations. Further, we demonstrate how the\nfully nonlinear dynamics of the problem affect the number of fingers that\nemerge and how well this number agrees with predictions from linear stability\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 08:02:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2019 00:40:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 12 May 2019 08:45:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2019 23:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

In the process, a coordinate transform, the symmetrization transform,\nis required to undo the distortion. The transform may be determined by image\nregistration (i.e. alignment) with symmetry constraints imposed in the\nregistration target and in the iterative parameter tuning, which we call\nsymmetry-guided registration. An example use case of image symmetrization is\nfound in electronic band structure mapping by multidimensional photoemission\nspectroscopy, which employs a 3D time-of-flight detector to measure electrons\nsorted into the momentum ($k_x$, $k_y$) and energy ($E$) coordinates. In\nreality, imperfect instrument design, sample geometry and experimental settings\ncause distortion of the photoelectron trajectories and, therefore, the symmetry\nin the measured band structure, which hinders the full understanding and use of\nthe volumetric datasets. We demonstrate that symmetry-guided registration can\ncorrect the symmetry distortion in the momentum-resolved photoemission\npatterns. Using proposed symmetry metrics, we show quantitatively that the\niterative approach to symmetrization outperforms its non-iterative counterpart\nin the restored symmetry of the outcome while preserving the average shape of\nthe photoemission pattern. Our approach is generalizable to distortion\ncorrections in different types of symmetries and should also find applications\nin other experimental methods that produce images with similar features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 10:36:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 2019 22:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

The\nreceiver has perfect knowledge of the channel coefficients, while the\ntransmitter only knows first- and second-order channel statistics. With a\nzero-forcing~(ZF) detector implemented at the receiver side, we design and\nderive closed-form expressions of the optimal precoders at the transmitter that\nminimizes the average SEP over channel statistics for various modulation\nschemes. We then unveil some nice structures on the resulting minimum average\nSEP expressions, which naturally motivate us to explore the use of two useful\nmathematical tools to systematically study their asymptotic behaviors. The\nfirst tool is the Szeg\\\"o's theorem on large Hermitian Toeplitz matrices and\nthe second tool is the well-known limit: $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}(1+1/x)^x=e$. The\napplication of these two tools enables us to attain very simple expressions of\nthe SEP limits as the number of the transmitter antennas goes to infinity. A\nmajor advantage of our asymptotic analysis is that the asymptotic SEP converges\nto the true SEP when the number of antennas is moderately large. As such, the\nobtained expressions can serve as effective SEP approximations for massive MIMO\nsystems even when the number of antennas is not very large. For the widely used\nexponential correlation model, we derive closed-form expressions for the SEP\nlimits of both optimally precoded and uniformly precoded systems. Extensive\nsimulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our asymptotic\nanalysis and compare the performance limit of optimally precoded and uniformly\nprecoded systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 10:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-03"}

However concrete statements in the literature are often invoked in\nvery specific settings (simplified or overly conservative assumptions) or miss\nimportant but subtle points (e.g. it is common to heuristically apply Taylor's\nexpansion globally without referring to compactness). The contribution of this\npaper is twofold (a) we demonstrate that, when the bandwidth is an arbitrary\ninvertible matrix going to zero, it is necessary to keep a certain balance\nbetween the \\emph{kernel decay} and \\emph{magnitudes of bandwidth eigenvalues};\nin fact, without the sufficient decay the estimates may not be even bounded (b)\nwe give a rigorous derivation of bounds with explicit constants for the bias,\nunder possibly minimal assumptions. This connects the kernel decay, bandwidth\nnorm, bandwidth determinant and density smoothness. It has been folklore that\nthe issue with Taylor's formula can be fixed with more complicated assumptions\non the density (for example p. 95 of \"Kernel Smoothing\" by Wand and Jones); we\nshow that this is actually not necessary and can be handled by the kernel decay\nalone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 12:09:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-03"}

In heterogeneous areas such as volcanoes, the\nmultiple scattering contribution limits the imaging-depth to one scattering\nmean free path, the mean distance between two successive scattering events for\nbody waves. In this Letter, we propose a matrix approach of passive seismic\nimaging that pushes back this fundamental limit by making an efficient use of\nscattered body waves drowned into a noisy seismic coda. As a proof-of-concept,\nthe case of the Erebus volcano in Antarctica is considered. The Green's\nfunctions between a set of geophones placed on top of the volcano are first\nretrieved by the cross-correlation of coda waves induced by multiple icequakes.\nThis set of impulse responses forms a reflection matrix. By combining a matrix\ndiscrimination of singly-scattered waves with iterative time reversal, we are\nable to push back the multiple scattering limit beyond 10 scattering mean free\npaths. The matrix approach reveals the internal structure of the Erebus\nvolcano: A chimney-shaped structure at shallow depths, a magma reservoir at\n2500 m and several cavities at sea level and below it. The matrix approach\npaves the way towards a greatly improved monitoring of volcanic structures at\ndepth. Beyond this specific case, the matrix approach of seismic imaging can\ngenerally be applied to all scales and areas where multiple scattering events\nundergone by body waves prevent in-depth imaging of the Earth's crust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 12:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-03"}

Recent microfluidic technologies offer suitable\nplatforms for automating dilutions on-chip, and typically on a digital\nmicrofluidic biochip (DMFB), a sequence of (1:1) mix-split operations is\nperformed on fluid droplets to achieve the target concentration factor (CF) of\na sample. An (1:1) mixing model ideally comprises mixing of two unit-volume\ndroplets followed by a (balanced) splitting into two unit-volume\ndaughter-droplets. However, a major source of error in fluidic operations is\ndue to unbalanced splitting, where two unequal-volume droplets are produced\nfollowing a split. Such volumetric split-errors occurring in different\nmix-split steps of the reaction path often cause a significant drift in the\ntarget-CF of the sample, the precision of which cannot be compromised in\nlife-critical assays. In order to circumvent this problem, several\nerror-recovery or error-tolerant techniques have been proposed recently for\nDMFBs. Unfortunately, the impact of such fluidic errors on a target-CF and the\ndynamics of their behavior have not yet been rigorously analyzed. In this work,\nwe investigate the effect of multiple volumetric split-errors on various\ntarget-CFs during sample preparation. We also perform a detailed analysis of\nthe worst-case scenario, i.e., the condition when the error in a target-CF is\nmaximized.

The method is based on a combination of\nfeatures from network comparison and spectral analysis as well as local\nstatistics, yielding 140 main features.

The values of times delay strongly depend on geometrical sizes of\npotential wells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 15:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-03"}

Such reconnection processes can be induced by the 3D\ndynamics of nonlinear ballooning instability. In this work, we explore the\nglobal 3D geometry of the reconnection process induced by ballooning\ninstability in the near-Earth magnetotail by examining the distribution of\nquasi-separatrix layers associated with plasmoid formation in the entire 3D\ndomain of magnetotail configuration, using an algorithm previously developed in\ncontext of solar physics. The 3D distribution of quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs)\nas well as their evolution directly follows the plasmoid formation during the\nnonlinear development of ballooning instability in both time and space. Such a\nclose correlation demonstrates a strong coupling between the ballooning and the\ncorresponding reconnection processes. It further confirms the intrinsic 3D\nnature of the ballooning-induced plasmoid formation and reconnection processes,\nin both geometry and dynamics. In addition, the reconstruction of the 3D QSL\ngeometry may provide an alternative means for identifying the location and\ntiming of 3D reconnection sites in magnetotail from both numerical simulations\nand satellite observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 03:26:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

In this paper for measuring these parameters of zinc oxide\nnanomaterial with two different stabilizers, a simple optical method, Moire\ndeflectometry, which is based on wave front analysis and geometric optics is\nused. In the Moire deflectometry method, the beam of light from the laser diode\npasses through the sample. As a result of that, a change in the sample\nenvironment is observed as deflections of the fringes. By recording of these\ndeflections using CCD and image processing with MATLAB, the nanomaterials\nrefractive indices can be calculated. Due to the high accuracy of this method\nand improved the image processing code in Matlab, the smallest changes of the\nrefractive index in the sample can be measured. Digital Image processing is\nused for processing images in a way that features can be selected and being\nshown. The results obtained in this method show a good improvement over the\nother used methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 14:48:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

It combines deep neural\nnetworks and evolutionary algorithms to improve and/or automate the\nconstruction of neural networks. Recent Neuro-Evolution approaches have shown\npromising results, rivaling hand-crafted neural networks in terms of accuracy.\nA two-step approach is introduced where a convolutional autoencoder is created\nthat efficiently compresses the input data in the first step, and a\nconvolutional neural network is created to classify the compressed data in the\nsecond step. The creation of networks in both steps is guided by by an\nevolutionary process, where new networks are constantly being generated by\nmutating members of a collection of existing networks. Additionally, a method\nis introduced that considers the trade-off between compression and information\nloss of different convolutional autoencoders. This is used to select the\noptimal convolutional autoencoder from among those evolved to compress the data\nfor the second step. The complete framework is implemented, tested on the\npopular CIFAR-10 data set, and the results are discussed. Finally, a number of\npossible directions for future work with this particular framework in mind are\nconsidered, including opportunities to improve its efficiency and its\napplication in particular areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 12:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-05"}
