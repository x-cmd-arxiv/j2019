Here we define the capacity of an architecture by the\nbinary logarithm of the number of functions it can compute, as the synaptic\nweights are varied. The capacity provides an upper bound on the number of bits\nthat can be extracted from the training data and stored in the architecture\nduring learning. We study the capacity of layered, fully-connected,\narchitectures of linear threshold neurons with $L$ layers of size $n_1,n_2,\n\\ldots, n_L$ and show that in essence the capacity is given by a cubic\npolynomial in the layer sizes: $C(n_1,\\ldots, n_L)=\\sum_{k=1}^{L-1}\n\\min(n_1,\\ldots,n_k)n_kn_{k+1}$, where layers that are smaller than all\nprevious layers act as bottlenecks. In proving the main result, we also develop\nnew techniques (multiplexing, enrichment, and stacking) as well as new bounds\non the capacity of finite sets. We use the main result to identify\narchitectures with maximal or minimal capacity under a number of natural\nconstraints. This leads to the notion of structural regularization for deep\narchitectures. While in general, everything else being equal, shallow networks\ncompute more functions than deep networks, the functions computed by deep\nnetworks are more regular and \"interesting\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 16:05:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 21:06:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-29"}

This partially\nresults of the fact that land-surface heterogeneity exists at all spatial\nscales and its variability does not `average' out with decreasing scales. The\nwork here presented uses large-eddy simulations and the concept of dispersive\nfluxes to quantify the effect of surface thermal heterogeneity with scales\n$\\sim$ 1/10th the height of the atmospheric boundary layer and characterized by\nuniform roughness. Such near-canonical cases describe inhomogeneous scalar\ntransport in an otherwise planar homogeneous flow when thermal stratification\nis weak or absent. Results illustrate a regime in which the flow is mostly\ndriven by the surface thermal heterogeneities, in which the contribution of the\ndispersive fluxes can account for more than 40\\% of the total sensible heat\nflux at about 0.1$z_i$, with a value of 5 to 10\\% near the surface, regardless\nof the spatial distribution of the thermal heterogeneities, and with a weak\ndependence on time averaging. Results also illustrate an alternative regime in\nwhich the effect of the surface thermal heterogeneities is quickly blended, and\nthe dispersive fluxes match those obtained over an equivalent thermally\nhomogeneous surface. This character seems to be governed by a new\nnon-dimensional parameter representing the ratio of the large-scale advection\neffects to the convective turbulence. We believe that results from this\nresearch are a first step in developing new parameterizations appropriate for\nnon-canonical atmospheric surface layer conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 16:10:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-03"}

In the\ncase of proton removal from 22C, the 19B plus one- and two-neutron channels\nwere consistent with the population of a resonance in 21B 2.47+-0.19 MeV above\nthe two-neutron decay threshold, which is found to exhibit direct two-neutron\ndecay. The ground-state mass excesses determined for 20,21B are found to be in\nagreement with mass surface extrapolations derived within the latest\natomic-mass evaluations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 17:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-03"}

However, existing studies either do not strictly enforce a budget\nconstraint, or are not the `most' cost effective. With a focus on\nclassification problem, we propose a computationally efficient approach that\ncould find a near optimal model under a given budget by exploring the most\n`promising' part of the solution space. Instead of outputting a single model,\nwe produce a model schedule -- a list of models, sorted by model costs and\nexpected predictive accuracy.

While most of the existing\nwork focuses on generating adversarial perturbations in multi-class\nclassification problems, many real-world applications fall into the multi-label\nsetting in which one instance could be associated with more than one label. For\nexample, a spammer may generate adversarial spams with malicious advertising\nwhile maintaining the other labels such as topic labels unchanged. To analyze\nthe vulnerability and robustness of multi-label learning models, we investigate\nthe generation of multi-label adversarial perturbations. This is a challenging\ntask due to the uncertain number of positive labels associated with one\ninstance, as well as the fact that multiple labels are usually not mutually\nexclusive with each other. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a\ngeneral attacking framework targeting on multi-label classification problem and\nconduct a premier analysis on the perturbations for deep neural networks.\nLeveraging the ranking relationships among labels, we further design a\nranking-based framework to attack multi-label ranking algorithms. We specify\nthe connection between the two proposed frameworks and separately design two\nspecific methods grounded on each of them to generate targeted multi-label\nperturbations. Experiments on real-world multi-label image classification and\nranking problems demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed frameworks and\nprovide insights of the vulnerability of multi-label deep learning models under\ndiverse targeted attacking strategies. Several interesting findings including\nan unpolished defensive strategy, which could potentially enhance the\ninterpretability and robustness of multi-label deep learning models, are\nfurther presented and discussed at the end.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 22:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-04"}

We present an innovative computational\nsystem fed by signals of heartbeat rate, wrist motion and pedometer sensed by a\nsmartwatch.

A SRF is\nadaptive to subjects: its structural parameters are tuned by a differential\nevolution algorithm. SRFs are used in a multilayer architecture, providing\nfurther levels of processing to realize macro analyses in the application\ndomain. As a result, the architecture provides a daily PAL, useful to detect\nbehavioural shift indicating initial signs of disease or deviations in\nperformance.

In particular, ALPR\naims to learn a more flexible and discriminative projection that not only\npreserves the intrinsic structure of data, but also possesses the properties of\nfeature selection and interpretability. To this end, we introduce a target\nlearning technique to adaptively learn a more discriminative and flexible\ntarget matrix rather than the pre-defined strict zero-one label matrix for\nregression. Then a locality preserving constraint regularized by the adaptive\nlearned weights is further introduced to guide the projection learning, which\nis beneficial to learn a more discriminative projection and avoid overfitting.\nMoreover, we replace the conventional `Frobenius norm' with the special l21\nnorm to constrain the projection, which enables the method to adaptively select\nthe most important features from the original high-dimensional data for feature\nextraction. In this way, the negative influence of the redundant features and\nnoises residing in the original data can be greatly eliminated. Besides, the\nproposed method has good interpretability for features owing to the\nrow-sparsity property of the l21 norm. Extensive experiments conducted on the\nsynthetic database with manifold structure and many real-world databases prove\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 00:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-04"}

Historical driving\ndata are fed into a simulation environment where an RL agent learns from trial\nand error interactions based on a reward function that signals how much the\nagent deviates from the empirical data. Through these interactions, an optimal\npolicy, or car-following model that maps in a human-like way from speed,\nrelative speed between a lead and following vehicle, and inter-vehicle spacing\nto acceleration of a following vehicle is finally obtained. The model can be\ncontinuously updated when more data are fed in. Two thousand car-following\nperiods extracted from the 2015 Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study were used\nto train the model and compare its performance with that of traditional and\nrecent data-driven car-following models. As shown by this study results, a deep\ndeterministic policy gradient car-following model that uses disparity between\nsimulated and observed speed as the reward function and considers a reaction\ndelay of 1s, denoted as DDPGvRT, can reproduce human-like car-following\nbehavior with higher accuracy than traditional and recent data-driven\ncar-following models. Specifically, the DDPGvRT model has a spacing validation\nerror of 18% and speed validation error of 5%, which are less than those of\nother models, including the intelligent driver model, models based on locally\nweighted regression, and conventional neural network-based models. Moreover,\nthe DDPGvRT demonstrates good capability of generalization to various driving\nsituations and can adapt to different drivers by continuously learning. This\nstudy demonstrates that reinforcement learning methodology can offer insight\ninto driver behavior and can contribute to the development of human-like\nautonomous driving algorithms and traffic-flow models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 01:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-04"}

Some of these services draw millions of viewers each month. Moreover,\nthis viewership has continued to increase, despite the consistent coupling of\nthis free content with deceptive advertisements and user-hostile tracking.\n  In this paper, we explore the ecosystem of free illegal live streaming\nservices by collecting and examining the behavior of a large corpus of illegal\nsports streaming websites. We explore and quantify evidence of user tracking\nvia third-party HTTP requests, cookies, and fingerprinting techniques on more\nthan $27,303$ unique video streams provided by $467$ unique illegal live\nstreaming domains. We compare the behavior of illegal live streaming services\nwith legitimate services and find that the illegal services go to much greater\nlengths to track users than most legitimate services, and use more obscure\ntracking services. Similarly, we find that moderated sites that aggregate links\nto illegal live streaming content fail to moderate out sites that go to\nsignificant lengths to track users. In addition, we perform several case\nstudies which highlight deceptive behavior and modern techniques used by some\ndomains to avoid detection, monetize traffic, or otherwise exploit their\nviewers.\n  Overall, we find that despite recent improvements in mechanisms for detecting\nmalicious browser extensions, ad-blocking, and browser warnings, users of free\nillegal live streaming services are still exposed to deceptive ads, malicious\nbrowser extensions, scams, and extensive tracking. We conclude with insights\ninto the ecosystem and recommendations for addressing the challenges\nhighlighted by this study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 02:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-04"}

In this method, variable transformations that are\nobtained from the extended symmetry groups of PDEs are used to transform\nindependent and dependent variables, and derivative terms of compact finite\ndifference schemes (constructed for these PDEs) such that the resulting schemes\nare invariant under the chosen symmetry groups. The unknown symmetry parameters\nthat arise from the application of these transformations are determined through\nselection of convenient moving frames. In some cases, owing to selection of\nconvenient moving frames, numerical representation of invariant (or symmetry\npreserving) compact numerical schemes, that are developed through the proposed\nmethod, are found to be notably simpler than that of standard, noninvariant\ncompact numerical schemes. Further, the order of accuracy of these invariant\ncompact schemes can be arbitrarily set to a desired order by considering\nsuitable compact finite difference algorithms. Application of the proposed\nmethod is demonstrated through construction of invariant compact finite\ndifference schemes for some common linear and nonlinear PDEs (including the\nlinear advection-diffusion equation in 1D/2D, the inviscid and viscous Burgers'\nequations in 1D).

To achieve both data\nsecurity and persistence, simply combining existing persistence schemes with\nmemory encryption is inefficient due to crash inconsistency and significant\nperformance degradation. To bridge the gap between security and persistence,\nthis paper proposes SecPM, a Secure and Persistent Memory system, which\nconsists of a counter cache write-through (CWT) scheme and a locality-aware\ncounter write reduction (CWR) scheme. Specifically, SecPM leverages the CWT\nscheme to guarantee the crash consistency via ensuring both the data and its\ncounter are durable before the data flush completes, and leverages the CWR\nscheme to improve the system performance via exploiting the spatial locality of\ncounter storage, log and data writes. We have implemented SecPM in gem5 with\nNVMain and evaluated it using five widely-used workloads. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that SecPM reduces up to half of write\nrequests and speeds up the transaction execution by 1.3-2.0 times via using the\nCWR scheme, and achieves the performance close to an un-encrypted persistent\nmemory system for large transactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 06:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-04"}

Ice tanks use various types of aqueous model ice types, each of\nwhich contain brine dopants to scale-reduce ice-sheet strength.

Such behavior is attributable to plasticity and\nvertical variations in stiffness and strength through sheets of model ice.\nAdditionally, the problematic formation of a top layer in model ice sheets is\nshown to have a greater impact of sheet behavior than the literature reports\nheretofore.

Some endografts exhibit\na small offset between the radiopaque markers and the proximal fabric edge.\nUnintended partial renal artery coverage may thus occur. This study\ninvestigates the consequences of partial coverage on renal flow patterns and\nwall shear stress. Methods: In-vitro models of an abdominal aortic aneurysm\nwere used to visualize pulsatile flow using 2D particle image velocimetry under\nphysiologic resting conditions. One model served as control and two models were\nstented with an Endurant endograft, one without and one with partial renal\nartery coverage with 1.3 mm of stent fabric extending beyond the marker (16\\%\narea coverage). The magnitude and oscillation of wall shear stress, relative\nresidence time and backflow in the renal artery were analyzed. Results: In both\nstented models, a region along the caudal renal artery wall presented with low\nand oscillating wall shear stress, not present in the control model. A region\nwith very low wall shear stress (<0.1 Pa) was present in the model with partial\ncoverage over a length of 7 mm, compared to a length of 2 mm in the model\nwithout renal coverage.

Furthermore in UCoGe, it was found that SC survives in the PM regime\nfrom P_c = 1.1 to 4 GPa. Focus has been on low-temperature experiments under\nextreme conditions of magnetic field (H), pressure, and uniaxial stress. In\nUGe2, strong interplay exists between Fermi surface (FS) reconstructions in the\ncascade of different FM and PM ground states and their magnetic fluctuations.\nSimilar phenomena occur in URhGe and UCoGe but, at first glance, the SC seems\nto be driven by the FM fluctuations. In UCoGe, a longitudinal field scan leads\nto a drastic decrease in the FM fluctuations, while a transverse field scan\nleads to suppression of the Curie temperature, T_Curie; the consequence is a\nboost in FM fluctuations, leading to a reinforcement of SC. The singularity in\nURhGe is the weakness of the anisotropy between c- and b-axes; the most\nnoteworthy feature is the detection of reentrant SC near H_R.

Furthermore, conditional GANs\nallow us to control the image generation process through labels or even natural\nlanguage descriptions. However, fine-grained control of the image layout, i.e.\nwhere in the image specific objects should be located, is still difficult to\nachieve. This is especially true for images that should contain multiple\ndistinct objects at different spatial locations. We introduce a new approach\nwhich allows us to control the location of arbitrarily many objects within an\nimage by adding an object pathway to both the generator and the discriminator.\nOur approach does not need a detailed semantic layout but only bounding boxes\nand the respective labels of the desired objects are needed. The object pathway\nfocuses solely on the individual objects and is iteratively applied at the\nlocations specified by the bounding boxes. The global pathway focuses on the\nimage background and the general image layout. We perform experiments on the\nMulti-MNIST, CLEVR, and the more complex MS-COCO data set. Our experiments show\nthat through the use of the object pathway we can control object locations\nwithin images and can model complex scenes with multiple objects at various\nlocations. We further show that the object pathway focuses on the individual\nobjects and learns features relevant for these, while the global pathway\nfocuses on global image characteristics and the image background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 11:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-04"}

As with any qubit implementation, a crucial requirement is the\nability to measure individual quantum states rapidly and with high fidelity. As\nthe signal from a single electron spin is minute, different spin states are\nconverted to different charge states. Charge detection so far mostly relied on\nexternal electrometers, which hinders scaling to two-dimensional spin qubit\narrays. As an alternative, gate-based dispersive read-out based on off-chip\nlumped element resonators were introduced, but here integration times of 0.2 to\n2 ms were required to achieve single-shot read-out. Here we connect an on-chip\nsuperconducting resonant circuit to two of the gates that confine electrons in\na double quantum dot. Measurement of the power transmitted through a feedline\ncoupled to the resonator probes the charge susceptibility, distinguishing\nwhether or not an electron can oscillate between the dots in response to the\nprobe power. With this approach, we achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of\nabout six within an integration time of only 1 $\\mu$s. Using Pauli's exclusion\nprinciple for spin-to-charge conversion, we demonstrate single-shot read-out of\na two-electron spin state with an average fidelity of $>$98% in 6 $\\mu$s. This\nresult may form the basis of frequency multiplexed read-out in dense spin qubit\nsystems without external electrometers, therefore simplifying the system\narchitecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 11:19:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

We discuss its\napplicability to N-body simulations of secularly evolving barred galaxies. In\nthese simulations, we observe consecutive `incidents' of spiral activity,\nleading to a time-varying disc morphology. Besides disc self-excitations, we\nprovide evidence of a newly noted excitation mechanism related to the\n`off-centering' effect: particles ejected in elongated orbits at major\nincidents cause the disc center-of-mass to recoil and be set in a wobble-type\norbit with respect to the halo center of mass. The time-dependent m=1\nperturbation on the disc by the above mechanism correlates with the excitation\nof new incidents of non-axisymmetric activity beyond the bar. At every new\nexcitation, the manifolds act as dynamical avenues attracting particles which\nare directed far from corotation along chaotic orbits.

Here, we\nexplore the use of a trust-graph of identities, with edges representing trust\namong identity owners, to allow a community to grow indefinitely without\nincreasing its sybil penetration. Since identities are admitted to the digital\ncommunity based on their trust by existing digital community members, corrupt\nidentities, which may trust sybils, also pose a threat to the digital\ncommunity. Sybils and their corrupt perpetrators are together referred to as\nbyzantines, and the overarching aim is to limit their penetration into a\ndigital community. We propose two alternative tools to achieve this goal. One\nis graph conductance, which works under the assumption that honest people are\naverse to corrupt ones and tend to distrust them. The second is vertex\nexpansion, which relies on the assumption that there are not too many corrupt\nidentities in the community. Of particular interest is keeping the fraction of\nbyzantines below one third, as it would allow the use of Byzantine Agreement\n[15] for consensus as well as for sybil-resilient social choice [19].

Meanwhile, an array\nof new statistical methods are recently developed for dynamic network analysis.\nHowever, these advanced methods have not been utilized for analyzing such\nmassive dynamic cross-country trading data. International trade data can be\nviewed as a dynamic transport network because it emphasizes the amount of goods\nmoving across a network. Most literature on dynamic network analysis\nconcentrates on the connectivity network that focuses on link formation or\ndeformation rather than the transport moving across the network. We take a\ndifferent perspective from the pervasive node-and-edge level modeling: the\ndynamic transport network is modeled as a time series of relational matrices.\nWe adopt a matrix factor model of \\cite{wang2018factor}, with a specific\ninterpretation for the dynamic transport network. Under the model, the observed\nsurface network is assumed to be driven by a latent dynamic transport network\nwith lower dimensions. The proposed method is able to unveil the latent dynamic\nstructure and achieve the objective of dimension reduction.

This has led\nto the suggestion that a thick disc is not necessary to explain the\ncharacteristics of the MW bulge. We rediscuss this issue by analyzing two\ndissipationless N-body simulations of boxy/peanut (b/p)-shaped bulges formed\nfrom composite stellar discs, made of kinematically cold and hot stellar\npopulations, and we conclude that initial vertical random motions are as\nimportant as in-plane random motions in determining the relative contribution\nof cold and hot disc populations with height above the plane, the metallicity\nand age trends. Previous statements emphasizing the dominant role of in-plane\nmotions in determining these trends are not confirmed. However, differences\nexist in the morphology and strength of the resulting b/p-shaped bulges: a\nmodel where disc populations have initially only different in-plane random\nmotions, but similar thickness, results into a b/p bulge where all populations\nhave a similar peanut shape, independently on their initial kinematics, or\nmetallicity. We discuss the reasons behind these differences, and also predict\nthe signatures that these two extreme initial conditions would leave on the\nvertical age and metallicity gradients of disc stars, outside the bulge region.\nWe conclude that a metal-poor, kinematically (radial and vertical) hot\ncomponent, that is a thick disc, is necessary in the MW before bar formation,\nsupporting the scenario traced in previous works.

In\nparallel, the field of empirical aesthetics aims to understand why people like\nsome designs more than others.

It is worth\nmentioning although SDS as a harsh surfactant, which is a special case, was\nexpected to be present in the surface of the droplet, it penetrated into the\nlipids. Our results showed remarkable entrapped water beads inside the droplet\nin the form of one or more cavities along the internal layer of the head groups\nwhich was surrounded by lipid head groups. It was also reported that in the\nbuilding structure of the nanoemulsion and SLN, in the central parts of the\ndroplets, lipids were denser than the case of NLCs. Our results indicated that,\nin the case of NLC simulations, the lipid distribution within the lipid matrix\nwas insensitive to the mass fraction of solid to liquid lipids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 15:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

Aims: Our goal is to\ncompute turbulent viscosity and magnetic diffusivity, relevant for diffusing\nlarge-scale flows and magnetic fields, respectively, and their ratio, the\nturbulent magnetic Prandtl number, ${\\rm Pm}_{\\rm t}$, for isotropically forced\nhomogeneous turbulence. Methods: We use simulations of forced turbulence in\nfully periodic cubes composed of isothermal gas with an imposed large-scale\nsinusoidal shear flow. Turbulent viscosity is computed either from the\nresulting Reynolds stress or from the decay rate of the large-scale flow.\nTurbulent magnetic diffusivity is computed using the test-field method. The\nscale dependence of the coefficients is studied by varying the wavenumber of\nthe imposed sinusoidal shear and test fields. Results: We find that turbulent\nviscosity and magnetic diffusivity are in general of the same order of\nmagnitude. Furthermore, the turbulent viscosity depends on the fluid Reynolds\nnumber (${\\rm Re}$) and scale separation ratio of turbulence. The scale\ndependence of the turbulent viscosity is found to be well approximated by a\nLorentzian. The results for the turbulent transport coefficients appear to\nconverge at sufficiently high values of ${\\rm Re}$ and the scale separation\nratio. However, a weak decreasing trend is found even at the largest values of\n${\\rm Re}$. The turbulent magnetic Prandtl number converges to a value that is\nslightly below unity for large ${\\rm Re}$ whereas for small ${\\rm Re}$, we find\nvalues between 0.5 and 0.6. Conclusions: The turbulent magnetic diffusivity is\nin general consistently higher than the turbulent viscosity. The actual value\nof ${\\rm Pm}_{\\rm t}$ found from the simulations ($\\approx0.9\\ldots0.95$) at\nlarge ${\\rm Re}$ and scale separation ratio is higher than any of the analytic\npredictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 15:18:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 17:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

Interpreting XANES spectra is a key step towards understanding\nthe structural and electronic properties of materials, and as such, extracting\nstructural and electronic descriptors from XANES spectra is akin to solving a\nchallenging inverse problem.

Given that the model\nwith 4-fermion interactions is nonrenormalizable in the traditional sense, the\naim is to gain insight into the divergent integrals without resorting to\nexplicit regularization. We impose a restriction on the linearly divergent\nprimitive integrals, thus resolving the long-standing issue of momentum routing\nambiguity associated with fermion-antifermion condensations. The removal of the\nambiguity paves the way for the possible calculation of the true ratio of Higgs\nboson mass to top quark mass in the top condensation model. In this paper, we\nalso investigate the negative vacuum energy resulted from dynamical symmetry\nbreaking and its cosmological implications. In the framework of modified\nEinstein-Cartan gravity, it is demonstrated that the late-time acceleration is\ndriven by a novel way of embedding the Hubble parameter into the Friedmann\nequation via an interpolation function, whereas the dynamically generated\nnegative cosmological constant only plays a minor role for the current epoch.\nTwo cosmic scenarios are proposed, with one of which suggesting that the\nuniverse may have been evolving from an everlasting coasting state towards the\naccelerating era characterized by the deceleration parameter approaching -0.5\nat low redshift. One inevitable outcome of the modified Friedmannian cosmology\nis that the directly measured local Hubble parameter should in general be\nlarger than the Hubble parameter calibrated from the conventional Friedmann\nequation. This Hubble tension becomes more pronounced when the Hubble parameter\nis comparable or less than a characteristic Hubble scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 14:45:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 05:49:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 00:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-18"}

In addition to the monomer-aggregate absorption\npeak shift, which defines the conventional J- and H-aggregates, we incorporate\nthe peak shift associated with increasing temperature as a measure to\ncharacterize the exciton band structure. First we show that there is a\none-to-one correspondence between the monomer-aggregate and the T-dependent\npeak shifts for Kasha's well-established model of 1D aggregates, where\nJ-aggregates exhibit further redshift upon increasing temperature and\nH-aggregates exhibit further blueshift. On the contrary, 2D aggregate\nstructures are capable of supporting the two other combinations: blueshifting\nJ-aggregates and redshifting H-aggregates, owing to their more complex exciton\nband structures. Secondly, using spectral lineshape theory, the T-dependent\nshift is associated with the relative abundance of states on each side of the\nbright state. We further establish that the density of states can be connected\nto the microscopic packing condition leading to these four classes of\naggregates by separately considering the short and long-range contribution to\nthe excitonic couplings. In particular the T-dependent shift is shown to be an\nunambiguous signature for the sign of net short-range couplings: Aggregates\nwith net negative (positive) short-range couplings redshift (blueshift) with\nincreasing temperature. Lastly, comparison with experiments shows that our\ntheory can be utilized to quantitatively account for the observed but\npreviously unexplained T-dependent absorption lineshapes. Thus, our work\nprovides a firm ground for elucidating the structure-function relationships for\nmolecular aggregates and is fully compatible with existing experimental and\ntheoretical structure characterization tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 04:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

This data often\ncontain private and sensitive information about individuals, which can be\ndisclosed by adversaries. An adversary can recognize the underlying\nindividual's identity for a data record by looking at the values of\nquasi-identifier attributes, known as identity disclosure, or can uncover\nsensitive information about an individual through attribute disclosure. In\nStatistical Disclosure Control, multiple disclosure risk measures have been\nproposed. These share two drawbacks: they do not consider identity and\nattribute disclosure concurrently in the risk measure, and they make\nrestrictive assumptions on an adversary's knowledge by assuming certain\nattributes are quasi-identifiers and there is a clear boundary between\nquasi-identifiers and sensitive information. In this paper, we present a novel\ndisclosure risk measure that addresses these limitations, by presenting a\nsingle combined metric of identity and attribute disclosure risk, and providing\nflexibility in modeling adversary's knowledge. We have developed an efficient\nalgorithm for computing the proposed risk measure and evaluated the feasibility\nand performance of our approach on a real-world data set from the domain of\nsocial work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 18:46:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

We report on a completely different stress generation\nmechanism. In contrast with the classical picture where the crystal pushes the\npore wall, the crystal growth leads to the generation of a local tensile\nstress. This tensile stress occurs next to a region where a compressive stress\nis generated, thus inducing also shear stresses. The tensile stress generation\nis attributed to capillary effects in the thin film confined between the\ncrystal and the pore wall. These findings are obtained from direct optical\nobservations in model pores where the tensile stress generation results in the\ncollapse of the pore region located between the crystal and the pore dead-end.\nThe experiments also reveal other interesting phenomena, such as the hyperslow\ndrying in PDMS channels or the asymmetrical growth of the crystal during the\ncollapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 10:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-18"}

In\nthis relation, we make use of text line terminal points which is the current\nstate-of-the-art. The terminal points spotted along both margins (left and\nright) of a document image for every text line are considered as source and\ntarget respectively. The tunneling algorithm uses a single agent (or robot) to\nidentify the coordinate positions in the compressed representation to perform\ntext-line segmentation of the document. The agent starts at a source point and\nprogressively tunnels a path routing in between two adjacent text lines and\nreaches the probable target. The agent's navigation path from source to the\ntarget bypassing obstacles, if any, results in segregating the two adjacent\ntext lines. However, the target point would be known only when the agent\nreaches the destination; this is applicable for all source points and\nhenceforth we could analyze the correspondence between source and target nodes.\nArtificial Intelligence in Expert systems, dynamic programming and greedy\nstrategies are employed for every search space while tunneling. An exhaustive\nexperimentation is carried out on various benchmark datasets including ICDAR13\nand the performances are reported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 05:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-01"}

However the\ndriving materials reaching infrared absorption are generally heavy\nmetalcontaining (Pb and Hg) with a high toxicity. An alternative strategy to\nachieve infrared transition is the use of doped semiconductors presenting\nintraband or plasmonic transition in the short, mid and long-wave infrared.\nThis strategy may offer more flexibility regarding the range of possible\ncandidate materials. In particular, significant progresses have been achieved\nfor the synthesis of doped oxides and for the control of their doping\nmagnitude. Among them, tin doped indium oxide (ITO) is the one providing the\nbroadest spectral tunability. Here we test the potential of such ITO\nnanoparticles for photoconduction in the infrared. We demonstrate that In2O3\nnanoparticles presents an intraband absorption in the mid infrared range which\nis transformed into a plasmonic feature as doping is introduced. We have\ndetermined the cross section associated with the plasmonic transition to be in\nthe 1-3x10-13 cm2 range. We have observed that the nanocrystals can be made\nconductive and photoconductive due to a ligand exchange using a short\ncarboxylic acid, leading to a dark conduction with n-type character. We bring\nfurther evidence that the observed photoresponse in the infrared is the result\nof a bolometric effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 19:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-26"}
