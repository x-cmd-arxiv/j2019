Traditional inverse\nproblem solvers minimize a cost function consisting of a data-fit term, which\nmeasures how well an image matches the observations, and a regularizer, which\nreflects prior knowledge and promotes images with desirable properties like\nsmoothness. Recent advances in machine learning and image processing have\nillustrated that it is often possible to learn a regularizer from training data\nthat can outperform more traditional regularizers. We present an end-to-end,\ndata-driven method of solving inverse problems inspired by the Neumann series,\nwhich we call a Neumann network. Rather than unroll an iterative optimization\nalgorithm, we truncate a Neumann series which directly solves the linear\ninverse problem with a data-driven nonlinear regularizer. The Neumann network\narchitecture outperforms traditional inverse problem solution methods,\nmodel-free deep learning approaches, and state-of-the-art unrolled iterative\nmethods on standard datasets. Finally, when the images belong to a union of\nsubspaces and under appropriate assumptions on the forward model, we prove\nthere exists a Neumann network configuration that well-approximates the optimal\noracle estimator for the inverse problem and demonstrate empirically that the\ntrained Neumann network has the form predicted by theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2019 17:44:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2019 00:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

Discrete quantum walk (DQW), is a powerful quantum\nsimulation scheme, and implementable in well controllable table-top set-ups. We\nfirst identify that the conventional DQW can't exactly simulate Dirac Cellular\nAutomaton (DCA), a discretized theory of free Dirac Hamiltonian (DH). We found\nsome choice of coin parameters of the split-step (SS) DQW, a generalization of\nDQW can fully simulate single-particle DCA. Next we question whether the same\nSS-DQW can simulate dynamics of free Dirac particle with extra degrees of\nfreedom like colors, flavors besides the spin or chirality. One such example is\nNeutrino oscillation. By moving from the U(2) coined SS-DQW to the U(6) coined\nSS-DQW we have simulated the exact probability profile of Neutrino flavor\ntransitions. We further probe towards simulating single particle massive DH in\npresence of background potentials and space-time curvature. By using a SS-DQW\nwith position-time dependent coin parameters, and we realize that it will give\nus an unbounded effective Hamiltonian, at the continuum limit of position-time.\nSo we have introduced a modified version of SS-DQW which will produce a bounded\neffective Hamiltonian. This modified SS-DQW with U(2) coin operations produces\nsingle-particle massive DH in presence of abelian gauge potentials and\nspace-time curvature. Introducing higher dimensional---U(N) coin operations in\nthe modified SS-DQW we can include non-abelian potentials in the same DH. In\norder to simulate two-particle DH in presence of curved space-time and external\npotentials, we have used two particle modified SS-DQW, where the shift\noperations act separately on each particle, the coin operations which act\nsimultaneously on both particles contain all kinds of interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2019 16:37:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

To achieve this\nseparation, we develop a two-branch State Space Variational AutoEncoder (SSVAE)\nmodel to individually describe the instantaneous evoked foreground signals and\nthe context-dependent background signals.

For this purpose, we propose a novel Bayesian\nnonparametric method based on non-stationary spatiotemporal Gaussian process\n(STGP). The classic STGP has a covariance kernel separable in space and time,\nfailed to characterize TESD. More recent works on non-separable STGP treat\nlocation and time together as a joint variable, which is unnecessarily\ninefficient. We generalize STGP (gSTGP) to introduce the time-dependence to the\nspatial kernel by varying its eigenvalues over time in the Mercer's\nrepresentation. The resulting non-stationary non-separable covariance model\nbares a quasi Kronecker sum structure. Finally, a hierarchical Bayesian model\nfor the joint covariance is proposed to allow for full flexibility in learning\nTESD. A simulation study and a longitudinal neuroimaging analysis on\nAlzheimer's patients demonstrate that the proposed methodology is\n(statistically) effective and (computationally) efficient in characterizing\nTESD.

The goal is to do task assignment on servers in a real time manner so\nthat the system becomes stable, which means that the queue lengths do not\ndiverge to infinity in steady state (throughput optimality), and the mean task\ncompletion time is minimized (delay optimality). The fluid model planning,\nMax-Weight, and c-$\\mu$-rule algorithms have theoretical guarantees on\noptimality in some aspects for the affinity problem, but they consider a\ncomplicated queueing structure and either require the task arrival rates, the\nservice rates of tasks on servers, or both. In many cases that are discussed in\nthe introduction section, both task arrival rates and service rates of\ndifferent task types on different servers are unknown. In this work, the Blind\nGB-PANDAS algorithm is proposed which is completely blind to task arrival rates\nand service rates. Blind GB-PANDAS uses an exploration-exploitation approach\nfor load balancing. We prove that Blind GB-PANDAS is throughput optimal under\narbitrary and unknown distributions for service times of different task types\non different servers and unknown task arrival rates. Blind GB-PANDAS desires to\nroute an incoming task to the server with the minimum weighted-workload, but\nsince the service rates are unknown, such routing of incoming tasks is not\nguaranteed which makes the throughput optimality analysis more complicated than\nthe case where service rates are known. Our extensive experimental results\nreveal that Blind GB-PANDAS significantly outperforms existing methods in terms\nof mean task completion time at high loads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2019 19:51:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 01:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-05"}

Shear thickening is known\nto be enhanced by increasing the particles' frictional interactions and also by\nmaking their shape more anisotropic. For shear jamming, however, only the role\nof interparticle friction has been investigated, while the effect of changing\nparticle shape has so far not been studied systematically. To address this we\nhere synthesize smooth silica particles and design the particle surface\nchemistry to generate strong frictional interactions such that dense, aqueous\nsuspensions of spheres exhibit pronounced shear jamming. We then vary particle\naspect ratio from $\\Gamma$=1 (spheres) to $\\Gamma$=11 (slender rods), and\nperform rheological measurements to determine the effect of particle anisotropy\non the onset of shear jamming and its precursor, discontinuous shear\nthickening. Keeping the frictional interactions fixed, we find that increasing\naspect ratio significantly reduces $\\phi_m$, the minimum particle packing\nfraction at which shear jamming can be observed, to values as low $\\phi_m=33\\%$\nfor $\\Gamma$=11. The ability to independently control particle interactions due\nto friction and shape anisotropy yields fundamental insights about the\nthickening and jamming capabilities of suspensions and provides a framework to\nrationally design shear jamming characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2019 20:08:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

We found that not a single algorithm performed best for\nboth liver and liver tumors in the three events. The best liver segmentation\nalgorithm achieved a Dice score of 0.963, whereas, for tumor segmentation, the\nbest algorithms achieved Dices scores of 0.674 (ISBI 2017), 0.702 (MICCAI\n2017), and 0.739 (MICCAI 2018). Retrospectively, we performed additional\nanalysis on liver tumor detection and revealed that not all top-performing\nsegmentation algorithms worked well for tumor detection. The best liver tumor\ndetection method achieved a lesion-wise recall of 0.458 (ISBI 2017), 0.515\n(MICCAI 2017), and 0.554 (MICCAI 2018), indicating the need for further\nresearch.

Starting from full base station (BS)\ncoordination, we first propose a fully-coordinated scheme to exploit beneficial\neffects of both inter-cell and intra-cell interference, based on sharing both\nchannel state information (CSI) and data among the BSs. To reduce the\ncoordination overhead, we then propose a partially-coordinated scheme where\nonly intra-cell interference is designed to be constructive while inter-cell is\njointly suppressed by the coordinated BSs. Accordingly, the coordination only\ninvolves CSI exchange and the need for sharing data is eliminated. To further\nreduce the coordination overhead, a third scheme is proposed, which only\nrequires the knowledge of statistical inter-cell channels, at the cost of a\nslight increase on the transmission power. For all the proposed schemes,\nimperfect CSI is considered. We minimize the total transmission power in terms\nof probabilistic and deterministic optimizations. Explicitly, the former\nstatistically satisfies the users' signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio\n(SINR) while the latter guarantees the SINR requirements in the worst case CSI\nuncertainties. Simulation verifies that our schemes consume much lower power\ncompared to the existing benchmarks, i.e., coordinated multi-point (CoMP) and\ncoordinated-beamforming (CBF) systems, opening a new dimension on multi-cell\ncoordination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2019 20:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

Newly, it has been shown that\nwhen two different coding patterns responsible for doing separate missions are\nadded together based on the superposition theorem, the mixed coding pattern\nwill perform both missions at the same time. In this paper, via a\nsemi-analytical procedure, we demonstrate that such a theorem is not\nnecessarily valid for all possible functionalities with considering phase-only\ncoding distributions and ignoring the element pattern function. By revisiting\nthe addition theorem, we introduce the concept of asymmetric spatial power\ndivider (ASPD) with arbitrary power ratio levels in which modulating both\namplitude and phase of the meta-atoms is inevitable to fully control the power\nintensity pattern of the metasurface.

A major goal in systematic biology is to infer\nevolutionary relationships, and while phylogenetic trees can be uniquely\ndetermined from various simple combinatorial data on $X$, for networks the\nreconstruction question is much more subtle.

We show that reconstruction\nholds (even within the class of all networks) for a class of networks we call\n`orchard networks', and we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for\nreconstructing any orchard network from its ancestral profile.

However, the presence of only one chain\nimposes a significant overhead in estimating the channel state information\nrequired for beamforming, when conventional digital channel estimation (CE)\napproaches are used. As an alternative, this paper proposes a novel CE\ntechnique, called periodic analog CE (PACE), that can be performed by analog\nhardware. By avoiding digital processing, the estimation overhead is\nsignificantly lowered and does not scale with number of antennas. PACE involves\nperiodic transmission of a sinusoidal reference signal by the transmitter,\nestimation of its amplitude and phase at each receive antenna via analog\nhardware, and using these estimates for beamforming. To enable such non-trivial\noperation, two reference tone recovery techniques and a novel receiver\narchitecture for PACE are proposed and analyzed, both theoretically and via\nsimulations. Results suggest that in sparse, wide-band channels and above a\ncertain signal-to-noise ratio, PACE aided beamforming suffers only a small loss\nin beamforming gain and enjoys a much lower CE overhead, in comparison to\nconventional approaches. Benefits of using PACE aided beamforming during the\ninitial access phase are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2019 22:47:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

Their self-gravitating degree becomes larger when\n$\\Sigma$ is larger or the cooling time is shorter at larger radii. The density\nwaves eventually collapse owing to non-axisymmetric instability, which results\nin either fragmentation or gravito-turbulence after a transient phase.

While prior arts on network embedding focus primarily on\npreserving network topology structure to learn node representations, recently\nproposed attributed network embedding algorithms attempt to integrate rich node\ncontent information with network topological structure for enhancing the\nquality of network embedding. In reality, networks often have sparse content,\nincomplete node attributes, as well as the discrepancy between node attribute\nfeature space and network structure space, which severely deteriorates the\nperformance of existing methods. In this paper, we propose a unified framework\nfor attributed network embedding-attri2vec-that learns node embeddings by\ndiscovering a latent node attribute subspace via a network structure guided\ntransformation performed on the original attribute space. The resultant latent\nsubspace can respect network structure in a more consistent way towards\nlearning high-quality node representations. We formulate an optimization\nproblem which is solved by an efficient stochastic gradient descent algorithm,\nwith linear time complexity to the number of nodes.

To mitigate the burden on IoT devices,\nthe prevailing solution is to offload the CNN inference task, which is usually\ncomposed of billions of operations, to public cloud. However, the\n\"offloading-to-cloud\" solution may cause privacy breach while moving sensitive\ndata to cloud. For privacy protection, the research community has resorted to\nadvanced cryptographic primitives and approximation techniques to support CNN\ninference on encrypted data. Consequently, these attempts cause impractical\ncomputational overhead on IoT devices and degrade the performance of CNNs.\nMoreover, relying on the remote cloud can cause additional network latency and\neven make the system dysfunction when network connection is off.\n  We proposes an extremely lightweight edge device assisted private CNN\ninference solution for IoT devices, namely LEP-CNN.

The decryption of LEP-CNN\nis pre-computed offline via utilizing the linear property of the most\ntime-consuming operations of CNNs.

Here we present the experimental observation of a new kind of\nfrustrated quantum liquid arising in an unlikely place: the magnetic insulator\nBa4Ir3O10 where Ir3O12 trimers form an unfrustrated square lattice.\nExperimentally we find a quantum liquid state persisting down to 0.2 K that is\nstabilized by strong antiferromagnetic interaction with Curie-Weiss temperature\n- 766 K. The astonishing frustration parameter of 3800 is beyond any known\niridate thus far. Heat capacity and thermal conductivity are both linear at low\ntemperatures, a familiar feature in metals but here in an insulator pointing to\nan exotic quantum liquid state. A mere 2% Sr substitution for Ba produces\nlong-range order at 130 K and destroys the linear-T features. Although the\nIr4+(5d5) ions in Ba4Ir3O10 appear to form Ir3O12 trimers of face-sharing IrO6\noctahedra, we propose that intra-trimer exchange is reduced and the lattice\nrecombines into an array of coupled 1D chains with additional spins. An extreme\nlimit of decoupled 1D chains can explain most but not all of the striking\nexperimental observations, indicating that the inter-chain coupling plays an\nimportant role in the novel frustration mechanism leading to this quantum\nliquid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 04:37:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 18:58:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-08"}

Bayesian methods\nhave gained in popularity in the last two decades due to their ability to\nsimultaneously learn the covariance and the graph and characterize uncertainty\nin the selection. For scalability of the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms,\ndecomposability is commonly imposed on the graph space. A wide variety of\ngraphical conjugate priors are proposed jointly on the covariance matrix and\nthe graph with improved algorithms to search along the space of decomposable\ngraphs, rendering the methods extremely popular in the context of multivariate\ndependence modeling. {\\it An open problem} in Bayesian decomposable structure\nlearning is whether the posterior distribution is able to select a meaningful\ndecomposable graph that it is ``close'' in an appropriate sense to the true\nnon-decomposable graph, when the dimension of the variables increases with the\nsample size. In this article, we explore specific conditions on the true\nprecision matrix and the graph which results in an affirmative answer to this\nquestion using a commonly used hyper-inverse Wishart prior on the covariance\nmatrix and a suitable complexity prior on the graph space, both in the\nwell-specified and misspecified settings. In absence of structural sparsity\nassumptions, our strong selection consistency holds in a high dimensional\nsetting where $p = O(n^{\\alpha})$ for $\\alpha < 1/3$. We show when the true\ngraph is non-decomposable, the posterior distribution on the graph concentrates\non a set of graphs that are {\\it minimal triangulations} of the true graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 05:24:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 01:22:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

Two colonels each have a pool of troops that they divide\nsimultaneously among a set of battlefields. The winner of each battlefield is\nthe colonel who puts more troops in it and the overall utility of each colonel\nis the sum of weights of the battlefields that s/he wins. Over the past\ncentury, the Colonel Blotto game has found applications in many different forms\nof competition from advertisements to politics to sports.\n  Two main objectives have been proposed for this game in the literature: (i)\nmaximizing the guaranteed expected payoff, and (ii) maximizing the probability\nof obtaining a minimum payoff $u$. The former corresponds to the conventional\nutility maximization and the latter concerns scenarios such as elections where\nthe candidates' goal is to maximize the probability of getting at least half of\nthe votes (rather than the expected number of votes). In this paper, we\nconsider both of these objectives and show how it is possible to obtain\n(almost) optimal solutions that have few strategies in their support.\n  One of the main technical challenges in obtaining bounded support strategies\nfor the Colonel Blotto game is that the solution space becomes non-convex. This\nprevents us from using convex programming techniques in finding optimal\nstrategies which are essentially the main tools that are used in the\nliterature. However, we show through a set of structural results that the\nsolution space can, interestingly, be partitioned into polynomially many\ndisjoint convex polytopes that can be considered independently. Coupled with a\nnumber of other combinatorial observations, this leads to polynomial time\napproximation schemes for both of the aforementioned objectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 06:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

However, creating\nhigh-quality 360{\\deg} video content can be challenging, as viewers may miss\nimportant events by looking in the wrong direction, or they may see things that\nruin the immersion, such as stitching artifacts and the film crew. We take\nadvantage of the fact that not all directions are equally likely to be\nobserved; most viewers are more likely to see content located at ``true\nnorth'', i.e. in front of them, due to ergonomic constraints. We therefore\npropose 360{\\deg} video direction, where the video is jointly optimized to\norient important events to the front of the viewer and visual clutter behind\nthem, while producing smooth camera motion. Unlike traditional video, viewers\ncan still explore the space as desired, but with the knowledge that the most\nimportant content is likely to be in front of them. Constraints can be user\nguided, either added directly on the equirectangular projection or by recording\n``guidance'' viewing directions while watching the video in a VR headset, or\nautomatically computed, such as via visual saliency or forward motion\ndirection. To accomplish this, we propose a new motion estimation technique\nspecifically designed for 360{\\deg} video which outperforms the commonly used\n5-point algorithm on wide angle video. We additionally formulate the direction\nproblem as an optimization where a novel parametrization of spherical warping\nallows us to correct for some degree of parallax effects.

Deep Logic\nModels create an end-to-end differentiable architecture, where deep learners\nare embedded into a network implementing a continuous relaxation of the logic\nknowledge. The learning process allows to jointly learn the weights of the deep\nlearners and the meta-parameters controlling the high-level reasoning. The\nexperimental results show that the proposed methodology overtakes the\nlimitations of the other approaches that have been proposed to bridge deep\nlearning and reasoning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 09:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

The only available data in TeV range come from the HAWC\nobservations, however outside the solar minimum. The ARGO-YBJ dataset has been\nused to search for sub-TeV/TeV gamma rays from the Sun during the solar minimum\nfrom 2008 to 2010, the same time period covered by the Fermi data. A suitable\nmodel containing the Sun shadow, solar disk emission and inverse-Compton\nemission has been developed, and the chi-square minimization method was used to\nquantitatively estimate the disk gamma-ray signal. The result shows that no\nsignificant gamma-ray signal is detected and upper limits to the gamma-ray flux\nat 0.3$-$7 TeV are set at 95\\% confidence level.

To reveal\nthe mechanism underneath the paradox, we have established a micromechanical\nframework to investigate the deformation mechanism and predict the stiffness\nmatrix of the networked materials. It is revealed that the networked materials\ncan carry in-plane loads by axial stretching/compression of the components in\nthe networks and resist out-of-plane loading by bending and torsion of the\ncomponents. The bending deformation of components has a corresponding relation\nto the axial stretching/compression through the effective thickness, as the\ncontinuum plates do, while the torsion deformation has no relation to the axial\nstretching/compression. The isolated torsion deformation breaks the classical\nstiffness relation between the in-plane stiffness and the out-of-plane\nstiffness, which can even be further distorted by the stiffness threshold\neffect in randomly networked materials. Accordingly, a new formula is\nsummarized to describe the anomalous stiffness relation.

One companion turned out to be a very faint and\nnon-degenerate object, showing a strong variability which is likely the result\nof a strong heating of the stellar side exposed to the pulsar injected flux.\nFinally, one companion is a main-sequence star which shows a strong H{\\alpha}\nemission likely due to a low-level accretion probably from a residual disk.\nThis system can be located in an early evolutive stage, immediately preceding\nthe reactivation of an already re-accelerated pulsar. Furthermore, we\nidentified the companion star to a transient low-mass X-ray binary. Conclusion\nare drawn in the final chapter, where the evolution of millisecond pulsars is\ndiscussed and possible future developments are suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 09:47:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

Stellar winds, supernova explosions and ionization by\nultraviolet photons control the lifetimes of molecular clouds.

High temperatures combined with the ambient\nUV field favour the production or excitation of a few molecular species to the\ndetriment of others, hence leading to specific spectroscopic tracers such as\nrovibrational lines of H2 and rotational lines of CH+.

However, due to the broadband\nproperty of the chaotic signal, it is very difficult for a practical transducer\nor antenna to convert such a broadband signal into a signal that would be\nsuitable for practical band-limited wireless channel. Thus, the use of chaos\nproperty to improve the performance of conventional communication system\nwithout changing the system configuration becomes a critical issue in\ncommunication with chaos. In this paper, chaotic baseband waveform generated by\na chaotic shaping filter is used to show that this difficulty can be overcome.\nThe generated continuous-time chaotic waveform is proven to be topologically\nconjugate to a symbolic sequence, allowing the encoding of arbitrary\ninformation sequence into the chaotic waveform. A finite impulse response\nfilter is used to replace the impulse control in order to encode information\ninto the chaotic signal, simplifying the algorithm for high speed\ncommunication. A wireless communication system is being proposed using the\nchaotic signal as the baseband waveform, which is compatible with the general\nwireless communication platform. The matched filter and decoding method, using\nchaos properties, enhance the communication system performance. The Bit Error\nRate (BER) and computational complexity performances of the proposed wireless\ncommunication system are analyzed and compared with the conventional wireless\nsystems. The results show that the proposed chaotic baseband waveform of our\nwireless communication method has better BER performance in both the static and\ntime-varying wireless channels.

MRO data in polar regions exhibit a correlation between the\ndensity perturbations and the Brunt-V\\\"{a}is\\\"{a}l\\\"{a} frequency, obtained\nfrom Global Climate Modeling. At lower altitude levels (between 100 and\n120~km), although wave saturation might still be dominant, isothermal\nconditions are no longer verified. In this case, theory predicts that the\nintensity of GWs is no more correlated to background temperature, but to static\nstability. At other latitudes in the three aerobraking datasets, the GW-induced\nrelative density perturbations are correlated with neither inverse temperature\nnor static stability; in this particular case, this means that the observed\nactivity of GWs is not only controlled by saturation, but also by the effects\nof GWs sources and wind filtering through critical levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 14:16:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 14:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

We evaluate the advantage of combining\nobservations with MATISSE/VLTI and ALMA to constrain the radial and vertical\nstructure of the dust in the innermost region of circumstellar discs in nearby\nstar-forming regions. Based on a disc model with a parameterized dust density\ndistribution, we apply 3D radiative-transfer simulations to obtain ideal\nintensity maps. These are used to derive the corresponding wavelength-dependent\nvisibilities we would obtain with MATISSE as well as ALMA maps simulated with\nCASA. Within the considered parameter space, we find that constraining the dust\ndensity structure in the innermost $5\\,$au around the central star is\nchallenging with MATISSE alone, whereas ALMA observations with reasonable\nintegration times allow us to derive significant constraints on the disc\nsurface density. However, we find that the estimation of the different disc\nparameters can be considerably improved by combining MATISSE and ALMA\nobservations. For example, combining a 30-minute ALMA observation (at 310 GHz\nwith an angular resolution of 0.03$^{\\prime\\prime}$) for MATISSE observations\nin the L and M bands (with visibility accuracies of about $3\\,\\%$) allows the\nradial density slope and the dust surface density profile to be constrained to\nwithin $\\Delta \\alpha=0.3$ and $\\Delta (\\alpha-\\beta)=0.15$, respectively. For\nan accuracy of ${\\sim 1\\%}$ even the disc flaring can be constrained to within\n$\\Delta \\beta=0.1$. To constrain the scale height to within $5\\,$au, M band\naccuracies of $0.8\\,\\%$ are required.

Recently, as the\nsize of the considered systems has increased, the focus of new methods has been\nshifted towards the high-dimensional domain. In particular, introduction of the\npseudo-likelihood function has pushed the limits of score-based methods which\nwere originally based on the likelihood function.

Apart from\nbeing applicable to high-dimensional problems, methods based on the\npseudo-likelihood and pairwise tests are fundamentally very different. To\ncompare the accuracy of the different types of methods, an extensive numerical\nstudy is performed on data generated by binary pairwise Markov networks. A\nparallelizable Gibbs sampler, based on restricted Boltzmann machines, is\nproposed as a tool to efficiently sample from sparse high-dimensional networks.\nThe results of the study show that pairwise methods can be more accurate than\npseudo-likelihood methods in settings often encountered in high-dimensional\nstructure learning applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 14:26:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2019 07:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-15"}

Then an iterative deep\nlearning approach is used to feed newly predicted and accepted deep learning\nmasks/images (verified by a user) to the training set of the deep learning\nmodel. The error rate in unbiased stereology count of cells on an unseen test\nset reduced from about 3 % to less than 1 % after 5 iterations of the iterative\ndeep learning based unbiased stereology process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 15:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

Recently, Top-$k$ sparsification\ntechniques have been proposed to reduce the volume of data to be exchanged\namong workers. Top-$k$ sparsification can zero-out a significant portion of\ngradients without impacting the model convergence. However, the sparse\ngradients should be transferred with their irregular indices, which makes the\nsparse gradients aggregation difficult. Current methods that use AllGather to\naccumulate the sparse gradients have a communication complexity of $O(kP)$,\nwhere $P$ is the number of workers, which is inefficient on low bandwidth\nnetworks with a large number of workers. We observe that not all top-$k$\ngradients from $P$ workers are needed for the model update, and therefore we\npropose a novel global Top-$k$ (gTop-$k$) sparsification mechanism to address\nthe problem. Specifically, we choose global top-$k$ largest absolute values of\ngradients from $P$ workers, instead of accumulating all local top-$k$ gradients\nto update the model in each iteration. The gradient aggregation method based on\ngTop-$k$ sparsification reduces the communication complexity from $O(kP)$ to\n$O(k\\log P)$. Through extensive experiments on different DNNs, we verify that\ngTop-$k$ S-SGD has nearly consistent convergence performance with S-SGD, and it\nhas only slight degradations on generalization performance. In terms of scaling\nefficiency, we evaluate gTop-$k$ on a cluster with 32 GPU machines which are\ninterconnected with 1 Gbps Ethernet. The experimental results show that our\nmethod achieves $2.7-12\\times$ higher scaling efficiency than S-SGD and\n$1.1-1.7\\times$ improvement than the existing Top-$k$ S-SGD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 15:14:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 04:40:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-18"}

To\nbring such control to the atomic-scale limit, it is important to consider\nphonon polaritons in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Recent studies have pointed\nout that in 2D, splitting between longitudinal and transverse optical (LO and\nTO) phonons is absent at the $\\Gamma$ point, even for polar materials. Does\nthis lack of LO--TO splitting imply the absence of a phonon polariton in polar\nmonolayers? Here, we derive a first-principles expression for the conductivity\nof a polar monolayer specified by the wavevector-dependent LO and TO phonon\ndispersions. In the long-wavelength (local) limit, we find a universal form for\nthe conductivity in terms of the LO phonon frequency at the $\\Gamma$ point, its\nlifetime, and the group velocity of the LO phonon. Our analysis reveals that\nthe phonon polariton of 2D is simply the LO phonon of the 2D system. For the\nspecific example of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we estimate the confinement\nand propagation losses of the LO phonons, finding that high confinement and\nreasonable propagation quality factors coincide in regions which may be\ndifficult to detect with current near-field optical microscopy techniques.\nFinally, we study the interaction of external emitters with two-dimensional hBN\nnanostructures, finding extreme enhancement of spontaneous emission due to\ncoupling with localized 2D phonon polaritons, and the possibility of multi-mode\nstrong and ultra-strong coupling between an external emitter and hBN phonons.\nThis may lead to the design of new hybrid states of electrons and phonons based\non strong coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2019 22:35:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

Delayed treatment of the involved\npatients results in collapse of the femoral head, which leads to a need for\ntotal hip arthroplasty surgery. Core decompression, as the most popular\ntechnique for treatment of the osteonecrosis, includes removal of the lesion\narea by drilling a straight tunnel to the lesion, debriding the dead bone and\nreplacing it with bone substitutes. However, there are two drawbacks for this\ntreatment method. First, due to the rigidity of the instruments currently used\nduring core decompression, lesions cannot be completely removed and/or\nexcessive healthy bone may also be removed with the lesion. Second, the use of\nbone substitutes, despite its biocompatibility and osteoconductivity, may not\nprovide sufficient mechanical strength and support for the bone. To address\nthese shortcomings, a novel robot-assisted curved core decompression (CCD)\ntechnique is introduced to provide surgeons with direct access to the lesions\ncausing minimal damage to the healthy bone. In this study, with the aid of\nfinite element (FE) simulations, we investigate biomechanical performance of\ncore decompression using the curved drilling technique in the presence of\nnormal gait loading. In this regard, we compare the result of the CCD using\nbone substitutes and flexible implants with other conventional core\ndecompression techniques.

EADs are small voltage\nfluctuations that occur during the plateau of an action potential. Although a\nsingle-cell behavior, EADs can lead to tissue-level arrhythmias, including\nventricular tachycardia. Much is currently known about the biophysical\nmechanisms (i.e., the roles of ion channels and intracellular calcium stores)\nfor EADs, due partially to the development and analysis of mathematical models.\nThis includes the application of slow/fast analysis, which takes advantage of\ntimescale separation inherent in the system to simplify its analysis. We take\nthis further, using a minimal 3D model to demonstrate that the phase-2 EADs are\ncanards that are formed in the neighborhood of a folded node singularity. This\nknowledge allows us to determine the number of EADs that can be produced for a\ngiven parameter set without performing computer simulations, and provides\nguidance on parameter changes that can facilitate or inhibit EAD production.\nWith this approach, we demonstrate why periodic stimulation, as would occur in\nan intact heart, preferentially facilitates EAD production when applied at low\nfrequencies,. We also explain the origin of complex alternan dynamics that can\noccur with intermediate-frequency stimulation, in which varying numbers of EADs\nare produced with each stimulation. These revelations fall out naturally from\nan understanding of folded node singularities, but are hard or impossible to\nglean from a knowledge of the biophysical mechanism for EADs alone. Therefore,\nan understanding of the canard mechanism is a useful complement to an\nunderstanding of the biophysical mechanism that has been developed over years\nof experimental and computational investigations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 03:06:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}
