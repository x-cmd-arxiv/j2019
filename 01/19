For TIPS BP1' in room temperature toluene, 1TT formation is rapid and\ncomplete, occurring in 4.4 ps. Decay to the ground state in 100 ns is the\nprimary loss pathway for 1TT in this system. For TIPS BT1', the 1TT is also\nobserved to form rapidly (with a time constant of 5 ps) but in this case it\noccurs in concert with establishment of an excited state equilibrium (K~1) with\nthe singlet exciton state S1 at an energy of 2.3 eV above the ground state.

Applying the proposed techniques to three applications\nincluding image histogram, dense matrix-vector multiplication and sparse\nmatrix-vector multiplications show 1.79x and 2.29x improvements in performance\nand energy consumption, respectively, when both FPGA and GPU execute the\ncorresponding application in parallel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 16:37:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 12:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-28"}

Some classical\noperators are already optimally defined (e.g., the Hilbert transform in\n$L^p(\\mathbb{R})$, $1<p<\\infty$) and others are not (e.g., the Hausdorff-Young\ninequality in $L^p(\\mathbb{T})$, $1<p<2$, or Sobolev's inequality in various\nspaces).

In a\nnumber of practical scenarios, the information from IoT devices in a given\ngeographical area is inherently correlated due to a commonly observed physical\nphenomenon. We introduce a model for massive access that accounts for\ncorrelation both in device activation and in the message content. To this end,\nwe introduce common alarm messages for all devices. A physical phenomenon can\ntrigger an alarm causing a subset of devices to transmit the same message at\nthe same time. We develop a new error probability model that includes false\npositive errors, resulting from decoding a non-transmitted codeword.

As a state-of-the-art\nobject detector, Mask R-CNN adds a branch for predicting segmentation masks on\neach Region of Interest (RoI) to improve the detection performance.

Molecular docking is a task typically performed in silico.\nIt aims at finding the three-dimensional pose of a given molecule when it\ninteracts with the target protein binding site. This task is often done for\nvirtual screening a huge set of molecules to find the most promising ones,\nwhich will be forwarded to the later stages of the drug discovery process.\nGiven the huge complexity of the problem, molecular docking cannot be solved by\nexploring the entire space of the ligand poses.

The nominal orbit for the\nmoon in Kepler-1625 has both of these characteristics, and we calculate that it\nmay only transit roughly 40% of the time.

Our individual galaxy data and stacked\nconstraints point to a strong inverse dependence $\\propto Z^{\\gamma}$ of\ngas-to-dust ratios (G/D) and CO-to-H$_{2}$ conversion factors (aco) on\nmetallicity at z$\\sim$2, with $\\gamma_{\\rm G/D}<$-2.2 and $\\gamma_{\\alpha_{\\rm\nCO}}<$-0.8, respectively. We quantify the importance of comparing G/D and aco\nvs. metallicity trends from the literature on a common, suitably normalised\nmetallicity scale. When accounting for systematic offsets between different\nmetallicity scales, our z$\\sim$2 constraints on these scaling relations are\nconsistent with the corresponding relations for local galaxies. However, among\nthose local relations, we favour those with a steep/double power-law dependence\nof G/D on metallicity. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings\nfor (a) gas mass measurements for sub-M$^{*}$ galaxies, and (b) efforts to\nidentify the characteristic galaxy mass scale contributing most to the comoving\nmolecular gas density at z=2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

The disk faces a uniform flow at Reynolds number Re=133 000\nand can rotate around one of its diameters. It is equipped with instantaneous\npressure measurements to give the aerodynamic loading; moments and centre of\npressure of the front and base sides. When the disk is fixed and aligned,\nsymmetry-breaking vortex shedding is observed and all orientations are visited\nwith equal probability, yielding axisymmetric long-term statistics.\nVery-low-frequency antisymmetric modes as recently observed by Rigas et al.\n(2014) are not observed unless the disk shape is modified into that of a\nbullet, showing the importance of the separation angle. It suggests that these\nmodes are linearly stable for the disk while they are unstable for the bullet\nshape. When the disk is fixed and inclined, the base center of pressure (CoP)\nshifts preferentially towards one side of the rotation axis. Finally, when the\ndisk is free to rotate, the front moment is proportional to the disk\ninclination (aerodynamic stiffness), while the base moment is well correlated\nwith the disk inclination. From these observations, a low-order model is\nderived that couples (i) the CoP, forced stochastically by the turbulent flow,\nand (ii) the disk inclination, as a linear harmonic oscillator forced by the\nbase moment. The model captures well the main statistic and dynamics features\nobserved experimentally. One difference lies in the distribution of the disk\ninclination (which features exponential tails in the measurements but is\nGaussian in the model), suggesting a possible refinement with non-linearities\nor time delays. The model is expected to capture coupled dynamics in other\nsystems involving turbulent wakes behind freely rotating bluff bodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 19:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Absorption spectra are often analyzed\nmanually, an approach that limits reproducibility and which cannot practically\nbe applied to modern datasets consisting of thousands or even millions of\nspectra. Simultaneous probabilistic modeling of absorption features and\ncontinuum shape is a promising approach for automating this analysis. Existing\nimplementations of this approach use numerical methods such as Markov chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) to marginalize over the continuum parameters. Numerical\nmarginalization over large numbers of continuum parameters is too slow to be\nconvenient for exploratory analysis, can increase the dimensionality of an\ninference problem beyond the capacity of simple MCMC samplers, and is in\ngeneral impractical for the analysis of large datasets. When continua are\nparameterized as linear functions such as polynomials or splines, it is\npossible to reduce continuum parameter marginalization to an integral over a\nmultivariate normal distribution, which has a known closed form. In addition to\nspeeding up probabilistic modeling, analytic marginalization makes it trivial\nto marginalize over continuum parameterizations and to combine continuum\ndescription marginalization with optimization for absorption line parameters.\nThese new possibilities allow automatic, probabilistically justified continuum\nplacement in analyses of large spectroscopic datasets. We compare the accuracy\nto within which absorption line parameters can be recovered using different\ncontinuum placement methods and find that marginalization is in many cases an\nimprovement over other methods.

Our framework is very general: it can be trained in similar settings\nto existing approaches, while also supporting weaker supervision.

Comparing\nwith other strategies to reduce the residence time, this approach induced by\nheat is simple and reliable. The reduction in the residence time is due to the\nburst of vapor bubbles in the liquid film, which results in the formation of\nholes in the liquid film and consequently the recoiling of the liquid film from\nthe holes.

Single image super-resolution (SISR), especially\nthat based on deep learning techniques, is an effective and promising\nalternative technique to improve the current spatial resolution of magnetic\nresonance (MR) images. However, the deeper network is more difficult to be\neffectively trained because the information is gradually weakened as the\nnetwork deepens.

However,\nmissing depth information limits available features for a registration to\npreoperative CT data. Therefore, this paper evaluates OCT for enhanced imaging\nof drill holes in mastoid bone and compares OCT data to original endoscopic\nimages.\n  Methods: A catheter-based OCT probe is inserted into a drill trajectory of a\nmastoid phantom in a translation-rotation manner to acquire the inner surface\nstate. The images are undistorted and stitched to create volumentric data of\nthe drill hole.

It always has a\nconsiderable impact on performance, especially in an in-memory database system.\nConventional implementations of logging rely heavily on a centralized design,\nwhich guarantees the correctness of recovery by enforcing a total order of all\noperations such as log sequence number (LSN) allocation, log persistence,\ntransaction committing and recovering. This strict sequential constraint\nseriously limits the scalability and parallelism of transaction logging and\nrecovery, especially in the multi-core hardware environment.\n  In this paper, we define recoverability for transaction logging and\ndemonstrate its correctness for crash recovery. Based on recoverability, we\npropose a recoverable logging scheme named Poplar, which enables scalable and\nparallel log processing by easing the restrictions. Its main advantages are\nthat (1) Poplar enables the parallel log persistence on multiple storage\ndevices; (2) it replaces the centralized LSN allocation by calculating a\npartially ordered sequence number in a distributed manner, which allows log\nrecords to only track RAW and WAW dependencies among transactions; (3) it only\ndemands transactions with RAW dependencies to be committed in serial order; (4)\nPoplar can concurrently restore a consistent database state based on the\npartially constrained logs after a crash. Experimental results show that Poplar\nscales well with the increase of IO devices and outperforms other logging\napproaches on both SSDs and emulated non-volatile memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2019 09:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

The new CPU-GPU\nembedded boards deliver an increased performance but also introduce additional\ncomplexity and challenges. In this work, we address the component-to-hardware\nallocation for CPU-GPU embedded systems. The allocation for such systems is\nmuch complex due to the increased amount of GPU-related information.

The detailed\nCPU-GPU information of the system is abstracted at a high-layer by compacting\nconnected components into single units that behave as regular components.

In order to enhance the qualities of the image, the removal of noises\nbecome imperative and that should not at the cost of any loss of image\ninformation. Noise removal is one of the pre-processing stages of image\nprocessing. In this paper a new method for the enhancement of grayscale images\nis introduced, when images are corrupted by fixed valued impulse noise (salt\nand pepper noise). The proposed methodology ensures a better output for the low\nand medium density of fixed value impulse noise as compared to the other famous\nfilters like Standard Median Filter (SMF), Decision Based Median Filter (DBMF)\nand Modified Decision Based Median Filter (MDBMF) etc. The main objective of\nthe proposed method was to improve peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), visual\nperception and reduction in the blurring of the image. The proposed algorithm\nreplaced the noisy pixel by trimmed mean value. When previous pixel values, 0s,\nand 255s are present in the particular window and all the pixel values are 0s\nand 255s then the remaining noisy pixels are replaced by mean value.

Numerical simulations of a rotating\nhollow cylinder filled with a mixture of heavy balls and powder crushable\nparticles were carried out. Systems with balls of different sizes and/or\nnumbers are compared in terms of the evolution of the powder particle size and\nspecific surface. We find that, in general, the milling process is increasingly\nfaster as the ball size increases. But energy dissipation due to increased\ncollisions between balls slows down the grinding process and makes it\nenergetically less efficient.

The\nstrengthening of the 't Hooft's anomaly matching condition, when the massless\nfermion composites are required to complete a single representation of the\n$SU(N)_{MF}$ rather than some set of its representations, allows to fix the\nnumber of basic metaflavors $N$.

To\nenable high-performance two-way communications of UAVs with their ground\npilots/users, cellular network-connected UAV has drawn significant interests\nrecently. Among others, an important issue is whether the existing cellular\nnetwork, designed mainly for terrestrial users, is also able to effectively\ncover the new UAV users in the three-dimensional (3D) space for both uplink and\ndownlink communications. Such 3D coverage analysis is challenging due to the\nunique air-ground channel characteristics, the resulted interference issue with\nterrestrial communication, and the non-uniform 3D antenna gain pattern of\nground base station (GBS) in practice. Particularly, high-altitude UAV often\npossesses a high probability of line-of-sight (LoS) channels with a large\nnumber of GBSs, while their random binary (LoS/Non-LoS) channel states and\n(on/off) activities give rise to exponentially large number of discrete UAV-GBS\nassociation/interference states, rendering coverage analysis more difficult.\nThis paper presents a new 3D system model to incorporate UAV users and proposes\nan analytical framework to characterize their uplink/downlink 3D coverage\nperformance. To tackle the above exponential complexity, we introduce a\ngeneralized Poisson multinomial (GPM) distribution to model the discrete\ninterference states, and a novel lattice approximation (LA) technique to\napproximate the non-lattice GPM variable and obtain the interference\ndistribution efficiently with high accuracy.

Therefore, efficient sequence\nprocessing techniques are required to explore and predict the periodic\ninformation about the various episodes of drought classes. In this study, we\nproposed a new weighting scheme to predict the probability of various drought\nclasses under Weighted Markov Chain (WMC) model. We provide a standardized\nscheme of weights for ordinal sequences of drought classifications by\nnormalizing squared weighted Cohen Kappa. Illustrations of the proposed scheme\nare given by including temporal ordinal data on drought classes determined by\nthe standardized precipitation temperature index (SPTI). Experimental results\nshow that the proposed weighting scheme for WMC model is sufficiently flexible\nto address actual changes in drought classifications by restructuring the\ntransient behavior of a Markov chain. In summary, this paper proposes a new\nweighting scheme to improve the accuracy of the WMC, specifically in the field\nof hydrology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 20:41:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

To\nincrease the familiarity with this phenomenon we have designed, implemented,\nand tested an interdisciplinary educational activity for pre-collegiate\nstudents in which nuclear engineering and computer science are ancillary to the\ncomprehension of basic physics concepts. Teaching and training experiences are\nperformed by using a 4\" x 4\" NaI(Tl) detector for in-situ and laboratory\n{\\gamma}-ray spectroscopy measurements. Students are asked to directly assemble\nthe experimental setup and to manage the data-taking with a dedicated Android\napp, which exploits a client-server system that is based on the Bluetooth\ncommunication protocol. The acquired {\\gamma}-ray spectra and the experimental\nresults are analyzed using a multiple-platform software environment and they\nare finally shared on an open access Web-GIS service. These all-round\nactivities combining theoretical background, hands-on setup operations, data\nanalysis, and critical synthesis of the results were demonstrated to be\neffective in increasing students' awareness in quantitatively investigating\nenvironmental radioactivity.

This paper\nconsiders such a scenario where a UAV is employed to a malfunction area\n(modeled as a circular disc) in which all ground base stations (BSs) break\ndown. The ground BSs outside the malfunction area are modelled as a homogeneous\nPoisson point process (HPPP). Particularly, a user-centric cooperative scheme\nis proposed to serve the UEs in the malfunction area. According to the user\nequipment's (UE's) connections to the UAV and the nearest ground BS, the\nmalfunction area is divided into three regions, namely the UAV region, the\ncooperation region and the nearest ground BS region, in which the UEs are\nserved by the UAV only, both the UAV and the nearest ground BS, and the nearest\nground BS, respectively. The region size of each type can be adjusted by a\ncooperation parameter $\\delta$. Through rigorous derivations, an expression for\nthe coverage probability achieved by the UE in the malfunction area is\nobtained. In order to provide a fair comparison, the normalized spectral\nefficiency (NSE) which is defined by taking both system throughput and the\nnumber of serving BSs into consideration, is used as a criterion for the\nperformance evaluation. Numerical results are presented to verify the accuracy\nof the analytical results and also to demonstrate the superior performance of\nthe proposed scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2019 07:13:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-07"}

A large amount of this off-chip traffic is used to manipulate\ngraphics framebuffer surfaces. To cut down the cost of accessing off-chip\nmemory, framebuffer surfaces are compressed to reduce the bandwidth consumed on\nsurface manipulation when rendering or displaying.\n  In this work, we study the compression properties of framebuffer surfaces and\nhighlight the fact that surfaces from different applications have different\ncompression characteristics. We use the results of our analysis to propose a\nscheme, Dynamic Color Palettes (DCP), which achieves higher compression rates\nwith UI and 2D surfaces.\n  DCP is a hardware mechanism for exploiting inter-frame coherence in lossless\nsurface compression; it implements a scheme that dynamically constructs color\npalettes, which are then used to efficiently compress framebuffer surfaces. To\nevaluate DCP, we created an extensive set of OpenGL workload traces from 124\nAndroid applications. We found that DCP improves compression rates by 91% for\nUI and 20% for 2D applications compared to previous proposals. We also evaluate\na hybrid scheme that combines DCP with a generic compression scheme.

Limited success has been registered particularly\ndue to the inhomogeneous generation of the thrust, and also the very light\nweight and frail nature of the devices versus the power supply weight needed\nhover the craft [2]. However, EHD propulsion can offer a greater thrust to\npower ratio than any of the current propulsion technologies [3]. Rotary EHD\ndevices have been employed as demo units for a long time [4,5], but it was\nunknown if they could produce enough thrust and vertical lift to lead to device\nliftoff. We designed EHD propellers which spin and eventually lift off and fly\nindependently for a short while. The propeller is balanced on and powered\nthrough a high voltage pin/shaft while an intense electric field is created by\nthe presence of a surrounding ground electrode [6]. Multiple propeller\nelectrode designs and ground counter electrodes are able to support propeller\nrotation and liftoff. Propellers up to 27.8 g and 25.5 cm in diameter were\nstudied with a liftoff voltage range of negative 9.5 kV to 60 kV and rotational\nspeeds up to 80 rot/s. It appears that these are the first EHD devices to\nliftoff and fly on their own without carrying a power supply [7]. This\nvalidates a rotary-based system as a new principle for propulsion with\npotentially improved stability and control characteristics versus the current\nEHD devices. Design optimization and scaling seem possible and EHD drone design\nfeasible. Other applications may include EHD motors, fans, or sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2019 04:29:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}
