Specifically, a decision maker should satisfy\nsome units of an asset as her demand, either form a market with time-varying\nprice or from her own inventory. The decision maker is presented a price in\nslot-by-slot manner, and must immediately decide the purchased amount with the\ncurrent price to cover the demand or to store in inventory for covering the\nfuture demand. The inventory has a limited capacity and its critical role is to\nbuy and store assets at low price and use the stored assets to cover the demand\nat high price. The ultimate goal of the decision maker is to cover the demands\nwhile minimizing the cost of buying assets from the market.

Fabrication of CNC composites typically involves extrusion of CNC\nsuspensions and gels in a variety of solvents, in the presence of additives\nsuch as polymers and curing agents. However, most studies so far have focused\non aqueous CNC gels, yet the behavior of CNC-polymer gels in organic solvents\nis important to their wider processability. Here, we study the rheological\nbehavior of composite polymer-CNC gels in dimethylformamide, which include\nadditives for both UV and thermal crosslinking. Using rheometry coupled with\nin-situ infrared spectroscopy, we show that under external shear, CNC-polymer\ngels display progressive and irreversible failure of the hydrogen bond network\nthat is responsible for their pronounced elastic properties. In the absence of\ncross-linking additives, the polymer-CNC gels show negligible recovery upon\ncessation of flow, while the presence of additives allows the gels to recover\nvia van der Waals interactions. By exploring a broad range of shear history and\nCNC concentrations, we construct master curves for the temporal evolution of\nthe viscoelastic properties of the polymer-CNC gels, illustrating universality\nof the observed dynamics with respect to gel composition and flow conditions.\nWe therefore find that polymer-CNC composite gels display a number of the\ndistinctive features of colloidal glasses and, strikingly, that their response\nto the flow conditions encountered during processing can be tuned by chemical\nadditives.

This familiar process can become increasingly challenging as the\nnumber of unhandled email grows. During a triage session, users commonly defer\nhandling emails that they cannot immediately deal with to later. These deferred\nemails, are often related to tasks that are postponed until the user has more\ntime or the right information to deal with them. In this paper, through\nqualitative interviews and a large-scale log analysis, we study when and what\nenterprise email users tend to defer. We found that users are more likely to\ndefer emails when handling them involves replying, reading carefully, or\nclicking on links and attachments. We also learned that the decision to defer\nemails depends on many factors such as user's workload and the importance of\nthe sender. Our qualitative results suggested that deferring is very common,\nand our quantitative log analysis confirms that 12% of triage sessions and 16%\nof daily active users had at least one deferred email on weekdays. We also\ndiscuss several deferral strategies such as marking emails as unread and\nflagging that are reported by our interviewees, and illustrate how such\npatterns can be also observed in user logs. Inspired by the characteristics of\ndeferred emails and contextual factors involved in deciding if an email should\nbe deferred, we train a classifier for predicting whether a recently triaged\nemail is actually deferred. Our experimental results suggests that deferral can\nbe classified with modest effectiveness. Overall, our work provides novel\ninsights about how users handle their emails and how deferral can be modeled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 16:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

When represented in Fock space, the Hamiltonian of such a\nsystem looks like that of a single particle hopping on a Fock lattice in the\npresence of a random disordered potential. The coordination number of the Fock\nlattice increases linearly with the system size L in 1D. Thus in the\nthermodynamic limit, the disordered interacting problem in 1D maps on to an\nAnderson model with infinite coordination number. Despite this, this system\ndisplays localization which appears counterintuitive. A close observation of\nthe on-site disorders on the Fock lattice reveals a large degree of correlation\namong them as they are derived from an exponentially smaller number of on-site\ndisorders in real space. This indicates that the correlations between the\non-site disorders on a Fock lattice has a strong effect on the localization\nproperties of the corresponding many-body system. In this work we perform a\nsystematic quantitative exploration of the nature of correlations of the Fock\nspace potential required for localization. Without changing the typical\nstrength of the on-site disorders in Fock lattice we show that changing the\ncorrelation strength can induce thermalization or localization in systems. From\namong the various functional forms of correlations we study through exact\ndiagonalization, we find that only the linear variation of correlations with\nHamming distance in Fock space is able to drive a thermal-MBL phase transition\nwhere the transition is driven by the correlation strength. Systems with the\nother forms of correlations we study are found to be ergodic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 16:35:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

In this\ncontext the complex spatial structure evident, e.g., in spiral galaxies is\nunderstood either in terms of instabilities of quasi-stationary states, or a\nresult of dissipative non-gravitational interactions. We illustrate here, using\nnumerical simulations, that purely self-gravitating systems evolving from quite\nsimple initial configurations can in fact give rise easily to structures of\nthis kind of which the lifetime can be large compared to the dynamical\ncharacteristic time, but short compared to the collisional relaxation time\nscale. More specifically, for a broad range of non-spherical and non-uniform\nrotating initial conditions, gravitational relaxation gives rise quite\ngenerically to long-lived non-stationary structures of a rich variety,\ncharacterized by spiral-like arms, bars and even ring-like structures in\nspecial cases. These structures are a feature of the intrinsically\nout-of-equilibrium nature of the system's collapse, associated with a part of\nthe system's mass while the bulk is well virialized. They are characterized by\npredominantly radial motions in their outermost parts, but also incorporate an\nextended flattened region which rotates coherently about a well virialized core\nof triaxial shape with an approximately isotropic velocity dispersion. We\ndiscuss the possible relevance of these simple toy models to the observed\nstructure of real galaxies emphasizing the difference between dissipative and\ndissipationless disc formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 18:40:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

The simplest\nenumerative result identifies a bijection between coalescent histories for a\nmatching caterpillar gene tree and species tree with monotonic paths that do\nnot cross the diagonal of a square lattice, establishing that the associated\nnumber of coalescent histories for $n$-taxon matching caterpillar trees ($n\n\\geqslant 2$) is the Catalan number $C_{n-1} = \\frac{1}{n} {2n-2 \\choose n-1}$.\nHere, we show that a similar bijection applies for \\emph{non-matching}\ncaterpillars, connecting coalescent histories for a non-matching caterpillar\ngene tree and species tree to a class of \\emph{roadblocked} monotonic paths.\nThe result provides a simplified algorithm for enumerating coalescent histories\nin the non-matching caterpillar case. It enables a rapid proof of a known\nresult that given a caterpillar species tree, no non-matching caterpillar gene\ntree has a number of coalescent histories exceeding that of the matching gene\ntree.

The solution for the viscous\nincompressible flow surrounding the membrane is formulated as a mixed boundary\nvalue problem, which is then reduced into a system of dual integral equations\non the inner and outer sides of the domain boundary. We show that the solution\nof the elastohydrodynamic problem can conveniently be expressed in terms of a\nset of inhomogeneous Fredholm integral equations of the second kind with\nlogarithmic kernel.

Accordingly, the system behavior may be shear or\nbending dominated, depending on the geometric and elastic properties of the\nsystem.

This phenomenon\nwas discovered at radio frequencies near 1.4 GHz and to date has been observed\nin one case at as high as 8 GHz, but not below 700 MHz in spite of significant\nsearches at low frequencies. Here we report detections of FRBs at radio\nfrequencies as low as 400 MHz, on the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping\nExperiment (CHIME) using the CHIME/FRB instrument. We present 13 FRBs detected\nduring a telescope pre-commissioning phase, when our sensitivity and\nfield-of-view were not yet at design specifications. Emission in multiple\nevents is seen down to 400 MHz, the lowest radio frequency to which we are\nsensitive. The FRBs show a variety of temporal scattering behaviours, with the\nmajority significantly scattered, and some apparently unscattered to within\nmeasurement uncertainty even at our lowest frequencies. Of the 13 reported\nhere, one event has the lowest dispersion measure yet reported, implying it is\namong the closest yet known, and another has shown multiple repeat bursts, as\ndescribed in a companion paper. Our low-scattering events suggest that efforts\nto detect FRBs at radio frequencies below 400 MHz will eventually be\nsuccessful. The overall scattering properties of our sample suggest that FRBs\nas a class are preferentially located in environments that scatter radio waves\nmore strongly than the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 19:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

As our network\nlearns to acquire data, the network is active in nature. In order to do so, we\nsimultaneously train two neural networks, one dedicated to reconstruction and\nthe other to progressive sampling, each with an automatically generated\nsupervision signal that links them together. The two supervision signals are\ncreated through Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). MCTS returns a better sampling\npattern than what the current sampling network can give and, thus, a better\nfinal reconstruction. The sampling network is trained to mimic the MCTS results\nusing the previous sampling network, thus being enhanced. The reconstruction\nnetwork is trained to give the highest reconstruction quality, given the MCTS\nsampling pattern.

This raises the\nquestion whether separating group varieties via representation theoretic\nmultiplicities is stronger than separating them via occurrences. This paper\nprovides for the first time a setting where separating with multiplicities can\nbe achieved, while the separation with occurrences is provably impossible. Our\nsetting is surprisingly simple and natural: We study the variety of products of\nhomogeneous linear forms (the so-called Chow variety) and the variety of\npolynomials of bounded border Waring rank (i.e. a higher secant variety of the\nVeronese variety). As a side result we prove a slight generalization of\nHermite's reciprocity theorem, which proves Foulkes' conjecture for a new\ninfinite family of cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 21:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

Effect size p fosters productive\ncommunications because researchers understand p = 0.5 is analogous to a fair\ncoin toss, and p near 0 or 1 represents a large effect. This approach is\nfeasible even without background data. Simulations were conducted comparing the\nexact power approach to existing approaches by Rosner & Glynn (2009), Shieh et\nal.

Is\nthere a minimum timescale necessary for development? Can life arise on tidally\nlocked planets? Are convective stars habitable? Variously adopting different\nstances on each of these criteria can alter whether our observed values of the\nfine structure constant, the electron to proton mass ratio, and the strength of\ngravity are typical to high significance. This serves as a way of generating\npredictions for the requirements of life that can be tested with future\nobservations, any of which could falsify the multiverse scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 00:13:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 18:23:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

Although scan-time\noperator screening for whole-slide OOF is feasible, manual screening for OOF\naffecting only parts of a slide is impractical. We developed a convolutional\nneural network (ConvFocus) to exhaustively localize and quantify the severity\nof OOF regions on digitized slides. ConvFocus was developed using our refined\nsemi-synthetic OOF data generation process, and evaluated using real\nwhole-slide images spanning 3 different tissue types and 3 different stain\ntypes that were digitized by two different scanners.

It is often speculated that\nhigh Tc superconductivity arises from a doped Mott insulator as described by\nthe Hubbard model. An exact solution of the Hubbard model, however, is\nextremely challenging due to the strong electron-electron correlation.\nTherefore, it is highly desirable to experimentally study a model Hubbard\nsystem in which the unconventional superconductivity can be continuously tuned\nby varying the Hubbard parameters. Here we report signatures of tunable\nsuperconductivity in ABC-trilayer graphene (TLG) / boron nitride (hBN) moir\\'e\nsuperlattice. Unlike \"magic angle\" twisted bilayer graphene, theoretical\ncalculations show that under a vertical displacement field the ABC-TLG/hBN\nheterostructure features an isolated flat valence miniband associated with a\nHubbard model on a triangular superlattice. Upon applying such a displacement\nfield we find experimentally that the ABC-TLG/hBN superlattice displays Mott\ninsulating states below 20 Kelvin at 1/4 and 1/2 fillings, corresponding to 1\nand 2 holes per unit cell, respectively. Upon further cooling, signatures of\nsuperconducting domes emerge below 1 kelvin for the electron- and hole-doped\nsides of the 1/4 filling Mott state. The electronic behavior in the TLG/hBN\nsuperlattice is expected to depend sensitively on the interplay between the\nelectron-electron interaction and the miniband bandwidth, which can be tuned\ncontinuously with the displacement field D. By simply varying the D field, we\ndemonstrate transitions from the candidate superconductor to Mott insulator and\nmetallic phases. Our study shows that TLG/hBN heterostructures offer an\nattractive model system to explore rich correlated behavior emerging in the\ntunable triangular Hubbard model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 00:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-09"}

This\nleads to an increase in the grain-to-grain contact area (\"neck\") and density of\nthe aggregate over time, resulting in the evolution of its strength, porosity,\nthermal conductivity, and other properties. This process plays an important\nrole in the evolution of icy planetary surfaces, though its rate and nature are\nnot well constrained. In this study, we explore the model of Swinkels and Ashby\n(1981), and assess the extent to which it can be used to quantify sintering\ntimescales for water ice. We compare predicted neck growth rates to new and\nhistorical observations of ice sintering, and find agreement to some studies at\nthe order of magnitude level. First-order estimates of neck growth timescales\non planetary surfaces show that ice may undergo significant modification over\ngeologic timescales, even in the outer solar system. Densification occurs over\nmuch longer timescales, suggesting some surfaces may develop cohesive, but\nporous, crusts. Sintering rates are extremely sensitive to temperature and\ngrain size, occurring faster in warmer aggregates of smaller grains. This\nsuggests that the microstructural evolution of ices may vary not only\nthroughout the solar system, but also spatially across the surface and in the\nnear-surface of a given body. Our experimental observations of complex grain\ngrowth and mass redistribution in ice aggregates point to components of the\nmodel that may benefit from improvement, and areas where additional laboratory\nstudies are needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 01:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

To offset\nthe financial burden placed on the university in light of these mishaps, we\ndesigned a streamlined adaptive control system using set theory. We utilized\nlab-provided plant models to generate an $O_\\infty$ set, attenuated the\nvertices to generate a safe, sub-region $S_\\infty$, and attenuated in such a\nmanner as to ensure an evolution of the vertices of $S_\\infty$ remained within\n$O_\\infty$ for at least one time step.

Combining an estimation procedure with detection procedure is\ncommonly known idea in the literature. However, our contribution lies in\nbuilding the detection procedure based on the difference between the stationary\nestimator and a Stochastic Learning Weak Estimator (SLWE). The SLWE estimator\nis known to be the state-of-the art approach to tracking properties of\nnon-stationary environments and thus should be a better choice to detect\nchanges in abruptly changing environments than the far more common sliding\nwindow based approaches.

This approach offers an interesting creative process from its\ndistributed representation of information in hidden layers of a deep VGG\nnetwork i.e., information such as contour, shape, etc. are effectively captured\nin hidden layers of neural networks. Conceptually, if $\\Phi$ is the function\nthat transforms input pixels into distributed representations of VGG layers\n${\\bf h}$, a new synthesized image $X$ can be generated from its inverse\nfunction, $X = \\Phi^{-1}({\\bf h})$. We describe the concept behind the\napproach, present some representative synthesized images and style-transferred\nimage examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 07:21:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

However, due to the huge semantic gap between\nusers and items, it's almost impossible to directly match users and items in\ntheir initial representation spaces. To solve this problem, many methods have\nbeen studied, which can be generally categorized into two types, i.e.,\nrepresentation learning-based CF methods and matching function learning-based\nCF methods. Representation learning-based CF methods try to map users and items\ninto a common representation space. In this case, the higher similarity between\na user and an item in that space implies they match better. Matching function\nlearning-based CF methods try to directly learn the complex matching function\nthat maps user-item pairs to matching scores.

We are given logged historical data consisting of\ncontexts, (randomized) actions, and (nonnegative) rewards. A common goal is to\nevaluate what would happen if different actions were taken in the same\ncontexts, so as to optimize the action policies accordingly. The typical\napproach to this problem, inverse probability weighted estimation (IPWE)\n[Bottou et al., 2013], requires logged action probabilities, which may be\nmissing in practice due to engineering complications. Even when available,\nsmall action probabilities cause large uncertainty in IPWE, rendering the\ncorresponding results insignificant. To solve both problems, we show how one\ncan use policy improvement (PIL) objectives, regularized by policy imitation\n(IML). We motivate and analyze PIL as an extension to Clipped-IPWE, by showing\nthat both are lower-bound surrogates to the vanilla IPWE.

No parameters with dimension of length or mass are present in the\nquantum effective action. Quantum scale symmetry is generated by quantum\nfluctuations via the presence of fixed points for running couplings. As for any\nglobal symmetry, the ground state or cosmological state may be scale invariant\nor not. Spontaneous breaking of scale symmetry leads to massive particles and\npredicts a massless Goldstone boson. A massless particle spectrum follows from\nscale symmetry of the effective action only if the ground state is scale\nsymmetric. Approximate scale symmetry close to a fixed point leads to important\npredictions for observations in various areas of fundamental physics.\n  We review consequences of scale symmetry for particle physics, quantum\ngravity and cosmology. For particle physics, scale symmetry is closely linked\nto the tiny ratio between the Fermi scale of weak interactions and the Planck\nscale for gravity. For quantum gravity, scale symmetry is associated to the\nultraviolet fixed point which allows for a non-perturbatively renormalizable\nquantum field theory for all known interactions. The interplay between gravity\nand particle physics at this fixed point permits to predict couplings of the\nstandard model or other \"effective low energy models\" for momenta below the\nPlanck mass. In particular, quantum gravity determines the ratio of Higgs boson\nmass and top quark mass. In cosmology, approximate scale symmetry explains the\nalmost scale-invariant primordial fluctuation spectrum which is at the origin\nof all structures in the universe. The pseudo-Goldstone boson of spontaneously\nbroken approximate scale symmetry may be responsible for dynamical dark energy\nand a solution of the cosmological constant problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 10:07:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 15:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}

By increasing the Mn-doping level, x, of LaAl1-xMnxO3/STO, the\ninterface undergoes a Lifshitz transition at x = 0.225 across a critical\ncarrier density of nc= 2.8E13 cm-2, where a peak TSC =255 mK of superconducting\ntransition temperature is observed. Moreover, the LaAl1-xMnxO3 turns\nferromagnetic at x >=0.25. Remarkably, at x = 0.3, where the metallic interface\nis populated by only dxy electrons and just before it becomes insulating, we\nachieve reproducibly a same device with both signatures of superconductivity\nand clear anomalous Hall effect. This provides a unique and effective way to\ntailor oxide interfaces for designing on-demand electronic and spintronic\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 11:43:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

The emphasis on considering user dissatisfaction and achieving\noptimal competitive ratio differentiates our work from existing ones and makes\nour study uniquely challenging.

In\nthis research, we develop a network-based algorithm which can be used to detect\nIoT bots infected by Mirai or similar malware in large-scale networks (e.g. ISP\nnetwork). The algorithm particularly targets bots scanning the network for\nvulnerable devices since the typical scanning phase for botnets lasts for\nmonths and the bots can be detected much before they are involved in an actual\nattack. We analyze the unique signatures of the Mirai malware to identify its\npresence in an IoT device. The prospective deployment of our bot detection\nsolution is discussed next along with the countermeasures which can be taken\npost detection. Further, to optimize the usage of computational resources, we\nuse a two-dimensional (2D) packet sampling approach, wherein we sample the\npackets transmitted by IoT devices both across time and across the devices.\nLeveraging the Mirai signatures identified and the 2D packet sampling approach,\na bot detection algorithm is proposed.

Although flat bands are known to exist in a\nfew systems such as heavy fermion materials and twisted bilayer graphene, their\nmicroscopic roles and underlying mechanisms in generating emergent behavior\nremain elusive. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy to elucidate the\natomically resolved electronic states and their magnetic response in the kagome\nmagnet Co3Sn2S2.

Such negative magnetism can be understood as\nspin-orbit coupling induced quantum phase effects tied to non-trivial flat band\nsystems. We image the flat band peak, resolve the associated negative\nmagnetism, and provide its connection to the Berry curvature field, showing\nthat Co3Sn2S2 is a rare example of kagome magnet where the low energy physics\ncan be dominated by the spin-orbit coupled flat band.

Many authors have been working on\nthis topic for over many years. Since the existence of a Grundy function on a\ndigraph implies that it must have a kernel, the problem of deciding if a\ndigraph has a Grundy function is NP-complete, and how to calculate one is not\nclearly answered. In this paper, we introduce the concept: Semi-Grundy\nfunction, which arises naturally from the connection between kernel and\nsemi-kernel and the connection between kernel and Grundy function. We explore\nthe relationship of this concept with the Grundy function, proving that for\ndigraphs with a defining hereditary property is sufficient to get a semi-grundy\nfunction to obtain a Grundy function. Then we prove sufficient and necessary\nconditions for some products of digraphs to have a semi-Grundy function. Also,\nit is shown a relationship between the size of the semi-Grundy function\nobtained for the Cartesian Product and the size of the semi-Grundy functions of\nthe factors. This size is an upper bound of the chromatic number. We present a\nfamily of digraphs with the following property: for each natural number $n\\geq\n2$, there is a digraph $R_n$ that has two Grundy functions such that the\ndifference between their maximum values is equal to n. Then it is important to\nhave bounds for the Grundy or semi-Grundy functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 14:28:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

In hybrid\nquantum systems, where two or more quantum systems are combined and made to\ninteract, establishing an efficient control system is particularly challenging\ndue to the higher complexity, especially when each single quantum system is\ncharacterized by a different timescale. Here we present a new control apparatus\nspecifically designed to efficiently manage hybrid quantum systems. The\napparatus is formed by a network of fast communicating Field Programmable Gate\nArrays (FPGAs), the action of which is administrated by a software. Both\nhardware and software share the same tree-like structure, which ensures a full\nscalability of the control apparatus. In the hardware, a master board acts on a\nnumber of slave boards, each of which is equipped with an FPGA that locally\ndrives analog and digital input/output channels and radiofrequency (RF) outputs\nup to 400 MHz. The software is designed to be a general platform for managing\nboth commercial and home-made instruments in a user-friendly and intuitive\nGraphical User Interface (GUI). The architecture ensures that complex control\nprotocols can be carried out, such as performing of concurrent commands loops\nby acting on different channels, the generation of multi-variable error\nfunctions and the implementation of self-optimization procedures. Although\ndesigned for managing experiments with hybrid quantum systems, in particular\nwith atom-ion mixtures, this control apparatus can in principle be used in any\nexperiment in atomic, molecular, and optical physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 14:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

T2-FLAIR contrast can be hypothetically modeled\nthrough deep learning models trained with diffusion- and T2-weighted\nacquisitions.\n  Methods: Diffusion-, T2-, T2-FLAIR-, and T1-weighted brain images were\nacquired in 15 individuals.

Two datasets were withheld from\ntraining for validation.\n  Results: Inputs with physical relationships to T2-FLAIR contrast most\nsignificantly impacted performance.

The goal of the player here is to\nmaximize the cumulative reward in the face of uncertainty. However, the basic\nMAB model neglects several important factors of the system in many real-world\napplications, where multiple arms can be simultaneously played and an arm could\nsometimes be \"sleeping\". Besides, ensuring fairness is also a key design\nconcern in practice. To that end, we propose a new Combinatorial Sleeping MAB\nmodel with Fairness constraints, called CSMAB-F, aiming to address the\naforementioned crucial modeling issues. The objective is now to maximize the\nreward while satisfying the fairness requirement of a minimum selection\nfraction for each individual arm. To tackle this new problem, we extend an\nonline learning algorithm, UCB, to deal with a critical tradeoff between\nexploitation and exploration and employ the virtual queue technique to properly\nhandle the fairness constraints. By carefully integrating these two techniques,\nwe develop a new algorithm, called Learning with Fairness Guarantee (LFG), for\nthe CSMAB-F problem.

To\nthe best of our knowledge, there are no other proposals of data analysis\nmeasures related to the Euclidean distance for which it has been provided\ntheoretical evidence that they are immune to the concentration effect. We\ndetermine the closed form of the distribution of CFOF scores in arbitrarily\nlarge dimensionalities and show that the CFOF score of a point depends on its\nsquared norm standard score and on the kurtosis of the data distribution, thus\nproviding a clear and statistically founded characterization of this notion.\nMoreover, we leverage this closed form to provide evidence that the definition\ndoes not suffer of the hubness problem affecting other measures.

Times Square is notorious\nfor its incessant display of advertisements. Its popularity is worldwide and\nsmaller cities possess miniature versions of the display, such as Pittsburgh\nand its digital works in Oakland on Forbes Avenue. Tokyo's Ginza district\nrecently rose to popularity due to its upscale shops and constant onslaught of\nadvertisements to pedestrians. Advertisements arise in other mediums as well.\nFor example, they help popular streaming services, such as Spotify, Hulu, and\nYoutube TV gather significant streams of revenue to reduce the cost of monthly\nsubscriptions for consumers. Ads provide an additional source of money for\ncompanies and entire industries to allocate resources toward alternative\nbusiness motives. They are attractive to companies and nearly unavoidable for\nconsumers. One challenge for advertisers is examining a advertisement's\neffectiveness or usefulness in conveying a message to their targeted\ndemographics. Rather than constructing a single, static image of content, a\nvideo advertisement possesses hundreds of frames of data with varying scenes,\nactors, objects, and complexity. Therefore, measuring effectiveness of video\nadvertisements is important to impacting a billion-dollar industry. This paper\nexplores the combination of human-annotated features and common video\nprocessing techniques to predict effectiveness ratings of advertisements\ncollected from Youtube. This task is seen as a binary (effective vs.\nnon-effective), four-way, and five-way machine learning classification task.\nThe first findings in terms of accuracy and inference on this dataset, as well\nas some of the first ad research, on a small dataset are presented.

Improved understanding of MB\noscillations can lead to further enhancement in optimizing their efficacy in\nmany applications and also invent new ones. Previous studies have predominantly\naddressed the behavior of a single isolated MB in an infinite liquid domain,\nwhereas most applications employ MBs in clusters. Oscillating MBs have been\nshown to generate secondary pressure waves that modify the dynamics of the MBs\nin their proximity. A modified Keller-Miksis equation is used to account for\ninter-bubble interactions. The oscillatory dynamics of each MB within clusters\nwas computed by numerically solving the resulting system of coupled nonlinear\nsecond order differential equations. Frequency response analysis and\nbifurcation diagrams were employed to track the dynamics of interacting MBs.\nHere we investigate the dynamics of polydisperse MB clusters over a wide range\nof acoustic and geometric parameters. An emergent collective behavior within\nbubble clusters was observed whereby individual dynamics of smaller bubbles\nwere suppressed resulting in a collective behavior dominated by the dynamics of\nthe largest MB within the cluster. The emergent dynamics of smaller MBs within\nbubble clusters can be characterized by constructive and destructive\ninter-bubble interactions. In constructive interactions, the radial\noscillations of smaller bubbles matched those of the largest MB and their\noscillations are amplified. In destructive interactions, the oscillations of\nsmaller bubbles are suppressed so that their oscillations match those of the\nlargest MB. Furthermore, a special case of constructive interactions is\npresented where dominant MB (largest) can force smaller MBs into period\ndoubling and subharmonic oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 21:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-06"}
