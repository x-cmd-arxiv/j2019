As\nfirst, we conduct the textual analysis of the most significant works written by\neminent probability theorists. The textual analysis turns out to be a rather\ninnovative method of study in this domain, and shows how the sampled writers,\nno matter he is a frequentist or a subjectivist, share a similar approach. Each\nauthor argues on the multifold aspects of probability then he establishes the\nmathematical theory on the basis of his intellectual conclusions. It may be\nsaid that mathematics ranks second. Hilbert foresees an approach far different\nfrom that used by the sampled authors. He proposes to axiomatize the\nprobability calculus notably to describe the probability concepts using purely\nmathematical criteria. In the second stage of the present research we address\nthe four issues of the probability theory and statistics following the\nrecommendations of Hilbert. Specifically, we use two theorems that prove how\nthe frequentist and the subjectivist models are not incompatible as many\nbelieve. Probability has distinct meanings under different hypotheses, and in\nturn classical statistics and Bayesian statistics are available for adoption in\ndifferent circumstances. Subsequently, these results are commented upon,\nfollowed by our conclusions\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jan 2019 16:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

When a black hole emerges from quiescence\n(that is, it \"turns on\" after accreting material from its companion) it has a\nvery hard (high-energy) X-ray spectrum produced by a hot corona positioned\nabove its accretion disk, and then transitions to a soft (lower-energy)\nspectrum dominated by emission from the geometrically thin accretion disk,\nwhich extends to the innermost stable circular orbit. Much debate persists over\nhow this transition occurs and whether it is driven largely by a reduction in\nthe truncation radius of the disk or by a reduction in the spatial extent of\nthe corona. Observations of X-ray reverberation lags in supermassive black-hole\nsystems suggest that the corona is compact and that the disk extends nearly to\nthe central black hole. Observations of stellar-mass black holes, however,\nreveal equivalent (mass-scaled) reverberation lags that are much larger,\nleading to the suggestion that the accretion disk in the hard X-ray state of\nstellar-mass black holes is truncated at a few hundreds of gravitational radii\nfrom the black hole. Here we report X-ray observations of the black-hole\ntransient MAXI J1820+070. We find that the reverberation time lags between the\ncontinuum-emitting corona and the irradiated accretion disk are 6 to 20 times\nshorter than previously seen. The timescale of the reverberation lags shortens\nby an order of magnitude over a period of weeks, whereas the shape of the\nbroadened iron K emission line remains remarkably constant. This suggests a\nreduction in the spatial extent of the corona, rather than a change in the\ninner edge of the accretion disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jan 2019 16:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

Tidal effects become significant during the\nlast few orbits and can be visible in the gravitational-wave spectrum above 500\nHz. After the merger, the neutron star remnant oscillates at frequencies above\n1 kHz and can collapse into a black hole. Gravitational-wave detectors with a\nsensitivity of ~10^{-24} strain/sqHz at 2-4 kHz can observe these oscillations\nfrom a source which is ~100 Mpc away. The current observatories, such as LIGO\nand Virgo, are limited by shot noise at high frequencies and have a sensitivity\nof > 2 * 10^{-23} strain/sqHz at 3 kHz.

In nearly all generalizations of the ETAS model, the magnitudes of\nthe background and the triggered earthquakes are assumed to follow\nGutenberg-Richter law with the same exponent (\\b{eta}-value). Furthermore, the\nmagnitudes of the triggered earthquakes are always assumed to be independent of\nthe magnitude of the triggering earthquake.

Our results have\nshown that the Schottky barrier at the MoS2-metal interface plays an important\nrole in the photoresponse dynamics of the heterojunction. When the MoS2 channel\nis in the on-state, photo-excited carriers can tunnel through the narrow\ndepletion region at the MoS2-metal interface, leading to a short carrier\ntransit time. A response time constant of 13 {\\mu}s has been achieved in both\nthe rising and decaying regions regardless of the incident laser wavelength,\nwhich is comparable or higher than those of other BP-MoS2 heterojunctions as\nwell as BP and MoS2 based phototransistors.

This new network paradigm offers a great flexibility to\nInternet service providers (ISPs) for efficiently operating their networks\n(collecting network statistics, enforcing management policies, etc.). However,\nintroducing NFV requires an investment to deploy VNFs at certain network nodes\n(called VNF-nodes), which has to account for practical constraints such as the\ndeployment budget and the VNF-node capacity. To that end, it is important to\ndesign a joint VNF-nodes placement and capacity allocation algorithm that can\nmaximize the total amount of network flows that are fully processed by the\nVNF-nodes while respecting such practical constraints. In contrast to most\nprior work that often neglects either the budget constraint or the capacity\nconstraint, we explicitly consider both of them. We prove that accounting for\nthese constraints introduces several new challenges. Specifically, we prove\nthat the studied problem is not only NP-hard but also non-submodular.

A close relative of\ninterferometric inversion is the generalized phase retrieval problem, which\nconsists of recovering a signal from the auto-correlations of its linear\ntransformations. Recently, significant advancements have been made in phase\nretrieval methods despite the ill-posed, and non-convex nature of the problem.\nOne such method is Wirtinger Flow (WF), a non-convex optimization framework\nthat provides high probability guarantees of exact recovery under certain\nmeasurement models, such as coded diffraction patterns, and Gaussian sampling\nvectors. In this paper, we develop a generalization of WF for interferometric\ninversion, which we refer to as Generalized Wirtinger Flow (GWF). GWF theory\nextends the probabilistic exact recovery results of WF to arbitrary measurement\nmodels characterized in the equivalent lifted problem, hence covers a larger\nclass of measurement models. Our framework unifies the theory of low rank\nmatrix recovery (LRMR) and the non-convex optimization approach of WF, thereby\nestablishes theoretical advantages of the non-convex approach over LRMR. We\nidentify a new sufficient condition on the lifted forward model that directly\nimplies exact recovery conditions of standard WF. This condition is less\nstringent than those of LRMR, which is the state of the art approach for exact\ninterferometric inversion. We establish our sufficient condition for the\ncross-correlations of linear measurements collected by complex Gaussian\nsampling vectors, and show that the exact recovery conditions of standard WF\nimply our sufficient condition. As a result, the regularity condition of WF\nbecomes redundant in solving the interferometric inversion problem.

In a model in which the resonance\nenergies of the reactions 3He(d, p)4He and 3H(d, n)4He are insensitive to the\nquark mass, we find that the Li abundance can be consistent with observations\nfor delta m_q/m_q = (4--8) times 10^{-3}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jan 2019 07:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

This catalog motivated follow-up\nstudies by both the MAGIC and Fermi-LAT observatories with the aim of\ninvestigating gamma-ray emission over a broad energy band. In this paper, we\nreport the results from the first joint work between HAWC, MAGIC and Fermi-LAT\non three unassociated HAWC sources: 2HWC J2006+341, 2HWC J1907+084* and 2HWC\nJ1852+013*. Although no significant detection was found in the HE and VHE\nregimes, this investigation shows that a minimum 1 degree extension (at 95%\nconfidence level) and harder spectrum in the GeV than the one extrapolated from\nHAWC results are required in the case of 2HWC J1852+013*, while a simply\nminimum extension of 0.16 degrees (at 95% confidence level) can already explain\nthe scenario proposed by HAWC for the remaining sources.

More precisely, we look at the\ncompute time and at the cost per task for a given task. The tasks studied is\nthe count of the occurrence of a given word in a corpus. We compare the\nserverless architecture to the Apache Spark map reduce technique commonly used\nfor this type of task.

However, none of this work involves scattering\ncalculations. In contrast to this work, currently accepted physical theory\nconnects classical physics to only the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. Indeed, in the\npast, it has been shown that a nonlinear classical oscillator (which is\nnecessarily a nonrelativistic scattering system) achieves equilibrium only for\nthe Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum where the random radiation present at the frequency\nof the second harmonic of the oscillator motion has the same energy per normal\nmode as the radiation present at the fundamental frequency. Here we continue\nwork emphasizing the importance of relativistic versus nonrelativistic\nanalysis. We consider the scattering of random classical radiation by a charged\nharmonic oscillator of small but non-zero oscillatory amplitude (which can be\nconsidered as a relativistic scattering system) and show that detailed\nradiation balance holds not only at the fundamental frequency of the oscillator\nbut through the first harmonic corresponding to quadrupole scattering, provided\nthat the radiation energy per normal mode at the first harmonic is double the\nradiation energy per normal mode at the fundamental frequency. This condition\ncorresponds exactly to the zero-point radiation spectrum which is linear in\nfrequency. It is suggested that for this relativistic scattering system, the\ndetailed balance for zero-point radiation holds not only for the fundamental\nand first harmonic but extends to all harmonics. Here we have the first example\nof the detailed balance of zero-point radiation under relativistic scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jan 2019 19:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-17"}

This paper\nprovides a Virtual Reality (VR) environment in which the user can experience\nlifting process in an immerse virtual environment. Providing such a VR model\nnot only facilitates planning for critical lifts (e.g. modules, heavy vessels),\nbut also it provides a training environment to enhance safe climate prior to\nthe actual lift.

As a result, researchers have often resorted to annotating\ntheir own training and testing data. However, different researchers may\nannotate different classes, or use different train and test splits. In\naddition, it is common for papers that apply machine learning for facies\nclassification to not contain quantitative results, and rather rely solely on\nvisual inspection of the results. All of these practices have lead to\nsubjective results and have greatly hindered the ability to compare different\nmachine learning models against each other and understand the advantages and\ndisadvantages of each approach.\n  To address these issues, we open-source a fully-annotated 3D geological model\nof the Netherlands F3 Block.

The model\nspectra of mixtures of PAHs show good fit for most bands except for the 6.2\nmicron feature. Thus a wider variety of PAHs need to be considered for this\nfeature. PAH formation in circumstellar medium of planetary nebulae and dense\nclouds indicate formation of phenyl radical and phenyl substituted PAHs.
