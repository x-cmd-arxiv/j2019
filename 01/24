The target is to estimate the probability that the\nquantity of interest (QoI) in a complex system is beyond a given threshold. To\navoid the prohibitive cost of sampling a large scale system, the reduced-order\nmodel is usually considered for a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.\nHowever, the Monte Carlo estimator given by the reduced-order model is biased\ndue to the error from dimension reduction. To correct the bias, we still need\nto sample the fine model. An effective technique to reduce the variance\nreduction is importance sampling, where we employ the generative model to\nestimate the distribution of the data from the reduced-order model and use it\nfor the change of measure in the importance sampling estimator. To compensate\nthe approximation errors of the reduced-order model, more data that induce a\nslightly smaller QoI than the threshold need to be included into the training\nset. Although the amount of these data can be controlled by a posterior error\nestimate, redundant data, which may outnumber the effective data, will be kept\ndue to the epistemic uncertainty. To deal with this issue, we introduce a\nweighted empirical distribution to process the data from the reduced-order\nmodel. The generative model is then trained by minimizing the cross entropy\nbetween it and the weighted empirical distribution. We also introduce a penalty\nterm into the objective function to deal with the overfitting for more\nrobustness. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 16:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

The\nadditional ingredient with respect to the wave function is a position in the\nconfiguration space, which drives the collapse in a completely deterministic\nway. This new variable is equivalent to a set of positions of all the\nparticles, i.e. a set of Bohmian positions, which obey the usual guiding\nequation of Bohmian theory. Any superposition of quantum states of a\nmacroscopic object occupying different regions of space is projected by a\nlocalization process onto the region occupied by the positions. Since the\nBohmian positions are well defined in a single realization of the experiment, a\nspace localization into one region is produced. The mechanism is based on the\ncorrelations between these positions arising from the cohesive forces inside\nmacroscopic objects.\n  The model introduces two collapse parameters, which play a very similar role\nto those of the GRW and CSL theories. With appropriate values of these\nparameters, we check that the corresponding dynamics rapidly projects\nsuperpositions of macroscopic states localized in different regions of space\ninto a single region, while is keeps a negligible effect in all situations\nwhere the predictions of standard quantum dynamics are known to be correct. The\npossible relations with gravity are briefly speculated.

From a computational\npoint of view, a local parameterization where the parameters are separately\ndefined in each subdomain is very attractive. In this study we present one such\nlocal parameterization through integrating principle component analysis with\ndomain decomposition to independently represent the spatial parameter field\nwithin low-order parameter subspaces in each subdomain. This local\nparameterization allows us to perturb parameters in each subdomain\nsimultaneously and the effects of all these perturbations can be computed with\nonly a few full-order model simulations. To avoid non-smoothness at the\nboundaries of neighboring subdomains, the optimal local parameters are\nprojected onto a global parameterization. The performance of subdomain POD-TPWL\nwith local parameterization has been assessed through two cases tested on a\nmodified version of SAIGUP model. This local parameterization has high\nscalability, since the number of training models depends primarily on the\nnumber of the local parameters in each subdomain and not on the dimension of\nthe underlying full-order model. Activating more subdomains results in less\nlocal parameter patterns and enables us to run less model simulations. For a\nlarge-scale case-study in this work, to optimize 282 global parameters, LP-SD\nPOD-TPWL only needs 90 fidelity simulations. In comparison to the\nfinite-difference based history matching, and subdomain POD-TPWL with global\nparameterization where the parameters are defined over the entire domain, the\nCPU cost is reduced by a factor of several orders of the magnitude while\nreasonable accuracy remains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 16:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-25"}

In the numerical simulations the shallow\ngradient is created by the effects of dilution by outflow where low-metallicity\nmaterial is mixed with enriched gas.

We further show that Gaia DR2 effective temperatures for\nM-dwarfs are underestimated by $\\sim$ 8.2 % and give an empirical\n$M_{G}$-$T_{\\rm eff}$ relation which is better suited for M-dwarfs with $T_{\\rm\neff}$ between 2600 and 4000 K. Most importantly, we are able to observationally\nidentify a discontinuity in the $T_{\\rm eff}$-radius plane, which is likely due\nto the transition from partially convective M-dwarfs to the fully convective\nregime. We found this transition to happen between 3200 K and 3340 K, or\nequivalently for stars with masses $\\approx 0.23 M_{\\odot}$. We find that in\nthis transition region the stellar radii are in the range from 0.18 to\n0.42$R_{\\odot}$ for similar stellar effective temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 19:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-25"}

Specifically, it revisits computational secret sharing in a situation\nwhere the encryption key is exposed to an attacker. It comes with several\ncontributions: First, it defines a security model for encryption schemes, where\nwe ask for additional resilience against exposure of the encryption key.\nPrecisely we ask for (1) indistinguishability of plaintexts under full\nciphertext knowledge, (2) indistinguishability for an adversary who learns: the\nencryption key, plus all but one share of the ciphertext. (2) relaxes the\n\"all-or-nothing\" property to a more realistic setting, where the ciphertext is\ntransformed into a number of shares, such that the adversary can't access one\nof them.

Second, it introduces a new\ncomputationally secure encryption-then-sharing scheme, that protects the data\nin the previously defined attacker model.

It emphasizes that the\nsecurity of our scheme relies only on a simple cryptanalysis resilience\nassumption for blockciphers in public key mode: indistinguishability from\nrandom, of the sequence of diferentials of a random value.

Some systems,\nhowever, have been shown to avoid critical slowing down prior to a transition\nbetween equilibria, e.g. (Ditlevsen and Johnsen, 2010). Possible explanations\ninclude non-smooth potential driving the dynamic (Hastings and Wysham, 2010) or\nlarge perturbations driving the system out of the initial basin of attraction.\nIn this paper we discuss a phenomenon analogous to critical slowing down, where\na slow parameter change leads to a high likelihood of a regime shift and\ncreates signature warning signs in the statistics of the process's sample\npaths. In short, if a basin of attraction is compressed under a parameter\nchange then the potential well steepens, leading to a drop in the time series'\nvariance and autocorrelation; precisely the opposite warning signs exhibited by\ncritical slowing down. This effect, which we call `critical speeding up,' is\ndemonstrated using a simple ecological model exhibiting an Allee effect. The\nfact that both dropping and rising variance / autocorrelation can indicate\nimminent state change should underline the need for reliable modeling of any\nempirical system where one desires to forecast regime change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 19:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-25"}

Using high\ntemporal resolution measurements by MEG, we detect bursts of activity from\nhundreds of locations across the surface of the brain at millisecond\nresolution. We then compare decoding using three characteristics of neural\nactivity bursts, decoding with event counts, with latencies and with time\ndifferences between pairs of events. Training decoders in this regime is\nparticularly challenging because the number of samples is smaller by orders of\nmagnitude than the input dimensionality. We develop a new decoding approach for\nthis regime that combines non-parametric modelling with aggressive feature\nselection.

As such, in this\npaper, we devise a new WBC, dubbed whole-body locomotion controller (WBLC),\nthat can achieve experimental dynamic walking on unsupported passive-ankle\nbiped robots. A key aspect of WBLC is the relaxation of contact constraints\nsuch that the control commands produce reduced jerk when switching foot\ncontacts. To achieve robust dynamic locomotion, we conduct an in-depth analysis\nof uncertainty for our dynamic walking algorithm called\ntime-to-velocity-reversal (TVR) planner.

On the other hand, distillation is a simple general-purpose\noptimization technique which is broadly applicable for transferring knowledge\nfrom a trained, high capacity teacher network to an untrained, low capacity\nstudent network.

Our predictions suggest, and our findings based on the\nSurvey of Professional Forecasters reveal, that the Kalman Filter can help\nmanagers solve their decision-making problems by giving them stronger signals\nbefore they choose. Indeed, when used on a subset of forecasters identified by\nthe Contribution Weighted Model, the Kalman Filter beat that rule clearly,\nacross all the forecasting horizons in the survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 21:17:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-25"}

This knowledge is\ncanonically acquired through channel estimation procedures conducted after a\npilot signaling phase, which adopts the widely accepted time-division duplex\nscheme. However, the quality of channel estimation is very impacted either by\npilot contamination or by spatial correlation of the channels. There are\nseveral models that strive to match the spatial correlation in M-MIMO channels,\nthe exponential correlation model being one of these. To observe how the\nchannel estimation and pilot contamination are affected by this correlated\nfading model, this work proposes to investigate an M-MIMO scenario applying the\nstandard minimum mean square error channel estimation approach over uniform\nlinear arrays and uniform planar arrays (ULAs and UPAs, respectively) of\nantennas. Moreover, the elements of the array are considered to contribute\nunequally on the communication, owing to large-scale fading variations over the\narray. Thus, it was perceived that the spatially correlated channels generated\nby this combined model offer a reduction of pilot contamination, consequently\nthe estimation quality is improved. The UPA acquired better results regarding\npilot contamination since it has been demonstrated that this type of array\ngenerates stronger levels of spatial correlation than the ULA. In contrast to\nthe favorable results in channel estimation, the channel hardening effect was\nimpaired by the spatially correlated channels, where the UPA imposes the worst\nperformance of this effect for the discussed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 21:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-25"}

A key ingredient of continuum models is the choice of the solute\ncavity, i.e. the definition of the sharp or smooth boundary between the regions\nof space occupied by the quantum-mechanical (QM) system and the continuum\nembedding environment. Although most of the solute-based approaches developed\nlead to models with comparable and high accuracy when applied to small organic\nmolecules, they can introduce significant artifacts when complex systems are\nconsidered. As an example, condensed-matter simulations often deal with\nsupports that present open structures. Similarly, unphysical pockets of\ncontinuum solvent may appear in systems featuring multiple molecular\ncomponents. Here, we introduce a solvent-aware approach to eliminate the\nunphysical effects where regions of space smaller than the size of a single\nsolvent molecule could still be filled with a continuum environment. We do this\nby defining a smoothly varying solute cavity that overcomes several of the\nlimitations of straightforward solute-based definitions. This new approach\napplies to any smooth local definition of the continuum interface, being it\nbased on the electronic density or the atomic positions of the QM system. It\nproduces boundaries that are continuously differentiable with respect to the QM\ndegrees of freedom, leading to accurate forces and/or Kohn-Sham potentials.\nBenchmarks on semiconductor substrates and on explicit water substrates confirm\nthe flexibility and the accuracy of the approach and provide a general set of\nparameters for condensed-matter systems featuring open structures and/or\nexplicit liquid components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 21:41:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-25"}

Building upon previous studies, we\nanalyze the C/O relationship for a combined sample of 40 galaxies with\nsignificant detections of the UV O+2/C+2 collisionally-excited lines and\ndirect-method oxygen abundance measurements. Using new analytic carbon\nionization correction factor relationships, we confirm the flat trend in C/O\nversus O/H observed for local metal-poor galaxies. We find an average log(C/O)\n= -0.71 with an intrinsic dispersion of {\\sigma} = 0.17 dex. The C/N ratio also\nappears to be constant at log(C/N) = 0.75, plus significant scatter ({\\sigma} =\n0.20 dex), with the result that carbon and nitrogen show similar evolutionary\ntrends. This large and real scatter in C/O over a large range in O/H implies\nthat measuring the UV C and O emission lines alone does not provide a reliable\nindicator of the O/H abundance. By modeling the chemical evolution of C, N, and\nO of individual targets, we find that the C/O ratio is very sensitive to both\nthe detailed star formation history and to supernova feedback. Longer burst\ndurations and lower star formation efficiencies correspond to low C/O ratios,\nwhile the escape of oxygen atoms in supernovae winds produces decreased\neffective oxygen yields and larger C/O ratios. Further, a declining C/O\nrelationship is seen with increasing baryonic mass due to increasing effective\noxygen yields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 22:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

Comparing their distribution in projected-phase-space to those\nderived from cosmological simulations indicates that the cluster HDSGs are\nconsistent with an infalling population that have entered the central\n0.5$r_{200, 3D}$ cluster region within the last $\\sim 1\\,$Gyr. In the 8/9\ncluster HDSGs with central star formation, the extent of star formation is\nconsistent with that expected of outside-in quenching by ram-pressure\nstripping. Our results indicate that the cluster HDSGs are currently being\nquenched by ram-pressure stripping on their first passage through the cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 01:02:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

In particular, we exhibit a\nsequence of binary linear codes that approaches capacity on the BEC with\nquasi-linear complexity and scaling exponent $\\mu < 3$. To the best of our\nknowledge, such a sequence of codes was not previously known to exist. The\nprincipal challenges in establishing our results are twofold: how to construct\nsuch kernels and how to evaluate their scaling exponent.\n  In a single polarization step, an $\\ell\\times\\ell$ kernel $K_\\ell$ transforms\nan underlying BEC into $\\ell$ bit-channels $W_1,W_2,\\ldots,W_\\ell$. The erasure\nprobabilities of $W_1,W_2,\\ldots,W_\\ell$, known as the polarization behavior of\n$K_\\ell$, determine the resulting scaling exponent $\\mu(K_\\ell)$. We first\nintroduce a class of self-dual binary kernels and prove that their polarization\nbehavior satisfies a strong symmetry property. This reduces the problem of\nconstructing $K_\\ell$ to that of producing a certain nested chain of only\n$\\ell/2$ self-orthogonal codes. We use nested cyclic codes, whose distance is\nas high as possible subject to the orthogonality constraint, to construct the\nkernels $K_{32}$ and $K_{64}$. In order to evaluate the polarization behavior\nof $K_{32}$ and $K_{64}$, two alternative trellis representations (which may be\nof independent interest) are proposed. Using the resulting trellises, we show\nthat $\\mu(K_{32})=3.122$ and explicitly compute over half of the polarization\nbehavior coefficients for $K_{64}$, at which point the complexity becomes\nprohibitive. To complete the computation, we introduce a Monte-Carlo\ninterpolation method, which produces the estimate $\\mu(K_{64})\\simeq 2.87$.

Along the solar surface, the quasi-peridoic wavefronts had a\nperiod of about 163 +/- 21 seconds and propagated at a nearly constant speed of\n747 +/- 26 km/s; they interacted with active region AR11469 and launched a\nsympathetic upward propagating secondary EUV wave.

The main\nproblem is that hardwiring such machines with rules not to cause harm or damage\nis not consistent with the notion of autonomy and intelligence. Also, such\nethical hardwiring does not leave intelligent autonomous machines with any\ncourse of action if they encounter situations or dilemmas for which they are\nnot programmed or where some harm is caused no matter what course of action is\ntaken. Teaching machines so that they learn ethics may also be problematic\ngiven recent findings in machine learning that machines pick up the prejudices\nand biases embedded in their learning algorithms or data. This paper describes\na fuzzy reasoning approach to machine ethics. The paper shows how it is\npossible for an ethics architecture to reason when taking over from a human\ndriver is morally justified. The design behind such an ethical reasoner is also\napplied to an ethical dilemma resolution case. One major advantage of the\napproach is that the ethical reasoner can generate its own data for learning\nmoral rules (hence, autometric) and thereby reduce the possibility of picking\nup human biases and prejudices. The results show that a new type of\nmetric-based ethics appropriate for autonomous intelligent machines is feasible\nand that our current concept of ethical reasoning being largely qualitative in\nnature may need revising if want to construct future autonomous machines that\nhave an ethical dimension to their reasoning so that they become moral\nmachines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 03:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-25"}

High-mass\nstars usually form in Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) as part of a young stellar\ncluster, but some OB stars are observed far from GMCs. By examining the spatial\ncoincidence between the high-mass YSOs and 12CO (J = 1-0) emission detected by\nNANTEN and Mopra observations, we selected ten high-mass YSOs that are located\naway from any of the NANTEN clouds but are detected by the Mopra pointed\nobservations. The ALMA observations revealed that a compact molecular cloud\nwhose mass is a few thousand solar masses or smaller is associated with the\nhigh-mass YSOs, which indicates that these compact clouds are the sites of\nhigh-mass star formation. The high-density and high-temperature throughout the\nclouds are explained by the severe photodissociation of CO due to the lower\nmetallicity than in the Galaxy. The star formation efficiency ranges from\nseveral to as high as ~ 40%, indicating efficient star formation in these\nenvironments. The enhanced turbulence may be a cause of the efficient star\nformation therein, as judged from the gas velocity information and the\nassociation with the lower density gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 06:38:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

In particular, the\noutflow in the mid-plane region may prevent the accretion of the solid\nmaterials and delay the formation of super-Earths' cores. However, it is not\nyet understood how the nature of the flow field and outflow speed change as a\nfunction of the planetary mass. In this study, we investigate the dependence of\ngas flow around a planet embedded in a protoplanetary disc on the planetary\nmass. Assuming an isothermal, inviscid gas disc, we perform three-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulations on the spherical polar grid, which has a planet\nlocated at its centre. We find that gas enters the Bondi or Hill sphere at high\nlatitudes and exits through the mid-plane region of the disc regardless of the\nassumed dimensionless planetary mass $m=R_{\\rm Bondi}/H$, where $R_{\\rm Bondi}$\nand $H$ are the Bondi radius of the planet and disc scale height, respectively.\nThe altitude from where gas predominantly enters the envelope varies with the\nplanetary mass. The outflow speed can be expressed as $|u_{\\rm\nout}|=\\sqrt{3/2}mc_{\\rm s}$ $(R_{\\rm Bondi}\\leq R_{\\rm Hill})$ or $|u_{\\rm\nout}|=\\sqrt{3/2}(m/3)^{1/3} c_{\\rm s}$ ($R_{\\rm Bondi}\\geq R_{\\rm Hill}$),\nwhere $c_{\\rm s}$ is the isothermal sound speed and $R_{\\rm Hill}$ is the Hill\nradius. The outflow around a planet may reduce the accretion of dust and\npebbles onto the planet when $m\\gtrsim\\sqrt{\\rm St}$, where St is the Stokes\nnumber. Our results suggest that the flow around proto-cores of super-Earths\nmay delay their growth and, consequently, help them to avoid runaway gas\naccretion within the lifetime of the gas disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 06:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

We have also considered the possibilities that both branches have\ndifferent parameters, and found that if some of the physical parameters of the\ncounter-jet are evaluated more favorably than those of the near-jet, then the\ncounter-jet emission will be enhanced and will clearly show up as an obvious\nplateau or even a rebrightening. For example, when the circum-burst medium\nencountered by the counter-jet is assumed to be 100 times denser than that of\nthe near-jet, a remarkable radio plateau will appear at $\\sim$ 600 days.\nHowever, in X-ray bands, the counter-jet component is generally too faint to be\ndiscerned. It is argued that the late radio observations of GW170817/GRB\n170817A can help determine the key parameters and diagnose the environment of\nthe event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 08:01:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 03:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

The\nnew approach is based on the combination of the fourth-order compact finite\ndifference scheme and the preconditioned stabilized biconjugate-gradient\n(BiCGSTAB) method. Contrary to the original immersed interface method by\nLeVeque and Li [1], the new method does not require jump corrections, instead,\nthe (regular) compact finite difference stencil is adjusted at the irregular\ngrid points (in the vicinity of the interfaces of the immersed bodies) to\nobtain a solution that is sharp across the interface while keeping the\nfourth-order global accuracy. The contribution of the present work is the\ndesign of a fourth-order-accurate 3D Poisson solver whose accuracy and\nefficiency does not deteriorate in the presence of an immersed boundary. This\nis attributed to (i) the modification of the discrete operators near immersed\nboundaries does not lead to a wide grid stencil due to the compact nature of\nthe discretization and (ii) a preconditioning technique whose efficiency and\ncost are independent of the complexity of the geometry and the presence or not\nof an immersed boundary.

However, it is difficult to\navoid self-intersection between body parts accurately. Motivated by this fact,\nwe proposed a novel self-intersection penalty term for statistical body shape\nmodels applied in 3D pose estimation. To avoid the trouble of computing\nself-intersection for complex surfaces like the body meshes, the gradient of\nour proposed self-intersection penalty term is manually derived from the\nperspective of geometry. First, the self-intersection penalty term is defined\nas the volume of the self-intersection region. To calculate the partial\nderivatives with respect to the coordinates of the vertices, we employed\ndetection rays to divide vertices of statistical body shape models into\ndifferent groups depending on whether the vertex is in the region of\nself-intersection. Second, the partial derivatives could be easily derived by\nthe normal vectors of neighboring triangles of the vertices. Finally, this\npenalty term could be applied in gradient-based optimization algorithms to\nremove the self-intersection of triangular meshes without using any\napproximation. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations were conducted to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our proposed method compared\nwith previous approaches. The experimental results show that our proposed\npenalty term can avoid self-intersection to exclude unreasonable predictions\nand improves the accuracy of 3D pose estimation indirectly.

An Allan deviation-based stability analysis of the setup\nyields an optimal 0.1 Hz measurement bandwidth over which the microscope is\nthermally limited. Over this bandwidth, and with a genuine sine-wave external\ndrive, we demonstrate an optical force resolution down to 3 fN in water at room\ntemperature with a dynamical range for force detection that covers almost 2\norders of magnitude. This resolution is reached both in the confined and freely\ndiffusing regimes of the optical trap.

Data with underlying graph structure can be found across many\ndisciplines and there is a natural desire for understanding such data better.\nDeep learning (DL) has achieved significant breakthroughs in a variety of\nmachine learning tasks in recent years, especially where data is structured on\na grid, such as in text, speech, or image understanding. However, surprisingly\nlittle has been done to explore the applicability of DL on arbitrary\ngraph-structured data directly.\n  The goal of this thesis is to investigate architectures for DL on graphs and\nstudy how to transfer, adapt or generalize concepts that work well on\nsequential and image data to this domain. We concentrate on two important\nprimitives: embedding graphs or their nodes into a continuous vector space\nrepresentation (encoding) and, conversely, generating graphs from such vectors\nback (decoding). To that end, we make the following contributions.\n  First, we introduce Edge-Conditioned Convolutions (ECC), a convolution-like\noperation on graphs performed in the spatial domain where filters are\ndynamically generated based on edge attributes. The method is used to encode\ngraphs with arbitrary and varying structure.\n  Second, we propose SuperPoint Graph, an intermediate point cloud\nrepresentation with rich edge attributes encoding the contextual relationship\nbetween object parts. Based on this representation, ECC is employed to segment\nlarge-scale point clouds without major sacrifice in fine details.\n  Third, we present GraphVAE, a graph generator allowing us to decode graphs\nwith variable but upper-bounded number of nodes making use of approximate graph\nmatching for aligning the predictions of an autoencoder with its inputs.

A tunnel starts with an encapsulation and ends with the\ncorresponding decapsulation. Several tunnels can be nested at some stage,\nforming a protocol stack. Tunneling is very important nowadays and it is\ninvolved in several tasks: IPv4/IPv6 transition, VPNs, security (IPsec, onion\nrouting), etc. However, tunnel establishment is mainly performed manually or by\nscript, which present obvious scalability issues. Some works attempt to\nautomate a part of the process (e.g., TSP, ISATAP, etc.). However, the\ndetermination of the tunnel(s) endpoints is not fully automated, especially in\nthe case of an arbitrary number of nested tunnels. The lack of routing\nprotocols performing automatic tunneling is due to the unavailability of path\ncomputation algorithms taking into account encapsulations and decapsulations.\nThere is a polynomial centralized algorithm to perform the task. However, to\nthe best of our knowledge, no fully distributed path computation algorithm is\nknown. Here, we propose the first fully distributed algorithm for path\ncomputation with automatic tunneling, i.e., taking into account encapsulation,\ndecapsulation and conversion of protocols. Our algorithm is a generalization of\nthe distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm, where the distance vector is replaced\nby a protocol stack vector. This allows to know how to route a packet with some\nprotocol stack. We prove that the messages size of our algorithm is polynomial,\neven if the shortest path can be of exponential length. We also prove that the\nalgorithm converges after a polynomial number of steps in a synchronized\nsetting.

A virtual link defines the level of interaction between each\nparticle pair. The state of the virtual link is determined by damage law or\ncracking criterion. The virtual link approach allows easy and natural modelling\nof cracking surfaces without explicit cracking treatments such as particle\nsplitting, field enrichment or visibility criterion. The performance of the\nproposed approach is demonstrated via a few numerical examples of both brittle\nand ductile failure under impact loading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 10:49:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-25"}

First we describe a simple procedure to exactly calculate the stability\nangle $\\alpha$ in the definition of $A(\\alpha)$-stability. As an illustration,\nwe consider two finite families of implicit multistep methods: we exactly\ncompute the stability angles for the $k$-step BDF methods ($3\\le k\\le 6$) and\nfor the $k$-step second-derivative multistep methods of Enright ($3\\le k\\le\n7$).

Based on this observation, we\nsuggest that addressing adversarial examples requires rethinking the use of\ncross-entropy loss function and looking for an alternative that is more suited\nfor minimization with low-rank features. In this direction, we present a\ntraining scheme called differential training, which uses a loss function\ndefined on the differences between the features of points from opposite\nclasses. We show that differential training can ensure a large margin between\nthe decision boundary of the neural network and the points in the training\ndataset. This larger margin increases the amount of perturbation needed to flip\nthe prediction of the classifier and makes it harder to find an adversarial\nexample with small perturbations.

Among\nthe several sources of variability the ML models have to deal with, a major\nfactor is the acquisition device, which can limit the ML model's\ngeneralizability. In this paper, we propose to reduce the image variability\nacross different OCT devices (Spectralis and Cirrus) by using CycleGAN, an\nunsupervised unpaired image transformation algorithm. The usefulness of this\napproach is evaluated in the setting of retinal fluid segmentation, namely\nintraretinal cystoid fluid (IRC) and subretinal fluid (SRF). First, we train a\nsegmentation model on images acquired with a source OCT device. Then we\nevaluate the model on (1) source, (2) target and (3) transformed versions of\nthe target OCT images. The presented transformation strategy shows an F1 score\nof 0.4 (0.51) for IRC (SRF) segmentations. Compared with traditional\ntransformation approaches, this means an F1 score gain of 0.2 (0.12).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 12:37:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 09:12:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-28"}

Framed in the PAC setting, this\nparticular problem generalises both the problem of `best subset selection' and\nthat of selecting `one out of the best m' arms [arcsk 2017]. In applications\nsuch as crowd-sourcing and drug-designing, identifying a single good solution\nis often not sufficient. Moreover, finding the best subset might be hard due to\nthe presence of many indistinguishably close solutions. Our generalisation of\nidentifying exactly $k$ arms out of the best $m$, where $1 \\leq k \\leq m$,\nserves as a more effective alternative. We present a lower bound on the\nworst-case sample complexity for general $k$, and a fully sequential PAC\nalgorithm, \\GLUCB, which is more sample-efficient on easy instances. Also,\nextending our analysis to infinite-armed bandits, we present a PAC algorithm\nthat is independent of $n$, which identifies an arm from the best $\\rho$\nfraction of arms using at most an additive poly-log number of samples than\ncompared to the lower bound, thereby improving over [arcsk 2017] and\n[Aziz+AKA:2018]. The problem of identifying $k > 1$ distinct arms from the best\n$\\rho$ fraction is not always well-defined; for a special class of this\nproblem, we present lower and upper bounds. Finally, through a reduction, we\nestablish a relation between upper bounds for the `one out of the best $\\rho$'\nproblem for infinite instances and the `one out of the best $m$' problem for\nfinite instances. We conjecture that it is more efficient to solve `small'\nfinite instances using the latter formulation, rather than going through the\nformer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 12:56:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-25"}

This may become a problem for\nthe cases where the number of available words of memory is limited. Designing\nan efficient regret minimisation algorithm that uses a constant number of words\nhas long been interesting to the community. Some early attempts consider the\nnumber of arms to be infinite, and require the reward distribution of the arms\nto belong to some particular family. Recently, for finitely many-armed bandits\nan explore-then-commit based algorithm~\\citep{Liau+PSY:2018} seems to escape\nsuch assumption.

We design a particle state feature\nvector based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), modeling the mixed\ncontribution of neighboring proxy particles on the blood vessel wall and\nneighboring blood particles, giving the extrapolation ability to deal with more\ncomplex couplings. We present a semi-supervised training strategy to improve\nthe traditional BP neural network, which corrects the error periodically to\nensure long term stability. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is\nable to implement stable and vivid coupling of blood flow and vessel wall while\ngreatly improving computational efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 13:32:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-25"}

In\nthis sense, a system model with a power line modem injecting signals and\ncapturing raising reflections for sensing a power distribution network is\noutlined. Next, pulse compression and channel estimation reflectogram\nprocessing approaches are carefully described and the effects of system\nparametrization and multiple access schemes on the HS-OFDM-based TDR system\nperformance are addressed. Finally, numerical results covering a comparison\nbetween pulse compression and channel estimation, system limitations based on\nparametrization considering typical European underground low-voltage and US\noverhead medium-voltage (MV) scenarios and narrowband (NB) power line\ncommunication (PLC) regulatory constraints, and comparison among multiple\naccess techniques in a Brazilian MV overhead scenario are presented for\nsupporting the carried out discussion.

Finally, we describe\na bulge chasing scheme for converting the initial LFR decomposition of $A$ into\nthe LFR decomposition of a Hessenberg matrix by means of unitary\ntransformations. The reduction can be performed at the overall computational\ncost of $O(n^2 k)$ arithmetic operations using $O(nk)$ storage. The computed\nLFR decomposition of the Hessenberg reduction of $A$ can be processed by the\nfast QR algorithm presented in [8] in order to compute the eigenvalues of $A$\nwithin the same costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 13:57:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 09:01:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-30"}

Differing from traditional\nover-sampling techniques, TOMO not only can balance the data but reduce the\ndistribution difference.

The five most commonly used FS methods including weight\nby Gini, weight by Chi-square, hierarchical variable clustering, weight by\ncorrelation, and weight by information are applied to alleviate the effect of\nredundant features. Two hyper-parameter optimization approaches, random search\n(RS) and Bayesian tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE), are applied in\nXGBoost. The effect of different FS and hyper-parameter optimization methods on\nthe model performance are investigated by the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test.

Both TPE and RS\noptimization in XGBoost outperform LR significantly. TPE optimization shows a\nsuperiority over RS since it results in a significantly higher accuracy and a\nmarginally higher AUC, recall and F1 score. Furthermore, XGBoost with TPE\ntuning shows a lower variability than the RS method. Finally, the ranking of\nfeature importance based on XGBoost enhances the model interpretation.\nTherefore, XGBoost with Bayesian TPE hyper-parameter optimization serves as an\noperative while powerful approach for business risk modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 14:40:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-25"}

Three-fold cross-validation was applied to generate independent\nresults for the entire dataset. The synthetic CT images were quantitatively\nevaluated with the mean absolute error metric, and Dice similarity and surface\nto surface distance on cortical bone segmentations.\n  Results: The mean absolute error was 63.5 HU on the overall tissue volume and\n144.2 HU on the cortical bone.

In the context of geometrical optics, the\nchange in the physical properties of the signal are related to the refractive\nprofile of the crossed medium. Therefore, having a clear knowledge of how the\nrefractivity governs the photon path and the light time evolution is of prime\nimportance to clearly understand observational features. Analytical studies\nusually focused on spherically symmetric atmospheres and only few aimed at\nexploring the effect of the non-spherical symmetry on the observables.

The\ngeneration mechanism of zonal jets is displayed from the secondary instability\nanalysis via nonlinear interactions with a background base state. Strong\nexponential growth in the zonal modes is induced due to a non-zonal drift wave\nbase state in the MHM model, while stabilizing damping effect is shown with a\nzonal flow base state.

We demonstrate that heartbeats contain high rates of equal states,\nparticularly the CHF with around 20% equalities, and the distributions of equal\nvalues discriminate the heartbeats at very short data length.

This technology opens access to a new generation of computers in\nwhich data are processed without motion of any real particles like electrons.\nThis leads to a sizable decrease in the accompanying heating losses and,\nconsequently, to lower energy consumption, which is crucial due to the ever\nincreasing demand for computing devices. Moreover, unique properties of spin\nwaves allow for the utilisation of unconventional computing concepts, giving\nthe vision of a significantly faster and more powerful next-generation of\ninformation processing systems.\n  The current review addresses a selection of fundamental topics that form the\nbasis of the magnon-based computing and are of primary importance for the\nfurther development of this concept.

Assuming each product variant is a task to solve, first, a\nshape analysis on data to learn common modes of deformation between tasks is\nmade, and secondly, a mapping between these modes and task descriptions is\nperformed. Ultimately, the present work has two main contributions: 1)\nFormulation of an industrial problem into a ZSL setting where new process\nmodels can be generated for process optimization and 2) the definition of a\nregression problem in the domain of ZSL. For that purpose, a 2-d deep drawing\nsimulated process was used based on data collected from the Abaqus simulator,\nwhere a significant number of process models were collected to test the\neffectiveness of the approach. The obtained results show that is possible to\nlearn new tasks without any available data (both labeled and unlabeled) by\nleveraging information about already existing tasks, allowing to speed up the\ncalibration phase and make a quicker integration of new products into\nmanufacturing systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 11:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-28"}

The candidate, PSR J0337+61, has a period of 94 ms and a DM of 226\npc cm$^{-3}$. We re-observed the source twice with increased sensitivities of\n30% and 50% but did not re-detect it. It thus remains unconfirmed. For our\nother sources we obtain very stringent upper limits of 0.8-3.1 mJy at 150 MHz.\nGenerally we can rule out that the pulsars travelled out of the remnant. From\nthese strict limits we conclude our non-detections towards point-sources and\nPWNe are the result of beaming and propagation effects. Some of the remaining\nSNRs should host a black hole rather than a neutron star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 19:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

This data is accessed over the course of\ndecades often by thousands of analysts and scientists. However, storing these\nvolumes of data for long periods of time is not cost effective and, in some\ncases, practically impossible. We propose to transparently virtualize the\nsimulation data, relaxing the storage requirements by not storing the full\noutput and re-simulating the missing data on demand. We develop SimFS, a file\nsystem interface that exposes a virtualized view of the simulation output to\nthe analysis applications and manages the re-simulations. SimFS monitors the\naccess patterns of the analysis applications in order to (1) decide the data to\nkeep stored for faster accesses and (2) to employ prefetching strategies to\nreduce the access time of missing data. Virtualizing simulation data allows us\nto trade storage for computation: this paradigm becomes similar to traditional\non-disk analysis (all data is stored) or in situ (no data is stored) according\nwith the storage resources that are assigned to SimFS. Overall, by exploiting\nthe growing computing power and relaxing the storage capacity requirements,\nSimFS offers a viable path towards exa-scale simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 11:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-11"}

Therefore, coupling is inimical to gauge-fixing, as usually\nunderstood. This sort of reasoning has led some to declare the coupling of\nsubsystems to be the raison d'\\^etre of gauge. Indeed, while gauge-fixing is\nentirely unproblematic for a single region without boundary, it introduces\narbitrary boundary conditions on the gauge degrees of freedom themselves --\nthese conditions lack a physical interpretation when they are not functionals\nof the original fields. Such arbitrary boundary choices creep into the\ncalculation of charges through Noether's second theorem, muddling the\nassignment of physical charges to local gauge symmetries. The confusion brewn\nby gauge at boundaries is well-known, and must be contended with both\nconceptually and technically. Here I explicate the problems mentioned above and\nillustrate a possible resolution: in a recent series of papers the notion of a\nconnection-form was put forward and implemented in the field-space of gauge\ntheories. Using this tool, a modified version of symplectic geometry -- called\n`horizontal' -- is possible. Independently of boundary conditions, this\nformalism bestows to each region a physically salient, relational notion of\ncharge: the horizontal Noether charge. Meanwhile, as required, the\nconnection-form mediates a peaceful composition of regions, one compatible with\nthe attribution of horizontal Noether charges to each region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 21:05:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-15"}
