The unit cell of the proposed antenna array\nconsists of a dipole antenna and a four-by-four HIS ground. The simulation\nresults show that the proposed antenna array can achieve a wide scanning angle\nof up to 65$^{\\circ}$ in the E-plane with an excellent impedance match and a\nsmall $S11$. Floquet mode analysis is utilized to analyze the active impedance\nand the reflection coefficient. Good agreement is obtained between the\ntheoretical results and the simulations. Using numerical and theoretical\nanalyses, we reveal the mechanism of such excellent wide scanning properties.\nFor the range of small scanning angles, these excellent properties result\nmainly from the special reflection phase of the HIS ground, which can cause the\nmutual coupling between the elements of the real array to be compensated by the\nmutual coupling effect between the real array and the mirror array. For the\nrange of large scanning angles, since the surface wave (SW) mode could be\nresonantly excited by a high-order Floquet mode $\\textrm{TM}_{-1,0}$ from the\narray and since the SW mode could be converted into a leaky wave (LW) mode by\nthe scattering of the array, the radiation field from the LW mode is nearly in\nphase with the direct radiating field from the array. Therefore, with help from\nthe special reflection phase of the HIS and the designed LW mode of the HIS\nground, the antenna array with an HIS ground can achieve wide-angle scanning\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 16:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

Critical to these\nanalyses is a characterization of the detection problem that is presented to\nWillie. Previous work has assumed that the channel distribution information\n(CDI) is known to Alice, hence facilitating her characterization of Willie's\ncapabilities to detect the signal. However, in practice, Willie tends to be\npassive and the environment heterogeneous, implying a lack of signaling\ninterchange between the transmitter and Willie makes it difficult if not\nimpossible for Alice to estimate the CDI exactly and provide covertness\nguarantees. In this paper, we address this issue by developing covert\ncommunication schemes for various assumptions on Alice's imperfect knowledge of\nthe CDI: 1) when the transmitter knows the channel distribution is within some\ndistance of a nominal channel distribution; 2) when only the mean and variance\nof the channel distribution are available at Alice; 3) when Alice knows the\nchannel distribution is complex Gaussian but the variance is unknown. In each\ncase, we formulate new optimization problems to find the power allocations that\nmaximize covert rate subject to a covertness requirement under uncertain CDI.\nMoreover, since Willie faces similar challenges as Alice in estimating the CDI,\nwe investigate two possible assumptions on the knowledge of the CDI at Willie:\n1) CDI is known at Willie, 2) CDI is unknown at Willie.

The photon $v_1$ as a function\nof transverse momentum is found to be non-zero and significantly large.\nHowever, it shows a different nature compared to the elliptic and triangular\nflow parameters. The $v_1$ is found to be completely dominated by QGP radiation\nin the region $1 < p_T < 6$ GeV and contribution from the hadronic phase to\nphoton $v_1$ is only marginal. At $p_T < 2$ GeV, it is negative and it\ndecreases further with smaller values of $p_T$. However, at $p_T > 2 $ GeV,\n$v_1$ is positive and rises slowly with $p_T$.

We apply this\nmethod to whistlers recorded at fifteen ground based stations in the AWDANet\n(Automatic Whistler Detector and Analyzer Network) operating between 2007-2018\nand to located lightning strokes from the WWLLN (World Wide Lightning Location\nNetwork) database. We present the obtained maps of causative lightning and\ntransmission ratios. Our results show that the source region of whistlers\ncorresponding to each ground station is around the magnetic conjugate point of\nthe respective station. The size of the source region is typically less than\n2000 km in radius with a small fraction of sources extending to up to 3500 km.\nThe transmission ratio is maximal at the conjugate point and decreases with\nincreasing distance from it. This conforms to the theory that whistlers\ndetected on the ground propagated in a ducted mode through the plasmasphere and\nthus the lightning strokes of their causative spherics must cluster around the\nfootprint of the ducts in the other hemisphere. Our method applied resolves the\nwhistler excitation region mystery that resulted from correlation-based\nanalysis methods, concerning the source region of whistlers detected in\nDunedin, New Zealand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 18:18:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 12:14:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Fortunately, incorporating\nvehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, motivated by its availability\nin bridging long-range vehicular connectivity, dramatically improves delivery\nopportunity. Nevertheless, the cooperation of V2V and V2I communications, known\nas vehicular-to-everything (V2X) communications, necessitates a specific design\nof multihop routing for enhancing data delivery performance. To address this\nissue, this paper provides a mathematical framework to investigate the data\ndelivery performance in V2X networks in terms of both delivery latency and data\nrate. With theoretical analysis, we formulate a global and a distributed\noptimization problem to maximize the weighted sum of delivery latency and data\nrate. The optimization problems are then solved by convex optimization theory\nand based on the solutions, we propose a global and a distributed multihop\nrouting algorithm to select the optimal route for maximizing the weighted sum.\nThe rigorousness of the proposed algorithms is validated by extensive\nsimulation under a wide range of system parameters and simulation results shed\ninsight on the design of multihop routing algorithm in V2X networks for\nminimizing latency and maximizing data rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 18:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

Although the Markovian approximation can be used when driving is\nsufficiently slow compared with relaxation times in electron tunneling, recent\ndevelopments in nano-spintronic devices show that we need to include\nnon-Markovian effects. In contrast to the one-way-only nature of the spin\ncurrent generation under the Markovian dynamics, we find that the non-Markovian\ndynamics exhibits a temporal backflow of spin, call spin backflow for brevity.\nWe capture the phenomenon by introducing its quantifier, and show that the\nbackflow significantly reduces the amount of spin current when the frequency\nexceeds the relaxation rate. This prevents unphysical divergence of the spin\ncurrent in the high frequency limit that occurs under the Markovian\napproximation.

In\naddition to the equilibrium tidal friction, we incorporate dissipation due to\ndynamical tides that are excited inside the giant planet. Using the method of\nGaussian rings to account for planet-planet interactions, we explore the\nconditions for extreme eccentricity excitation via secular chaos and the\nproperties of hot Jupiters formed in this migration channel. Our calculations\nshow that once the inner planet reaches a sufficiently large eccentricity,\ndynamical tides quickly dissipate the orbital energy, producing an eccentric\nwarm Jupiter, which then decays in semi-major axis through equilibrium tides to\nbecome a hot Jupiter. Dynamical tides help the planet avoid tidal disruption,\nincreasing the chance of forming a hot Jupiter, although not all planets\nsurvive the process. We find that the final orbital periods generally lie in\nthe range of 2-3 days, somewhat shorter than those of the observed hot Jupiter\npopulation.

We\nuse simulations of Earth as an exoplanet to introduce a combination of\nmultiwavelength, multiphase, time-series direct-imaging observations and\naccompanying analyses that may improve the robustness of exoplanet ocean\ndetection by spatially mapping the ocean glint signal. As the planet rotates,\nthe glint spot appears to \"blink\" as Lambertian scattering continents interrupt\nthe specular reflection from the ocean.

We\ninvert these light curves to constrain the longitudinal slice maps and apparent\nalbedo of two surfaces at both quadrature and crescent phase. At crescent\nphase, the retrieved apparent albedo of ocean-bearing longitudinal slices is\nincreased by a factor of 5, compared to the albedo at quadrature phase, due to\nthe contribution from glint.

Here we explore the effects of the size definition\non the distribution of galaxies in the size -- stellar mass plane.\nSpecifically, we consider $r_{20}$ and $r_{80}$, the radii that contain 20% and\n80% of a galaxy's total luminosity, as determined from a Sersic profile fit,\nfor galaxies in the 3D-HST/CANDELS and COSMOS-DASH surveys. These radii are\ncalculated from size catalogs based on a simple calculation assuming a Sersic\nprofile. We find that the size-mass distributions for $r_{20}$ and $r_{80}$ are\nmarkedly different from each other and also from the canonical $r_{50}$\ndistribution. The most striking difference is in the relative sizes of star\nforming and quiescent galaxies at fixed stellar mass. Whereas quiescent\ngalaxies are smaller than star forming galaxies in $r_{50}$, this difference\nnearly vanishes for $r_{80}$. By contrast, the distance between the two\npopulations increases for $r_{20}$. Considering all galaxies in a given stellar\nmass and redshift bin we detect a significant bimodality in the distribution of\n$r_{20}$, with one peak corresponding to star forming galaxies and the other to\nquiescent galaxies. We suggest that different measures of the size are tracing\ndifferent physical processes within galaxies; $r_{20}$ is closely related to\nprocesses controlling the star formation rate of galaxies and $r_{80}$ may be\nsensitive to accretion processes and the relation of galaxies with their halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 19:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Discretization of the linear stability\nproblem results in a generalized eigenvalue problem for the dispersion relation\nthat is solved numerically, which agrees well with the analytical approximation\nobtained from a boundary layer analysis valid at high wavenumbers. Under\ngalvanostatic conditions in which an overlimiting current is applied, in the\nclassical case of zero surface charges, the electric field at the cathode\ndiverges at Sand's time due to electrolyte depletion.

Starting from sparsity, recovery methods\nhave steadily moved towards more complex structures. Emerging machine learning\ntools such as generative functions that are based on neural networks are able\nto learn general complex structures from training data. This makes them\npotentially powerful tools for designing CS algorithms. Consider a desired\nclass of signals $\\cal Q$, ${\\cal Q}\\subset{R}^n$, and a corresponding\ngenerative function $g:{\\cal U}^k\\rightarrow {R}^n$, ${\\cal U}\\subset {R}$,\nsuch that $\\sup_{{\\bf x}\\in {\\cal Q}}\\min_{{\\bf u}\\in{\\cal U}^k}{1\\over\n\\sqrt{n}}\\|g({\\bf u})-{\\bf x}\\|\\leq \\delta$.

It has two major contributions: strain induced geometric and\nelectronic changes. If the geometric factor dominates, like in ordinary metals\nsuch as copper, the elastoresistance is positive and rather small, i.e.\ntypically of order 1. In a few materials, however, changes in electronic\nstructure dominate, which gives rise to larger and even negative values, such\nas (-11) for Bi. Here, we report that the transition metal dichalcogenide\n(TMDC) WTe$_{2}$ is a member of the second group, exhibiting a large and\nnon-monotonic elastoresistance that is about (-20) near 100 K and changes sign\nat low temperatures. We discover that an applied magnetic field has a dramatic\neffect on the elastoresistance in WTe$_{2}$: in the quantum regime at low\ntemperatures, it leads to quantum oscillations of the elastoresistance, that\nranges between (-80) to 120 within a field range of only half a Tesla. In the\nsemiclassical regime at intermediate temperatures, we find that the\nelastoresistance rapidly increases and changes sign in a magnetic field.

The breathing lattice-alternation is characterized\nby the ratio of the nearest-neighbor interaction for large tetrahedra to that\nfor small ones, J'/J. It is found by Monte Carlo simulations that the system\nexhibits a first-order transition into four different types of collinear\nmagnetic ordered states. In the uniform case (J'/J=1), the state realized at\nstronger SLC is cubic-symmetric characterized by the (1/2,1/2,1/2) magnetic\nBragg peaks, while the one at weaker SLC is tetragonal-symmetric characterized\nby the (1,1,0) ones. With increasing the breathing distortion (decreasing\nJ'/J), the ordering pattern of the (1/2,1/2,1/2) state becomes non-cubic with\nits magnetic Bragg reflections almost unchanged, while the (1,1,0) state is\nrobust. The non-cubic state peculiar to the breathing pyrochlores is further\ncategorized into two types. We demonstrate that these two non-cubic orderings\nresult in the massive degeneracy of the ground state and that the associated\nresidual entropy per spin takes characteristic values of k_B ln(4)/16 and k_B\nln(6)/16.

Quantum oscillations\nobserved in the resistivity and the magnetization are usually explained by the\nexistence of the Fermi surface. However, Kondo insulators do not have a Fermi\nsurface and thus should not show quantum oscillations. By performing dynamical\nmean-field calculations for topologically nontrivial Kondo insulators in a\nmagnetic field, we analyze the effect of correlations on the emergence of\nquantum oscillations in narrow-gap topological Kondo insulators and demonstrate\nthat the interplay between correlations and nonlocal hybridization,\nubiquitously occurring in topological Kondo insulators, can lead to observable\nquantum oscillations without the necessity of a Fermi surface. Particularly, we\nshow that correlations make it easier to observe quantum oscillations in the\nmagnetization and the resistivity of the bulk material. The fundamental\nmechanism for these quantum oscillations is a combination of correlation\neffects and Landau levels coming very close to the Fermi energy. We furthermore\ndemonstrate that quantum oscillations in a three-dimensional system can be\nunderstood by analyzing the physics on the two-dimensional planes in the\nmomentum space for which the hybridization in direction of the magnetic field\nvanishes.

For this reason we investigate methods of\ntraining an AV without allowing the agent to explore and instead having a human\nexplorer collect the data. Supervised learning has been explored for AV\ncontrol, but it encounters the issue of the covariate shift. That is, training\ndata collected from an optimal demonstration consists only of the states\ninduced by the optimal control policy, but at runtime, the trained agent may\nencounter a vastly different state distribution with little relevant training\ndata. To mitigate this issue, we have our human explorer make sub-optimal\ndecisions. In order to have our agent not replicate these sub-optimal\ndecisions, supervised learning requires that we either erase these actions, or\nreplace these action with the correct action. Erasing is wasteful and replacing\nis difficult, since it is not easy to know the correct action without driving.\nWe propose an alternate framework that includes continuous scalar feedback for\neach action, marking which actions we should replicate, which we should avoid,\nand how sure we are. Our framework learns continuous control from sub-optimal\ndemonstration and evaluative feedback collected before training. We find that a\nhuman demonstrator can explore sub-optimal states in a safe manner, while still\ngetting enough gradation to benefit learning.

We empirically validate several models\nin the ReNeg framework, testing on lane-following with limited data.

Providing a\ntime series is evenly spaced or can be placed on an evenly spaced grid with\nmissing values, these low-dimensional parametric models can prove very\neffective. We introduce a planet-search algorithm to detect periodic transits\nin the residuals after the application of ARIMA models.

Finally, if a\npreviously identified or simulated sample of planets is available, selected\nscalar features from different stages of the analysis -- the original light\ncurves, ARIMA fits, TCF periodograms, and folded light curves -- can be\ncollectively used with a multivariate classifier to identify promising\ncandidates while efficiently rejecting false alarms.

The approach is a top-down route that enables the late\ntransitional element atom (Zn in the present case) to occupy the A site in the\npre-existing MAX phase structure. Using this replacement reaction between Zn\nelement from molten ZnCl2 and Al element in MAX phase precursors (Ti3AlC2,\nTi2AlC, Ti2AlN, and V2AlC), novel MAX phases Ti3ZnC2, Ti2ZnC, Ti2ZnN, and V2ZnC\nwere synthesized.

The application of decision theory results in\ntreatment rules that compare the expected benefit of treatment given the\npatient's covariates against a treatment threshold.

Efficient data-model integration for complex\nmodels requires surrogate modeling to reduce model evaluation time. However,\nbuilding a surrogate of a large-scale Earth system model (ESM) with many output\nvariables is computationally intensive because it involves a large number of\nexpensive ESM simulations. In this effort, we propose an efficient surrogate\nmethod capable of using a few ESM runs to build an accurate and\nfast-to-evaluate surrogate system of model outputs over large spatial and\ntemporal domains. We first use singular value decomposition to reduce the\noutput dimensions, and then use Bayesian optimization techniques to generate an\naccurate neural network surrogate model based on limited ESM simulation\nsamples. Our machine learning based surrogate methods can build and evaluate a\nlarge surrogate system of many variables quickly. Thus, whenever the quantities\nof interest change such as a different objective function, a new site, and a\nlonger simulation time, we can simply extract the information of interest from\nthe surrogate system without rebuilding new surrogates, which significantly\nsaves computational efforts. We apply the proposed method to a regional\necosystem model to approximate the relationship between 8 model parameters and\n42660 carbon flux outputs. Results indicate that using only 20 model\nsimulations, we can build an accurate surrogate system of the 42660 variables,\nwhere the consistency between the surrogate prediction and actual model\nsimulation is 0.93 and the mean squared error is 0.02.

Relevant properties of magnetized, spinning black holes are summarized\nand their observational expression, within galactic nuclei, in terms of radio\nloudness and Fanaroff-Riley class, is briefly described. The dependence of the\naccretion mode on the rate and manner of the mass supply beyond the black hole\nsphere of influence is also discussed. It is argued that hydromagnetic outflows\nfrom accretion disks are generally expected over as many as six decades of\nradius and that they may be the source of emission line gas. These outflows\ncollimate the relativistic jets which are probably generated in an\nelectromagnetic form but become hydromagnetic as they entrain gas through\nboundary layers where most of the initial nonthermal emission occurs. It is\nproposed that the particle acceleration close to the hole emphasizes the proton\nchannel which allows secondary pairs to be created at far higher energies than\nis possible from direct acceleration. These pairs radiate synchrotron\ngamma-rays which can escape along the jet because the outflow effectively\nshields them from pair-producing, soft photons. Jets are subject to helical\ninstabilities which can tangle their magnetic field and may destroy them. The\njet should become plasma-dominated through intermittent, \"magnetoluminescent\"\nuntangling of the field which causes nonthermal emission all along its length.\nPowerful jets remain supersonic out to the \"hot spots\" at the extremities of\nthe source; weaker jets become subsonic plumes or bubbles.

In this paper, we verify the validity of this impact under selfish\nrouting behavior of drivers in traffic networks with mixed autonomy, i.e.\ntraffic networks with both regular and autonomous vehicles. We consider a\nnonatomic routing game on a network with inelastic (fixed) demands for the set\nof network O/D pairs, and study how replacing a fraction of regular vehicles by\nautonomous vehicles will affect the mobility of the network.

However, as widely used, graph matching that\nincorporates pairwise constraints can be formulated as a quadratic assignment\nproblem (QAP), which is NP-complete and results in intrinsic computational\ndifficulties. In this paper, we present a functional representation for graph\nmatching (FRGM) that aims to provide more geometric insights on the problem and\nreduce the space and time complexities of corresponding algorithms. To achieve\nthese goals, we represent a graph endowed with edge attributes by a linear\nfunction space equipped with a functional such as inner product or metric, that\nhas an explicit geometric meaning. Consequently, the correspondence between\ngraphs can be represented as a linear representation map of that functional.\nSpecifically, we reformulate the linear functional representation map as a new\nparameterization for Euclidean graph matching, which is associative with\ngeometric parameters for graphs under rigid or nonrigid deformations. This\nallows us to estimate the correspondence and geometric deformations\nsimultaneously. The use of the representation of edge attributes rather than\nthe affinity matrix enables us to reduce the space complexity by two orders of\nmagnitudes. Furthermore, we propose an efficient optimization strategy with low\ntime complexity to optimize the objective function. The experimental results on\nboth synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed FRGM can\nachieve state-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 08:46:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-17"}

Grid-based simulations,\nespecially those using the local shearing box approximation, provide a powerful\ntool to study the ensuing nonlinear turbulence. On the other hand, while\nmeshless methods have been widely used in both cosmology, galactic dynamics,\nand planet formation they have not been fully deployed on the MRI problem. We\npresent local unstratified and vertically stratified MRI simulations with two\nmeshless MHD schemes: a recent implementation of SPH MHD (Price2012), and a MFM\nMHD scheme with a constrained gradient divergence cleaning scheme, as\nimplemented in the GIZMO code \\citep{Hopkins2017}. Concerning variants of the\nSPH hydro force formulation we consider both the \"vanilla\" SPH and the PSPH\nvariant included in GIZMO. We find, as expected, that the numerical noise\ninherent in these schemes affects turbulence significantly. A high order\nkernel, free of the pairing instability, is necessary. Both schemes can\nadequately simulate MRI turbulence in unstratified shearing boxes with net\nvertical flux. The turbulence, however, dies out in zero-net-flux unstratified\nboxes, probably due to excessive and numerical dissipation. In zero-net-flux\nvertically stratified simulations, MFM can reproduce the MRI dynamo and its\ncharacteristic butterfly diagram for several tens of orbits before ultimately\ndecaying. In contrast, extremely strong toroidal fields, as opposed to\nsustained turbulence, develop in equivalent simulations using SPH MHD. This\nunphysical state in SPH MHD is likely caused by a combination of excessive\nartificial viscosity, numerical resistivity, and the relatively large residual\nerrors in the divergence of the magnetic field remaining even after cleaning\nprocedures are applied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 09:21:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 11:45:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

However, the vehicular task offloading environment is\ndynamic and uncertain, with fast varying network topologies, wireless channel\nstates and computing workloads. These uncertainties bring extra challenges to\ntask offloading. In this work, we consider the task offloading among vehicles,\nand propose a solution that enables vehicles to learn the offloading delay\nperformance of their neighboring vehicles while offloading computation tasks.\nWe design an adaptive learning-based task offloading (ALTO) algorithm based on\nthe multi-armed bandit (MAB) theory, in order to minimize the average\noffloading delay. ALTO works in a distributed manner without requiring frequent\nstate exchange, and is augmented with input-awareness and occurrence-awareness\nto adapt to the dynamic environment. The proposed algorithm is proved to have a\nsublinear learning regret. Extensive simulations are carried out under both\nsynthetic scenario and realistic highway scenario, and results illustrate that\nthe proposed algorithm achieves low delay performance, and decreases the\naverage delay up to 30% compared with the existing upper confidence bound based\nlearning algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 10:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-17"}

Generating sentence embedding vectors reflecting the\nintrinsic meaning of a sentence is a key factor to achieve an enhanced\nperformance in various NLP tasks such as sentence classification and document\nsummarization. Therefore, various sentence embedding models based on supervised\nand unsupervised learning have been proposed after the advent of researches\nregarding the distributed representation of words. They were evaluated through\nsemantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, which measure the degree of semantic\npreservation of a sentence and neural network-based supervised embedding models\ngenerally yielded state-of-the-art performance. However, these models have a\nlimitation in that they have multiple parameters to update, thereby requiring a\ntremendous amount of labeled training data. In this study, we propose an\nefficient approach that learns a transition matrix that refines a sentence\nembedding vector to reflect the latent semantic meaning of a sentence. The\nproposed method has two practical advantages; (1) it can be applied to any\nsentence embedding method, and (2) it can achieve robust performance in STS\ntasks irrespective of the number of training examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 10:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-17"}

Among the\nintrinsic point defects, Se vacancies (Sevac) have the lowest formation energy\n(disregarding Se adatoms that can be removed with annealing). The defects with\nthe next smallest formation energies (at least 1 eV larger) are SeW (Se\nsubstituting W atoms in an antisite defect), Wvac (W vacancies) and 2Sevac (Se\ndivacancies). All these intrinsic defects have gap states that are not\nspin-polarized. The presence of a graphite substrate does not change the\nformation energies of these defects significantly. For the extrinsic point\ndefects, we focus on O, O2, H, H2 and C interacting with perfect WSe2 and its\nintrinsic point defects. The preferred binding site in perfect WSe2 is the\ninterstitial site for atomic O, H and C. These interstitial defects have no gap\nstates. The gap states of the intrinsic defects are modified by interaction\nwith O, O2, H, H2 and C. In particular, the gap states of Sevac and 2Sevac are\ncompletely removed by interaction with O and O2. This is consistent with the\nsignificantly larger stability of O-related defects compared to H- and\nC-related defects. The preferred binding site for O is Sevac, while that for H\nis SeW. H bonded to SeW results in spin-polarized gap states, which may be\nuseful in defect engineering for spintronics applications. The charge\ntransition levels and ionization energies of these defects are also computed. H\nin the interstitial site is an effective donor, while all the other defects are\ndeep donors or acceptors in isolated WSe2 ML.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 11:36:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-17"}

Our connection goes through\nthe surprising quantum characterization of MA by Bravyi and Terhal. They proved\nthe MA-completeness of the problem of deciding whether the groundenergy of a\nuniform stoquastic local Hamiltonian is zero or inverse polynomial. We show\nthat the gapped version of this problem, i.e. deciding if a given uniform\nstoquastic local Hamiltonian is frustration-free or has energy at least some\nconstant $\\epsilon$, is in NP. Thus, if there exists a gap-amplification\nprocedure for uniform stoquastic Local Hamiltonians (in analogy to the gap\namplification procedure for constraint satisfaction problems in the original\nPCP theorem), then MA = NP (and vice versa). Furthermore, if this gap\namplification procedure exhibits some additional (natural) properties, then P =\nRP. We feel this work opens up a rich set of new directions to explore, which\nmight lead to progress on both quantum PCP and derandomization.\n  We also provide two small side results of potential interest.

For copper the measured rate was\nfound to be a factor of 0.72\\,$\\pm$\\,0.14 lower than the Geant4 predicted rate.\n  An additional simulation was performed using the FLUKA Monte Carlo code. The\nFLUKA predicted rate of detected 2.2\\,MeV neutron capture gammas for lead was\nalso found to be in good agreement with the experimental value. A detailed\ncomparison of muon interactions and neutron production in lead for Geant4 and\nFLUKA revealed large discrepancies in the description of photo-nuclear and\nmuon-nuclear inelastic scattering reactions for muon energies at shallow\nunderground sites. These results suggest that Geant4, when used with Geant4\nrecommended or standard physics lists, underpredicts the neutron production in\nphoto-nuclear inelastic scattering reactions while at the same time it\noverpredicts the neutron production in muon-nuclear inelastic scattering\nreactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 14:20:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2019 15:40:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-04"}

A biophysically detailed\nfinite element (FE) model of LV EM was coupled with a FE-based CFD solver for\nmoving domains using an arbitrary Eulerian-Lagrangian (ALE) formulation. Two\nclinical cases of patients suffering from aortic coarctations (CoA) were built\nand parameterized based on clinical data under pre-treatment conditions. For\none patient case simulations under post-treatment conditions after geometric\nrepair of CoA by a virtual stenting procedure were compared against\npre-treatment results. Numerical stability of the approach was demonstrated by\nanalyzing mesh quality and solver performance under the significantly large\ndeformations of the LV blood pool. Further, computational tractability and\ncompatibility with clinical time scales were investigated by performing strong\nscaling benchmarks up to 1536 compute cores. The overall cost of the entire\nworkflow for building, fitting and executing EMF simulations was comparable to\nthose reported for image-based kinematic models, suggesting that EMF models\nshow potential of evolving into a viable clinical research tool.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 16:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

To analyze the range-delay\nambiguity, one extends the standard SAR formulation and allows both the target\nreflectivity and the image to depend not only on the coordinates, but also on\nthe response delay. However, this still leaves the speckle unaccounted for. Yet\nspeckle is commonly found in SAR images of extended targets, and a statistical\napproach is usually employed to describe it. We have developed a simple model\nof a delayed scatterer by modifying the random function that describes a\nhomogeneous extended scatterer. Our model allows us to obtain a relation\nbetween the deterministic parameters of the target model and statistical\nmoments of the SAR image. We assume a regular shape of the antenna trajectory,\nand our model targets are localized in at least one space-time coordinate; this\npermits analytical formulation for statistical moments of the image. The\nproblem of reconstruction of coordinate-delay reflectivity function is reduced\nto that of discrimination between instantaneous and delayed scatterers; for the\nlatter problem, the maximum likelihood based image processing procedure has\nbeen developed.

Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) launch highly energetic jets sometimes\noutshining their host galaxy. These jets are collimated outflows that have been\naccelerated near a supermassive black hole located at the centre of the galaxy.\nTheir, virtually indispensable, energy reservoir is either due to gravitational\nenergy released from accretion or due to the extraction of kinetic energy from\nthe rotating supermassive black hole itself. In order to channel part of this\nenergy to the jet, though, the presence of magnetic fields is necessary. The\nextent to which these magnetic fields survive in the jet further from the\nlaunching region is under debate. Nevertheless, observations of polarised\nemission and Faraday rotation measure confirm the existence of large scale\nmagnetic fields in jets.\n  Results. Radio emission distributions from the jets with dominant large-scale\nhelical fields show asymmetry across their width. The Faraday rotation\nasymmetry is the same for fields with opposing chirality (handedness). For jets\nwhich are tilted towards the observer the synchrotron emission and fractional\npolarization can distinguish the fields chirality. When viewed either side-on\nor at a Blazar type angle only the fractional polarization can make this\ndistinction. Further this distinction can only be made if the direction of the\njet propagation velocity is known, along with the location of the jet's origin.\nThe complex structure of the braided field is found not to be observable due to\na combination of line of sight integration and limited resolution of\nobservation. This raises the possibility that, even if asymmetric radio\nemission signatures are present, the true structure of the field may still be\nobscure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 21:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-22"}

The feature selection methods make it possible to solve this\nproblem; however, the method selection is still under investigation to find out\nwhich feature can perform the best to extract the most proper features of the\nsignal to improve the classification performance. In this study, we use the\ngenetic algorithm (GA), a heuristic searching algorithm, to find the optimum\ncombination of the feature extraction methods and the classifiers, in the\nbrain-computer interface (BCI) applications. A BCI system can be practical if\nand only if it performs with high accuracy and high speed alongside each other.\nIn the proposed method, GA performs as a searching engine to find the best\ncombination of the features and classifications. The features used here are\nKatz, Higuchi, Petrosian, Sevcik, and box-counting dimension (BCD) feature\nextraction methods. These features are applied to the wavelet subbands and are\nclassified with four classifiers such as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system\n(ANFIS), fuzzy k-nearest neighbors (FKNN), support vector machine (SVM) and\nlinear discriminant analysis (LDA). Due to the huge number of features, the GA\noptimization is used to find the features with the optimum fitness value (FV).\nResults reveal that Katz fractal feature estimation method with LDA\nclassification has the best FV. Consequently, due to the low computation time\nof the first Daubechies wavelet transformation in comparison to the original\nsignal, the final selected methods contain the fractal features of the first\ncoefficient of the detail subbands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 05:31:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-07"}

There are cases\nin which an adversary can strategically tamper with the input data to affect\nthe outcome of the learning process. While some datasets are difficult to\nattack, many others are susceptible to manipulation. A resourceful attacker can\ntamper with large portions of the dataset and affect them. An attacker can\nadditionally strategically focus on a preferred subset of the attributes in the\ndataset to maximize the effectiveness of the attack and minimize the resources\nallocated to data manipulation. In light of this vulnerability, we introduce a\nsolution according to which the defender implements an array of learners, and\ntheir activation is performed strategically. The defender computes the (game\ntheoretic) strategy space and accordingly applies a dominant strategy where\npossible, and a Nash-stable strategy otherwise. In this paper we provide the\ndetails of this approach.
