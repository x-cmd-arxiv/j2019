It was recently shown that TRMRC outperforms FDMRC\nin terms of achievable rates, since SC systems do not require the cyclic prefix\n(CP) of OFDM. On the other hand, the computational complexity of TRMRC\nalgorithm is higher than that of FDMRC, even when efficient solutions are\nemployed (e.g., fast convolution with the overlap-and-add method). Hence, the\nbest scheme for the UL maMIMO systems still remains an open question. The main\ncontribution of this paper is the comparison of the total energy efficiency of\nboth TRMRC and FDMRC when used in the UL of maMIMO systems. Our results show\nthat, for current typical system parameters, FDMRC/OFDM achieves a higher total\nenergy efficiency than TRMRC/SC.

However,\nthe security aspects of machine learning in wireless applications have not been\nwell understood yet. We consider the case that a cognitive transmitter senses\nthe spectrum and transmits on idle channels determined by a machine learning\nalgorithm. We present an adversarial machine learning approach to launch a\nspectrum data poisoning attack by inferring the transmitter's behavior and\nattempting to falsify the spectrum sensing data over the air. For that purpose,\nthe adversary transmits for a short period of time when the channel is idle to\nmanipulate the input for the decision mechanism of the transmitter. The\ncognitive engine at the transmitter is a deep neural network model that\npredicts idle channels with minimum sensing error for data transmissions. The\ntransmitter collects spectrum sensing data and uses it as the input to its\nmachine learning algorithm. In the meantime, the adversary builds a cognitive\nengine using another deep neural network model to predict when the transmitter\nwill have a successful transmission based on its spectrum sensing data. The\nadversary then performs the over-the-air spectrum data poisoning attack, which\naims to change the channel occupancy status from idle to busy when the\ntransmitter is sensing, so that the transmitter is fooled into making incorrect\ntransmit decisions. This attack is more energy efficient and harder to detect\ncompared to jamming of data transmissions. We show that this attack is very\neffective and reduces the throughput of the transmitter substantially.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2019 17:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

We find novel features such as amplifying\nthe Rabi frequency of one atom, together with strong Rydberg-Rydberg\ninteractions freezes the dynamics in the second atom. We characterize the\nRydberg-biased freezing phenomenon in detail, with effective Hamiltonians\nobtained for various limits of the system parameters. In the absence of\nRabi-offset, the doubly excited state population exhibits a Lorentzian profile\nas a function of interaction, whereas for very small offsets it shows splitting\nand thus peaks. Using an effective Hamiltonian as well as the perturbation\ntheory for weak interactions, we show that the peak arises from a competition\nbetween Rabi-offset and Rydberg-Rydberg interactions when both are sufficiently\nsmall, together with the Rydberg blockade at large interactions. The effective\nHamiltonians provide us with analytical results which are in an excellent\nagreement with full numerical solutions.

Despite the recent experimental successes, a predictive model to\ndescribe the detection event in these detectors is needed to optimize the\ndetection metrics. Here, we propose a probabilistic criterion for single-photon\ndetection based on single-vortex (flux quanta) crossing the width of the\nnanowire. Our model makes a connection between the dark-counts and\nphoton-counts near the detection threshold. The finite-difference calculations\ndemonstrate that a change in the bias current distribution as a result of the\nphoton absorption significantly increases the probability of single-vortex\ncrossing even if the vortex potential barrier has not vanished completely. We\nestimate the instrument response function and show that the timing uncertainty\nof this vortex tunneling process corresponds to a fundamental limit in timing\njitter of the click event. We demonstrate a trade-space between this intrinsic\n(quantum) timing jitter, quantum efficiency, and dark count rate in TaN, WSi,\nand NbN superconducting nanowires at different experimental conditions. Our\ndetection model can also explain the experimental observation of exponential\ndecrease in the quantum efficiency of SNSPDs at lower energies. This leads to a\npulse-width dependency in the quantum efficiency, and it can be further used as\nan experimental test to compare across different detection models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2019 23:50:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Feb 2019 02:31:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 05:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

Previous studies have demonstrated that the convergence rate of\nSA can be improved by introducing either smoothness or strong convexity\ncondition. In this paper, we make use of smoothness and strong convexity\nsimultaneously to boost the convergence rate. Let $\\lambda$ be the modulus of\nstrong convexity, $\\kappa$ be the condition number, $F_*$ be the minimal risk,\nand $\\alpha>1$ be some small constant. First, we demonstrate that, in\nexpectation, an $O(1/[\\lambda T^\\alpha] + \\kappa F_*/T)$ risk bound is\nattainable when $T = \\Omega(\\kappa^\\alpha)$. Thus, when $F_*$ is small, the\nconvergence rate could be faster than $O(1/[\\lambda T])$ and approaches\n$O(1/[\\lambda T^\\alpha])$ in the ideal case. Second, to further benefit from\nsmall risk, we show that, in expectation, an $O(1/2^{T/\\kappa}+F_*)$ risk bound\nis achievable. Thus, the excess risk reduces exponentially until reaching\n$O(F_*)$, and if $F_*=0$, we obtain a global linear convergence. Finally, we\nemphasize that our proof is constructive and each risk bound is equipped with\nan efficient stochastic algorithm attaining that bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jan 2019 09:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

This is a\nparticular issue when automatic processing tools, e.g. image segmentation\nmethods, are employed to derive quantitative measures or biomarkers for later\nanalyses. Manual inspection and visual QC of each segmentation isn't feasible\nat large scale. However, it's important to be able to automatically detect when\na segmentation method fails so as to avoid inclusion of wrong measurements into\nsubsequent analyses which could lead to incorrect conclusions. Methods: To\novercome this challenge, we explore an approach for predicting segmentation\nquality based on Reverse Classification Accuracy, which enables us to\ndiscriminate between successful and failed segmentations on a per-cases basis.\nWe validate this approach on a new, large-scale manually-annotated set of 4,800\ncardiac magnetic resonance scans. We then apply our method to a large cohort of\n7,250 cardiac MRI on which we have performed manual QC. Results: We report\nresults used for predicting segmentation quality metrics including Dice\nSimilarity Coefficient (DSC) and surface-distance measures. As initial\nvalidation, we present data for 400 scans demonstrating 99% accuracy for\nclassifying low and high quality segmentations using predicted DSC scores. As\nfurther validation we show high correlation between real and predicted scores\nand 95% classification accuracy on 4,800 scans for which manual segmentations\nwere available. We mimic real-world application of the method on 7,250 cardiac\nMRI where we show good agreement between predicted quality metrics and manual\nvisual QC scores. Conclusions: We show that RCA has the potential for accurate\nand fully automatic segmentation QC on a per-case basis in the context of\nlarge-scale population imaging as in the UK Biobank Imaging Study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jan 2019 10:52:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

These closures were pioneered by Hammett and Perkins and\nallow for the rigorous incorporation of collisionless Landau damping into a\nfluid framework. It is Landau damping that sharply separates traditional fluid\nmodels and collisionless kinetic theory, and is the main reason why the usual\nfluid models do not converge to the kinetic description, even in the\nlong-wavelength low-frequency limit. We start with a brief introduction to\nkinetic theory, where we discuss in detail the plasma dispersion function\n$Z(\\zeta)$, and the associated plasma response function $R(\\zeta)=1+\\zeta\nZ(\\zeta)=-Z'(\\zeta)/2$. We then consider a 1D (electrostatic) geometry and make\na significant effort to map all possible Landau fluid closures that can be\nconstructed at the 4th-order moment level. These closures for parallel moments\nhave general validity from the largest astrophysical scales down to the Debye\nlength, and we verify their validity by considering examples of the (proton and\nelectron) Landau damping of the ion-acoustic mode, and the electron Landau\ndamping of the Langmuir mode. We proceed by considering 1D closures at\nhigher-order moments than the 4th-order, and as was concluded in Part 1, this\nis not possible without Landau fluid closures. We show that it is possible to\nreproduce linear Landau damping in the fluid framework to any desired\nprecision, thus showing the convergence of the fluid and collisionless kinetic\ndescriptions. We then consider a 3D (electromagnetic) geometry in the\ngyrotropic (long-wavelength low-frequency) limit and map all closures that are\navailable at the 4th-order moment level.

We investigate how properties of the ensemble of superclusters in the\ncosmic web evolve with time. Methods. We perform numerical simulations of the\nevolution of the cosmic web using the LambdaCDM model in box sizes L0 = 1024,\n512, 256 Mpc/h. We find supercluster ensembles of models for four evolutionary\nstages, corresponding to the present epoch z = 0, and to redshifts z = 1, z =\n3, and z = 10. We calculate fitness diameters of superclusters defined from\nvolumes of superclusters divided to filling factors of over-density regions.\nGeometrical and fitness diameters of largest superclusters, and the number of\nsuperclusters as functions of the threshold density are used as percolation\nfunctions to describe geometrical properties of the ensemble of superclusters\nin the cosmic web. We calculate distributions of geometrical and fitness\ndiameters and luminosities of superclusters, and follow time evolution of\npercolation functions and supercluster distributions. We compare percolation\nfunctions and supercluster distributions of models and samples of galaxies of\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Results. Our analysis shows that fitness\ndiameters of superclusters have a minimum at certain threshold density. Fitness\ndiameters around minima almost do not change with time in co-moving\ncoordinates. Numbers of superclusters have maxima which are approximately\nconstant for all evolutionary epochs. Geometrical diameters of superclusters\ndecrease during the evolution of the cosmic web; luminosities of superclusters\nincrease during the evolution. Conclusions. Our study suggests that\nevolutionary changes occur inside dynamical volumes of superclusters. The\nstability of fitness diameters and numbers of superclusters during the\nevolution is an important property of the cosmic web.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jan 2019 14:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

It is of vital importance to accelerate\nflash calculation without much compromise in accuracy and reliability, turning\nit into an active research topic in the last two decades. In this study, we\nestablish a deep neural network model to approximate the iterative NVT-flash\ncalculation. A dynamic model designed for NVT flash problems is iteratively\nsolved to produce data for training the neural network. In order to test the\nmodel's capacity to handle complex fluid mixtures, three real reservoir fluids\nare investigated, including one Bakken oil and two Eagle Ford oils. Compared to\nprevious studies that follow the conventional flash framework in which\nstability testing precedes phase splitting calculation, we incorporate\nstability test and phase split calculation together and accomplish both two\nsteps by a single deep learning model. The trained model is able to identify\nthe single vapor, single liquid and vapor-liquid state under the subcritical\nregion of the investigated fluids. A number of examples are presented to show\nthe accuracy and efficiency of the proposed deep neural network. It is found\nthat the trained model makes predictions at most 244 times faster than the\niterative flash calculation under the given cases. Even though training a\nmulti-level network model does take a large amount of time that is comparable\nto the computational time of flash calculations, the one-time offline training\nprocess gives the deep learning model great potential to speed up compositional\nreservoir simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jan 2019 14:08:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

Despite the long history of the Principle, its\nfundamental rationale and proper interpretation remain frequently\nmisunderstood. Contrary to some misinterpretations of the Principle, the mere\ntransfer of entropy between computational and non-computational subsystems can\noccur in a thermodynamically reversible way without increasing total entropy.\nHowever, Landauer's Principle is not about general entropy transfers; rather,\nit more specifically concerns the ejection of (all or part of) some correlated\ninformation from a controlled, digital form (e.g., a computed bit) to an\nuncontrolled, non-computational form, i.e., as part of a thermal environment.\nAny uncontrolled thermal system will, by definition, continually re-randomize\nthe physical information in its thermal state, from our perspective as\nobservers who cannot predict the exact dynamical evolution of the microstates\nof such environments. Thus, any correlations involving information that is\nejected into and subsequently thermalized by the environment will be lost from\nour perspective, resulting directly in an irreversible increase in total\nentropy. Avoiding the ejection and thermalization of correlated computational\ninformation motivates the reversible computing paradigm, although the\nrequirements for computations to be thermodynamically reversible are less\nrestrictive than frequently described, particularly in the case of stochastic\ncomputational operations. There are interesting possibilities for the design of\ncomputational processes that utilize stochastic, many-to-one computational\noperations while nevertheless avoiding net entropy increase that remain to be\nfully explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2019 18:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

A substantial body of researches use\nPearson's correlation coefficients, mutual information, or partial correlation\nto investigate the differences in brain connectivities between ASD and typical\ncontrols from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). However,\ncorrelation or partial correlation does not directly reveal causal influences -\nthe information flow - between brain regions.

The\nelectronic bandgap of these materials are 1.9 eV, 1.42 eV, 1.08 eV and 0.55 eV\nrespectively. This novel III-V arrangement enables the cell to absorb photons\nfrom the ultraviolet to deep infrared wavelengths of the solar spectrum. After\ncareful consideration of important semiconductor parameters such as thicknesses\nof emitter and base layers, doping concentrations, diffusion lengths, minority\ncarrier lifetimes and surface recombination velocities an optimized quadruple\njunction design has been suggested. Current matching of the subcell layers was\nensured to obtain maximum efficiency from the proposed design. The\nshort-circuit current density, open circuit voltage and fill factor of the\nsolar cell are 14.7 mA/cm2, 3.3731 V and 0.9553 respectively. In the design\nprocess, 1 sun AM1.5 global solar spectrum was considered. The cell performance\nwas also investigated for extraterrestrial illumination (AM0). A modified\ndesign is proposed for space applications. With a short circuit current density\nof 18.5 mA/cm2, open circuit voltage of 3.4104 and the fill factor of 0.9557,\nthe power conversion efficiency of the modified quadruple junction design is\n44.5473% in space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2019 16:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-20"}
