In this work, this\nproblem is studied through the lens of compression which is captured by the\nlow-rank structure of weight matrices. It is first shown that adversarial\ntraining tends to promote simultaneously low-rank and sparse structure in the\nweight matrices of neural networks. This is measured through the notions of\neffective rank and effective sparsity. In the reverse direction, when the low\nrank structure is promoted by nuclear norm regularization and combined with\nsparsity inducing regularizations, neural networks show significantly improved\nadversarial robustness.

Network utility maximization (NUM) is a general framework for\nachieving fair, efficient, and cost-effective sharing of constrained network\nresources. When agents have asymmetric and private information, however, a\nfundamental economic challenge is how to solve the NUM Problem considering the\nself-interests of strategic agents. Many previous related works have proposed\neconomic mechanisms that can cope with agents' private utilities. However, the\nnetwork sharing paradigm introduces the issue of information asymmetries\nregarding constraints. The related literature largely neglected such an issue;\nlimited closely related studies provided solutions only applicable to specific\napplication scenarios. To tackle these issues, we propose the Decomposable NUM\n(DeNUM) Mechanism and the Dynamic DeNUM (DyDeNUM) Mechanism, the first\nmechanisms in the literature for solving NUM Problems considering private\nutility and constraint information. The key idea of both mechanisms is to\ndecentralize the decision process to agents, who will make resource allocation\ndecisions without the need of revealing private information to others. Under a\nmonitorable influence assumption, the DeNUM Mechanism yields the\nnetwork-utility maximizing solution at an equilibrium, and achieves other\ndesirable economic properties (such as individual rationality and budget\nbalance). We further establish the connection between the equilibrium structure\nand the primal-dual solution to a related optimization problem, based on which\nwe prove the convergence of the DeNUM Algorithm to an equilibrium. When the\nagents' influences are not monitorable, we propose the DyDeNUM Mechanism that\nyields the network-utility maximizing solution at the cost of the balanced\nbudget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 16:54:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 13:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-08"}

Although (i) is more\ndescriptive than (ii), it also produces a considerable amount of insensitivity\nfor certain sets. Since the quantifier {\\em most} has a solid cardinal\nbehaviour under the interpretation {\\em majority} and has a slightly more\nstatistical behaviour under the interpretation {\\em proportional of}, we\nconsider an alternative approach in deciding quantity-related statements\nregarding infinite sets. For this we introduce a new semantics using {\\em\nnatural density} for sentences in which interpretations of their nouns are\ninfinite subsets of $ \\mathbb{N} $, along with a list of the axiomatization of\nthe concept of natural density. In other words, we take the standard definition\nof the semantics of \\textit{most} but define it as applying to finite\napproximations of infinite sets computed to the limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 17:00:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 07:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-15"}

The Tc of under-doped Bi2201 initially increases from 9.6\nK at ambient to a peak at ~ 23 K at ~ 26 GPa and then drops as expected from\nthe universal Tc-P relation.

As the solution space is often the dual of the\ndata space in PDEs, the analogous concept of feature space and data space\n(which are dual to each other) is introduced in CNN. With such connections and\nnew concept in the unified model, the function of various convolution\noperations and pooling used in CNN can be better understood. As a result,\nmodified CNN models (with fewer weights and hyper parameters) are developed\nthat exhibit competitive and sometimes better performance in comparison with\nexisting CNN models when applied to both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 17:30:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 May 2019 20:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-10"}

After a short discussion of these notions in the context of a\nsimple toy model, they are defined in general terms.

Existing matrix completion models generally follow either a memory- or\na model-based approach, whereas, geometric matrix completion models combine the\nbest from both approaches. Existing deep-learning-based geometric models yield\ngood performance, but, in order to operate, they require a fixed structure\ngraph capturing the relationships among the users and items. This graph is\ntypically constructed by evaluating a pre-defined similarity metric on the\navailable observations or by using side information, e.g., user profiles. In\ncontrast, Markov-random-fields-based models do not require a fixed structure\ngraph but rely on handcrafted features to make predictions. When no side\ninformation is available and the number of available observations becomes very\nlow, existing solutions are pushed to their limits. In this paper, we propose a\ngeometric matrix completion approach that addresses these challenges.

The goal is to create systems that accurately detect,\nrecognize, verify, and understand human faces. There are significant technical\nhurdles in making these systems accurate, particularly in unconstrained\nsettings due to confounding factors related to pose, resolution, illumination,\nocclusion, and viewpoint. However, with recent advances in neural networks,\nface recognition has achieved unprecedented accuracy, largely built on\ndata-driven deep learning methods. While this is encouraging, a critical aspect\nthat is limiting facial recognition accuracy and fairness is inherent facial\ndiversity. Every face is different. Every face reflects something unique about\nus. Aspects of our heritage - including race, ethnicity, culture, geography -\nand our individual identify - age, gender, and other visible manifestations of\nself-expression, are reflected in our faces. We expect face recognition to work\nequally accurately for every face. Face recognition needs to be fair. As we\nrely on data-driven methods to create face recognition technology, we need to\nensure necessary balance and coverage in training data. However, there are\nstill scientific questions about how to represent and extract pertinent facial\nfeatures and quantitatively measure facial diversity. Towards this goal,\nDiversity in Faces (DiF) provides a data set of one million annotated human\nface images for advancing the study of facial diversity. The annotations are\ngenerated using ten well-established facial coding schemes from the scientific\nliterature. The facial coding schemes provide human-interpretable quantitative\nmeasures of facial features. We believe that by making the extracted coding\nschemes available on a large set of faces, we can accelerate research and\ndevelopment towards creating more fair and accurate facial recognition systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 18:24:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 15:38:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 15:26:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 16 Feb 2019 17:17:08 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 22:51:46 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 21:27:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

Our approach offers two benefits compared to the state of the\nart. First, we offer a blueprint for modeling of user attention. Rather than\nassuming a logarithmic loss in importance as a function of the rank, we can\naccount for varying user behaviors through parametrization. For example, we\nexpect a user to see more items during a viewing of a social media feed than\nwhen they inspect the results list of a single web search query. Second, we\nallow non-binary protected attributes to enable investigating inherently\ncontinuous attributes (\\eg political alignment on the liberal to conservative\nspectrum) as well as to facilitate measurements across aggregated sets of\nsearch results, rather than separately for each result list. By combining these\ntwo elements into our metric, we are able to better address the human factors\ninherent in this problem. We measure the whole sociotechnical system,\nconsisting of a ranking algorithm and individuals using it, instead of\nexclusively focusing on the ranking algorithm. Finally, we use our metric to\nperform three simulated fairness audits.

Our rBOSS is a de\nBruijn graph in practice, but it simulates any length up to k and can compute\noverlaps of size at least m between the labels of the nodes, with k and m being\nparameters. If we choose the parameter k equal to the size of the reads, then\nwe can simulate a complete string graph. As most BWT-based structures, rBOSS is\nunidirectional, but it exploits the property of the DNA reverse complements to\nsimulate bi-directionality with some time-space trade-offs. We implemented a\ngenome assembler on top of rBOSS to demonstrate its usefulness. Our\nexperimental results show that using k = 100, rBOSS can assemble 185 MB of\nreads in less than 15 minutes and using 110 MB in total. It produces contigs of\nmean sizes over 10,000, which is twice the size obtained by using a pure de\nBruijn graph of fixed length k.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 18:57:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 13:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-02"}

This mechanism requires composite top\npartners which are relatively light compared to the typical mass scale of the\nstrongly coupled theory. While most studies of the phenomenology of such models\nhave focused on a bottom-up approach with a minimal effective theory, a\ntop-down approach suggests that that the theory should contain a limit in which\nan unbroken global chiral symmetry protects the mass of the top partners, and\nthe spectrum of the partners satisfies `t Hooft matching conditions. We\ntherefore consider a model for the UV gauge group which could provide a\nsolution to the matching conditions, and note that the relatively light\nfermions and pseudo-Goldstone bosons fall into complete multiplets of a large\napproximate global symmetry. This implies that the spectrum of particles\nlighter than a few TeV is non-minimal. Our example illustrates likely features\nof a composite Higgs theory, and also serves as an example of a non-chiral\ntheory with no sign problem and a possible solution to `t Hooft matching\nconditions. It would therefore be very interesting for a lattice exploration.\nWe find in this example that for some low-energy parameters in the effective\ntheory the top partners can decay into high multiplicity final states, which\ncould be difficult for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to constrain.

In practice, this places a limit on the number of objects, n,\nthat can be tracked at the same time.

Due to the fast stellar velocity and the high\nambient temperature, the wind is thought to form a comet-like tail, similar to\nMira in the Local Bubble. Many massive elliptical galaxies and cluster central\ngalaxies host extended dusty cold filaments. The fate of the cold dusty stellar\nwind and its relation to cold filaments are not well understood. In this work,\nwe carry out both analytical and numerical studies of the interaction between\nan AGB wind and the surrounding hot gas. We find that the cooling time of the\ntail is inversely proportional to the ambient pressure. In the absence of\ncooling, or in low pressure environments (e.g., the outskirts of elliptical\ngalaxies), AGB winds are quickly mixed into the hot gas, and all the AGB winds\nhave similar appearance and head-to-tail ratio. In high pressure environments,\nsuch as the Local Bubble and the central regions of massive elliptical\ngalaxies, some of the gas in the mixing layer between the stellar wind and the\nsurrounding hot gas can cool efficiently and cause the tail to become longer.\nOur simulated tail of Mira itself has similar length and velocity to that\nobserved, and appears similar to the simulated AGB tail in the central regions\nof massive galaxies. We speculate that instead of thermal instability, the\ninduced condensation at the mixing layer of AGB winds may be the origin of cold\nfilaments in massive galaxies and galaxy clusters.

In particular, we study models harboring fracton order, both type-I\nand type-II, and compare the resulting ES with that of both conventional\ntopological order and of (strong) subsystem symmetry protected topological\n(SSPT) states. We find that non-local surface stabilizers (NLSS), a set of\nsymmetries of the Hamiltonian which form on the boundary of the entanglement\ncut, act as purveyors of universal non-local features appearing in the\nentanglement spectrum. While in conventional topological orders and fracton\norders, the NLSS retain a form of topological invariance with respect to the\nentanglement cut, subsystem symmetric systems---fracton and SSPT\nphases---additionally show a non-trivial geometric dependence on the\nentanglement cut, corresponding to the subsystem symmetry. This sheds further\nlight on the interplay between geometric and topological effects in fracton\nphases of matter and demonstrates that strong SSPT phases harbour a measure of\nquasi-local entanglement beyond that encountered in conventional SPT phases.

The\ndifferences between the deterministic and random fractal structures in\nanalyzing SAS data are emphasized. Several limitations are identified in order\nto motivate future investigations of deterministic fractal structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

In many graph\nsignal processing settings, it is important to transfer a filter from one graph\nto another. One example is in graph convolutional neural networks (ConvNets),\nwhere the dataset consists of signals defined on many different graphs, and the\nlearned filters should generalize to signals on new graphs, not present in the\ntraining set. A necessary condition for transferability (the ability to\ntransfer filters) is stability. Namely, given a graph filter, if we add a small\nperturbation to the graph, then the filter on the perturbed graph is a small\nperturbation of the original filter. It is a common misconception that spectral\nfilters are not stable, and this paper aims at debunking this mistake. We\nintroduce a space of filters, called the Cayley smoothness space, that contains\nthe filters of state-of-the-art spectral filtering methods, and whose filters\ncan approximate any generic spectral filter. For filters in this space, the\nperturbation in the filter is bounded by a constant times the perturbation in\nthe graph, and filters in the Cayley smoothness space are thus termed linearly\nstable. By combining stability with the known property of equivariance, we\nprove that graph spectral filters are transferable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-31"}

A\nsimilar extended feature, however, is not detected on the NE side, which is\nbrighter in all other wavelengths such as radio, H$\\alpha$, and soft X-ray.\nScattered photons from the nuclear region or other nearby point-like X-ray\nbright sources, inverse Compton emission from cosmic ray electrons via\ninteraction with the cosmic microwave background, or any individually faint\nstellar X-ray source populations, cannot explain the extended hard X-ray\nemission on the SW side and the strongly NE/SW asymmetry. A synchrotron\nemission model, plus a thermal component accounting for the excess at\n$\\sim1\\rm~keV$, can well characterize the broadband radio/hard X-ray spectra.\nThe broadband synchrotron spectra do not show any significant cutoff, and even\npossibly slightly flatten at higher energy. This rules out a loss-limited\nscenario in the acceleration of the cosmic ray electrons in or around this\nsuperbubble. As the first detection of kpc-scale extended hard X-ray emission\nassociated with a galactic nuclear superbubble, the spatial and spectral\nproperties of the multi-wavelength emissions indicate that the cosmic ray\nleptons responsible for the broad-band synchrotron emission from the SW bubble\nmust be accelerated in situ, instead of transported from the nuclear region of\nthe galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

Recently, the loss surfaces of\ndeep neural networks have been explored to gain insight into outstanding\nquestions in optimization, generalization, and network architecture design.\nHowever, the degree to which recently-proposed methods for numerically\nrecovering critical points actually do so has not been thoroughly evaluated. In\nthis paper, we examine this issue in a case for which the ground truth is\nknown: the deep linear autoencoder. We investigate two sub-problems associated\nwith numerical critical point identification: first, because of large parameter\ncounts, it is infeasible to find all of the critical points for contemporary\nneural networks, necessitating sampling approaches whose characteristics are\npoorly understood; second, the numerical tolerance for accurately identifying a\ncritical point is unknown, and conservative tolerances are difficult to\nsatisfy. We first identify connections between recently-proposed methods and\nwell-understood methods in other fields, including chemical physics, economics,\nand algebraic geometry. We find that several methods work well at recovering\ncertain information about loss surfaces, but fail to take an unbiased sample of\ncritical points. Furthermore, numerical tolerance must be very strict to ensure\nthat numerically-identified critical points have similar properties to true\nanalytical critical points. We also identify a recently-published Newton method\nfor optimization that outperforms previous methods as a critical point-finding\nalgorithm.

Such smart codes make road sign\nclassification problem aligned with communication settings more than\nconventional classification. This enables us to integrate well-established\nresults in communication theory, e.g., error-correction methods, into road sign\nclassification problem. Recently, vision-based road sign classification\nalgorithms have been shown to be vulnerable against (even) small scale\nadversarial interventions that are imperceptible for humans. On the other hand,\nsmart codes constructed via error-correction methods can lead to robustness\nagainst small scale intelligent or random perturbations on them.

For the proof we use a connection,\nestablished in Raz [Ra], between the notion of graph rigidity and\nconfigurations of lines in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.

They allow to\ndeal with quantum transport phenomena and are an advanced tool for constructing\nnovel quantum algorithms. Quantum walks on graphs are fundamentally different\nfrom classical random walks analogs, in particular, they walk faster than\nclassical ones on certain graphs, enabling in these cases quantum algorithmic\napplications and quantum-enhanced energy transfer. However, little is known\nabout the possible advantages on arbitrary graphs not having explicit\nsymmetries. For these graphs one would need to perform simulations of classical\nand quantum walk dynamics to check if the speedup occurs, which could take a\nlong computational time. Here we present a new approach for the solution of the\nquantum speedup problem, which is based on a machine learning algorithm that\npredicts the quantum advantage by just looking at a graph. The convolutional\nneural network, which we designed specifically to learn from graphs, observes\nsimulated examples and learns complex features of graphs that lead to a quantum\nadvantage, allowing to identify graphs that exhibit quantum advantage without\nperforming any quantum walk or random walk simulations. The performance of our\napproach is evaluated for line and random graphs, where classification was\nalways better than random guess even for the most challenging cases.

The most likely reason is the natural gap between the\ntraining and testing of re-ID networks, that is, the predictions of a re-ID\nnetwork cannot be directly used during testing without an effective metric. In\nthis work, we bridge the gap by proposing Adversarial Metric Attack, a parallel\nmethodology to adversarial classification attacks. Comprehensive experiments\nclearly reveal the adversarial effects in re-ID systems. Meanwhile, we also\npresent an early attempt of training a metric-preserving network, thereby\ndefending the metric against adversarial attacks. At last, by benchmarking\nvarious adversarial settings, we expect that our work can facilitate the\ndevelopment of adversarial attack and defense in metric-based applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 02:41:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Mar 2019 04:23:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2020 14:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

Since\nstatistic properties of different views are diverse, even incompatible, few\napproaches implement multi-view clustering based on the concatenated features\nstraightforward. However, feature concatenation is a natural way to combine\nmulti-view data. To this end, this paper proposes a novel multi-view subspace\nclustering approach dubbed Feature Concatenation Multi-view Subspace Clustering\n(FCMSC), which boosts the clustering performance by exploring the consensus\ninformation of multi-view data. Specifically, multi-view data are concatenated\ninto a joint representation firstly, then, $l_{2,1}$-norm is integrated into\nthe objective function to deal with the sample-specific and cluster-specific\ncorruptions of multiple views. Moreover, a graph regularized FCMSC is also\nproposed in this paper to explore both the consensus information and\ncomplementary information of multi-view data for clustering. It is noteworthy\nthat the obtained coefficient matrix is not derived by simply applying the\nLow-Rank Representation (LRR) to concatenated features directly.

In these oligocrystals the differences in stress response\ndue to microstructural variation is pronounced. Shell-like structures produced\nby metal-based additive manufacturing and the like make the prediction of the\nbehavior of oligocrystals technologically relevant. The predictions of\ntraditional homogenization theories based on grain volumes are not sensitive to\nvariations in local grain neighborhoods. Direct simulation of the local\nresponse with crystal plasticity finite element methods is more detailed, but\nthe computations are expensive. To represent the stress-strain response of a\npolycrystalline sample given its initial grain texture and morphology we have\ndesigned a novel neural network that incorporates a convolution component to\nobserve and reduce the information in the crystal texture field and a recursive\ncomponent to represent the causal nature of the history information.

The\nfirst challenge stems from the pursuit of high throughput, which prohibits the\ndeployment of inseparable architectures, and hence greatly limits the model\naccuracy. The second problem arises from the heavy dependency on human provided\nlabels, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect, yet how to leverage\nunlabeled search log data is rarely studied. The proposed training framework\ntargets on mitigating both issues, by treating the stronger but undeployable\nmodels as annotators, and learning a deployable model from both human provided\nrelevance labels and weakly annotated search log data. Specifically, we first\nconstruct multiple auxiliary tasks from the enumerated relevance labels, and\ntrain the annotators by jointly learning from those related tasks. The\nannotation models are then used to assign scores to both labeled and unlabeled\ntraining samples. The deployable model is firstly learnt on the scored\nunlabeled data, and then fine-tuned on scored labeled data, by leveraging both\nlabels and scores via minimizing the proposed label-aware weighted loss.\nAccording to our experiments, compared with the baseline that directly learns\nfrom relevance labels, training by the proposed framework outperforms it by a\nlarge margin, and improves data efficiency substantially by dispensing with 80%\nlabeled samples. The proposed framework allows us to improve the fast matching\nmodel by learning from stronger annotators while keeping its architecture\nunchanged. Meanwhile, our training framework offers a principled manner to\nleverage search log data in the training phase, which could effectively\nalleviate our dependency on human provided labels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 08:42:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 02:15:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 00:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-23"}

We have found the band-edge cathodoluminescence of these\ncrystals to peak in the range from 2.00 to 2.03 eV at 300 K and from 2.02 to\n2.06 eV at 80 K. We have also estimated the value of the band gap derivative\nd$E_g$/d$T$ in the interval from 80 to 300 K and found it to lie in the range\nfrom $-2.5 \\times 10^{-4}$ to 0 eV/K. CdZnSSe crystals in glass demonstrate\nhigh temperature and temporal stability. The glass-crystal composite on their\nbasis is resistant to the electron-beam irradiation and long-term weathering.\nPossible applications of this composite in modern technologies, and processes\nand components that might be used for making glass stained with CdZnSSe in the\npast are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 11:12:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 20:24:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 16:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-06"}

In this paper, the behavior in the interior is specified by a\ngenerator of a Markov process, and the constraints are specified by a\ncontrolled generator. Together, the generators define a \"constrained martingale\nproblem\". The desired constrained processes are constructed by first solving a\nsimpler \"controlled martingale problem\" and then obtaining the desired process\nas a time-change of the controlled process. As for ordinary martingale\nproblems, it is rarely obvious that the process constructed in this manner is\nunique. The primary goal of the paper is to show that from among the processes\nconstructed in this way one can \"select\", in the sense of Krylov, a strong\nMarkov process. Corollaries to these constructions include the observation that\nuniqueness among strong Markov solutions implies uniqueness among all\nsolutions. These results provide useful tools for proving uniqueness for\nconstrained processes including reflecting diffusions.

We present the Invisible Light\nSwitch (ILS) to address both aspects. ILS dynamically adjusts the room\nillumination level to save energy while maintaining constant the light level\nperception of the users. So the energy saving is invisible to them. Our\nproposed ILS leverages a radiosity model to estimate the light level which is\nperceived by a person within an indoor environment, taking into account the\nperson position and her/his viewing frustum (head pose). ILS may therefore dim\nthose luminaires, which are not seen by the user, resulting in an effective\nenergy saving, especially in large open offices (where light may otherwise be\nON everywhere for a single person). To quantify the system performance, we have\ncollected a new dataset where people wear luxmeter devices while working in\noffice rooms. The luxmeters measure the amount of light (in Lux) reaching the\npeople gaze, which we consider a proxy to their illumination level perception.\nOur initial results are promising: in a room with 8 LED luminaires, the energy\nconsumption in a day may be reduced from 18585 to 6206 watts with ILS\n(currently needing 1560 watts for operations).

A very good timing resolution in\ndetecting single photons is also demonstrated in laser beams. The PICOSEC\ntiming resolution is determined mainly by the drift field. The arrival time of\nthe signal and the timing resolution vary with the size of the pulse amplitude.\nDetailed simulations based on GARFIELD++ reproduce the experimental PICOSEC\ntiming characteristics. This agreement is exploited to identify the microscopic\nphysical variables, which determine the observed timing properties. In these\nstudies, several counter-intuitive observations are made for the behavior of\nsuch microscopic variables. In order to gain insight on the main physical\nmechanisms causing the observed behavior, a phenomenological model is\nconstructed and presented. The model is based on a simple mechanism of\n\"time-gain per interaction\" and it employs a statistical description of the\navalanche evolution. It describes quantitatively the dynamical and statistical\nproperties of the microscopic quantities, which determine the PICOSEC timing\ncharacteristics, in excellent agreement with the simulations. In parallel, it\noffers phenomenological explanations for the behavior of these microscopic\nvariables. The formulae expressing this model can be used as a tool for fast\nand reliable predictions, provided that the input parameter values (e.g. drift\nvelocities) are known for the considered operating conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 12:11:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 20:22:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 13:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

The\nwaves are resonantly damped in the Alfv\\'en continuum because of plasma and/or\nmagnetic field nonuniformity across the loop. The resonant damping is relevant\nin the context of coronal heating, since it provides a mechanism to cascade\nenergy down to the dissipative scales. It has been theoretically shown that the\npresence of flow affects the waves propagation and damping, but most of the\nstudies rely on the unjustified assumption that the transverse nonuniformity is\nconfined to a boundary layer much thinner than the radius of the loop. Here we\npresent a semi-analytic technique to explore the effect of flow on resonant MHD\nwaves in coronal flux tubes with thick nonuniform boundaries. We extend a\npublished method, which was originally developed for a static plasma, in order\nto incorporate the effect of flow. We allowed the flow velocity to continuously\nvary within the nonuniform boundary from the internal velocity to the external\nvelocity. The analytic part of the method is based on expressing the wave\nperturbations in the thick nonuniform boundary of the loop as a Frobenius\nseries that contains a singular term accounting for the Alfv\\'en resonance,\nwhile the numerical part of the method consists of solving iteratively the\ntranscendental dispersion relation together with the equation for the Alfv\\'en\nresonance position. As an application of this method, we investigated the\nimpact of flow on the phase velocity and resonant damping length of MHD kink\nwaves. We consistently recover results in the thin boundary approximation\nobtained in previous studies. We have extended those results to the case of\nthick boundaries. We also explored the error associated with the use of the\nthin boundary approximation beyond its regime of applicability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 12:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

In this paper we show that a wiser method of duplication\nentails great potential benefits for data types tolerating approximate\nrepresentations, like images and videos. We propose a method to produce a set\nof distinct compressed representations for a given signal, such that any subset\nof them allows reconstruction of the signal at a quality depending only on the\nnumber of compressed representations utilized. Essentially, we implement the\nholographic representation idea, where all the representations are equally\nimportant in refining the reconstruction. Here we propose to exploit the shift\nsensitivity of common compression processes and generate holographic\nrepresentations via compression of various shifts of the signal. Two\nimplementations for the idea, based on standard compression methods, are\npresented: the first is a simple, optimization-free design. The second approach\noriginates in a challenging rate-distortion optimization, mitigated by the\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), leading to a process of\nrepeatedly applying standard compression techniques. Evaluation of the\napproach, in conjunction with the JPEG2000 image compression standard, shows\nthe effectiveness of the optimization in providing compressed holographic\nrepresentations that, by means of an elementary reconstruction process, enable\nimpressive gains of several dBs in PSNR over exact duplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 13:23:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 18:09:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-08"}

Even though modern\nnumerical methods allow to accurately calculate the optical response of complex\nstructures, the inverse design of metamaterials is still a challenging task due\nto the non-intuitive and non-unique relationship between physical structures\nand optical responses. To better unveil this implicit relationship and thus\nfacilitate metamaterial design, we propose to represent metamaterials and model\nthe inverse design problem in a probabilistically generative manner. By\nemploying an encoder-decoder configuration, our deep generative model\ncompresses the meta-atom design and optical response into a latent space, where\nsimilar designs and similar optical responses are automatically clustered\ntogether. Therefore, by sampling in the latent space, the stochastic latent\nvariables function as codes, from which the candidate designs are generated\nupon given requirements in a decoding process. With the effective latent\nrepresentation of metamaterials, we can elegantly model the complex\nstructure-performance relationship in an interpretable way, and solve the\none-to-many mapping issue that is intractable in a deterministic model.\nMoreover, to alleviate the burden of numerical calculation in data collection,\nwe develop a semi-supervised learning strategy that allows our model to utilize\nunlabeled data in addition to labeled data during training, simultaneously\noptimizing the generative inverse design and deterministic forward prediction\nin an end-to-end manner.

These features are orbital\nfree, and provide a systematic route to including information at various length\nscales. This work shows that convolutional descriptors are theoretically\ncapable of an exact representation of the electron density, and proposes\nMaxwell-Cartesian spherical harmonic kernels as a class of rotationally\ninvariant descriptors for the construction of machine-learned functionals. The\napproach is demonstrated using data from the B3LYP functional on a number of\nsmall-molecules containing C, H, O, and N along with a neural network\nregression model. The machine-learned functionals are compared to standard\nphysical approximations and the accuracy is assessed for the absolute energy of\neach molecular system as well as formation energies. The results indicate that\nit is possible to reproduce B3LYP formation energies to within chemical\naccuracy using orbital-free descriptors with a spatial extent of 0.2 A. The\nfindings provide empirical insight into the spatial range of electron exchange,\nand suggest that the combination of convolutional descriptors and\nmachine-learning regression models is a promising new framework for XC\nfunctional design, although challenges remain in obtaining training data and\ngenerating models consistent with pseudopotentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 13:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

We present a novel approach for regularizing adversarial models\nby enforcing diverse feature learning. In order to do this, both generator and\ndiscriminator are regularized by penalizing both negatively and positively\ncorrelated features according to their differentiation and based on their\nrelative cosine distances. In addition to the gradient information from the\nadversarial loss made available by the discriminator, diversity regularization\nalso ensures that a more stable gradient is provided to update both the\ngenerator and discriminator. Results indicate our regularizer enforces diverse\nfeatures, stabilizes training, and improves image synthesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 13:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-31"}

Most of the election\nrules studied in the literature require the voters to rank the candidates from\nthe most to the least preferred one. This method of eliciting preferences is\nimpractical when the number of candidates to be ranked is large. We ask how\nwell certain election rules (focusing on positional scoring rules and the\nMinimax rule) can be approximated from partial preferences collected through\none of the following procedures: (i) randomized-we ask each voter to rank a\nrandom subset of $\\ell$ candidates, and (ii) deterministic-we ask each voter to\nprovide a ranking of her $\\ell$ most preferred candidates (the $\\ell$-truncated\nballot). We establish theoretical bounds on the approximation ratios and we\ncomplement our theoretical analysis with computer simulations. We find that\nmostly (apart from the cases when the preferences have no or very little\nstructure) it is better to use the randomized approach.

To assign low-precise weights\nduring learning is a non-trivial task, but may benefit from representing\nto-be-learned items using sparse code. However, the computational difficulty\nresulting from low weight precision and the advantage of sparse coding remain\nnot fully understood. Here, we study a perceptron model, which associates\nbinary (0 or 1) input patterns with outputs using binary (0 or 1) weights,\nmodeling a single neuron receiving excitatory inputs. We considered a\ndecimation process, where every time step, marginal probabilities of unfixed\nweights were evaluated, then the most polarized weight was fixed at its\npreferred value. We showed that decimation is a process approaching the dense\nsolution region in weight configuration space. In two efficient algorithms\n(SBPI and rBP) for solving binary-weight perceptron, most time steps are spent\non determining values of the weights fixed late in decimation. This algorithmic\ndifficult point may result from strong cross-correlation between\nlate-decimation-fixed weights in the solution subspace where\nearly-decimation-fixed weights take their fixed values, and is related to\nsolution condensation in this subspace during decimation. Input sparseness\nreduces the time steps that SBPI and rBP need to find solutions, by reducing\ntime steps used to assign values to late-decimation-fixed weights, due to the\nreduction of cross-correlation between late-decimation-fixed weights. Our work\nsuggests that the computational difficulty of constraint satisfaction problem\noriginates from the subspace of late-decimation-fixed variables.

We used the Clumpfind algorithm to extract\nthe clumps from the 870$\\mu$m and $^{12}$CO(4$-$3) data.

In the case of ferromagnetic materials, the\natomistic approach handles the dynamics of spin magnetic moments of individual\natoms, while the continuum approximations operate with volume-averaged\nquantities, such as magnetisation. One of the challenges for multiscale models\nin relation to physics of ferromagnets is the existence of the long-range\ndipole-dipole interactions between spins. The aim of the present paper is to\ndemonstrate a way of including these interactions into existing\natomistic-continuum coupling methods based on the partitioned-domain and the\nupscaling strategies. This is achieved by modelling the demagnetising field\nexclusively at the continuum level and coupling it to both scales.

PEP can\nbe considered from two viewpoints. On the one hand, it asserts that particles\nwith half-integer spin (fermions) are described by antisymmetric wave\nfunctions, and particles with integer spin (bosons) are described by symmetric\nwave functions. This is the so-called spin-statistics connection (SSC). As we\nwill discuss, the physical reasons why SSC exists are still unknown. On the\nother hand, according to PEP, the permutation symmetry of the total wave\nfunctions can be only of two types: symmetric or antisymmetric, both belong to\none-dimensional representations of the permutation group, all other types of\npermutation symmetry are forbidden; whereas the solution of the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation may have any permutation symmetry. It is demonstrated that the proof\nin some widespread textbooks on quantum mechanics that only symmetric and\nantisymmetric states (one-dimensional representations of the permutation group)\ncan exist is wrong. However, the scenarios, in which an arbitrary permutation\nsymmetry (degenerate permutation states) is permitted lead to contradictions\nwith the concepts of particle identity and their independence. Thus, the\nexistence in our nature particles only in nondegenerate permutation states\n(symmetric and antisymmetric) is not accidental and so-called symmetrization\npostulate may not be considered as a postulate, since all other symmetry\noptions for the total wave function may not be realized. From this an important\nconclusion follows: we may not expect that in future some unknown elementary\nparticles can be discovered that are not fermions or bosons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 22:36:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 19:45:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 19:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-29"}

The cover image with the secret\nmessage is called a stego image. Steganography is commonly used for illegal\npurposes such as terrorist activities and pornography. To thwart covert\ncommunications and transactions, attacking algorithms against steganography,\ncalled steganalysis, exist. Currently, there are many studies implementing deep\nlearning to the steganography algorithm. However, conventional steganalysis is\nno longer effective for deep learning based steganography algorithms. Our\nframework is the first one to disturb covert communications and transactions\nvia the recent deep learning-based steganography algorithms. We first extract a\nsophisticated pixel distribution of the potential stego image from the\nauto-regressive model induced by deep learning. Using the extracted pixel\ndistributions, we detect whether an image is the stego or not at the pixel\nlevel. Each pixel value is adjusted as required and the adjustment induces an\neffective removal of the secret image. Because the decoding method of deep\nlearning-based steganography algorithms is approximate (lossy), which is\ndifferent from the conventional steganography, we propose a new quantitative\nmetric that is more suitable for measuring the accurate effect. We evaluate our\nmethod using three public benchmarks in comparison with a conventional\nsteganalysis method and show up to a 20% improvement in terms of decoding rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 10:16:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2019 00:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}
