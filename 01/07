To do this, we first\nsummarise the observational evidence for the value of the dimensionless\naccretion disc viscosity parameter $\\alpha$, defined by Shakura & Sunyaev\n(1973, 1976). We find that, for fully ionized discs, the value of $\\alpha$ is\nreadily amenable to reliable estimation and that the observations are\nconsistent with the hypothesis that $\\alpha \\sim 0.2 - 0.3$. In contrast in\ndiscs that are not fully ionized, estimates of the value of $\\alpha$ are\ngenerally less direct and the values obtained are generally $ < 0.01$ and often\n$ \\ll 0.01$. We conclude that this gives us crucial information about the\nnature of viscosity in accretion discs. First, in fully ionized discs the\nstrength of the turbulence is always limited by being at most trans-sonic.

Quickly identifying the\nlocation of the supernova on the sky and disseminating it to the all available\nground and spaced-based instruments will be critical to learn as much as\npossible about the event. Some neutrino experiments can report pointing\ninformation for these galactic CCSNe. In particular, the Super-Kamiokande\nexperiment can point to a few degrees for CCSNe near the center of our galaxy.\nA CCSN located 10 kpc from Earth is expected to result in a pointing resolution\non the order of 3 degrees. LSST's field of view (FOV) is well matched to this\ninitial search box. LSSTs depth is also uniquely suited for identifying CCSNe\neven if they fail or are obscured by the dust of the galactic plane. This is a\nproposal to, upon receipt of such an alert, prioritize the use of LSST for a\nfull day of observing to continuously monitor a pre-identified region of sky\nand, by using difference imaging, identify and announce the location of the\nsupernova.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2019 19:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

A reliable fully-automated\nsegmentation method from magnetic resonance images could greatly help\nclinicians to plan therapeutic interventions and predict interventional\noutcomes while eliminating time consuming manual segmentation efforts. The\npurpose of this work is three-fold. First, we investigate the feasibility of\npathological shoulder muscle segmentation using deep learning techniques, given\na very limited amount of available annotated pediatric data. Second, we address\nthe learning transferability from healthy to pathological data by comparing\ndifferent learning schemes in terms of model generalizability. Third, extended\nversions of deep convolutional encoder-decoder architectures using encoders\npre-trained on non-medical data are proposed to improve the segmentation\naccuracy.

An important and pressing problem that follows is how to deploy\nthem in existing datacenters. One viable approach is to attach PM as\nself-contained devices to the network as disaggregated persistent memory, or\nDPM. DPM requires no changes to existing servers in datacenters; without the\nneed to include a processor, DPM devices are cheap to build; and by sharing DPM\nacross compute servers, they offer great elasticity and efficient resource\npacking.\n  This paper explores different ways to organize DPM and to build data stores\nwith DPM. Specifically, we propose three architectures of DPM: 1) compute nodes\ndirectly access DPM (DPM-Direct); 2) compute nodes send requests to a\ncoordinator server, which then accesses DPM to complete a request\n(DPM-Central); and 3) compute nodes directly access DPM for data operations and\ncommunicate with a global metadata server for the control plane (DPM-Sep).\nBased on these architectures, we built three atomic, crash-consistent data\nstores. We evaluated their performance, scalability, and CPU cost with\nmicro-benchmarks and YCSB. Our evaluation results show that DPM-Direct has\ngreat small-size read but poor write performance; DPM-Central has the best\nwrite performance when the scale of the cluster is small but performs poorly\nwhen the scale increases; and DPM-Sep performs well overall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 00:02:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

First, developing careful sparse\ngraph constructions with small cuts extends known techniques to show a\nnear-linear lower bound for computing the diameter, a result previously known\nonly for dense graphs. Moreover, the sparseness of the construction plays a\ncrucial role in applying it to approximations of various distance computation\nproblems, drastically improving over what can be obtained when using dense\ngraphs.\n  Second, small cuts are essential for proving super-linear lower bounds, none\nof which were known prior to this work. In fact, they allow us to show\nnear-quadratic lower bounds for several problems, such as exact minimum vertex\ncover or maximum independent set, as well as for coloring a graph with its\nchromatic number. Such strong lower bounds are not limited to NP-hard problems,\nas given by two simple graph problems in P which are shown to require a\nquadratic and near-quadratic number of rounds. All of the above are optimal up\nto logarithmic factors. In addition, in this context, the complexity of the\nall-pairs-shortest-paths problem is discussed.\n  Finally, it is shown that graph constructions for CONGEST lower bounds\ntranslate to lower bounds for the semi-streaming model, despite being very\ndifferent in its nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 00:09:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 09:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

TOI-197 (HIP116158) is a bright\n(V=8.2 mag), spectroscopically classified subgiant which oscillates with an\naverage frequency of about 430 muHz and displays a clear signature of mixed\nmodes. The oscillation amplitude confirms that the redder TESS bandpass\ncompared to Kepler has a small effect on the oscillations, supporting the\nexpected yield of thousands of solar-like oscillators with TESS 2-minute\ncadence observations. Asteroseismic modeling yields a robust determination of\nthe host star radius (2.943+/-0.064 Rsun), mass (1.212 +/- 0.074 Msun) and age\n(4.9+/-1.1 Gyr), and demonstrates that it has just started ascending the\nred-giant branch. Combining asteroseismology with transit modeling and\nradial-velocity observations, we show that the planet is a \"hot Saturn\"\n(9.17+/-0.33 Rearth) with an orbital period of ~14.3 days, irradiance of\n343+/-24 Fearth, moderate mass (60.5 +/- 5.7 Mearth) and density (0.431+/-0.062\ngcc). The properties of TOI-197.01 show that the host-star metallicity - planet\nmass correlation found in sub-Saturns (4-8 Rearth) does not extend to larger\nradii, indicating that planets in the transition between sub-Saturns and\nJupiters follow a relatively narrow range of densities. With a density measured\nto ~15%, TOI-197.01 is one of the best characterized Saturn-sized planets to\ndate, augmenting the small number of known transiting planets around evolved\nstars and demonstrating the power of TESS to characterize exoplanets and their\nhost stars using asteroseismology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 01:58:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 02:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

In\nparticular, a density parameter is defined and related to NS mass and radius.\nSpinning BHs in Kerr metrics are considered as infinitely thin, homogeneous,\nrigidly rotating disks in Newtonian mechanics. Physical parameters for\nnonrotating (TOV) and equatorial breakup (EQB) configurations are taken or\ninferred from a recent investigation with regard to 4 NS and 3 quark star (QS)\nphysically motivated equation of state (EOS) kinds. A comparison is performed\nwith counterparts related to nonrotating and maximally rotating BHs. The\nresults are also considered in the light of empirical relations present in\nliterature. With regard to $J$-$M$ relation, EQB configurations are placed on a\nsequence of similar slope in comparison to maximally rotating BHs, but shifted\ndownwards due to lower angular momentum by a factor of about 3.6. Under the\nassumption heavy baryons are NS constituents and instantaneously undergo\nquark-level reactions, the energy released (or adsorbed) is calculated using\nresults from a recent investigation. Even if NSs exclusively host heavy baryons\nof the kind considered, the total amount cannot exceed about 10\\% of the\nbinding energy, which inhibits supernova explosions as in supramassive white\ndwarf (WD) remnants or implosions into BH.

We show that deep image restoration networks learn mapping\nfunctions that can bring off-the-manifold adversarial samples onto the natural\nimage manifold, thus restoring classification towards correct classes.

In this paper we investigate Ramsey questions in the\nsetting of randomly perturbed graphs: this is a random graph model introduced\nby Bohman, Frieze and Martin in which one starts with a dense graph and then\nadds a given number of random edges to it. The study of Ramsey properties of\nrandomly perturbed graphs was initiated by Krivelevich, Sudakov and Tetali in\n2006; they determined how many random edges must be added to a dense graph to\nensure the resulting graph is with high probability $(K_3,K_t)$-Ramsey (for\n$t\\ge 3$). They also raised the question of generalising this result to pairs\nof graphs other than $(K_3,K_t)$. We make significant progress on this\nquestion, giving a precise solution in the case when $H_1=K_s$ and $H_2=K_t$\nwhere $s,t \\ge 5$. Although we again show that one requires polynomially fewer\nedges than in the purely random graph, our result shows that the problem in\nthis case is quite different to the $(K_3,K_t)$-Ramsey question.

The proposed method reaches the EER less than 1% for samples\ncollected up to 10 hours after death, when compared to 16.89% and 5.37% of EER\nobserved for OSIRIS and IriCore, respectively. For samples collected up to 369\nhours post-mortem, the proposed method achieves the EER 21.45%, while 33.59%\nand 25.38% are observed for OSIRIS and IriCore, respectively. Additionally, the\nmethod is tested on a database of iris images collected from ophthalmology\nclinic patients, for which it also offers an advantage over the two other\nalgorithms. This work is the first step towards post-mortem-specific iris\nrecognition, which increases the chances of identification of deceased subjects\nin forensic investigations. The new database of post-mortem iris images\nacquired from 42 subjects, as well as the deep learning-based segmentation\nmodels are made available along with the paper, to ensure all the results\npresented in this manuscript are reproducible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 08:57:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 09:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

For the past decade, various FIM-SD methods in one-pass\napproximation settings have been developed to approximate the frequency of each\nitemset. These approaches can be categorized into two approximation types:\nparameter-constrained (PC) mining and resource-constrained (RC) mining. PC\nmethods control the maximum error that can be included in the frequency based\non a pre-defined parameter. In contrast, RC methods limit the maximum memory\nconsumption based on resource constraints. However, the existing PC methods can\nexponentially increase the memory consumption, while the existing RC methods\ncan rapidly increase the maximum error. In this study, we address this problem\nby introducing the notion of a condensed representation, called a\n$\\Delta$-covered set, to the RC approximation. This notion is regarded as an\nextension of the closedness compression and when $\\Delta = 0$, the solution\ncorresponds to an ordinary closed itemset. The algorithm searches for such\napproximate closed itemsets that can restore the frequent itemsets and their\nfrequencies under resource constraint while the maximum error is bounded by an\ninteger, $\\Delta$. We first propose a one-pass approximation algorithm to find\nthe condensed solution. Then, we improve the basic algorithm by introducing a\nunified PC-RC approximation approach. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that\nthe proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art PC and RC\nmethods for FIM-SD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 08:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

Many previous approaches formulate this issue as a low-rank matrix\napproximation problem. Recently, a truncated nuclear norm has been presented as\na surrogate of traditional nuclear norm, for better estimation to the rank of a\nmatrix. The truncated nuclear norm regularization (TNNR) method is applicable\nin real-world scenarios. However, it is sensitive to the selection of the\nnumber of truncated singular values and requires numerous iterations to\nconverge. Hereby, this paper proposes a revised approach called the double\nweighted truncated nuclear norm regularization (DW-TNNR), which assigns\ndifferent weights to the rows and columns of a matrix separately, to accelerate\nthe convergence with acceptable performance. The DW-TNNR is more robust to the\nnumber of truncated singular values than the TNNR. Instead of the iterative\nupdating scheme in the second step of TNNR, this paper devises an efficient\nstrategy that uses a gradient descent manner in a concise form, with a\ntheoretical guarantee in optimization. Sufficient experiments conducted on real\nvisual data prove that DW-TNNR has promising performance and holds the\nsuperiority in both speed and accuracy for matrix completion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 09:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

Aims: We aim to determine the modified black\nbody (MBB) model parameters of thermal dust emission in total intensity and\nproduce all sky maps of pure thermal dust, having separated this Galactic\ncomponent from the CMB and CIB. Methods: This separation is completed using a\nnew, sparsity-based, parametric method which we refer to as premise. The method\ncomprises of three main stages: 1) filtering of the raw data to reduce the\neffect of the CIB on the MBB fit. 2) fitting an MBB model to the filtered data\nacross super-pixels of various sizes determined by the algorithm itself and 3)\nrefining these super-pixel estimates into full resolution maps of the MBB\nparameters.

As an effective approach to solve graph mining problems, network\nembedding aims to learn a low-dimensional feature vector representation for\neach node of a given network. The vast majority of existing network embedding\nalgorithms, however, are only designed for unsigned networks, and the signed\nnetworks containing both positive and negative links, have pretty distinct\nproperties from the unsigned counterpart. In this paper, we propose a deep\nnetwork embedding model to learn the low-dimensional node vector\nrepresentations with structural balance preservation for the signed networks.\nThe model employs a semi-supervised stacked auto-encoder to reconstruct the\nadjacency connections of a given signed network. As the adjacency connections\nare overwhelmingly positive in the real-world signed networks, we impose a\nlarger penalty to make the auto-encoder focus more on reconstructing the scarce\nnegative links than the abundant positive links. In addition, to preserve the\nstructural balance property of signed networks, we design the pairwise\nconstraints to make the positively connected nodes much closer than the\nnegatively connected nodes in the embedding space. Based on the network\nrepresentations learned by the proposed model, we conduct link sign prediction\nand community detection in signed networks.

The MAGIC telescopes detected a fast\nvery high energy (VHE, E$>100$ GeV) $\\gamma$-ray flare from BL Lacertae on 2015\nJune 15. The flare had a maximum flux of $(1.5\\pm 0.3)\\times 10^{-10}$ photons\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and halving time of $26\\pm8$ minutes.

Well-sampled multiwavelength data allow us to\nstudy the variability in detail and compare it to the other epochs when fast\nVHE $\\gamma$-ray flares have been detected from this source. Interestingly, we\nfind that the behaviour in radio, optical, X-rays and HE $\\gamma$-rays is very\nsimilar to two other observed VHE $\\gamma$-ray flares. In particular, also\nduring this flare there was an indication of rotation of the optical\npolarization angle and of activity at the 43\\,GHz core. These repeating\npatterns indicate a connection between the three events. We also test modelling\nof the spectral energy distribution, based on constraints from the light curves\nand VLBA observations, with two different geometrical setups of two-zone\ninverse Compton models. In addition we model the $\\gamma$-ray data with the\nstar-jet interaction model. We find that all of the tested emission models are\ncompatible with the fast VHE $\\gamma$-ray flare, but all have some tension with\nthe multiwavelength observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 10:06:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

The\npresence of dust strongly affects the light produced by stars within a galaxy.\nAs these photons are our main information vector to explore the stellar mass\nassembly and therefore understand a galaxy's evolution, modeling the luminous\nproperties of galaxies and taking into account the impact of the dust is a\nfundamental challenge for semi-analytical models.We present the complete\nprescription of dust attenuation implemented in the new semi-analytical model:\nG.A.S. This model is based on a two-phase medium originating from a physically\nmotivated turbulent model of gas structuring (G.A.S. I paper). Dust impact is\ntreated by taking into account three dust components: Polycyclic Aromatic\nHydrocarbons, Very Small Grains, and Big Grains. All three components evolve in\nboth a diffuse and a fragmented/dense gas phase. Each phase has its own stars,\ndust content and geometry. Dust content evolves according to the metallicity of\nit associated phase.The G.A.S. model is used to predict both the UV and the IR\nluminosity functions from $z=9.0$ to $z=0.1$. Our two-phase ISM prescription\ncatches very well the evolution of UV and IR luminosity functions. We note a\nsmall overproduction of the IR luminosity at low redshift ($z<0.5$).

In recent years, an in-depth gamma-ray analysis of the Orion region\nhas been carried out by the AGILE and Fermi-LAT (Large Area Telescope) teams\nwith the aim of estimating the H2-CO conversion factor, XCO. The comparison of\nthe data from both satellites with models of diffuse gamma-ray Galactic\nemission unveiled an excess at (l,b)=[213.9, -19.5], in a region at a short\nangular distance from the OB star k-Ori. Possible explanations of this excess\nare scattering of the so-called \"dark gas\", non-linearity in the H2-CO\nrelation, or Cosmic-Ray (CR) energization at the k-Ori wind shock.\n  Aims. Concerning this last hypothesis, we want to verify whether cosmic-ray\nacceleration or re-acceleration could be triggered at the k-Ori forward shock,\nwhich we suppose to be interacting with a star-forming shell detected in\nseveral wavebands and probably triggered by high energy particles.\n  Methods.

Regarding data profiling, we define and\ncapture a fine-grained location profile powered by a diverse range of location\ndata sources, such as transportation profile (e.g., distance to nearest train\nstation), education profile (e.g., school zones and ranking), suburb profile\nbased on census data, facility profile (e.g., nearby hospitals, supermarkets).\nRegarding the choice of prediction model, we observe that a variety of\napproaches either consider the entire house data for modeling, or split the\nentire data and model each partition independently. However, such modeling\nignores the relatedness between partitions, and for all prediction scenarios,\nthere may not be sufficient training samples per partition for the latter\napproach. We address this problem by conducting a careful study of exploiting\nthe Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model. Specifically, we map the strategies for\nsplitting the entire house data to the ways the tasks are defined in MTL, and\neach partition obtained is aligned with a task. Furthermore, we select specific\nMTL-based methods with different regularization terms to capture and exploit\nthe relatedness between tasks. Based on real-world house transaction data\ncollected in Melbourne, Australia. We design extensive experimental\nevaluations, and the results indicate a significant superiority of MTL-based\nmethods over state-of-the-art approaches. Meanwhile, we conduct an in-depth\nanalysis on the impact of task definitions and method selections in MTL on the\nprediction performance, and demonstrate that the impact of task definitions on\nprediction performance far exceeds that of method selections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 12:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

Here, we\nrevisit the correlation relating the instantaneous flux, $F$, and the photon\nindex below the spectral break, $\\alpha$, in individual emission pulses, by\nstudying the 38 most prominent pulses in the Fermi/GBM GRB catalogue. First, we\nsearch for signatures of the bias in the determination of $\\alpha$ due to the\nlimited spectral coverage (window effect) expected in the synchrotron case. The\nabsence of such a characteristic signature argues against the simplest\nsynchrotron models. We instead find that the observed correlation between $F$\nand $\\alpha$ can, in general, be described by the relation $F(t) \\propto {\\rm\ne}^{k\\,\\alpha(t)}$, for which the median $k = 3$. We suggest that this\ncorrelation is a manifestation of subphotospheric heating in a flow with a\nvarying entropy. Around the peak of the light curve, a large entropy causes the\nphotosphere to approach the saturation radius, leading to an intense emission\nwith a narrow spectrum. As the entropy decreases the photosphere secedes from\nthe saturation radius, and weaker emission with a broader spectrum is expected.\nThis simple scenario naturally leads to a correlated variation of the intensity\nand spectral shape, covering the observed range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 12:38:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 16:16:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

The sources were selected within the\nG351.77-0.51 complex to minimise the variation of initial chemical conditions,\nand to remove distance effects. We modelled their dust continuum emission to\nestimate their physical properties, and also modelled their spectra under the\nassumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium to calculate beam-averaged\nabundances.\n  Results: We find an anticorrelation between the abundance of o-H$_2$D$^+$ and\nthat of N$_2$D$^+$, with the former decreasing and the latter increasing with\nevolution.

This paper was therefore designed to introduce a\nnovel compatible parameter set (CPS) determined from IOP-matched scenario,\nhopefully could show its compatibility and superiority for recognizing\nkeratoconus in both IOP-matched and not scenarios. METHODS: A total of 335 eyes\nwere included.

We infer a SMBH spin of\n0.83$^{+0.05}_{-0.03}$, adopting the SMBH reverberation mass of\n1.50$\\times$10$^{8}$ M$_{\\odot}$. In addition, we find that the coronal radius\ndecreases with increasing flux (by about a factor of two), from\n85$^{+13}_{-10}$ $R_{\\rm g}$ in 2013 to 14$\\pm$3 $R_{\\rm g}$ in 2014. This is\nthe first time that such a constraint is obtained for a SMBH spin from this\ntechnique, thanks to the bare properties of Ark 120, its well determined SMBH\nmass, and the presence of a mild relativistic reflection component in 2014\nwhich allows us to constrain the disc inclination angle. We caution that these\nresults depend on the detailed disc-corona structure, which is not yet fully\nestablished. However, the realistic parameter values found suggest that this is\na promising method to determine spin in moderate accretion rate AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 14:04:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

In order to\ninterpret and accurately model such observations, the vector radiative transfer\nequation needs to be solved, because scattering polarizes the initially\nunpolarized incoming solar radiation. A widely used approximation in radiative\ntransfer theory is the neglect of polarization which allows to greatly simplify\nthe radiative transfer equation. It is well known that the error caused by\nmultiple Rayleigh scattering can be larger than 10\\%, depending on wavelength\nand sun-observer geometry (Mishchenko et al., 1994). For homogeneous\nplane-parallel layers of liquid cloud droplets the error is comparatively small\n(below 1\\%) (Hansen 1971). However, in reality clouds are not plane-parallel\nlayers of water droplets but complex three-dimensional (3D) structures and\nobservations of clouds usually include pixels consisting of clear and cloudy\nparts. In this study we revisit the question of the magnitude of error due to\nthe neglect of polarization in radiative transfer theory for a realistic 3D\ncloudy atmosphere.

At a phase\nangle of 90{\\deg} and 400nm wavelength we find the maximum overestimation error\nof about 8% for complete clear-sky conditions.

Such\nhigh resolution spectra are measured by various satellite instruments for\nremote sensing of atmospheric trace gases. ALIS (Absorption Lines Importance\nSampling) allows the calculation of spectra by tracing photons at only one\nwavelength: In order to take into account the spectral dependence of the\nabsorption coefficient a spectral absorption weight is calculated for each\nphoton path. At each scattering event the local estimate method is combined\nwith an importance sampling method to take into account the spectral dependence\nof the scattering coefficient. Since each wavelength grid point is computed\nbased on the same set of random photon paths, the statistical error is the\nalmost same for all wavelengths and hence the simulated spectrum is not noisy.\nThe statistical error mainly results in a small relative deviation which is\nindependent of wavelength and can be neglected for those remote sensing\napplications where differential absorption features are of interest.\n  Two example applications are presented: The simulation of shortwave-infrared\npolarized spectra as measured by GOSAT from which CO$_2$ is retrieved, and the\nsimulation of the differential optical thickness in the visible spectral range\nwhich is derived from SCIAMACHY measurements to retrieve NO$_2$.

Some of the distortions are specific to\nthe nature of 360-degree images, and often different from those encountered in\nthe classical image communication framework. This paper provides a first\ncomprehensive review of the most common visual distortions that alter\n360-degree signals undergoing state of the art processing in common\napplications.

It is essential for real-time\napplications to transmit status update packets to the destination node as\ntimely as possible. However, for some applications, status information embedded\nin the packets is not revealed until complicated data processing, which is\ncomputational expensive and time consuming. As mobile edge server has\nsufficient computational resource and is placed close to users, mobile edge\ncomputing (MEC) is expected to reduce age for computation-intensive messages.\nIn this paper, we study the AoI for computation-intensive data in MEC, and\nconsider two schemes: local computing by user itself and remote computing at\nMEC server. The two computing models are unified into a two-node tandem queuing\nmodel. Zero-wait policy is adopted, i.e., a new message is generated once the\nprevious one leaves the first node. We consider exponentially distributed\nservice time and infinite queue size, and hence, the second node can be seen as\na First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) M/M/1 system. Closed-form average AoI is\nderived for the two computing schemes. The region where remote computing\noutperforms local computing is characterized. Simulation results show that the\nremote computing is greatly superior to the local computing when the remote\ncomputing rate is large enough, and that there exists an optimal transmission\nrate so that remote computing is better than local computing for a largest\nrange.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 14:57:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 03:15:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 12 Jan 2019 05:45:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

Self-constructive Artificial\nIntelligence ($SCAI$) is one such possible framework. We herein propose that\n$SCAI$ is based on three principles of organization: self-growing,\nself-experimental and self-repairing. Self-growing: the ability to autonomously\nand incrementally construct structures and functionality as needed to solve\nencountered (sub)problems. Self-experimental: the ability to internally\nsimulate, anticipate and take decisions based on these expectations.\nSelf-repairing: the ability to autonomously re-construct a previously\nsuccessful functionality or pattern of interaction lost from a possible\nsub-component failure (damage). To implement these principles of organization,\na constructive architecture capable of evolving adaptive autonomous agents is\nrequired. We present Schema-based learning as one such architecture capable of\nincrementally constructing a myriad of internal models of three kinds:\npredictive schemas, dual (inverse models) schemas and goal schemas as they are\nnecessary to autonomously develop increasing functionality.\n  We claim that artificial systems, whether in the digital or in the physical\nworld, can benefit very much form this constructive architecture and should be\norganized around these principles of organization. To illustrate the generality\nof the proposed framework, we include several test cases in structural adaptive\nnavigation in artificial intelligence systems in Paper II of this series, and\nresilient robot motor control in Paper III of this series.

The key issue in CS is finding\nthe optimal solution for sparse optimization. In the past years, many\nalgorithms have been proposed in the field of applied mathematics. In this\npaper, we propose a machine-learning-based approach to solve the CS\ndata-reconstruction problem. By treating a computation process as a data flow,\nthe process of CS-based data reconstruction is formalized into a standard\nsupervised-learning task. The prior knowledge, i.e., the basis matrix and the\nCS-sampled signals, are used as the input and the target of the network; the\nbasis coefficient matrix is embedded as the parameters of a certain layer; the\nobjective function of conventional compressive sensing is set as the loss\nfunction of the network. Regularized by l1-norm, these basis coefficients are\noptimized to reduce the error between the original CS-sampled signals and the\nmasked reconstructed signals with a common optimization algorithm. Also, the\nproposed network can handle complex bases, such as a Fourier basis. Benefiting\nfrom the nature of a multi-neuron layer, multiple signal channels can be\nreconstructed simultaneously. Meanwhile, the disassembled use of a large-scale\nbasis makes the method memory-efficient. A numerical example of multiple\nsinusoidal waves and an example of field-test wireless data from a suspension\nbridge are carried out to illustrate the data-reconstruction ability of the\nproposed approach. The results show that high reconstruction accuracy can be\nobtained by the machine learning-based approach. Also, the parameters of the\nnetwork have clear meanings; the inference of the mapping between input and\noutput is fully transparent, making the CS data reconstruction neural network\ninterpretable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 01:26:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 07:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-25"}

We successfully recover known stellar structure of the Carina\nNebula, including the 5 young star clusters in this region. Four sub-clusters\ncontain no, or very few, stars with a degree of association above random which\nsuggests they may be fluctuations in the field rather than real clusters.

Further study is required to\nascertain the physical origin of the difference; (2) The different clustering\nproperties between these two regions are even more pronounced for OB stars; (3)\nThere are no signatures of classical mass segregation present in the SE region\n- massive stars here are not spatially concentrated together above random; (4)\nStellar concentrations are more frequent around massive stars than typical for\nthe general population, particularly in the Tr14 cluster; (5) There is a\nrelation between the concentration of OB stars and the concentration of (lower\nmass) stars around OB stars in the centrally concentrated Tr14 and Tr15, but no\nsuch relation exists in Tr16.

First, we determine the growth rate within the confined\nregion in the absence of a cavity. Growth within the contact induces a drift of\nthe crystal away from the substrate. Our results suggest novel strategies to\nmeasure surface kinetic coefficients based on the observation of this drift.\nFor the specific case where growth is controlled by surface kinetics outside\nthe contact, we show that the total displacement of the crystal due to the\ngrowth in the contact is finite. As a consequence, the growth shape approaches\nasymptotically the free growth shape truncated by a plane passing through the\ncenter of the crystal. Second, we investigate the conditions under which a\ncavity forms. The critical supersaturation above which the cavity forms is\nfound to be larger for slower surface kinetics. In addition, the critical\nsupersaturation decays as a power law of the contact size. The asymptotic value\nof the critical supersaturation and the exponent of the decay are found to be\ndifferent for attractive and repulsive disjoining pressures.

Traditionally,\ncontinuous deterministic methods based on differential equations have been used\nto deal with this problem. However discrete versions of some models are also\navailable and sometimes more adequate. In this paper, we randomize the Pielou\nlogistic equation in order to include the inherent uncertainty in modelling.\nTaking advantage of the method of transformation of random variables, we\nprovide a full probabilistic description to the randomized Pielou logistic\nmodel via the computation of the probability density functions of the solution\nstochastic process, the steady state and the time until a certain level of\npopulation is reached. The theoretical results are illustrated by means of two\nexamples, the first one consists of a numerical experiment and the second one\nshows an application to study the diffusion of a technology using real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 15:17:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

We assume that the\ninitial condition is a random variable and the diffusion coefficient is a\nstochastic process. The main objective is to obtain the first probability\ndensity function, $f_1(p,t)$, of the solution stochastic process,\n$P(t,\\omega)$. To achieve this goal, first the diffusion coefficient is\nrepresented via a truncation of order $N$ of the Karhunen-Lo\\`{e}ve expansion,\nand second, the Random Variable Transformation technique is applied. In this\nmanner, approximations, say $f_1^N(p,t)$, of $f_1(p,t)$ are constructed.\nAfterwards, we rigorously prove that $f_1^N(p,t) \\longrightarrow f_1(p,t)$ as\n$N\\to \\infty$ under mild conditions assumed on input data (initial condition\nand diffusion coefficient). Finally, three illustrative examples are shown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 14:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-31"}
