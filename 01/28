Thus, while SQL queries' inputs and\noutputs are sets of tuples, CRAQL queries' inputs and outputs are sets of\nabstract syntax trees (ASTs). This abstraction makes CRAQL queries composable\n(the output of one query can become the input to another) and improves the\npower of the language by allowing for querying of the tree structure and\nmetadata, as well as raw text. Furthermore, the abstraction enables\ntree-specific language optimizations and allows CRAQL to be easily applied to\nany language that is parsable into ASTs. These attributes, along with a\nfamiliar syntax similar to SQL, allow complex queries to be expressed in a\ncompact, straightforward manner.

Network operators\n(users) derive benefit from offloading their traffic to third party WiFi or\nfemtocell networks (link-suppliers). Link-suppliers experience costs for the\nadditional capacity that they provide. Users and link-suppliers (collectively\nreferred to as agents) have their pay-offs and cost functions as private\nknowledge. A network-manager decomposes the problem into a network problem and\nagent problems. The surrogate pay-offs and cost functions are modulated by the\nagents' bids. Agents' payoffs and costs are then determined by the allocations\nand prices set by the network-manager. Under this design, so long as the agents\ndo not anticipate the effect of their actions on the prices set by the\nnetwork-manager (i.e., price-taking agents), a competitive equilibrium exists\nas a solution to the network and agent problems, and this equilibrium optimizes\nthe sum utility of all agents. However, this design fails when the agents are\nall strategic (price-anticipating). Specifically, the presence of a strategic\nlink-supplier drives the system to an undesirable equilibrium with zero\nparticipation resulting in an efficiency loss of 100%. This is in stark\ncontrast to an earlier setting where the users alone are strategic but the\nlink-supplier is not - the efficiency loss is known to be at most 34%. The\npaper then proposes a Stackelberg game modification where the efficiency loss\ncan be characterized in terms of the link-supplier's cost function when the\nusers' pay-off functions are linear.

Once the\nions fill the channel, the pinching force from the quasi-static magnetic field\ngenerated by the accelerated electrons becomes uncompensated due to the\nreduction of the quasi-static transverse electric field. As a result there are\ntwo distinct populations of accelerated electrons: those that accelerate ahead\nof the expanding ion front while moving predominantly forward and those that\naccelerate in the presence of the ions in the channel while performing strong\ntransverse oscillations.

The average is broadcast back to the workers, which use it\nto perform a gradient-type step to update the local version of the model. It is\nalso well known that many such methods, including SGD, SAGA, and accelerated\nSGD for over-parameterized models, do not scale well with the number of\nparallel workers. In this paper we observe that the above template is\nfundamentally inefficient in that too much data is unnecessarily communicated\nby the workers, which slows down the overall system.

To give a sufficient condition for domain\nadaptation, we propose a natural and interpretable generalization upper bound\nthat explicitly takes into account the aforementioned shift. Moreover, we shed\nnew light on the problem by proving an information-theoretic lower bound on the\njoint error of \\emph{any} domain adaptation method that attempts to learn\ninvariant representations. Our result characterizes a fundamental tradeoff\nbetween learning invariant representations and achieving small joint error on\nboth domains when the marginal label distributions differ from source to\ntarget. Finally, we conduct experiments on real-world datasets that corroborate\nour theoretical findings. We believe these insights are helpful in guiding the\nfuture design of domain adaptation and representation learning algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jan 2019 22:44:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 May 2019 16:17:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}

While Hallak et al.'s solution is\nappealing, it cannot easily be transferred to nonlinear function approximation.\nFirst, it requires a projection step onto the probability simplex; second, even\nthough the operator describing the expected behavior of the off-policy learning\nalgorithm is convergent, it is not known to be a contraction mapping, and\nhence, may be more unstable in practice. We address these two issues by\nintroducing a discount factor into COP-TD. We analyze the behavior of\ndiscounted COP-TD and find it better behaved from a theoretical perspective. We\nalso propose an alternative soft normalization penalty that can be minimized\nonline and obviates the need for an explicit projection step. We complement our\nanalysis with an empirical evaluation of the two techniques in an off-policy\nsetting on the game Pong from the Atari domain where we find discounted COP-TD\nto be better behaved in practice than the soft normalization penalty. Finally,\nwe perform a more extensive evaluation of discounted COP-TD in 5 games of the\nAtari domain, where we find performance gains for our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Jan 2019 22:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

When the source is above the\nEddington limit, the hot spot temperature increases and the spectrum features\ntwo more blackbody components. One blackbody component has a radius of 10-20 km\nand is likely originated from the top of the accretion column. The other one\nsaturates at a blackbody luminosity of (1 - 2)*10^38 erg/s, coincident with the\nEddington limit of a neutron star.

Our solution is based on the insight that an attacker inevitably\naffects the link layer behavior of the wireless channel, and this behavior\nchange introduced by the attacker can be detected by the legitimate users.\nSpecifically, we propose a key exchange protocol and its corresponding channel\naccess mechanism for the protocol message transmission, in which the\nDiffie-Hellman parameter is transmitted multiple times in a row without being\ninterrupted by other data transmission on the same wireless channel. The\nproposed key exchange protocol forces the MITM attacker to cause multiple\npacket collisions consecutively at the receiver side, which can then be\nmonitored by the proposed detection algorithm. The performance of the proposed\nsolution is validated through both theoretical analysis and simulation: the\nproposed solution is secure against the MITM attack and can achieve an\narbitrarily low false positive ratio.

The results of ordinary band structure calculations are used in\norder to construct the minimal tight-binding type models describing the\nbehavior of the magnetic Cr $3d$ and ligand $p$ bands in the basis of localized\nWannier functions, and evaluate the effective exchange coupling ($J_{\\rm eff}$)\nbetween two Cr sublattices employing four different technique: (i) Second-order\nGreen's function perturbation theory for infinitesimal spin rotations of the\nLSDA (GGA) potential at the Cr sites; (ii) Enforcement of the magnetic force\ntheorem in order to treat both Cr and ligand spins on a localized footing;\n(iii) Constrained total-energy calculations with an external field, treated in\nthe framework of self-consistent linear response theory. We argue that the\nligand states play crucial role in the ferromagnetism of Cr trihalides, though\ntheir contribution to $J_{\\rm eff}$ strongly depends on additional assumptions,\nwhich are traced back to fundamentals of adiabatic spin dynamics. Particularly,\nby neglecting ligand spins in the Green's function method, $J_{\\rm eff}$ can\neasily become antiferromagnetic, while by treating them as localized, one can\nseverely overestimate the FM coupling. The best considered approach is based on\nthe constraint method, where the ligand states are allowed to relax in response\nto each instantaneous reorientation of the Cr spins, controlled by the external\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 05:48:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

There, however, also exist a multitude of SL tasks whose\ndata are acquired by sensors, e.g., pattern classification based on data\nproduced by imaging sensors. Solving such SL tasks naturally requires an\nintegrated approach harnessing tools from both quantum sensing and quantum\ncomputing.

In both schemes, variational circuits are employed to seek the\noptimum entangled probe states and measurement settings to maximize the\nentanglement-enabled {enhancement}. We observe that SLAEN enjoys an appreciable\nentanglement-enabled performance gain, even in the presence of loss, over\nconventional strategies in which classical data are acquired by separable\nsensors and subsequently processed by classical SL algorithms.

The reddening inferred for members and non-members allows us to\ndistinguish MS stars and giants, in agreement with the distances inferred from\nGaia DR2 data.

We derive stellar ages\nfor 382 confirmed cluster members and we find that the gravity-sensitive gamma\nindex distribution for M stars is correlated with stellar age. For all members\nwith Teff<5500 K, the mean logarithmic age is 5.84 (units of years) with a\ndispersion of 0.36 dex. The age distribution of stars with accretion and/or\ndisk (CTTSe) is similar to that of stars without accretion and without disk\n(WTTSp). We interpret this dispersion as evidence of a real age spread since\nthe total uncertainties on age determinations, derived from Monte Carlo\nsimulations, are significantly smaller than the observed spread. This\nconclusion is supported by the evidence of a decreasing of the\ngravity-sensitive gamma index as a function of stellar ages. The presence of\nthe age spread is also supported by the spatial distribution and the kinematics\nof old and young members. In particular, members with accretion and/or disk,\nformed in the last 1 Myr, show evidence of subclustering around the cluster\ncenter, in the Hourglass Nebula and in the M8-E region, suggesting a possible\ntriggering of star formation events by the O-type star ionization fronts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 10:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

Focusing on the simplest case of bidirectional flow regimes, we\nshow that the transition from transverse to oblique or longitudinal patterns is\ncontrolled by the transport ratio and the divergence angle between the two\nflows.

This analysis also predicts the selected pattern wavelength, which\neither decreases close to the transition angle for strong winds, due to a\ngeometric effect, or increases at low winds, when the bed slope affects the\ntransport. This theoretical analysis is complemented by analogous subaqueous\nexperiments, where bedforms are submitted to alternate water flows. For\ntransverse bedforms, the experimental data validate the model at strong flows,\nproviding evidence for the predicted geometric effect, but also for the\nincrease of the wavelength close to the transport threshold.

The microscopic\norigin of this behavior has been attributed to the mechanical action of load\ncarrying capacity. However, a recent work highlighted the importance of the\nchemical action of graphene. According to this work graphene reduces the\nadhesion of iron interfaces by reducing the surface energy thanks to a\npassivation effect. The aim of the present work is to clarify the still debated\nlubricating behavior of graphene flakes. We perform pin-on-disc experiments\nusing liquid dispersed graphene solution as a lubricant. Two different\nmaterials, pure iron and bronze are tested against 100Cr6 steel. Raman\nspectroscopy is used to analyze the surfaces after the friction tests. The\nresults of these tests prove that graphene flakes have a beneficial effect on\nthe friction coefficient. At the same time they show a tendency of graphene to\npassivate the native iron surfaces that are exposed during sliding as a\nconsequence of wear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 11:51:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

We employ a simplified 2D model in ${\\bf k}$-space to study the\nevolution of the electric-field spectrum and to calculate the relaxation time\nof the beam. We demonstrate that the 2D model is an adequate representation of\nthe 3D physics. We find that non-linear Landau damping, once it operates\nefficiently, transports essentially the entire wave energy to small wavenumbers\nwhere wave driving is weak or absent. The relaxation time also strongly depends\non the IGM temperature, $T_\\mathrm{IGM}$, and for $T_\\mathrm{IGM}\\ll10$ eV, and\nin the absence of any other damping mechanism, the relaxation time of the pair\nbeam is longer than the inverse Compton (IC) scattering time. The weak\nlate-time beam energy losses arise from the accumulation of wave energy at\nsmall $k$, that non-linearly drains the wave energy at the resonant\n$\\mathbf{k}$ of the pair-beam instability. Any other dissipation process\noperating at small $k$ would reduce that wave-energy drain and hence lead to\nstronger pair-beam energy losses. As an example, collisions reduce the\nrelaxation time by an order of magnitude, although their rate is very small.\nOther non-linear processes, such as the modulation instability, could provide\nadditional damping of the non-resonant waves and dramatically reduce the\nrelaxation time of the pair beam.

In our setting, the search domain is the set\nof planar rigid transformations and the objective function is the sum of the\ndistances between each point of the transformed source set and the destination\nset. We consider a Branch and Bound (BnB) method for finding the globally\noptimal solution. The algorithm recursively splits the search domain into boxes\nand computes an upper and a lower bound for the minimum value of the restricted\nproblem. The main contribution of this work is the introduction of a novel\nlower bound, the relaxation bound, which corresponds to the solution of a\nconcave relaxation of the objective function based on the linearization of the\ndistance. In the BnB we also employ the so called cheap bound, equal to to the\nsum of the minimum distances between each point of source point set,\ntransformed according to current box, and all the candidate points in the\ndestination point set. We prove, both theoretically and practically, that the\nnovel relaxation bound dominates the cheap bound over small boxes. More\nprecisely, from the theoretical point of view, we prove that the relaxation\nbound is a second-order approximation of the minimum value, i.e., its distance\nfrom the minimum value decreases quadratically with respect to the diameter of\nthe box (see Theorem 1), while the cheap bound is a first-order one (see\nProposition 3). From the practical point of view, we show through different\ncomputational experiments that the addition of the relaxation bound\nconsiderably enhances the performance of the BnB algorithm, compensating the\nhigher cost of its computation with respect to the cheap bound with a strong\nreduction of the number of BnB nodes to be explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 13:43:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 14:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-22"}

This mixed history of flow conditions leads to\nvery complex particle statistics with a pronounced scale dependence, which\npresents one of the major challenges on the way to a non-equilibrium\nstatistical mechanics of turbulence. Here, we introduce the notion of\npersistent Lagrangian acceleration, quantified by the squared particle\nacceleration coarse-grained over a viscous time scale.

Unlike Skrme-type models, in which\nparameters of the interaction are fit to reproduce the energy density of\nnuclear matter and/or properties of heavy nuclei, the EOS of APR is obtained\nfrom potentials resulting from fits to nucleon-nucleon scattering and\nproperties of light nuclei. In addition, this EOS features a phase transition\nto a neutral pion condensate at supra-nuclear densities. We show that\ndifferences in the effective masses between EOSs have consequences for the\nproperties of nuclei in the sub-nuclear inhomogeneous phase of matter. We also\ntest the new EOS of APR in spherically symmetric core-collapse of massive stars\nwith $15M_\\odot$ and $40M_\\odot$, respectively.

The reason for this\ndifference is that the onset of the phase transition in the EOS of APR occurs\nat larger densities than for the quark-to-hadron transition employed earlier\nwhich results in a significantly smaller softening of the high density EOS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 14:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

This work provides the first-to-date closed-form\nexpression of the probability density function (pdf) of the output ZF and MMSE\nSINR, for a wide range of fading laws, encompassing, in particular,\ncorrelations and multiple scattering effects typical of practically relevant\nchannel models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 15:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-31"}

The problem of\ncommunity detection is a twofold problem that consists of determining the\nnumber of communities and, at the same time, finding those communities. This\ndrastically increases the solution space for heuristics to work on, compared to\ntraditional graph partitioning problems.

However, the high efficiency and high density advantages of ReRAM have\nnot been fully utilized due to the huge communication demands among PEs and the\noverhead of peripheral circuits.\n  In this paper, we propose a full system stack solution, composed of a\nreconfigurable architecture design, Field Programmable Synapse Array (FPSA) and\nits software system including neural synthesizer, temporal-to-spatial mapper,\nand placement & routing. We highly leverage the software system to make the\nhardware design compact and efficient. To satisfy the high-performance\ncommunication demand, we optimize it with a reconfigurable routing architecture\nand the placement & routing tool. To improve the computational density, we\ngreatly simplify the PE circuit with the spiking schema and then adopt neural\nsynthesizer to enable the high density computation-resources to support\ndifferent kinds of NN operations. In addition, we provide spiking memory blocks\n(SMBs) and configurable logic blocks (CLBs) in hardware and leverage the\ntemporal-to-spatial mapper to utilize them to balance the storage and\ncomputation requirements of NN. Owing to the end-to-end software system, we can\nefficiently deploy existing deep neural networks to FPSA.

One\nprominent idea is the use of active sensors implemented in a commercial\nhigh-voltage CMOS process, capacitively coupled to hybrid pixel readout chips.\nRecent results have shown the approach to be feasible, though more detailed\nstudies of the performance of such devices, including simulation, are required.\nThe CLICdp collaboration has developed a number of ASICs as part of its vertex\ndetector R&D programme, and here we present results on the performance of a\nCCPDv3 active sensor glued to a CLICpix readout chip. Charge collection\ncharacteristics and tracking performance have been measured over the full\nexpected angular range of incident particles using 120 GeV/c secondary hadron\nbeams from the CERN SPS. Single hit efficiencies have been observed above 99%\nin the full range of track incidence angles, down to shallow angles. The single\nhit resolution has also been observed to be stable over this range, with a\nresolution around 6 $\\mu$m. The measured charge collection characterstics have\nbeen compared to simulations carried out using the Sentaurus TCAD\nfinite-element simulation package combined with circuit simulations and\nparametrisations of the readout chip response. The simulations have also been\nsuccessfully used to reproduce electric fields, depletion depths and the\ncurrent-voltage characteristics of the device, and have been further used to\nmake predictions about future device designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 13:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

These artifacts pose many\nreadability challenges to current text recognition algorithms and significantly\ndegrade their performance. Existing learning based denoising techniques require\na dataset comprising of noisy documents paired with cleaned versions.

From these\nnew insights into the water retained in CCs we can decipher the pathways of\ndelivery of volatiles to the terrestrial planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 13:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-04"}

Secondly, we calculated the simulation SE with three\nalgorithms for ZF and MMSE precoding. We compared the simulation and\ntheoretical results and found that the theoretical results are 1 to 1.5 bits\nless than the simulation values which implied that the theoretical lower bounds\nare actually the lower bounds. To achieve the maximum spectral efficiency in\ndownlink massive MIMO systems we assumed perfect CSI, ZF and MMSE precoding in\nthis paper. We also considered that the channel has the characteristics of\nsmall and large scale fading (SSF and LSF) as the model is like a practical. We\ninvestigated the effect of different SNR, base station (M) and radius (R) of\nthe cell on spectral efficiency for simulation and theoretical results. We also\nevaluated the performance of SE of each algorithms and precoding schemes for\ndifferent configurations. From the results we have observed that algorithms-1\nand ZF outperform other algorithms and MMSE. From our investigation we noticed\nthat the LSF parameters are the most dominated factor in SE in massive MIMO\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 05:31:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 07:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-14"}

Multi-Channel Access is a family of\nsuch multi-service solutions that enable a user equipment to aggregate radio\nresources from multiple sources. The objective is multi-fold; throughput\nenhancement through access to a larger bandwidth, reliability improvement by\nincreasing the diversity order and/or coordinated transmission/reception, as\nwell as flexibility and load balancing improvement by decoupling the downlink\nand the uplink access points. This paper presents several multi-channel access\nsolutions for 5G New Radio multi-service scenarios. In particular, throughput\nenhancement and latency reduction concepts like multi-connectivity, carrier\naggregation, downlink-uplink decoupled access and coordinated multi-point\nconnectivity are discussed. Moreover, novel design solutions exploiting these\nconcepts are proposed. Numerical evaluation of the introduced solutions\nindicates significant performance gains over state-of-the-art schemes; for\nexample, our proposed component carrier selection mechanism leads to a median\nthroughput gain of up to 100% by means of an implicit load balance. Therefore,\nthe proposed Multi-Channel Access solutions have the potential to be key\nmulti-service enablers for 5G New Radio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 12:54:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 10:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-14"}

Our technique exploits the alternating current electrothermal flow\nphenomenon which is generated due to the interaction between non-uniform\nelectric and thermal fields. Highly non-uniform electric field generates sharp\ntemperature gradients by generating spatially-varying Joule heat that varies\nalong radial direction from a concentrated point hotspot. Sharp temperature\ngradients induce local variation in electric properties which, in turn,\ngenerate strong electrothermal vortex. The imposed fluid flow brings the\ncolloidal particles at the centre of the hotspot and enables particle\naggregation. Further, manoeuvering structures of the Joule heating spots,\ndifferent patterns of particle clustering may be formed in a low power budget,\nthus, opening up a new realm of on-chip particle manipulation process without\nnecessitating highly focused laser beam which is much complicated and demands\nhigher power budget.
