Several research works have\nsuccessfully designed optimal sampling and/or control strategies under\nsimplified communication models, where transmission delays/times are negligible\nor fixed. However, considering sophisticated communication models, with random\ntransmission times, result in highly coupled and difficult-to-solve optimal\ndesign problems due to the parameter inter-dependencies between\nestimation/control and communication layers. To tackle this problem, in this\nwork, we investigate the applicability of Age-of-Information (AoI) for solving\ncontrol/estimation problems in an NCS under i.i.d. transmission times. Our\nmotivation for this investigation stems from the following facts: 1) recent\nresults indicate that AoI can be tackled under relatively sophisticated\ncommunication models, and 2) a lower AoI in an NCS may result in a lower\nestimation/control cost. We study a joint optimization of sampling and\nscheduling for a single-loop stochastic LTI networked system with the objective\nof minimizing the time-average squared norm of the estimation error. We first\nshow that under mild assumptions on information structure the optimal control\npolicy can be designed independently from the sampling and scheduling policies.\nWe then derive a key result that minimizing the estimation error is equivalent\nto minimizing a function of AoI when the sampling decisions are independent of\nthe state of the LTI system. Noting that minimizing the function of AoI is a\nstochastic combinatorial optimization problem and is hard to solve, we resort\nto heuristic algorithms obtained by extending existing algorithms in the AoI\nliterature. We also identify a class of LTI system dynamics for which\nminimizing the estimation error is equivalent to minimizing the expected AoI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jan 2019 16:16:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 15:39:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 16:26:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 13:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-08"}

The distortion of a voting rule measures the worst-case loss\nof the quality being the result of having access only to preference rankings.\nWe extend the idea of distortion to approval-based preferences. First, we\ncompute the distortion of Approval Voting. Second, we introduce the concept of\nacceptability-based distortion---the main idea behind is that the optimal\ncandidate is the one that is acceptable to most voters. We determine\nacceptability-distortion for a number of rules, including Plurality, Borda,\n$k$-Approval, Veto, the Copeland's rule, Ranked Pairs, the Schulze's method,\nand STV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jan 2019 18:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

One way to do this is to\nuse (sub)millimeter line emission from vibrationally excited HCN (HCN-vib). It\nhas been suggested that the most intense HCN-vib emission from a galaxy is\nconnected to a phase of nuclear growth that occurs before the nuclear feedback\nprocesses have been fully developed. We aim to investigate if there is a\nconnection between the presence of strong HCN-vib emission and the development\nof feedback in (U)LIRGs. We collected literature and archival data to compare\nthe luminosities of rotational lines of HCN-vib, normalized to the total\ninfrared luminosity, to the median velocities of 119 {\\mu}m OH absorption\nlines, potentially indicating outflows, in a total of 17 (U)LIRGs. The most\nHCN-vib luminous systems all lack signatures of significant molecular outflows\nin the far-infrared OH absorption lines. However, at least some of the systems\nwith bright HCN-vib emission do have fast and collimated outflows that can be\nseen in spectral lines at longer wavelengths. We conclude that the galaxy\nnuclei with the highest L(HCN-vib)/L(IR) do not drive wide-angle outflows\ndetectable using the median velocities of far-infrared OH absorption lines. It\nis possible that this is due to an orientation effect where sources which are\noriented in such a way that their outflows are not along our line of sight also\nradiate a smaller proportion of their infrared luminosity in our direction. It\ncould also be that massive wide-angle outflows destroy the deeply embedded\nregions responsible for bright HCN-vib emission, so that the two phenomena\ncannot coexist. This would strengthen the idea that vibrationally excited HCN\ntraces a heavily obscured stage of evolution before nuclear feedback mechanisms\nare fully developed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jan 2019 20:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

However, even in the complete absence of an external\nelectromagnetic field, strong-field phenomena can arise when matter strongly\ncouples with the zero-point field of the quantum vacuum state, i.e.,\nfluctuating electromagnetic waves whose expectation value is zero. Some of the\nmost striking examples of this occur in a cavity setting, in which an ensemble\nof two-level atoms resonantly interacts with a single photonic mode of vacuum\nfields, producing vacuum Rabi splitting. In particular, the nature of the\nmatter-vacuum-field coupled system fundamentally changes when the coupling rate\n(equal to one half of the vacuum Rabi splitting) becomes comparable to, or\nlarger than, the resonance frequency. In this so-called ultrastrong coupling\nregime, a non-negligible number of photons exist in the ground state of the\ncoupled system. Furthermore, the coupling rate can be cooperatively enhanced\n(via so-called Dicke cooperativity) when the matter is comprised of a large\nnumber of identical two-level particles, and a quantum phase transition is\npredicted to occur as the coupling rate reaches a critical value. Low-energy\nelectronic or magnetic transitions in many-body condensed matter systems with\nlarge dipole moments are ideally suited for searching for these predicted\nphenomena. Here, we discuss two condensed matter systems that have shown\ncooperative ultrastrong interactions in the terahertz frequency range: a\nLandau-quantized two-dimensional electron gas interacting with\nhigh-quality-factor cavity photons, and an Er$^{3+}$ spin ensemble interacting\nwith Fe$^{3+}$ magnons in ErFeO$_3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jan 2019 23:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-15"}

Consequently, a large amount of wind pressure data sets have\naccumulated, which presents an excellent opportunity for using machine learning\n(ML) techniques to train models to predict wind pressures around circular\ncylinders. Wind pressures around smooth circular cylinders are a function of\nmainly the Reynolds number (Re), turbulence intensity (Ti) of the incident\nwind, and circumferential angle of the cylinder. Considering these three\nparameters as the inputs, this study trained two ML models to predict mean and\nfluctuating pressures respectively. Three machine learning algorithms including\ndecision tree regressor, random forest, and gradient boosting regression trees\n(GBRT) were tested. The GBRT models exhibited the best performance for\npredicting both mean and fluctuating pressures, and they are capable of making\naccurate predictions for Re ranging from 10^4 to 10^6 and Ti ranging from 0% to\n15%.

Then, we train a dense-fitting network for facial region and an eye\ngaze network to regress 3D eye model parameters. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that our system can efficiently and effectively produce in real\ntime a vivid personalized 3D avatar with the correct identity, pose, expression\nand eye motion corresponding to the HMD user.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 01:58:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

Recent experiments suggest that such replicases can be\nrealized if an RNA polymerase ribozyme is divided into fragments short enough\nto be replicable by the ribozyme and if these fragments self-assemble into a\nfunctional ribozyme. However, the continued self-replication of such replicases\nrequires that the production of every essential fragment be balanced and\nsustained. Here, we use mathematical modeling to investigate whether and under\nwhat conditions fragmented replicases achieve continued self-replication. We\nfirst show that under a simple batch condition, the replicases fail to display\ncontinued self-replication owing to positive feedback inherent in these\nreplicases. This positive feedback inevitably biases replication toward a\nsubset of fragments, so that the replicases eventually fail to sustain the\nproduction of all essential fragments. We then show that this inherent\ninstability can be resolved by small rates of random content exchange between\nloose compartments (i.e., horizontal transfer). In this case, the balanced\nproduction of all fragments is achieved through negative frequency-dependent\nselection operating in the population dynamics of compartments. This selection\nmechanism arises from an interaction mediated by horizontal transfer between\nintracellular and intercellular symmetry breaking. The horizontal transfer also\nensures the presence of all essential fragments in each compartment, sustaining\nself-replication. Taken together, our results underline compartmentalization\nand horizontal transfer in the origin of the first self-replicating replicases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 02:45:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

One primary\nreason for this is the fact that most MC decomposition approaches involve a\ncomplex and inflexible methodology: decomposed subchains must be disjoint,\ntransition rates of these decomposed subchains must be altered in a way\ntailored to the particular MC model, and the procedure to aggregate suchains\nneeds to incorporate a nonlinear normalization constraint, complicating the\nanalytical expression of performance measures. In contrast, we propose a\nversatile yet simple decomposition method for continuous time MCs based on the\ntotal expectation theorem. Leveraging the properties of this theorem, our\nmethod has great flexibility in the choice of subchains, and the procedure to\nobtain expected values of interest is simply a linear summation of subchains'\nproperties, which is not affected by the normalization constraint.

To address this problem, we propose a unified framework called Dynamic\nCurriculum Learning (DCL) to online adaptively adjust the sampling strategy and\nloss learning in single batch, which resulting in better generalization and\ndiscrimination. Inspired by the curriculum learning, DCL consists of two level\ncurriculum schedulers: (1) sampling scheduler not only manages the data\ndistribution from imbalanced to balanced but also from easy to hard; (2) loss\nscheduler controls the learning importance between classification and metric\nlearning loss. Learning from these two schedulers, we demonstrate our DCL\nframework with the new state-of-the-art performance on the widely used face\nattribute dataset CelebA and pedestrian attribute dataset RAP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 03:48:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 05:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-16"}

Specifically, we propose to represent the output as an oriented level\nset of a continuous embedding function, and incorporate this in a deep\nend-to-end learning framework by introducing a variational shape inference\nformulation. We investigate the benefits of our approach on the task of 3D\nsurface prediction and demonstrate its ability to produce a more accurate\nreconstruction compared to voxel-based representations. We further show that\nour model is flexible and can be applied to a variety of shape inference\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 06:32:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

Inspired by the intrinsic\nreflection of natural images, in this paper we propose a novel feature learning\nframework for large-scale salient object detection. Specifically, we design a\nsymmetrical fully convolutional network (SFCN) to effectively learn\ncomplementary saliency features under the guidance of lossless feature\nreflection. The location information, together with contextual and semantic\ninformation, of salient objects are jointly utilized to supervise the proposed\nnetwork for more accurate saliency predictions. In addition, to overcome the\nblurry boundary problem, we propose a new weighted structural loss function to\nensure clear object boundaries and spatially consistent saliency. The coarse\nprediction results are effectively refined by these structural information for\nperformance improvements. Extensive experiments on seven saliency detection\ndatasets demonstrate that our approach achieves consistently superior\nperformance and outperforms the very recent state-of-the-art methods with a\nlarge margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 08:45:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

In this work we use\ndata from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and consider a specific\nphotospheric model, in which kinetic energy of a low-magnetisation outflow is\ndissipated locally by internal shocks below the photosphere. We construct a\ntable model with a physically motivated parameter space and fit it to\ntime-resolved spectra of the 36 brightest Fermi GRBs with known redshift. We\nfind that about two thirds of the examined spectra cannot be described by the\nmodel, as it typically under-predicts the observed flux. However, since the\nsample is strongly biased towards bright GRBs, we argue that this fraction will\nbe significantly lowered when considering the full population. From the\nsuccessful fits we find that the model can reproduce the full range of spectral\nslopes present in the sample. For these cases we also find that the dissipation\nconsistently occurs at a radius of $\\sim 10^{12}$ cm and that only a few\npercent efficiency is required. Furthermore, we find a positive correlation\nbetween the fireball luminosity and the Lorentz factor. Such a correlation has\nbeen previously reported by independent methods.

We evaluate several numerical measures\nof partial balance and recommend using the frustration index, a measure that\nsatisfies key axiomatic properties and allows us to analyse graphs based on\ntheir levels of partial balance. The exact algorithms used in the literature to\ncompute the frustration index, also called the line index of balance, are not\nscalable and cannot process graphs with a few hundred edges. We formulate\ncomputing the frustration index as a graph optimisation problem to find the\nminimum number of edges whose removal results in a balanced network given\nbinary decision variables associated with graph nodes and edges. We use our\nfirst optimisation model to analyse graphs with up to 3000 edges. Reformulating\nthe optimisation problem, we develop three more efficient binary linear\nprogramming models.

Experimentally, it means that an artery is cut\ninto rings; then the rings are cut axially: they open up into sectors; and the\ncorresponding opening angles are measured to give residual stress levels by\nsolving an inverse problem. However, in the lab, for many tissues--more\ncommonly in pathological tissues, the ring does not open according to the\ntheory, into a neat single circular sector, but rather creates an asymmetric\ngeometry, often with abruptly changing curvature(s). This phenomenon might be\ndue to a number of reasons including variation in thickness, microstructure,\nvarying mechanical properties, etc. As a result, these samples have to be\neliminated from studies relying on the opening angle method, which limits\nprogress in understanding and evaluating residual stresses in all real\narteries. With this work we propose an effective approach to deal with these\nnon-trivial openings of rings. First we digitalise pictures of opened rings to\nsplit them into multiple, connected circular sectors. Then we measure the\ncorresponding opening angles for each sub-sector.

So far, the few critical QoS papers\nhave had only a minor effect on QoS research and standardization. Therefore,\nthere is a serious risk that QoS will remain an academic research topic without\nsignificant practical relevance. To help elucidate these issues, in this work,\nwe first perform a comprehensive review of QoS including a general overview and\nan analysis of both influential and critical work from the past 30 years. We\nexamine properties such as citations, keywords, and author traits to show that\nQoS has passed through several distinct phases with different topics while\nmaintaining the overall attitude towards the role and objective of QoS systems.\nWe then discuss QoS as a social phenomenon and in the context of current\nnetworking standards. Finally, we propose a QoS scheme based on incentives that\navoids some of the problems identified in critical work, and we provide simple\nrecommendations for network operators.

These gains translate into a reach increase of approximately 16%\n(1,100 km). The proposed modulation format is also shown to be more tolerant to\nnonlinearities than PM-8QAM. Results with LDPC codes are also presented, which\nconfirm the gains predicted by the GMI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 11:10:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 01:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-07"}

Optimal solving using branch-and-bound algorithms like A* has been\nshown to be promising in the past, with a state-space model we refer to as\nexhaustive list scheduling (ELS). The obvious weakness of this model is that it\nleads to the production of large numbers of duplicate states during a search,\nrequiring special techniques to mitigate this which cost additional time and\nmemory. In this paper we define a new state-space model (AO) in which we divide\nthe problem into two distinct sub-problems: first we decide the allocations of\nall tasks to processors, and then we order the tasks on their allocated\nprocessors in order to produce a complete schedule. This two-phase state-space\nmodel offers no potential for the production of duplicates. We also describe\nhow the pruning techniques and optimisations developed for the ELS model were\nadapted or made obsolete by the AO model. An experimental evaluation shows that\nthe use of this new state-space model leads to a significant increase in the\nnumber of task graphs able to be scheduled within a feasible time-frame,\nparticularly for task graphs with a high communication-to-computation ratio.\nFinally, some advanced lower bound heuristics are proposed for the AO model,\nand evaluation demonstrates that significant gains can be achieved from the\nconsideration of necessary idle time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 12:12:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

Recent examples are the\ndestructive earthquakes of L'Aquila Mw 6.1 2009 and Norcia Mw 6.5 2016 in\nCentral Italy. Surprisingly, within this region, fast (\\approx 3km/s) and\ndestructive seismic ruptures coexist with slow (maximum 10 m/s) and\nnon-destructive rupture phenomena. Despite of its relevance for seismic hazard\nstudies, the transitions from fault creep to slow and fast seismic rupture\npropagation are still poorly constrained by seismological and laboratory\nobservations. Here, we reproduced in the laboratory the complete spectrum of\nnatural faulting on samples of dolostones representative of the seismogenic\nlayer in the region. The transitions from fault creep to slow ruptures and from\nslow to fast ruptures, are obtained by increasing both confining pressure (P)\nand temperature (T) up to conditions encountered at 3-5 km depth (i.e., P = 100\nMPa and T = 100 $^{o}$C), which corresponds to the hypocentral location of slow\nearthquake swarms and the onset of regular seismicity in Central Italy. The\ntransition from slow to fast rupture is explained by the increase of the\nambient temperature, which enhances the elastic loading stiffness of the fault\nand consequently the slip velocity during the nucleation stage, allowing flash\nweakening. The activation of such weakening induces the propagation of fast\nruptures radiating intense high frequency seismic waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 12:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

However, if one can increase the magnetic\npower density of light by several orders of magnitude, the coupling between\nmagnetic light and matter could become of the same order of magnitude as the\ncoupling with its electric counterpart. For that purpose, photonic nanoantennas\nhave been proposed, and in particular dielectric nanostructures, to engineer\nstrong local magnetic field and therefore increase the probability of magnetic\ninteractions. Unfortunately, dielectric designs suffer from physical\nlimitations that confine the magnetic hot spot in the core of the material\nitself, preventing experimental and technological implementations. Here, we\ndemonstrate that evolutionary algorithms can overcome such limitations by\ndesigning new dielectric photonic nanoantennas, able to increase and extract\nthe optical magnetic field from high refractive index materials.

How TORC2\nactivity is modulated in response to changes in the status of the cell envelope\nis unclear. Here we document that TORC2 subunit Avo2 is a direct target of\nSlt2, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) of the cell wall integrity\npathway. Activation of Slt2 by overexpression of a constitutively active allele\nof an upstream Slt2 activator (Pkc1) or by auxin-induced degradation of a\nnegative Slt2 regulator (Sln1) caused hyperphosphorylation of Avo2 at its MAPK\nphosphoacceptor sites in a Slt2-dependent manner and diminished TORC2-mediated\nphosphorylation of its major downstream effector, protein kinase Ypk1. Deletion\nof Avo2 or expression of a phosphomimetic Avo2 allele rendered cells sensitive\nto two stresses (myriocin treatment and elevated exogenous acetic acid) that\nthe cell requires Ypk1 activation by TORC2 to survive. Thus, Avo2 is necessary\nfor optimal TORC2 activity, and Slt2-mediated phosphorylation of Avo2\ndown-regulates TORC2 signaling. Compared with wild-type Avo2, phosphomimetic\nAvo2 shows significant displacement from the plasma membrane, suggesting that\nSlt2 inhibits TORC2 by promoting Avo2 dissociation. Our findings are the first\ndemonstration that TORC2 function is regulated by MAPK-mediated\nphosphorylation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 15:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

Here we probe the relation between control and dynamics in\nbrain networks constructed from diffusion tensor imaging data in a large\ncommunity based sample of young adults.

Thus, the convectional channel training\nprotocol using pilot tones could be attacked and paralyzed, which raises the\nissue of anti-attack channel training authentication (CTA), i.e., verifying the\nclaims of identities of pilot tones and channel estimation samples. In this\npaper, we consider one-ring scattering scenarios with large-scale uniform\nlinear arrays (ULA) and develop an independence-checking coding (ICC) theory to\nbuild a secure and stable CTA protocol, namely, ICC-based CTA (ICC-CTA)\nprotocol. In this protocol, the pilot tones are not only merely randomized and\ninserted into subcarriers but also encoded as diversified subcarrier activation\npatterns (SAPs) simultaneously. Those encoded SAPs, though camouflaged by\nmalicious signals, can be identified and decoded into original pilots for\nhigh-accuracy channel impulse response (CIR) estimation. The CTA security is\nfirst characterized by the error probability of identifying legitimate CIR\nestimation samples. The CTA instability is formulated as the function of\nprobability of stably estimating CIR against all available diversified SAPs. A\nrealistic tradeoff between the CTA security and instability under the\ndiscretely distributed AoA is identified and an optimally stable tradeoff\nproblem is formulated, with the objective of optimizing the code rate to\nmaximize security while maintaining maximum stability for ever. Solving this,\nwe derive the closed-form expression of optimal code rate.

The former variation tackles the issue of\noverestimation of clicks in the original CTR while the latter accounts for\nnoting purchases of products that have been previously clicked, in order to\nvalidate that the buy included in the metric is a result of customer\ninteractions. A significance test for independence of two means is conducted\nfor multiple datasets, between each of the new metrics and its respective\nparent to determine the novelty and necessity of the variants.

Instead of\nindividually selective units with classes, the RS refers to the independence of\na unit's representations in the same layer without any annotation. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that interpretable units have high RS which are not\ncritical to network's generalization. The RS provides new insights into the\ninterpretation of DNNs and suggests that we need to focus on the independence\nand relationship of the representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jan 2019 18:49:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-14"}
