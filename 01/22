The significance of this type of topological\nvector spaces is illustrated by the fact that the underlying vector space of\nthe Lie algebra of any pro-Lie group is weakly complete. In this study, weakly\ncomplete real or complex associative algebras are studied because they are\nnecessarily projective limits of finite dimensional algebras. The group of\nunits $A^{-1}$ of a weakly complete algebra $A$ is a pro-Lie group with the\nassociated topological Lie algebra $A_{\\rm Lie}$ of $A$ as Lie algebra and the\nglobally defined exponential function $\\exp\\colon A\\to A^{-1}$ as the\nexponential function of $A^{-1}$.

SR techniques are often supervised, requiring\naligned pairs of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) images patches to\ntrain a model.

For this\nreason, we propose an unsupervised SR framework based on an adversarial deep\nneural network with a physically-inspired cycle consistency, designed to impose\nsome acquisition properties on the super-resolved images.

For example,\nan image of a cat can be labeled as \"cat\" or perhaps more specifically \"Persian\ncat.\" We refer to this as label granularity. In this paper, we conduct\nextensive experiments using various datasets to demonstrate and analyze how and\nwhy training based on fine-grain labeling, such as \"Persian cat\" can improve\nCNN accuracy on classifying coarse-grain classes, in this case \"cat.\" The\nexperimental results show that training CNNs with fine-grain labels improves\nboth network's optimization and generalization capabilities, as intuitively it\nencourages the network to learn more features, and hence increases\nclassification accuracy on coarse-grain classes under all datasets considered.\nMoreover, fine-grain labels enhance data efficiency in CNN training. For\nexample, a CNN trained with fine-grain labels and only 40% of the total\ntraining data can achieve higher accuracy than a CNN trained with the full\ntraining dataset and coarse-grain labels. These results point to two possible\napplications of this work: (i) with sufficient human resources, one can improve\nCNN performance by re-labeling the dataset with fine-grain labels, and (ii)\nwith limited human resources, to improve CNN performance, rather than\ncollecting more training data, one may instead use fine-grain labels for the\ndataset.

In embryogenesis the interplay between\nCa2+ signalling and mechanical forces is critical to the healthy development of\nan embryo but poorly understood. Several types of embryonic cells exhibit\ncalcium-induced contractions and many experiments indicate that Ca2+ signals\nand contractions are coupled via a two-way mechanochemical coupling. We present\na new analysis of experimental data that supports the existence of this\ncoupling during Apical Constriction in Neural Tube Closure. We then propose a\nmechanochemical model, building on early models that couple Ca2+ dynamics to\ncell mechanics and replace the bistable Ca2+ release with modern,\nexperimentally validated Ca2+ dynamics. We assume that the cell is a linear\nviscoelastic material and model the Ca2+-induced contraction stress with a Hill\nfunction saturating at high Ca2+ levels. We also express, for the first time,\nthe \"stretch-activation\" Ca2+ flux in the early mechanochemical models as a\nbottom-up contribution from stretch-sensitive Ca2+ channels on the cell\nmembrane. We reduce the model to three ordinary differential equations and\nanalyse its bifurcation structure semi-analytically as the $IP_3$\nconcentration, and the \"strength\" of stretch activation, $\\lambda$ vary. The\nCa2+ system ($\\lambda=0$, no mechanics) exhibits relaxation oscillations for a\ncertain range of $IP_3$ values. As $\\lambda$ is increased the range of $IP_3$\nvalues decreases, the oscillation amplitude decreases and the frequency\nincreases. Oscillations vanish for a sufficiently high value of $\\lambda$.\nThese results agree with experiments in embryonic cells that also link the loss\nof Ca2+ oscillations to embryo abnormalities. The work addresses a very\nimportant and understudied question on the coupling of chemical and mechanical\nsignalling in embryogenesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 18:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

By virtue of the all-to-all\nnature of its center-of-mass conserving interactions, the model lacks dynamical\nspectral weight transfer, which is the key to intractability of the Hubbard\nmodel for $d>1$. In order to maintain a non-trivial Mott-like electron\npropagator, SU(2) symmetry is preserved in the Hamiltonian, leading to a ground\nstate that is mixed on both sides of the phase transition. Because of this\nmixture, even the metal in this model is unentangled between any pair of sites,\nunlike free fermions whose ground state carries a filling-dependent site-site\nentanglement. We focus on the scaling behavior of the one- and two-site\nentropies $s_1$ and $s_2$, as well as the entropy density $s$, of the ground\nstate near the Mott transition. At low temperatures in the two-dimensional\nHubbard model, it was observed numerically (Walsh et al., 2018,\narXiv:1807.10409) that $s_1$ and $s$ increase continuously into the metal,\nacross a first-order Mott transition.

The ground\nstate's non-trivial entanglement structure is manifest in $s_2$ and $s$ which\ndecrease into the metal, and thereby act as sharp signals of the Mott\ntransition in any dimension.

Here, we investigate how to\nsubstantially improve the galaxy classification within large datasets by\nmimicking human classification. We combine accurate visual classifications from\nthe Galaxy Zoo project with machine and deep learning methodologies. We propose\ntwo distinct approaches for galaxy morphology: one based on non-parametric\nmorphology and traditional machine learning algorithms; and another based on\nDeep Learning. To measure the input features for the traditional machine\nlearning methodology, we have developed a system called CyMorph, with a novel\nnon-parametric approach to study galaxy morphology. The main datasets employed\ncomes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7). We also\ndiscuss the class imbalance problem considering three classes. Performance of\neach model is mainly measured by Overall Accuracy (OA). A spectroscopic\nvalidation with astrophysical parameters is also provided for Decision Tree\nmodels to assess the quality of our morphological classification. In all of our\nsamples, both Deep and Traditional Machine Learning approaches have over 94.5%\nOA to classify galaxies in two classes (elliptical and spiral). We compare our\nclassification with state-of-the-art morphological classification from\nliterature. Considering only two classes separation, we achieve 99% of overall\naccuracy in average when using our deep learning models, and 82% when using\nthree classes. We provide a catalog with 670,560 galaxies containing our best\nresults, including morphological metrics and classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 19:23:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 13:43:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Jun 2019 22:38:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 14:37:28 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 20:37:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

Direct simulations\nof this turbulence that include both ion and electron space-time scales\nindicate that there can be significant interactions between the two scales. The\nextreme computational expense and complexity of these direct simulations\nmotivates the desire for reduced treatment. By exploiting the scale separation\nbetween ion and electron scales,and expanding the gyrokinetic equations for the\nturbulence in $(m_e/m_i)^{1/2}$, we derive such a reduced system of gyrokinetic\nequations that describes cross-scale interactions. The coupled gyrokinetic\nequations contain novel terms which provide candidate mechanisms for the\nobserved cross-scale interaction. The electron scale turbulence experiences a\nmodified drive due to gradients in the ion scale distribution function, and is\nadvected by the ion scale $E \\times B$ drift, which varies in the direction\nparallel to the magnetic field line. The largest possible cross-scale term in\nthe ion scale equations is sub-dominant in our $(m_e/m_i)^{1/2}$ expansion.\nHence, in our model the ion scale turbulence evolves independently of the\nelectron scale turbulence. To complete the scale-separated approach, we provide\nand justify a parallel boundary condition for the coupled gyrokinetic equations\nin axisymmetric equilibria based on the standard \"twist-and-shift\" boundary\ncondition.

It uses a\nmachine learning model to forecast the utility of these changes, and\ncontinuously refines the index configuration of the database to handle evolving\nworkloads. We introduce a lightweight hybrid scan operator with which a DBMS\ncan make use of partially-built indexes for query processing. Our evaluation\nshows that predictive indexing improves the throughput of a DBMS by 3.5--5.2x\ncompared to other state-of-the-art indexing approaches. We demonstrate that\npredictive indexing works seamlessly with other lightweight automated physical\ndesign tuning methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 20:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

In a real-world\nIoT, due to the possibly different dynamics of each physical process, the sizes\nof the status updates for different devices are often different and each status\nupdate typically requires multiple transmission slots. By taking into account\nsuch multi-time slot transmissions with non-uniform sizes of the status updates\nunder noisy channels, the problem of joint device scheduling and status\nsampling is studied in order to minimize the average age of information (AoI)\nat the destination. This stochastic problem is formulated as an infinite\nhorizon average cost Markov decision process (MDP). The monotonicity of the\nvalue function of the MDP is characterized and then used to show that the\noptimal scheduling and sampling policy is threshold-based with respect to the\nAoI at each device. To overcome the curse of dimensionality, a low-complexity\nsuboptimal policy is proposed through a semi-randomized base policy and linear\napproximated value functions. The proposed suboptimal policy is shown to\nexhibit a similar structure to the optimal policy, which provides a structural\nbase for its effective performance. A structure-aware algorithm is then\ndeveloped to obtain the suboptimal policy. The analytical results are further\nextended to the IoT monitoring system with random status update arrivals, for\nwhich, the optimal scheduling and sampling policy is also shown to be\nthreshold-based with the AoI at each device. Simulation results illustrate the\nstructures of the optimal policy and show a near-optimal AoI performance\nresulting from the proposed suboptimal solution approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 20:29:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 15:24:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 18:33:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 16:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-27"}

The question if and up to which temperature\ncharacteristic features of the zero-temperature phases persist is relevant in\nexperimental realizations. We investigate a two-leg ladder lattice in a uniform\nmagnetic field and concentrate our study on chiral edge currents and\nmomentum-distribution functions, which are key observables in ultracold\nquantum-gas experiments. These quantities are computed for hard-core bosons as\nwell as noninteracting bosons and spinless fermions at zero and finite\ntemperatures.

Our main results concern the\nvortex-fluid-to-Meissner crossover of strongly interacting bosons. We\ndemonstrate that signatures of the vortex-fluid phase can still be detected at\nelevated temperatures from characteristic finite-momentum maxima in the\nmomentum-distribution functions, while the vortex-fluid phase leaves weaker\nfingerprints in the local rung currents and the chiral edge current.

The observations from 9 of the top\nprograms (in terms of number of distinct NEAs observed) and the smaller but\ndeeper DECam NEO Survey are used, comprising 74696 measurements of 13466 NEAs\nobserved within 30 deg of opposition.

Using the\ndark matter (DM) model for the Milky Way (MW) halo relative to the Galactic\nbulge/disk models, we obtain the tightest upper bound on the PBH abundance in\nthe mass range $M_{\\rm PBH}\\simeq[10^{-6},10^{-3}]M_\\odot$ (Earth-Jupiter mass\nrange), if we employ null hypothesis that the OGLE data does not contain any\nPBH microlensing event. More interestingly, we also show that Earth-mass PBHs\ncan well reproduce the 6 ultrashort-timescale events, without the need of\nfree-floating planets, if the mass fraction of PBH to DM is at a per cent\nlevel, which is consistent with other constraints such as the microlensing\nsearch for Andromeda galaxy (M31) and the longer timescale OGLE events. Our\nresult gives a hint of PBH existence, and can be confirmed or falsified by\nmicrolensing search for stars in M31, because M31 is towards the MW halo\ndirection and should therefore contain a much less number of free-floating\nplanets, even if exist, than the direction to the MW center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 23:39:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2019 13:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-23"}

Most existing works deem this 'good'\nembedding just to be the discriminative one and thus race to devise powerful\nmetric objectives or hard-sample mining strategies for leaning discriminative\nembedding. However, in this paper, we first emphasize that the generalization\nability is a core ingredient of this 'good' embedding as well and largely\naffects the metric performance in zero-shot settings as a matter of fact. Then,\nwe propose the Energy Confused Adversarial Metric Learning(ECAML) framework to\nexplicitly optimize a robust metric. It is mainly achieved by introducing an\ninteresting Energy Confusion regularization term, which daringly breaks away\nfrom the traditional metric learning idea of discriminative objective devising,\nand seeks to 'confuse' the learned model so as to encourage its generalization\nability by reducing overfitting on the seen classes. We train this confusion\nterm together with the conventional metric objective in an adversarial manner.\nAlthough it seems weird to 'confuse' the network, we show that our ECAML indeed\nserves as an efficient regularization technique for metric learning and is\napplicable to various conventional metric methods. This paper empirically and\nexperimentally demonstrates the importance of learning embedding with good\ngeneralization, achieving state-of-the-art performances on the popular CUB,\nCARS, Stanford Online Products and In-Shop datasets for ZSRC tasks.\n\\textcolor[rgb]{1, 0, 0}{Code available at http://www.bhchen.cn/}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 04:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

Furthermore, the\nuse of 3D visual representations has shown to be capable of representing the\nsimilarity and association between words. The proposed word representation\nshows a Spearman correlation score of 0.886 and provided the best results when\ncompared to the current state-of-the-art methods, and exceed the human\nperformance of 0.78.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 05:31:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

In a flowing dusty plasma medium, vortices of\ndifferent sizes appear when the flow does not remain laminar. The vortices also\nmerge to transfer energy between different scales. In the present work, we\nstudy the effect of viscoelasticity and compressibility over a localized vortex\nstructure and multiple rotational vortexes in a strongly coupled viscoelastic\ndusty plasma medium. In case of single rotating vortex flow, a transverse wave\nis generated from the localized vortex source and the evolution time of\ngenerated waves is found to be reduced due to finite viscoelasticity and\ncompressibility of the medium. It is found that the viscoelasticity suppresses\nthe dispersion of vorticity. In the presence of multiple vortices, we find, the\nvortex mergers get highly affected in the presence of memory effect of the\nfluid, and thus the dynamics of the medium gets completely altered compared to\na non-viscoelastic fluid. For a compressible fluid, viscoelasticity damps out\nthe energy in the sonic waves generated in the medium. Thus a highly\nviscoelastic and compressible fluid, in some cases, behaves similarly to an\nincompressible viscoelastic fluid. The wave-front like rings propagate in\nelliptical orbits keeping the footprint of the earlier position of the\npoint-vortex. The rings collide with each other even within the patch vortex\nregion forming regions of high vorticity at the point of intersection and pass\nthrough each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 08:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

Recently, deep learning has greatly improved the state-of-the-art\nmethod in automatic segmentation. However, limitations in data availability in\nthe medical field can cause large variance and consequent overfitting to\nmedical image segmentation networks. In this study, we propose methods to\nreduce the model variance of a rectal cancer segmentation network by adding a\nrectum segmentation task and performing data augmentation; the geometric\ncorrelation between the rectum and rectal cancer motivated the former approach.\nMoreover, we propose a method to perform a bias-variance analysis within an\narbitrary region-of-interest (ROI) of a segmentation network, which we applied\nto assess the efficacy of our approaches in reducing model variance. As a\nresult, adding a rectum segmentation task reduced the model variance of the\nrectal cancer segmentation network within tumor regions by a factor of 0.90;\ndata augmentation further reduced the variance by a factor of 0.89.

Each task of a scientific workflow requires several large datasets\nthat are located in different datacenters from the cloud computing environment,\nresulting in serious data transmission delays. Edge computing reduces the data\ntransmission delays and supports the fixed storing manner for scientific\nworkflow private datasets, but there is a bottleneck in its storage capacity.\nIt is a challenge to combine the advantages of both edge computing and cloud\ncomputing to rationalize the data placement of scientific workflow, and\noptimize the data transmission time across different datacenters. Traditional\ndata placement strategies maintain load balancing with a given number of\ndatacenters, which results in a large data transmission time. In this study, a\nself-adaptive discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm with genetic\nalgorithm operators (GA-DPSO) was proposed to optimize the data transmission\ntime when placing data for a scientific workflow. This approach considered the\ncharacteristics of data placement combining edge computing and cloud computing.\nIn addition, it considered the impact factors impacting transmission delay,\nsuch as the band-width between datacenters, the number of edge datacenters, and\nthe storage capacity of edge datacenters. The crossover operator and mutation\noperator of the genetic algorithm were adopted to avoid the premature\nconvergence of the traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm, which\nenhanced the diversity of population evolution and effectively reduced the data\ntransmission time. The experimental results show that the data placement\nstrategy based on GA-DPSO can effectively reduce the data transmission time\nduring workflow execution combining edge computing and cloud computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 09:04:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 06:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-25"}

In this split regime, the order\nof the transitions depends sensitively on the deviation from $J_2^*$ and\n$J_2^{**}$, with split second-order transitions predominating for $J_2^* \\ll\nJ_2 \\ll J_2^{**}$.

Automatic checkout (ACO) is one of\nthe critical problems in this area which aims to automatically generate the\nshopping list from the images of the products to purchase. The main challenge\nof this problem comes from the large scale and the fine-grained nature of the\nproduct categories as well as the difficulty for collecting training images\nthat reflect the realistic checkout scenarios due to continuous update of the\nproducts. Despite its significant practical and research value, this problem is\nnot extensively studied in the computer vision community, largely due to the\nlack of a high-quality dataset. To fill this gap, in this work we propose a new\ndataset to facilitate relevant research. Our dataset enjoys the following\ncharacteristics: (1) It is by far the largest dataset in terms of both product\nimage quantity and product categories. (2) It includes single-product images\ntaken in a controlled environment and multi-product images taken by the\ncheckout system. (3) It provides different levels of annotations for the\ncheck-out images. Comparing with the existing datasets, ours is closer to the\nrealistic setting and can derive a variety of research problems. Besides the\ndataset, we also benchmark the performance on this dataset with various\napproaches.

Here we study the signature of co-orbital exoplanets in transit surveys\nwhen two planet candidates in the system orbit the star with similar periods.\nSuch pair of candidates could be discarded as false positives because they are\nnot Hill-stable. However, horseshoe or long libration period tadpole co-orbital\nconfigurations can explain such period similarity. This degeneracy can be\nsolved by considering the Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) of each planet. We\nthen focus on the three planet candidates system TOI-178: the two outer\ncandidates of that system have similar orbital period and had an angular\nseparation near $\\pi/3$ during the TESS observation of sector 2. Based on the\nannounced orbits, the long-term stability of the system requires the two\nclose-period planets to be co-orbitals. Our independent detrending and transit\nsearch recover and slightly favour the three orbits close to a 3:2:2 resonant\nchain found by the TESS pipeline, although we cannot exclude an alias that\nwould put the system close to a 4:3:2 configuration. We then analyse in more\ndetail the co-orbital scenario. We show that despite the influence of an inner\nplanet just outside the 2:3 mean-motion resonance, this potential co-orbital\nsystem can be stable on the Giga-year time-scale for a variety of planetary\nmasses, either on a trojan or a horseshoe orbit. We predict that large TTVs\nshould arise in such configuration with a period of several hundred days. We\nthen show how the mass of each planet can be retrieved from these TTVs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 10:40:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

We recently suggested a new method for\nplanning paths allowing the inspection of complex 3D structures, given a\ntriangular mesh model of the structure. The method differs from previous\napproaches in its emphasis on generating and considering also plans that result\nin imperfect coverage of the inspection target. In many practical tasks, one\nwould accept imperfections in coverage if this results in a substantially more\nenergy efficient inspection path. The key idea is using a multiobjective\nevolutionary algorithm to optimize the energy usage and coverage of inspection\nplans simultaneously - and the result is a set of plans exploring the different\nways to balance the two objectives. We here test our method on a set of\ninspection targets with large variation in size and complexity, and compare its\nperformance with two state-of-the-art methods for complete coverage path\nplanning. The results strengthen our confidence in the ability of our method to\ngenerate good inspection plans for different types of targets. The method's\nadvantage is most clearly seen for real-world inspection targets, since\ntraditional complete coverage methods have no good way of generating plans for\nstructures with hidden parts. Multiobjective evolution, by optimizing energy\nusage and coverage together ensures a good balance between the two - both when\n100% coverage is feasible, and when large parts of the object are hidden.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 11:42:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

We also report on the\ndetection of the first-ever microlensing space-parallax between the Earth and\nGaia located at L2. The properties of the binary system were derived from\nmicrolensing parameters, and we found that the system is composed of two\nmain-sequence stars with masses 0.57$\\pm$0.05 $M_\\odot$ and 0.36$\\pm$0.03\n$M_\\odot$ at 780 pc, with an orbital period of 2.88 years and an eccentricity\nof 0.30.

In CeMm-RANs,\nenhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs), which are equipped with local cache and\nbaseband signal processing capabilities in addition to the basic\nfunctionalities of conventional RRHs, are connected to the baseband processing\nunit via fronthaul links. Two different fronthaul information transfer\nstrategies are considered, namely, hard fronthaul information transfer, where\nhard information of uncached requested files is transmitted via the fronthaul\nlinks to a subset of eRRHs, and soft fronthaul information transfer, where the\nfronthaul links are used to transmit quantized baseband signals of uncached\nrequested files. The hybrid precoder is optimized for maximization of the\nminimum user rate under a fronthaul capacity constraint, an eRRH transmit power\nconstraint, and a constant-modulus constraint on the analog precoder. The\nresulting optimization problem is non-convex, and hence the global optimal\nsolution is difficult to obtain. Therefore, convex approximation methods are\nemployed to tackle the non-convexity of the achievable user rate, the fronthaul\ncapacity constraint, and the constant modulus constraint on the analog\nprecoder.

Some architectures incorporate\nmethods to reduce RNN state updates, therefore allowing the network to preserve\nmemory over long temporal intervals. To address these problems of convergence,\nthis paper proposes a timing-gated LSTM RNN model, called the Gaussian-gated\nLSTM (g-LSTM). The time gate controls when a neuron can be updated during\ntraining, enabling longer memory persistence and better error-gradient flow.\nThis model captures long-temporal dependencies better than an LSTM and the time\ngate parameters can be learned even from non-optimal initialization values.\nBecause the time gate limits the updates of the neuron state, the number of\ncomputes needed for the network update is also reduced. By adding a\ncomputational budget term to the training loss, we can obtain a network which\nfurther reduces the number of computes by at least 10x. Finally, by employing a\ntemporal curriculum learning schedule for the g-LSTM, we can reduce the\nconvergence time of the equivalent LSTM network on long sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 14:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

In this workflow, documents\nare analyzed relevance with a user-specified interestingness function, on which\nthey are ranked, the top-$K$ being selected (and hence stored) for further\nprocessing. This workflow allows human in the loop systems, including\nsupervised machine learning, to prioritize documents.

The\ndependence of critical Re on n for the confined (finite b) flow are, however,\ncompletely opposite to that for unconfined flow, i.e., critical Re decreased\nwith increasing n.

Using the Chandra ACIS-S 741 ks\neffective exposure data and an advanced adaptive binning algorithm, we analyse\nthe spectra from tessellated regions in Kepler's SNR. For the first time, we\nmap out the detailed spatial distributions of emission measure (EM), electron\ntemperature, ionization parameter, and metal abundances for both the low- and\nhigh-temperature plasma components. The low-temperature plasma diverges into\ntwo branches in the temperature v.s. ionization parameter diagram, which appear\nto be spatially associated with the warm CSM dusts and the Si- and S-rich\nejecta, respectively. We construct the probability distribution functions of\nabundance ratios of O and Mg to L-shell emitting Fe ([O]/[Fe]$_{\\rm L}$ and\n[Mg]/[Fe]$_{\\rm L}$), and fit them with double Gaussians.

Before assembly with nucleotides, in the pre-RNA era, what\nsystem dominated heredity? What was the subject of survival competition? Is it\nstill a subject of competition? Self-organized complex systems are hypothesized\nto be a primary factor of the origin of life and to dominate heritability,\nmediating the partitioning of an equal distribution of structures and molecules\nat cell division. The degree of strength of self-organization would correlate\nwith heritability; self-organization is known to be a physical basis of\nhysteresis phenomena, and the degree of hysteresis is quantifiable. However,\nthere is no argument corroborating the relationship between heritability and\nhysteresis. Here, we show that the degree of cellular hysteresis indicates its\nheritability and daughter equivalence at cell division. We found a correlation\nbetween thermal hysteresis in cell size and heritability, which quantified cell\nline generation stability, suggesting that the self-organized complex system is\na subject of survival competition, comparable to nucleotides. Furthermore, in\nsingle-cell-resolution observations, we found that thermal hysteresis in cell\nsize indicates equivalent partitioning in future cell division. Our results\ndemonstrate that self-organized complex systems contribute to heredity and are\nstill important in mammalian cells. Predicting the cell line generational\nstability required for the industrial production of therapeutic biologics is\nuseful.

We report observations from the Ukrainian T-shaped Radio\ntelescope, (UTR-2), and the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) which give us new\ninsight into their nature. Methods. Over 3000 S-bursts were observed on 9 July\n2013 at frequencies of 17.4-83.1 MHz during a period of low solar activity.\nLeading models of S-burst generation were tested by analysing the spectral\nproperties of S-bursts and estimating coronal magnetic field strengths.\nResults. S-bursts were found to have short durations of 0.5-0.9 s. Multiple\ninstruments were used to measure the dependence of drift rate on frequency\nwhich is represented by a power law with an index of 1.57.

The\nIB/WSI methodology is enabled by combining the distributed Lagrange multiplier\n(DLM) method of Sharma and Patankar (J Comp Phys, 2005) with a robust level set\nmethod based multiphase flow solver. The fluid solver integrates the\nconservative form of the variable-coefficient incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations using a hybrid preconditioner and ensures consistent transport of\nmass and momentum at a discrete level. The consistent transport scheme\npreserves the numerical stability of the method in the presence of large\ndensity ratios found in problems involving air, water, and an immersed\nstructure. The air-water interface is captured by the level set method on an\nEulerian grid, whereas the free-surface piercing immersed structure is\nrepresented on a Lagrangian mesh.

The radiation field is calculated by considering\nan optically thick, geometrically thin, standard accretion disk as the emitter\nof UV photons and a spherical central object as a source of X-ray emission. In\nthe present analysis, the UV emission from the accretion disk is assumed to\nhave an angular dependence, while the X-ray/central object radiation is assumed\nto be isotropic. This allows us to build streamlines in any angular direction\nwe need to. The influence of both types of radiation is evaluated for different\nflux fractions of the X-ray and UV emissions with and without the effects of\nspectral line driving. We find that the radiation emitted near the SMBH\ninteracts with the infalling matter and modifies the accretion dynamics. In the\npresence of line driving, a transition resembles from pure type 1 & 2 to type 5\nsolutions (see Fig2.1 of Frank etal. 2002), which takes place regardless of\nwhether or not the UV emission dominates over the X-ray emission.

However, there has been limited research on how well\nthese virtual testbeds match their physical counterparts. Specifically, does\nthe virtualization that these testbeds depend on actually capture real-world\nbehaviors sufficiently well to support decisions? As a first step, we perform\nsimple experiments on both physical and virtual testbeds to begin to understand\nwhere and how the testbeds differ. We set up a web service on one host and run\nApacheBench against this service from a different host, instrumenting each\nsystem during these tests. We define an initial repeatable methodology to\nquantitatively compare testbeds. Specifically, we compare the testbeds at three\nlevels of abstraction: application, operating system (OS) and network. For the\napplication level, we use the ApacheBench results. For OS behavior, we compare\npatterns of system call orderings using Markov chains. This provides a unique\nvisual representation of the workload and OS behavior in our testbeds. We also\ndrill down into read-system-call behaviors and show how at one level both\nsystems are deterministic and identical, but as we move up in abstractions that\nconsistency declines. Finally, we use packet captures to compare network\nbehaviors and performance. We reconstruct flows and compare per-flow and\nper-experiment statistics. We find that the behavior of the workload in the\ntestbeds is similar but that the underlying processes to support it do vary.\nThe low-level network behavior can vary widely in packetization depending on\nthe virtual network driver. While these differences can be important, and\nknowing about them will help experiment designers, the core application and OS\nbehaviors still represent similar processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 18:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-07"}

In\nthis paper, the PUEA is detected and localized using the\nTime-Difference-Of-Arrival (TDOA) localization technique. Particle Swarm\nOptimization (PSO) algorithms are proposed to solve the cost function of TDOA\nmeasurements. The PSO variants are developed by changing the parameters of the\nstandard PSO such as inertia weight and acceleration constants. These\napproaches are presented and compared with the standard PSO in terms of\nconvergence speed and processing time. This paper presents the first study of\ndesigning a PSO algorithm suitable for the localization problem and will be\nconsidered as a good guidance for applying the optimization algorithms in\nwireless positioning techniques. Mean square error (MSE) and cumulative\ndistribution function (CDF) are used as the evaluation metrics to measure the\naccuracy of the proposed algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed\nPSO approaches provide higher accuracy and faster convergence than the standard\nPSO and the Taylor series estimation (TSE).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 13:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-07"}

These systems, operating in\nunstructured, public real-world environments (the operational design domain can\nbe characterized as open context) per se bear a serious safety risk. The\nserious safety risk, the complexity of the necessary technical systems, the\nopenness of the operational design domain and the regulatory situation pose a\nfundamental challenge to the automotive industry.\n  Many different approaches to the validation of autonomous driving functions\nhave been proposed over the course of the last years. However, although partly\nannounced as the solution to the validation challenge, many of the praised\napproaches leave open crucial parts.\n  To illustrate the contributions as well as the limitations of the individual\napproaches and providing strategies for 'viable' validation and approval of\nsuch systems, the first part of the paper gives an analysis of the fundamental\nchallenges related to the valid design and operation of complex autonomous\nsystems operating in open contexts. In the second part, we formalize the\nproblem statement and provide algorithms for an iterative development and\nvalidation. In the last part we give a high level overview of a practical,\nholistic development process which we refer to as systematic, system view based\napproach to validation (in short sys2val) and comment on the contributions from\nISO26262 and current state of ISO/PAS 21448 (SOTIF).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 09:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-28"}

Zenneck waves\nare excited at interfaces, like surface plasmons and have the potential to\ndeliver electrical power to devices placed on a conducting surface. Here, we\ndemonstrate, efficient and long range delivery of electrical power by exciting\nnonradiative waves over metal surfaces to multiple loads. Our modeling and\nsimulation using Maxwells equation with proper boundary conditions shows\nZenneck type behavior for the excited waves and are in excellent agreement with\nexperimental results.

Online controlled experiments (aka AB tests) are\nincreasingly being used to make decisions to improve websites as well as mobile\nand desktop applications. We argue that loss of telemetry data (during upload\nor post-processing) can skew the results of experiments, leading to loss of\nstatistical power and inaccurate or erroneous conclusions. By systematically\ninvestigating the causes of telemetry loss, we argue that it is not practical\nto entirely eliminate it. Consequently, experimentation systems need to be\nrobust to its effects. Furthermore, we note that it is nontrivial to measure\nthe absolute level of telemetry loss in an experimentation system. In this\npaper, we take a top-down approach towards solving this problem. We motivate\nthe impact of loss qualitatively using experiments in real applications\ndeployed at scale, and formalize the problem by presenting a theoretical\nbreakdown of the bias introduced by loss. Based on this foundation, we present\na general framework for quantitatively evaluating the impact of telemetry loss,\nand present two solutions to measure the absolute levels of loss. This\nframework is used by well-known applications at Microsoft, with millions of\nusers and billions of sessions.
