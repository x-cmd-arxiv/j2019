Moreover, we show that when user\nand resource locations are modeled by statistical point processes, and\nresources are allowed to satisfy more than one user, the spatial system under\nunidirectional policies can be mapped into bulk service queuing systems, thus\nallowing the application of a plethora of queuing theory results that yield\nclosed form expressions. As we consider a case where different resources can\nsatisfy different numbers of users, we also generate new results for bulk\nservice queues. We also consider bidirectional policies where there are no\ndirectional restrictions on resource allocation and develop an algorithm for\ncomputing the optimal assignment which is more efficient than known algorithms\nin the literature when there are more resources than users. Finally, numerical\nevaluation of performance of unidirectional and bidirectional allocation\nschemes yields design guidelines beneficial for resource placement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 17:23:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2019 17:04:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 May 2019 00:29:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 23:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-13"}

The goal of this work is to characterise the population of host\ngalaxies of LGRBs at 1 < z < 2, investigate the conditions in which LGRBs form\nat these redshifts and assess their use as tracers of star formation. We\nperform a spectro-photometric analysis to determine the stellar mass, star\nformation rate, specific star formation rate and metallicity of the complete,\nunbiased host galaxy sample of the Swift/BAT6 LGRB sample at 1 < z < 2. We\ncompare the distribution of these properties to the ones of typical\nstar-forming galaxies from the MOSDEF and COSMOS2015 Ultra Deep surveys, within\nthe same redshift range. We find that, similarly to z < 1, LGRBs do not\ndirectly trace star formation at 1 < z < 2, and they tend to avoid high-mass,\nhigh-metallicity host galaxies. We also find evidence for an enhanced fraction\nof starbursts among the LGRB host sample with respect to the star-forming\npopulation of galaxies. Nonetheless we demonstrate that the driving factor\nruling the LGRB efficiency is metallicity. The LGRB host distributions can be\nreconciled with the ones expected from galaxy surveys by imposing a metallicity\nupper limit of 12+logOH ~ 8.55. Metallicity rules the LGRB production\nefficiency, which is stifled at Z > 0.7 Zsun. Under this hypothesis we can\nexpect LGRBs to trace star formation at z > 3, once the bulk of the star\nforming galaxy population are characterised by metallicities below this limit.\nThe moderately high metallicity threshold found is in agreement with the\nconditions necessary to rapidly produce a fast-rotating Wolf-Rayet star a in\nclose binary system, and could be accommodated by single star models under\nchemically homogeneous mixing with very rapid rotation and weak magnetic\ncoupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 13:44:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

The cavity wall shows a strong\ndiscontinuity and we clearly see significant non-azimuthal polarization Uphi\nconsistent with multiple scattering within a disk at an inferred inclination\n~42deg. Radiative transfer modeling along with a new Gaia distance suggest HD\n37400A is a young (~5 Myr) system consisting of two intermediate-mass (~2Msun)\nstars surrounded by a transitional disk and not a solar-mass binary with a\ndebris disk as previously classified.

So far, simulations have\nconcentrated on the optical 7600 \\AA{} A-band of oxygen using synthetic noise\ndistributions. In this paper, we build upon previous work to predict the\ndetectability of molecular oxygen in nearby, temperate planets by using\narchival, time-series data of Proxima Centauri from the high-dispersion UVES\nspectrograph on ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT). The brightest transiting\nM-dwarfs are expected to be about 25 times fainter than Proxima, a factor that\nis similar to the difference in light-gathering power between the VLT and the\nfuture ELTs.

Correcting for the relatively low throughput\n($\\sim$4%) of the Proxima spectra to an assumed 20% throughput for a\nhigh-dispersion spectrograph on the European ELT, we find that the molecular\noxygen signature of an Earth-twin transiting a nearby ($d \\approx 7\n\\,\\mathrm{pc}$) M5V star can be detected in 20-50 transits (a total of 70-175\nhours of observing time).

Appropriate shape\ndescriptors are critical for accurate (and efficient) shape retrieval and 3D\nmodel classification. Several spectral-based shape descriptors have been\nintroduced by solving various physical equations over a 3D surface model. In\nthis paper, for the first time, we incorporate a specific group of techniques\nin statistics and machine learning, known as manifold learning, to develop a\nglobal shape descriptor in the computer graphics domain. The proposed\ndescriptor utilizes the Laplacian Eigenmap technique in which the Laplacian\neigenvalue problem is discretized using an exponential weighting scheme. As a\nresult, our descriptor eliminates the limitations tied to the existing spectral\ndescriptors, namely dependency on triangular mesh representation and high\nintra-class quality of 3D models. We also present a straightforward\nnormalization method to obtain a scale-invariant descriptor. The extensive\nexperiments performed in this study show that the present contribution provides\na highly discriminative and robust shape descriptor under the presence of a\nhigh level of noise, random scale variations, and low sampling rate, in\naddition to the known isometric-invariance property of the Laplace-Beltrami\noperator.

When purely data driven segmentation produces poor\nresults, the final segmentation is generally affected adversely. One challenge\nfaced by many existing data terms is due to the fact that they consider only\npixel intensities to decide whether to assign a pixel to the foreground or to\nthe background region. When the distributions of the foreground and background\npixel intensities have significant overlap, such data terms become ineffective,\nas they produce uncertain results for many pixels in a test image.

In this problem, a gambler sees a finite sequence of\nindependent, non-negative random variables. If he stops the sequence at any\ntime, he collects a reward equal to the most recent observation. The Prophet\nInequality states that, knowing the distribution of each random variable, the\ngambler can achieve at least half as much reward in expectation, as a prophet\nwho knows the entire sample path of random variables (Krengel and Sucheston\n1978). In this paper, we prove a corresponding bound for correlated\nnon-negative random variables. We analyze two methods for proving the bound, a\nconstructive approach, which produces a worst-case instance, and a reductive\napproach, which characterizes a certain submartingale arising from the reward\nprocess of our online algorithm.

Tasks, or supply units, arrive according to another\nstochastic process. Each demand unit must be irrevocably matched to a supply\nunit or rejected. The match earns a reward that depends on the pair. The\nobjective is to maximize the total expected reward over the planning horizon.\nThe problem arises in mobile crowd-sensing and crowd sourcing contexts, where\nworkers and tasks must be matched by a platform according to various criteria.\nWe derive the first online algorithms with worst-case performance guarantees\nfor our class of two-sided bipartite matching problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 23:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-10"}

RAMCP formulates the risk-sensitive\nplanning problem as a two-player zero-sum game, in which an adversary perturbs\nthe agent's belief over the models. We introduce two versions of the RAMCP\nalgorithm. The first, RAMCP-F, converges to an optimal risk-sensitive policy\nwithout having to rebuild the search tree as the underlying belief over models\nis perturbed. The second version, RAMCP-I, improves computational efficiency at\nthe cost of losing theoretical guarantees, but is shown to yield empirical\nresults comparable to RAMCP-F.

From the\nanalysis of the MOND corrected equation of motion of a realistic torsion\npendulum with mixed gravitational and electromagnetic restoring torque simple\nrules for meaningful MOND corrections of measured G values determined by\ndifferent operational modes of Cavendish type G experiments were derived.

The SiO2/Si substrates enable us to\nelectrically tune (Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 and Cr-doped (Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 TI films between\np-type and n-type behavior and thus study the phenomena associated with\ntopological surface states, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE).\nThis work significantly facilitates the fabrication of TI-based devices for\nelectronic and spintronic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 06:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

One appealing\nstrategy to achieve the preferential transport is to passively control the\nsurface wetting gradients, topological or chemical, to break the asymmetric\ncontact line and overcome the resistance force. Despite extensive progress, the\ndirectional droplet transport is limited to small transport velocity and short\ntransport distance due to the fundamental trade-off: rapid transport of droplet\ndemands a large wetting gradient, whereas long-range transport necessitates a\nrelatively small wetting gradient. Here, we report a radically new strategy\nthat resolves the bottleneck through the creation of an unexplored gradient in\nsurface charge density (SCD). By leveraging on a facile droplet printing on\nsuperamphiphobic surfaces as well as the fundamental understanding of the\nmechanisms underpinning the creation of the preferential SCD, we demonstrate\nthe self-propulsion of droplets with a record-high velocity over an ultra-long\ndistance without the need for additional energy input. Such a Leidenfrost-like\ndroplet transport, manifested at ambient condition, is also genetic, which can\noccur on a variety of substrates such as flexible and vertically placed\nsurfaces. Moreover, distinct from conventional physical and chemical gradients,\nthe new dimension of gradient in SCD can be programmed in a rewritable fashion.\nWe envision that our work enriches and extends our capability in the\nmanipulation of droplet transport and would find numerous potential\napplications otherwise impossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 06:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

Recently, a\n\"constructive\" approach to this problem has been developed, and the existence\nof ferromagnetism in the ground states of certain Hubbard models was\nestablished rigorously. A special feature of these Hubbard models is that their\nlowest bands (in the corresponding single-electron problems) are completely\nflat. Here we study models obtained by adding small but arbitrary\ntranslation-invariant perturbation to the hopping Hamiltonian of these\nflat-band models. The resulting models have nearly-flat lowest bands. We prove\nthat the ferromagnetic state is stable against a single-spin flip provided that\nCoulomb interaction U is sufficiently large. (It is easily found that the same\nstate is unstable against a single-spin flip if U is small enough.) We also\nprove upper and lower bounds for the dispersion relation of the lowest energy\neigenstate with a single flipped spin, which bounds establish that the model\nhas \"healthy\" spin-wave excitation. It is notable that the (local) stability of\nferromagnetism is proved in non-singular Hubbard models, in which we must\novercome competition between the kinetic energy and the Coulomb interaction. We\nalso note that this is one of the very few rigorous and robust results which\ndeal with truly nonperturbative phenomena in many electron systems. The local\nstability strongly suggests that the Hubbard models with nearly flat bands have\nferromagnetic ground states.

We focus here on an example of\nthe latter, where the interest is in sea surface temperature (SST), and\nmeasurements are taken from sensors mounted on Elephant Seals in the Southern\nIndian ocean. We show that standard geostatistical models may not be reliable\nfor this type of data, due to the possibility that the regions visited by the\nanimals may depend on the SST. This phenomenon is known in the literature as\npreferential sampling, and, if ignored, it may affect the resulting spatial\npredictions and parameter estimates. Research on this topic has been mostly\nrestricted to stationary sampling locations such as monitoring sites. The main\ncontribution of this manuscript is to extend this methodology to observations\nobtained by devices that move through the region of interest, as is the case\nwith the tagged seals. More specifically, we propose a flexible framework for\ninference on preferentially sampled fields, where the process that generates\nthe sampling locations is stochastic and moving over time through a\n2-dimensional space. Our simulation studies confirm that predictions obtained\nfrom the preferential sampling model are more reliable when this phenomenon is\npresent, and they compare very well to the standard ones when there is no\npreferential sampling. Finally, we note that the conclusions of our analysis of\nthe SST data can change considerably when we incorporate preferential sampling\nin the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 08:15:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-20"}

Such input generators must constantly choose which UI element\nto interact with and how to interact with it, in order to achieve high coverage\nwith a limited time budget. Currently, most input generators adopt\npseudo-random or brute-force searching strategies, which may take very long to\nfind the correct combination of inputs that can drive the app into new and\nimportant states. In this paper, we propose Humanoid, a deep learning-based\napproach to GUI test input generation by learning from human interactions. Our\ninsight is that if we can learn from human-generated interaction traces, it is\npossible to automatically prioritize test inputs based on their importance as\nperceived by users. We design and implement a deep neural network model to\nlearn how end-users would interact with an app (specifically, which UI elements\nto interact with and how). Our experiments showed that the interaction model\ncan successfully prioritize user-preferred inputs for any new UI (with a top-1\naccuracy of 51.2% and a top-10 accuracy of 85.2%).\n  We implemented an input generator for Android apps based on the learned model\nand evaluated it on both open-source apps and market apps. The results\nindicated that Humanoid was able to achieve higher coverage than six\nstate-of-the-art test generators. However, further analysis showed that the\nlearned model was not the main reason of coverage improvement. Although the\nlearned interaction pattern could drive the app into some important GUI states\nwith higher probabilities, it had limited effect on the width and depth of GUI\nstate search, which is the key to improve test coverage in the long term.\nWhether and how human interaction patterns can be used to improve coverage is\nstill an unknown and challenging problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 08:20:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 03:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

Aims: We address the questions whether jets in AGN are\nsymmetric in nature, how well they are collimated on small scales, and how do\nthey evolve with time. Methods: We monitored the sub-parsec scale morphology of\nNGC1052 with the VLBA at 43GHz from 2005 to 2009. Results: A detailed study of\n29 epochs show an asymmetry between both jets. A kinematic analysis of the\noutflows reveals higher apparent velocities for the eastern jet as compared to\nthe western one: beta_ej = 0.529+-0.038 and beta_wj = 0.343+-0.037,\nrespectively. Contradictory to previous studies, we find higher flux densities\nfor the western jet. The distribution of brightness temperature and jet width\nfeatures well collimated jets up to 1mas distance to the dynamic center and a\nnearly conical outflow further outwards. Combining flux density ratios and\nvelocities of the jet flow, we were not able to find a combination of intrinsic\nvelocity and inclination angle of the jets that is consistent for all\nobservations, which is contradictory to symmetrically evolving jets. Spectral\nindex maps between quasi-simultaneous 22GHz and 43GHz observations support the\nexistence of an optically thick absorber covering the innermost 1.6 mas around\nthe 43GHz central feature and an optically thin jet emission with a spectral\nindex of <= -1. Conclusions: Our results fit into a picture in which we expect\nlarger internal energy and/or magnetic flux in the western jet and higher\nkinetic energy in the eastern jet. Previous observations at lower frequencies\nfound slower velocities of the moving jet features as compared to this work.\nConsidering the different velocities at different areas we suggest a\nspine-sheath structure with a faster inner layer and a slower outer layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 08:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

However, real multispectral data suffers from\nthe position shift problem, i.e. the color-thermal image pairs are not strictly\naligned, making one object has different positions in different modalities. In\ndeep learning based methods, this problem makes it difficult to fuse the\nfeature maps from both modalities and puzzles the CNN training. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel Aligned Region CNN (AR-CNN) to handle the weakly aligned\nmultispectral data in an end-to-end way. Firstly, we design a Region Feature\nAlignment (RFA) module to capture the position shift and adaptively align the\nregion features of the two modalities. Secondly, we present a new multimodal\nfusion method, which performs feature re-weighting to select more reliable\nfeatures and suppress the useless ones. Besides, we propose a novel RoI jitter\nstrategy to improve the robustness to unexpected shift patterns of different\ndevices and system settings. Finally, since our method depends on a new kind of\nlabelling: bounding boxes that match each modality, we manually relabel the\nKAIST dataset by locating bounding boxes in both modalities and building their\nrelationships, providing a new KAIST-Paired Annotation.

An\nideal superlattice has a purely antisymmetric voltage current response and can\nthus produce only odd harmonics. However, real world superlattices can also\nhave even harmonic response and that increases the range of possible output\nfrequencies. These effects have been recently explained with a predictive model\nthat combines an Ansatz solution for the Boltzmann Equation with a\nNonequilibrium Green's Functions approach. This predictive tool, coupled with\nrecent progress on GHz input sources, support the growing interest in\ndeveloping compact room temperature devices that can operate from the GHz to\nthe THz range. The natural question to ask is what efficiencies can be\nexpected. This paper addresses this issue by investigating power-conversion\nefficiency in irradiated semiconductor superlattices. Interface imperfections\nare consistently included in the theory and they strongly influence the power\noutput of both odd and even harmonics. Good agreement is obtained for predicted\nodd harmonic outputs with experimental data for a wide frequency range. The\nintrinsic conversion efficiency used is based on the estimated amplitude of the\ninput field inside the sample and thus independent of geometrical factors that\ncharacterize different setups. The method opens the possibility of designing\neven harmonic output power by controlling the interface quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 10:05:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 12:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

In the DSMHN, two sets of modality-specific hash\nfunctions are jointly learned by explicitly preserving both intermodality\nsimilarities and intramodality semantic labels. Specifically, with the\nassumption that the learned hash codes should be optimal for the classification\ntask, two stream networks are jointly trained to learn the hash functions by\nembedding the semantic labels on the resultant hash codes. Moreover, a unified\ndeep multimodal hashing framework is proposed to learn compact and high-quality\nhash codes by exploiting the feature representation learning, intermodality\nsimilarity-preserving learning, semantic label-preserving learning, and hash\nfunction learning with different types of loss functions simultaneously. The\nproposed DSMHN method is a generic and scalable deep hashing framework for both\nimage-text and video-text retrievals, which can be flexibly integrated with\ndifferent types of loss functions.

Time resolved\n(10-20 s) photometry with the SAAO 1.9-m, and 1.0-m telescopes, utilizing the\nSHOC EM-CCD cameras, revealed that the source eclipses, with a period of 2.08\nhours (7482.9$\\pm$3.5$\\,$s). The eclipse light curve has a peculiar morphology,\ncomprising an initial dip, where the source brightness drops to ${\\sim}$50% of\nthe pre-eclipse level before gradually increasing again in brightness. A second\nrapid ingress follows, where the brightness drops by ${\\sim}$60-80%, followed\nby a more gradual decrease to zero flux. We interpret the eclipse profile as\nthe result of an initial obscuration of the accretion hot-spot on the magnetic\nwhite dwarf by the accretion stream, followed by an eclipse of both the\nhot-spot and the partially illuminated stream by the red dwarf donor star. This\nis similar to what has been observed in other eclipsing polars such as HU Aqr,\nbut here the stream absorption is more pronounced.

It is important therefore to critically reflect on the\nchallenges involved in improving information-security behaviours for citizens,\nconsumers and employees.

Changing\nbehaviour requires more than providing information about risks and reactive\nbehaviours - firstly, people must be able to understand and apply the advice,\nand secondly, they must be motivated and willing to do so - and the latter\nrequires changes to attitudes and intentions. These antecedents of behaviour\nchange are identified in several psychological models of behaviour. We review\nthe suitability of persuasion techniques, including the widely used 'fear\nappeals'. From this range of literature, we extract essential components for an\nawareness campaign as well as factors which can lead to a campaign's success or\nfailure.

For a better understanding\nof wave heating, we need to take into account the effects of different\ndissipation coefficients such as resistivity and viscosity, the importance of\nthe loop physical characteristics, and the ways gravity can factor into the\nevolution of these phenomena. We aim to map the sites of energy dissipation\nfrom transverse waves in coronal loops in the presence and absence of\ngravitational stratification and to compare ideal, resistive, and viscous MHD.\nUsing the PLUTO code, we performed 3D MHD simulations of kink waves in single,\nstraight, density-enhanced coronal flux tubes of multiple temperatures. We see\nthe creation of spatially expanded Kelvin-Helmholtz eddies along the loop,\nwhich deform the initial monolithic loop profile. For the case of driven\noscillations, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability develops despite physical\ndissipation, unless very high values of shear viscosity are used. Energy\ndissipation gets its highest values near the apex, but is present all along the\nloop. We observe an increased efficiency of wave heating once the kinetic\nenergy saturates at the later stages of the simulation and a turbulent density\nprofile has developed. The inclusion of gravity greatly alters the dynamic\nevolution of our systems and should not be ignored in future studies. Stronger\nphysical dissipation leads to stronger wave heating in our set-ups. Finally,\nonce the kinetic energy of the oscillating loop starts saturating, all the\nexcess input energy turns into internal energy, resulting in more efficient\nwave heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 11:09:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 08:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

From this perspective, we report on the key role played by the Sb/Ga\nflux ratio in controlling the structural quality and incorporation of high Bi\ncontent (up to 14.5 %-Bi), revealing three distinct epitaxial phases. The first\nphase (below stoichiometric Sb/Ga) exhibits Ga-Bi compound droplets, low\ncrystal quality, and reduced Bi content. At the second phase (above\nstoichiometric Sb/Ga), the crystal exhibits smooth surfaces and excellent\ncrystallinity with efficient Bi incorporation. The last phase corresponds to\nexceeding a Sb/Ga threshold that leads to reduced Bi incorporation, Bi droplets\nand degraded crystallinity. This threshold value that defines the optimal\ngrowth window is controlled by the temperature as well as the Bi/Ga ratio.\nIncreasing temperature increases the threshold, albeit simultaneously reducing\nBi incorporation. Conversely, increasing the Bi/Ga flux ratio increases Bi\nincorporation, while narrowing down and ultimately closing the window.

We use\nthe Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to search for a total\nof four CH$_3$OH emission lines in bands 6 and 7 toward the disk around the\nyoung Herbig Ae star HD 163296. The disk-averaged column density of methanol\nand its related species formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) are estimated assuming optically\nthin emission in local thermodynamic equilibrium.

For these applications, the\nbattery should perform reliably and pose no safety threats. However, the\nperformance of Li-ion batteries can be affected by abnormal thermal behaviors,\ndefined as faults. It is essential to develop reliable thermal management\nsystem to accurately predict and monitor thermal behaviors of Li-ion battery.\nUsing the first-principle models of batteries, this work presents a stochastic\nfault detection and diagnosis (FDD) algorithm to identify two particular faults\nin the Li-ion battery cells, using easily measured quantities such as\ntemperatures. Models of Li-ion battery are typically derived from the\nunderlying physical phenomena. To make model tractable and useful, it is common\nto make simplifications during model development, which may consequently\nintroduce mismatch between models and battery cells. Further, FDD algorithms\ncan be affected by uncertainty, which may originate from either intrinsic time\nvarying phenomena or model calibration with noisy data. A two-step FDD\nalgorithm is developed in this work to correct model of Li-ion battery cells\nand to identify faulty operations from a normal operating condition. An\niterative optimization problem is proposed to correct the model by\nincorporating the errors between measured quantities and model predictions,\nwhich is followed by an optimization-based FDD to provide a probabilistic\ndescription of the occurrence of possible faults, while taking the uncertainty\ninto account. The two-step stochastic FDD algorithm in this work is shown to be\nefficient in terms of fault detection rate for both individual and simultaneous\nfaults in Li-ion batteries, as compared to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 12:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-10"}

Post analysis of wear track by FESEM, AFM based\nnanoscale friction and Raman spectroscopy reveal that microcrystalline diamond\nundergoes shear induced amorphization with negligible wear rate while\nnanocrystalline diamond films undergo shear induced plastic deformation without\namorphization. A comprehensive mechanism for the observed CoF is discussed in\nthe framework of microstructure, structural disorder and shear induced\ntribo-chemical reactions at the sliding interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 12:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-10"}

Modelling them can\nbe challenging due to various business and network aspects. Existing models of\nwireless markets are either microscopic, focusing on a specific technical\naspect (e.g., network topology) at a fine scale or macroscopic modelling\nwireless markets at a large-scale, e.g., considering homogeneous populations.\nIn contrast to these approaches, this work develops a multi-layer\ngame-theoretical framework, which allows providers to model users at\nmultiple-level of detail by considering a different number of user\nsub-populations. It also models the mobility, traffic demand, and networks of\nproviders. A population game using Logit dynamics models the user selection of\nthe dataplan and provider, capturing the diversity in customer profile and\nrelaxing the assumption about the user rationality. It analytically computes\nthe equilibriums of users and providers and numerically evaluates the\nperformance of the market as a function of the traffic demand, the number of\navailable dataplans, and the knowledge about customer population. Significant\nbenefits in revenue can be achieved by a provider when it integrates more\ndetailed information about the user population. The number of disconnected\nusers also decreases. Moreover the availability of several dataplans further\nenhances the gains. The stronger the provider, the more prominent the benefits.\nHowever the benefits diminish when all the providers model the customer\npopulation at the same degree of detail due to an increased competition. The\nanalysis highlights the strategies of the providers depending on their\ncapacity, level of knowledge about the customer population, and traffic\nconditions. It illustrates how a provider changes its strategy under different\nconditions, focusing potentially on different customer segments and also the\npressure introduced by specific customer types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 12:48:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-10"}

A core issue in transfer learning is to learn a shared feature\nspace in where the distributions of the data from two domains are matched. This\nlearning process can be named as transfer representation learning (TRL). The\nfeature transformation methods are crucial to ensure the success of TRL. The\nmost commonly used feature transformation method in TRL is kernel-based\nnonlinear mapping to the high-dimensional space followed by linear\ndimensionality reduction. But the kernel functions are lack of interpretability\nand are difficult to be selected. To this end, the TSK fuzzy system (TSK-FS) is\ncombined with transfer learning and a more intuitive and interpretable modeling\nmethod, called transfer representation learning with TSK-FS (TRL-TSK-FS) is\nproposed in this paper. Specifically, TRL-TSK-FS realizes TRL from two aspects.\nOn one hand, the data in the source and target domains are transformed into the\nfuzzy feature space in which the distribution distance of the data between two\ndomains is min-imized. On the other hand, discriminant information and\ngeo-metric properties of the data are preserved by linear discriminant analysis\nand principal component analysis. In addition, another advantage arises with\nthe proposed method, that is, the nonlinear transformation is realized by\nconstructing fuzzy mapping with the antecedent part of the TSK-FS instead of\nkernel functions which are difficult to be selected. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on the text and image datasets. The results obviously show the\nsuperiority of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 12:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-10"}

We performed high-angular-resolution (beam\nFWHM ~0.15\") 1.2-mm continuum and line observations towards G16.59$-$0.05 with\nthe Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The main dust clump, with size\n~10$^4$ au, is resolved into four relatively compact (diameter ~2000 au)\nmillimeter (mm) sources. The source harboring the high-mass YSO is the most\nprominent in molecular emission. By fitting the emission profiles of several\nunblended and optically thin transitions of CH$_3$OCH$_3$ and CH$_3$OH, we\nderived gas temperatures inside the mm-sources in the range 42--131 K, and\ncalculated masses of 1--5 $M_{\\odot}$. A well-defined Local Standard of Rest\nvelocity (Vlsr) gradient is detected in most of the high-density molecular\ntracers at the position of the high-mass YSO, pinpointed by compact 22-GHz\nfree-free emission. This gradient is oriented along a direction forming a large\n(~70 degree) angle with the radio jet, traced by elongated 13-GHz continuum\nemission. The butterfly-like shapes of the P-V plots and the linear pattern of\nthe emission peaks of the molecular lines at high velocity confirm that this\nVlsr gradient is due to rotation of the gas in the disk surrounding the\nhigh-mass YSO. The disk radius is ~500 au, and the Vlsr distribution along the\nmajor axis of the disk is well reproduced by a Keplerian profile around a\ncentral mass of 10$\\pm$2 $M_{\\odot}$. The position of the YSO is offset by >~\n0.1\" from the axis of the radio jet and the dust emission peak. To explain this\ndisplacement we argue that the high-mass YSO could have moved from the center\nof the parental mm source owing to dynamical interaction with one or more\ncompanions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 13:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Of these, where can we find the most compact\nrepresentation? We propose to use a pruning framework to answer this question:\nHow compact can each layer be compressed, without losing performance? Most of\nthe existing DNN compression methods do not consider the relative\ncompressibility of the individual layers. They uniformly apply a single target\nsparsity to all layers or adapt layer sparsity using heuristics and additional\ntraining. We propose a principled method that automatically determines the\nsparsity of individual layers derived from the importance of each layer. To do\nthis, we consider a metric to measure the importance of each layer based on the\nlayer-wise capacity. Given the trained model and the total target sparsity, we\nfirst evaluate the importance of each layer from the model. From the evaluated\nimportance, we compute the layer-wise sparsity of each layer. The proposed\nmethod can be applied to any DNN architecture and can be combined with any\npruning method that takes the total target sparsity as a parameter. To validate\nthe proposed method, we carried out an image classification task with two types\nof DNN architectures on two benchmark datasets and used three pruning methods\nfor compression. In case of VGG-16 model with weight pruning on the ImageNet\ndataset, we achieved up to 75% (17.5% on average) better top-5 accuracy than\nthe baseline under the same total target sparsity. Furthermore, we analyzed\nwhere the maximum compression can occur in the network.

Contrary to CP, matter effects in uniform matter cannot induce by\nthemselves a non-vanishing T asymmetry; however, the question of the title\nremained open.

In essence, coordination can\nbe achieved by combining stigmergic and flocking behaviors. Stigmergy occurs\nwhen a drone releases digital pheromone upon sensing of a potential target.\nSuch pheromones can be aggregated and diffused between flocking drones,\ncreating a spatiotemporal attractive potential field. Flocking occurs, as an\nemergent effect of alignment, separation and cohesion, where drones self\norganise with similar heading and dynamic arrangement as a group. The emergent\ncoordination of drones relies on the alignment of stigmergy and flocking\nstrategies.

Currently,\nanalysts typically rely on a combination of indices, such as resilience,\nrobustness, redundancy, security, and vulnerability. However, these indices are\nnot by themselves sufficient as a guide to action; for example, while it is\npossible to develop policies to decrease vulnerability, such policies may not\nalways be cost-effective. Motivated by this gap, we propose a new index,\ndefensibility. A system is considered defensible to the extent that a modest\ninvestment can significantly reduce the damage from an attack or disruption. To\ncompare systems whose performance is not readily commensurable (e.g., the\nelectrical grid vs. the water-distribution network, both of which are critical,\nbut which provide distinct types of services), we defined defensibility as a\ndimensionless index. After defining defensibility quantitatively, we illustrate\nhow the defensibility of a system depends on factors such as the defender and\nattacker asset valuations, the nature of the threat (whether intelligent and\nadaptive, or random), and the levels of attack and defense strengths and\nprovide analytical results that support the observations arising from the above\nillustrations. Overall, we argue that the defensibility of a system is an\nimportant dimension to consider when evaluating potential defensive\ninvestments, and that it can be applied in a variety of different contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 01:27:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

Gray-box models offer a causal inference\nof those dynamics expressed in few parameters specific to built environments.\nThese parameters can provide compelling insights into the characteristics of\nbuilding artifacts and have various applications such as forecasting HVAC\nusage, indoor temperature control monitoring of built environments, etc. In\nthis paper, we present a systematic study of modeling buildings' thermal\ncharacteristics and thus derive the parameters of built conditions with a\nBayesian approach. We build a Bayesian state-space model that can adapt and\nincorporate buildings' thermal equations and propose a generalized solution\nthat can easily adapt prior knowledge regarding the parameters. We show that a\nfaster approximate approach using variational inference for parameter\nestimation can provide similar parameters as that of a more time-consuming\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We perform extensive evaluations on\ntwo datasets to understand the generative process and show that the Bayesian\napproach is more interpretable. We further study the effects of prior selection\nfor the model parameters and transfer learning, where we learn parameters from\none season and use them to fit the model in the other.

For single community detection, this paper demonstrates the\nsuitability of EXIT to predict the asymptotic phase transition for weak\nrecovery. More importantly, EXIT analysis is leveraged to produce useful\ninsights such as the performance of belief propagation near the threshold. For\ntwo symmetric communities, the asymptotic residual error for belief propagation\nis calculated under finite-alphabet side information, generalizing a previous\nresult with noisy labels.

In\nthis paper, we formulate this challenge as the prize-collecting Steiner Tree\nProblem (PCSTP). The objective is to minimize the costs of transmission routes\nand the disconnected monetary or informational profits. Initially, we note that\nthe PCSTP is MAX SNP-hard. Then, we propose some post-processing techniques to\nimprove suboptimal solutions to PCSTP. Based on these techniques, we propose\ntwo fast heuristic algorithms: the first one is a quasilinear time heuristic\nalgorithm that is faster and consumes less memory than other algorithms; and\nthe second one is an improvement of a stateof-the-art polynomial time heuristic\nalgorithm that can find high-quality solutions at a speed that is only inferior\nto the first one. We demonstrate the competitiveness of our heuristic\nalgorithms by comparing them with the state-of-the-art ones on the largest\nexisting benchmark instances (169 800 vertices and 338 551 edges). Moreover, we\ngenerate new instances that are even larger (1 000 000 vertices and 10 000 000\nedges) to further demonstrate their advantages in large networks. The\nstate-ofthe-art algorithms are too slow to find high-quality solutions for\ninstances of this size, whereas our new heuristic algorithms can do this in\naround 6 to 45s on a personal computer. Ultimately, we apply our\npost-processing techniques to update the bestknown solution for a notoriously\ndifficult benchmark instance to show that they can improve near-optimal\nsolutions to PCSTP. In conclusion, we demonstrate the usefulness of our\nheuristic algorithms and post-processing techniques for designing large and\nlow-cost communication networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 01:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-07"}

Two different phases in the evolution of the\nbubbles can be distinguished. In the first phase, which occurs after a delay\ntime {\\tau}d of about 100 {\\mu}s, an explosive microbubble, reaching a diameter\nin the range from 10 {\\mu}m to 100 {\\mu}m, is formed. The exact size of this\nexplosive microbubble barely depends on the carbon chain length of the alkane,\nbut only on the laser power $P_l$. With increasing laser power, the delay time\nprior to bubble nucleation as well as the size of the microbubble both\ndecrease. In the second phase, which sets in right after the collapse of the\nexplosive microbubble, a new bubble forms and starts growing due to the\nvaporization of the surrounding liquid, which is highly gas rich. The final\nbubble size in this second phase strongly depends on the alkane chain length,\nnamely it increases with decreasing number of carbon atoms.
