We study the solution in two\ndifferent kinematic limits corresponding to small and large momentum $p_n$,\nperpendicular to the boundary.

Using this we derive some consistency conditions regarding the\ndependence of these anomalies on the boundary conditions and discuss possible\ncancellation mechanisms.

In this vein, the\nIntrusion detection systems (IDS) have emerged as a viable solution for the\ndetection and prevention of malicious activities. Unlike the signature-based\ndetection approaches, machine learning-based solutions are a promising means\nfor detecting unknown attacks. However, the machine learning models need to be\naccurate enough to reduce the number of false alarms. More importantly, they\nneed to be trained and evaluated on realistic datasets such that their efficacy\ncan be validated on real-time deployments. Many solutions proposed in the\nliterature are reported to have high accuracy but are ineffective in real\napplications due to the non-representativity of the dataset used for training\nand evaluation of the underlying models. On the other hand, some of the\nexisting solutions overcome these challenges but yield low accuracy which\nhampers their implementation for commercial tools. These solutions are majorly\nbased on single learners and are therefore directly affected by the intrinsic\nlimitations of each learning algorithm. The novelty of this paper is to use the\nmost realistic dataset available for intrusion detection called NSL-KDD, and\ncombine multiple learners to build ensemble learners that increase the accuracy\nof the detection. Furthermore, a deployment architecture in a fog-to-things\nenvironment that employs two levels of classifications is proposed. In such\narchitecture, the first level performs an anomaly detection which reduces the\nlatency of the classification substantially, while the second level, executes\nattack classifications, enabling precise prevention measures. Finally, the\nexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IDS in\ncomparison with the other state-of-the-arts on the NSL-KDD dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 16:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}

This paper presents techniques for managing and designing\na multi-tier storage hierarchy comprising of DRAM, NVM, and SSD. Our main\ntechnical contributions are a multi-tier buffer manager and a storage system\ndesigner that leverage the characteristics of NVM. We propose a set of\noptimizations for maximizing the utility of data migration between different\ndevices in the storage hierarchy. We demonstrate that these optimizations have\nto be tailored based on device and workload characteristics. Given this, we\npresent a technique for adapting these optimizations to achieve a near-optimal\nbuffer management policy for an arbitrary workload and storage hierarchy\nwithout requiring any manual tuning. We finally present a recommendation system\nfor designing a multi-tier storage hierarchy for a target workload and system\ncost budget. Our results show that the NVM-aware buffer manager and storage\nsystem designer improve throughput and reduce system cost across different\ntransaction and analytical processing workloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 16:38:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-31"}

In this paper we extend the SFs & GPI framework in two\nways. One of the basic assumptions underlying the original formulation of SFs &\nGPI is that rewards for all tasks of interest can be computed as linear\ncombinations of a fixed set of features. We relax this constraint and show that\nthe theoretical guarantees supporting the framework can be extended to any set\nof tasks that only differ in the reward function. Our second contribution is to\nshow that one can use the reward functions themselves as features for future\ntasks, without any loss of expressiveness, thus removing the need to specify a\nset of features beforehand. This makes it possible to combine SFs & GPI with\ndeep learning in a more stable way. We empirically verify this claim on a\ncomplex 3D environment where observations are images from a first-person\nperspective. We show that the transfer promoted by SFs & GPI leads to very good\npolicies on unseen tasks almost instantaneously. We also describe how to learn\npolicies specialised to the new tasks in a way that allows them to be added to\nthe agent's set of skills, and thus be reused in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 17:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-31"}

A robot with the ability to\nbuild and adapt this interpretation process according to its own tasks and\ncapabilities would push away the limits of what robots can achieve in a non\ncontrolled environment. A solution is to provide the robot with processes to\nbuild such representations that are not specific to an environment or a\nsituation. A lot of works focus on objects segmentation, recognition and\nmanipulation. Defining an object solely on the basis of its visual appearance\nis challenging given the wide range of possible objects and environments.\nTherefore, current works make simplifying assumptions about the structure of a\nscene. Such assumptions reduce the adaptivity of the object extraction process\nto the environments in which the assumption holds. To limit such assumptions,\nwe introduce an exploration method aimed at identifying moveable elements in a\nscene without considering the concept of object. By using the interactive\nperception framework, we aim at bootstrapping the acquisition process of a\nrepresentation of the environment with a minimum of context specific\nassumptions. The robotic system builds a perceptual map called relevance map\nwhich indicates the moveable parts of the current scene. A classifier is\ntrained online to predict the category of each region (moveable or\nnon-moveable). It is also used to select a region with which to interact, with\nthe goal of minimizing the uncertainty of the classification.

Their eruption is commonly preceded by a\nslow increase in height that can last from hours to days. This increase in the\nprominence height is believed to be due to their host magnetic flux rope\ntransitioning through a series of neighbouring quasi-equilibria before the main\nloss-of-equilibrium that drives the eruption. Recent work suggests that the\nremoval of prominence mass from a stable, quiescent flux rope is one possible\ncause for this change in height. However, these conclusions are drawn from\nobservations and are subject to interpretation. Here we present a simple model\nto quantify the effect of \"mass-draining\" during the pre-eruptive\nheight-evolution of a solar flux rope. The flux rope is modeled as a line\ncurrent suspended within a background potential magnetic field. We first show\nthat the inclusion of mass, up to $10^{12}$~kg, can modify the height at which\nthe line current experiences loss-of-equilibrium by up to 14\\%. Next, we show\nthat the rapid removal of mass prior to the loss-of-equilibrium can allow the\nheight of the flux rope to increase sharply and without upper bound as it\napproaches its loss-of-equilibrium point. This indicates that the critical\nheight for the loss-of-equilibrium can occur at a range of heights depending\nexplicitly on the amount and evolution of mass within the flux rope. Finally,\nwe demonstrate that for the same amount of drained mass, the effect on the\nheight of the flux rope is up to two order of magnitude larger for quiescent\nthan for active region prominences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 17:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

To address this shortfall, we introduce a new\nalgorithm called Go-Explore.

On Montezuma's\nRevenge, Go-Explore scores a mean of over 43k points, almost 4 times the\nprevious state of the art. Go-Explore can also harness human-provided domain\nknowledge and, when augmented with it, scores a mean of over 650k points on\nMontezuma's Revenge.

On Pitfall, Go-Explore with domain knowledge is the first\nalgorithm to score above zero. Its mean score of almost 60k points exceeds\nexpert human performance. Because Go-Explore produces high-performing\ndemonstrations automatically and cheaply, it also outperforms imitation\nlearning work where humans provide solution demonstrations.

However, current compression strategies are mostly\nhardware-agnostic and network complexity reduction does not always translate\ninto execution efficiency. In this work, we propose a hardware-guided symbiotic\ntraining methodology for compact, accurate, yet execution-efficient inference\nmodels. It is based on our observation that hardware may introduce substantial\nnon-monotonic behavior, which we call the latency hysteresis effect, when\nevaluating network size vs. inference latency. This observation raises question\nabout the mainstream smaller-dimension-is-better compression strategy, which\noften leads to a sub-optimal model architecture. By leveraging the\nhardware-impacted hysteresis effect and sparsity, we are able to achieve the\nsymbiosis of model compactness and accuracy with execution efficiency, thus\nreducing LSTM latency while increasing its accuracy. We have evaluated our\nalgorithms on language modeling and speech recognition applications. Relative\nto the traditional stacked LSTM architecture obtained for the Penn Treebank\ndataset, we reduce the number of parameters by 18.0x (30.5x) and measured\nrun-time latency by up to 2.4x (5.2x) on Nvidia GPUs (Intel Xeon CPUs) without\nany accuracy degradation.

Capturing correlation within the\napproximation requires an explicit parametrization. This intrinsically limits\nthis approach to either moderately dimensional problems, or requiring the\nstrongly simplifying mean-field approach. We propose Metric Gaussian\nVariational Inference (MGVI) as a method that goes beyond mean-field. Here\ncorrelations between all model parameters are taken into account, while still\nscaling linearly in computational time and memory. With this method we achieve\nhigher accuracy and in many cases a significant speedup compared to traditional\nmethods. MGVI is an iterative method that performs a series of Gaussian\napproximations to the posterior. We alternate between approximating the\ncovariance with the inverse Fisher information metric evaluated at an\nintermediate mean estimate and optimizing the KL-divergence for the given\ncovariance with respect to the mean. This procedure is iterated until the\nuncertainty estimate is self-consistent with the mean parameter. We achieve\nlinear scaling by avoiding to store the covariance explicitly at any time.\nInstead we draw samples from the approximating distribution relying on an\nimplicit representation and numerical schemes to approximately solve linear\nequations. Those samples are used to approximate the KL-divergence and its\ngradient. The usage of natural gradient descent allows for rapid convergence.\nFormulating the Bayesian model in standardized coordinates makes MGVI\napplicable to any inference problem with continuous parameters. We demonstrate\nthe high accuracy of MGVI by comparing it to HMC and its fast convergence\nrelative to other established methods in several examples.

The\nsizes of the islands have long been recognized as reflecting the\nlow-temperature cooling rates of meteorite parent bodies. However, a model\ncapable of providing quantitative cooling rate estimates from island sizes has\nbeen lacking. Moreover, these islands are also capable of preserving a record\nof the ambient magnetic field as they grew, but some of the key physical\nparameters required for recovering reliable paleointensity estimates from\nmagnetic measurements of these islands have been poorly constrained. To address\nboth of these issues, we present a numerical model of the structural and\ncompositional evolution of the cloudy zone as a function of cooling rate and\nlocal composition. Our model produces island sizes that are consistent with\npresent-day measured sizes. This model enables a substantial improvement in the\ncalibration of paleointensity estimates and associated uncertainties. In\nparticular, we can now accurately quantify the statistical uncertainty\nassociated with the finite number of islands and the uncertainty on their size\nat the time of the record. We use this new understanding to revisit\npaleointensities from previous pioneering paleomagnetic studies of cloudy\nzones.

Nevertheless, under the\ncurrent networking strategy that promotes aggressive densification, it is\nunclear whether cache-enabled HetNets preserve the claimed cost-effectiveness\nand the potential benefits. This is due to 1) the collective cost of caching\nwhich may inevitably exceed the expensive cost of backhaul in a dense HetNet,\nand 2) the excessive interference which affects the signal reception\nirrespective of content placement. We analyze these significant, yet\noverlooked, issues, showing that while densification reduces backhaul load and\nincreases spectral efficiency in cache-enabled dense networks, it\nsimultaneously reduces cache-hit probability and increases the network cost. We\nthen introduce a caching efficiency metric, area spectral efficiency per unit\nspent cost, and find it enough to cache only about 3% of the content library\nsize in the cache of smallcell base stations. Furthermore, we show that range\nexpansion, which is known to be of substantial value in wireless networks, is\nalmost impotent to curb the caching inefficiency.

IceCube\nbegan releasing alerts for single high-energy ($E > 60$ TeV) neutrino\ndetections with sky localisation regions of order 1 deg radius in 2016. We used\nPan-STARRS1 to follow-up five of these alerts during 2016-2017 to search for\nany optical transients that may be related to the neutrinos. Typically 10-20\nfaint ($m < 22.5$ mag) extragalactic transients are found within the\nPan-STARRS1 footprints and are generally consistent with being unrelated field\nsupernovae (SNe) and AGN. We looked for unusual properties of the detected\ntransients, such as temporal coincidence of explosion epoch with the IceCube\ntimestamp. We found only one transient that had properties worthy of a specific\nfollow-up. In the Pan-STARRS1 imaging for IceCube-160427A (probability to be of\nastrophysical origin of $\\sim$50 %), we found a SN PS16cgx, located at 10.0'\nfrom the nominal IceCube direction. Spectroscopic observations of PS16cgx\nshowed that it was an H-poor SN at z = 0.2895. The spectra and light curve\nresemble some high-energy Type Ic SNe, raising the possibility of a jet driven\nSN with an explosion epoch temporally coincident with the neutrino detection.\nHowever, distinguishing Type Ia and Type Ic SNe at this redshift is notoriously\ndifficult. Based on all available data we conclude that the transient is more\nlikely to be a Type Ia with relatively weak SiII absorption and a fairly normal\nrest-frame r-band light curve. If, as predicted, there is no high-energy\nneutrino emission from Type Ia SNe, then PS16cgx must be a random coincidence,\nand unrelated to the IceCube-160427A.

Counterintuitively, it is shown that when such an emitter stands above\na uniaxial dielectric half-space with tilted optical axes it may experience a\nrecoil force oriented along the direction perpendicular to the plane defined by\nthe interface normal and the substrate optical axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 20:35:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

In simulations, these flows of\ncold gas readily form by interactions of the cluster core with small\nsubclusters, due to a separation of the cold gas from the dark matter (DM), due\nto their markedly different collisionalities. In this work, we use numerical\nsimulations to investigate the effects of increasing the DM collisionality on\nsloshing cold fronts in a cool-core cluster. For clusters in isolation, the\nformation of a flat DM core via self-interactions results in modest adiabatic\nexpansion and cooling of the core gas. In merger simulations, cold fronts form\nin the same manner as in previous simulations, but the flattened potential in\nthe core region enables the gas to expand to larger radii in the initial\nstages. Upon infall, the subcluster's DM mass decreases via collisions,\nreducing its influence on the core. Thus, the sloshing gas moves slower,\ninhibiting the growth of fluid instabilities relative to simulations where the\nDM cross section is zero. This also inhibits turbulent mixing and the increase\nin entropy that would otherwise result. For values of the cross section\n$\\sigma/m > 1$, subclusters do not survive as self-gravitating structures for\nmore than two core passages. Additionally, separations between the peaks in the\nX-ray emissivity and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect signals during sloshing\nmay place constraints on DM self-interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 23:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

The source of these pessimistic bounds is a model\nthat permits arbitrary, possibly adversarial analysts that optimally use\ninformation to bias results. While being a central issue in the field, still\nlacking are notions of natural analysts that allow for more optimistic bounds\nfaithful to the reality that typical analysts aren't adversarial.\n  In this work, we propose notions of natural analysts that smoothly\ninterpolate between the optimal non-adaptive bounds and the best-known adaptive\ngeneralization bounds. To accomplish this, we model the analyst's knowledge as\nevolving according to the rules of an unknown dynamical system that takes in\nrevealed information and outputs new statistical queries to the data. This\nallows us to restrict the analyst through different natural control-theoretic\nnotions. One such notion corresponds to a recency bias, formalizing an\ninability to arbitrarily use distant information. Another complementary notion\nformalizes an anchoring bias, a tendency to weight initial information more\nstrongly. Both notions come with quantitative parameters that smoothly\ninterpolate between the non-adaptive case and the fully adaptive case, allowing\nfor a rich spectrum of intermediate analysts that are neither non-adaptive nor\nadversarial.\n  Natural not only from a cognitive perspective, we show that our notions also\ncapture standard optimization methods, like gradient descent in various\nsettings.

Several mainstream works (e.g., 3D-R2N2) use recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs) to fuse multiple feature maps extracted from input images\nsequentially. However, when given the same set of input images with different\norders, RNN-based approaches are unable to produce consistent reconstruction\nresults. Moreover, due to long-term memory loss, RNNs cannot fully exploit\ninput images to refine reconstruction results. To solve these problems, we\npropose a novel framework for single-view and multi-view 3D reconstruction,\nnamed Pix2Vox. By using a well-designed encoder-decoder, it generates a coarse\n3D volume from each input image. Then, a context-aware fusion module is\nintroduced to adaptively select high-quality reconstructions for each part\n(e.g., table legs) from different coarse 3D volumes to obtain a fused 3D\nvolume. Finally, a refiner further refines the fused 3D volume to generate the\nfinal output. Experimental results on the ShapeNet and Pix3D benchmarks\nindicate that the proposed Pix2Vox outperforms state-of-the-arts by a large\nmargin. Furthermore, the proposed method is 24 times faster than 3D-R2N2 in\nterms of backward inference time.

One of the distinctive features of\nphase-valued networks is the existence of multiple operating conditions\ncorresponding to critical points of an energy function or feasible flows of a\nbalance equation. For networks with phase-valued states, it is not yet fully\nunderstood how many operating conditions exist, how to characterize them, and\nhow to compute them efficiently. A deeper understanding of feasible operating\nconditions, including their dependence upon network structures, may lead to\nmore reliable and efficient network systems.\n  This paper introduces flow and elastic network problems on the $n$-torus and\nprovides a rigorous and comprehensive framework for their study. Based on a\nmonotonicity assumption, this framework localizes the solutions, bounds their\nnumber, and leads to an algorithm to compute them. Our analysis is based on a\nnovel winding partition of the $n$-torus into winding cells, induced by\nKirchhoff's angle law for undirected graphs. The winding partition has several\nuseful properties, including notably that, each winding cell contains at most\none solution. The proposed algorithm is based on a novel contraction mapping\nand is guaranteed to compute all solutions.

The radial variations in SFE for\nindividual galaxies are typically a factor of 2 -- 3, which suggests that SFE\nis nearly constant along galactocentric radius. We found the averaged SFE in 80\ngalaxies of $(1.69 \\pm 1.1) \\times 10^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$, which is consistent with\nLeroy et al. 2008 if we consider the contribution of helium to the molecular\ngas mass evaluation and the difference in the assumed initial mass function\nbetween two studies. We compared SFE among different morphological (i.e., SA,\nSAB, and SB) types, and found that SFE within the inner radii ($r/r_{25} <\n0.3$, where $r_{25}$ is $B$-band isophotal radius at 25 mag arcsec$^{-2}$) of\nSB galaxies is slightly higher than that of SA and SAB galaxies.

The theory also predicts the\nexistence of isoscalar tetraquarks which are bound states of diquarks and\nanti-diquarks. The candidates for these exotic isoscalar tetraquarks are\nidentified. In particular, the $f_0(1500)$ is identified as isoscalar\ntetraquark; the predicted mass value 1.52 GeV agrees with the measured\nexperimental value within the model uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 04:10:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 08:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

Surprisingly, the condensate was experimentally\ncharacterized by a soft plasmon mode that only exists near the transition\ntemperature, $T_c$, of the charge density wave (CDW). Here, we characterize and\nanalyze the experimental spectra using linear-response time-dependent density\nfunctional theory and find that the soft mode can be attributed to interband\nelectronic transitions. At the CDW state below $T_c$, the periodic lattice\ndistortions hamper the spontaneous formation of the exciton by introducing a\nCDW gap. The band gap raises the soft mode and merges it into the regular\nplasmon. Our surprising results contradict previous simplistic analytical\nmodels commonly used in the scientific literature. In addition, we find that a\nfinite electronic temperature, $T_e$, introduces a dissipation channel and\nprevents the condensation above $T_c$.

First, the respective system\nof coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs) is reduced to a system of\nequations for envelopes of the lattice wave functions. Two generic dynamical\nregimes are revealed by simulations of the reduced system, viz., shuttle\noscillations of pairs of solitons with positive and negative masses, and\nsplitting of the pair.

Although the state of a system may evolve\nduring time, a non-negligible transition cost is incured for transitioning from\none state to another. In order to model such situations, Gupta et al. (ICALP\n2014) and Eisenstat et al. (ICALP 2014) introduced a multistage model where the\ninput is a sequence of instances (one for each time step), and the goal is to\nfind a sequence of solutions (one for each time step) that are both (i) near\noptimal for each time step and (ii) as stable as possible. We focus on the\nmultistage version of the Knapsack problem where we are given a time horizon\nt=1,2,...,T, and a sequence of knapsack instances I_1,I_2,...,I_T, one for each\ntime step, defined on a set of n objects. In every time step t we have to\nchoose a feasible knapsack S_t of I_t, which gives a knapsack profit. To\nmeasure the stability/similarity of two consecutive solutions S_t and S_{t+1},\nwe identify the objects for which the decision, to be picked or not, remains\nthe same in S_t and S_{t+1}, giving a transition profit.

Count sketch is a simple\npopular sketch which uses a randomized hash function to achieve compression. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel extension known as Higher-order Count Sketch\n(HCS). While count sketch uses a single hash function, HCS uses multiple\n(smaller) hash functions for sketching. HCS reshapes the input (vector) data\ninto a higher-order tensor and employs a tensor product of the random hash\nfunctions to compute the sketch. This results in an exponential saving (with\nrespect to the order of the tensor) in the memory requirements of the hash\nfunctions, under certain conditions on the input data. Furthermore, when the\ninput data itself has an underlying structure in the form of various tensor\nrepresentations such as the Tucker decomposition, we obtain significant\nadvantages. We derive efficient (approximate) computation of various tensor\noperations such as tensor products and tensor contractions directly on the\nsketched data. Thus, HCS is the first sketch to fully exploit the\nmulti-dimensional nature of higher-order tensors.

This complexity often manifests itself as lower\ndimensional manifolds on which the likelihood function is invariant, or varies\nvery little. This can be due to trying to infer unobservable parameters, or due\nto sloppiness in the model which is being used to describe the data. In such a\nsituation, standard sampling methods for characterising the posterior\ndistribution, which do not incorporate information about this structure, will\nbe highly inefficient.\n  In this paper, we seek to develop an approach to tackle this problem when\nusing adaptive importance sampling methods, by using optimal transport maps to\nsimplify posterior distributions which are concentrated on lower dimensional\nmanifolds. This approach is applicable to a whole range of problems for which\nMonte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) methods mix slowly.\n  We demonstrate the approach by considering inverse problems arising from\npartially observed stochastic reaction networks. In particular, we consider\nsystems which exhibit multiscale behaviour, but for which only the slow\nvariables in the system are observable. We demonstrate that certain multiscale\napproximations lead to more consistent approximations of the posterior than\nothers. The use of optimal transport maps stabilises the ensemble transform\nadaptive importance sampling (ETAIS) method, and allows for efficient sampling\nwith smaller ensemble sizes.

We show that this tailored algorithm can readily incorporate\nexisting ES algorithms, and outperforms the state-of-the-art on diverse\nobjective functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 09:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-01"}

Here,\nwe report the design and fabrication of highly sensitive piezotronic pressure\nsensors based on GaAs nanowire ensemble sandwiched between two electrodes in a\nback-to-back diode configuration. We analyse the current-voltage\ncharacteristics of these nanowire-based devices in response to mechanical\nloading in light of the corresponding changes to the device band structure. We\nobserve a high piezotronic sensitivity to pressure, of ~7800 meV/MPa. We\nattribute this high sensitivity to the nanowires being fully depleted due to\nthe lack of doping, as well as due to geometrical pressure focusing and current\nfunneling through polar interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 09:45:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-03"}

This stems from the fact that medical data, including genomic data, are\nan indispensable resource for further research and development regarding\ndisease prevention and treatment. To prevent personal medical data from being\nmisused, techniques to reliably preserve sensitive information should be\ndeveloped for real world application.

In this paper, we apply a Floquet-Bloch\ntransform based numerical method to reconstruct both the unknown periodic part\nand the unknown local perturbation from the near-field data.\n  By transforming the original scattering problem into one defined in an\ninfinite rectangle, the information of the surface is included in the\ncoefficients.

We compute the Fourier modes of the flow and analyse the momentum\nbalance for the mean and fundamental mode. At low wave ages, the form drag\ndisplays a large sensitivity to changes in Reynolds number, and the interaction\nbetween turbulent and wave-induced stresses increases with Reynolds number. At\nhigher wave ages, a quasi-laminar regime is entered, where the wave-induced\nstress is primarily balanced by viscous stresses. To exploit the increasing\nimportance of the wave kinematics observed in the intermediate to high wave age\nregime, a novel split system approach is introduced, where a laminar response\nto the wave forces a turbulent RANS type of shear flow . To account for the\neffects of turbulence, we force the system using Reynolds stresses from the\ncorresponding LES. We give an analytic functional dependence for the form drag\nassociated with the laminar solution. For intermediate to high wave ages, the\nform drag of the shear flow exhibits relatively simple behaviour, and we derive\napproximate functional dependencies for the quasi-laminar regime. The high\nsensitivity of the form drag to variation in Reynolds number at low wave ages\nis more challenging to evaluate using this approach. This is primarily due to\nthe increased importance of nonlinearity in the shear flow, which are\ninherently coupled with higher harmonics in the turbulent stresses.\nNevertheless, the split system approach can be utilized to quantify the\nimportance of different harmonics in the turbulent stresses by explicitly\nchoosing which modes to include in the split system forcing. We demonstrate\nthat the fundamental mode of the Reynolds stresses becomes increasingly\nimportant for accurate prediction of the form drag as the Reynolds number\nincreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 12:01:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 19:33:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

To ensure reliable control and navigation,\nconnecting UAVs to controllers via existing cellular network infrastructure,\ni.e., ground base stations (GBSs), has been proposed as a promising solution.\nNevertheless, it is highly challenging to characterize the communication\nperformance of cellular-connected UAVs, due to their unique propagation\nconditions. This paper proposes a tractable framework for the coverage analysis\nof cellular-connected UAV networks, which consists of a new blockage model and\nan effective approach to handle general fading channels. In particular, a\nline-of-sight (LoS) ball model is proposed to capture the probabilistic\npropagation in UAV communication systems, and a tractable expression is derived\nfor the Laplace transform of the aggregate interference with general Nakagami\nfading. This framework leads to a tractable expression for the coverage\nprobability, which in turn helps to investigate the impact of the GBS density.\nSpecifically, a tight lower bound on the optimal density that maximizes the\ncoverage probability is derived. Numerical results show that the proposed LoS\nball model is accurate, and the optimal GBS density decreases when the UAV\naltitude increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 12:24:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-01"}

We present such effects for both degenerate and\nhierarchical mass spectra of the heavier scalars in 2HDM. Some decay channels\nof the new scalars vanish at the alignment limit in the tree-level 2HDM. But\nthe inclusion of dim-6 terms can lead to significant cross-sections for such\nprocesses. It is also pointed out that observation of such processes can no\nlonger rule out the alignment limit if such dim-6 operators are present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 14:07:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 17:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

One\nmain challenge lies in the long-tail nature of the channel response causing\ninter-symbol-interference (ISI), which deteriorates the detection performance.\nIf the channel is unknown, we cannot easily achieve traditional coherent\nchannel estimation and cancellation, and the impact of ISI will be more severe.\nIn this paper, we develop a novel high-dimensional non-coherent scheme for\nblind detection of molecular signals. We achieve this in a higher-dimensional\nmetric space by combining different non-coherent metrics that exploit the\ntransient features of the signals. By deducing the theoretical bit error rate\n(BER) for any constructed high-dimensional non-coherent metric, we prove that,\nhigher dimensionality always achieves a lower BER in the same sample space.\nThen, we design a generalised blind detection algorithm that utilizes the\nParzen approximation and its probabilistic neural network (Parzen-PNN) to\ndetect information bits. Taking advantages of its fast convergence and parallel\nimplementation, our proposed scheme can meet the needs of detection accuracy\nand real-time computing.

We first demonstrate that if the atmosphere obeys the hydrostatic\nprimitive equations, which are a very good approximation for most terrestrial\natmospheres, and if the radiative forcing is unaltered, changes in gravity have\nno effect at all on the circulation except for a vertical rescaling. That is to\nsay, the effects of gravity may be completely scaled away and the circulation\nis unaltered.

However, a root of the quartic\nequation does not always correspond to a solution of the P3P problem. In this\nwork, we show that when the optical center is outside of all the 6 toroids\ndefined by the control point triangle, each positive root of the Grunert's\nquartic equation must correspond to a true solution of the P3P problem, and the\ncorresponding P3P problem cannot have a unique solution, it must have either 2\npositive solutions or 4 positive solutions. In addition, we show that when the\noptical center passes through any one of the 3 toroids among these 6 toroids (\nexcept possibly for two concentric circles) , the number of the solutions of\nthe corresponding P3P problem always changes by 1, either increased by 1 or\ndecreased by 1.Furthermore we show that such changed solutions always locate in\na small neighborhood of control points, hence the 3 toroids are critical\nsurfaces of the P3P problem and the 3 control points are 3 singular points of\nsolutions. A notable example is that when the optical center passes through the\nouter surface of the union of the 6 toroids from the outside to inside, the\nnumber of the solutions must always decrease by 1. Our results are the first to\ngive an explicit and geometrically intuitive relationship between the P3P\nsolutions and the roots of its quartic equation. It could act as some\ntheoretical guidance for P3P practitioners to properly arrange their control\npoints to avoid undesirable solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 17:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-01"}

For instance, in chip manufacturing,\nmany process variations are actually correlated. Recently, some techniques have\nbeen developed to handle non-Gaussian correlated random parameters, but they\nare time-consuming for high-dimensional problems. We present a new framework to\nsolve uncertainty quantification problems with many non-Gaussian correlated\nuncertainties. Firstly, we propose a set of smooth basis functions to well\ncapture the impact of non-Gaussian correlated process variations.

We present\nthree adaptive sampling approaches to improve the performance of the sparse\nsolver. Finally, we validate our methods by synthetic and practical\nelectronic/photonic ICs with 19 to 57 non-Gaussian correlated variation\nparameters.

First, different meta paths convey\ndifferent semantic meanings, while existing works assume that all nodes share\nsame weights for meta paths and ignore the personalized preferences of\ndifferent nodes on different meta paths. Second, given a meta path, nodes in\nHIN are connected by path instances while existing works fail to fully explore\nthe differences between path instances that reflect nodes' preferences in the\nsemantic space. rTo tackle the above challenges, we propose aHierarchical\nAttentive Heterogeneous information network Embedding (HAHE) model to capture\nthe personalized preferences on meta paths and path instances in each semantic\nspace.

Commonly referred to as the weight transport\nproblem, each neuron's dependence on the weights and errors located deeper in\nthe network require exhaustive data movement which presents a key problem in\nenhancing the performance and energy-efficiency of machine-learning hardware.\nIn this work, we propose a bio-plausible alternative to backpropagation drawing\nfrom advances in feedback alignment algorithms in which the error computation\nat a single synapse reduces to the product of three scalar values. Using a\nsparse feedback matrix, we show that a neuron needs only a fraction of the\ninformation previously used by the feedback alignment algorithms. Consequently,\nmemory and compute can be partitioned and distributed whichever way produces\nthe most efficient forward pass so long as a single error can be delivered to\neach neuron. Our results show orders of magnitude improvement in data movement\nand $2\\times$ improvement in multiply-and-accumulate operations over\nbackpropagation. Like previous work, we observe that any variant of feedback\nalignment suffers significant losses in classification accuracy on deep\nconvolutional neural networks. By transferring trained convolutional layers and\ntraining the fully connected layers using direct feedback alignment, we\ndemonstrate that direct feedback alignment can obtain results competitive with\nbackpropagation. Furthermore, we observe that using an extremely sparse\nfeedback matrix, rather than a dense one, results in a small accuracy drop\nwhile yielding hardware advantages.

In this paper we address the energy efficiency issue of a\nsmall scale data center by utilizing Single Board Computer (SBC) based\nclusters. A compact design layout is presented to build two clusters using 20\nnodes each. Extensive testing was carried out to analyze the performance of\nthese clusters using popular performance benchmarks for task execution time,\nmemory/storage utilization, network throughput and energy consumption. Further,\nwe investigate the cost of operating SBC based clusters by correlating energy\nutilization for the execution time of various benchmarks using workloads of\ndifferent sizes. Results show that, although the low-cost benefit of a cluster\nbuilt with ARM-based SBCs is desirable, these clusters yield low comparable\nperformance and energy efficiency due to limited onboard capabilities. It is\npossible to tweak Hadoop configuration parameters for an ARM-based SBC cluster\nto efficiently utilize resources. We present, a discussion on the effectiveness\nof the SBC-based clusters as a testbed for inexpensive and green cloud\ncomputing research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jan 2019 08:32:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-18"}
