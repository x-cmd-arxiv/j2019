We present a context-aware safety monitoring system which segments a\nsurgical task into subtasks using kinematics data and monitors safety\nconstraints specific to each subtask. To test our hypothesis about context\nspecificity of safety constraints, we analyze recorded demonstrations of\ndry-lab surgical tasks collected from the JIGSAWS database as well as from\nexperiments we conducted on a Raven II surgical robot. Analysis of the\ntrajectory data shows that each subtask of a given surgical procedure has\nconsistent safety constraints across multiple demonstrations by different\nsubjects. Our preliminary results show that violations of these safety\nconstraints lead to unsafe events, and there is often sufficient time between\nthe constraint violation and the safety-critical event to allow for a\ncorrective action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 16:51:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

The ILC can be\nupgraded to higher energy, enabling precision studies of the top quark and\nmeasurement of the top Yukawa coupling and the Higgs self-coupling. The key\naccelerator technology, superconducting radio-frequency cavities, has matured.\nOptimised collider and detector designs, and associated physics analyses, were\npresented in the ILC Technical Design Report, signed by 2400 scientists. There\nis a strong interest in Japan to host this international effort. A detailed\nreview of the many aspects of the project is nearing a conclusion in Japan. Now\nthe Japanese government is preparing for a decision on the next phase of\ninternational negotiations, that could lead to a project start within a few\nyears. The potential timeline of the ILC project includes an initial phase of\nabout 4 years to obtain international agreements, complete engineering design\nand prepare construction, and form the requisite international collaboration,\nfollowed by a construction phase of 9 years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 17:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

Notably, this\nphase transition implies an area-law for the entropy of emerging geometric\nspace. Certain vacua of the theory can be interpreted as baby universes; we\nfind that these configurations appear as stable vacua in a mean field\napproximation of our model, but are excluded dynamically whenever the action is\nexact indicating the dynamical stability of geometric space. The model is\nintended as a setting for subsequent studies of emergent time mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 18:24:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

Here, we investigate the non-potential time dependent structure\nof the magnetic field of the CBP regions with special emphasis on the time\nevolving magnetic structure at the spatial locations where the eruptions are\ninitiated. The magnetic structure is evolved in time using a Non-Linear Force\nFree Field (NLFFF) relaxation approach, based on a time series of Helioseismic\nand Magnetic Imager (HMI) longitudinal magnetograms. This results in a\ncontinuous time series of NLFFFs. The time series is initiated with a potential\nfield extrapolation based on a magnetogram taken well before the time of the\neruptions. This initial field is then evolved in time in response to the\nobserved changes in the magnetic field distribution at the photosphere. The\nlocal and global magnetic field structures from the time series of NLFFF field\nsolutions are analysed in the vicinity of the eruption sites at the approximate\ntimes of the eruptions. The analysis shows that many of the CBP eruptions\nreported in Mou etl. (2018) contain twisted flux tube located at the sites of\neruptions. The presence of flux ropes at these locations provides in many cases\na direct link between the magnetic field structure, their eruption and the\nobservation of mini coronal mass ejections (mini-CMEs). It is found that all\nrepetitive eruptions are homologous. The NLFFF simulations show that twisted\nmagnetic field structures are created at the locations hosting eruptions in\nCBPs. These twisted structures are produced by footpoint motions imposed by\nchanges in the photospheric magnetic field observations. The true nature of the\nmicro-flares remains unknown. Further 3D data-driven MHD modelling is required\nto show how these twisted regions become unstable and erupt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 18:38:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

A critical barrier in extending these results to\nlarger and asymmetric networks is the inherent combinatorial complexity of such\nnetworks. Motivated by other fields such as extremal combinatorics and extremal\ngraph theory, we explore the possibility of an extremal network theory, i.e., a\nstudy of extremal networks within particular regimes of interest. As our test\napplication, we study the GDoF benefits of transmitter cooperation in a $K$\nuser IC over the simple scheme of power control and treating interference as\nGaussian noise (TIN) for three regimes of interest -- a TIN regime where TIN\nwas shown to be GDoF optimal for the $K$ user interference channel, a CTIN\nregime where the GDoF region achievable by TIN is convex without time-sharing,\nand an SLS regime where a simple layered superposition (SLS) scheme is shown to\nbe optimal in the $K$ user MISO BC, albeit only for $K\\leq 3$. As our first\nresult, we show that under finite precision CSIT, TIN is GDoF optimal for the\n$K$ user IC throughout the CTIN regime. Furthermore, under finite precision\nCSIT, appealing to extremal network theory we obtain the following results. In\nboth TIN and CTIN regimes, we show that the extremal GDoF gain from transmitter\ncooperation over TIN is bounded regardless of the number of users: the gain is\nexactly a factor of $3/2$ in the TIN regime, and $2-1/K$ in the CTIN regime,\nfor arbitrary number of users $K>1$. However, in the SLS regime, the gain is\n$\\Theta(\\log_2(K))$, i.e., it scales logarithmically with the number of users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 18:58:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 23:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-28"}

On the\nother hand, it is very difficult for sound waves to be carried by the electron\nliquid in the ordinary metals, due to the fact that long-range Coulomb\ninteraction among electrons will generate plasmon gap for ordinary electron\ndensity fluctuation and thus prohibits the propagation of sound waves through\nit. In the present paper, we propose a unique type of acoustic collective modes\nin Weyl semimetals under the magnetic field called chiral zero sound. The\nchiral zero sound can be stabilized under so-called \"chiral limit\", where the\nintra-valley scattering time is much shorter than the inter-valley one, and\nonly propagates along an external magnetic field for Weyl semimetals with\nmultiple-pairs of Weyl points. The sound velocity of the chiral zero sound is\nproportional to the field strength in the weak field limit, whereas it\noscillates dramatically in the strong field limit, generating an entirely new\nmechanism for quantum oscillations through the dynamics of neutral bosonic\nexcitation, which may manifest itself in the thermal conductivity measurements\nunder magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 03:49:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

Here we demonstrate that\nthe region probed in transmission -- the limb -- extends significantly toward\nthe day and night sides of the planet. We show that the strong day-night\nthermal and compositional gradients expected on synchronous exoplanets create\nsufficient heterogeneities across the limb to result in important systematic\neffects on the spectrum and bias its interpretation. To quantify these effects,\nwe developed a 3D radiative transfer model able to generate transmission\nspectra of atmospheres based on 3D atmospheric structures.

A smoking-gun signature\nof such non-Abelian anyons, namely a half-integer quantized thermal Hall\nconductivity, was recently reported in $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. While fascinating, a\nmicroscopic theory for this phenomenon in $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ remains elusive\nbecause the pure Kitaev phase cannot capture these anyons appearing in an\nintermediate magnetic field.

Essentially, the adversarial process of TGAN takes place in\na tensor space. First, we impose tensor structures for concise image\nrepresentation, which is superior in capturing the pixel proximity information\nand the spatial patterns of elementary objects in images, over the\nvectorization preprocess in existing works. Secondly, we propose TGAN that\nintegrates deep convolutional generative adversarial networks and tensor\nsuper-resolution in a cascading manner, to generate high-quality images from\nrandom distributions.

The\nvariable wind of this star is known to have a 2.086 day periodicity. We use a\nsimple, heuristic spot model which fits the low velocity (near surface) IUE\nwind line variability very well, to demonstrate that the low velocity\nabsorption in the new STIS spectra of N IV 1718 and Si IV 1402 vary with the\nsame 2.086 day period. It is remarkable that the period and amplitude of the\nSTIS data agree with those of the IUE spectra obtained 22 years earlier. We\nalso show that the time variability of the new XMM fluxes are also consistent\nwith the 2.086 day period. Thus, our new, multi-wavelength coordinated\nobservations demonstrate that the mechanism which causes the UV wind line\nvariability is also responsible for a significant fraction of the X-rays in\nsingle O stars. The sequence of events for the multi-wavelength light curve\nminima is: Si IV 1402, N IV 1718, and X-ray flux, each separated by a phase of\nabout 0.06 relative to the 2.086 day period. Analysis of the X-ray fluxes shows\nthat they become softer as they weaken. This is contrary to expectations if the\nvariability is caused by periodic excess absorption. Further, the high\nresolution X-ray spectra suggest that the individual emission lines at maximum\nare more strongly blue shifted.\n  If we interpret the low velocity wind line light curves in terms of our\nmodel, it implies that there are two bright regions, i.e., regions with less\nabsorption, separated by 180 deg, on the surface of the star. We note that the\npresence and persistent of two spots separated by 180 deg suggests that a weak\ndipole magnetic field is responsible for the variability of the UV wind line\nabsorption and X-ray flux in xi Per.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 19:36:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

Such hyperuniform\nsystems are characterized by an anomalous suppression of volume-fraction\nfluctuations at infinitely long-wavelengths, compared to ordinary disordered\nmaterials. While there has been growing interest in such singular states of\namorphous matter, a major obstacle has been an inability to produce large\nhyperuniform samples due to practical limitations of conventional methods. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce a general theoretical methodology to\nconstruct perfectly hyperuniform packings in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space.\nSpecifically, beginning with an initial general tessellation of space that\nmeets a \"bounded-cell\" condition, hard particles are placed inside each cell\nsuch that the packing fraction within the cell becomes identical to the global\npacking fraction. We prove that the constructed packings are perfectly\nhyperuniform in the infinite-sample-size limit and their hyperuniformity is\nindependent of particle shapes, positions, and numbers per cell. We employ two\ndistinct types of initial tessellations: Voronoi as well as sphere\ntessellations. Beginning with Voronoi tessellations, we show that our algorithm\ncan remarkably convert extremely large nonhyperuniform packings into\nhyperuniform ones in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Implementing our\ntheoretical methodology on sphere tessellations, we establish the\nhyperuniformity of the classical Hashin-Shtrikman multiscale coated-spheres\nstructures that possess optimal effective transport and elastic properties.

Artificial noise (AN) is deliberately transmitted\nsimultaneously with the confidential signals to degrade the eavesdropper's\nchannel quality. By applying the Bussgang theorem, a DAC quantization model is\ndeveloped which facilitates the analysis of the asymptotic achievable secrecy\nrate. Interestingly, for a fixed power allocation factor $\\phi$, low-resolution\nDACs typically result in a secrecy rate loss, but in certain cases they provide\nsuperior performance, e.g., at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Compared with the traditional approaches, the\nproposed scheme not only simplifies the algorithmic framework without imposing\nany specific assumption on the network model but also guarantees convergence in\npolynomial time. The results show that, during average delays, the proposed\nreinforcement learning-based offloading method achieves significant performance\nimprovements over the variation of service rate and traffic arrival rate. The\nproposed algorithm achieves 1.17%, 1.02%, and 3.21% lower overload probability\nrelative to random, least-queue and nearest offloading selection schemes,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 22:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

In the presence of long-range interactions, the\nformation and decay of particle-antiparticle bound states can also deplete dark\nmatter significantly. We consider the Higgs boson as mediator in the formation\nof bound states, and compute the effect on the dark matter abundance. To this\nend, we consider a simplified model in which dark matter co-annihilates with\ncoloured particles that have a sizeable coupling to the Higgs. The\nHiggs-mediated force affects the dark matter depletion via bound state\nformation in several ways. It enhances the capture cross-sections due to the\nattraction it mediates between the incoming particles, it increases the binding\nenergy of the bound states, hence rendering their ionisation inefficient sooner\nin the early universe, and for large enough couplings, it can overcome the\ngluon repulsion of certain colour representations and give rise to additional\nbound states. Because it alters the momentum exchange in the bound states, the\nHiggs-mediated force also affects the gluon-mediated potential via the running\nof the strong coupling.

A classic proposal for detecting such magnetic charges is to measure the\nquantized jump in magnetic flux $\\Phi$ threading the loop of a superconducting\nquantum interference device (SQUID) when a monopole passes through it.\nNaturally, with the theoretical discovery that a plasma of emergent magnetic\ncharges should exist in several lanthanide-pyrochlore magnetic insulators,\nincluding Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, this SQUID technique was proposed for their direct\ndetection. Experimentally, this has proven extremely challenging because of the\nhigh number density, and the generation-recombination (GR) fluctuations, of the\nmonopole plasma. Recently, however, theoretical advances have allowed the\nspectral density of magnetic-flux noise $S_{\\Phi}(\\omega,T)$ due to GR\nfluctuations of $\\pm m_*$ magnetic charge pairs to be determined. These\ntheories present a sequence of strikingly clear predictions for the\nmagnetic-flux noise signature of emergent magnetic monopoles.

Virtually all the elements\nof $S_{\\Phi}(\\omega,T)$ predicted for a magnetic monopole plasma, including the\nexistence of intense magnetization noise and its characteristic frequency and\ntemperature dependence, are detected directly. Moreover, comparisons of\nsimulated and measured correlation functions $C_{\\Phi}(t)$ of the magnetic-flux\nnoise $\\Phi(t)$ imply that the motion of magnetic charges is strongly\ncorrelated because traversal of the same trajectory by two magnetic charges of\nsame sign is forbidden.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 00:13:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 19:09:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}

This\ndissertation provides in-depth exploration of these important aspects, and\nproposes effective techniques for low-cost switching architectures and resource\nallocation algorithms to facilitate the adoption of optical networks in the\nnear future.\n  The dramatic growth of Internet traffic brings challenges for optical network\ndesigners. The increasing traffic and bandwidth requirements mean that various\nresource allocation schemes to achieve different network design goals assume\ngreat importance. The general problem of resource allocation to lightpath\nrequests is a challenging problem.\n  An emerging technology of flexible and more fine-grained grid through the use\nof Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OOFDM) allows fiber\nbandwidth to be more suitably matched up with application requirements, thereby\nmaking the network more elastic than the conventional Wavelength Division\nMultiplexing (WDM) optical networks.

In the present work, we investigate Fuchs' problem\nfor the class of $p$-groups. Ditor provided a solution in the finite,\nodd-primary case in 1970.

Recent work has shown that iterative projection methods\nare able to solve metric-constrained optimization problems on a much larger\nscale than was previously possible, thanks to their comparatively low memory\nrequirement. However, the major limitation of projection methods is their slow\nconvergence rate. In this paper we present a parallel projection method for\nmetric-constrained optimization which allows us to speed up the convergence\nrate in practice. The key to our approach is a new parallel execution schedule\nthat allows us to perform projections at multiple metric constraints\nsimultaneously without any conflicts or locking of variables.

In this paper, we first discuss the features and benefits\nof a stealth communication network (SNET), and then we propose a theoretical\nframework that can be adopted to implement an SNET. By utilizing the framework\nand the existing publicly available cloud storage, we present the\nimplementation details of an instance of SNET, named Secret-Share.

How to exploit underlying person structure\ninformation without extra annotations to improve the performance of person\nre-ID remains largely unexplored. To address this problem, we propose a novel\nRelative Local Distance (RLD) method that integrates a relative local distance\nconstraint into convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in an end-to-end way. It\nis the first time that the relative local constraint is proposed to guide the\nglobal feature representation learning. Specially, a relative local distance\nmatrix is computed by using feature maps and then regarded as a regularizer to\nguide CNNs to learn a structure-aware feature representation. With the\ndiscovered underlying person structure, the RLD method builds a bridge between\nthe global and local feature representation and thus improves the capacity of\nfeature representation for person re-ID. Furthermore, RLD also significantly\naccelerates deep network training compared with conventional methods.

In this paper, we address\nthis gap by presenting Glyce, the glyph-vectors for Chinese character\nrepresentations. We make three major innovations: (1) We use historical Chinese\nscripts (e.g., bronzeware script, seal script, traditional Chinese, etc) to\nenrich the pictographic evidence in characters; (2) We design CNN structures\n(called tianzege-CNN) tailored to Chinese character image processing; and (3)\nWe use image-classification as an auxiliary task in a multi-task learning setup\nto increase the model's ability to generalize.

Away from\nthis point, the crystal point group symmetry causes anisotropic effects on the\nsurface spectrum where a number of unusual effects are experimentally observed.\nIn particular, the perturbative violations of the perpendicular spin-momentum\nlocking frequently observed in many experiments remains to be a poorly\nunderstood feature theoretically. In parallel, the existence of electron-phonon\ninteraction has been unquestionably verified by a number of experimental\ngroups. In this article, we device an interacting theory of the spin texture\nusing the spin-dependent self-energy formalism.

In\nparticular, the experimental observation of the six-fold symmetric modulation\nof the in-plane spin in the $Bi_{2-y}Sb_ySe_{3-x}Te_x$ family and the resulting\nviolation of the spin-momentum locking is explained using the coupling of an\noptical surface phonon to the surface electrons reported in earlier\nexperiments.

Recently,\ndeep-convolutional-neural-networks based methods have achieved promising\nresults in the monocular depth estimation field. Specifically, the framework\nthat combines the multi-scale features extracted by the dilated convolution\nbased block (atrous spatial pyramid pooling, ASPP) has gained the significant\nimprovement in the dense labeling task. However, the discretized and predefined\ndilation rates cannot capture the continuous context information that differs\nin diverse scenes and easily introduce the grid artifacts in depth estimation.\nIn this paper, we propose an attention-based context aggregation network (ACAN)\nto tackle these difficulties. Based on the self-attention model, ACAN\nadaptively learns the task-specific similarities between pixels to model the\ncontext information. First, we recast the monocular depth estimation as a dense\nlabeling multi-class classification problem. Then we propose a soft ordinal\ninference to transform the predicted probabilities to continuous depth values,\nwhich can reduce the discretization error (about 1% decrease in RMSE). Second,\nthe proposed ACAN aggregates both the image-level and pixel-level context\ninformation for depth estimation, where the former expresses the statistical\ncharacteristic of the whole image and the latter extracts the long-range\nspatial dependencies for each pixel. Third, for further reducing the\ninconsistency between the RGB image and depth map, we construct an attention\nloss to minimize their information entropy. We evaluate on public monocular\ndepth-estimation benchmark datasets (including NYU Depth V2, KITTI). The\nexperiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed ACAN and achieve the\ncompetitive results with the state of the arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 07:01:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

In fact,\nother data factors, such as small disjuncts, noises and overlapping, also play\nthe roles in tandem with imbalance ratio, which makes the problem difficult.\nThus far, the empirical studies have demonstrated the relationship between the\nimbalance ratio and other data factors only. To the best of our knowledge,\nthere is no any measurement about the extent of influence of class imbalance on\nthe classification performance of imbalanced data. Further, it is also unknown\nfor a dataset which data factor is actually the main barrier for\nclassification. In this paper, we focus on Bayes optimal classifier and study\nthe influence of class imbalance from a theoretical perspective. Accordingly,\nwe propose an instance measure called Individual Bayes Imbalance Impact Index\n($IBI^3$) and a data measure called Bayes Imbalance Impact Index ($BI^3$).\n$IBI^3$ and $BI^3$ reflect the extent of influence purely by the factor of\nimbalance in terms of each minority class sample and the whole dataset,\nrespectively. Therefore, $IBI^3$ can be used as an instance complexity measure\nof imbalance and $BI^3$ is a criterion to show the degree of how imbalance\ndeteriorates the classification. As a result, we can therefore use $BI^3$ to\njudge whether it is worth using imbalance recovery methods like sampling or\ncost-sensitive methods to recover the performance loss of a classifier. The\nexperiments show that $IBI^3$ is highly consistent with the increase of\nprediction score made by the imbalance recovery methods and $BI^3$ is highly\nconsistent with the improvement of F1 score made by the imbalance recovery\nmethods on both synthetic and real benchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 08:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

Researchers have proposed many supervised Re-ID\nmodels which require quantities of cross-view pairwise labelled data. This\nlimits their scalabilities to many applications where a large amount of data\nfrom multiple disjoint camera views is available but unlabelled. Although some\nunsupervised Re-ID models have been proposed to address the scalability\nproblem, they often suffer from the view-specific bias problem which is caused\nby dramatic variances across different camera views, e.g., different\nillumination, viewpoints and occlusion. The dramatic variances induce specific\nfeature distortions in different camera views, which can be very disturbing in\nfinding cross-view discriminative information for Re-ID in the unsupervised\nscenarios, since no label information is available to help alleviate the bias.\nWe propose to explicitly address this problem by learning an unsupervised\nasymmetric distance metric based on cross-view clustering. The asymmetric\ndistance metric allows specific feature transformations for each camera view to\ntackle the specific feature distortions. We then design a novel unsupervised\nloss function to embed the asymmetric metric into a deep neural network, and\ntherefore develop a novel unsupervised deep framework named the DEep\nClustering-based Asymmetric MEtric Learning (DECAMEL). In such a way, DECAMEL\njointly learns the feature representation and the unsupervised asymmetric\nmetric. DECAMEL learns a compact cross-view cluster structure of Re-ID data,\nand thus help alleviate the view-specific bias and facilitate mining the\npotential cross-view discriminative information for unsupervised Re-ID.\nExtensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets whose sizes span several\norders show the effectiveness of our framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 08:49:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-08"}

It encodes the online\nstreaming data into compact binary codes, and simultaneously updates the hash\nfunctions to renew codes of the existing dataset. To this end, the existing\nmethods update hash functions solely based on the new data batch, without\ninvestigating the correlation between such new data and the existing dataset.\nIn addition, existing works update the hash functions using a relaxation\nprocess in its corresponding approximated continuous space. And it remains as\nan open problem to directly apply discrete optimizations in online hashing. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel supervised online hashing method, termed\nBalanced Similarity for Online Discrete Hashing (BSODH), to solve the above\nproblems in a unified framework. BSODH employs a well-designed hashing\nalgorithm to preserve the similarity between the streaming data and the\nexisting dataset via an asymmetric graph regularization. We further identify\nthe \"data-imbalance\" problem brought by the constructed asymmetric graph, which\nrestricts the application of discrete optimization in our problem. Therefore, a\nnovel balanced similarity is further proposed, which uses two equilibrium\nfactors to balance the similar and dissimilar weights and eventually enables\nthe usage of discrete optimizations.

Nonetheless, theoretical analyses accompanying these\nstudies result in complex expressions that fail to provide a direct estimate of\nsaid impulse threshold.

Differentially private machine\nlearning can help by guaranteeing that the published results do not leak too\nmuch information about any individual data point. Recent research has reached\npromising results on differentially private drug sensitivity prediction using\ngene expression data. Differentially private learning with genomic data is\nchallenging because it is more difficult to guarantee the privacy in high\ndimensions. Dimensionality reduction can help, but if the dimension reduction\nmapping is learned from the data, then it needs to be differentially private\ntoo, which can carry a significant privacy cost.

The Balmer jump is produced by a rapid drop of the total Balmer\ncross-section, yet this variation is smooth and continuous when both\nbound-bound and bound-free processes are taken into account, and its shape and\nlocation is dependent on the broadening mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 12:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

Recently, a\nfundamentally different approach was introduced with the Pairwise\nDifferentiable Gradient Descent (PDGD) algorithm. To date the only comparisons\nof the two approaches are limited to simulations with cascading click models\nand low levels of noise. The main outcome so far is that PDGD converges at\nhigher levels of performance and learns considerably faster than DBGD-based\nmethods. However, the PDGD algorithm assumes cascading user behavior,\npotentially giving it an unfair advantage. Furthermore, the robustness of both\nmethods to high levels of noise has not been investigated. Therefore, it is\nunclear whether the reported advantages of PDGD over DBGD generalize to\ndifferent experimental conditions. In this paper, we investigate whether the\nprevious conclusions about the PDGD and DBGD comparison generalize from ideal\nto worst-case circumstances. We do so in two ways. First, we compare the\ntheoretical properties of PDGD and DBGD, by taking a critical look at\npreviously proven properties in the context of ranking. Second, we estimate an\nupper and lower bound on the performance of methods by simulating both ideal\nuser behavior and extremely difficult behavior, i.e., almost-random\nnon-cascading user models. Our findings show that the theoretical bounds of\nDBGD do not apply to any common ranking model and, furthermore, that the\nperformance of DBGD is substantially worse than PDGD in both ideal and\nworst-case circumstances. These results reproduce previously published findings\nabout the relative performance of PDGD vs. DBGD and generalize them to\nextremely noisy and non-cascading circumstances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 13:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

This skew\ngoes beyond that which already exists in the world - e.g., Kay et al. showed\nthat although 28% of CEOs in US are women, only 10% of the top 100 results for\nCEO in Google Image Search are women. Most existing approaches to correct for\nthis kind of bias assume that the images of people include socially salient\nattribute labels. However, such labels are often unknown. Further, using\nautomated techniques to infer these labels may often not be possible within\nacceptable accuracy ranges, and may not be desirable due to the additional\nbiases this process could incur. We develop a novel approach that takes as\ninput a visibly diverse control set of images and uses this set to select a set\nof images of people in response to a query. The goal is to have a resulting set\nthat is more visibly diverse in a manner that emulates the diversity depicted\nin the control set. Importantly, this approach does not require images to be\nlabelled at any point; effectively, it gives a way to implicitly diversify the\nset of images selected. We provide two variants of our approach: the first is a\nmodification of the MMR algorithm to incorporate the diversity scores, and\nsecond is a more efficient variant that does not consider within-list\nredundancy. We evaluate these approaches empirically on two datasets 1) a new\ndataset containing top Google image results for 96 occupations, for which we\nevaluate gender and skin-tone diversity with respect to occupations and 2) the\nCelebA dataset for which we evaluate gender diversity with respect to facial\nfeatures.

This is due to the more pronounced central cores or bulges rather\nthan the onset of a `quenching' process. While galaxies that lie significantly\nabove (or below) the star formation main sequence (SFMS) show overall an\nelevation (or suppression) of $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ at all radii, this central\nelevation (or suppression) is more pronounced in more massive galaxies.

This suggests that we are\nseeing the response of a simple gas-regulator system to variations in the\naccretion rate. This is explored using a heuristic model that can\nquantitatively explain the dependence of $\\sigma(\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR})$ on gas\ndepletion timescale. Variations in accretion rate are progressively more damped\nout in regions of low star-formation efficiency leading to a reduced amplitude\nof variations in star-formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 13:36:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 10:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

A hybrid NJL model is\nused in which a Dirac sea of quarks is combined with a Fermi sea of quarks or\nof nucleons. In the model mesons are described as collective $\\bar qq$\nexcitations and the nucleon appears as a baryon-number-one soliton of $N_c$\nvalence quarks coupled to both Dirac and Fermi sea. According to the model at\nsome critical density and/or temperature phase transitions from nucleons to\nquarks as well as from Goldstone to Wigner phase are expected. At finite\ndensity the chiral order parameter and the constituent quark mass have a\nnon-monotonic temperature dependence-at temperatures not close to the critical\none they are less affected than in cold matter. The quark matter is rather soft\nagainst thermal fluctuations and the corresponding chiral phase transition is\nsmooth. The nucleon matter is much stiffer and the phase transition is very\nsharp. In the case of quark matter a first-order transition is suggested at low\ntemperatures ($T<80$ MeV) which changes to a second-order one at higher\ntemperatures. In contrast to the quark matter in the case of nucleon matter the\nthermodynamic variables show large discontinuities which is a clear indication\nfor a first-order phase transition. In hot medium at intermediate temperature\nthe nucleon soliton is more bound and less swelled than in the case of cold\nmatter. At some critical temperature, which for nucleon matter coincides with\nthe critical temperature for the phase transition, no more a localized solution\nis found. According to this model scenario one should expect a first-order\nphase transition from nucleon to quark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 13:44:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

The interaction\nHamiltonian, derived from an action principle that classically generates the\nPeach-Koehler force, is a power series of creation and annihilation operators.\nThe leading term is quadratic, and keeping only this term the observable\nquantities of scattering processes are computed to all orders in perturbation\ntheory. The resulting theory is characterized by the magnitude of $kL$, with\n$k$ the wavenumber of an incident phonon. The theory is solved for arbitrary\n$kL$, and different limits are explored. A significant result at this level is\nthe scattering cross section for phonons by dislocation segments. This cross\nsection has a much richer structure than the linear-in-frequency behavior that\nis inferred from scattering by an infinite, static, dislocation. When many\ndislocations are present, an effective mass operator is computed in the Weak\nand Independent Scattering Approximation. The contribution of the cubic terms\nis computed to leading order in perturbation theory, allowing for a comparison\nof the scattering of a phonon by excited dislocations and three-phonon\nscattering, as well as studying the dependence of scattering amplitudes on the\ntemperature of the solid.

Therefore, training samples\n(instances and labels) are used to deduct classification hypotheses. Often, it\nis relatively easy to capture instances but the acquisition of the\ncorresponding labels remain difficult or expensive. Active learning algorithms\nselect the most beneficial instances to be labeled to reduce cost. In research,\nthis labeling procedure is simulated and therefore a ground truth is available.\nBut during deployment, active learning is a one-shot problem and an evaluation\nset is not available. Hence, it is not possible to reliably estimate the\nperformance of the classification system during learning and it is difficult to\ndecide when the system fulfills the quality requirements (stopping criteria).\nIn this article, we formalize the task and review existing strategies to assess\nthe performance of an actively trained classifier during training.

Jet substructure\ntechniques are increasingly used in experimental analyses by the LHC\ncollaborations, both in the context of searching for new physics and for\nStandard Model measurements. On the theory side, the quest for a deeper\nunderstanding of jet substructure algorithms has contributed to a renewed\ninterest in all-order calculations in QCD. This has resulted in new ideas about\nhow to design better observables and how to provide a solid theoretical\ndescription for them. In the last years, jet substructure has seen its scope\nextended, for example, with an increasing impact in the study of heavy-ion\ncollisions, or with the exploration of deep-learning techniques. Furthermore,\njet physics is an area in which experimental and theoretical approaches meet\ntogether, where cross-pollination and collaboration between the two communities\noften bear the fruits of innovative techniques. Despite the wealth of\nliterature on this topic, we feel that a comprehensive and, at the same time,\npedagogical introduction to jet substructure is still missing.

The proposed framework is based on the\nGenetic Algorithm (GenAlg), where populations (i.e., collections) of\ninformation sets evolve successively via evolutionary transformations based on\ntheir individual error-rate performance. These populations converge towards an\ninformation set that fits both the decoding behavior and the defined channel.\nUsing our proposed algorithm over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)\nchannel, we construct a polar code of length 2048 with code rate 0.5, without\nthe CRC-aid, tailored to plain successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding,\nachieving the same error-rate performance as the CRC-aided SCL decoding, and\nleading to a coding gain of 1 dB at BER of $10^{-6}$. Further, a belief\npropagation (BP)-tailored construction approaches the SCL error-rate\nperformance without any modifications in the decoding algorithm itself. The\nperformance gains can be attributed to the significant reduction in the total\nnumber of low-weight codewords. To demonstrate the flexibility, coding gains\nfor the Rayleigh channel are shown under SCL and BP decoding. Besides\nimprovements in error-rate performance, we show that, when required, the GenAlg\ncan be also set up to reduce the decoding complexity, e.g., the SCL list size\nor the number of BP iterations can be reduced, while maintaining the same\nerror-rate performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 22:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-31"}

This energy generates a new\neffect of the vacuum polarization and it has the state equation of the\ncosmological constant, $w = -1$. This result holds for any homogeneous and\nisotropic curved space-time, as well as for diagonal metrics. Numerical\nestimates of the corrections to the oscillation formulae are presented by\nconsidering the intensity of the magnetic field available in the laboratory.\nMoreover, we estimate the vacuum energy density induced by axion--photon mixing\nin the Minkowski space-time. A value compatible with that of the energy density\nof the universe can be obtained for axions with a mass of $(10^{-3}-10^{-2})\neV$ in the presence of the strong magnetic fields that characterize\nastrophysical objects such as pulsars or neutron stars. In addition, a value of\nthe energy density less than that of the Casimir effect is obtained for\nmagnetic fields used in experiments such as PVLAS.

This of course\nis nothing other than the protocol used in experimental science when exploring\nnew phenomena. We believe such a tool can give decision makers much better\ninsight. In the present paper we illustrate this analysis by considering\nchallenges, that span more than a century, to US hegemony in the Pacific. The\noutcomes suggest that it is only through the sidelining of one of the\ncontenders that the confrontation will end. At the time of writing (late 2018)\nearly evidence of this confrontation is already visible at three levels. (i)\nGrowing US concerns for domestic security that are leading to a new form of\nMcCarthyism. (ii) Political instability due to China-US polarization in several\nAsian countries as well as in the countries participating in the Belt and Road\nInitiative. (iii) Tension and sanctions in procurement and trade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 14:45:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-19"}

This tsunami of connectivity and data collection relies more and\nmore on the Cloud, where data analytics and intelligence actually reside. Cloud\ncomputing has indeed revolutionized the way computational resources and\nservices can be used and accessed, implementing the concept of utility\ncomputing whose advantages are undeniable for every business. However, despite\nthe benefits in terms of flexibility, economic savings, and support of new\nservices, its widespread adoption is hindered by the security issues arising\nwith its usage. From a security perspective, the technological revolution\nintroduced by IoT and Cloud computing can represent a disaster, as each object\nmight become inherently remotely hackable and, as a consequence, controllable\nby malicious actors. While the literature mostly focuses on security of IoT and\nCloud computing as separate entities, in this article we provide an up-to-date\nand well-structured survey of the security issues of Cloud computing in the IoT\nera. We give a clear picture of where security issues occur and what their\npotential impact is. As a result, we claim that it is not enough to secure IoT\ndevices, as cyber-storms come from Clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 20:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

There were truly plural and independent approaches\nincorporating cosmic expansion but without time evolution of the total\ncosmological density, thanks to the inclusion of some processes of continuous\nmatter creation. We distinguish here three different independent motivations\nleading to a stationary vision of the universe. First, Einstein's concerns on\nthe asymptotic behaviour of gravitation led him to consider continuous matter\ncreation in a recently discovered unpublished work dated of 1931. Second, there\nis the quest by Dirac and Jordan for a scientific explanation of numerical\ncoincidences in the values of fundamental constants, leading both to a time\nvariation of Newton's constant and spontaneous matter creation. The third one\nappears in the steady-state theory of Bondi and Gold as the postulate of the\nPerfect Cosmological Principle according to which the properties of the\nuniverse do not depend in any way of the location and the epoch of the\nobserver. Hoyle developed a mathematical model of spontaneous matter creation\nfrom a modification of general relativity that should be considered as a direct\nlegacy of Einstein's and Dirac's approaches. Hoyle's model allows obtaining a\n\"\\textit{wide cosmological principle}\" as an end-product, echoing Bondi and\nGold's Perfect Cosmological Principle. Somewhat ironically, many modern key\nquestions in hot Big Bang cosmology, like dark energy and inflation, can\ntherefore be directly related to the physical motivations of the early\nstationary cosmologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 16:49:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

We find that the Jastrow correlated Antisymmetrized Geminal\nPower (JAGP) is able to recover most of the correlation energy even when the\ngeometry is symmetric and the hydrogens lie on the edges of a perfect square.\nUnder such conditions the diradical character of the molecule ground state\nprevents a single determinant ansatz to achieve an acceptable accuracy, whereas\nthe JAGP performs very well for all geometries. Remarkably, this is obtained\nwith a similar computational effort. Moreover we find that the Jastrow Factor\nis fundamental in promoting the correct resonances among several configurations\nin the JAGP, that cannot show up in the pure Antisymmetrized Geminal Power\n(AGP). We also show the extremely fast convergence of this approach in the\nextension of the basis set.
