However, in many real\napplications, data are coming with multiple graphs, and it is non-trivial to\nadapt GCNs to deal with data representation with multiple graph structures. One\nmain challenge for multi-graph representation is how to exploit both structure\ninformation of each individual graph and correlation information across\nmultiple graphs simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel Multiple\nGraph Adversarial Learning (MGAL) framework for multi-graph representation and\nlearning. MGAL aims to learn an optimal structure-invariant and consistent\nrepresentation for multiple graphs in a common subspace via a novel adversarial\nlearning framework, which thus incorporates both structure information of\nintra-graph and correlation information of inter-graphs simultaneously. Based\non MGAL, we then provide a unified network for semi-supervised learning task.\nPromising experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MGAL model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 16:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

For systems of degrading components, this can\nbe a particularly difficult problem because of the dependent degradation and\ndependent failure times.

The determination of optimal on-condition thresholds for all\ncomponents is effective to avoid failure and to minimize cost.

We prove the existence of an optimal control and obtain first\norder necessary optimality conditions for both the drug concentration and the\ntreatment time. One of the main aim of the control problem is to realize in the\nbest possible way a desired final distribution of the tumor cells, which is\nexpressed by the target function $\\phi_\\Omega$. By establishing the Lyapunov\nstability of certain equilibria of the state system (without external source),\nwe see that $\\phi_{\\Omega}$ can be taken as a stable configuration, so that the\ntumor will not grow again once the finite-time treatment is completed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 18:20:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

In\nthis paper, we present an approach based on model-free Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) to control recovery maneuvers of quadrupedal robots using a\nhierarchical behavior-based controller. The controller consists of four neural\nnetwork policies including three behaviors and one behavior selector to\ncoordinate them. Each of them is trained individually in simulation and\ndeployed directly on a real system. We experimentally validate our approach on\nthe quadrupedal robot ANYmal, which is a dog-sized quadrupedal system with 12\ndegrees of freedom. With our method, ANYmal manifests dynamic and reactive\nrecovery behaviors to recover from an arbitrary fall configuration within less\nthan 5 seconds.

However, their very existence\nand formation environment in the early Universe are still under debate, with\ntheir supposed rarity further exacerbating the problem of modeling their\nab-initio formation. SMS models have shown that rapid collapse, with an infall\nrate above a critical value, in metal-free haloes is a requirement for the\nformation of a proto-stellar core which will then form an SMS. Using a\nradiation hydrodynamics simulation of early galaxy formation, we show the\nnatural emergence of metal-free haloes both massive enough, and with\nsufficiently high infall rates, to form an SMS. We find that haloes that are\nexposed to both a Lyman-Werner intensity of J_LW ~ 3 J_21 and that undergo at\nleast one period of rapid growth early in their evolution are ideal cradles for\nSMS formation. This rapid growth induces substantial dynamical heating,\namplifying the existing Lyman-Werner suppression originating from a group of\nyoung galaxies 20 kiloparsecs away. Our results strongly indicate that\nstructure formation dynamics, rather than a critical Lyman-Werner (LW) flux,\nmay be the main driver of massive black hole formation in the early Universe.\nWe find that massive black hole seeds may be much more common in overdense\nregions of the early Universe than previously considered with a comoving number\ndensity up to 10^-3 Mpc^-3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-21"}

This inference is performed by combining the Besancon Galaxy\nModel fast approximate simulations (BGM FASt) and an approximate Bayesian\ncomputation algorithm. We find in Gaia DR2 data an imprint of a star formation\nburst 2-3 Gyr ago, in the Galactic thin disc domain, and a present star\nformation rate (SFR) of about 1 Msun. Our results show a decreasing trend of\nthe SFR from 9-10 Gyr to 6-7 Gyr ago. This is consistent with the cosmological\nstar formation quenching observed at redshifts z<1.8.

We find a clear hierarchy of these\ntimescales; a binary's center-of-mass motion is slowed over a shorter timescale\nthan the pair inspirals or accretes. In contrast to previous analytic\npredictions, which assume an unperturbed background medium, we find that the\ntimescale for orbital inspiral is proportional to the semi-major axis to the\n$0.19 \\pm 0.01$ power. This positive scaling indicates that gaseous drag forces\ncan drive binaries either to coalescence or to the critical separation at which\ngravitational radiation dominates their further evolution. We discuss the\nimplications of our results for binaries embedded in the interstellar medium,\nactive galactic nuclei disks, and common envelope phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 19:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 22:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

While in electronic systems the driving by AC electric fields\nproduces radiation from the dynamics of excited charges, we consider here the\nsituation where spin systems excited by a magnetic field pulse generate\nradiation via a time-dependent magnetization. Specifically, we study the\nmagnetic dipole radiation in two types of ferromagnetic spin chain models, the\nIsing model with static longitudinal field and the XXZ model, and reveal the\nstructure of the spin HHG and its relation to spin excitations. For weak laser\namplitude, a peak structure appears which can be explained by time-dependent\nperturbation theory. With increasing amplitude, plateaus with well-defined\ncutoff energies emerge. In the Ising model with longitudinal field, the\nthresholds of the multiple plateaus in the radiation spectra can be explained\nby the annihilation of multiple magnons. In the XXZ model, which retains the\n$\\mathbf{Z}_{2}$ symmetry, the laser magnetic field can induce a phase\ntransition of the ground state when it exceeds a critical value, which results\nin a drastic change of the spin excitation character. As a consequence, the\nfirst cutoff energy in the HHG spectrum changes from a single-magnon to a\ntwo-magnon energy at this transition. Our results demonstrate the possibility\nof generating high-harmonic radiation from magnetically ordered materials and\nthe usefulness of high-harmonic signals for extracting information on the spin\nexcitation spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 19:17:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 18:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-24"}

Practical\nand automated methods that can infer causality are difficult to find, and the\nsubject of ongoing research. While Shannon information only detects\ncorrelation, there are several information-theoretic notions of \"directed\ninformation\" that have successfully detected causality in some systems, in\nparticular in the neuroscience community. However, recent work has shown that\nsome directed information measures can sometimes inadequately estimate the\nextent of causal relations, or even fail to identify existing cause-effect\nrelations between components of systems, especially if neurons contribute in a\ncryptographic manner to influence the effector neuron. Here, we test how often\ncryptographic logic emerges in an evolutionary process that generates\nartificial neural circuits for two fundamental cognitive tasks: motion\ndetection and sound localization. We also test whether activity time-series\nrecorded from behaving digital brains can infer information flow using the\ntransfer entropy concept, when compared to a ground-truth model of causal\ninfluence constructed from connectivity and circuit logic. Our results suggest\nthat transfer entropy will sometimes fail to infer causality when it exists,\nand sometimes suggest a causal connection when there is none. However, the\nextent of incorrect inference strongly depends on the cognitive task\nconsidered. These results emphasize the importance of understanding the\nfundamental logic processes that contribute to information flow in cognitive\nprocessing, and quantifying their relevance in any given nervous system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 19:19:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 04:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Subsequently, we present a novel framework for uncertainty\nbased class imbalance learning that follows two key insights: First,\nclassification boundaries should be extended further away from a more uncertain\n(rare) class to avoid overfitting and enhance its generalization. Second, each\nsample should be modeled as a multi-variate Gaussian distribution with a mean\nvector and a covariance matrix defined by the sample's uncertainty.

Precise and\ncomprehensive observations of the convective blueshift and its center-to-limb\nvariation improve our understanding of the atmospheric hydrodynamics and\nensuing line formation, and provide the basis to refine 3D models of the solar\natmosphere. We performed systematical spectroscopic measurements of the\nconvective blueshift of the quiet Sun with the Laser Absolute Reference\nSpectrograph (LARS) at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope. The spatial scanning\nof the solar disk covered four radial (meridional and equatorial) axes. The\nhigh-resolution spectra of 26 photospheric to chromospheric lines in the\nvisible range were calibrated with a laser frequency comb to absolute\nwavelengths at the 1m/s accuracy. Applying ephemeris and reference corrections,\nthe bisector analysis provided line asymmetries and Doppler shifts with an\nuncertainty of only few m/s. To allow for a comparison with other observations,\nwe convolved the results to lower spectral resolutions. Typically, a\nblueshifted \"C\"-shaped curve at disk center transforms into a less blueshifted\n\"\\\"-shape toward the solar limb. The comparison of all lines reveals the\nsystematic dependence of the convective blueshift on the line depth. Synthetic\nmodels yield considerable deviations from the observed center-to-limb\nvariation. The obtained Doppler shifts of the quiet Sun can serve as an\nabsolute reference for other observations, the relative calibration of\nDopplergrams, and the necessary refinement of atmospheric models.

Some transit observers envision future public transit to be integrated\ntransit systems with fixed-route services running along major corridors and\non-demand ridesharing services covering lower-density areas. A switch from a\nconventional fixed-route service model to this kind of integrated\nmobility-on-demand transit system, however, may elicit varied responses from\nlocal residents. This paper evaluates traveler preferences for a proposed\nintegrated mobility-on-demand transit system versus the existing fixed-route\nsystem, with a particular focus on disadvantaged travelers. We conducted a\nsurvey in two low-resource communities in the United States, namely, Detroit\nand Ypsilanti, Michigan. A majority of survey respondents preferred a\nmobility-on-demand transit system over a fixed-route one. Based on ordered\nlogit model outputs, we found a stronger preference for mobility-on-demand\ntransit among males, college graduates, individuals who have never heard of or\nused ride-hailing before, and individuals who currently receive inferior\ntransit services. By contrast, preferences varied little by age, income, race,\nor disability status. The most important benefit of a mobility-on-demand\ntransit system perceived by the survey respondents is enhanced transit\naccessibility to different destinations, whereas their major concerns include\nthe need to actively request rides, possible transit-fare increases, and\npotential technological failures. Addressing the concerns of female riders and\naccommodating the needs of less technology-proficient individuals should be\nmajor priorities for transit agencies that are considering mobility-on-demand\ninitiatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 20:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-24"}

However,\nCFR's reliance on full game-tree traversals limits its scalability. For this\nreason, the game's state- and action-space is often abstracted (i.e.\nsimplified) for CFR, and the resulting strategy is then translated back to the\nfull game, which requires extensive expert-knowledge and often converges to\nhighly exploitable policies. A recently proposed method, Deep CFR, applies deep\nlearning directly to CFR, allowing the agent to intrinsically abstract and\ngeneralize over the state-space from samples, without requiring expert\nknowledge. In this paper, we introduce Single Deep CFR (SD-CFR), a simplified\nvariant of Deep CFR that has a lower overall approximation error by avoiding\nthe training of an average strategy network. We show that SD-CFR is more\nattractive from a theoretical perspective and empirically outperforms Deep CFR\nwith respect to exploitability and one-on-one play in poker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 21:52:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2019 15:04:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 17:32:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2019 14:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-07"}

Since the first success in financial sector, blockchain has\nshown great potentials in various domains, e.g., internet of things and mobile\nnetworks. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based architecture for\ncontent delivery networks (B-CDN), which exploits the advances of the\nblockchain technology to provide a decentralized and secure platform to connect\ncontent providers (CPs) with users. On one hand, the proposed B-CDN will\nleverage the registration and subscription of the users to different CPs, while\nguaranteeing the user privacy thanks to virtual identity provided by the\nblockchain network. On the other hand, the B-CDN creates a public immutable\ndatabase of the requested contents (from all CPs), based on which each CP can\nbetter evaluate the user preference on its contents. The benefits of B-CDN are\ndemonstrated via an edge-caching application, in which a feature-based caching\nalgorithm is proposed for all CPs. The proposed caching algorithm is verified\nwith the realistic Movielens dataset. A win-win relation between the CPs and\nusers is observed, where the B-CDN improves user quality of experience and\nreduces cost of delivering content for the CPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 21:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-24"}

One suggested way to synthesize such a large amount of 56Ni is through\nenergetic core-collapse supernovae from very massive progenitors.

Here, models of\nboth PISNe and the explosion following the collapse of the core of a very\nmassive star (100 Msun) are used to compute nebular spectra, which are compared\nto the spectrum of the prototypical PISN candidate, SN 2007bi. PISN models are\nconfirmed to produce synthetic spectra showing narrow emission lines, resulting\nfrom the confinement of 56Ni to the lowest velocities (<~ 2000 km/s) and in\nclear disagreement with the spectrum of SN 2007bi. Spectra more closely\nresembling SN 2007bi are obtained if the PISN models are fully mixed in\nabundance. Massive core-collapse models produce enough 56Ni to power the light\ncurve of PISN candidates, but their spectra are also not adequate.

A major difference between PISN and\nmassive collapse models is that the former emit much more strongly in the NIR.\nIt is concluded that: a) current PISN candidates, in particular SN 2007bi, are\nmore likely the result of the collapse and explosion of massive stars below the\nPI limit; b) significant asymmetry is required to reproduce the late-time\nspectrum of SN 2007bi.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 22:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

Further, we extend this property of names to show how names can be\nused to detect other types of bias in the embeddings such as bias based on\nrace, ethnicity, and age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 00:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-24"}

Recently, the quantum contact process (QCP) was theoretically\ninvestigated using the Rydberg antiblockade effect, in particular, when the\nRydberg atoms were excited in s-states so that their interactions were regarded\nas being between the nearest neighbors. However, when the atoms are excited to\nd-states, the dipole-dipole interactions become effective, and long-range\ninteractions must be considered. Here, we consider a quantum spin model with a\nlong-range QCP, where the branching and coagulation processes are allowed not\nonly for the nearest-neighbor pairs, but also for long-distance pairs,\ncoherently and incoherently.

Note that activation maps by considering\ndifferent class pair are complementary, and therefore can provide more\ndiscriminative cues to overcome the shortcoming of the existing CAM generation\nthat the highlighted regions are usually local part regions rather than global\nobject regions due to the lack of object cues. In this paper, we generate CAM\nby using a few of representative classes, with aim of extracting more\ndiscriminative cues by considering each class pair to obtain CAM more globally.\nThe advantages are twofold. Firstly, the representative classes are able to\nobtain activation regions that are complementary to each other, and therefore\nleads to generating activation map more accurately. Secondly, we only need to\nconsider a small number of representative classes, making the CAM generation\nsuitable for small networks. We propose a clustering based method to select the\nrepresentative classes. Multiple binary classification models rather than a\nmultiple class classification model are used to generate the CAM. Moreover, we\npropose a multi-layer fusion based CAM generation method to simultaneously\ncombine high-level semantic features and low-level detail features.

Real data distributed in a high-dimensional space can be\ndisentangled into a union of low-dimensional subspaces, which can benefit\nvarious applications. To explore such intrinsic structure, state-of-the-art\nsubspace clustering approaches often optimize a self-representation problem\namong all samples, to construct a pairwise affinity graph for spectral\nclustering. However, a graph with pairwise similarities lacks robustness for\nsegmentation, especially for samples which lie on the intersection of two\nsubspaces. To address this problem, we design a hyper-correlation based data\nstructure termed as the \\textit{triplet relationship}, which reveals high\nrelevance and local compactness among three samples. The triplet relationship\ncan be derived from the self-representation matrix, and be utilized to\niteratively assign the data points to clusters. Three samples in each triplet\nare encouraged to be highly correlated and are considered as a meta-element\nduring clustering, which show more robustness than pairwise relationships when\nsegmenting two densely distributed subspaces. Based on the triplet\nrelationship, we propose a unified optimizing scheme to automatically calculate\nclustering assignments. Specifically, we optimize a model selection reward and\na fusion reward by simultaneously maximizing the similarity of triplets from\ndifferent clusters while minimizing the correlation of triplets from same\ncluster. The proposed algorithm also automatically reveals the number of\nclusters and fuses groups to avoid over-segmentation.

In the detection phase, raw\nsignals are split into frames and transformed into the wavelet domain. A Markov\nmodels-based naive Bayes approach is used to check for the presence of a UAV in\neach frame. In the classification phase, unlike the traditional approaches that\nrely solely on time-domain signals and corresponding features, the proposed\ntechnique uses the energy transient signal. This approach is more robust to\nnoise and can cope with different modulation techniques. First, the normalized\nenergy trajectory is generated from the energy-time-frequency distribution of\nthe raw control signal. Next, the start and end points of the energy transient\nare detected by searching for the most abrupt changes in the mean of the energy\ntrajectory. Then, a set of statistical features is extracted from the energy\ntransient. Significant features are selected by performing neighborhood\ncomponent analysis (NCA) to keep the computational cost of the algorithm low.\nFinally, selected features are fed to several machine learning algorithms for\nclassification. The algorithms are evaluated experimentally using a database\ncontaining 100 RF signals from each of 14 different UAV controllers. The\nsignals are recorded wirelessly using a high-frequency oscilloscope. The data\nset is randomly partitioned into training and test sets for validation with the\nratio 4:1. Ten Monte Carlo simulations are run and results are averaged to\nassess the performance of the methods. All the micro-UAVs are detected\ncorrectly and an average accuracy of 96.3% is achieved using the k-nearest\nneighbor (kNN) classification.

In this paper, we\npropose a joint group and residual sparse coding method for CS image recovery\n(JGRSC-CS). In the proposed JGRSC-CS, patch group is treated as the basic unit\nof sparse coding and two dictionaries (namely internal and external\ndictionaries) are applied to exploit the sparse representation of each group\nsimultaneously. The internal self-adaptive dictionary is used to remove\nartifacts, and an external Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) dictionary, learned\nfrom clean training images, is used to enhance details and texture. To make the\nproposed method effective and robust, the split Bregman method is adopted to\nreconstruct the whole image. Experimental results manifest the proposed\nJGRSC-CS algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both peak\nsignal to noise ratio (PSNR) and visual quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 04:36:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-24"}

However, isolation usually carries a price\nin terms of less resource sharing and reduced inter-process communication. In\nan open architecture such as Android, this price and its impact on performance,\nusability, and transparency must be carefully considered. Although previous\nefforts in developing general-purpose isolation solutions have shown that some\nof these negative side effects can be mitigated, doing so involves overcoming\nsignificant design challenges by incorporating numerous additional platform\ncomplexities not directly related to improved security. Thus, the general\npurpose solutions become inefficient and burdensome if the end-user has only\nspecific security goals. In this paper, we present PINPOINT, a resource\nisolation strategy that forgoes general-purpose solutions in favor of a\n\"building block\" approach that addresses specific end-user security goals.\nPINPOINT embodies the concept of Linux Namespace lightweight isolation, but\ndoes so in the Android Framework by guiding the security designer towards\nisolation points that are contextually close to the resource(s) that need to be\nisolated. This strategy allows the rest of the Framework to function fully as\nintended, transparently. We demonstrate our strategy with a case study on\nAndroid System Services, and show four applications of PINPOINTed system\nservices functioning with unmodified market apps. Our evaluation results show\nthat practical security and privacy advantages can be gained using our\napproach, without inducing the problematic side-effects that other\ngeneral-purpose designs must address.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 05:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-24"}

The\nconventional way of addressing this ill-posed inversion problem is through\niterative algorithms, which suffer from poor nonlinear mapping and strong\nnonuniqueness. Other attempts may either import human intervention errors or\nunderuse seismic data. The challenge for DNNs mainly lies in the weak spatial\ncorrespondence, the uncertain reflection-reception relationship between seismic\ndata and velocity model, as well as the time-varying property of seismic data.\nTo tackle these challenges, we propose end-to-end seismic inversion networks\n(SeisInvNets) with novel components to make the best use of all seismic data.\nSpecifically, we start with every seismic trace and enhance it with its\nneighborhood information, its observation setup, and the global context of its\ncorresponding seismic profile. From the enhanced seismic traces, the spatially\naligned feature maps can be learned and further concatenated to reconstruct a\nvelocity model. In general, we let every seismic trace contribute to the\nreconstruction of the whole velocity model by finding spatial correspondence.\nThe proposed SeisInvNet consistently produces improvements over the baselines\nand achieves promising performance on our synthesized and proposed SeisInv data\nset according to various evaluation metrics. The inversion results are more\nconsistent with the target from the aspects of velocity values, subsurface\nstructures, and geological interfaces. Moreover, the mechanism and the\ngeneralization of the proposed method are discussed and verified. Nevertheless,\nthe generalization of deep-learning-based inversion methods on real data is\nstill challenging and considering physics may be one potential solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 05:51:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 07:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-29"}

We use these new precise RM\nmeasurements (in combination with existing RMs, dispersion measures, and\ndistance estimates) to estimate the scale height of the Galactic halo magnetic\nfield: 2.0$\\pm$0.3 kpc for Galactic quadrants I and II above and below the\nGalactic plane (we also evaluate the scale height for these regions\nindividually).

First, we infer the EM distributions only from temperatures that\ncontribute to the same background emission. Second, we measure the background\nemission co-spatially with the loops so that the results are truly\nrepresentative of the immediate loop environment. The second aspect also allows\nus to take advantage of the presence of embedded loops to infer information\nabout the (unresolvable) magnetic field in the background. We find that about\nhalf the regions in our sample have narrow but not quite isothermal EM\ndistributions with a peak temperature of 1.4--2 MK.

Most of the existing action\nrecognition works hold the \\textit{closed-set} assumption that all action\ncategories are known beforehand while deep networks can be well trained for\nthese categories. However, action recognition in the real world is essentially\nan \\textit{open-set} problem, namely, it is impossible to know all action\ncategories beforehand and consequently infeasible to prepare sufficient\ntraining samples for those emerging categories. In this case, applying\nclosed-set recognition methods will definitely lead to unseen-category errors.\nTo address this challenge, we propose the Open Deep Network (ODN) for the\nopen-set action recognition task. Technologically, ODN detects new categories\nby applying a multi-class triplet thresholding method, and then dynamically\nreconstructs the classification layer and \"opens\" the deep network by adding\npredictors for new categories continually. In order to transfer the learned\nknowledge to the new category, two novel methods, Emphasis Initialization and\nAllometry Training, are adopted to initialize and incrementally train the new\npredictor so that only few samples are needed to fine-tune the model. Extensive\nexperiments show that ODN can effectively detect and recognize new categories\nwith little human intervention, thus applicable to the open-set action\nrecognition tasks in the real world.

For both of these\nsources, the mean electron distribution function as a function of time is\ndetermined over an energy range from 0.1~keV up to several tens of keV, for the\nfirst time.

The excellent\ntheoretical properties of EXP3, a leading multi-armed bandit algorithm, suggest\nthat it should work well for this type of problem. Yet, it performs poorly in\npractice. A major limitation is its slow rate of stabilization. Bandit-style\nalgorithms perform better when global knowledge is available, i.e., when\ndevices receive feedback about all networks after each selection. But,\nunfortunately, communicating full information to all devices is expensive.\nTherefore, we address the question of how much information is adequate to\nachieve better performance.

Here we present 24 years of archival\nradio observations (from the Very Large Array and the Very Long Baseline Array)\nof the black hole X-ray binary V404 Cygni in quiescence (totalling 150\nobservations from 1.4 -- 22 GHz).

As expected, the average radio spectrum is\nflat with a mean and standard deviation of (<alpha_r >, sigma_alpha_r)= (0.02,\n0.65) where f_nu \\propto nu^alpha_r. We find that radio flares that increase\nthe flux density by factors of 2 -- 4 over timescales as short as <10 min are\ncommonplace, and that long-term variations (over 10--4000 day timescales) are\nconsistent with shot noise impulses that decay to stochastic variations on\ntimescales <10 days (and perhaps as short as tens of minutes to several hours).\nWe briefly compare the variability characteristics of V404 Cygni to jetted\nactive galactic nuclei, and we conclude with recommendations on how to account\nfor variability when placing quiescent black hole X-ray binary candidates with\nradio luminosities comparable to V404 Cygni (L_r ~ 1e28 erg/s) onto the\nradio/X-ray luminosity plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 09:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

Then, we prove an information-theoretic\nconverse bound on the storage-communication (SC) tradeoff achieved by universal\ncomputing schemes with straggling nodes. We show that the information-theoretic\nbound matches the performance achieved by the coded computing schemes with\nstraggling nodes corresponding to the Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MAN) PDAs, i.e.,\nto the Comp-PDAs describing Maddah-Ali and Niesen's coded caching scheme.\nInterestingly, the same Comp-PDAs (the MAN-PDAs) are optimal for any number of\nstraggling nodes, which implies that the map phase of optimal coded computing\nschemes does not need to be adapted to the number of stragglers in the system.\nWe finally prove that while the points that lie exactly on the fundamental SC\ntradeoff cannot be achieved with Comp-PDAs that require smaller number of files\nthan the MAN-PDAs, this is possible for some of the points that lie close to\nthe SC tradeoff. For these latter points, the decrease in the requested number\nof files can be exponential in the number of nodes of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 09:48:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 10:39:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 22:44:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 02:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

In\naddition to the hot Fe complex at 6.7 keV, we observed fluorescent emission\nfrom Fe at $\\sim6.4$ keV, confirming the previous findings. The line at 6.4 keV\nis detected during quiescent and flaring states and its flux is variable. The\nequivalent width is found varying in the $\\approx 0.15--0.5$ keV range. These\nvalues make unrealistic a simple model with a centrally illuminated disk and\nsuggest a role of the cavity containing Elias 29 and possibly reverberation\nprocesses that could occur in it. We observed two flares, with duration of 20\nks and 50 ks, respectively. We systematically observed an increase of $N_H$\nduring the flares of a factor five. This behavior has been observed during\nflares previously detected in Elias 29 with XMM-Newton and ASCA. The phenomenon\nhints that the flaring regions could be buried under the accretion streams and\nat high stellar latitudes, as the X-rays from flares pass through gas denser\nthan the gas along the line of sight of the quiescent corona. In a different\nscenario, a contribution from scattered soft photons to the primary coronal\nemission could mimic a shallower $N_H$ in the quiescent spectrum. In the\nspectrum of the full NuSTAR exposure, we detect hard X-ray emission in the band\n$\\approx20-80$ keV in excess with respect to the thermal emission. The hard\nX-ray emission could be due to a population of energetic electrons accelerated\nby the magnetic field along the accretion streams.

The global dynamics is completely described,\nand it is proven that all feasible nontrivial solutions converge to the\npositive equilibrium. The main tools of the proof rely on persistence theory,\ncomparison principles and an $L^2$-perturbation technique. Using local\ninvariant manifolds, a unique heteroclinic orbit is constructed that connects\nthe unstable zero and the stable positive equilibrium, and we show that these\nthree complete orbits constitute the global attractor of the system. Despite\nglobal attractivity, the dynamics is not trivial as we can observe long-lasting\ntransient oscillatory patterns of various shapes.

To this end, the research of CNN compression has\nrecently become emerging. In this paper, we propose a novel filter pruning\nscheme, termed structured sparsity regularization (SSR), to simultaneously\nspeedup the computation and reduce the memory overhead of CNNs, which can be\nwell supported by various off-the-shelf deep learning libraries. Concretely,\nthe proposed scheme incorporates two different regularizers of structured\nsparsity into the original objective function of filter pruning, which fully\ncoordinates the global outputs and local pruning operations to adaptively prune\nfilters. We further propose an Alternative Updating with Lagrange Multipliers\n(AULM) scheme to efficiently solve its optimization. AULM follows the principle\nof ADMM and alternates between promoting the structured sparsity of CNNs and\noptimizing the recognition loss, which leads to a very efficient solver (2.5x\nto the most recent work that directly solves the group sparsity-based\nregularization). Moreover, by imposing the structured sparsity, the online\ninference is extremely memory-light, since the number of filters and the output\nfeature maps are simultaneously reduced. The proposed scheme has been deployed\nto a variety of state-of-the-art CNN structures including LeNet, AlexNet, VGG,\nResNet and GoogLeNet over different datasets. Quantitative results demonstrate\nthat the proposed scheme achieves superior performance over the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

The prevailing state-of-the-art\napproach for simulation is to use game engines or high-fidelity computer\ngraphics (CG) models to create driving scenarios. However, creating CG models\nand vehicle movements (e.g., the assets for simulation) remains a manual task\nthat can be costly and time-consuming. In addition, the fidelity of CG images\nstill lacks the richness and authenticity of real-world images and using these\nimages for training leads to degraded performance.\n  In this paper we present a novel approach to address these issues: Augmented\nAutonomous Driving Simulation (AADS). Our formulation augments real-world\npictures with a simulated traffic flow to create photo-realistic simulation\nimages and renderings. More specifically, we use LiDAR and cameras to scan\nstreet scenes. From the acquired trajectory data, we generate highly plausible\ntraffic flows for cars and pedestrians and compose them into the background.\nThe composite images can be re-synthesized with different viewpoints and sensor\nmodels. The resulting images are photo-realistic, fully annotated, and ready\nfor end-to-end training and testing of autonomous driving systems from\nperception to planning. We explain our system design and validate our\nalgorithms with a number of autonomous driving tasks from detection to\nsegmentation and predictions.\n  Compared to traditional approaches, our method offers unmatched scalability\nand realism. Scalability is particularly important for AD simulation and we\nbelieve the complexity and diversity of the real world cannot be realistically\ncaptured in a virtual environment.

This approach is inspired by a famous result due to\nKhintchine from Diophantine approximation. This result shows that for a family\nof limsup sets, their Lebesgue measure is determined by the convergence or\ndivergence of naturally occurring volume sums. For many parameterised families\nof overlapping iterated function systems, we prove that a typical member will\nexhibit similar Khintchine like behaviour. Families of iterated function\nsystems our results apply to include those arising from Bernoulli convolutions,\nthe $\\{0,1,3\\}$ problem, and affine contractions with varying translation\nparameter. As a by-product of our analysis we obtain new proofs of well known\nresults due to Solomyak on the absolute continuity of Bernoulli convolutions,\nand when the attractor in the $\\{0,1,3\\}$ problem has positive Lebesgue\nmeasure.\n  For each $t\\in [0,1]$ we let $\\Phi_t$ be the iterated function system given\nby\n$$\\Phi_{t}:=\\Big\\{\\phi_1(x)=\\frac{x}{2},\\phi_2(x)=\\frac{x+1}{2},\\phi_3(x)=\\frac{x+t}{2},\\phi_{4}(x)=\\frac{x+1+t}{2}\\Big\\}.$$\nWe include a detailed study of this family. We prove that either $\\Phi_t$\ncontains an exact overlap, or we observe Khintchine like behaviour. Our\nanalysis of this family shows that by studying the metric properties of limsup\nsets, we can distinguish between the overlapping behaviour of iterated function\nsystems in a way that is not available to us by simply studying properties of\nself-similar measures.\n  Last of all, we introduce a property of an iterated function system that we\ncall being consistently separated with respect to a measure.

The NLS1 is relatively quiescent for the first ~120 ks of the\nobservation before it flares in brightness by a factor of about five in the\nlast 20 ks. Although only part of the flare is captured before the observation\nis terminated, the data reveal significant differences between the flare and\nquiescent phases. During the low-flux state, Mrk 335 demonstrates a\nreflection-dominated spectrum that results from a compact corona around a Kerr\nblack hole. In addition to the rapid brightening, the flare is further\ndescribed by spectral softening and a falling reflection fraction that are\nconsistent with previous observations advocating at least part of the corona in\nMrk 335 could be the base of an aborted jet. The spectrum during the flaring\ninterval reveals several residuals between the 2-3 sigma level that could be\nattributed to absorption lines from a highly ionised plasma that is moving\noutward at v~0.12c.

Furthermore, different metrics are used on the\nprovided expressions in order to evaluate the suitability of the considered PLC\npulses for providing proper TDR measurements, i.e., \\textit{reflectograms}, in\nterms of resolution, effectiveness of the pulse compression, distortion, and\nrange. Considering the scenarios of European underground low-voltage and US\noverhead medium-voltage power distribution networks, we finally carry out a\ncomparative numerical analysis among the considered PLC pulses in terms of the\naforementioned metrics for frequency bands comprising narrowband- and\nbroadband-PLC, with a highlight on compliance to regulatory constraints. Based\non the achieved results, we show that the use of UWB pulses allows the\nobtaining of a larger number of reflectograms in a given time interval, while\nHS-OFDM and CSS pulses provide higher reflectogram quality and better\nresolution for a given occupied frequency bandwidth. Also, we show that NB-PLC\npulses are suitable for most distribution network scenarios, being the use of\nBB-PLC left for cases where very fine resolutions are desired.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 14:43:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-24"}

We aim to\nshow that when the user preferences are sufficiently diverse and each arm can\nbe optimal for certain users, the O(log T) regret incurred by exploring the\nsub-optimal arms under the standard stochastic MAB setting can be reduced to a\nconstant. Our intuition is that to achieve sub-linear regret, the number of\ntimes an optimal arm being pulled should scale linearly in time; when all arms\nare optimal for certain users and pulled frequently, the estimated arm\nstatistics can quickly converge to their true values, thus reducing the need of\nexploration dramatically. We cast the problem into a stochastic linear bandits\nmodel, where both the users preferences and the state of arms are modeled as\n{independent and identical distributed (i.i.d)} d-dimensional random vectors.\nAfter receiving the user preference vector at the beginning of each time slot,\nthe learner pulls an arm and receives a reward as the linear product of the\npreference vector and the arm state vector. We also assume that the state of\nthe pulled arm is revealed to the learner once its pulled. We propose a\nWeighted Upper Confidence Bound (W-UCB) algorithm and show that it can achieve\na constant regret when the user preferences are sufficiently diverse.

The capacitance diverges as the\npotential values at which the electric field tends to zero and attains negative\nvalues in regions of the surface potentials depending on their polarity and\nvalues of the surface crystal potential. Negative values of the capacitance may\nindicate the thermodynamic instability of the system that can result from\nneglecting the short range interaction contribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 15:13:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-24"}

They are markers of\ninequality at the population level and express the uncertainty at the time of\ndeath at the individual level. In particular, Keyfitz' entropy $\\bar{H}$\nrepresents the elasticity of life expectancy to a change in mortality and it\nhas been used as an indicator of lifespan variation. However, it is unknown how\nthis measure changes over time and whether a threshold age exists, as it does\nfor other lifespan variation indicators.\n  RESULTS The time derivative of $\\bar{H}$ can be decomposed into changes in\nlife disparity $e^\\dagger$ and life expectancy at birth $e_o$. Likewise,\nchanges over time in $\\bar{H}$ are a weighted average of age-specific rates of\nmortality improvements. These weights reflect the sensitivity of $\\bar{H}$ and\nshow how mortality improvements can increase (or decrease) the relative\ninequality of lifespans. Further, we prove that $\\bar{H}$, as well as\n$e^\\dagger$, in the case that mortality is reduced in every age, has a\nthreshold age below which saving lives reduces entropy, whereas improvements\nabove that age increase entropy.\n  CONTRIBUTION We give a formal expression for changes over time of $\\bar{H}$\nand provide a formal proof of the threshold age that separates reductions and\nincreases in lifespan inequality from age-specific mortality improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 15:48:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-24"}

Although there have been several\ninteresting suggestions, the question remains open. In this paper, I consider a\nnatural choice for the universal quantum state arising from the Past\nHypothesis, a boundary condition that accounts for the time-asymmetry of the\nuniverse. The natural choice is given not by a wave function (representing a\npure state) but by a density matrix (representing a mixed state).\n  I begin by classifying quantum theories into two types: theories with a\nfundamental wave function and theories with a fundamental density matrix. The\nPast Hypothesis is compatible with infinitely many initial wave functions, none\nof which seems to be particularly natural. However, once we turn to density\nmatrices, the Past Hypothesis provides a natural choice---the normalized\nprojection onto the Past Hypothesis subspace in the Hilbert space.\nNevertheless, the two types of theories can be empirically equivalent. To\nprovide a concrete understanding of the empirical equivalence, I provide a\nnovel subsystem analysis in the context of Bohmian theories.

We adopt the recent approach of\nresource theories, where one studies the transitions between states that can be\naccomplished with a restricted set of physical operations. We formulate three\ndifferent resource theories, differing in the choice of the restricted set of\nphysical operations. To bridge the gap between the objective dynamics of\nparticles and the subjective world of probabilities, one of the core issues in\nthe foundations of statistical mechanics, we propose four information-theoretic\naxioms.

The axioms identify a class\nof theories where every mixed state can be modelled as the reduced state of a\npure entangled state. In these theories it is possible to introduce\nwell-behaved notions of majorisation, entropy, and Gibbs states, allowing for\nan information-theoretic derivation of Landauer's principle.

An\narticle in Scientific American entitled \"The Sun Is Spitting Out Strange\nPatterns of Gamma Rays-and No One Knows Why\" is a discussion of Linden's paper.\nIt may be summarized as follows: The Sun has been observed to be emitting gamma\nray bursts. The weaker gamma rays tend to be less than 50 GeV, emitted during\nthe most active energetic period of the solar cycle and towards the poles. The\ngamma-ray emission is most intense during Solar Minimum, reaching >100 GeV and\nthose emissions are near the equator: \"Most strikingly, although 6 gamma rays\nabove 100 GeV are observed during the 1.4 years of solar minimum, none are\nobserved during the next 7.8 years (Linden, et al., 2018).\" Pease and Glenn, in\nthe conclusion of a recent paper, suggested that solar cycles are regulated by\nplanetary orbital positions, influencing the Sun through transfer of\ngravitational or electromagnetic forces, or both (Pease & Glenn, 2016). This\npaper will describe a working hypothesis that points strongly to\nelectromagnetic connections between Jupiter, Saturn, and the Sun during Solar\nMinimum which contribute to the high gamma-ray energy observed being emitted by\nthe Sun. The hypothesis further suggests that the electromagnetic connections\nbetween the Sun and Jupiter, Saturn, and other planets with magnetospheres,\nnamely Neptune, Earth, and Uranus, are responsible over billions of years for\nmodulating a dual electromagnetic field resonance internal to the Sun. These\nmajor periodic cycles are known as the 11-year Schwabe and 22-year Hale solar\ncycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 17:52:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Feb 2019 20:18:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-11"}

In this paper, we study smart\nthermostats for refrigerant leakage detection. Retail outlets, such as\nmilk-booths and quick service restaurants set up cold-rooms to store perishable\nitems. In each room, a refrigeration unit (akin to air-conditioners) is used to\nmaintain a suitable temperature for the stored products. Often, refrigerant\nleaks through the coils (or valves) of the refrigeration unit which slowly\ndiminishes the cooling capacity of the refrigeration unit while allowing it to\nbe functional. Such leaks waste significant energy, risk occupants' health, and\nimpact the quality of stored perishable products. While store managers usually\nfail to sense the early symptoms of such leaks, current techniques to report\nrefrigerant leakage are often not scalable. We propose Greina - to continuously\nmonitor the readily available ambient information from the thermostat and\ntimely report such leaks. We evaluate our approach on 74 outlets of a retail\nenterprise and results indicate that Greina can report the leakage a week in\nadvance when compared to manual reporting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 21:18:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-31"}

Many industry reports, as well as research papers,\nhave already highlighted the crucial role that storage systems have in the\ncoming years in the electricity sector, especially when combined with renewable\nenergy systems (RES). Given the high cost of storage technologies, there is an\nurgent need for optimizing such integrated energy systems. In this paper, a\nsimulation-based method is adopted and improved, in order to compare different\nbattery types based on their characteristics by considering projected trends in\nthe future. After the introduction of four different battery types, i.e.\nlead-acid, sodium sulphur, vanadium redox and lithium-ion, the mathematical\nmodel for the optimization problem is presented, along with the required\nexplanations. Subsequently, a case study is described and the numerical\nassumptions are defined. Therein, our specific focus addresses the different\nvalues that the four battery types possess in three critical parameters, i.e.\nbattery cost, efficiency and depth of discharge (DoD). Finally, results and\ndiscussion are provided in an illustrative and informative way.
