By jointly optimizing energy and information\nbeamforming designs at the F-HAP, the bandwidth allocation and the computation\noffloading distribution, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the\nrequired energy under communication and computation requirements, as well as\nenergy harvesting constraints. Two optimal designs, i.e., fixed offloading time\n(FOT) and optimized offloading time (OOT) designs, are proposed. As both\ndesigns get involved in solving non-convex problems, there are no known\nsolutions to them. Therefore, for the FOT design, the semidefinite relaxation\n(SDR) is adopted to solve it. It is theoretically proved that the rank-one\nconstraints are always satisfied, so the global optimal solution is guaranteed.\nFor the OOT design, since its non-convexity is hard to deal with, a penalty\ndual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is proposed, which is able to achieve\na suboptimal solution. The computational complexity for two designs are\nanalyzed. Numerical results show that the partial offloading mode is superior\nto binary benchmark modes.

As part of our\nstudy, we drastically boost the performance of previously proposed techniques\nand outperform previously published state-of-the-art results by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 18:08:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-28"}

Further assume that their ranking is a total\norder and thus satisfies transitivity and anti-symmetry. Following Frances Yao\n(1974), an element (player) is said to be $(i,j)$-\\emph{mediocre} if it is\nneither among the top $i$ nor among the bottom $j$ elements of $S$. Finding a\nmediocre element is closely related to finding the median element. More than\n$40$ years ago, Yao suggested a very simple and elegant algorithm for finding\nan $(i,j)$-mediocre element: Pick $i+j+1$ elements arbitrarily and select the\n$(i+1)$-th largest among them. She also asked: \"Is this the best algorithm?\" No\none seems to have found a better algorithm ever since. We first provide a\ndeterministic algorithm that beats the worst-case comparison bound in Yao's\nalgorithm for a large range of values of $i$ (and corresponding suitable\n$j=j(i)$) even if the current best selection algorithm is used. We then repeat\nthe exercise for randomized algorithms; the average number of comparisons of\nour algorithm beats the average comparison bound in Yao's algorithm for another\nlarge range of values of $i$ (and corresponding suitable $j=j(i)$) even if the\nbest selection algorithm is used; the improvement is most notable in the\nsymmetric case $i=j$. Moreover, the tight bound obtained in the analysis of\nYao's algorithm allows us to give a definite answer for this class of\nalgorithms. In summary, we answer Yao's question as follows: (i)~\"Presently\nnot\" for deterministic algorithms and (ii)~\"Definitely not\" for randomized\nalgorithms.

In contrast to previous works that tie galaxy properties to halo\nconcentration and halo formation redshift, we focus on halo growth rate as a\nmeasure of assembly history. We find that, at fixed halo mass, faster growing\nhalos tend to have lower stellar masses and higher SFRs per unit stellar mass\nbut similar overall SFRs. We provide a simple explanation for these findings\nwith the help of an analytic model that captures approximately the behavior of\nour hydrodynamical simulations. Specifically, among halos of a given current\nmass, quickly growing halos have lower stellar masses (and thus higher sSFRs)\nbecause they were less massive and had comparably lower cold gas masses and\nSFRs in the past than slowly growing halos. By combining these findings with\nestimates for the scatter of the halo growth rate, we show that variations in\ngrowth rate at fixed halo mass may largely explain the scatter of the stellar\nmass - halo mass relation. In contrast, halo growth variations likely play only\na minor role in the scatter of the star forming sequence in low mass galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

The gold standard for\nlearning in recurrent neural networks in machine learning is back-propagation\nthrough time (BPTT), which implements stochastic gradient descent with regard\nto a given loss function.

We show that an\nonline merging of locally available information during a computation with\nsuitable top-down learning signals in real-time provides highly capable\napproximations to BPTT. For tasks where information on errors arises only late\nduring a network computation, we enrich locally available information through\nfeedforward eligibility traces of synapses that can easily be computed in an\nonline manner.

In\nparticular the convex hull of any isometric cycle of such a graph is a gated\nquasi-hypertori (i.e., the Cartesian product of copies of K_2 and even cycles).\nMoreover, for any Peano partial cubes G that contains no isometric rays, there\nexists a finite qasi-hypertorus which is fixed by all automorphisms of G, and\nany self-contraction of G fixes some finite quasi-hypertorus.

The\ndevelopment starts with revealing the relation between the area of a surface\nelement in the Euclidean or Riemannian metric and the Jacobian matrix of the\ncorresponding affine mapping, formulating the equidistribution and alignment\nconditions for surface meshes, and establishing a meshing energy function based\non the conditions. The moving mesh equation is then defined as the gradient\nsystem of the energy function, with the nodal mesh velocities being projected\nonto the underlying surface. The analytical expression for the mesh velocities\nis obtained in a compact, matrix form, which makes the implementation of the\nnew method on a computer relatively easy and robust. Moreover, it is\nanalytically shown that any mesh trajectory generated by the method remains\nnonsingular if it is so initially. It is emphasized that the method is\ndeveloped directly on surface meshes, making no use of any information on\nsurface parameterization. It utilizes surface normal vectors to ensure that the\nmesh vertices remain on the surface while moving, and also assumes that the\ninitial surface mesh is given. The new method can apply to general surfaces\nwith or without explicit parameterization since the surface normal vectors can\nbe computed even when the surface only has a numerical representation. A\nselection of two- and three-dimensional examples are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 20:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20"}

Construction sites are abundant in already\ndense cities and have unavoidable impacts on surrounding environments and\nresidents. However, such impacts were rarely quantified and made available to\nconstruction teams and local agencies to inform their planning decisions. A\nchallenge in achieving this was the lack of availability of data that can\nprovide insights about how urban residents respond to changes in their\nenvironment due to construction projects. Wider availability of data from city\nagencies nowadays provides opportunities for having such analysis possible.\nThis paper provides the details of a generic data-driven approach that enables\nthe analysis of impact of construction projects on quality of life in urban\nsettings through the quantification of change on widely accepted quality of\nlife indicators in cities. This paper also evaluated the approach using data\nfrom publicly construction projects' information and open city data portals\nfrom New York City. Historical 311 Service Requests along with 27 road\nreconstruction projects were used as testbeds. The results showed that 61% of\nthe projects analyzed in this testbed experienced higher 311 requests after the\ncommencement of construction, with main complaints of 'noise', 'air quality',\nand 'sewer' at the beginning of construction, and 'sanitation' and 'waste'\ntowards the end. Prediction models, built using regression machine learning\nalgorithms, achieved an R-Squared value of 0.67.

Researchers have exploited DL to automate several development and\nmaintenance tasks, such as writing commit messages, generating comments and\ndetecting vulnerabilities among others. One of the long lasting dreams of\napplying DL to source code is the possibility to automate non-trivial coding\nactivities. While some steps in this direction have been taken (e.g., learning\nhow to fix bugs), there is still a glaring lack of empirical evidence on the\ntypes of code changes that can be learned and automatically applied by DL. Our\ngoal is to make this first important step by quantitatively and qualitatively\ninvestigating the ability of a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to learn\nhow to automatically apply code changes implemented by developers during pull\nrequests. We train and experiment with the NMT model on a set of 236k pairs of\ncode components before and after the implementation of the changes provided in\nthe pull requests. We show that, when applied in a narrow enough context (i.e.,\nsmall/medium-sized pairs of methods before/after the pull request changes), NMT\ncan automatically replicate the changes implemented by developers during pull\nrequests in up to 36% of the cases. Moreover, our qualitative analysis shows\nthat the model is capable of learning and replicating a wide variety of\nmeaningful code changes, especially refactorings and bug-fixing activities. Our\nresults pave the way for novel research in the area of DL on code, such as the\nautomatic learning and applications of refactoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 22:12:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

A many-body pd-band Hamiltonian is considered which takes\ninto account hybridizations, Coulomb interactions, spin-orbit interactions and\nthe coupling to the laser field on the same electronic level. In this way, a\nfruitful connection is established between the non-adiabatic quantum dynamics\nand the well-known equilibrium statistical mechanics of itinerant-electron\nferromagnets. The time evolution during and after the pulse absorption is\ndetermined exactly by performing numerical Lanczos propagations on a small\ncluster model with parameters appropriate for Ni. The most relevant laser\nparameters, namely, the fluence, wave length, polarization and pulse duration\nare varied systematically. The results show how they allow one to control the\ntotal absorbed energy, the spectral distribution of the initial excitation, and\nthe subsequent magnetization dynamics. The calculations show that reasonable\nchanges in these parameters do not affect the UFD dynamics qualitatively and\nhave only a minor influence on the time scale which characterizes the initial\ndemagnetization. In contrast, our model predicts that the degree of\ndemagnetization correlates well with the average number of electrons excited by\nthe laser or average number of absorbed photons.

A Lagrange formalism is used to construct adjoint conditions that\nare linear and homogenous in the unknown Lagrange multipliers. As a\nconsequence, it is shown how critical points on the constraint manifold can be\nfound through several stages of continuation along a sequence of connected\none-dimensional manifolds of solutions to increasing subsets of the necessary\noptimality conditions. Due to the presence of delayed and advanced arguments in\nthe original and adjoint differential equations, care must be taken to\ndetermine the degree of smoothness of the Lagrange multipliers with respect to\ntime. Such considerations naturally lead to a formulation in terms of\nmulti-segment boundary-value problems (BVPs), including the possibility that\nthe number of segments may change, or that their order may permute, during\ncontinuation. The methodology is illustrated using the software package coco on\nperiodic orbits of both linear and nonlinear delay-differential equations,\nkeeping in mind that closed-form solutions are not typically available even in\nthe linear case. Finally, we demonstrate optimization on a family of\nquasiperiodic invariant tori in an example unfolding of a Hopf bifurcation with\ndelay and parametric forcing.

Today's DNNs are\nbecoming deeper and wider because of increasing demand on the analysis quality\nand more and more complex applications to resolve. The wide and deep DNNs,\nhowever, require large amounts of resources, significantly restricting their\nutilization on resource-constrained systems. Although some network\nsimplification methods have been proposed to address this issue, they suffer\nfrom either low compression ratios or high compression errors, which may\nintroduce a costly retraining process for the target accuracy. In this paper,\nwe propose DeepSZ: an accuracy-loss bounded neural network compression\nframework, which involves four key steps: network pruning, error bound\nassessment, optimization for error bound configuration, and compressed model\ngeneration, featuring a high compression ratio and low encoding time. The\ncontribution is three-fold. (1) We develop an adaptive approach to select the\nfeasible error bounds for each layer. (2) We build a model to estimate the\noverall loss of accuracy based on the accuracy degradation caused by individual\ndecompressed layers. (3) We develop an efficient optimization algorithm to\ndetermine the best-fit configuration of error bounds in order to maximize the\ncompression ratio under the user-set accuracy constraint.

What formal\nexpressions state intuitively about the domain of discourse is studied in the\ntheory of the informal semantics of a logic. In this paper we study the\ninformal semantics of Answer Set Programming. The roots of answer set\nprogramming lie in the language of Extended Logic Programming, which was\nintroduced initially as an epistemic logic for default and autoepistemic\nreasoning. In 1999, the seminal papers on answer set programming proposed to\nuse this logic for a different purpose, namely, to model and solve search\nproblems. Currently, the language is used primarily in this new role. However,\nthe original epistemic intuitions lose their explanatory relevance in this new\ncontext. How answer set programs are connected to the specifications of\nproblems they model is more easily explained in a classical Tarskian semantics,\nin which models correspond to possible worlds, rather than to belief states of\nan epistemic agent. In this paper, we develop a new theory of the informal\nsemantics of answer set programming, which is formulated in the Tarskian\nsetting and based on Frege's compositionality principle. It differs\nsubstantially from the earlier epistemic theory of informal semantics,\nproviding a different view on the meaning of the connectives in answer set\nprogramming and on its relation to other logics, in particular classical logic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2019 00:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

That is, a\ncustomer committing to a flexible contract reveals valuable information about\nits future demand to the supplier. Such information revelation allows the\ncustomers and the supplier to share the risk of future demand uncertainty. On\nthe other hand, the customer will still retain its autonomy in operation.

The first is context-aware\nsemantic coherence which ensures that the OOI are placed around semantically\ncoherent regions within the background image. The second is harmonious\nappearance adaptation which ensures that the embedded OOI are agreeable to the\nsurrounding background from both geometry alignment and appearance realism. The\nproposed technique has been evaluated over two related but very different\ncomputer vision challenges, namely, scene text detection and scene text\nrecognition. Experiments over a number of public datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed image synthesis technique - the use of our\nsynthesized images in deep network training is capable of achieving similar or\neven better scene text detection and scene text recognition performance as\ncompared with using real images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2019 10:15:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2022 17:47:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 12:35:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-25"}

However, abundance\ndetermination by using conventional model atmospheres may not necessarily be\ncorrect since the existence of high-temperature chromosphere even in very old\nstars has been confirmed. The aim of this study is to examine how the extra UV\nflux possibly irradiated from the chromosphere could affect the formation of\nthe Li I 6708 line, and whether or not its influence might lead to a solution\nof the Li abundance discrepancy. A simple model chromosphere of a uniform thin\ngray slab emitting only thermal radiation is assumed, characterized by optical\nthickness and temperature. By taking into account this incident radiation in\nthe surface boundary condition, non-LTE calculations for Li are carried out to\nsee how the equivalent widths and the abundances are affected by these\nparameters. If the parameters are appropriately chosen, the strength of the Li\nI 6708 line can be reduced by a factor of ~2-3 due to overionization caused by\nenhanced UV radiation, leading to a lowering of the abundance by ~0.3-0.5 dex,\nwhich is consistent with the discrepancy in question. Moreover, the observed\nslight metallicity-dependent trend of the plateau can also be reproduced. Thus,\nsuperficial underestimation of Li abundances due to considerable overionization\ncaused by chromospheric radiation may be regarded as a ponderable\ninterpretation for the cosmological Li problem. The touchstone to verify this\nmodel would be to check the existence of significantly enhanced UV radiation in\nthese Spite plateau stars, which should be detected if this scenario is valid,\nalthough very few such UV spectrophotometric observations have been done to\ndate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2019 15:08:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-06"}

Due to EH, some\nwaiting time is required at the sensor before transmitting the status update.\nTo find the optimal transmission policy, an optimization problem is formulated\nto minimize the long-term average U-AoI under constraint of energy causality.\nAs the problem is non-convex and with no known solution, a two-layer algorithm\nis presented to solve it, where the outer loop is designed based on\nDinklebach's method, and in the inner loop, a semi-closed-form expression of\nthe optimal waiting time policy is derived based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)\noptimality conditions.
