Consider a\nconcurrent system with $n$ threads and $m$ objects. For such systems, either a\nvector clock of size $n$ is used with one component per thread or a vector\nclock of size $m$ is used with one component per object. A natural question is\nwhether one can use a vector clock of size strictly less than the minimum of\n$m$ and $n$ to timestamp events. We give an algorithm in this paper that uses a\nhybrid of thread and object components. Our algorithm is guaranteed to return\nthe minimum number of components necessary for vector clocks. We first consider\nthe case when the interaction between objects and threads is statically known.\nThis interaction is modeled by a thread-object bipartite graph. Our algorithm\nis based on finding the maximum bipartite matching of such a graph and then\napplying K\\\"{o}nig-Egerv\\'{a}ry Theorem to compute the minimum vertex cover to\ndetermine the optimal number of components necessary for the vector clock. We\nalso propose two mechanisms to compute such an vector clock when computation is\nrevealed in an online fashion. Evaluation on different types of graphs\nindicates that our offline algorithm generates a size vector clock which is\nsignificantly less than the minimum of $m$ and $n$. These mechanisms are more\neffective when the underlying bipartite graph is not dense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2019 16:08:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

In recent times, new levels of\nrealism have been achieved by advances in GAN training procedures and\narchitectures. These successful models, however, are tuned mostly for use with\nregularly sampled data such as images, audio and video. Despite the successful\napplication of the architecture on these types of media, applying the same\ntools to geometric data poses a far greater challenge. The study of geometric\ndeep learning is still a debated issue within the academic community as the\nlack of intrinsic parametrization inherent to geometric objects prohibits the\ndirect use of convolutional filters, a main building block of today's machine\nlearning systems. In this paper we propose a new method for generating\nrealistic human facial geometries coupled with overlayed textures. We\ncircumvent the parametrization issue by imposing a global mapping from our data\nto the unit rectangle. We further discuss how to design such a mapping to\ncontrol the mapping distortion and conserve area within the mapped image. By\nrepresenting geometric textures and geometries as images, we are able to use\nadvanced GAN methodologies to generate new geometries. We address the often\nneglected topic of relation between texture and geometry and propose to use\nthis correlation to match between generated textures and their corresponding\ngeometries. We offer a new method for training GAN models on partially\ncorrupted data. Finally, we provide empirical evidence demonstrating our\ngenerative model's ability to produce examples of new identities independent\nfrom the training data while maintaining a high level of realism, two traits\nthat are often at odds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2019 16:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

Performance on WM tasks is thought to be supported by the\nfrontoparietal system (FPS), the default mode system (DMS), and interactions\nbetween them. Yet little is known about how these systems and their\ninteractions relate to individual differences in WM performance. We address\nthis gap in knowledge using functional MRI data acquired during the performance\nof a 2-back WM task, as well as diffusion tensor imaging data collected in the\nsame individuals. We show that the strength of functional interactions between\nthe FPS and DMS during task engagement is inversely correlated with WM\nperformance, and that this strength is modulated by the activation of FPS\nregions but not DMS regions. Next, we use a clustering algorithm to identify\ntwo distinct subnetworks of the FPS, and find that these subnetworks display\ndistinguishable patterns of gene expression. Activity in one subnetwork is\npositively associated with the strength of FPS-DMS functional interactions,\nwhile activity in the second subnetwork is negatively associated. Further, the\npattern of structural linkages of these subnetworks explains their differential\ncapacity to influence the strength of FPS-DMS functional interactions. To\ndetermine whether these observations could provide a mechanistic account of\nlarge-scale neural underpinnings of WM, we build a computational model of the\nsystem composed of coupled oscillators. Modulating the amplitude of the\nsubnetworks in the model causes the expected change in the strength of FPS-DMS\nfunctional interactions, thereby offering support for a mechanism in which\nsubnetwork activity tunes functional interactions. Broadly, our study presents\na holistic account of how regional activity, functional interactions, and\nstructural linkages together support individual differences in WM in humans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2019 16:41:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

As they are being used in\ncritical applications, understanding underlying mechanisms for their successes\nand limitations is imperative. In this paper, we show that overfitting, one of\nthe fundamental issues in deep neural networks, is due to continuous gradient\nupdating and scale sensitiveness of cross entropy loss. By separating samples\ninto correctly and incorrectly classified ones, we show that they behave very\ndifferently, where the loss decreases in the correct ones and increases in the\nincorrect ones. Furthermore, by analyzing dynamics during training, we propose\na consensus-based classification algorithm that enables us to avoid overfitting\nand significantly improve the classification accuracy especially when the\nnumber of training samples is limited. As each trained neural network depends\non extrinsic factors such as initial values as well as training data, requiring\nconsensus among multiple models reduces extrinsic factors substantially; for\nstatistically independent models, the reduction is exponential. Compared to\nensemble algorithms, the proposed algorithm avoids overgeneralization by not\nclassifying ambiguous inputs. Systematic experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm. For example, using only 1000 training\nsamples from MNIST dataset, the proposed algorithm achieves 95% accuracy,\nsignificantly higher than any of the individual models, with 90% of the test\nsamples classified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2019 18:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

We design a novel efficient non-bottleneck\nlayer and a family of decoders which fit into a small run-time budget using\nVGG10 as efficient encoder. We demonstrate in our dataset that experimentation\nwith various design choices led to an improvement of 10\\% from a baseline\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2019 19:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

In this context, resonant inelastic\nX-ray scattering (RIXS) has recently risen to becoming a versatile probe of\nelectronic excitations in strongly correlated electron systems. The nature of\nthe radiation-matter interaction endows RIXS with the ability to resolve the\ncharge, spin and orbital nature of individual excitations. However, this\ncapability has been only marginally explored to date. Here, we demonstrate a\nsystematic method for the extraction of the character of excitations as\nimprinted in the azimuthal dependence of the RIXS signal. Using this novel\napproach, we resolve the charge, spin, and orbital nature of elastic\nscattering, (para-)magnon/bimagnon modes, and higher energy dd excitations in\nmagnetically-ordered and superconducting copper-oxide perovskites (Nd2CuO4 and\nYBa2Cu3O6.75). Our method derives from a direct application of scattering\ntheory, enabling us to deconstruct the complex scattering tensor as a function\nof energy loss. In particular, we use the characteristic tensorial nature of\neach excitation to precisely and reliably disentangle the charge and spin\ncontributions to the low energy RIXS spectrum. This procedure enables to\nseparately track the evolution of spin and charge spectral distributions in\ncuprates with doping. Our results demonstrate a new capability that can be\nintegrated into the RIXS toolset, and that promises to be widely applicable to\nmaterials with intertwined spin, orbital, and charge excitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2019 20:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

Recent developments include the Rodgers and Tao proof of\nthe 1976 conjecture that $\\Lambda_{DN} \\geq 0$ (that RH, if true, is only\nbarely so) and the Polymath 15 project improving the $1/2$ upper bound to about\n$0.22$. We also present examples of $\\rho$'s with differing $H_{\\rho,\\lambda}$\nand $\\Lambda_{DN} (\\rho)$ behaviors; some of these are new and based on a\nrecent weak convergence theorem of the authors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2019 22:19:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 23:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-15"}

Estimating the amount of collaboration in a network corresponding to\nconnections in a learning environment can reveal to what extent learners share\ntheir experience and knowledge with other learners. Alternatively, analyzing\nthe network of interactions in an open source software project can manifest\nindicators showing the efficiency of collaborations. One central problem in\nsuch domains is the low cooperativity values of networks due to the low\ncooperativity values of their respective communities. So administrators should\nnot only understand and predict the cooperativity of networks but also they\nneed to evaluate their respective community structures. To approach this issue,\nin this paper, we address two domains of open source software projects and\nlearning forums. As such, we calculate the amount of cooperativity in the\ncorresponding networks and communities of these domains by applying several\ncommunity detection algorithms. Moreover, we investigated the community\nproperties and identified the significant properties for estimating the network\nand community cooperativity. Correspondingly, we identified to what extent\nvarious community detection algorithms affect the identification of significant\nproperties and prediction of cooperativity.

Moreover, given side information that correlates to\ncertain trend in morphological change, a latent variable model can be\nregularized such that its latent representation reflects this side information.\nIn this work, we use the Wasserstein Auto-encoder to model this pathology\ncontinuum, and apply the Hilbert-Schmitt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to\nenforce dependency between certain latent features and the provided side\ninformation. We experimentally show that the model can provide disentangled and\ninterpretable latent representations and also generate a continuum of\nmorphological changes that corresponds to change in the side information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jan 2019 03:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

Lastly, numerical\nsimulations are provided to verify the analytical results and show that: 1)\nTWR-NOMA is superior to TWR-OMA in terms of outage probability in low SNR\nregimes; 2) Due to the impact of interference signal (IS) at the relay, error\nfloors and throughput ceilings exist in outage probabilities and ergodic rates\nfor TWR-NOMA, respectively; and 3) In delay-limited transmission mode, TWR-NOMA\nwith ipSIC and pSIC have almost the same energy efficiency.

Employing a comprehensive three-dimensional solution technique, the\nnon-Newtonian shearing response of the bulk emulsion is analyzed in the dilute\nsuspension regime. The present results reveal that the surfactant\nnon-uniformity creates significant alterations in the flow disturbance around\nthe drop, thereby influencing the viscous dissipation from the flowing\nemulsion. This, in effect, triggers changes in the bulk shear viscosity. It is\nstriking to observe that the balance between electrical and hydrodynamic\nstresses is affected in such a way that surface tension gradient on the drop\nsurface vanishes for some specific shear rates and the corresponding effective\nchange in the bulk viscosity becomes negligible too. This critical condition\nhugely depends on the electrical permittivity and conductivity ratios of the\ntwo fluids and orientation of the applied electric field. Also the physical\nmechanisms of charge convection of surface deformation play their role in\ndetermining this critical shear rate. The charge convection instigated shear\nthinning or shear thickening behavior of the emulsion gets reversed due to a\ncoupled interaction of the charge convection and Marangoni stress. In addition,\nthe electrically created anisotropic normal stresses in the bulk rheology, get\nreduced due to the presence of surfactants, especially when the drop viscosity\nis much lesser than the continuous fluid. A thorough description of the\ndrop-level flow physics and its connection to the bulk rheology of a dilute\nemulsion, may provide a fundamental understanding of a more complex emulsion\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jan 2019 09:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

It is designed to cope with different profile\nattributes, content types and network links of different OSNs. The key idea is\nthat each piece of information about a user identity describes the real\nidentity owner, and thus distinguishes the owner from other users.

Our Factoid Embedding algorithm is designed such that\nas we learn the embedding space, each embedded factoid is \"translated\" into a\nmotion in the user embedding space to bring similar user identities closer, and\ndifferent user identities further apart.

Here we\nextend that analysis by demonstrating the existence of a static metastable\nsolution in a wide class of metrics that include a\nSchwarzschild-Rindler-AntideSitter spacetime (Grumiller metric) defined as\n$ds^2= f(r) dt^2 - f(r)^{-1} dr^2 - r^2 (d\\theta^2 +\\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2)$ with\n$f(r)=1-\\frac{2Gm}{r}+2br-\\frac{\\Lambda}{3} r^2$ ($\\Lambda<0\\; b<0$). This\nmetric emerges generically as a spherically symmetric vacuum solution in a\nclass of scalar-tensor theories\\cite{Grumiller:2010bz} as well as in Weyl\nconformal gravity\\cite{Mannheim:1988dj}. It also emerges in General Relativity\n(GR) in the presence of a cosmological constant and a proper spherically\nsymmetric perfect fluid. We demonstrate that this metric supports a static\nspherically symmetric metastable soliton scalar field solution that corresponds\nto a spherical domain wall. We derive the static solution numerically and\nidentify a range of parameters $m, b, \\Lambda$ of the metric for which the\nspherical wall is metastable. Our result is supported by both a minimization of\nthe scalar field energy functional with proper boundary conditions and by a\nnumerical simulation of the scalar field evolution.

In neighborhood-based\noptimization resources are allocated within virtual cells encompassing several\nbase-stations and the users within their coverage area. As the number of\nbase-stations within a virtual cell increases, the framework reverts to\ncentralized optimization, and as this number decreases it reverts to\ndecentralized optimization. We address two tasks that must be carried out in\nthe fog optimization framework: forming the virtual cells and allocating the\ncommunication resources in each virtual cell effectively. We propose\nhierarchical clustering for the formation of the virtual cells given a\nparticular number of such cells. Once the virtual cells are formed, we consider\nseveral optimization methods to solve the NP-hard joint channel access and\npower allocation problem within each virtual cell in order to maximize the sum\nrate of the entire system. We present numerical results for the system sum rate\nof each scheme under hierarchical clustering.

When the 'things' coordinate decisions and act\ncollectively on shared information, feedback is introduced between them.\nMultiple feedback loops are thus closed over a shared, general-purpose network.\nTraditional feedback control is unsuitable for design of IoT control because it\nrelies on high-rate periodic communication and is ignorant of the shared\nnetwork resource. Therefore, recent event-based estimation methods are applied\nherein for resource-aware IoT control allowing agents to decide online whether\ncommunication with other agents is needed, or not. While this can reduce\nnetwork traffic significantly, a severe limitation of typical event-based\napproaches is the need for instantaneous triggering decisions that leave no\ntime to reallocate freed resources (e.g., communication slots), which hence\nremain unused. To address this problem, novel predictive and self triggering\nprotocols are proposed herein. From a unified Bayesian decision framework, two\nschemes are developed: self triggers that predict, at the current triggering\ninstant, the next one; and predictive triggers that check at every time step,\nwhether communication will be needed at a given prediction horizon. The\nsuitability of these triggers for feedback control is demonstrated in hardware\nexperiments on a cart-pole, and scalability is discussed with a multi-vehicle\nsimulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2019 21:45:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-28"}

Then, taking into account nonlinear effects by\nconsidering the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, the corresponding zero point\n(vacuum) energy and the resulting modification of the speed of light are found\nup to the first non-vanishing correction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jan 2019 18:49:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-24"}

We have developed a photometric method to select red giant stars and\nestimate their atmospheric parameters from the photometric colors provided by\nthe SkyMapper Southern Survey (SMSS) data release (DR) 1.1, using stars in\ncommon with the LAMOST Galactic spectroscopic surveys as a training set.\nDistances are estimated with two different approaches: one based on the Gaia\nDR2 parallaxes for nearby ($d \\leq 4.5$ kpc) bright stars and another based on\nthe absolute magnitudes predicted by intrinsic color $(g-i)_0$ and photometric\nmetallicity [Fe/H] for distant ($d > 4.5$ kpc) faint stars. Various tests show\nthat our method is capable of delivering atmospheric parameters with a\nprecision of $\\sim$80 K for $T_{\\rm eff}$, $\\sim$0.18 dex for [Fe/H] and\n$\\sim$0.35 dex for log $g$, but with a significant systematic error at log $g\n\\sim$ 2.3. For distances delivered from $(g-i)_0$ and photometric [Fe/H], our\ntest with the member stars of globular clusters show a median uncertainty of 16\nper cent with a negligible zero-point offset. Using this method, atmospheric\nparameters and distances of nearly one million red giant stars are derived from\nSMSS DR1.1. Proper motion measurements from Gaia DR2 are available for almost\nall of the red giant stars, and radial velocity measurements from several large\nspectroscopic surveys are available for 44 per cent of these.
