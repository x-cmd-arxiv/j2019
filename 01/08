CM-like asteroids (Ch and Cgh classes) are a major population within\nthe broader C-complex, encompassing about 10% of the mass of the main asteroid\nbelt. Their internal structure has been predicted to be homogeneous, based on\ntheir compositional similarity as inferred from spectroscopy (Vernazza et al.,\n2016, AJ 152, 154) and numerical modeling of their early thermal evolution\n(Bland & Travis, 2017, Sci. Adv. 3, e1602514). Aims. Here we aim to test this\nhypothesis by deriving the density of the CM-like asteroid (41) Daphne from\ndetailed modeling of its shape and the orbit of its small satellite. Methods.\nWe observed Daphne and its satellite within our imaging survey with the Very\nLarge Telescope extreme adaptive-optics SPHERE/ZIMPOL camera (ID 199.C-0074, PI\nP. Vernazza) and complemented this data set with earlier Keck/NIRC2 and\nVLT/NACO observations. We analyzed the dynamics of the satellite with our\nGenoid meta-heuristic algorithm. Combining our high-angular resolution images\nwith optical lightcurves and stellar occultations, we determine the spin\nperiod, orientation, and 3-D shape, using our ADAM shape modeling algorithm.\nResults. The satellite orbits Daphne on an equatorial, quasi-circular, prograde\norbit, like the satellites of many other large main-belt asteroids. The shape\nmodel of Daphne reveals several large flat areas that could be large impact\ncraters. The mass determined from this orbit combined with the volume computed\nfrom the shape model implies a density for Daphne of 1.77+/-0.26 g/cm3 (3\n{\\sigma}). This density is consistent with a primordial CM-like homogeneous\ninternal structure with some level of macroporosity (~17%). Conclusions. Based\non our analysis of the density of Daphne and 75 other Ch/Cgh-type asteroids\ngathered from the literature, we conclude that the primordial internal\nstructure of the CM parent bodies was homogeneous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 16:06:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

The reconstruction of the above data\nrequires (i) phase compensation to combine data from different shots and (ii)\nslice unfolding to separate the data of different slices. The traditional\napproach is to first estimate the phase maps corresponding to each shot from a\nnavigator or from the slice-aliased individual shot data. The phase maps are\nsubsequently fed to a iterative reconstruction scheme to recover the slice\nunfolded DWIs. We propose a novel reconstruction method to jointly recover the\nslice-unfolded k-space data of the multiple shots. The proposed reconstruction\nis enabled by the low-rank property inherent in the k-space samples of a ms-DW\nacquisition. Specifically, we recover the missing samples of the multi-shot\nacquisition by enforcing a low-rank penalty on the block-Hankel matrix formed\nby the k-space data of each shot for each slice. The joint recovery of the\nslice-unfolded k-space data is then performed using a SENSE-based\nslice-unfolding subject to the low-rank constraint. The proposed joint recovery\nscheme is tested on simulated and in-vivo data and compared to similar\nun-navigated methods at slice acceleration factors of 2 and 3. Results: Our\nexperiments show effective slice unaliasing and successful recovery of DWIs\nwith minimal phase artifacts using the proposed method. The performance is\ncomparable to existing methods at low acceleration factors and better than\nexisting methods as the acceleration factor increase. Conclusion: For the slice\nacceleration factors considered in this study, the proposed method can\nsuccessfully recover DWIs from SMS-accelerated ms-DWI acquisitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 16:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

Radiative cooling, feedback from supernovae and\nactive galactic nuclei, large-scale dynamics and dissipation of turbulent\nenergy act over various time and spatial scales, and all regulate star\nformation in a complex gas cycle. This paper presents the physics implemented\nin a new semi-analytical model of galaxy formation and evolution: G.A.S.. The\nfundamental underpinning of our new model is the development of a multi-phase\ninterstellar medium in which energy produced by supernovae and active galactic\nnuclei maintains an equilibrium between the diffuse, hot, stable gas and a\ncooler, clumpy, low-volume filling factor gas. The hot gas is susceptible to\nthermal and dynamical instabilities. We include a description of how turbulence\nleads to the formation of giant molecular clouds through an inertial turbulent\nenergy cascade. We explicitly model the evolution of the velocity dispersion at\ndifferent scales of the cascade and account for thermal instabilities in the\nhot halo gas. We show that rapid and multiple exchanges between diffuse and\nunstable gas phases strongly regulates star-formation rates in galaxies because\nonly a small fraction of the unstable gas is forming stars. For high mass\nhalos, cooling is naturally regulated by the growth of thermal instabilities,\nso we do not need to implement strong AGN feedback. The characteristic\ntimescales describing the gas cycle are in good agreement with observations.\nResults are in good agreement with the observed stellar mass function from\nz=6.0 to z=0.5. Thermal instabilities and the cascade of turbulent energy in\nthe dense gas phase introduce a delay between gas accretion and star formation,\nwhich keeps galaxy growth inefficient in the early Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 16:28:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Jan 2019 19:52:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 12:58:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

In\na price-coupling game, there is a part of the objective function of a player\nwhich has an identical form for all players and there is coupling in the cost\nfunctions of players through a price which is determined uniformly for all\nplayers by an independent entity called the \\textit{price-determining player}\n(e.g. independent system operator (ISO) in an electricity market). This price\nappears in the objective function only in the part which is identical for all\nplayers. We study the existence of equilibria in such games under two broad\ncategories, namely \\textit{price-anticipative} and \\textit{price-taking}\nformulations. In the price-anticipative formulation, the players anticipate the\nprice and make their decisions while in the price-taking formulation, the\nplayers make their decisions considering the price as a given parameter. We\nmodel the price-anticipative case as a leader-follower formulation where the\nplayers (leaders) conjecture the price (follower's decision) and make their\ndecision. The price-taking formulation is modelled as an $N+1$ player game with\nthe additional player as the price-determining player. The existence of an\nequilibrium in such games are not easy mainly because of the coupled-constraint\nstructure of the game and the non-convexity of the action set.

Spectroscopic monitoring between 389\nand 480 days post explosion reveals strong CO first overtone emission at 389 d,\nwith a line profile matching that of SN 1987A from the same epoch, indicating\n$\\sim 10^{-3} \\, M_{\\odot}$ of CO at 1,800 K. From the 389 d epoch until the\nmost recent observation at 566 d, the first overtone feature fades while the\n4.5 $\\mu$m excess, likely from the CO fundamental band, remains. This behavior\nindicates that the CO has not been destroyed, but that the gas has cooled\nenough that the levels responsible for first overtone emissions are no longer\npopulated.

Flooding, as a broadcast\nmechanism, involves each node forwarding any packet it receives to all its\nneighbours. This results in excessive transmissions and thus a high energy\nexpenditure overall. Probabilistic forwarding or gossiping involves each node\nforwarding a received packet to all its neighbours only with a certain\nprobability $p$. In this paper, we study the effect of introducing redundancy,\nin the form of coded packets, into a probabilistic forwarding protocol.\nSpecifically, we assume that the source node has $k$ data packets to broadcast,\nwhich are encoded into $n \\ge k$ coded packets, such that any $k$ of these\ncoded packets are sufficient to recover the original $k$ data packets. Our\ninterest is in determining the minimum forwarding probability $p$ for a\n\"successful broadcast\", which we take to be the event that the expected\nfraction of network nodes that receive at least $k$ of the $n$ coded packets is\nclose to 1. We examine, via simulations and analysis of a number of different\nnetwork topologies (e.g., trees, grids, random geometric graphs), how this\nminimum forwarding probability, and correspondingly, the expected total number\nof packet transmissions varies with the amount of redundancy added. Our\nsimulation results indicate that over network topologies that are highly\nconnected, the introduction of redundancy into the probabilistic forwarding\nprotocol is useful, as it can significantly reduce the expected total number of\ntransmissions needed for a successful broadcast. On the other hand, for trees,\nour analysis shows that the expected total number of transmissions needed\nincreases with redundancy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 19:37:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 18:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-11"}

For this reason, they have gained prominence in\nmany machine learning applications that rely on subset selection. However,\nsampling from a DPP over a ground set of size $N$ is a costly operation,\nrequiring in general an $O(N^3)$ preprocessing cost and an $O(Nk^3)$ sampling\ncost for subsets of size $k$. We approach this problem by introducing DPPNets:\ngenerative deep models that produce DPP-like samples for arbitrary ground sets.\nWe develop an inhibitive attention mechanism based on transformer networks that\ncaptures a notion of dissimilarity between feature vectors. We show\ntheoretically that such an approximation is sensible as it maintains the\nguarantees of inhibition or dissimilarity that makes DPPs so powerful and\nunique. Empirically, we demonstrate that samples from our model receive high\nlikelihood under the more expensive DPP alternative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 20:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

Approach: Experiments were performed\nin-vitro on cadavers immediately following euthanasia. Neural activity was\nevoked via stimulation of nerves in the hind paw, while carrier signals were\ninjected, and recordings obtained, with a dual ring nerve cuff implanted on the\nsciatic nerve. Frequency analysis of recorded compound action potentials (CAPs)\nand extracted impedance changes, with the latter obtained using established\ndemodulation methods, were used to determine suitable frequency spacing of\ncarrier signals, and bandpass filter (BPF) bandwidth and order, for a frequency\nmultiplexed signal. Main results: CAPs and impedance changes were dominant in\nthe frequency band 200 to 500 Hz and 100 to 200 Hz, respectively. A Tukey\nwindow was introduced to remove ringing from Gibbs phenomena. A +/- 750 Hz BPF\nbandwidth was selected to encompass 99.99 % of the frequency power of the\nimpedance change. Modelling predicted a minimum BPF order of 16 for 2 kHz\nspacing, and 10 for 4 kHz spacing, were required to avoid ringing from the\nneighbouring carrier signal, while FDM experiments verified BPF orders of 12\nand 8, respectively, were required. With a notch filter centred on the\nneighbouring signal, a BPF order of at least 6 or 4 was required for 2 and 4\nkHz, respectively. Significance: The results establish drive frequency spacing\nand demodulation settings for use in FDM electrical impedance tomography (EIT)\nexperiments, as well as a framework for their selection, and, for the first\ntime, demonstrates the viability of FDM-EIT of neural activity on peripheral\nnerve, which will be a central aspect of future real-time neural-EIT systems\nand EIT-based neural prosthetics interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 21:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-28"}

In the first part, the global\nsupersymmetric case is analysed. The discussion starts from the supersymmetry\nbreaking sector, describing the goldstino and its interactions, in the case of\nminimal supersymmetry and it is then generalised to a generic number of\nspontaneously broken supersymmetry generators. A systematic procedure is given\nin order to construct effective theories with non-linearly realised\nsupersymmetry and with any desired spectrum content. In the second part of the\nthesis, non-linear realisations are analysed in the case of local\nsupersymmetry, namely supergravity. The coupling of the goldstino sector to\ngravity is presented first and the superhiggs mechanism on a generic background\nis discussed. Matter couplings are then constructed in some simple examples. A\nnew class of models is introduced in which supersymmetry is spontaneously\nbroken and non-linearly realised already on the gravity sector. As a\nconsequence, it is possible to construct actions in which the cosmological\nconstant is bounded to be positive, which can be motivated for studying\ninflation. Two applications of non-linear realisations in local supersymmetry\nare discussed in detail. In the first one it is shown how to implement K\\\"ahler\ninvariance in a way that mimics the global supersymmetric case. In particular,\nthe K\\\"ahler--Hodge restriction on the scalar manifold, which is typical of\nsupergravity, is avoided. In the second application the role of non-linear\nrealisations in the construction of de Sitter vacua is discussed.

Coherency arises from time-scale\nseparation in the dynamics of synchronous generators, where generator states\ninside a coherent area synchronize over a fast time-scale due to stronger\ncoupling, while the areas themselves synchronize over a slower time-scale due\nto weaker coupling. This time-scale separation is reflected in the form of a\nspectral separation in the weighted Laplacian matrix describing the swing\ndynamics of the generators. However, when wind farms with doubly-fed induction\ngenerators (DFIG) are integrated in the system then this Laplacian matrix\nchanges based on both the level of wind penetration and the location of the\nwind farms. The modified Laplacian changes the effective slow eigenspace of the\ngenerators. Depending on penetration level, this change may result in changing\nthe identities of the coherent areas.

Experiments on Nb-Mo, Fe-Si and\nTi-Zr-Nb alloys report decreased mobility of edge dislocations, motivating a\ntheory of strengthening of edge dislocations in BCC alloys. Unlike pure BCC\nmetals and dilute alloys that are controlled by screw dislocation motion at low\ntemperatures, the strength of BCC HEAs can be controlled by edge dislocations,\nand especially at high temperatures, due to the barriers created for edge glide\nthrough the random field of solutes. A parameter-free theory for edge motion in\nBCC alloys qualitatively and quantitatively captures the strength versus\ntemperature for the MoNbTaW and MoNbTaVW alloys. A reduced analytic version of\nthe theory then enables screening over >600,000 compositions in the\nMo-Nb-Ta-V-W family, identifying promising new compositions with high retained\nstrength and/or reduced mass density.

Pruning techniques\nand Winograd convolution are two typical methods to reduce the CNN computation.\nHowever, they cannot be directly combined because Winograd transformation fills\nin the sparsity resulting from pruning. Li et al. (2017) propose sparse\nWinograd convolution in which weights are directly pruned in the Winograd\ndomain, but this technique is not very practical because Winograd-domain\nretraining requires low learning rates and hence significantly longer training\ntime. Besides, Liu et al. (2018) move the ReLU function into the Winograd\ndomain, which can help increase the weight sparsity but requires changes in the\nnetwork structure. To achieve a high Winograd-domain weight sparsity without\nchanging network structures, we propose a new pruning method, spatial-Winograd\npruning. As the first step, spatial-domain weights are pruned in a structured\nway, which efficiently transfers the spatial-domain sparsity into the Winograd\ndomain and avoids Winograd-domain retraining. For the next step, we also\nperform pruning and retraining directly in the Winograd domain but propose to\nuse an importance factor matrix to adjust weight importance and weight\ngradients. This adjustment makes it possible to effectively retrain the pruned\nWinograd-domain network without changing the network structure. For the three\nmodels on the datasets of CIFAR10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, our proposed method\ncan achieve the Winograd domain sparsities of 63%, 50%, and 74%, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 02:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

However, the lack of intrinsic uncertainty\nassessment has blurred guidelines for how thermal history models can be used\ntoward this end. A model, as a representation of something real, is not\nexpected to be complete. Unmodeled effects are assumed to be small enough that\nthe model maintains utility for the issue(s) it was designed to address. The\ndegree to which this holds depends on how unmodeled factors affect the\ncertainty of model predictions. We quantify this intrinsic uncertainty for\nseveral parameterized thermal history models (a widely used subclass of\nplanetary models). Single perturbation analysis is used to determine the\nreactance time of different models. This provides a metric for how long it\ntakes low amplitude, unmodeled effects to decay or grow. Reactance time is\nshown to scale inversely with the strength of the dominant feedback (negative\nor positive) within a model. A perturbed physics analysis is then used to\ndetermine uncertainty shadows for model outputs. This provides probability\ndistributions for model predictions and tests the structural stability of a\nmodel. That is, do model predictions remain qualitatively similar, and within\nassumed model limits, in the face of intrinsic uncertainty. Once intrinsic\nuncertainty is accounted for, model outputs/predictions and comparisons to\nobservational data should be treated in a probabilistic way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 02:36:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

This process\ntakes place exclusively within the individual photomultiplier tubes (PMTs),\nwith two familiar actors (thermionic electrons and helium atoms), two familiar\nprocesses (helium penetration of glass and ion afterpulsing), and a simple\nstoryline: (a) After defeating the insulation of the DAMA detector, helium\natoms from the variable local environment penetrate the PMT vacua; (b)\nThermionic electrons from the PMT photocathode ionize helium atoms; (c)\nSecondary electrons from each helium ion impact in the photocathode form an\nafterpulse, and thus effectively boost and extend the waveform.

Akin to the correlation matrix, a multivariate\ndependence measure is constructed using these bivariate measures, and this is\nreferred to in the literature as the tail dependence matrix (TDM). While the\nproblem of determining whether a given ${d\\times d}$ matrix is a correlation\nmatrix is of the order $O(d^3)$ in complexity, determining if a matrix is a TDM\n(the realization problem) is believed to be non-polynomial in complexity. Using\na linear programming (LP) formulation, we show that the combinatorial structure\nof the constraints is related to the intractable max-cut problem in a weighted\ngraph. This connection provides an avenue for constructing parametric classes\nadmitting a polynomial in $d$ algorithm for determining membership in its\nconstraint polytope. The complexity of the general realization problem is\njustifiably of much theoretical interest.

A key element of DRO\nis the construction of the ambiguity set, which is a set of distributions that\ncovers the true distribution with a high probability. Assuming that the true\ndistribution has a probability density function, we propose a class of\nambiguity sets based on confidence bands of the true density function. The use\nof the confidence band enables us to take the prior knowledge of the shape of\nthe underlying density function into consideration (e.g., unimodality or\nmonotonicity). Using the confidence band constructed by density estimation\ntechniques as the ambiguity set, we establish the convergence of the optimal\nvalue of DRO to that of the stochastic program as the sample size increases.\nHowever, the resulting DRO problem is computationally intractable, as it\ninvolves functional decision variables as well as infinitely many constraints.\nTo address this challenge, using the duality theory, we reformulate it into a\nfinite-dimensional stochastic program, which is amenable to a stochastic\nsubgradient scheme as a solution method.

Consequently, the behavior of networks consisting\nof random Gaussian weights only is not useful to explain how DNNs achieve\nstate-of-art results in a large variety of problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 07:20:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 17:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

Here we\nshow, via neutron diffraction on the single-crystal CrAs under hydrostatic\npressure (P), that the combined order is suppressed at Pc ~ 10 kbar, near which\nbulk superconductivity develops with a maximal transition temperature Tc ~ 2 K.\nWe further show that the coupled order is also completely suppressed by\nphosphorus doping in CrAs1-xPx at a critical xc ~ 0.05, above which inelastic\nneutron scattering evidenced persistent antiferromagnetic correlations,\nproviding a possible link between magnetism and superconductivity. In line with\nthe presence of antiferromagnetic fluctuations near Pc (xc), the A coefficient\nof the quadratic temperature dependence of resistivity exhibits a dramatic\nenhancement as P (x) approaches Pc (xc), around which Res(T) has a\nnon-Fermi-liquid form.

In addition,\ndeep networks provide exponential approximation accuracy - i.e., the\napproximation error decays exponentially in the number of nonzero weights in\nthe network - of the multiplication operation, polynomials, sinusoidal\nfunctions, and certain smooth functions. Moreover, this holds true even for\none-dimensional oscillatory textures and the Weierstrass function - a fractal\nfunction, neither of which has previously known methods achieving exponential\napproximation accuracy. We also show that in the approximation of sufficiently\nsmooth functions finite-width deep networks require strictly smaller\nconnectivity than finite-depth wide networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 09:41:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 09:25:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2021 14:16:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 13:59:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-15"}

This\nis particularly true for synthetic MCSs employing biological components as\ntransmitters and receivers or as interfaces with natural biological MCSs.\nNevertheless, since such biological components have been optimized by nature\nover billions of years, using them in synthetic MCSs is highly promising. This\npaper provides a survey of biological components that can potentially serve as\nthe main building blocks, i.e., transmitter, receiver, and signaling particles,\nfor the design and implementation of synthetic MCSs. Nature uses a large\nvariety of signaling particles of different sizes and with vastly different\nproperties for communication among biological entities. Here, we focus on three\nimportant classes of signaling particles: cations (specifically protons and\ncalcium ions), neurotransmitters (specifically acetylcholine, dopamine, and\nserotonin), and phosphopeptides. For each of these candidate signaling\nparticles, we present several specific transmitter and receiver structures\nmainly built upon proteins that are capable of performing the distinct\nphysiological functionalities required from the transmitters and receivers of\nMCSs. Moreover, we present options for both microscale implementation of MCSs\nas well as the micro-to-macroscale interfaces needed for experimental\nevaluation of MCSs.

To this\nend, we leverage a Bag of visual Word representation within the network and\nassociate a visual and semantic meaning to the corresponding codebook elements\nvia the use of a generative adversarial network. The reason behind the\nprediction for a new sample can then be interpreted by looking at the visual\nrepresentation of the most highly activated codeword.

To fully utilise\nall GPUs, systems must increase the batch size, which hinders statistical\nefficiency.

To elucidate how these drops can exhibit such strikingly\ndifferent dynamics and `decide' what to do, we propose a minimal axisymmetric\nmodel of a spherical active drop, and show that simple and linear interface\nproperties can lead to both steady self-propulsion of the droplet as well as\nchaotic behavior. The model includes two different mobility mechanisms, namely,\ndiffusiophoresis and the Marangoni effect, that convert self-generated\ngradients of surfactant concentration into the flow at the droplet surface. In\nturn, surface-driven flow initiates surfactant advection that is the only\nnonlinear mechanism and, thus, the only source of dynamical complexity in our\nmodel. Numerical investigation of the fully-coupled hydrodynamic and advection\ndiffusion problems reveals that strong advection (e.g., large droplet size) may\ndestabilize a steadily self-propelling drop; once destabilized, the droplet\nspontaneously stops and a symmetric extensile flow emerges. If advection is\nstrengthened even further in comparison with molecular diffusion, the droplet\nmay perform chaotic oscillations. Our results indicate that the thresholds of\nthese instabilities depend heavily on the balance between diffusiophoresis and\nthe Marangoni effect. Using linear stability analysis, we demonstrate that\ndiffusiophoresis promotes the onset of high-order modes of monotonic\ninstability of the motionless drop. We argue that diffusiophoresis has a\nsimilar effect on the instabilities of a moving drop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 11:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Exploring the galaxy assembly history together with the dark\nmatter haloes properties through time can provide a way to measure these\neffects. Methods: We study the properties of four Milky Way mass dark matter\nhaloes from the Aquarius project during their assembly history, between $z = 0\n- 4$. In this work, we use the SPH run from Scannapieco et al. (2009) and the\ndark matter only counterpart as case studies. To asses the robustness of our\nfindings, we compare them with one of the haloes run using a moving-mesh\ntechnique and different sub-grid scheme. Results: Our results show that the\ncosmic evolution of the dark matter halo profiles depends on the assembly\nhistory of the baryons. We find that the dark matter profiles do not\nsignificantly change with time, hence they become stable, when the fraction of\nbaryons accumulated in the central regions reaches 80 percent of its present\nmass within the virial radius. Furthermore, the mass accretion history shows\nthat the haloes that assembled earlier are those that contain a larger amount\nof baryonic mass aforetime, which in turn allows the dark matter halo profiles\nto reach a stable configuration earlier. For the SPH haloes, we find that the\nspecific angular momentum of the dark matter particles within the five percent\nof the virial radius at z = 0, remains approximately constant from the time at\nwhich 60 percent of the stellar mass is gathered. We explore different\ntheoretical and empirical models for the contraction of the haloes through\nredshift. A model to better describe the contraction of the haloes through\nredshift evolution must depend on the stellar mass content in the inner\nregions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 11:56:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

To circumvent this impossibility result, we present\ntwo schemes; unlike the existing methods, our schemes do not require noise\nrate. The first one uses $\\alpha$-weighted $\\gamma$-uneven margin squared loss\nfunction, $l_{\\alpha, usq}$, which can handle cost sensitivity arising due to\ndomain requirement (using user given $\\alpha$) or class imbalance (by tuning\n$\\gamma$) or both. However, we observe that $l_{\\alpha, usq}$ Bayes classifiers\nare also not cost sensitive and noise robust. We show that regularized ERM of\nthis loss function over the class of linear classifiers yields a cost sensitive\nuniform noise robust classifier as a solution of a system of linear equations.\nWe also provide a performance bound for this classifier. The second scheme that\nwe propose is a re-sampling based scheme that exploits the special structure of\nthe uniform noise models and uses in-class probability $\\eta$ estimates. Our\ncomputational experiments on some UCI datasets with class imbalance show that\nclassifiers of our two schemes are on par with the existing methods and in fact\nbetter in some cases w.r.t.

Phase-mixing of Alfv\\'en waves is considered a candidate mechanism, as\nit can develop transverse gradient where magnetic energy can be converted into\nthermal energy. However, phase-mixing is a process that crucially depends on\nthe amplitude and period of the transverse oscillations, and only recently have\nwe obtained a complete measurement of the power spectrum for transverse\noscillations in the corona. We aim to investigate the heating generated by\nphase-mixing of transverse oscillations triggered by buffeting of a coronal\nloop that follows from the observed coronal power spectrum as well as the\nimpact of these persistent oscillations on the structure of coronal loops. We\nconsider a 3D MHD model of an active region coronal loop and we perturb its\nfootpoints with a 2D horizontal driver that represents a random buffeting\nmotion of the loop footpoints. Our driver is composed of 1000 pulses\nsuperimposed to generate the observed power spectrum. We find that the heating\nsupply from the observed power spectrum in the solar corona through phase\nmixing is not sufficient to maintain the million degree active region solar\ncorona. We also find that the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities\ncould be a common phenomenon in coronal loops that could affect their apparent\nlife time. This study concludes that is unlikely that phase-mixing of Alfv\\'en\nwaves resulting from an observed power spectrum of transverse coronal loop\noscillations can heat the active region solar corona.

We focus on bi-layer networks with the two layers comprising\ndifferent number of nodes in general and where the ratio of intra-layer to\ninter-layer connections, $r$, can be varied, keeping the total number of nodes\nand overall connection density invariant. We observe that while the responses\nof the different networks to random breakdown of nodes are similar, dominantly\nintra-dependent networks ($r\\ll1$) are robust with respect to attacks that\ntarget nodes having highest degree but when nodes are removed on the basis of\nhighest betweenness centrality (CB), they exhibit a sharp decrease in the size\nof the largest connected component (resembling a first order phase transition)\nfollowed by a more gradual decrease as more nodes are removed (akin to a second\norder transition). We also explore the role of layer size heterogeneity on\nrobustness, finding that for a given $r$ having layers comprising very\ndifferent number of nodes results in a bimodal degree distribution. For\ndominantly inter-dependent networks, this results in the nodes of the smaller\nlayer becoming structurally central. Selective removal of these nodes, which\nconstitute a relatively small fraction of the network, leads to breakdown of\nthe entire system - making the inter-dependent networks even more fragile to\ntargeted attacks than scale-free networks having power-law degree distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 14:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

This question is central to a great deal of methods\nfor functional data, which require low-dimensional representations whether by\nfunctional PCA or other methods. The difficulty is that the determination is to\nbe made on the basis of i.i.d. replications of the process observed discretely\nand with measurement error contamination. This adds a ridge to the empirical\ncovariance, obfuscating the underlying dimension. We build a matrix-completion\ninspired test statistic that circumvents this issue by measuring the best\npossible least square fit of the empirical covariance's off-diagonal elements,\noptimised over covariances of given finite rank. For a fixed grid of\nsufficiently large size, we determine the statistic's asymptotic null\ndistribution as the number of replications grows.

The cooling of molten metal inside the mold is achieved\ntypically by passing water through the cooling lines in the die. Depending on\nthe cooling line location, coolant flow rate and die geometry, nonuniform\ntemperatures are imposed on the molten metal at the mold wall. This boundary\ncondition along with the initial molten metal temperature affect the product\nquality quantified in terms of micro-structure parameters and yield strength. A\nfinite volume based numerical solver is used to determine the temperature-time\nhistory and correlate the inputs to outputs. The objective of this research is\nto develop and demonstrate a procedure to obtain the initial and wall\ntemperatures so as to optimize the product quality. The non-dominated sorting\ngenetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used for multi-objective optimization in this\nwork.

In this work we carry out a path integral\nformulation to compute the transition amplitude for this particle. The\nformalism yields the action of such a particle in an arbitrary potential.\nInterestingly, the action indicates that there is an upper bound to the\nvelocity that a particle can have which depends on the generalized uncertainty\nprinciple parameter.

We derive closed analytic expressions for the effective\ndispersion equation in all considered scenarios providing hands-on effective\ndispersion parameters for a multitude of applications.

In a\nmyriad of situations the result of a computation is further manipulated,\ninterpreted, and finally acted upon. This allows for the computation to be\nrelaxed, so that the result is calculated with \"good enough\", not perfect\naccuracy.

Contemporary embedding models are evaluated qualitatively in terms\nof how adequate they are in relation to the capabilities of a Derridian\nEmbedding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 06:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

The\nactual scale-free networking of urban street networks in their topological\nspace, where navigation information is encoded by mapping roads to nodes and\njunctions to links between nodes, has still no simple explanation. Emphasizing\nthe road-junction hierarchy in a holistic and systematic way leads us to\nenvisage urban street networks as evolving social systems subject to a\nBoltzmann-mesoscopic entropy conservation. This conservation, which we may\ninterpret in terms of surprisal, ensures the passage from the road-junction\nhierarchy to a scale-free coherence. To wit, we recover the actual scale-free\nprobability distribution for natural roads in self-organized cities. We obtain\nthis passage by invoking Jaynes's Maximum Entropy principle (statistical\nphysics), while we capitalize on modern ideas of quantification (information\nphysics) and well known results on structuration (lattice theory) to measure\nthe information network entropy. The emerging paradigm, which applies to\nsystems with more intricate hierarchies as actual cities, appears to reflect\nwell the influential ideas on cities of the urbanist Christopher Alexander.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jan 2019 07:13:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 11:30:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-03"}
