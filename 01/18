This information assists point spread function reconstruction, AO\ntemporal control techniques and is required by wide-field AO systems to\noptimize the reconstruction of an observed wavefront. The variability of the\natmosphere makes it important to have a measure of the optical turbulence\nprofile in real time. This measurement can be performed by fitting an\nanalytically generated covariance matrix to the cross-covariance of\nShack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWFS) centroids. In this study we explore the\nbenefits of reducing cross-covariance data points to a covariance map region of\ninterest (ROI). A technique for using the covariance map ROI to measure and\ncompensate for SHWFS misalignments is also introduced. We compare the accuracy\nof covariance matrix and map ROI optical turbulence profiling using both\nsimulated and on-sky data from CANARY, an AO demonstrator on the 4.2 m William\nHerschel telescope, La Palma. On-sky CANARY results are compared to\ncontemporaneous profiles from Stereo-SCIDAR - a dedicated high-resolution\noptical turbulence profiler. It is shown that the covariance map ROI optimizes\nthe accuracy of AO telemetry optical turbulence profiling. In addition, we show\nthat the covariance map ROI reduces the fitting time for an extremely large\ntelescope-scale system by a factor of 72. The software package we developed to\ncollect all of the presented results is now open source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 16:07:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-18"}

The goal\nis to determine entangling abilities of such arbitrary bipartite quantum\ninteractions. Doing so provides fundamental limitations on information\nprocessing tasks, including entanglement distillation and secret key\ngeneration, over a bipartite quantum network. We also discuss limitations on\nthe entropy change and its rate for dynamics of an open quantum system weakly\ninteracting with the bath. We introduce a measure of non-unitarity to\ncharacterize the deviation of a doubly stochastic quantum process from a\nnoiseless evolution.\n  Next, we introduce information processing tasks for secure read-out of\ndigital information encoded in read-only memory devices against adversaries of\nvarying capabilities. The task of reading a memory device involves the\nidentification of an interaction process between probe system, which is in\nknown state, and the memory device. Essentially, the information is stored in\nthe choice of channels, which are noisy quantum processes in general and are\nchosen from a publicly known set. Hence, it becomes pertinent to securely read\nmemory devices against scrutiny of an adversary. In particular, for a secure\nread-out task called private reading when a reader is under surveillance of a\npassive eavesdropper, we have determined upper bounds on its performance. We do\nso by leveraging the fact that private reading of digital information stored in\na memory device can be understood as secret key agreement via a specific kind\nof bipartite quantum interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 16:56:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-18"}

This may\nbe particularly useful for large mass binaries, for which the early inspiral\nwaves are out of the detectors' most sensitive band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 17:04:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 16:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-18"}

In this\npaper, the private authentication problem is considered which consists of a\ncertificate authority, a verifier (or some verifiers), many legitimate users\n(provers), and an arbitrary number of attackers. Each legitimate user wants to\nbe authenticated (using his personal key) by the verifier(s), while\nsimultaneously staying completely anonymous (even to the verifier). On the\nother hand, an attacker must fail to be authenticated. We analyze this problem\nfrom an information-theoretical perspective and propose a general interactive\ninformation-theoretic model for the problem. As a metric to measure the\nreliability, we consider the normalized total key rate whose maximization has a\ntrade-off with establishing privacy. The problem is considered in two different\nscenarios: single-server scenario (only one verifier is considered, which all\nthe provers are connected to) and multi-server scenario ($N$ verifiers are\nassumed, where each verifier is connected to a subset of users). For both\nscenarios, two regimes are considered: finite size regime (i.e., the variables\nare elements of a finite field) and asymptotic regime (i.e., the variables are\nconsidered to have large enough length). We propose achievable schemes that\nsatisfy the completeness, soundness, and privacy properties in both\nsingle-server and multi-server scenarios in all cases. In the finite size\nregime, the main idea is to generate the authentication keys according to a\nsecret sharing scheme. We show that the proposed scheme in the special case of\nmulti-server authentication in the finite size regime is optimal. In the\nasymptotic regime, we use a random binning based scheme that relies on the\njoint typicality to generate the authentication keys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 17:50:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 11:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 08:09:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 14:43:10 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 08:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Despite considerable progress in designing\nefficient denoising algorithms, for general analog sources,\ntheoretically-founded computationally-efficient methods are yet to be found.\nFor instance in denoising $X^n$ corrupted by noise $Z^n$ as $Y^n=X^n+Z^n$,\ngiven the full distribution of $X^n$, a minimum mean square error (MMSE)\ndenoiser needs to compute $E[X^n|Y^n]$. However, for general sources, computing\n$E[X^n|Y^n]$ is computationally very challenging, if not infeasible. In this\npaper, starting by a Bayesian setup, where the source distribution is fully\nknown, a novel denoising method, namely, quantized maximum a posteriori (Q-MAP)\ndenoiser, is proposed and its asymptotic performance in the high signal to\nnoise ratio regime is analyzed. Both for memoryless sources, and for structured\nfirst-order Markov sources, it is shown that, asymptotically, as $\\sigma$\nconverges to zero, ${1\\over \\sigma^2}E[(X_i-\\hat{X}^{\\rm Q-MAP}_i)^2]$ achieved\nby Q-MAP denoiser converges to the information dimension of the source. For the\nstudied memoryless sources, this limit is known to be optimal. A key advantage\nof the Q-MAP denoiser is that, unlike an MMSE denoiser, it highlights the key\nproperties of the source distribution that are to be used in its denoising.\nThis property dramatically reduces the computational complexity of\napproximating the solution of the Q-MAP denoiser. Additionally, it naturally\nleads to a learning-based denoiser. Using ImageNet database for training,\ninitial simulation results exploring the performance of such a learning-based\ndenoiser in image denoising are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 18:20:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 21:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}

Defects in\nhexagonal boron nitride (hBN) exhibit high-brightness, room-temperature quantum\nemission, but their large spectral variability and unknown local structure\nsignificantly challenge their technological utility. Here, we directly\ncorrelate hBN quantum emission with the material's local strain using a\ncombination of photoluminescence (PL), cathodoluminescence (CL) and nano-beam\nelectron diffraction. Across 40 emitters and 15 samples, we observe zero phonon\nlines(ZPLs) in PL and CL ranging from 540-720 nm. CL mapping reveals that\nmultiple defects and distinct defect species located within an\noptically-diffraction-limited region can each contribute to the observed PL\nspectra. Local strain maps indicate that strain is not required to activate the\nemitters and is not solely responsible for the observed ZPL spectral range.\nInstead, four distinct defect classes are responsible for the observed emission\nrange. One defect class has ZPLs near 615 nm with predominantly matched CL-PL\nresponses; it is not a strain-tuned version of another defect class with ZPL\nemission centered at 580 nm. A third defect class at 650 nm has low\nvisible-frequency CL emission; and a fourth defect species centered at 705 nm\nhas a small, ~10 nm shift between its CL and PL peaks.

Here we analyse 11\nmetal-poor stars of which 10 are CEMP stars. Based on high signal-to-noise\n(SNR) X-Shooter spectra, we derive abundances of 20 elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg,\nCa, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Sr, Y, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu). From the high SNR\nspectra, we trace the chemical contribution of the rare earth elements (REE)\nfrom various production sites, finding a preference for metal-poor low-mass AGB\nstars of 1.5Mo in CEMP-s stars, while CEMP-r/s stars may indicate a more\nmassive AGB contribution (2-5Mo). A contribution from the r-process - possibly\nfrom neutron star mergers (NSM), is also detectable in the REE abundances,\nespecially in the CEMP-r/s. Combining spectra with Gaia DR2 astrometric data\nindicates that all but one star in our sample (and most literature stars)\nbelong to the Galactic halo. They exhibit a median orbital eccentricity of 0.7,\nand are found on both pro- and retrograde orbits. The orbital parameters of\nCEMP-no and CEMP4s stars are remarkably similar in the 98 stars we study. A\nspecial CEMP-no star, with very low Sr and Ba content, possesses the most\neccentric orbit among the stars in our sample, passing close to the Galactic\ncentre. Finally, we propose an improved scheme to sub-classify the CEMP stars,\nmaking use of the Sr$/$Ba ratio, which can also be used to separate very\nmetal-poor stars from CEMP stars in 93 stars in the metallicity range\n$-4.2<$[Fe/H]$<-2$. The Sr/Ba ratio can also be used for distinguishing\nCEMP-s,-r/s and -no stars. The Sr/Ba ratio is also a powerful astro-nuclear\nindicator, as AGB stars exhibit very different Sr/Ba ratios, compared to fast\nrotating massive stars and NSM, and it is fairly unbiased by NLTE and 3D\ncorrections.(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

Using a set of radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with adaptive mesh\nrefinement, we investigate how photons propagate and escape from turbulent\nclouds with different masses, star formation efficiencies (SFEs), and\nmetallicities, as well as with different models of stellar spectra and\nsupernova feedback. We find that the escape fractions in both LyC and Lya are\ngenerally increasing with time if the cloud is efficiently dispersed by\nradiation and supernova feedback. When the total SFE is low (1% of the cloud\nmass), 0.1-5% of LyC photons leave the metal-poor cloud, whereas the fractions\nincrease to 20-70% in clouds with a 10% SFE. LyC photons escape more\nefficiently if gas metallicity is lower, if the upper mass limit in the stellar\ninitial mass function is higher, if binary interactions are allowed in the\nevolution of stars, or if additional strong radiation pressure, such as Lya\npressure, is present. As a result, the number of escaping LyC photons can\neasily vary by a factor of $\\sim4$ on cloud scales. The escape fractions of Lya\nphotons are systemically higher (60-80%) than those of LyC photons despite\nlarge optical depths at line centre ($\\tau_0\\sim10^6-10^9$).

S. Golan and by W. Kuich and A.\nSalomaa on semirings, ideals play an important role despite the fact that they\nneed not be congruence kernels as in the case of rings. Hence, having two\ncommutative semirings S1 and S2, one can ask whether an ideal I of their direct\nproduct S = S1 x S2 can be expressed in the form I1 x I2 where Ij is an ideal\nof Sj for j=1,2. Of course, the converse is elementary, namely if Ij is an\nideal of Sj for j=1,2 then I1 x I2 is an ideal of S1 x S2. Having a congruence\non a commutative semiring S, its 0-class is an ideal of S, but not every ideal\nis of this form. Hence, the lattice Id S of all ideals of S and the lattice Ker\nS of all congruence kernels (i.e. 0-classes of congruences) of S need not be\nequal. Furthermore, we show that the mapping which assigns to every congruence\nits kernel need not be a homomorphism from Con S onto Ker S. Moreover, the\nquestion arises when a congruence kernel of the direct product S1 x S2 of two\ncommutative semirings can be expressed as a direct product of the corresponding\nkernels on the factors. In the paper we present necessary and sufficient\nconditions for such direct decompositions both for ideals and for congruence\nkernels of commutative semirings.

Jobs with diverse resource requirements (e.g. memory\nrequirements) arrive over time and must be served by a cluster of servers, each\nwith a finite resource capacity. To improve throughput and delay, the scheduler\ncan pack as many jobs as possible in the servers subject to their capacity\nconstraints. Motivated by the ever-increasing complexity of workloads in shared\nclusters, we consider a setting where the jobs' resource requirements belong to\na very large number of diverse types or, in the extreme, even infinitely many\ntypes, e.g. when resource requirements are drawn from an unknown distribution\nover a continuous support. The application of classical scheduling approaches\nthat crucially rely on a predefined finite set of types is discouraging in this\nhigh (or infinite) dimensional setting. We first characterize a fundamental\nlimit on the maximum throughput in such setting, and then develop oblivious\nscheduling algorithms that have low complexity and can achieve at least 1/2 and\n2/3 of the maximum throughput, without the knowledge of traffic or resource\nrequirement distribution. Extensive simulation results, using both synthetic\nand real traffic traces, are presented to verify the performance of our\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 20:17:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-21"}

Therefore, the concept of a hybrid ac-dc\nmicrogrid was emerged because of this contradiction. Hybrid ac-dc microgrid was\nintroduced in order to exploit the benefits of both ac and dc microgrids.\nHowever, the combination of both ac and dc microgrids will add more complexity\nto the network.

Recently, however, we have shown that {\\psi}* may be\ncorrelated with the fraction of cool atomic gas, as traced through the 21-cm\nabsorption of HI. This is expected since star formation requires cold (T ~ 10\nK) gas and so this could address the issue of why the star formation rate\ndensity does not trace the bulk atomic gas. The data are, however, limited to\nredshifts of z < 2, where both {\\psi}* and the cold gas fraction exhibit a\nsimilar steep climb from the present day (z = 0), and so it is unknown whether\nthe cold gas fraction follows the same decline as {\\psi}* at higher redshift.\nIn order to address this, we have used unpublished archival observations of\n21-cm absorption in high redshift damped Lyman-{\\alpha} absorption systems to\nincrease the sample at z > 2.

To (re)construct this function, numerous calibration\nmethods have been suggested involving steps of interpolation and extrapolation,\nmost often of parametric form and with point-estimate representations. We look\nat the calibration problem in a probabilistic framework with a nonparametric\napproach based on a Gaussian process prior.

To overcome such barriers, we\nintroduce a new, simple construction procedure that guarantees perfect\nhyperuniformity for very large sample sizes.

Our methodology enables a\nremarkable mapping that converts a very large nonhyperuniform disordered\ndispersion into a perfectly hyperuniform one, which we numerically demonstrate\nin two and three dimensions. A similar analysis also establishes the\nhyperuniformity of the famous Hashin-Shtrikman multiscale dispersions, which\npossess optimal transport and elastic properties. Our hyperuniform designs can\nbe readily fabricated using modern photolithographic and 3D printing\ntechnologies.

An important idea for the success of these methods is to exploit\nthe recurrence of similar patches in an input image to estimate the underlying\nimage structures. However, in these algorithms, the similar patches used for\ndenoising are obtained via Nearest Neighbour Search (NNS) and are sometimes not\noptimal. First, due to the existence of noise, NNS can select similar patches\nwith similar noise patterns to the reference patch. Second, the unreliable\nnoisy pixels in digital images can bring a bias to the patch searching process\nand result in a loss of color fidelity in the final denoising result. We\nobserve that given a set of good similar patches, their distribution is not\nnecessarily centered at the noisy reference patch and can be approximated by a\nGaussian component. Based on this observation, we present a patch searching\nmethod that clusters similar patch candidates into patch groups using Gaussian\nMixture Model-based clustering, and selects the patch group that contains the\nreference patch as the final patches for denoising.

To\nanswer the question if the observation of GW170817, GRB170817A, and AT2017gfo\ncould be explained by the merger of a neutron star with a black hole, we\nperform a joint multi-messenger analysis of the gravitational waves, the short\ngamma-ray burst, and the kilonova.

This assumption is often made\nfor mathematical convenience, since it enables SGD to be analyzed as a\nstochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by a Brownian motion. We argue\nthat the Gaussianity assumption might fail to hold in deep learning settings\nand hence render the Brownian motion-based analyses inappropriate. Inspired by\nnon-Gaussian natural phenomena, we consider the GN in a more general context\nand invoke the generalized CLT (GCLT), which suggests that the GN converges to\na heavy-tailed $\\alpha$-stable random variable. Accordingly, we propose to\nanalyze SGD as an SDE driven by a L\\'{e}vy motion. Such SDEs can incur `jumps',\nwhich force the SDE transition from narrow minima to wider minima, as proven by\nexisting metastability theory. To validate the $\\alpha$-stable assumption, we\nconduct extensive experiments on common deep learning architectures and show\nthat in all settings, the GN is highly non-Gaussian and admits heavy-tails. We\nfurther investigate the tail behavior in varying network architectures and\nsizes, loss functions, and datasets.

In this paper,\nwe present a solution to the inherent problems of churn prediction, using the\nconcept of Transfer Learning (TL) and Ensemble-based Meta-Classification. The\nproposed method TL-DeepE is applied in two stages. The first stage employs TL\nby fine-tuning multiple pre-trained Deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs).\nTelecom datasets are normally in vector form, which is converted into 2D images\nbecause Deep CNNs have high learning capacity on images. In the second stage,\npredictions from these Deep CNNs are appended to the original feature vector\nand thus are used to build a final feature vector for the high-level Genetic\nProgramming (GP) and AdaBoost based ensemble classifier. Thus, the experiments\nare conducted using various CNNs as base classifiers and the GP-AdaBoost as a\nmeta-classifier. By using 10-fold cross-validation, the performance of the\nproposed TL-DeepE system is compared with existing techniques, for two standard\ntelecommunication datasets; Orange and Cell2cell.

State-of-the-art methods for biomedical relation\nextraction are primarily based on supervised machine learning and therefore\ndepend on (sufficient) labeled data.

The\ntranslation is enabled by using MONA, a powerful tool for symbolic, BDD-based,\nDFA construction from logic specifications. Recent works used a first-order\nencoding of LTLf formulas to translate LTLf to First Order Logic (FOL), which\nis then fed to MONA to get the symbolic DFA. This encoding was shown to perform\nwell, but other encodings have not been studied. Specifically, the natural\nquestion of whether second-order encoding, which has significantly simpler\nquantificational structure, can outperform first-order encoding remained open.\n  In this paper we address this challenge and study second-order encodings for\nLTLf formulas. We first introduce a specific MSO encoding that captures the\nsemantics of LTLf in a natural way and prove its correctness. We then explore\nis a Compact MSO encoding, which benefits from automata-theoretic minimization,\nthus suggesting a possible practical advantage. To that end, we propose a\nformalization of symbolic DFA in second-order logic, thus developing a novel\nconnection between BDDs and MSO. We then show by empirical evaluations that the\nfirst-order encoding does perform better than both second-order encodings. The\nconclusion is that first-order encoding is a better choice than second-order\nencoding in LTLf-to-Automata translation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 07:18:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-21"}

Here, we study a\ndistinct sRNA-driven FFL (sFFL) discovered recently in Salmonella enterica.\nUnlike previously studied transcriptional FFLs (tFFL) and sRNA-mediated FFLs\n(smFFL), here the upstream regulator is an sRNA that activates the target\nprotein and its transcriptional activator. Such sFFL has not been subjected to\nrigorous analysis. We, therefore, set out to understand two aspects. First is a\nquantitative comparison of the regulatory response of sFFL with tFFL and smFFL\nusing a differential equation framework. Since the process of gene expression\nis inherently stochastic, the second objective is to find how the noise affects\nthe functionality of sFFL. We find the response of sFFLto be stronger, faster,\nand more sensitive to the initial concentration of the upstream regulator than\ntFFL and smFFL. Further, a generating function based analysis and stochastic\nsimulations lead to a non-trivial prediction that an optimal noise filtration\ncan be attained depending on the synthesis rate of the sRNA and the degradation\nrate of the transcriptional activator. We conclude that in sFFL, sRNA plays a\ncritical role not only in driving a rapid and strong response, but also a\nreliable response that depends critically on its concentration. Given the\nadvantages of sFFL brought out in this work, it should not be surprising if\nfuture work reveals their employment in different biological contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 07:27:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 07:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-20"}

The region at the loop boundary where the\nshearing motions are greatest is treated as a straight interface separating\ntime-periodic counter-streaming flows. In order to consider a twisted tube, the\nmagnetic field at one side of the interface is inclined.

The new development reveals the\nshortcomings of the linearized theory, in particular, its inability to describe\nkinematically confined surface growth and to account for growth-induced elastic\ninstabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 11:09:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

This version features a new ocean basin geometry with periodic boundary\nconditions in the zonal direction. The analysis presented in this paper\nconsiders a low-order version of the model with 40 dynamical variables.\n  First the increase of surface friction (and the associated heat flux) with\nthe ocean can either induce chaos when the aspect ratio between the meridional\nand zonal directions of the domain of integration is small, or suppress chaos\nwhen it is large. This reflects the potentially counter-intuitive role that the\nocean can play in the coupled dynamics.\n  Second, and perhaps more importantly, the emergence of long-term\npredictability within the atmosphere for specific values of the friction\ncoefficient occurs through intermittent excursions in the vicinity of a\n(long-period) unstable periodic solution. Once close to this solution the\nsystem is predictable for long times, i.e. a few years. The intermittent\ntransition close to this orbit is, however, erratic and probably hard to\npredict.\n  This new route to long-term predictability contrasts with the one found in\nthe closed ocean-basin low-order version of MAOOAM, in which the chaotic\nsolution is permanently wandering in the vicinity of an unstable periodic orbit\nfor specific values of the friction coefficient. The model solution is thus at\nany time influenced by the unstable periodic orbit and inherits from its\nlong-term predictability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 12:33:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Jul 2019 20:40:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

In a recent\npaper of ours, a fully covariant general relativistic (GR) calculation was\npresented on the Earth's gravitational modification effect in such mixed\nmagnetic-electric frozen spin storage ring on the spin transport, which could\ncontribute to such measurement. It was shown that similarly to an EDM signal,\nGR causes a spin precession out of the orbital plane, under the frozen spin\ncondition. The rate of the vertical polarization buildup is predicted to be\n-a*beta*gamma*g/c, where g is the gravitational acceleration on the surface of\nthe Earth, c is the speed of light, beta*gamma is the particle momentum over\nmass, and 'a' is its magnetic moment anomaly.

This paper mainly addresses\nthe experimental perspectives to detect this effect in a realistic frozen spin\nstorage ring configuration. Such a measurement would provide a novel test of\nGR, sampling the tensorial nature of GR at a microscopic level, as acting on\nthe spin vector of elementary particles. The conclusion is that the pertinent\nGR experiment seems to be realistic with large magnetic moment anomaly\nparticles, such as tritons, helion3 or protons, whereas it is not realistic\nwith small magnetic moment anomaly particles, such as deuterons, muons or\nelectrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 13:19:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

For the case of long symbol duration, the achievable\nrate under on-off keying modulation is investigated based on Kullback-Leibler\n(KL) divergence and Chernoff $\\alpha$-divergence. We prove the tightness of the\nderived bounds for large peak power with zero background radiation with\nexponential convergence rate, and for low peak power of order two convergence\nrate. For large peak power with fixed background radiation and low background\nradiation with fixed peak power, the proposed bound gap is a small positive\nvalue for low background radiation and large peak power, respectively.\nMoreover, we propose an approximation on the achievable rate in the low\nbackground radiation and long symbol duration regime, which is more accurate\ncompared with the derived upper and lower bounds in the medium signal to noise\nratio (SNR) regime. For the symbol duration that can be sufficiently small, the\ncapacity and the optimal duty cycle are is investigated. We show that the\ncapacity approaches that of continuous Poisson capacity as $T_s=\\tau\\to0$. The\nasymptotic capacity is analyzed for low and large peak power. Compared with the\ncontinuous Poisson capacity, the capacity of a non-perfect receiver is almost\nlossless and loss with attenuation for low peak power given zero background\nradiation and nonzero background radiation, respectively.

The above theoretical results are\nextensively validated by numerical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 13:21:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 16:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

In the Direct Product Testing\nProblem, we are given a function $F:V\\to \\{0,1\\}^k$, and our goal is to test\nwhether $F$ is close to a direct product encoding, i.e., whether there exists\nsome $a\\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ such that on most sets $S$, we have $F(S)=$DP$_V(a)(S)$.\nA natural test is as follows: select a pair $(S,S')\\in V$ according to some\nunderlying distribution over $V\\times V$, query $F$ on this pair, and check for\nconsistency on their intersection. Note that the above distribution may be\nviewed as a weighted graph over the vertex set $V$ and is referred to as a test\ngraph. The testability of direct products was studied over various specific\ndomains and test graphs (for example see Dinur-Steurer [CCC'14]; Dinur-Kaufman\n[FOCS'17]). In this paper, we study the testability of direct products in a\ngeneral setting, addressing the question: what properties of the domain and the\ntest graph allow one to prove a direct product testing theorem? Towards this\ngoal we introduce the notion of coordinate expansion of a test graph. Roughly\nspeaking a test graph is a coordinate expander if it has global and local\nexpansion, and has certain nice intersection properties on sampling. We show\nthat whenever the test graph has coordinate expansion then it admits a direct\nproduct testing theorem. Additionally, for every $k$ and $n$ we provide a\ndirect product domain $V\\subseteq \\binom{n}{k}$ of size $n$, called the Sliding\nWindow domain for which we prove direct product testability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 13:25:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-21"}

As a sequel of Paper I, here we present further observational\nevidence that lend support to these earlier proposals with the velocity\ncoordinate spectrum analysis (Lazarian & Pogosyan 2006). We recover the\nturbulent energy spectra of HCN and HCO+(4-3) in a starless molecular filament\nin NGC 6334 where magnetic fields play a dynamically important role (Li et al.\n2015). Our analysis showed that the neutral spectrum is consistent with\nKolmogorov-type (k^-5/3, where k is the wave number), while that of the ions is\nthe same on the large scale but steeper (k^-2) for scales smaller than 0.404pc.\nWe carefully ruled out the possibilities that the spectrum difference can stem\nfrom the differences of ion and neutral optical depth and hyper-fine\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 15:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-21"}

The widespread use of GP\nis due to its flexible and comprehensible tree-type structure. Similarly,\nresearch is also gaining momentum in the field of Image Processing, because of\nits promising results over vast areas of applications ranging from medical\nImage Processing to multispectral imaging. Image Processing is mainly involved\nin applications such as computer vision, pattern recognition, image\ncompression, storage, and medical diagnostics. This universal nature of images\nand their associated algorithm, i.e., complexities, gave an impetus to the\nexploration of GP. GP has thus been used in different ways for Image Processing\nsince its inception. Many interesting GP techniques have been developed and\nemployed in the field of Image Processing, and consequently, we aim to provide\nthe research community an extensive view of these techniques. This survey thus\npresents the diverse applications of GP in Image Processing and provides useful\nresources for further research. Also, the comparison of different parameters\nused in different applications of Image Processing is summarized in tabular\nform. Moreover, analysis of the different parameters used in Image Processing\nrelated tasks is carried-out to save the time needed in the future for\nevaluating the parameters of GP. As more advancement is made in GP\nmethodologies, its success in solving complex tasks, not only in Image\nProcessing but also in other fields, may increase. Additionally, guidelines are\nprovided for applying GP in Image Processing related tasks, the pros and cons\nof GP techniques are discussed, and some future directions are also set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 14:12:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 09:22:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 20:42:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-29"}

Solving these systems along the full disease\ntrajectory is usually challenging, due to the lack of a well defined time axis\nfor the pathology. This issue is addressed by disease progression models (DPM)\nwhere long-term progression trajectories are estimated via time\nreparametrization of individual observations. However, due to their loose\nassumptions on the dynamics, DPM do not provide insights on the bio-mechanical\nproperties of MP propagation.

The model consists of a transmission problem for cell volume\nfraction complemented with continuity of stresses and mass flux across the\nsurfaces of the membranes. We reduce the original problem to a limiting\ntransmission problem whereby each thin membrane is replaced by an effective\ninterface, and we develop a formal asymptotic method that enables the\nderivation of a set of biophysically consistent transmission conditions to\nclose the limiting problem. The formal results obtained are validated via\nnumerical simulations showing that the relative error between the solutions to\nthe original transmission problem and the solutions to the limiting problem\nvanishes when the thickness of the membranes tends to zero. In order to show\npotential applications of our effective interface conditions, we employ the\nlimiting transmission problem to model cancer cell invasion through the\nbasement membrane and the metastatic spread of ovarian carcinoma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 12:04:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Feb 2019 17:42:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 15:49:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 4 Aug 2019 12:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}

Twelve different equations of state are used to describe the nuclear\nstructure. We find four fitting relations which connect the rotating frequency,\nmass and radius of stars in the mass-shedding limit to the mass and radius of\nstars in the static sequence. We show the breakdown of approximate relation for\nthe Keplerian frequency derived by Lattimer and Prakash [Science, 304, 536,\n(2004)] and then we present a new, EOS-independent and more accurate relation.\nThis relation fits the Keplerian frequency of rotating neutron stars to about\n$2\\%$ for a large range of the compactness $M_{S}/R_{S}$ of the reference\nnon-rotating neutron star, namely the static star with the same central density\nas the rotating one. The performance of the fitting formula is close to $4\\%$\nfor $M_{S}/R_{S}\\leq 0.05~M_{\\odot}$/km ($f_{K}\\leq 350$~Hz). We present\nadditional EOS-independent relations for the Keplerian sequence including\nrelations for $M_{K}f_{K}$ and $R_{K}f_{K}$ in terms of $M_{S}f_{S}$ and\n$R_{S}f_{S}$, respectively, one of $M_K/R_K$ as a function of $f_{K}/f_{S}$ and\n$M_S/R_S$, and a relation between the $M_K$, $R_K$ and $f_K$. These new fitting\nrelations are approximately EOS-independent with an error in the worst case of\n$8\\%$.

DFP identifies a device using information from the packets which the\ndevice uses to communicate over the network. Packets are received at a router\nand processed to extract the information. In this paper, we worked on the DFP\nusing Inter Arrival Time (IAT). IAT is the time interval between the two\nconsecutive packets received. This has been observed that the IAT is unique for\na device because of different hardware and the software used for the device.\nThe existing work on the DFP uses the statistical techniques to analyze the IAT\nand to further generate the information using which a device can be identified\nuniquely. This work presents a novel idea of DFP by plotting graphs of IAT for\npackets with each graph plotting 100 IATs and subsequently processing the\nresulting graphs for the identification of the device. This approach improves\nthe efficiency to identify a device DFP due to achieved benchmark of the deep\nlearning libraries in the image processing. We configured Raspberry Pi to work\nas a router and installed our packet sniffer application on the Raspberry Pi .\nThe packet sniffer application captured the packet information from the\nconnected devices in a log file.

In this\npaper, considering effects of pointing error and atmospheric turbulence, two\noptimization models are presented on FSO communication system. In Model 1, the\nnormalized transmitter power is objective function, Bit Error Rate (BER) is\nequality subjective. In Model 2 normalized transmitter power is equality\nsubjective, the BER is objective function. In both of them the normalized\nwavelength is variable parameter. These models were previously investigated\nusing numerical methods; in the sense that they were solved asymptotically.\nFrom this point of view, this paper regenerated these models and solved them by\na completely different analytical method, and derived a new exact solution.\nComparing exact and asymptotic methods shows some interesting results; the\nasymptotic method achieves BER=10^(-9), but the presented new exact method\nachieves BER=10^(-13), which is a significant difference. It means that even at\nthe worst case scenario such as pointing error, it is possible to have a very\ngood performance by only the transmitting wavelength a bit.
