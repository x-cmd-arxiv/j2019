Accordingly, three\nnon-convex network utility maximization problems are formulated to slice\nspectrum among BSs, allocate spectrum among autonomous vehicles (AVs)\nassociated with a BS, and control transmit powers of BSs, respectively. Via\nlinear programming relaxation and first-order Taylor series approximation,\nthese problems are transformed into tractable forms and then are jointly solved\nthrough an alternate concave search (ACS) algorithm.

Full CT reconstruction\nfrom a fraction of the detected photons required by scintillation-based\ndetectors has been demonstrated. Current efforts in photon-counting CT have\nfocused mainly on reconstruction techniques. In medical and industrial x-ray\ncomputed tomography (CT) applications, truncated projection from the\nregion-of-interest (ROI) is another effective way of dose reduction, as\ninformation from the ROI is usually sufficient for diagnostic purpose.\nProjection truncation poses an ill-conditioned inverse problem, which can be\nimproved by including projections from the exterior region.

These services are fueled by emerging\napplications that require rapidly injecting data streams and computing updated\nanalytics results in real-time. In many of such applications, the computing\nresources are often shared for processing both updates from information sources\nand queries from end users. This requires joint scheduling of updates and\nqueries because the service provider needs to make a critical decision upon\nreceiving a user query: either it responds immediately with currently available\nbut possibly stale information, or it first processes new updates and then\nresponds with fresher information. Hence, the tradeoff between service\nperformance and information freshness naturally arises in this context. To that\nend, we propose a simple single-server two-queue model that captures the\ncoupled scheduling of updates and queries and aim to design scheduling policies\nthat can properly address the important tradeoff between performance and\nfreshness. Specifically, we consider the response time as a performance metric\nand the Age of Information (AoI) as a freshness metric. After demonstrating the\nlimitations of the simplest FCFS policy, we propose two threshold-based\npolicies: the Query-k policy that prioritizes queries and the Update-k policy\nthat prioritizes updates. Then, we rigorously analyze both the response time\nand the Peak AoI (PAoI) of the threshold-based policies. Further, we propose\nthe Joint-(M,N) policy, which allows flexibly prioritizing updates or queries\nthrough choosing different values of two thresholds M and N. Finally, we\nconduct simulations to evaluate the response time and the PAoI of the proposed\npolicies. The results show that our proposed threshold-based policies can\neffectively control the balance between performance and freshness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 17:28:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 21:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

We then introduce a novel analog scheme, called A-DSGD,\nwhich exploits the additive nature of the wireless MAC for over-the-air\ngradient computation, and provide convergence analysis for this approach. In\nA-DSGD, the devices first sparsify their gradient estimates, and then project\nthem to a lower dimensional space imposed by the available channel bandwidth.\nThese projections are sent directly over the MAC without employing any digital\ncode. Numerical results show that A-DSGD converges faster than D-DSGD thanks to\nits more efficient use of the limited bandwidth and the natural alignment of\nthe gradient estimates over the channel.

Since the evolution can be described by a planar flow in the normal\nplane, we derive most of our results in the context of a toy model for planar\nfluid flow. We then generalize our results to include the effects of field-line\ncurvature. We show that the type of flow is determined by the two non-zero\neigenvalues of the gradient of the normalized magnetic field. The eigenvalue\ndifference quantifies the local rate of squeezing or coiling of neighboring\nfield lines, which we relate to standard notions of fluid vorticity and shear.\nThe resulting squeezing rate can be used in the detection of null points,\nhyperbolic flux tubes and current sheets. Once integrated along field lines,\nthat rate gives a squeeze factor, which is an approximation to the squashing\nfactor, which is usually employed in locating quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs),\nwhich are possible sites for magnetic reconnection. Unlike the squeeze factor,\nthe squashing factor can miss QSLs for which field lines are squeezed and then\nunsqueezed. In that regard, the squeeze factor is a better proxy for locating\nQSLs than the squashing factor. In another application of our analysis, we\nconstruct an approximation to the local rate of twist of neighboring field\nlines, which we refer to as the coiling rate.

Understanding the progenitors and the\nmechanism driving SN Ic-bl explosions vs those of their SNe Ic cousins is key\nto understanding the SN-GRB relationship and jet production in massive stars.\nHere we present the largest set of host-galaxy spectra of 28 SNe Ic and 14 SN\nIc-bl, all discovered before 2013 by the same untargeted survey, namely the\nPalomar Transient Factory (PTF). We carefully measure their gas-phase\nmetallicities, stellar masses (M*s) and star-formation rates (SFRs) by taking\ninto account recent progress in the metallicity field and propagating\nuncertainties correctly. We further re-analyze the hosts of 10 literature\nSN-GRBs using the same methods and compare them to our PTF SN hosts with the\ngoal of constraining their progenitors from their local environments by\nconducting a thorough statistical comparison, including upper limits. We find\nthat the metallicities, SFRs and M*s of our PTF SN Ic-bl hosts are\nstatistically comparable to those of SN-GRBs, but significantly lower than\nthose of the PTF SNe Ic. The mass-metallicity relations as defined by the SNe\nIc-bl and SN-GRBs are not significantly different from the same relations as\ndefined by the SDSS galaxies, in contrast to claims by earlier works. Our\nfindings point towards low metallicity as a crucial ingredient for SN Ic-bl and\nSN-GRB production since we are able to break the degeneracy between high SFR\nand low metallicity.

To better understand this,\nsubspace match was recently proposed as a method for assessing the similarity\nof the representations learned by neural networks. It has been shown that two\nnetworks with the same architecture trained from different initializations\nlearn representations that at hidden layers show low similarity when assessed\nwith subspace match, even when the output layers show high similarity and the\nnetworks largely exhibit similar performance on classification tasks. In this\nnote, we present a simple example motivated by standard results in commutative\nalgebra to illustrate how this can happen, and show that although the subspace\nmatch at a hidden layer may be 0, the representations learned may be isomorphic\nas vector spaces. This leads us to conclude that a subspace match comparison of\nlearned representations may well be uninformative, and it points to the need\nfor better methods of understanding learned representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 19:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-07"}

To do so, we identified and characterized the young stellar\npopulation associated with the region using homogeneous infra-red data-sets\nobtained from 2MASS, GLIMPSE, MIPS and WISE surveys. We make stellar surface\ndensity and minimum spanning tree maps to identify young clusters, and use {\\it\nSpitzer} images to identify irradiated structures, such as elephant trunk-like\nstructures (ETLSs) and pillars in the region. The surface density distribution\nof the young stellar objects (YSOs) reveals three new clusterings and $\\sim$\n50\\% distributed protostars in the H{\\sc ii} region.

TbMnO3 is a\nparadigmatic material in which two electromagnons have been observed in the\ncycloidal magnetic phase. However, their observation in TbMnO3 is restricted to\nthe cycloidal spin phase and magnetic ground states that can support the\nelectromagnon excitation are still under debate. Here, we show by performing\nRaman spectroscopy measurements under pressure that the lower-energy\nelectromagnon (4 meV) disappears when the ground state enters from a cycloidal\nphase to an antiferromagnetic phase (E-type). On the contrary, the\nmagnetoelectric activity of the higher-energy electromagnon (8 meV) increases\nin intensity by one order of magnitude. Using microscopic model calculations,\nwe demonstrate that the lowerenergy electromagnon, observed in the cycloidal\nphase, originates from a higher harmonic of the magnetic cycloid, and we\ndetermine that the symmetric exchange-striction mechanism is at the origin of\nthe higher-energy electromagnon which survives even in the E-type phase. The\ncolossal enhancement of the electromagnon activity in TbMnO3 paves the way to\nuse multiferroics more efficiently for generation, conversion and control of\nspin waves in magnonic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 21:43:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-07"}

Specifically, LAT transforms an\nimage from the intensity domain to the local area domain, which is invariant\nunder nonlinear intensity deformations, especially radiometric, photometric,\nand spectral deformations. In addition, robust feature descriptors are\nreformulated with LAT for several practical applications. Furthermore,\nLAT-convolution layer and Aception block are proposed and, with these novel\ncomponents, deep neural network called LAT-Net is proposed especially for scene\nrecognition task.

We\ncalculate the constraints that can be placed by saturating the current\n$1\\sigma$ bounds on single post-Keplerian parameters, as well as employing\nBayesian methods through Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo simulations to explore the\nconstraints that can be achieved when one considers all measured parameters\nsimultaneously. Our results demonstrate that both methods are able to place\nsimilar constraints and that they are both indeed dominated by the measurements\nof the orbital period decay. The Bayesian approach, however, allows one to\nsimultaneously explore the posterior distributions of not only the theory\nparameters but of the masses as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 23:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

Neural representations vary drastically across the first\nstages of visual processing: at the output of the retina, ganglion cell\nreceptive fields (RFs) exhibit a clear antagonistic center-surround structure,\nwhereas in the primary visual cortex, typical RFs are sharply tuned to a\nprecise orientation. There is currently no unified theory explaining these\ndifferences in representations across layers. Here, using a deep convolutional\nneural network trained on image recognition as a model of the visual system, we\nshow that such differences in representation can emerge as a direct consequence\nof different neural resource constraints on the retinal and cortical networks,\nand we find a single model from which both geometries spontaneously emerge at\nthe appropriate stages of visual processing. The key constraint is a reduced\nnumber of neurons at the retinal output, consistent with the anatomy of the\noptic nerve as a stringent bottleneck. Second, we find that, for simple\ncortical networks, visual representations at the retinal output emerge as\nnonlinear and lossy feature detectors, whereas they emerge as linear and\nfaithful encoders of the visual scene for more complex cortices. This result\npredicts that the retinas of small vertebrates should perform sophisticated\nnonlinear computations, extracting features directly relevant to behavior,\nwhereas retinas of large animals such as primates should mostly encode the\nvisual scene linearly and respond to a much broader range of stimuli. These\npredictions could reconcile the two seemingly incompatible views of the retina\nas either performing feature extraction or efficient coding of natural scenes,\nby suggesting that all vertebrates lie on a spectrum between these two\nobjectives, depending on the degree of neural resources allocated to their\nvisual system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 23:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-07"}

However, the innetwork\nfiltering primitive can also be misused. Transit networks can use the\nin-network filtering service as an excuse for any arbitrary packet drops made\nfor their own benefit. For example, transit networks may intentionally execute\nfiltering services poorly or unfairly to discriminate their competing neighbor\nASes while claiming that they drop packets for the sake of DDoS defense. We\nargue that it is due to the lack of verifiable filtering - i.e., no one can\ncheck if a transit network executes the filter rules correctly as requested by\nthe DDoS victims. To make in-network filtering a more robust defense primitive,\nin this paper, we propose a verifiable in-network filtering, called VIF, that\nexploits emerging hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) and\noffers filtering verifiability to DDoS victims and neighbor ASes. Our proof of\nconcept demonstrates that a VIF filter implementation on commodity servers with\nTEE support can handle traffic at line rate (e.g., 10 Gb/s) and execute up to\n3,000 filter rules. We show that VIF can easily scale to handle larger traffic\nvolume (e.g., 500 Gb/s) and more complex filtering operations (e.g., 150,000\nfilter rules) by parallelizing the TEE-based filters.

We then use the resonator to experimentally determine the\npermittivity of a number of different materials. First, the compact and high-Q\nresonator is used to measure both the real and imaginary parts of the complex\npermittivity of methyl alcohol at 185 MHz. Second, the resonator was placed\ninside a vacuum-tight Dewar. We measured the resonance frequency with the\nresonator suspended in vacuum and then immersed in an atmosphere of air. From\nthese data, the dielectric constant of air was accurately determined. Next, the\nresonator was submerged in liquid nitrogen and the boiling temperature of the\nnitrogen bath was manipulated by regulating its vapor pressure. This system\nallowed for a precise measurement of the dielectric constant of liquid nitrogen\nover a temperature range of 64 to 77 K.

Scaling DNN computations\nto larger clusters is generally done by distributing tasks in batch mode using\nmethods such as distributed synchronous SGD. Among the issues with this\napproach is that to make the distributed cluster work with high utilization,\nthe workload distributed to each node must be large, which implies nontrivial\ngrowth in the SGD mini-batch size.\n  In this paper, we propose a framework called FPDeep, which uses a hybrid of\nmodel and layer parallelism to configure distributed reconfigurable clusters to\ntrain DNNs. This approach has numerous benefits. First, the design does not\nsuffer from batch size growth. Second, novel workload and weight partitioning\nleads to balanced loads of both among nodes.

Typical\nchallenges arising in smart city scenarios include variations of viewpoints,\nillumination and self occlusions.

Thus, we investigate thermodynamic and dynamical\nconsequences by integrating the speed of sound to obtain the pressure in terms\nof the density, leading to an extended version of the Anton-Schmidt cosmic\nfluids. Within this picture, we get significant outcomes expanding the\nAnton-Schmidt pressure in the infrared regime. The low-energy case becomes\nrelevant for the universe to accelerate without any cosmological constant. We\ntherefore derive the effective representation of our fluid in terms of a\nLagrangian $\\mathcal{L}=\\mathcal{L}(X)$, depending on the kinetic term $X$\nonly. We analyze both the relativistic and non-relativistic limits. In the\nnon-relativistic limit we construct both the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian in\nterms of density $\\rho$ and scalar field $\\vartheta$, whereas in the\nrelativistic case no analytical expression for the Lagrangian can be found.\nThus, we obtain the potential as a function of $\\rho$, under the hypothesis of\nirrotational perfect fluid. We demonstrate that the model represents a natural\ngeneralization of \\emph{logotropic dark energy models}. Finally, we analyze an\nextended class of generalized Chaplygin gas models with one extra parameter\n$\\beta$. Interestingly, we find that the Lagrangians of this scenario and the\npure logotropic one coincide in the non-relativistic regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2019 09:42:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

To develop a\ntherapy, it is essential to understand the connectivity of biochemical units\nand the internal working mechanisms of the target network. A network is mainly\ncharacterized by its topology and internal dynamics. In particular, sparse\ntopology and stable system dynamics are fundamental properties of many\nreal-world networks. In recent years, kernel-based methods have been popular in\nthe system identification community. By incorporating empirical Bayes, this\nframework, which we call KEB, is able to promote system stability and impose\nsparse network topology. Nevertheless, KEB may not be ideal for topology\ndetection due to local optima and numerical errors. Here, therefore, we propose\nan alternative, data-driven, method that is designed to greatly improve\ninference accuracy, compared with KEB. The proposed method uses dynamical\nstructure functions to describe networks so that the information of\nunmeasurable nodes is encoded in the model. A powerful numerical sampling\nmethod, namely reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC), is applied to\nexplore full Bayesian models effectively. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that\nour approach produces more accurate networks compared with KEB methods.\nFurthermore, simulations of a synthetic biological network demonstrate that the\nperformance of the proposed method is superior to that of the state-of-the-art\nmethod, namely iCheMA.

These programs\nhave accumulated daily images of the solar photosphere and chromosphere taken\nat various spectral bands over a time span greater than 80 years. In the last\ntwo decades, regular solar observations were continued with digital cameras\nonly at the Catania and Rome Observatories, which are now part of the INAF\nNational Institute for Astrophysics.

The dynamic free energy at any mean location involves contributions\nfrom two adjacent layers where confining forces are not the same. At the most\nfundamental level of the theory, the caging component of the dynamic free\nenergy varies essentially exponentially with distance from the interface,\nsaturating deep enough into the film with a correlation length of modest size\nand weak sensitivity to thermodynamic state.

We present enforcement mechanisms that are based on type\nand effect systems, ranging from purely static mechanisms to hybrid\ncombinations with dynamic migration control, for enforcing the above properties\non an expressive ML-like language with concurrent threads and code migration,\nand which includes an allowed flow policy construct that dynamically tests the\nallowed flow policy of the current context. Finally, we show that the\ncombination of the above two properties guarantees that actual information\nflows do not violate the relevant allowed flow policies. To this end we propose\nand use the Distributed Non-Interference property, a natural generalization of\nNon-Interference to a distributed security setting that ensures that\ninformation flows in a program respect the allowed flow policy of the domains\nwhere they originate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2019 14:16:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jan 2019 23:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

Under ideal circumstances, the oscillation frequency of the\npendulum is independent of its mass and swing amplitude. However, in most\nreal-world situations, the dynamics of pendulums is not quite so simple,\nparticularly with additional interactions between the pendulum and a\nsurrounding fluid. Here we extend the realm of pendulum studies to include\nlarge amplitude oscillations of heavy and buoyant pendulums in a fluid. We\nperformed experiments with massive and hollow cylindrical pendulums in water,\nand constructed a simple model that takes the buoyancy, added mass, fluid\n(nonlinear) drag, and bearing friction into account. To first order, the model\npredicts the oscillation frequencies, peak decelerations and damping rate well.\nAn interesting effect of the nonlinear drag captured well by the model is that\nfor heavy pendulums, the damping time shows a non-monotonic dependence on\npendulum mass, reaching a minimum when the pendulum mass density is nearly\ntwice that of the fluid. Small deviations from the model's predictions are\nseen, particularly in the second and subsequent maxima of oscillations. Using\nTime- Resolved Particle Image Velocimetry (TR-PIV), we reveal that these\ndeviations likely arise due to the disturbed flow created by the pendulum at\nearlier times. The mean wake velocity obtained from PIV is used to model an\nextra drag term due to incoming wake flow. The revised model significantly\nimproves the predictions for the second and subsequent oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2019 14:18:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Most of the existing fuzzers consider\nall parts of a software equally, and pay too much attention on how to improve\nthe code coverage. It is inefficient as the vulnerable code only takes a tiny\nfraction of the entire code. In this paper, we design and implement a\nvulnerability-oriented evolutionary fuzzing prototype named V-Fuzz, which aims\nto find bugs efficiently and quickly in a limited time. V-Fuzz consists of two\nmain components: a neural network-based vulnerability prediction model and a\nvulnerability-oriented evolutionary fuzzer. Given a binary program to V-Fuzz,\nthe vulnerability prediction model will give a prior estimation on which parts\nof the software are more likely to be vulnerable. Then, the fuzzer leverages an\nevolutionary algorithm to generate inputs which tend to arrive at the\nvulnerable locations, guided by the vulnerability prediction result.\nExperimental results demonstrate that V-Fuzz can find bugs more efficiently\nthan state-of-the-art fuzzers. Moreover, V-Fuzz has discovered 10 CVEs, and 3\nof them are newly discovered. We reported the new CVEs, and they have been\nconfirmed and fixed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2019 14:40:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-07"}

In the physical space, velocity\ndistribution function is approximated by the piecewise polynomials of degree up\nto 4, while in the velocity space the fast spectral method is incorporated into\nthe DG to evaluate the collision operator. A specific polynomial approximation\nfor the collision operator is proposed to reduce the computational complexity\nof the fast spectral method by $K$ times, where for two-dimensional problems\n$K$ is 15 when DG with 4th-order polynomials are used on triangular mesh. Based\non the first-order upwind scheme, a sweeping technique is employed to solve the\nlocal linear equations resulting from the DG discretization sequentially over\nspatial elements. This technique can preserve stability of the scheme and\nrequires no nonlinear limiter in solving hypersonic rarefied gas flow when the\nflow is fully resolved. Moreover, without assembling large sparse linear\nsystem, the computational cost in terms of memory and CPU time can be\nsignificantly reduced. Five different one/two-dimensional tests including\nlow-speed microscale flows and hypersonic rarefied gas flows are used to verify\nthe proposed approach. Our results show that, DG schemes of different order of\napproximating polynomial require the same number of iterative steps to obtain\nthe steady-state solution with the same order of accuracy; and the higher order\nthe scheme, fewer spatial elements thus less CPU time is needed. Besides, our\nmethod can be faster than the finite difference solver by about one order of\nmagnitude. The produced solutions can be used as benchmark data for assessing\nthe accuracy of other gas kinetic solvers for the Boltzmann equation and gas\nkinetic models that simplify the Boltzmann collision operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2019 10:35:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

Here, we use permutation entropy and statistical complexity over\nsliding time-windows of price log returns to quantify the dynamic efficiency of\nmore than four hundred cryptocurrencies. We consider that a cryptocurrency is\nefficient within a time-window when these two complexity measures are\nstatistically indistinguishable from their values obtained on randomly shuffled\ndata. We find that 37% of the cryptocurrencies in our study stay efficient over\n80% of the time, whereas 20% are informationally efficient in less than 20% of\nthe time. Our results also show that the efficiency is not correlated with the\nmarket capitalization of the cryptocurrencies. A dynamic analysis of\ninformational efficiency over time reveals clustering patterns in which\ndifferent cryptocurrencies with similar temporal patterns form four clusters,\nand moreover, younger currencies in each group appear poised to follow the\ntrend of their 'elders'. The cryptocurrency market thus already shows notable\nadherence to the efficient market hypothesis, although data also reveals that\nthe coming-of-age of digital currencies is in this regard still very much\nunderway.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 23:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-06"}

The backbone of this study is a large set of\nprobabilistically-constructed \"identities\", represented as small bags of\ncookies and mobile ad identifiers with associated metadata, that are likely all\nowned by the same underlying user. The identity data allows to generate\n\"identity-based\", rather than \"identifier-based\", user models, giving a fuller\npicture of the interests of the users underlying the identifiers. We employ\noff-policy techniques to evaluate the potential of identity-powered lookalike\nmodels without incurring the risk of allowing untested models to direct large\namounts of ad spend or the large cost of performing A/B tests. We add to\nhistorical work on off-policy evaluation by noting a significant type of\n\"finite-sample bias\" that occurs for studies combining modestly-sized datasets\nand evaluation metrics involving rare events (e.g., conversions). We illustrate\nthis bias using a simulation study that later informs the handling of inverse\npropensity weights in our analyses on real data. We demonstrate significant\nlift in identity-powered lookalikes versus an identity-ignorant baseline: on\naverage ~70% lift in conversion rate. This rises to factors of ~(4-32)x for\nidentifiers having little data themselves, but that can be inferred to belong\nto users with substantial data to aggregate across identifiers. This implies\nthat identity-powered user modeling is especially important in the context of\nidentifiers having very short lifespans (i.e., frequently churned cookies). Our\nwork motivates and informs the use of probabilistically-constructed identities\nin marketing. It also deepens the canon of examples in which off-policy\nlearning has been employed to evaluate the complex systems of the internet\neconomy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2019 02:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

I3 can also be used as a field-normalized\nindicator. Field-normalization is common practice in bibliometrics, especially\nwhen institutions and countries are compared. Publication and citation\npractices are so different among fields that citation impact is normalized for\ncross-field comparisons. In this study, we test the ability of the indicator to\ndiscriminate between quality levels of papers as defined by Faculty members at\nF1000Prime. F1000Prime is a post-publication peer review system for assessing\npapers in the biomedical area. Thus, we test the convergent validity of I3 (in\nthis study, we test I3/N - the size-independent variant of I3 where I3 is\ndivided by the number of papers) using assessments by peers as baseline and\ncompare its validity with several other (field-normalized) indicators: the\nmean-normalized citation score (MNCS), relative-citation ratio (RCR), citation\nscore normalized by cited references (CSNCR), characteristic scores and scales\n(CSS), source-normalized citation score (SNCS), citation percentile, and\nproportion of papers which belong to the x% most frequently cited papers (PPtop\nx%). The results show that the PPtop 1% indicator discriminates best among\ndifferent quality levels. I3 performs similar as (slightly better than) most of\nthe other field-normalized indicators. Thus, the results point out that the\nindicator could be a valuable alternative to other indicators in bibliometrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2019 10:48:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 12:54:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-19"}

We cast the problem as a shepherding problem, similar\nto biological dogs guiding a group of sheep towards a goal. The shepherd needs\nto deal with complex and dynamic environments and make decisions in order to\ndirect the swarm from one location to another. In this paper, we design a novel\ncurriculum to teach an artificial intelligence empowered agent to shepherd in\nthe presence of the large state space associated with the shepherding problem\nand in a transparent manner. The results show that a properly designed\ncurriculum could indeed enhance the speed of learning and the complexity of\nlearnt behaviours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2019 00:04:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-25"}
