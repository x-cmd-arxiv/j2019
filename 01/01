Viewing each step of the worm construction as a\nposition increment (step) of a random walker, we demonstrate that the\npersistence exponent $\\theta$ and the dynamical exponent $z$ of this random\nwalk depend only on the universal power-law exponents of the underlying\ncritical phase, and not on the details of the worm algorithm or the microscopic\nHamiltonian. Further, we argue that the detailed balance criterion obeyed by\nsuch worm algorithms and the power-law correlations of the underlying\nequilibrium system together give rise to two related properties of this random\nwalk: First, the steps of the walk are expected to be power-law correlated in\ntime. Second, the position distribution of the walker relative to its starting\npoint is given by the equilibrium position distribution of a particle in an\nattractive logarithmic central potential of strength $\\eta_m$, where $\\eta_m$\nis the universal power-law exponent of the equilibrium defect-antidefect\ncorrelation function of the underlying spin system. We derive a scaling\nrelation, $z = (2-\\eta_m)/(1-\\theta)$, that allows us to express the dynamical\nexponent $z(\\eta_m)$ of this process in terms of its persistence exponent\n$\\theta(\\eta_m)$. Our measurements of $z(\\eta_m)$ and $\\theta(\\eta_m)$ are\nconsistent with this relation over a range of values of the universal\nequilibrium exponent $\\eta_m$, and yield subdiffusive ($z>2$) values of $z$ in\nthe entire range. Thus we demonstrate that the worms represent a discrete-time\nrealization of a fractional Brownian motion characterized by these properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 16:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 17:54:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

The pulse electron-nuclear double\nresonance was applied to resolve the hyperfine interaction of the trapped\nelectron with surrounding nuclei. The measurements show that at low\ntemperatures, T < 50 K, EPR spectrum of the F+ center is anisotropic with g\nfactors in the range 1.999-1.988 and originates from three magnetically\ninequivalent positions of the center in garnet lattice according to different\ndirections of the Al(IV)-VO-Al(VI) chains, where Al(IV) and Al(VI) are the\ntetrahedral and octahedral Al sites, respectively. As the temperature\nincreases, the EPR spectrum becomes isotropic suggesting a motional averaging\nof the anisotropy due to motion of electron between neighboring oxygen\nvacancies. With further increase of the temperature to T > 200 K, we observed\ndelocalization of the electron into the conduction band with the activation\nenergy about 0.4-0.5 eV that resulted in substantial narrowing of the EPR\nspectral line with simultaneous change of its shape from the Gaussian to\nLorentzian due to diminish up to zero of the Fermi contact hyperfine field at\n27Al and 89Y nuclei.

Coverage-guided fuzzers trace every testcase's\ncode coverage through either static or dynamic binary instrumentation, or more\nrecently, using hardware support. Unfortunately, tracing all testcases incurs\nsignificant performance penalties---even when the overwhelming majority of\ntestcases and their coverage information are discarded because they do not\nincrease code coverage. To eliminate needless tracing by coverage-guided\nfuzzers, we introduce the notion of coverage-guided tracing. Coverage-guided\ntracing leverages two observations: (1) only a fraction of generated testcases\nincrease coverage, and thus require tracing; and (2) coverage-increasing\ntestcases become less frequent over time. Coverage-guided tracing works by\nencoding the current frontier of code coverage in the target binary so that it\nself-reports when a testcase produces new coverage---without tracing. This acts\nas a filter for tracing; restricting the expense of tracing to only\ncoverage-increasing testcases. Thus, coverage-guided tracing chooses to\ntradeoff increased coverage-increasing-testcase handling time for the ability\nto execute testcases initially at native speed. To show the potential of\ncoverage-guided tracing, we create an implementation based on the static binary\ninstrumentor Dyninst called UnTracer. We evaluate UnTracer using eight\nreal-world binaries commonly used by the fuzzing community. Experiments show\nthat after only an hour of fuzzing, UnTracer's average overhead is below 1%,\nand after 24-hours of fuzzing, UnTracer approaches 0% overhead, while tracing\nevery testcase with popular white- and black-box-binary tracers AFL-Clang,\nAFL-QEMU, and AFL-Dyninst incurs overheads of 36%, 612%, and 518%,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 16:19:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 21:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-30"}

For biological\nreaction networks governed by the chemical Master equation, we derive\nmodel-based information approximations and analytical upper bounds, against\nwhich we benchmark our proposed model-free decoding estimators. In contrast to\nthe frequently-used k-nearest-neighbor estimator, decoding-based estimators\nrobustly extract a large fraction of the available information from\nhigh-dimensional trajectories with a realistic number of data samples. We apply\nthese estimators to previously published data on Erk and Ca signaling in\nmammalian cells and to yeast stress-response, and find that substantial amount\nof information about environmental state can be encoded by non-trivial response\nstatistics even in stationary signals. We argue that these single-cell,\ndecoding-based information estimates, rather than the commonly-used tests for\nsignificant differences between selected population response statistics,\nprovide a proper and unbiased measure for the performance of biological\nsignaling networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 16:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

This\nraises the following important questions: 1) why most opinion polls were not\naccurate in 2016? and 2) how to improve the accuracies of opinion polls? In\nthis paper, we study the inaccuracies of opinion polls in the 2016 election\nthrough the lens of information theory. We first propose a general framework of\nparameter estimation, called clean sensing (polling), which performs optimal\nparameter estimation with sensing cost constraints, from heterogeneous and\npotentially distorted data sources. We then cast the opinion polling as a\nproblem of parameter estimation from potentially distorted heterogeneous data\nsources, and derive the optimal polling strategy using heterogenous and\npossibly distorted data under cost constraints. Our results show that a larger\nnumber of data samples do not necessarily lead to better polling accuracy,\nwhich give a possible explanation of the inaccuracies of opinion polls in 2016.\nThe optimal sensing strategy should instead optimally allocate sensing\nresources over heterogenous data sources according to several factors including\ndata quality, and, moreover, for a particular data source, it should strike an\noptimal balance between the quality of data samples, and the quantity of data\nsamples.\n  As a byproduct of this research, in a general setting, we derive a group of\nnew lower bounds on the mean-squared errors of general unbiased and biased\nparameter estimators. These new lower bounds can be tighter than the classical\nCram\\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) and Chapman-Robbins bound. Our derivations are via\nstudying the Lagrange dual problems of certain convex programs. The classical\nCram\\'{e}r-Rao bound and Chapman-Robbins bound follow naturally from our\nresults for special cases of these convex programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 16:41:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

The two most popular communication paradigms used for spreading\nthe rumor are Push and Pull algorithms. The former protocol allows nodes to\nsend the rumor to a randomly selected neighbor at each step, while the latter\nis based on sending a request and downloading the rumor from a randomly\nselected neighbor, provided the neighbor has it. Previous analysis of these\nprotocols assumed that every node could process all such push/pull operations\nwithin a single step, which could be unrealistic in practical situations.\nTherefore we propose a new framework for analysis rumor spreading accommodating\nbuffers, in which a node can process only one push/pull message or push request\nat a time.

Two issues exist in the system: first, the current output of the\nCTC model relies on the current input and does not account for context weighted\ninputs. This is the hard alignment issue. Second, the word-based CTC model\nsuffers from the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue. This means it can model only\nfrequently occurring words while tagging the remaining words as OOV. Hence,\nsuch a model is limited in its capacity in recognizing only a fixed set of\nfrequent words. In this study, we propose addressing these problems using a\ncombination of attention mechanism and mixed-units. In particular, we introduce\nAttention CTC, Self-Attention CTC, Hybrid CTC, and Mixed-unit CTC.\n  First, we blend attention modeling capabilities directly into the CTC network\nusing Attention CTC and Self-Attention CTC. Second, to alleviate the OOV issue,\nwe present Hybrid CTC which uses a word and letter CTC with shared hidden\nlayers. The Hybrid CTC consults the letter CTC when the word CTC emits an OOV.\nThen, we propose a much better solution by training a Mixed-unit CTC which\ndecomposes all the OOV words into sequences of frequent words and multi-letter\nunits. Evaluated on a 3400 hours Microsoft Cortana voice assistant task, our\nfinal acoustic-to-word solution using attention and mixed-units achieves a\nrelative reduction in word error rate (WER) over the vanilla word CTC by\n12.09\\%.

We find ~13%\nscatter in DM to a source at z=1 and ~7% at z=3 (one sigma). The distribution\nof DM is close to Gaussian. We simulate samples of FRBs and examine their\napplicability to simple cosmological tests. Our calculations show that using a\nsample of 100 FRBs and fixing cosmological model one can find the redshift and\nsample averaged fraction of ionized gas with ~1% uncertainty. Finding the\nionized fraction with ~1% accuracy at few different epochs would require ~10\n000 FRBs with known redshifts. Because DM is proportional to the product of\nionized fraction, baryon density and the Hubble constant it is impossible to\nconstrain these parameters separately with FRBs. Constraints on cosmological\ndensities are possible in a flat LCDM model but give uninterestingly low\naccuracy. Using FRBs with other type of data improves the constraints, but the\nrole of FRBs is not crucial. Thus constraints on the distribution of ionized\ngas are probably the most promising application of FRBs which allow for\n\"tomography\" if sources redshifts are known, as opposed to measuring electron\nscattering optical depth or S-Z y parameters with CMB observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 18:18:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

In this work, we\ntheoretically propose that the study of magnetostriction provides a powerful\nand novel tool to directly detect higher-order multipolar symmetry breaking $-$\nsuch as the elusive octupolar order $-$ by examining its scaling behaviour with\nrespect to an applied magnetic field $h$. As an illustrative example, we\nexamine such key scaling signatures in the context of Pr-based cage compounds\nwith strongly correlated $f$-electrons, Pr(Ti,V,Ir)$_2$(Al,Zn)$_{20}$, whose\nlow energy degrees of freedom are composed of purely higher-order multipoles:\nquadrupoles $\\mathcal{O}_{20,22}$ and octupole $\\mathcal{T}_{xyz}$. Employing a\nsymmetry-based Landau theory of multipolar moments coupled to lattice strain\nfields, we demonstrate that a magnetic field applied along the [111] direction\nresults in a length change with a distinct linear-in-$h$ scaling behaviour,\naccompanied by hysteresis, below the octupolar ordering temperature. We show\nthat the resulting \"magnetostriction coefficient\" is directly proportional to\nthe octupolar order parameter, providing the first clear access to this subtle\norder parameter. Along other field directions, we show that the field\ndependence of the magnetostriction provides a window into quadrupolar orders.\nOur work provides a springboard for future experimental and theoretical\ninvestigations of multipolar orders and their quantum phase transitions in a\nwide variety of systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

Readout\nfidelity can be enhanced by repeating readouts. However, the number of repeated\nreadouts is limited by measurement backaction, which changes the quantum state\nthat is measured. This detrimental effect can be overcome by storing the\nquantum state in an ancilla qubit, chosen to be robust against measurement\nbackaction and to allow error correction. Here, we protect the electronic-spin\nstate of a diamond nitrogen-vacancy center from measurement backaction using a\nrobust multilevel 14N nuclear spin memory and perform repetitive readout, as\ndemonstrated in previous work on bulk diamond devices. We achieve additional\nprotection using error correction based on the quantum logic of coherent\nfeedback to reverse measurement backaction. The repetitive spin readout scheme\nprovides a 13-fold enhancement of readout fidelity over conventional readout\nand the error correction a 2-fold improvement in the signal. These experiments\ndemonstrate full quantum control of a nitrogen vacancy center electronic spin\ncoupled to its host 14N nuclear spin inside a ~25 nm nanodiamond, creating a\nsensitive and biologically compatible platform for nanoscale quantum sensing.\nOur error-corrected repetitive readout scheme is particularly useful for\nquadrupolar nuclear magnetic resonance imaging in the low magnetic field regime\nwhere conventional repetitive readout suffers from strong measurement\nbackaction. More broadly, methods for correcting longitudinal (bit-flip) errors\ndescribed here could be used to improve quantum algorithms that require\nnonvolatile local memory, such as correlation spectroscopy measurements for\nhigh resolution sensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 19:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-03"}

This happens\nwhen the potential energy of the system dominates over its kinetic energy,\ni.e., at low temperatures for a classical system and at low densities for a\nquantum one. At $T=0$, the system is governed by quantum mechanics, and hence,\nthe spatial density peaks associated with crystalline charge localization are\nsharpened for a lower average density. Conversely, in the classical limit of\nhigh temperatures, the crystalline spatial density peaks are suppressed\n(recovered) at a lower (higher) average density. In this paper, we study those\ntwo limits separately using an exact diagonalization of small one-dimensional\n(1D) systems containing few ($<10$) electrons and propose an approximate method\nto connect them into a unified effective phase diagram for Wigner few-electron\ncrystallization. The result is a qualitative quantum-classical crossover phase\ndiagram of an effective 1D Wigner crystal. We show that the spatial density\npeaks associated with the quasi-crystallization should be experimentally\nobservable in a few-electron 1D system. We find that the effective crystalline\nstructure slowly disappears with both the crossover average density and\ncrossover temperature for crystallization decreasing with increasing particle\nnumber, consistent with the absence of any true long-range 1D order. In fact,\none peculiar aspect of the effective finite-size nature of 1D Wigner\ncrystallization we find is that even a short-range interaction would lead to a\nfinite-size 1D crystal, except that the crystalline order vanishes much faster\nwith increasing system size in the short-range interacting system compared with\nthe long-range interacting one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 19:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 16:04:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 18:12:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

We also discuss the\nimplications of certain missing states proposed from other phenomenological\napproaches, and suggest that the physics of fractional quantum Hall physics\ncould fundamentally arise from the algebra of the Hilbert space in a single\nLandau level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 21:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jan 2019 12:56:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 09:07:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 15:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

Aside from their combinatorial significance,\nspanning 2-forests have an important application to the calculation of\nresistance distance or effective resistance. The resistance distance between\nvertices $u$ and $v$ in a graph representing an electrical circuit with unit\nresistance on each edge is the number of spanning 2-forests separating $u$ and\n$v$ divided by the number of spanning trees in the graph. There are also\nwell-known matrix theoretic methods for calculating resistance distance, but\nthe way in which the structure of the underlying graph determines resistance\ndistance via these methods is not well understood.\n  For any connected graph $G$ with a 2-separator separating vertices $u$ and\n$v$, we show that the number of spanning trees and spanning 2-forests\nseparating $u$ and $v$ can be expressed in terms of these same quantities for\nthe smaller separated graphs, which makes computation significantly more\ntractable. An important special case is the preservation of the number of\nspanning 2-forests if $u$ and $v$ are in the same smaller graph. In this paper\nwe demonstrate that this method of calculating resistance distance is more\nsuitable for certain structured families of graphs than the more standard\nmethods.

We introduce a novel deep neural network that extends the scope to\nextreme relative poses, with little or even no overlap between the input scans.\nThe key idea is to infer more complete scene information about the underlying\nenvironment and match on the completed scans. In particular, instead of only\nperforming scene completion from each individual scan, our approach alternates\nbetween relative pose estimation and scene completion. This allows us to\nperform scene completion by utilizing information from both input scans at late\niterations, resulting in better results for both scene completion and relative\npose estimation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our\napproach leads to considerable improvements over state-of-the-art approaches\nfor relative pose estimation. In particular, our approach provides encouraging\nrelative pose estimates even between non-overlapping scans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 23:43:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2019 22:33:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

Optical\nenhancement of the optical pump and the sideband is achieved using resonant\nsupermodes of two coupled optical resonators, and the RF enhancement is\nachieved with LC circuits formed by the capacitances of the optical resonators\nand inductors which can be implemented using CMOS technology. In the proposed\nconfiguration, the photon lifetime determines the bandwidth of the RF response\nbut not its center frequency, which is set by the coupling strength between the\ntwo resonators and is not subject to the photon lifetime constraint inherent to\nconventional single-mode resonant modulators. This enables efficient operation\nat high RF carrier frequencies without a reduction in efficiency commonly\nassociated with the photon lifetime limit. Two optical configurations of the\nmodulator are proposed: a \"basic\" configuration with equal Q-factors in both\nsupermodes, most suitable for narrowband RF signals, and a \"generalized\"\nconfiguration with independently tailored Q-factors of the two supermodes,\nwhich makes it possible to broaden the RF bandwidth without sacrificing the\nresonant enhancement of the optical pump and paying a penalty in modulation\nefficiency associated with doing so. Additionally, a significant gain in\nmodulation efficiency is expected from RF signal enhancement by LC resonant\nmatching. This results in a modulator which is compact, efficient, and capable\nof modulation at high RF carrier frequencies. The proposed modulator\narchitecture optimally engineers the interaction of the device with each of the\nthree signals and between them, can be applied to any modulator cavity design\nor modulation mechanism and promises to enable complex RF-photonic systems on\nchip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jan 2019 01:13:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

Compressive sensing with matrix uncertainty is an\nextension of the standard compressive sensing problem that appears in various\napplications including but not limited to cognitive radio sensing, calibration\nof the antenna, and deconvolution. The original problem of compressive sensing\nis NP-hard so the traditional techniques, such as convex and nonconvex\nrelaxations and greedy algorithms, apply stringent constraints on the\nmeasurement matrix to indirectly handle this problem in the realm of classical\ncomputing. We propose well-posed approaches for both binary compressive sensing\nand binary compressive sensing with matrix uncertainty problems that are\ntractable by quantum annealers. Our approach formulates an Ising model whose\nground state represents a sparse solution for the binary compressive sensing\nproblem and then employs an alternating minimization scheme to tackle the\nbinary compressive sensing with matrix uncertainty problem. This setting only\nrequires the solution uniqueness of the considered problem to have a successful\nrecovery process, and therefore the required conditions on the measurement\nmatrix are notably looser. As a proof of concept, we can demonstrate the\napplicability of the proposed approach on the D-Wave quantum annealers;\nhowever, we can adapt our method to employ other modern computing phenomena\n-like adiabatic quantum computers (in general), CMOS annealers, optical\nparametric oscillators, and neuromorphic computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jan 2019 04:17:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-03"}

Different from them, we propose an\nuncertainty of query completeness, called Probability of query Completeness (PC\nfor short). PC refers to the possibility that query results contain all\nsatisfied records. For example PC=0.95, it guarantees that there are no more\nthan 5 incomplete queries among 100 ones, but not guarantees how incomplete\nthey are. We trade off PC for query performance, and experiments show that a\nsmall loss of PC doubles query performance. The proposed Probery\n(PROBability-based data quERY) adopts the uncertainty of query completeness to\naccelerate OLTP queries. This paper illustrates the data and probability\nmodels, the probability based data placement and query processing, and the\nApache Drill-based implementation of Probery. In experiments, we first prove\nthat the percentage of complete queries is larger than the given PC confidence\nfor various cases, namely that the PC guarantee is validate. Then Probery is\ncompared with Drill, Impala and Hive in terms of query performance. The results\nindicate that Drill-based Probery performs as fast as Drill with complete\nquery, while averagely 1.8x, 1.3x and 1.6x faster than Drill, Impala and Hive\nwith possible complete query, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jan 2019 08:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-03"}

By\nassuming noise to come from a Gaussian, Laplace or mixture of Gaussian\ndistributions, significant efforts have been made on optimizing the (weighted)\n$L_1$ or $L_2$-norm loss between an observed matrix and its bilinear\nfactorization. However, the type of noise distribution is generally unknown in\nreal applications and inappropriate assumptions will inevitably deteriorate the\nbehavior of LRMF. On the other hand, real data are often corrupted by skew\nrather than symmetric noise. To tackle this problem, this paper presents a\nnovel LRMF model called AQ-LRMF by modeling noise with a mixture of asymmetric\nLaplace distributions. An efficient algorithm based on the\nexpectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is also offered to estimate the\nparameters involved in AQ-LRMF. The AQ-LRMF model possesses the advantage that\nit can approximate noise well no matter whether the real noise is symmetric or\nskew.

The experiments conducted on synthetic and\nreal datasets show that AQ-LRMF outperforms several state-of-the-art\ntechniques. Furthermore, AQ-LRMF also has the superiority over the other\nalgorithms in terms of capturing local structural information contained in real\nimages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jan 2019 12:04:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 May 2019 13:50:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 14:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

The\nside-information hypergraph becomes a side-information graph for a special\nclass of groupcast index coding problems known as unicast index coding\nproblems. The computation of minrank is an NP-hard problem. There exists a low\nrank matrix completion method and clique cover method to find suboptimal\nsolutions to the index coding problem represented by a side-information graph.\nHowever, both the methods are NP-hard. The number of computations required to\nfind the minrank depends on the number of edges present in the side-information\ngraph. In this paper, we define the notion of minrank-critical edges in a\nside-information graph and derive some properties of minrank, which identifies\nminrank-non-critical edges. Using these properties we present a method for\nreduction of the given minrank computation problem into a smaller problem.\nAlso, we give an heuristic algorithm to find a clique cover of the\nside-information graph by using some binary operations on the adjacency matrix\nof the side-information graph.

Yet,\nthe devices used in modern data centers fail due to a variety of causes, from\nfaulty components to bugs to misconfiguration. Faulty devices make operating\nlarge scale data centers challenging because the workloads running in modern\ndata centers consist of interdependent programs distributed across many\nservers, so failures that are isolated to a single device can still have a\nwidespread effect on a workload. In this dissertation, we measure and model the\ndevice failures in a large scale Internet service company, Facebook. We focus\non three device types that form the foundation of Internet service data center\ninfrastructure: DRAM for main memory, SSDs for persistent storage, and switches\nand backbone links for network connectivity. For each of these device types, we\nanalyze long term device failure data broken down by important device\nattributes and operating conditions, such as age, vendor, and workload. We also\nbuild and release statistical models to examine the failure trends for the\ndevices we analyze. Our key conclusion in this dissertation is that we can gain\na deep understanding of why devices fail---and how to predict their\nfailure---using measurement and modeling. We hope that the analysis,\ntechniques, and models we present in this dissertation will enable the\ncommunity to better measure, understand, and prepare for the hardware\nreliability challenges we face in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jan 2019 01:43:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-14"}

Numerical, Discrete Element\nMethod (DEM) simulations on two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) assemblies\nshow that particle rotations are diverse, that they increase with strain until\nthe material begins to soften, and that they are expressed in spatial patterns,\neven at small strains. The interactions of a pair of particles are a\ncombination of three modes: a contact deformation mode, a contact rolling mode,\nand a mode of rigid pair motions. Definitions are presented for each mode,\nincluding four different definitions of contact rolling. A rolling curl is also\ndefined, which describes the cumulative rolling of neighboring particles around\na central particle or sub-region. At a larger scale, material deformation and\nrotation are measured within small sub-regions of material, and the material\ndeformation can be attributed to separate contributions of contact rolling,\ncontact deformation, and the rigid-rotation of particle pairs. The diversity\nand extend of contact rolling were measured in 2D and 3D simulations. A\ndominant rolling pattern was observed, which resembles the interactions of\nrolling gears. This pattern can extend to distances of at least six particle\ndiameters from a central particle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jan 2019 01:24:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-23"}
