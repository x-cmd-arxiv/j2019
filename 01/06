For PCPs, Matern cluster and Thomas cluster processes,\nare analyzed. Furthermore, both 3D blockage processes and 3D antenna patterns\nare introduced for appraising the effect of altitudes. Based on this unified\nframework, several closed-form expressions for the coverage probability in the\nuplink and downlink, are derived. By investigating the entire communication\nprocess, which includes the two aforementioned phases and the cooperative\ntransmission between them, tractable expressions of system coverage\nprobabilities are derived. Next, three practical applications in UAV networks\nare provided as case studies of the proposed framework. The results reveal that\nthe impact of thermal noise and non-line-of-sight mmWave transmissions is\nnegligible. In the considered networks, mmWave outperforms sub-6 GHz in terms\nof the data rate, due to the sharp direction beamforming and large transmit\nbandwidth.

Unlike in the measure-theoretic case, where\nKolmogorov--Sinai entropy is the estimate, in the topological setup the task\nreaches beyond the classical theory of entropy. Tools from an extended theory\nof entropy structures are needed. The main goal of this paper is to prove the\nSEET for actions of countable amenable groups: Let a countable amenable group\n$G$ act by homeomorphisms on a compact metric space $X$ and let $\\mathcal\nM_G(X)$ denote the simplex of $G$-invariant probability measures on $X$.

The extreme\nbandwidth and robustness of the photonic topological metamaterial are\nbeneficial for practical applications such as one-way waveguide and photonic\nintegrated systems but also advantageous in design and fabrication since the\nonly necessary condition is to satisfy the effective hyperbolic and chiral\nproperties, without entailing strict periodic arrangement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2019 01:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

However, they generally do not admit closed-form solutions and are\nnotoriously difficult to solve. Also, in reality, each agent often does not\nhave complete knowledge of the other agent. This paper studies a\nleader-follower partially observable stochastic game where the leader has\nlittle knowledge of the adversarial follower's reward structure, level of\nrationality, and process for gathering and transmitting data relevant for\ndecision making. We introduce the worst-case analysis to the partially\nobservable stochastic game to cope with this lack of knowledge and determine\nthe best worst-case value function of the leader. The resulting problem from\nthe leader's perspective has a simple sufficient statistic; however, different\nfrom a classical partially observable Markov decision process, the value\nfunction of the resulting problem may not be convex. We design a viable and\ncomputationally attractive solution procedure for computing a lower bound of\nthe leader's value function as well as its associated control policy in the\nfinite planning horizon. We illustrate the use of the proposed approach in a\nliquid egg production security problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2019 01:39:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 01:52:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

Database systems for\nmodern computing architectures rely on extensive in-memory processing supported\nby massive multithread parallelism and vectorized instructions.

Convolutional neural network (CNN) models are\nwidely adopted with proven successes in acoustic scene classification. However,\nthere is little insight on how an audio scene is perceived in CNN, as what have\nbeen demonstrated in image recognition research. In the present study, the\nClass Activation Mapping (CAM) is utilized to analyze how the log-magnitude\nMel-scale filter-bank (log-Mel) features of different acoustic scenes are\nlearned in a CNN classifier. It is noted that distinct high-energy\ntime-frequency components of audio signals generally do not correspond to\nstrong activation on CAM, while the background sound texture are well learned\nin CNN. In order to make the sound texture more salient, we propose to apply\nthe Difference of Gaussian (DoG) and Sobel operator to process the log-Mel\nfeatures and enhance edge information of the time-frequency image. Experimental\nresults on the DCASE 2017 ASC challenge show that using edge enhanced log-Mel\nimages as input feature of CNN significantly improves the performance of audio\nscene classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2019 05:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

The separation of paired Weyl points allows charge transfer between\nthem in the presence of parallel electric and magnetic fields, which is known\nas the chiral anomaly. In this paper, we theoretically study the influence of\nthe chiral anomaly induced chiral charge imbalance on the Josephson current in\na Weyl superconductor-Weyl semimetal-Weyl superconductor junction. In Weyl\nsuperconductors, two types of pairings are considered, namely, zero momentum\nBCS-like pairing and finite momentum FFLO-like pairing. For BCS-like pairing,\nwe find that the Josephson current exhibits $0$-$\\pi$ transitions and\noscillates as a function of $\\lambda_{0} L $, where $\\lambda_{0}$ is the\nchirality imbalance induced by the parallel electric and magnetic fields and\n$L$ is the length of the Weyl semimetal. The amplitude of the Josephson current\nalso depends on the angle $\\beta$ between the line connecting two paired Weyl\npoints and the transport direction along the junction. For FFLO-like pairing,\nthe chirality imbalance induced periodic oscillations are absent and the\nJosephson current is also independent of the angle $\\beta$. These findings are\nuseful in detecting the chiral anomaly and distinguishing the superconducting\npairing mechanism of Weyl semimetals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2019 09:31:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

Dynamic service provisioning requires the use\nof on-line algorithms that automatically compute the path to be taken to\nsatisfy the given service request. A typical transport network element supports\nadaptation of multiple technologies and multiple layers of those technologies\nto carry the input traffic. Further, transport networks are deployed such that\nthey follow different topologies like linear, ring, mesh, protected linear,\ndual homing etc. in different layers. Path computation for service requests\nconsidering the above factors is the focus of this work, where a new mechanism\nfor building an auxiliary graph which models each layer as a node within each\nnetwork element and creates adaptation edges between them and also supports\ncreation of special edges to represent different types of topologies is\nproposed. Logical links that represent multiplexing or adaptation are also\ncreated in the auxiliary graph.

In the case the Witten index is zero it is in\ngeneral hard to distinguish between theories with or without dynamical\nsupersymmetry breaking. In this work we show that for a large class of theories\nthe cancellation of the Witten index by itself signals the formation of a quark\ncondensate and therefore produces dynamical supersymmetry breaking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2019 13:30:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 11:09:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 2019 05:11:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

The luminosity\ndistance is obtained from the gravitational wave signal detected by the\nLIGO/Virgo Collaboration (LVC) on 2017 August 14, and the redshift information\nis provided by the DES Year 3 data. Black-hole mergers such as GW170814 are\nexpected to lack bright electromagnetic emission to uniquely identify their\nhost galaxies and build an object-by-object Hubble diagram. However, they are\nsuitable for a statistical measurement, provided that a galaxy catalog of\nadequate depth and redshift completion is available. Here we present the first\nHubble parameter measurement using a black-hole merger. Our analysis results in\n$H_0 = 75.2^{+39.5}_{-32.4}~{\\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, which is consistent with\nboth SN Ia and CMB measurements of the Hubble constant. The quoted 68% credible\nregion comprises 60% of the uniform prior range [20,140] ${\\rm\nkm~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, and it depends on the assumed prior range. If we take a\nbroader prior of [10,220] ${\\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, we find $H_0 = 78^{+\n96}_{-24}~{\\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ ($57\\%$ of the prior range). Although a\nweak constraint on the Hubble constant from a single event is expected using\nthe dark siren method, a multifold increase in the LVC event rate is\nanticipated in the coming years and combinations of many sirens will lead to\nimproved constraints on $H_0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2019 13:32:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 2019 22:25:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

Test suite generation has peculiarities\nthat are quite different from other more regular optimisation problems. For\nexample, given an existing test suite, one can add more tests to cover the\nremaining objectives. One would like the smallest number of small tests to\ncover as many objectives as possible, but that is a secondary goal compared to\ncovering those targets in the first place. Furthermore, the amount of\nobjectives in software testing can quickly become unmanageable, in the order of\n(tens/hundreds of) thousands, especially for system testing of industrial size\nsystems. Traditional multi-objective optimisation algorithms can already start\nto struggle with just four or five objectives to optimize. To overcome these\nissues, different techniques have been proposed, like for example the Whole\nTest Suite (WTS) approach and the Many-Objective Sorting Algorithm (MOSA).\nHowever, those techniques might not scale well to very large numbers of\nobjectives and limited search budgets (a typical case in system testing). In\nthis paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called Many Independent Objective\n(MIO) algorithm. This algorithm is designed and tailored based on the specific\nproperties of test suite generation. An empirical study, on a set of artificial\nand actual software, shows that the MIO algorithm can achieve higher coverage\ncompared to WTS and MOSA, as it can better exploit the peculiarities of test\nsuite generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jan 2019 13:35:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

Our approach is twofold. First, we explore spatial\ncorrelations in both saliency map and eye-fixation map. Then, we learn\nspatiotemporal correlations that define a reliable saliency map. We first study\nspatiotemporal eye-fixation data from a public dataset and investigate a common\nfeature in human visual attention, which dictates correlation in saliency\nbetween a pixel and its direct neighbors. Based on the study, we then develop\nan algorithm that estimates a pixel-wise uncertainty map that reflects our\nconfidence in the associated computational saliency map by relating a pixel's\nsaliency to the saliency of its neighbors. To estimate such uncertainties, we\nmeasure the divergence of a pixel, in a saliency map, from its local\nneighborhood. Additionally, we propose a systematic procedure to evaluate the\nestimation performance by explicitly computing uncertainty ground truth as a\nfunction of a given saliency map and eye fixations of human subjects.

Its power and potential of\nresolving more and more challenging physical problems have been and are being\ndemonstrated in science and engineering covering a wide range of disciplines\nsuch as physics, chemistry, biology, material science and image analysis. The\nmethod is a highly simplified model for fluid flows using a few limited\nfictitious particles that move one grid at a constant time interval and collide\neach other at a grid point on uniform lattices, which are the two routine steps\nfor implementation of the method to simulate fluid flows. As such, a real\ncomplex particle dynamics is approximated as a regular particle model using\nthree parameters of lattice size, particle speed and collision operator. A\nfundamental question is \"Are the two steps integral to the method or can the\nthree parameters be reduced to one for a minimal lattice Boltzmann method?\".\nHere, I show that the collision step can be removed and the standard LBM can be\nreformulated into a simple macroscopic lattice Boltzmann method (MacLAB). This\nmodel relies on macroscopic physical variables only and is completely defined\nby one basic parameter of lattice size dx, bringing the LBM into a precise\n\"Lattice\" Boltzmann method. The viscous effect on flows is naturally embedded\nthrough the particle speed, making it an ideal automatic simulator for fluid\nflows. The findings have been demonstrated and confirmed with numerical tests\nincluding flows that are independent of and dependent on fluid viscosity, 2D\nand 3D cavity flows, and an unsteady Taylor-Green vortex flow. This provides an\nefficient and powerful model for resolving physical problems in various\ndisciplines of science and engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2019 17:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-10"}

To solve both problems, first a\npowerful representation is proposed that unifies most of the neural networks\nfeatures from the literature into one representation. Secondly, a new diversity\npreserving method called Spectrum Diversity is created based on the new concept\nof chromosome spectrum that creates a spectrum out of the characteristics and\nfrequency of alleles in a chromosome.
