PopNetCod is a distributed\ncaching policy, in which each router measures the local popularity of the\ncontent objects by analyzing the requests that it receives. It then uses this\ninformation to decide which Data packets to cache or evict from its content\nstore. Since network coding is used, partial caching of content objects is\nsupported, which facilitates the management of the content store. The routers\ndecide the Data packets that they cache or evict in an online manner when they\nreceive requests for Data packets. This allows the most popular Data packets to\nbe cached closer to the network edges. The evaluation of PopNetCod shows an\nimproved cache-hit rate compared to the widely used Leave Copy Everywhere\nplacement policy and the Least Recently Used eviction policy. The improved\ncache-hit rate helps the clients to achieve higher goodput, while it also\nreduces the load on the source servers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2019 16:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-07"}

We find that\nthe feedback from the AGN efficiently controls the growth of the black hole and\nlimits the duration of the high accretion episodes by emptying the gas\nreservoir.

The minimization is subject to an affine constraint, that\nallows in particular to deal with composite problems (sum of more than three\nfunctions) in a separate way by the usual product space technique. While\nclassical conditional gradient methods require Lipschitz-continuity of the\ngradient of the differentiable part of the objective, CGALP needs only\ndifferentiability (on an appropriate subset), hence circumventing the intricate\nquestion of Lipschitz continuity of gradients. For the two remaining functions\nin the objective, we do not require any additional regularity assumption. The\nsecond function, possibly nonsmooth, is assumed simple, i.e., the associated\nproximal mapping is easily computable. For the third function, again nonsmooth,\nwe just assume that its domain is also bounded and that a linearly perturbed\nminimization oracle is accessible. In particular, this last function can be\nchosen to be the indicator of a nonempty bounded closed convex set, in order to\ndeal with additional constraints. Finally, the affine constraint is addressed\nby the augmented Lagrangian approach. Our analysis is carried out for a wide\nchoice of algorithm parameters satisfying so called \"open loop\" rules. As main\nresults, under mild conditions, we show asymptotic feasibility with respect to\nthe affine constraint, boundedness of the dual multipliers, and convergence of\nthe Lagrangian values to the saddle-point optimal value.

The fundamental difference between polymorphous $<P(S_i)>$\nand monomorphous $P(S_0)$ led to the often-diverging results and the missing\nthe atomic-scale resolution needed to discern symmetry-related physics. A\nnatural approach capturing the polymorphous aspect is supercell model, which\nhowever suffers the difficulty of band folding ('spaghetti bands'), rendering\nthe E vs k dispersion needed in topology and Rashba physics and seen in\nexperiments, practically inaccessible. A solution that retains the polymorphous\nnature but restores the E vs k relation is to unfold the supercell bands.

One major criticism of the 3+3 design is that it is based\non simple rules, does not depend on statistical models for inference, and leads\nto unsafe and unreliable operating characteristics. On the other hand, being\nrule-based allows 3+3 to be easily understood and implemented in practice,\nmaking it the first choice among clinicians. Is it possible to have a\nrule-based design with great performance? Methods: We propose a new rule-based\ndesign called i3+3, where the letter \"i\" represents the word \"interval\". The\ni3+3 design is based on simple but more advanced rules that account for the\nvariabilities in the observed data. We compare the operating characteristics\nfor the proposed i3+3 design with other popular phase I designs by simulation.\nResults: The i3+3 design is far superior than the 3+3 design in trial safety\nand the ability to identify the true MTD. Compared with model-based phase I\ndesigns, i3+3 also demonstrates comparable performances. In other words, the\ni3+3 design possesses both the simplicity and transparency of the rule-based\napproaches, and the superior operating characteristics seen in model-based\napproaches. An online R Shiny tool (https://i3design.shinyapps.io/i3plus3/) is\nprovided to illustrate the i3+3 design, although in practice it requires no\nsoftware to design or conduct a dose-finding trial. Conclusion: The i3+3 design\ncould be a practice-altering method for the clinical community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2019 20:34:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2019 02:37:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

In\nthis paper we present a method to tune the interlayer coupling in Bi2Se3/MoS2\n2D heterostructures by regulating the oxygen presence in the atmosphere, while\napplying laser or thermal energy. Our data suggests the interlayer coupling is\ntuned through the diffusive intercalation and de-intercalation of oxygen\nmolecules. When one layer of Bi2Se3 is grown on monolayer MoS2, an influential\ninterlayer coupling is formed that quenches the signature photoluminescence\n(PL) peaks. However, thermally annealing in the presence of oxygen disrupts the\ninterlayer coupling, facilitating the emergence of the MoS2 PL peak. DFT\ncalculations predict intercalated oxygen increases the interlayer separation\n~17%, disrupting the interlayer coupling and inducing the layers to behave more\nelectronically independent. The interlayer coupling can then be restored by\nthermally annealing in N2 or Ar, where the peaks will re-quench. Hence, this is\nan interesting oxygen-induced switching between \"non-radiative\" and \"radiative\"\nexciton recombination. This switching can also be accomplished locally,\ncontrollably, and reversibly using a low-power focused laser, while changing\nthe environment from pure N2 to air. This allows for the interlayer coupling to\nbe precisely manipulated with submicron spatial resolution, facilitating\nsite-programmable 2D light-emitting pixels whose emission intensity could be\nprecisely varied by a factor exceeding 200x.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular approach\nfor arriving at optimal strategies by predicating stimuli, such as the reward\nfor following a strategy, on experience. RL is heavily explored in the\nsingle-agent context, but is a nascent concept in multiagent problems. To this\nend, I propose several principled model-free and partially model-based\nreinforcement learning approaches for several multiagent settings. In the realm\nof normative reinforcement learning, I introduce scalable extensions to Monte\nCarlo exploring starts for partially observable Markov Decision Processes\n(POMDP), dubbed MCES-P, where I expand the theory and algorithm to the\nmultiagent setting. I first examine MCES-P with probably approximately correct\n(PAC) bounds in the context of multiagent setting, showing MCESP+PAC holds in\nthe presence of other agents. I then propose a more sample-efficient\nmethodology for antagonistic settings, MCESIP+PAC. For cooperative settings, I\nextend MCES-P to the Multiagent POMDP, dubbed MCESMP+PAC. I then explore the\nuse of reinforcement learning as a methodology in searching for optima in\nrealistic and latent model environments. First, I explore a parameterized\nQ-learning approach in modeling humans learning to reason in an uncertain,\nmultiagent environment. Next, I propose an implementation of MCES-P, along with\nimage segmentation, to create an adaptive team-based reinforcement learning\ntechnique to positively identify the presence of phenotypically-expressed water\nand pathogen stress in crop fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2019 21:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

Here, we present a theoretical model\nfor the electrochemical kinetics of SEI growth coupled to lithium\nintercalation, which accurately predicts experimental results with few\nadjustable parameters. The key hypothesis is that the initial SEI is a mixed\nion-electron conductor, and its electronic conductivity varies approximately\nwith the square of the local lithium concentration, consistent with hopping\nconduction of electrons along percolating networks. By including a lithium-ion\nconcentration dependence for the electronic conductivity in the SEI, the bulk\nSEI thus modulates the overpotential and exchange current of the electrolyte\nreduction reaction. As a result, SEI growth is promoted during lithiation but\nsuppressed during delithiation. This new insight establishes the fundamental\nelectrochemistry of SEI growth kinetics. Our model improves upon existing\nmodels by introducing the effects of electrochemical SEI growth and its\ndependence on potential, current magnitude, and current direction in predicting\ncapacity fade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2019 21:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

However, achieving this\npromise is challenging because (1) HBM is capacity-limited and (2) HBM boosts\nperformance best for sequential access and high parallelism workloads. At first\nglance, stream analytics appear a particularly poor match for HBM because they\nhave high capacity demands and data grouping operations, their most demanding\ncomputations, use random access. This paper presents the design and\nimplementation of StreamBox-HBM, a stream analytics engine that exploits hybrid\nmemories to achieve scalable high performance. StreamBox-HBM performs data\ngrouping with sequential access sorting algorithms in HBM, in contrast to\nrandom access hashing algorithms commonly used in DRAM. StreamBox-HBM solely\nuses HBM to store Key Pointer Array (KPA) data structures that contain only\npartial records (keys and pointers to full records) for grouping operations. It\ndynamically creates and manages prodigious data and pipeline parallelism,\nchoosing when to allocate KPAs in HBM. It dynamically optimizes for both the\nhigh bandwidth and limited capacity of HBM, and the limited bandwidth and high\ncapacity of standard DRAM. StreamBox-HBM achieves 110 million records per\nsecond and 238 GB/s memory bandwidth while effectively utilizing all 64 cores\nof Intel's Knights Landing, a commercial server with hybrid memory. It\noutperforms stream engines with sequential access algorithms without KPAs by 7x\nand stream engines with random access algorithms by an order of magnitude in\nthroughput.

Famously, SOC was predicted by Kane and Mele to\nstabilize a quantum spin Hall insulator; however, the weak intrinsic SOC in\nmonolayer graphene has precluded experimental observation. Here, we exploit a\nlayer-selective proximity effect---achieved via van der Waals contact to a\nsemiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide--to engineer Kane-Mele SOC in\nultra-clean \\textit{bilayer} graphene. Using high-resolution capacitance\nmeasurements to probe the bulk electronic compressibility, we find that SOC\nleads to the formation of a distinct incompressible, gapped phase at charge\nneutrality. The experimental data agrees quantitatively with a simple\ntheoretical model in which the new phase results from SOC-driven band\ninversion. In contrast to Kane-Mele SOC in monolayer graphene, the inverted\nphase is not expected to be a time reversal invariant topological insulator,\ndespite being separated from conventional band insulators by electric field\ntuned phase transitions where crystal symmetry mandates that the bulk gap must\nclose.

As a\nmathematical object, a matrix defines a linear mapping between points\nrepresenting weighted combinations of its rows (the row vector space) and\npoints representing weighted combinations of its columns (the column vector\nspace). From this perspective, a data matrix defines a relationship between the\ninformation that labels its rows and the information that labels its columns,\nand numerical methods are used to analyze this relationship. A first step is to\nnormalize the data, transforming each observation from scales convenient for\nmeasurement to a common scale, on which addition and multiplication can\nmeaningfully combine the different observations. For example, z-transformation\nrescales every variable to the same scale, standardized variation from an\nexpected value, but ignores scale differences between measured objects. Here we\ndevelop the concepts and properties of projective decomposition, which applies\nthe same normalization strategy to both rows and columns by separating the\nmatrix into row- and column-scaling factors and a scale-normalized matrix.

Recently, several powerful techniques for\nunsupervised representation learning have been demonstrated to give the\nstate-of-the-art performance in downstream tasks such as vertex classification\nand edge prediction. These techniques rely on random walks performed on the\ngraph in order to capture its structural properties. These structural\nproperties are then encoded in the vector representation space.\n  However, most contemporary representation learning methods only apply to\nstatic graphs while real-world graphs are often dynamic and change over time.\nStatic representation learning methods are not able to update the vector\nrepresentations when the graph changes; therefore, they must re-generate the\nvector representations on an updated static snapshot of the graph regardless of\nthe extent of the change in the graph. In this work, we propose computationally\nefficient algorithms for vertex representation learning that extend random walk\nbased methods to dynamic graphs.

We vary\nviscosity by using bacterial variants that secrete different amounts of\nextracellular matrix polymers, but are otherwise identical. Unlike\nthermally-driven diffusion, in which diffusivity decreases with increased\nviscosity, we find that cellular motion mediated by death and reproduction is\nindependent of viscosity over timescales relevant to bacterial reproduction.

This results in better performance compared\nto linear inversion methods, where the prior information is limited to the\n2-point covariance of the source pixels approximated with a Gaussian form, and\noften specified in a relatively arbitrary manner. We combine our source\nreconstruction network with a convolutional neural network that predicts the\nparameters of the mass distribution in the lensing galaxies directly from\ntelescope images, allowing a fully automated reconstruction of the background\nsource images and the foreground mass distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2019 03:29:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

This level of precision allows researchers\nto measure the loss of light due to exoplanet transits as well as the light\nemitted by an exoplanet, or planetary photometric emissions. The planetary\nphotometric emissions are due to the thermal emissions of the exoplanet, and\nreflected stellar light. In many cases it is assumed that the incident stellar\nlight may be modeled as plane parallel rays. For extremely close-in exoplanets\nthe finite angular size of the host star must be taken into account and the\nplane parallel ray model breaks down. One consequence of modeling the incident\nstellar radiation in this manner is the creation of three distinct zones as\nopposed to the two zones present in the plane parallel ray model. The three\nzones are the fully illuminated, penumbral, and un-illuminated zones. The\nexistence of the penumbral zone means that more than half of the exoplanet will\nbe at least partially illuminated by the host star. In this work we will\npresent a complete derivation of the reflective luminosity of the fully\nilluminated zone. In addition, we will present an outline for the derivation of\nthe reflected intensity distribution of the penumbral zone. Within this work we\nwill also derive a new expression for the thermal luminosity of an exoplanet by\ntreating each of the three zones as a blackbody emitting at a constant\ntemperature. Finally, it will be shown that an estimation of the radius of the\nexoplanet requires proper accounting of light from the penumbral zone during\nthe primary transit. Not doing so risks underestimating the radius of the\nexoplanet and an overestimation of its geometric albedo and nightside\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2019 03:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

In our HRL method, the gating policy\nlearns to select option policies based on an option-value function, and these\noption policies are optimized based on the deterministic policy gradient\nmethod.

Conventional classification\nalgorithms are not effective in the case of imbalanced data distribution, and\nmay fail when the data distribution is highly imbalanced. To address this\nissue, we propose a general imbalanced classification model based on deep\nreinforcement learning. We formulate the classification problem as a sequential\ndecision-making process and solve it by deep Q-learning network. The agent\nperforms a classification action on one sample at each time step, and the\nenvironment evaluates the classification action and returns a reward to the\nagent. The reward from minority class sample is larger so the agent is more\nsensitive to the minority class. The agent finally finds an optimal\nclassification policy in imbalanced data under the guidance of specific reward\nfunction and beneficial learning environment. Experiments show that our\nproposed model outperforms the other imbalanced classification algorithms, and\nit can identify more minority samples and has great classification performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2019 07:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

The\nplant is a nonlinear finite-dimensional system with a single control input and\na single output and it is locally exponentially stable around the origin. The\nplant is driven, via a separate disturbance input, by a Lyapunov stable\nexosystem whose states are nonwandering. The reference signal that the plant\noutput must track is a nonlinear function of the exosystem state. The local\nerror feedback regulator problem is to design a dynamic feedback controller,\nwith the tracking error as its input, such that (i) the closed-loop system of\nthe plant and the controller is locally exponentially stable, and (ii) the\ntracking error tends to zero for all sufficiently small initial conditions of\nthe plant, the controller and the exosystem. Under the assumption that the\nabove regulator problem is solvable, we propose a nonlinear controller whose\norder is relatively small - typically equal to the order of the exosystem, and\nwhich solves the regulator problem. The emphasis is on the low order of the\ncontroller. The stability assumption on the plant (which can be relaxed to some\nextent) is crucial for making it possible to design a low order controller.

The film exhibits\nuniaxial magnetic anisotropy, with its magnitude decreasing with increasing\nfilm thickness.

Significant deviation from the anisotropy energy\nexpected on the basis of theoretical considerations can be attributed to\nseveral factors like, deviation of surface topology from an ideal sinusoidal\nwave, breaks of continuity along the ripple direction, defects like pattern\ndislocations, and possible decrease in surface modulation depth with increasing\nfilm thickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2019 10:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

We also propose that the source of the field is a growing\ntoroidal electric current generated by the aberrated radiation pressure on the\ninnermost plasma electrons in orbit around the central black hole. This is the\nastrophysical mechanism of the Cosmic Battery. When the return magnetic field\noutside the toroidal electric current diffuses through the surrounding disk,\nthe disk magnetic field and its associated accretion rate gradually increase,\nthus leading the system to an outburst. After the central accretion flow\napproaches equipartition with radiation, it is disrupted, and the Cosmic\nBattery ceases to operate. The outward field diffusion is then reversed,\nmagnetic flux reconnects with the flux accumulated around the central black\nhole and disappears. The magnetic field and the associated accretion rate\nslowly decrease, and the system is gradualy driven back to quiescence.

If Max-Flow (the version with a given\nsource-sink pair $s,t$) can be solved in time $T(m)$, then an $O(n^2) \\cdot\nT(m)$ is a trivial upper bound. But can we do better?\n  For directed graphs, recent results in fine-grained complexity suggest that\nthis time bound is essentially optimal. In contrast, for undirected graphs with\nedge capacities, a seminal algorithm of Gomory and Hu (1961) runs in much\nfaster time $O(n)\\cdot T(m)$. Under the plausible assumption that Max-Flow can\nbe solved in near-linear time $m^{1+o(1)}$, this half-century old algorithm\nyields an $nm^{1+o(1)}$ bound. Several other algorithms have been designed\nthrough the years, including $\\tilde{O}(mn)$ time for unit-capacity edges\n(unconditionally), but none of them break the $O(mn)$ barrier. Meanwhile, no\nsuper-linear lower bound was shown for undirected graphs.\n  We design the first hardness reductions for All-Pairs Max-Flow in undirected\ngraphs, giving an essentially optimal lower bound for the\n$\\textit{node-capacities}$ setting. For edge capacities, our efforts to prove\nsimilar lower bounds have failed, but we have discovered a surprising new\nalgorithm that breaks the $O(mn)$ barrier for graphs with unit-capacity edges!\nAssuming $T(m)=m^{1+o(1)}$, our algorithm runs in time $m^{3/2 +o(1)}$ and\noutputs a cut-equivalent tree (similarly to the Gomory-Hu algorithm).

However, it is difficult to calculate fractal\ndimension of boundaries systematically when image data is limited. An\napproximation estimation formulae of boundary dimension based on square is\nwidely applied in urban and ecological studies. However, the boundary dimension\nis sometimes overestimated. This paper is devoted to developing a series of\npracticable formulae for boundary dimension estimation using ideas from\nfractals. A number of regular figures are employed as reference shapes, from\nwhich the corresponding geometric measure relations are constructed; from these\nmeasure relations, two sets of fractal dimension estimation formulae are\nderived for describing fractal-like boundaries. Correspondingly, a group of\nshape indexes can be defined. A finding is that different formulae have\ndifferent merits and spheres of application, and the second set of boundary\ndimensions is a function of the shape indexes. Under condition of data\nshortage, these formulae can be utilized to estimate boundary dimension values\nrapidly. Moreover, the relationships between boundary dimension and shape\nindexes are instructive to understand the association and differences between\ncharacteristic scales and scaling. The formulae may be useful for the\npre-fractal studies in geography, geomorphology, ecology, landscape science,\nand especially, urban science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2019 13:25:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 08:36:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2019 08:09:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 18 Jan 2020 09:05:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-12"}

Extending semantic segmentation\nmethods to adverse weather conditions such as fog is crucial for outdoor\napplications. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named Curriculum Model\nAdaptation (CMAda), which gradually adapts a semantic segmentation model from\nlight synthetic fog to dense real fog in multiple steps, using both labeled\nsynthetic foggy data and unlabeled real foggy data. The method is based on the\nfact that the results of semantic segmentation in moderately adverse conditions\n(light fog) can be bootstrapped to solve the same problem in highly adverse\nconditions (dense fog). CMAda is extensible to other adverse conditions and\nprovides a new paradigm for learning with synthetic data and unlabeled real\ndata. In addition, we present three other main stand-alone contributions: 1) a\nnovel method to add synthetic fog to real, clear-weather scenes using semantic\ninput; 2) a new fog density estimator; 3) a novel fog densification method to\ndensify the fog in real foggy scenes without using depth; and 4) the Foggy\nZurich dataset comprising 3808 real foggy images, with pixel-level semantic\nannotations for 40 images under dense fog.

An orthogonal pilot based beam training scheme is first\ndeveloped to reduce the number of training times, where all users can\nsimultaneously perform the beam training with the base station (BS). As the\nnumber of users increases, the same beam from the BS may point to different\nusers, leading to beam conflict and multiuser interference. Therefore, a\nquality-of-service (QoS) constrained (QC) beam allocation scheme is proposed to\nmaximize the equivalent channel gain of the QoS-satisfied users, under the\npremise that the number of the QoS-satisfied users without beam conflict is\nmaximized. To reduce the overhead of beam training, two partial beam training\nschemes, an interlaced scanning (IS) and a selection probability (SP) based\nschemes, are proposed. The overhead of beam training for the IS-based scheme\ncan be reduced by nearly half while the overhead for the SP-based scheme is\nflexible. Simulation results show that the QC-based beam allocation scheme can\neffectively mitigate the interference caused by the beam conflict and\nsignificantly improve the spectral efficiency while the IS-based and SP-based\nschemes significantly reduce the overhead of beam training at the cost of\nsacrificing spectral efficiency a little.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2019 14:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

Furthermore, we found that the model's own\nconfidence score cannot be trusted and model introspection methods (using\nsimpler models) do not help as they result in loss of predictive performance\n(reliability-explainability trade-off).

Specifically, we propose a novel pipeline that employs an ensemble\nof simpler models to reliably predict material properties. We also propose a\ntransfer learning technique and show that the performance loss due to models'\nsimplicity can be overcome by exploiting correlations among different material\nproperties. A new evaluation metric and a trust score to better quantify the\nconfidence in the predictions are also proposed. To improve the\ninterpretability, we add a rationale generator component to our framework which\nprovides both model-level and decision-level explanations.
