This is\nchallenging, especially when there are no example translations available as\nsupervision. Adversarial cycle consistency was recently proposed as a solution,\nwith beautiful and creative results, yielding much follow-up work. However,\naugmented reality applications cannot readily use such techniques to provide\nusers with compelling translations of real scenes, because the translations do\nnot have high-fidelity constraints.

Our main insight is that low-fidelity translations\ntypically escape a cycle-consistency penalty, because the back-translator\nlearns to compensate for the forward-translator's errors.

They\nform in clusters where they accrete material that is influenced by all the\nstars in the cluster. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of\nclusters of individual accretors embedded in a uniform-density wind in order to\nstudy how the accretion rates experienced by individual cluster members are\naltered by the properties of the ambient gas and the cluster itself. We study\naccretion as a function of number of cluster members, mean separation between\nthem, and size of their individual accretion radii. We determine the effect of\nthese key parameters on the aggregate and individual accretion rates, which we\ncompare to analytic predictions. We show that when the accretion radii of the\nindividual objects in the cluster substantially overlap, the surrounding gas is\neffectively accreted into the collective potential of the cluster prior to\nbeing accreted onto the individual stars. We find that individual cluster\nmembers can accrete drastically more than they would in isolation, in\nparticular when the flow is able to cool efficiently. This effect could\npotentially modify the luminosity of accreting compact objects in star clusters\nand could lead to the rejuvenation of young star clusters as well as globular\nclusters with low-inclination and low-eccentricity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 16:53:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 02:22:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

As a result, the radial (isocurvature) perturbations\naway from the trajectory are exactly massless and they freeze on superhorizon\nscales. These models are the first exact realization of the `ultra-light\nisocurvature' scenario, previously described in the literature, where a\ncombined shift symmetry emerges between the curvature and isocurvature\nperturbations and results in primordial perturbation spectra that are entirely\nconsistent with current observations. Due to the turning trajectory, the radial\nperturbation sources the tangential (curvature) perturbation and makes it grow\nlinearly in time. As a result, only one degree of freedom (i.e. the one from\nisocurvature modes) is responsible for the primordial observables at the end of\ninflation, which yields the same phenomenology as in single-field inflation. In\nparticular, isocurvature perturbations and local non-Gaussianity are highly\nsuppressed here, even if the inflationary dynamics is truly multi-field.

This\npaper studies receive antenna selection in single-input multiple-output (SIMO)\nsystems, namely the antenna-selection SIMO (AS-SIMO) systems, from the\nperspective of digital modulation. The receiver, equipped with multiple\nantennas, selects an optimal antenna subset to receive messages from the\nsingle-antenna transmitter. By assuming independent and identical distributed\n(i.i.d) flat fading Rayleigh channels, we first analyze the input-output mutual\ninformation, also referred as symmetric capacity, of AS-SIMO systems when the\nmodulation style is BPSK/QPSK/16QAM. To reduce the computation complexity of\nthe capacity, closed-form approximated expressions of the symmetric capacity\nbased on asymptotic theory are given for the first time to approach the exact\nresults.

Given the water injection or\npressure at each WDS node, finding the water flows within pipes and pumps along\nwith the pressures at all WDS nodes constitutes the water flow (WF) problem.\nThe latter entails solving a set of (non)-linear equations. We extend\nuniqueness claims on the solution to the WF equations in setups with multiple\nfixed-pressure nodes and detailed pump models. For networks without pumps, the\nWF solution is already known to be the minimizer of a convex function. The\nlatter approach is extended to networks with pumps but not in cycles, through a\nstitching algorithm. For networks with non-overlapping cycles, a provably exact\nconvex relaxation of the pressure drop equations yields a mixed-integer\nquadratically-constrained quadratic program (MI-QCQP) solver. A hybrid scheme\ncombining the MI-QCQP with the stitching algorithm can handle WDS with\noverlapping cycles, but without pumps on them.

We first describe an\nextremely simple algorithm that requires at most $\\lceil n/k\\rceil$ passes\nusing $O(nk)$ space, where $k$ is any positive integer. We then improve this\nalgorithm by using more involved techniques to reduce the number of passes to\n$\\lceil h/k\\rceil$ under similar space constraints, where $h$ is the height of\nthe computed DFS tree. In particular, this algorithm improves the bounds for\nthe case where the computed DFS tree is shallow (having $o(n)$ height).\nMoreover, this algorithm is presented as a framework that allows the\nflexibility of using any algorithm to maintain a DFS tree of a stored sparser\nsubgraph as a black box, which may be of independent interest. Both these\nalgorithms essentially demonstrate the existence of a trade-off between the\nspace and number of passes required for computing a DFS tree. Furthermore, we\nevaluate these algorithms experimentally which reveals their exceptional\nperformance in practice. For both random and real graphs, they require merely a\nfew passes even when allowed just $O(n)$ space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 18:50:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-14"}

Typically\nhalf of the destroyed star remains bound to the black hole and falls back on\nhighly eccentric orbits, forming an accretion flow which powers a luminous\nflare. In this paper we use analytical and numerical calculations to explore\nthe effect of stellar rotation on the fallback rate of material. We find that\nslowly spinning stars ($\\Omega_* \\lesssim 0.01 \\Omega_{\\rm{breakup}}$) provide\nonly a small perturbation to fallback rates found in the non-spinning case.\nHowever when the star spins faster, there can be significant effects. If the\nstar is spinning retrograde with respect to its orbit the tidal force from the\nblack hole has to spin down the star first before disrupting it, causing\ndelayed and sometimes only partial disruption events. However, if the star is\nspinning prograde this works with the tidal force and the material falls back\nsooner and with a higher peak rate. We examine the power-law index of the\nfallback curves, finding that in all cases the fallback rate overshoots the\ncanonical $t^{-5/3}$ rate briefly after the peak, with the depth of the\novershoot dependent on the stellar spin. We also find that in general the late\ntime evolution is slightly flatter than the canonical $t^{-5/3}$ rate. We\ntherefore conclude that considering the spin of the star may be important in\nmodelling observed TDE lightcurves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 19:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

The\nvariability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the ultraviolet and optical is\nusually at the few tens of per cent level over timescales of hours to weeks.\nRecently, rare, more dramatic changes to the emission from accreting SMBHs have\nbeen observed, including tidal disruption events, 'changing look' AGNs and\nother extreme variability objects. The physics behind the 're-ignition',\nenhancement and 'shut-down' of accretion onto SMBHs is not entirely understood.\nHere we present a rapid increase in ultraviolet-optical emission in the centre\nof a nearby galaxy, marking the onset of sudden increased accretion onto a\nSMBH. The optical spectrum of this flare, dubbed AT 2017bgt, exhibits a mix of\nemission features. Some are typical of luminous, unobscured AGNs, but others\nare likely driven by Bowen fluorescence - robustly linked here with\nhigh-velocity gas in the vicinity of the accreting SMBH. The spectral features\nand increased ultraviolet flux show little evolution over a period of at least\n14 months. This disfavours the tidal disruption of a star as their origin, and\ninstead suggests a longer-term event of intensified accretion. Together with\ntwo other recently reported events with similar properties, we define a new\nclass of SMBH-related flares. This has important implications for the\nclassification of different types of enhanced accretion onto SMBHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 19:56:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

To address the challenge of\nrapidly generating low-level controllers, we argue for using model-based\nreinforcement learning (MBRL) trained on relatively small amounts of\nautomatically generated (i.e., without system simulation) data.

The original ribbon group action of\nEllis-Monaghan and Moffatt restricts self-duality, -petriality, or -triality to\nthe canonical identification of a graph's edges with those of its dual,\npetrial, or trial, whereas the more natural definition allows any isomorphism.\nHere we define a new ribbon group action on ribbon graphs, using a semidirect\nproduct of the original ribbon group with a permutation group, to take\n(partial) twists and duals of ribbon graphs while also encoding graph\nisomorphisms. This brings new algebraic tools to bear on the natural\ndefinitions of self-duality etc., as a ribbon graph is a fixed point of this\nnew ribbon group action exactly when it is isomorphic to one of its (partial)\ntwisted duals. With these tools, we prove that every ribbon graph has in its\norbit an orientable embedded bouquet, whose (partial) twisted duality\nproperties propagate through the orbit. Thus, (partial) twisted duality\nproperties of all embedded graphs may be analyzed through such bouquets, for\nwhich checking isomorphism reduces to checking just dihedral group symmetries.\nPrevious research on self-duality, etc., typically focused on highly symmetric\nregular maps, but the theory here fully encompasses all cellularly embedded\ngraphs. In contrast to the few, large, very high-genus, self-trial regular maps\nfound by Wilson, and by Jones and Poultin, here we apply our framework to\ngenerate all self-trial ribbon graphs on up to seven edges. We also show how a\ngraph's automorphism group may be used to find self-dual, etc., graphs in its\norbit, thus exposing the relationship between regularity and the ribbon group\naction and, answering a question of Jones and Poulton, yielding an infinite\nfamily of self-trial graphs not arising as covers or parallel connections of\nregular maps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 20:36:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 03:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-12"}

All\nknown MPC algorithms for maximal matching either take polylogarithmic time\nwhich is considered inefficient, or require a strictly super-linear space of\n$n^{1+\\Omega(1)}$ per machine.\n  In this work, we close this gap by providing a novel analysis of an extremely\nsimple algorithm a variant of which was conjectured to work by Czumaj et al.\n[STOC'18]. The algorithm edge-samples the graph, randomly partitions the\nvertices, and finds a random greedy maximal matching within each partition.

This is the best possible approximation\nfactor under standard assumptions, culminating a long line of research.

To probe\nhow the variability signal propagates down the jet flow, we perform detailed\ntiming analyses of our data. We find that the radio jet emission shows no\nsignificant power at Fourier frequencies $f\\gtrsim0.03$ Hz (below $\\sim30$ sec\ntimescales), and that the higher frequency radio bands (9/11 GHz) are strongly\ncorrelated over a range of timescales, displaying a roughly constant time lag\nwith Fourier frequency of a few tens of seconds. However, in the lower\nfrequency radio bands (2.5/3.5 GHz) we find a significant loss of coherence\nover the same range of timescales. Further, we detect a correlation between the\nX-ray/radio emission, measuring time lags between the X-ray/radio bands on the\norder of tens of minutes. We use these lags to solve for the compact jet speed,\nfinding that the Cyg X-1 jet is more relativistic than usually assumed for\ncompact jets, where $\\beta=0.92^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$,\n($\\Gamma=2.59^{+0.79}_{-0.61}$).

Building up\non their approach, we identified the conditions that prompt inaccurate\nsolutions, and developed a new framework to avoid them, providing a reliable\nimplementation for arbitrary values of temperature (200 to $\\sim$2000 K),\npressure ($10^{-8}$ to $10^{3}$ bar), and CNO abundances ($10^{-3}$ to $\\sim\n10^{2}\\times$ solar elemental abundances), for hydrogen-dominated atmospheres.\nThe accuracy our analytic framework is better than 10% for the more abundant\nspecies that have mixing fractions larger than $10^{-10}$, whereas the accuracy\nis better than 50% for the less abundant species. Additionally, we added the\nequilibrium-abundance calculation of atomic and molecular hydrogen into the\nsystem, and explored the physical limitations of this approach. Efficient and\nreliable tools, such as this one, are highly valuable for atmospheric Bayesian\nstudies, which need to evaluate a large number of models.

Failures of such systems can lead to loss of life or property, which\nnecessitates stringent verification and validation for providing high\nassurance. Though formal verification approaches are being investigated,\ntesting remains the primary technique for assessing the dependability of such\nsystems. Due to the nature of the tasks handled by DNNs, the cost of obtaining\ntest oracle data---the expected output, a.k.a. label, for a given input---is\nhigh, which significantly impacts the amount and quality of testing that can be\nperformed. Thus, prioritizing input data for testing DNNs in meaningful ways to\nreduce the cost of labeling can go a long way in increasing testing efficacy.\nThis paper proposes using gauges of the DNN's sentiment derived from the\ncomputation performed by the model, as a means to identify inputs that are\nlikely to reveal weaknesses. We empirically assessed the efficacy of three such\nsentiment measures for prioritization---confidence, uncertainty, and\nsurprise---and compare their effectiveness in terms of their fault-revealing\ncapability and retraining effectiveness. The results indicate that sentiment\nmeasures can effectively flag inputs that expose unacceptable DNN behavior.

When the values of an array are needed,\nfor example when the values are stored to disk or displayed on screen, the\nsequence of operations required to compute these value are compiled into a\nfunction and executed.

Interpreting this mapping in terms\nof Radon-type projections provides an analytical connection between the data\nand the density with many very useful properties including stable\ninvertibility, fast computation, and significant theoretical grounding. Using\nresults from the literature in geometric inverse problems we give uniqueness\nresults and stability estimates for our methods. We subsequently extend the\nideas to address problems in manifold learning and density estimation on\nmanifolds.

However, the original inverse probability weights\nfrom the survey sample design are typically modified to account for\nnon-response, to increase efficiency by incorporating auxiliary population\ninformation, and to reduce the variability in estimates due to extreme weights.\nIt is often the case that no single set of weights can be found which\nsuccessfully incorporates all of these modifications because together they\ninduce a large number of constraints and restrictions on the feasible solution\nspace. For example, a unique combination of categorical variables may not be\npresent in the sample data, even if the corresponding population level\ninformation is available. Additional requirements for weights to fall within\nspecified ranges may also lead to fewer population level adjustments being\nincorporated. We present a framework and accompanying computational methods to\naddress this issue of constraint achievement or selection within a restricted\nspace that will produce revised weights with reasonable properties. By\ncombining concepts from generalized raking, ridge and lasso regression,\nbenchmarking of small area estimates, augmentation of state-space equations,\npath algorithms, and data-cloning, this framework simultaneously selects\nconstraints and provides diagnostics suggesting why a fully constrained\nsolution is not possible.

Most of the existing methods focus on designing some\nelaborate priors /constraints to directly regress 3D human poses based on the\ncorresponding 2D human pose-aware features or 2D pose predictions. However, due\nto the insufficient 3D pose data for training and the domain gap between 2D\nspace and 3D space, these methods have limited scalabilities for all practical\nscenarios (e.g., outdoor scene). Attempt to address this issue, this paper\nproposes a simple yet effective self-supervised correction mechanism to learn\nall intrinsic structures of human poses from abundant images. Specifically, the\nproposed mechanism involves two dual learning tasks, i.e., the 2D-to-3D pose\ntransformation and 3D-to-2D pose projection, to serve as a bridge between 3D\nand 2D human poses in a type of \"free\" self-supervision for accurate 3D human\npose estimation. The 2D-to-3D pose implies to sequentially regress intermediate\n3D poses by transforming the pose representation from the 2D domain to the 3D\ndomain under the sequence-dependent temporal context, while the 3D-to-2D pose\nprojection contributes to refining the intermediate 3D poses by maintaining\ngeometric consistency between the 2D projections of 3D poses and the estimated\n2D poses. We further apply our self-supervised correction mechanism to develop\na 3D human pose machine, which jointly integrates the 2D spatial relationship,\ntemporal smoothness of predictions and 3D geometric knowledge. Extensive\nevaluations demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of our\nframework over all the compared competing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jan 2019 04:55:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 2019 01:21:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}

Approximating arbitrary\nfamilies by $j$-juntas with small $j$ is a recent powerful technique in\nextremal set theory.\n  The weak point of all known junta approximation results is that they work in\nthe range $n>Ck$, where $C$ is an extremely fast growing function of the input\nparameters, such as the quality of approximation or the number of families we\nsimultaneously approximate.\n  We say that a family $\\mathcal F$ is {\\it shifted} if for any\n$F=\\{x_1,\\ldots, x_k\\}\\in \\mathcal F$ and any $G =\\{y_1,\\ldots, y_k\\}$ such\nthat $y_i\\le x_i$, we have $G\\in \\mathcal F$.

When the\nphysical interaction port variables are not measured directly, dynamic and\nkinematic models are required to relate the measured variables to the\ninteraction port variables. A typical example is serial manipulators with joint\ntorque sensors, where the interaction occurs at the end-effector.

Towards semi-autonomous robots,\ncapable of handling such applications, a multimodal Gaussian process regression\napproach to manipulator dynamic modelling is developed.

Other\nthan most security approaches and comparable to biological systems we accept\nthat defensive \"walls\" can be breached at several layers. Instead of hardening\nthe \"fortress\" walls we propose to make use of an (additional) active and\nadaptive defense system to attack potential intruders - an immune system that\nis inspired by the concept of a moving target defense. This \"immune system\"\nworks on two layers. On the infrastructure layer, virtual machines are\ncontinuously regenerated (cell regeneration) to wipe out even undetected\nintruders. On the application level, the vertical and horizontal attack surface\nis continuously modified to circumvent successful replays of formerly scripted\nattacks. Our evaluations with two common cloud-native reference applications in\npopular cloud service infrastructures (Amazon Web Services, Google Compute\nEngine, Azure and OpenStack) show that it is technically possible to limit the\ntime of attackers acting undetected down to minutes. Further, more than 98% of\nan attack surface can be changed automatically and minimized which makes it\nhard for intruders to replay formerly successful scripted attacks.

In particular, a critical resolution is found between\n3.91~mm and 1.95~mm, below which the mean statistics and frequency content of\nthe plume are altered by the development of a Rayleigh-Taylor instability near\nthe centerline in close proximity to the base of the plume. This shift\ncorresponds to a plume \"puffing\" frequency that is slightly higher than would\nbe predicted using empirical relationships developed for buoyant jets.\nUltimately, the high-fidelity simulations performed here are intended as a new\nvalidation dataset for the development of subgrid-scale models used in large\neddy simulations of real-world buoyancy-driven flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 18:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-31"}

Truth discovery and incentive mechanism are fundamentally important for\nthe crowdsourcing system. Many truth discovery methods and incentive mechanisms\nfor crowdsourcing have been proposed. However, most of them cannot be applied\nto deal with the crowdsourcing with copiers. To address the issue, we formulate\nthe problem of maximizing the social welfare such that all tasks can be\ncompleted with the least confidence for truth discovery. We design an incentive\nmechanism consisting truth discovery stage and reverse auction stage. In truth\ndiscovery stage, we estimate the truth for each task based on both the\ndependence and accuracy of workers. In reverse auction stage, we design a\ngreedy algorithm to select the winners and determine the payment. Through both\nrigorous theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that\nthe proposed mechanisms achieve computational efficiency, individual\nrationality, truthfulness, and guaranteed approximation. Moreover, our truth\ndiscovery method shows prominent advantage in terms of precision when there are\ncopiers in the crowdsourcing systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jan 2019 08:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}
