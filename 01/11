We use layered binary trees to encode flags of\nadjoint arrangement faces, allowing for the representation of certain Lie\nelements by antisymmetrized layered binary forests.

The discrete derivative then induces an action of layered\nbinary forests on piecewise-constant functions, which we call the forest\nderivative.

The second is to show that horizontal flows, which\nare derived from intensities or Vz/Vdop flows, are in good agreement, and that\nthis is the case for observations and numerical simulations. The third\nobjective is to apply this new Vz-based method to a 3D simulation to probe\nrelationships between horizontal surface flows, TFG, and deep vertical motions.\nThe TFG were detected after oscillation filtering of intensities or Vz/Vdop\nflows, using a segmentation and labelling technique. Surface horizontal flows\nwere derived from local correlation tracking (LCT) and from intensities or\nVz/Vdop flows. These methods were applied to Hinode observations, 2D surface\nresults of a first simulation, and 3D Vz data of a second simulation. We find\nthat TFG and horizontal surface flows (provided by the LCT) can be detected\neither from intensities or Vz/Vdop component, for high resolution observations\nand numerical simulations. We apply this method to a 3D run providing the Vz\ncomponent in depth. This reveals a close relationship between surface TFG (5 Mm\nmesoscale) and vertical downflows 5 Mm below the surface. We suggest that the\ndynamics of TFG form larger scales (the 15-20 Mm supergranulation) associated\nwith 15 Mm downflowing cells below the surface. The TFG and associated surface\nflows seem to be essential to understanding the formation and evolution of the\nnetwork at the meso and supergranular scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 16:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}

On the other hand, the metric\nemergence of a particular reference measure (usually Lebesgue) quantifies how\nnon-ergodic this measure is. We prove fundamental properties of these two\nemergences, relating them with classical concepts such as Kolmogorov's\n$\\epsilon$-entropy of metric spaces and quantization of measures. We also\nrelate the two types of emergences by means of a variational principle.\nFurthermore, we provide several examples of dynamics with high emergence.\nFirst, we show that the topological emergence of some standard classes of\nhyperbolic dynamical systems is essentially the maximal one allowed by the\nambient. Secondly, we construct examples of smooth area-preserving\ndiffeomorphisms that are extremely non-ergodic in the sense that the metric\nemergence of the Lebesgue measure is essentially maximal.

A common assumption in previous\napproaches to quantifying such risk is that the $k$ initiating component\noutages are statistically independent events. However, when triggered by a\ncommon exogenous cause, initiating outages may actually be correlated. Here,\ncopula analysis is used to quantify the impact of correlation of initiating\noutages on the risk of cascading failure. The method is demonstrated on two\ntest cases; a 2383-bus model of the Polish grid under varying load conditions\nand a synthetic 10,000-bus model based on the geography of the Western US. The\nlarge size of the Western US test case required development of new approaches\nfor bounding an estimate of the total number of N-3 blackout-causing\ncontingencies.

The\nfirst ever gravitational-wave detection from the coalescence of two neutron\nstars, GW170817, and its gamma-ray counterpart, GRB 170817A, led to an\nelectromagnetic follow-up of the event at an unprecedented scale. Several teams\nfrom across the world searched for EM/neutrino counterparts to GW170817, paving\nthe way for the discovery of optical, X-ray, and radio counterparts. In this\narticle, we describe the online identification of gravitational-wave transients\nand the distribution of gravitational-wave alerts by the LIGO and Virgo\ncollaborations during O2. We also describe the gravitational-wave observables\nwhich were sent in the alerts to enable searches for their counterparts.\nFinally, we give an overview of the online candidate alerts shared with\nobserving partners during O2. Alerts were issued for 14 candidates, six of\nwhich have been confirmed as gravitational-wave events associated with the\nmerger of black holes or neutron stars. Eight of the 14 alerts were issued less\nthan an hour after data acquisition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 18:28:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 13:55:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 20:58:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 22:06:28 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 15:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

Numerous methods have been\nproposed for the solution of RBDO, a complex problem that combines optimization\nand reliability analysis. Classical approaches are based on approximation\nmethods and have been classified in review papers. In this paper, we first\nreview classical approaches based on approximation methods such as FORM, and\nalso more recent methods that rely upon surrogate modelling and Monte Carlo\nsimulation. We then propose a general framework for the solution of RBDO\nproblems that includes three independent blocks, namely adaptive surrogate\nmodelling, reliability analysis and optimization. These blocks are\nnon-intrusive with respect to each other and can be plugged independently in\nthe framework. After a discussion on numerical considerations that require\nattention for the framework to yield robust solutions to various types of\nproblems, the latter is applied to three examples (using two analytical\nfunctions and a finite element model). Kriging and support vector machines\ntogether with their own active learning schemes are considered in the surrogate\nmodel block. In terms of reliability analysis, the proposed framework is\nillustrated using both crude Monte Carlo and subset simulation. Finally, the\ncovariance-matrix adaptation - evolution scheme (CMA-ES), a global search\nalgorithm, or sequential quadratic programming (SQP), a local gradient-based\nmethod, are used in the optimization block. The comparison of the results to\nbenchmark studies show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed\nframework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 18:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-11"}

The first order\napproximate black hole solutions with arbitrary boundary topology $k$ are\npresented, and in addition, the second order approximate planar black holes are\nexhibited as well. We then establish the holographic dictionary for such\ntheories by presenting $a$-charge, $C_T$-charge and energy flux parameters\n$t_2$ and $t_4$. By perturbatively discussing the holographic R\\'enyi entropy,\nwe find $a$, $C_T$ and $t_4$ can somehow determine the R\\'enyi entropy with the\nlimit $q\\rightarrow 1$, $q\\rightarrow 0$ and $q\\rightarrow \\infty$ up to the\nfirst order, where $q$ is the order of the R\\'enyi entropy. For holographic\nhydrodynamics, we discuss the shear-viscosity-entropy-ratio and find that the\npatterns deviating from the KSS bound $1/(4\\pi)$ can somehow be controlled by\n$((c-a)/c,t_4)$ up to the first order in $D=5$, and\n$((\\mathcal{C}_T-\\tilde{a})/\\mathcal{C}_T,t_4)$ up to the second order in\n$D=4$, where $\\mathcal{C}_T$ and $\\tilde{a}$ differ from $C_T$-charge and\n$a$-charge by inessential overall constants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 19:03:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 2019 10:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

The\nchirality is manifested by the presence of surface Fermi arcs connecting the\nprojections of nodes with opposite Chern numbers. In addition to the well-known\nWeyl nodes, theorists have proposed several other types of chiral topological\nnodes in condensed matter systems, but the direct experimental evidence of\ntheir existence is still lacking. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy, we reveal two types of new chiral nodes, namely the spin-1 nodes\nand charge-2 Dirac nodes, at the band crossing points near the Fermi level in\nCoSi, the projections of which on the (001) surface are connected by\ntopologically protected surface Fermi arcs. As these chiral nodes in CoSi are\nenforced at the Brillouin zone (BZ) center and corner by the crystalline\nsymmetries, the surface Fermi arcs connecting their projections form a\nnon-contractible path traversing the entire (001) surface BZ, in sharp contrast\nto pairs of Weyl nodes with small separation.

By a theorem of McNaughton and Papert, these are\nalso the first-order definable languages. The dot-depth rose to prominence\nfollowing the work of Thomas, who proved an exact correspondence with the\nquantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic: each level in the\ndot-depth hierarchy consists of all languages that can be defined with a\nprescribed number of quantifier blocks. One of the most famous open problems in\nautomata theory is to settle whether the membership problem is decidable for\neach level: is it possible to decide whether an input regular language belongs\nto this level?\n  Despite a significant research effort, membership by itself has only been\nsolved for low levels. A recent breakthrough was achieved by replacing\nmembership with a more general problem: separation. Given two input languages,\none has to decide whether there exists a third language in the investigated\nlevel containing the first language and disjoint from the second. The\nmotivation is that: (1) while more difficult, separation is more rewarding (2)\nit provides a more convenient framework (3) all recent membership algorithms\nare reductions to separation for lower levels.\n  We present a separation algorithm for dot-depth two. While this is our most\nprominent application, our result is more general. We consider a family of\nhierarchies that includes the dot-depth: concatenation hierarchies. They are\nbuilt via a generic construction process. One first chooses an initial class,\nthe basis, which is the lowest level in the hierarchy. Further levels are built\nby applying generic operations. Our main theorem states that for any\nconcatenation hierarchy whose basis is finite, separation is decidable for\nlevel one. In the special case of the dot-depth, this can be lifted to level\ntwo using previously known results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 20:02:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2019 15:03:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 15:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 22:06:45 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 11:33:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

We examine the\neffects of disorder on the TE properties of semiconducting polymers based on\nthe Gaussian disorder model (GDM) for site energies while employing Pauli's\nmaster equation approach to model hopping between localized sites. Our model is\nin good agreement with experimental results and a useful tool to study hopping\ntransport. We show that stronger overlap between sites can improve the\nelectrical conductivity without adversely affecting the Seebeck coefficient. We\nfind that positional disorder aids the formation of new conduction paths with\nan increased probability of carriers in high energy sites leading to a\nsimultaneous increase in electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. On\nthe other hand, energetic disorder leads to increased energy gap between sites,\nhindering transport, and adversely affects both conductivity and Seebeck.\nFurthermore, positional correlation primarily affects conductivity, while\ncorrelation in energy has no effect on TE properties of polymers. Our results\nalso show that the Lorenz number increases with Seebeck coefficient, largely\ndeviating from the Sommerfeld value, in agreement with experiments and in\ncontrast to band conductors. We conclude that reducing energetic disorder while\nincreasing positional disorder can lead to higher TE power factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 20:20:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 16:41:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-15"}

For the nonnegative cost\nmodel and an unbounded cost model, we introduce a set of conditions under which\nwe prove the average cost optimality inequality (ACOI) via the vanishing\ndiscount factor approach. Unlike most existing results on the ACOI, which\nrequire compactness/continuity conditions on the MDP, our result does not and\ncan be applied to problems with discontinuous dynamics and one-stage costs. The\nkey idea here is to replace the compactness/continuity conditions used in the\nprior work by what we call majorization type conditions. In particular, among\nothers, we require that for each state, on selected subsets of actions at that\nstate, the state transition stochastic kernel is majorized by finite measures,\nand we use this majorization property together with Egoroff's theorem to prove\nthe ACOI.\n  We also consider the minimum pair approach for average-cost MDPs and apply\nthe majorization idea. For the case of a discrete action space and strictly\nunbounded costs, we prove the existence of a minimum pair that consists of a\nstationary policy and an invariant probability measure induced by the policy.\nThis result is derived by combining Lusin's theorem with another majorization\ncondition we introduce, and it can be applied to a class of countable action\nspace MDPs in which, with respect to the state variable, the dynamics and\none-stage costs are discontinuous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 20:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-14"}

They are designed to keep persistence, security, and avoid\nattacks which is useful for many applications. However, they are still\nproblematic in their energy consumption, governance, and scalability Current\nsolutions either require vast computing power via Proof-of-Work (PoW) or cannot\ndirectly utilize computing power as a resource in virtual mining. Here, we\npropose incentive-based protocols that use competitions to integrate computing\npower into blockchains. We introduce Proof-of-Accumulated-Work (PoAW): miners\ncompete in costumer-submitted jobs, accumulate recorded work whenever they are\nsuccessful, and, over time, are remunerated. The underlying competition\nreplaces the standard hash puzzle-based competitions of PoW. A competition is\nmanaged by a dynamically-created small masternode network (dTMN) of invested\nminers. dTMNs allow for scalability as we do not need the entire network to\nmanage the competition. Using careful design on incentives, our system\npreserves security, avoids attacks, and offers new markets to miners. When\nthere are no costumers the system converges into a standard protocol. Our\nproposed solution improves the way by which the blockchain infrastructure works\nand makes use of its computing power. We also discuss how the protocol can be\nused by fields that require solving difficult optimization problems, such as\nArtificial Intelligence and Pattern Recognition in Big Data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 20:34:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-14"}

Extensions have a permanent storage in which they can store data\nand can trigger the download of arbitrary files on the user's device.

However, the SISR for medical images is still a very challenging\nproblem.

We propose the use of DNN for k-step channel prediction\nfor space-time block code (STBC)s, and show that deep learning (DL)-based DD-CE\ncan removes the need for Doppler spread estimation in fast time-varying quasi\nstationary channels, where the Doppler spread varies from one packet to\nanother. Doppler spread estimation in this kind of vehicular channels is\nremarkably challenging and requires a large number of pilots and preambles,\nleading to lower power and spectral efficiency. We train two DNNs which learn\nreal and imaginary parts of the MIMO fading channels over a wide range of\nDoppler spreads. We demonstrate that by those DNNs, DD-CE can be realized with\nonly rough priori knowledge about Doppler spread range. For the proposed DD-CE\nalgorithm, we also analytically derive the maximum likelihood (ML) decoding\nalgorithm for STBC transmission.

However, in particular, the\nreconstructed image usually suffers from complex artifacts and noise, when the\nsampling is insufficient. In order to deal such issue, a full-automatic\nreconstruction (FAR) net is proposed for sparse-views CT reconstruction via\ndeep learning technique. Different with the usual network in deep learning\nreconstruction, the proposed neural network is an End-to-End network by which\nthe image is predicted directly from projection data. The main challenge for\nsuch a FAR net is the space complexity of the CT reconstruction in\nfull-connected (FC) network. For a CT image with the size $N \\times N$ , a\ntypical requirement of memory space for the image reconstruction is $O(N^{4})$,\nfor which is unacceptable by conventional calculation device, e.g. GPU\nworkstation. In this paper, we utilize a series of smaller FC layers to replace\nthe huge based on the sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) theory. By\napplying such an approach, the FAR net is able to reconstruct sparse-views CT\nimages with the size $512\\times 512$ on only one workstation. Furthermore, a\nRes-Unet structure is composed in the FAR net for suppressing the artifacts and\nnoise caused by under-sampling data. The results of numerical experiments show\nthat the projection matrix and the FAR net is able to reconstruct the CT image\nfrom sparse-views projection data with a superior quality than conventional\nmethod such as FBP and optimization based approach. Meanwhile, the\nfactorization for the inverse projection matrix is validated in numerical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 02:05:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 12:39:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-08"}

In this work,\nusing only regular lithography techniques on a conventional GaAs quantum well,\nwe realise an electrically triggered single-photon source with a GHz repetition\nrate and without the need for spectral filtering. In this device, a single\nelectron is carried in the potential minimum of a surface acoustic wave (SAW)\nand is transported to a region of holes to form an exciton. The exciton then\ndecays and creates a single photon in a lifetime of ~ 100ps.

Then we applied this\nto the study of local biholomorphisms preserving the real group orbits on $G/P$\nand showed that such a map extend to a global biholomorphism if the real group\norbit admits a non-trivial holomorphic cover by the $Q$-cycles. The non-closed\nboundary orbits of a bounded symmetric domain embedded in its compact dual are\nexamples of such real group orbits. Finally, using the results of Mok-Zhang on\nSchubert rigidity, we also established a Cartan-Fubini type extension theorem\npertaining to $Q$-cycles, saying that if a local biholomorphism preserves the\nvariety of tangent spaces of $Q$-cycles, then it extends to a global\nbiholomorphism when the $Q$-cycles are positive dimensional and $G/P$ is of\nPicard number 1. This generalizes a well-known theorem of Hwang-Mok on minimal\nrational curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 03:41:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-14"}

By\nconsidering points in $\\mathcal{X}$ as pixels and indices of the minimal\nsurfaces as labels, we recast the problem as an image segmentation problem,\nwhich assigns a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same\nlabel share certain characteristics.

For that purpose,\nwe wish to analyze first the dielectric responses of the medium both in\npresence and absence of strong magnetic field. We found that for slow moving\npartons, the real part of dielectric function is not affected by the magnetic\nfield whereas for fast moving partons, for small $|\\textbf{k}|$, it becomes\nvery large and approaches towards its counterpart at $B=0$, for large\n$|\\textbf{k}|$. On the other hand the imaginary part is decreased for both slow\nand fast moving partons, due to the fact that the imaginary contribution due to\nquark-loop vanishes. With these ingredients, we found that the oscillation in\nthe (scaled) induced charge density, due to the very fast partons becomes less\npronounced in the presence of strong magnetic field whereas for smaller parton\nvelocity, no significant change is observed. For the (scaled) wake potential\nalong the motion of fast moving partons (which is of Lennard-Jones (LJ) type),\nthe depth of negative minimum in the backward region gets reduced drastically,\nresulting in the reduction of the amplitude of oscillation. On the other hand\nin the forward region, it remains as the screened Coulomb one, except the\nscreening now becomes much stronger for higher parton velocity. Similarly for\nthe wake potential transverse to the motion of partons in both forward and\nbackward regions, the depth of LJ potential for fast moving partons gets\ndecreased severely, but still retains the forward-backward symmetry.

In particular, we\ngive a quick development of the stochastic equations of the processes and some\nimmediate applications. The proofs given here are more elementary than those\nappearing in the literature before. We have made them readable without\nrequiring too much preliminary knowledge on branching processes and stochastic\nanalysis. In Section 1, we review some properties of Laplace transforms of\nfinite measures on the positive half line. In Section 2, a construction of\nCB-processes is given as rescaling limits of Galton--Watson branching\nprocesses. This approach also gives the physical interpretation of the\nCB-processes. Some basic properties of the processes are developed in Section\n3. The Laplace transforms of some positive integral functionals are calculated\nexplicitly in Section 4. In Section 5, the CBI-processes are constructed as\nrescaling limits of Galton--Watson branching processes with immigration. In\nSection 6, we present reconstructions of the CB- and CBI-processes by Poisson\nrandom measures determined by entrance laws, which reveal the structures of the\ntrajectories of the processes. Several equivalent formulations of martingale\nproblems for CBI-processes are given in Section 7. From those we derive the\nstochastic equations of the processes in Section 8. Using the stochastic\nequations, some characterizations of local and global maximal jumps of the CB-\nand CBI-processes are given in Section 9.

Most of the research has been focused on\nthe task of image transformation for a set of pre-defined domains. Very few\nworks are reported that actually developed a common framework for\nimage-to-image transformation for different domains. With the introduction of\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) as a general framework for the image\ngeneration problem, there is a tremendous growth in the area of image-to-image\ntransformation.

Background subtraction is then applied in\norder to separate the background and the foreground. In literature, background\nsubtraction is surely among the most investigated field in computer vision\nproviding a big amount of publications. Most of them concern the application of\nmathematical and machine learning models to be more robust to the challenges\nmet in videos. However, the ultimate goal is that the background subtraction\nmethods developed in research could be employed in real applications like\ntraffic surveillance. But looking at the literature, we can remark that there\nis often a gap between the current methods used in real applications and the\ncurrent methods in fundamental research. In addition, the videos evaluated in\nlarge-scale datasets are not exhaustive in the way that they only covered a\npart of the complete spectrum of the challenges met in real applications. In\nthis context, we attempt to provide the most exhaustive survey as possible on\nreal applications that used background subtraction in order to identify the\nreal challenges met in practice, the current used background models and to\nprovide future directions. Thus, challenges are investigated in terms of\ncamera, foreground objects and environments. In addition, we identify the\nbackground models that are effectively used in these applications in order to\nfind potential usable recent background models in terms of robustness, time and\nmemory requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 12:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-14"}

It is known that this problem is fixed-parameter tractable and admits a\npolynomial kernel when parameterized by $k$. A caveat for this parameter is\nthat it needs to be large, i.e., at least equal to half the size of a maximum\nmatching of $G$, for instances not to be trivially negative. Motivated by this,\nwe study the existence of polynomial kernels for EDS when parameterized by\nstructural parameters that may be much smaller than $k$.\n  Unfortunately, at first glance this looks rather hopeless: Even when\nparameterized by the deletion distance to a disjoint union of paths $P_3$ of\nlength two there is no polynomial kernelization (under standard assumptions),\nruling out polynomial kernels for many smaller parameters like the feedback\nvertex set size.

In\nthis work, we take a first step to tackle this issue by leveraging explainable\nmachine-learning algorithms developed to interpret the black-box decisions of\ndeep neural networks. In particular, we use an explainable technique known as\nfeature attribution to identify the most influential input features\ncontributing to each decision, and adapt it to provide meaningful explanations\nto the classification of malware binaries. In this case, we find that a\nrecently-proposed convolutional neural network does not learn any meaningful\ncharacteristic for malware detection from the data and text sections of\nexecutable files, but rather tends to learn to discriminate between benign and\nmalware samples based on the characteristics found in the file header. Based on\nthis finding, we propose a novel attack algorithm that generates adversarial\nmalware binaries by only changing few tens of bytes in the file header. With\nrespect to the other state-of-the-art attack algorithms, our attack does not\nrequire injecting any padding bytes at the end of the file, and it is much more\nefficient, as it requires manipulating much fewer bytes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 14:02:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 08:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-25"}

Our paper goes beyond these results and shows novel properties\nthat hold under He initialization: i) the norm of hidden activation of each\nlayer is equal to the norm of the input, and, ii) the norm of weight gradient\nof each layer is equal to the product of norm of the input vector and the error\nat output layer. These results are derived using the PAC analysis framework,\nand hold true for finitely sized datasets such that the width of the ReLU\nnetwork only needs to be larger than a certain finite lower bound.

The jammer is used to improve\neither the weighted sum secure rate or the overall system fairness. The\nformulated optimization problem in both the cases is a mixed integer non-linear\nprogramming problem, belonging to the class of NP-hard. In the sum secure rate\nmaximization scenario, we decouple the problem and first obtain the subcarrier\nallocation at source and the decision for jammer power utilization on a\nper-subcarrier basis. Then, we do joint source and jammer power allocation\nusing primal decomposition and alternating optimization framework. Next, we\nconsider fair resource allocation by introducing a novel concept of subcarrier\nsnatching with the help of jammer. We propose two schemes for jammer power\nutilization, called proactively fair allocation (PFA) and on-demand allocation\n(ODA). PFA considers equitable distribution of jammer power among the\nsubcarriers, while ODA distributes jammer power based on the user demand. In\nboth cases of jammer usage, we also present suboptimal solutions that solve the\npower allocation at a highly reduced complexity. Asymptotically optimal\nsolutions are derived to benchmark optimality of the proposed schemes. We\ncompare the performance of our proposed schemes with equal power allocation at\nsource and jammer.

Moreover, many of the algorithms\nproposed in the literature to learn the structure and parameters of SPNs are\nreadily available in SPFlow. Furthermore, SPFlow is extremely extensible and\ncustomizable, allowing users to promptly distill new inference and learning\nroutines by injecting custom code into a lightweight functional-oriented API\nframework.

As such, the disentropy can be used everywhere entropy is\nused, offering a different point of view: since entropy is a measure of\ndisorder or uncertainty, disentropy is a measure of order or certainty. Thus,\nimportant concepts of physics can be rewritten using disentropy instead of\nentropy. Although there is a large range of problems that can be solved using\nentropy or disentropy, there are situations where only the disentropy can be\nused. This happens because the disentropy can provide a real output value when\nits argument is negative, while the entropy cannot. Thus, it is possible to\ncalculate, for example, the disentropy of quasi-probability distributions like\nthe Wigner function of highly quantum states.

The ANN process itself uses the brute-force approach that\nautomatically partitions the training data into 10 sub-samples, builds the ANN\nmodels in these samples and evaluates their performance using multiple metrics.\nThe results show the superiority of 1-month lag of the variables as compared to\nlonger time lags of 2 and 3 months. The champion ANN model recorded an R2 of\n0.78 in model testing using the out-of-sample data. This illustrates its\nability to be a good predictor of drought situations 1-month ahead.\nInvestigated as a classifier, the champion has a modest accuracy of 66% and a\nmulti-class area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 89.99%\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 20:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-16"}
