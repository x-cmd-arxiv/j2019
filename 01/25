The evolving distribution that asymptotically converges to the target\ndistribution is governed by a vector field, which is the negative gradient of\nthe first variation of the $f$-divergence between them. We prove that the\nevolving distribution coincides with the pushforward distribution through the\ninfinitesimal time composition of residual maps that are perturbations of the\nidentity map along the vector field. The vector field depends on the density\nratio of the pushforward distribution and the target distribution, which can be\nconsistently learned from a binary classification problem. Connections of our\nproposed VGrow method with other popular methods, such as VAE, GAN and\nflow-based methods, have been established in this framework, gaining new\ninsights of deep generative learning. We also evaluated several commonly used\ndivergences, including Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon, Jeffrey divergences as\nwell as our newly discovered `logD' divergence which serves as the objective\nfunction of the logD-trick GAN.

This work is motivated by\nrecent theoretical studies and experimental works on heat currents in quantum\ndot circuits. As expected intuitively, within the (static) mean-field\napproximation, the system at steady-state decouples into two single-dot\nequilibrium systems with renormalized dot energies, leading to zero average\nheat flux and fluctuations. This reveals that dynamic correlations induced\nbetween electrons on the dots is solely responsible for the heat transport\nbetween the two reservoirs. To study heat current fluctuations, we compute\nsteady-state cumulant generating function for heat exchanged between reservoirs\nusing two approaches : Lindblad quantum master equation approach, which is\nvalid for arbitrary coulomb interaction strength but weak system-reservoir\ncoupling strength, and the saddle point approximation for Schwinger-Keldysh\ncoherent state path integral, which is valid for arbitrary system-reservoir\ncoupling strength but weak coulomb interaction strength. Using thus obtained\ngenerating functions, we verify steady-state fluctuation theorem for stochastic\nheat flux and study the average heat current and its fluctuations.

We present sufficient conditions in terms of\nmultiple Lyapunov functions for the origin of the system to be finite time\nstable. More specifically, we show that even if the value of the Lyapunov\nfunction increases in between two switches, i.e., if there are unstable modes\nin the system, finite-time stability can still be guaranteed if the finite time\nconvergent mode is active long enough. In contrast to earlier work where the\nLyapunov functions are required to be decreasing during the continuous flows\nand non-increasing at the discrete jumps, we allow the Lyapunov functions to\nincrease \\emph{both} during the continuous flows and the discrete jumps. As\nthus, the derived stability results are less conservative compared to the\nearlier results in the related literature, and in effect allow the hybrid\nsystem to have unstable modes. Then, we illustrate how the proposed finite-time\nstability conditions specialize for a class of switched systems, and present a\nmethod on the synthesis of a finite-time stabilizing switching signal for\nswitched linear systems.

The presence of repeating\nbursts in FRB 121102 allowed us to perform a precise localization of the source\nwith the Very Large Array and the European VLBI Network (EVN). Optical\nobservations with Keck, Gemini and HST unveiled the host to be a\nlow-metallicity star-forming dwarf galaxy located at a redshift of 0.193.

This environment resembles the ones\nwhere superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) or long gamma-ray bursts are produced.\nAlthough the nature of this persistent source and the origin of the bursts\nremain unknown, scenarios considering a pulsar/magnetar energizing a young\nSLSN, or a system with a pulsar/magnetar in the vicinity of a massive black\nhole are the most plausible ones to date. More recent observations have shown\nthat the bursts from FRB 121102 are almost 100% linearly polarized at an\nunexpectedly high and variable Faraday rotation measure, that has been observed\nto date only in vicinities of massive black holes.

Models of this IGE have to be very\naccurate for interpreting the high-quality observations by present gamma-ray\ntelescopes, such as Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Standard models of IGE,\nused as reference models for analyses of the Fermi LAT data, show spatial\ndiscrepancies with respect to the data, underlining the necessity of more\nrealistic models. The same CR electrons that produce the inverse-Compton\ncomponent of the IGE produce also interstellar synchrotron emission observed in\nradio and microwave. However, present standard models do not take advantage of\nresults coming from studies of this interstellar synchrotron emission.\n  Accounting for such results, in this work we show how they affect the\ncalculated spatial maps of the large-scale inverse-Compton component of the\nIGE, which are usually used in studies of Fermi LAT data.\n  It is found that these results significantly affect these spatial model maps\neven at a 60% level.

The resulting\nintense heating strongly disturbs the chromospheric structure, and induces\ncomplex radiation hydrodynamic effects. Interpreting the physics of the flaring\nsolar atmosphere is one of the most challenging tasks in solar physics. Here we\npresent a novel deep learning approach, an invertible neural network, to\nunderstanding the chromospheric physics of a flaring solar atmosphere via the\ninversion of observed solar line profiles in H{\\alpha} and Ca II {\\lambda}8542.\nOur network is trained using flare simulations from the 1D radiation\nhydrodynamics code RADYN as the expected atmosphere and line profile. This\nmodel is then applied to single pixels from an observation of an M1.1 solar\nflare taken with SST/CRISP instrument just after the flare onset. The inverted\natmospheres obtained from observations provide physical information on the\nelectron number density, temperature and bulk velocity flow of the plasma\nthroughout the solar atmosphere ranging from 0-10 Mm in height. The density and\ntemperature profiles appear consistent with the expected atmospheric response,\nand the bulk plasma velocity provides the gradients needed to produce the broad\nspectral lines whilst also predicting the expected chromospheric evaporation\nfrom flare heating.

The aim\nof this study is to explore the feasibility of developing a Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM)-based model for the respiratory signal prediction. To achieve\nthat, 1703 sets of Real-Time Position Management data were collected from\nretrospective studies across three clinical institutions.

The dayside of\nWASP-18b emerges as completely cloud-free due to the very high atmospheric\ntemperatures.

Dynamic and\nagile maneuvers of animals cannot be imitated by existing methods that are\ncrafted by humans. A compelling alternative is reinforcement learning, which\nrequires minimal craftsmanship and promotes the natural evolution of a control\npolicy. However, so far, reinforcement learning research for legged robots is\nmainly limited to simulation, and only few and comparably simple examples have\nbeen deployed on real systems. The primary reason is that training with real\nrobots, particularly with dynamically balancing systems, is complicated and\nexpensive. In the present work, we introduce a method for training a neural\nnetwork policy in simulation and transferring it to a state-of-the-art legged\nsystem, thereby leveraging fast, automated, and cost-effective data generation\nschemes. The approach is applied to the ANYmal robot, a sophisticated\nmedium-dog-sized quadrupedal system. Using policies trained in simulation, the\nquadrupedal machine achieves locomotion skills that go beyond what had been\nachieved with prior methods: ANYmal is capable of precisely and\nenergy-efficiently following high-level body velocity commands, running faster\nthan before, and recovering from falling even in complex configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 21:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-28"}

Since then\nalternatives to the general theory of relativity like the Brans-Dicke theory,\nscalar-tensor theories of gravity and their higher derivative generalizations\n-- collectively known as Horndeski theories -- have acquired renewed interest.\nIn the present review we discuss on several selected topics regarding these\ntheories, mainly from the theoretical perspective but with due mention of the\nobservational aspect. Among the topics covered in this review we pay special\nattention to the following: 1) the asymptotic dynamics of cosmological models\nbased in the Brans-Dicke, scalar-tensor and Horndeski theories, 2) inflationary\nmodels, extended quintessence and the Galileons, with emphasis in causality and\nstability issues, 3) the chameleon and Vainshtein screening mechanisms that may\nallow the elusive scalar field to evade the tight observational constraints\nimplied by the solar system experiments, 4) the conformal frames conundrum with\na brief discussion on the disformal transformations and 5) the role of Weyl\nsymmetry and scale invariance in the gravitation theories.

The\ncomplex astrophysics involved in core-collapse supernovae pose a significant\nchallenge to modeling such phenomena. The Supernova Model Evidence Extractor\n(SMEE) attempts to capture the main features of gravitational wave signals from\ncore-collapse supernovae by using numerical relativity waveforms to create\napproximate models. These models can then be used to perform Bayesian model\nselection to determine if the targeted astrophysical feature is present in the\ngravitational wave signal. In this paper, we extend SMEE's model selection\ncapabilities to include features in the gravitational wave signal that are\nassociated with g-modes and the standing accretion shock instability.

How to perform the array processing\nin a power efficient manner is a fundamental challenge. Analog and hybrid BF\nrequire fewer analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (ADCs and\nDACs), but can only communicate in a small number of directions at a time,\nlimiting directional search, spatial multiplexing and control signaling.\nDigital BF enables flexible spatial processing, but must be operated at a low\nquantization resolution to stay within reasonable power levels. This decrease\nin quantizer resolution introduces noise in the received signal and degrades\nthe quality of the transmitted signal. To assess the effect of low-resolution\nquantization on cellular system, we present a simple additive white Gaussian\nnoise (AWGN) model for quantization noise. Simulations with this model reveal\nthat at moderate resolutions (3-4 bits per ADC), there is negligible loss in\ndownlink cellular capacity from quantization. In essence, the low-resolution\nADCs limit the high SNR, where cellular systems typically do not operate. For\nthe transmitter, it is shown that DACs with 4 or more bits of resolution do not\nviolate the adjacent carrier leakage limit set by 3-rd Generation Partnership\nProject (3GPP) New Radio (NR) standards for cellular operations. Further, this\nwork studies the effect of low resolution quantization on the error vector\nmagnitude (EVM) of the transmitted signal.In fact, our findings suggests that\nlow-resolution fully digital BF architectures can be a power efficient\nalternative to analog or hybrid beamforming for both transmitters and receivers\nat millimeter wave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jan 2019 23:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-28"}

It is a challenging task\non how to use these two types of information to explore structural\nregularities. In this paper, by characterizing potential relationship between\nlink communities and node attributes, a principled statistical model named\nPSB_PG that generates link topology and node attributes is proposed. This model\nfor generating links is based on the stochastic blockmodels following a Poisson\ndistribution. Therefore, it is capable of detecting a wide range of network\nstructures including community structures, bipartite structures and other\nmixture structures. The model for generating node attributes assumes that node\nattributes are high dimensional and sparse and also follow a Poisson\ndistribution.

For\nhomogeneous space-time modulated media, the time periodic circuit approach\nallows the extension of the well-known telegraphist's equations. The time\nharmonics are coupled together to form an infinite system of coupled\ndifferential equations.

In all the models of bribery\nstudied so far, the briber has to pay every voter some amount of money\ndepending on what the briber wants the voter to report and the briber has some\nbudget at her disposal. Although these models successfully capture many real\nworld applications, in many other scenarios, the voters may be unwilling to\ndeviate too much from their true preferences.

Furthermore, in some problems, the data type of multiple\nviews might be different. In a web classification problem, for instance, we\nmight be provided an image and text mixed data set, where the web pages are\ncharacterized by both images and texts. A common strategy to solve this kind of\nproblem is to leverage the consistency of views and the relatedness of tasks to\nbuild the prediction model. In the context of deep neural network, multi-task\nrelatedness is usually realized by grouping tasks at each layer, while\nmulti-view consistency is usually enforced by finding the maximal correlation\ncoefficient between views. However, there is no existing deep learning\nalgorithm that jointly models task and view dual heterogeneity, particularly\nfor a data set with multiple modalities (text and image mixed data set or text\nand video mixed data set, etc.). In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing\na deep multi-task multi-view learning framework that learns a deep\nrepresentation for such dual-heterogeneity problems. Empirical studies on\nmultiple real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nDeep-MTMV algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 03:26:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-28"}

Such services\nrequire an end user to send data to the service provider, which presents a\nserious challenge to end-user privacy. To address this concern, prior works\neither add noise to the data or send features extracted from the raw data. They\nstruggle to balance between the utility and privacy because added noise reduces\nutility and raw data can be reconstructed from extracted features. This work\nrepresents a methodical departure from prior works: we balance between a\nmeasure of privacy and another of utility by leveraging adversarial learning to\nfind a sweeter tradeoff. We design an encoder that optimizes against the\nreconstruction error (a measure of privacy), adversarially by a Decoder, and\nthe inference accuracy (a measure of utility) by a Classifier. The result is\nRAN, a novel deep model with a new training algorithm that automatically\nextracts features for classification that are both private and useful. It turns\nout that adversarially forcing the extracted features to only conveys the\nintended information required by classification leads to an implicit\nregularization leading to better classification accuracy than the original\nmodel which completely ignores privacy. Thus, we achieve better privacy with\nbetter utility, a surprising possibility in machine learning!

In this paper, we aim to study the\nfollowing two research questions: 1) What types of output activation functions\nform a well-behaved adversarial loss? 2) How different combinations of output\nactivation functions and regularization approaches perform empirically against\none another? To answer the first question, we adopt the perspective of\nvariational divergence minimization and consider an adversarial loss\nwell-behaved if it behaves as a divergence-like measure between the data and\nmodel distributions. Using a generalized formulation for adversarial losses, we\nderive the necessary and sufficient conditions of a well-behaved adversarial\nloss.

For the second question, we propose a simple comparative framework for\nadversarial losses using discriminative adversarial networks. The proposed\nframework allows us to efficiently evaluate adversarial losses using a standard\nevaluation metric such as the classification accuracy. With the proposed\nframework, we evaluate a comprehensive set of 168 combinations of twelve output\nactivation functions and fourteen regularization approaches on the handwritten\ndigit classification problem to decouple their effects. Our empirical findings\nsuggest that there is no single winning combination of output activation\nfunctions and regularization approaches across all settings.

Decentralized control offers better\nscalability and robustness but requires mechanisms to coordinate on joint tasks\nand to avoid conflicts. Common approaches to learn decentralized policies for\ncooperative MAS suffer from non-stationarity and lacking credit assignment,\nwhich can lead to unstable and uncoordinated behavior in complex environments.\nIn this paper, we propose Strong Emergent Policy approximation (STEP), a\nscalable approach to learn strong decentralized policies for cooperative MAS\nwith a distributed variant of policy iteration. For that, we use function\napproximation to learn from action recommendations of a decentralized\nmulti-agent planning algorithm. STEP combines decentralized multi-agent\nplanning with centralized learning, only requiring a generative model for\ndistributed black box optimization. We experimentally evaluate STEP in two\nchallenging and stochastic domains with large state and joint action spaces and\nshow that STEP is able to learn stronger policies than standard multi-agent\nreinforcement learning algorithms, when combining multi-agent open-loop\nplanning with centralized function approximation. The learned policies can be\nreintegrated into the multi-agent planning process to further improve\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 07:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-28"}

However, it incurs a\nlarge pilot overhead when used with conventional channel estimation (CE)\ntechniques. This is because these CE techniques involve digital processing,\nrequiring the up/down-conversion chain to be time-multiplexed across the\nantenna dimensions. This paper introduces a novel CE technique, called\ncontinuous analog channel estimation (CACE), that avoids digital processing,\nenables analog beamforming at the receiver and additionally provides resilience\nagainst oscillator phase-noise. By avoiding time-multiplexing of\nup/down-conversion chains, the CE overhead is reduced significantly and\nfurthermore becomes independent of the number of antenna elements. In CACE, a\nreference tone is transmitted continuously with the data signals, and the\nreceiver uses the received reference signal as a matched filter for combining\nthe data signals, albeit via analog processing. We propose a receiver\narchitecture for CACE, analyze its performance in the presence of oscillator\nphase-noise, and derive near-optimal system parameters and power allocation.\nTransmit beamforming and initial access procedure with CACE are also discussed.\nSimulations confirm that, in comparison to conventional CE, CACE provides\nphase-noise resilience and a significant reduction in the CE overhead, while\nsuffering only a small loss in signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 07:18:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 05:57:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-23"}

The most\nadvanced spectrometers are approaching a precision of $\\sim 10$ cm/s that\nimplies the need to identify and correct for all possible sources of RV\noscillations intrinsic to the star down to this level and possibly beyond. The\nrecent discovery of global-scale equatorial Rossby waves in the Sun, also\ncalled r modes, prompted us to investigate their possible signature in stellar\nRV measurements. R modes are toroidal modes of oscillation whose restoring\nforce is the Coriolis force and propagate in the retrograde direction in a\nframe that corotates with the star. The solar r modes with azimuthal orders $3\n\\leq m \\lesssim 15$ were identified unambiguously because of their dispersion\nrelation and their long e-folding lifetimes of hundreds of days. Here we\nsimulate the RV oscillations produced by sectoral r modes with $2 \\leq m \\leq\n5$ assuming a stellar rotation period of 25.54 days and a maximum amplitude of\nthe surface velocity of each mode of 2 m/s. This amplitude is representative of\nthe solar measurements, except for the $m=2$ mode which has not yet been\nobserved. Sectoral r modes with azimuthal orders $m=2$ and $3$ would produce RV\noscillations with amplitudes of 76.4 and 19.6 cm/s and periods of 19.16 and\n10.22 days, respectively, for a star with an inclination of the rotation axis\n$i=60^{\\circ}$. Therefore, they may produce rather sharp peaks in the Fourier\nspectrum of the radial velocity time series that could lead to spurious\nplanetary detections. Sectoral r~modes may represent a source of confusion in\nthe case of slowly rotating inactive stars that are preferential targets for RV\nplanet search. The main limitation of the present investigation is the lack of\nobservational constraint on the amplitude of the $m=2$ mode on the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 08:16:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

Very thin FeSe epitaxial films with various [Fe]/[Se] were\nfabricated by molecular beam epitaxy and classified into two groups with\nrespect to lattice strain and electrical properties. Lattice parameter a\nincreased and lattice parameter c decreased with increasing [Fe]/[Se] up to 1.1\nand then a levelled off and c began to decrease at higher [Fe]/[Se].\nConsequently, the FeSe films had the most strained lattice when [Fe]/[Se] was\n1.1, but these films had the best quality with respect to crystallinity and\nsurface flatness. All the FeSe films with [Fe]/[Se] of 0.8-1.9 exhibited\ninsulator-like behavior, but the temperature dependences of their electrical\nresistivities exhibited different activation energies Ea between the Se-rich\nand Fe-rich regions; i.e., Ea were small (a few meV) up to [Fe]/[Se]=1.1 but\njumped up to ~25 meV at higher [Fe]/[Se].

For instance, full-duplex\ncommunication suffers from such uncertainties when canceling the\nself-interference, since the residual self-interference (RSI) remains\nuncanceled due to imperfect channel knowledge. We consider a MIMO multi-hop\nsystem, where the source, the relay and the destination are equipped with\nmultiple antennas. We allow multi-stream beamforming granted by MIMO technique,\nwithout restricting the transmissions to single streaming. The relay can\noperate in either half-duplex or full-duplex mode, and it changes the mode\ndepending on the RSI strength. Furthermore, the relay is assumed to perform a\ndecode-and-forward (DF) strategy. We investigate a robust transceiver design\nproblem, which maximizes the throughput rate of the worst-case RSI under RSI\nchannel uncertainty bound constraint. The problem turns out to be a non-convex\noptimization problem. We propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a local\noptimal solution iteratively. Eventually, we obtain insights on the optimal\nantenna allocation at the relay input-frontend and output-frontend, for relay\nreception and transmission, respectively. Interestingly, with less number of\nantennas at the source than that at the destination, more number of antennas\nshould be used at the relay input-frontend than the relay output-frontend.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 08:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-28"}

We benefit from the fact\nthat molecular states dominated by resonant $p$-wave interaction are\nparticularly sensitive to the spin-orbit interaction.

In genetic epidemiology, complex diseases have a polygenic basis\nand a common assumption is that biological and genetic features affect the\noutcome under consideration via interactions. In the case of omics data, the\nuse of standard approaches such as generalized linear models may be suboptimal\nand machine learning methods are appealing to make individual predictions.\nHowever, most of these algorithms focus mostly on main or marginal effects of\nthe single features in a dataset. On the other hand, the detection of\ninteracting features is an active area of research in the realm of genetic\nepidemiology. One big class of algorithms to detect interacting features is\nbased on the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR). Here, we extend the\nmodel-based MDR (MB-MDR), a powerful extension of the original MDR algorithm,\nto enable interaction empowered individual prediction. Using a comprehensive\nsimulation study we show that our new algorithm can use information hidden in\ninteractions more efficiently than two other state-of-the-art algorithms,\nnamely the Random Forest and Elastic Net, and clearly outperforms these if\ninteractions are present. The performance of these algorithms is comparable if\nno interactions are present. Further, we show that our new algorithm is\napplicable to real data by comparing the performance of the three algorithms on\na dataset of rheumatoid arthritis cases and healthy controls. As our new\nalgorithm is not only applicable to biological/genetic data but to all datasets\nwith discrete features, it may have practical implications in other\napplications as well, and we made our method available as an R package.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 10:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-28"}

First, it is difficult to understand what\nexactly they learn. Second, they tend to work poorly on sequences requiring\nlong-term memorization, despite having this capacity in principle. We aim to\naddress both shortcomings with a class of recurrent networks that use a\nstochastic state transition mechanism between cell applications. This\nmechanism, which we term state-regularization, makes RNNs transition between a\nfinite set of learnable states. We evaluate state-regularized RNNs on (1)\nregular languages for the purpose of automata extraction; (2) nonregular\nlanguages such as balanced parentheses, palindromes, and the copy task where\nexternal memory is required; and (3) real-word sequence learning tasks for\nsentiment analysis, visual object recognition, and language modeling. We show\nthat state-regularization (a) simplifies the extraction of finite state\nautomata modeling an RNN's state transition dynamics; (b) forces RNNs to\noperate more like automata with external memory and less like finite state\nmachines; (c) makes RNNs have better interpretability and explainability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 10:28:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 07:54:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

In particular, the impact of finite temperature on the\nlattice constants and bulk modulus, and the role of dispersive interactions in\ncalculating them, is examined by using molecular dynamics based on density\nfunctional theory.

While in many situations of interest the\nagents motion is driven by the transmission of information (e.g. the presence\nof an approaching predator) from neighboring peers, previous modeling efforts\nhave focused on situations where agents either sit on static networks, or move\nindependently of the information spreading across the population. Here, we\nintroduce a reference model to tackle this current lack of general framework.\nWe consider mobile agents which align their direction of motion (based on the\nKuramoto dynamics) and carry an internal state governed by the\nSusceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic process, characterizing the\nspread of information in the population, and affecting the way agents move in\nspace. We show that the feedback between the agents motion and information\nspreading is responsible for (i) the enhancement of both flocking and\ninformation spreading, (ii) the emergence of complex spatial structures, or\nswarms, which can be controlled by the velocity of the agents. The SIS dynamics\nis able to drive a flocking phase transition even in the absence of explicit\nvelocity-alignment, recovering a behavior reminiscent of Vicsek-like systems\nbut featuring macro-phase separation rather than micro-phase separation. We\nshow that the formation of dense swarms at low velocities reduces the epidemic\nthreshold of information spreading with respect to the mean field limit. By\nbridging together soft active matter physics and agent based modeling of\ncomplex systems, we shed light upon a general positive feedback mechanism that\ncrucially affects the collective behavior of mobile agents, providing a\nreference framework to study realistic situations where this mechanism is at\nplay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 11:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-28"}

The most reliable indicators of errors in\nconcurrency are data races, which are accesses to a shared resource that can be\nexecuted consecutively.

The input consists of a concurrent trace $t$,\nand the task is to determine all pairs of events of $t$ that constitute a data\nrace. The problem lies at the heart of concurrent verification and has been\nextensively studied for over three decades. However, existing polynomial-time\nsound techniques are highly incomplete and can miss many simple races.\n  In this work we develop M2: a new polynomial-time algorithm for this problem,\nwhich has no false positives.

A magnetic field free, and three\nmagnetic models that start with an initial, vertical, homogeneous field of 10\nG, 50 G, and 100 G magnetic flux density, are simulated using the CO$^{\\rm\n5}$BOLD code. We find that the IGWs are generated in similar manner in all four\nmodels in spite of the differences in the magnetic environment. The mechanical\nenergy carried by IGWs is significantly larger than that of the acoustic waves\nin the lower part of the atmosphere, making them an important component of the\ntotal wave energy budget. The mechanical energy flux (10$^{6}$ - 10$^{3}$ W\nm$^{-2}$) is few orders of magnitude larger than the Poynting flux (10$^{3}$ -\n10$^{1}$ W m$^{-2}$). The Poynting fluxes show a downward component in the\nfrequency range corresponding to the IGWs, which confirm that these waves do\nnot propagate upwards in the atmosphere when the fields are predominantly\nvertical and strong.

Large-scale bars in single- and double-barred systems show similar\nsizes, and inner bars may be longer than outer bars in different galaxies.

Empirical calibration using Level-I order book\ndata from Eurex future assets (Bund and DAX) show that the Hawkes term\ndramatically improves the pure \"Queue-Reactive\" model not only for the\ndescription of the order flow properties (as e.g. the statistics of inter-event\ntimes) but also with respect to the shape of the queue distributions. The\nsecond variant we introduce describes the joint dynamics of all events\noccurring at best bid and ask sides of some order book during a trading day.\nThis model can be considered as a queue dependent extension of the multivariate\nHawkes order-book model of Bacry et al. We provide an explicit way to calibrate\nthis model either with a Maximum-Likelihood method or with a Least-Square\napproach. Empirical estimation from Bund and DAX level-I order book data allow\nus to recover the main features of Hawkes interactions uncovered in Bacry et\nal. but also to unveil their joint dependence on bid and ask queue sizes. We\nnotably find that while the market order or mid-price changes rates can mainly\nbe functions on the volume imbalance this is not the case for the arrival rate\nof limit or cancel orders. Our findings also allows us to clearly bring to\nlight various features that distinguish small and large tick assets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 15:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-28"}

The de-orbit device would be externally directed\ntowards a dead satellite or placed on one by an external satellite servicing\nsystem. Our solutions are intended to be simple, high-reliability devices that\noperate in a passive manner, requiring no active electronics or utilize\nexternal beamed power in the form of radio frequency, microwave or laser to\noperate. Utilizing this approach, it is possible for an external, even ground\nbased system to direct the de-orbit of a spacecraft. The role of an external\nsystem to direct the de-orbit is important to avoid accidental collisions. Some\nform of propulsion is needed to lower the orbit of the dead satellite or\norbital debris. We considered green (non-toxic) propulsion methods including\nsolar radiation pressure, solar-thermal propulsion using water steam,\nsolar-electrolysis propulsion using water and use of electrodynamic tethers.\nBased on this trade-study we identify multiple solutions that can be used to\nde-orbit a spacecraft or orbital debris.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 14:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

An important new feature of our method is that it is not\nglobal: the maps we consider are only required to be defined and holomorphic on\na neighbourhood of some finite set.\n  We will illustrate this method by obtaining transversality for a wide class\nof one-parameter families of interval and circle maps, for example for maps\nwith flat critical points, but also for maps with complex analytic extensions\nsuch as certain polynomial-like maps. As in Tsujii's approach \\cite{Tsu0,Tsu1},\nfor real maps we obtain {\\em positive} transversality (where $>0$ holds instead\nof just $\\ne 0$), and thus monotonicity of entropy for these families, and also\n(as an easy application) for the real quadratic family.\n  This method additionally gives results for unimodal families of the form\n$x\\mapsto |x|^\\ell+c$ for $\\ell>1$ not necessarily an even integer and $c$\nreal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 15:30:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 16:16:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-10"}

Currently, a\ntheoretically rigorous formulation for latent heat is still not in place; and\nthe existing fitting formulas for various fluids are, in nature,\nsystem-dependent. In this paper, the enthalpy of vaporization and its change\nwith temperature are derived rigorously from first principles at the reference\nand critical states. A composite formula for enthalpy of vaporization is\nconstituted from physical plausibility.
