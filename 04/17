Cells in these\nhybrid E/M phenotypes often combine epithelial and mesenchymal features and\ntend to migrate collectively commonly as small clusters. Such collectively\nmigrating cancer cells play a pivotal role in seeding metastases and their\npresence in cancer patients indicates an adverse prognostic factor. Moreover,\ncancer cells in hybrid E/M phenotypes tend to be more associated with stemness\nwhich endows them with tumor-initiation ability and therapy resistance. Most\nrecently, cells undergoing EMT have been shown to promote immune suppression\nfor better survival. A systematic understanding of the emergence of hybrid E/M\nphenotypes and the connection of EMT with stemness and immune suppression would\ncontribute to more effective therapeutic strategies. In this review, we first\ndiscuss recent efforts combining theoretical and experimental approaches to\nelucidate mechanisms underlying EMT multi-stability (i.e. the existence of\nmultiple stable phenotypes during EMT) and the properties of hybrid E/M\nphenotypes. Following we discuss non-cell-autonomous regulation of EMT by cell\ncooperation and extracellular matrix. Afterwards, we discuss various metrics\nthat can be used to quantify EMT spectrum. We further describe possible\nmechanisms underlying the formation of clusters of circulating tumor cells.\nLast but not least, we summarize recent systems biology analysis of the role of\nEMT in the acquisition of stemness and immune suppression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 16:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

Virtually all commercially available devices are thermoelectric\ngenerators, in which electrons flow through a solid driven by a temperature\ndifference. Thermophotovoltaics and thermionics are highly efficient\nalternatives relying on the direct emission of photons and electrons. However,\nthe low energy flux carried by the emitted particles significantly limits their\ngenerated electrical power density potential. Creating nanoscale vacuum gaps\nbetween the emitter and the receiver in thermionic and thermophotovoltaic\ndevices enables a significant enhancement of the electron and photon energy\nfluxes, respectively, which in turn results in an increase of the generated\nelectrical power density. Here we propose a thermionic-enhanced near-field\nthermophotovoltaic device that exploits the simultaneous emission of photons\nand electrons through nanoscale vacuum gaps.

Photon tunnelling and space charge removal across the\nnanoscale vacuum gap produce a drastic increase in flux of electrons and\nphotons, and subsequently, of the generated electrical power density.

While prior methods for neural network\nbinarization binarize each filter independently, we propose to instead\nparametrize the weight tensor of each layer using matrix or tensor\ndecomposition. The binarization process is then performed using this latent\nparametrization, via a quantization function (e.g. sign function) applied to\nthe reconstructed weights. A key feature of our method is that while the\nreconstruction is binarized, the computation in the latent factorized space is\ndone in the real domain. This has several advantages: (i) the latent\nfactorization enforces a coupling of the filters before binarization, which\nsignificantly improves the accuracy of the trained models.

In this paper, we propose an approach for removing the need for\nmanual engineering of reward specifications by enabling a robot to learn from a\nmodest number of examples of successful outcomes, followed by actively\nsolicited queries, where the robot shows the user a state and asks for a label\nto determine whether that state represents successful completion of the task.\nWhile requesting labels for every single state would amount to asking the user\nto manually provide the reward signal, our method requires labels for only a\ntiny fraction of the states seen during training, making it an efficient and\npractical approach for learning skills without manually engineered rewards. We\nevaluate our method on real-world robotic manipulation tasks where the\nobservations consist of images viewed by the robot's camera.

The analog false\nvacuum manifests as a metastable vacuum state for the relative phase in a\ntwo-species Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), induced by a driven periodic\ncoupling between the two species. In the appropriate low energy limit, the\nevolution of the relative phase is approximately governed by a relativistic\nwave equation exhibiting true and false vacuum configurations. In previous\nwork, a linear stability analysis identified exponentially growing\nshort-wavelength modes driven by the time-dependent coupling. These modes\nthreaten to destabilize the analog false vacuum. Here, we employ numerical\nsimulations of the coupled Gross-Pitaevski equations (GPEs) to determine the\nnon-linear evolution of these linearly unstable modes.

We briefly discuss various physically expected\ncorrections to the GPEs that may act to remove the exponentially unstable\nmodes. To investigate the resulting dynamics in cases where such a removal\nmechanism exists, we implement a hard UV cutoff that excludes the unstable\nmodes as a simple model for these corrections.

In contrast to existing superlattice\nplatforms, these flat bands are realized without the need for fine tuning.\nInstead, the bands become flat as the gate voltage increases in magnitude. The\ncharacteristics of PDS flatbands are highly tunable: the type of flatband\n(single non-degenerate or dirac-cone-like), localization length, and\ninteraction energy are sensitive to the applied gate voltage. As a result,\nelectron-electron interactions in the PDS flatbands can become stronger than\nboth the bandwidth and disorder broadening, providing a setting for correlated\nbehavior such as flatband ferromagnetism. We expect PDS flatbands can be\nexperimentally realized in a range of readily available gapped vdW materials\nsuch as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, e.g. WSe2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

The\nphysical mechanism of this phenomenon is still unclarified, and the energy\ndeposition into the envelope has been proposed as a possible cause of the\nconfined CSM. In this work, we have calculated the response of the envelope to\nvarious types of sustained energy deposition starting from a few years before\nthe core collapse. We have further investigated how the resulting progenitor\nstructure would affect appearance of the ensuing supernova.\n  While it has been suspected that a super-Eddington energy deposition may lead\nto a strong and/or eruptive mass loss to account for the confined CSM, we have\nfound that a highly super-Eddington energy injection into the envelope changes\nthe structure of the progenitor star substantially, and the properties of the\nresulting SNe become inconsistent with usual SNe. This argument constrains the\nenergy budget involved in the possible stellar activity in the final years to\nbe at most one order of magnitude higher than the Eddington luminosity. Such an\nenergy generation however would not dynamically develop a strong wind in the\ntime scale of a few years. We therefore propose that a secondary effect (e.g.,\npulsation or binary interaction) triggered by the moderate envelope inflation,\nwhich is caused by sub-Eddington energy injection, likely induces the mass\nloss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

A standard practice to account for multiple simultaneous structures in\nconvex optimization is to add further regularizers or constraints.

Accurate model predictions including the physics of baryons are\nrequired to make the most of the upcoming large cosmological surveys devoted to\ngravitational lensing.

Lensing\nquantities (deflection, shear, convergence) and their statistics (convergence\npower spectrum, shear correlation functions, galaxy-galaxy lensing) are\ncomputed in the past lightcone built in the Horizon-AGN hydrodynamical\ncosmological simulation, which implements our best knowledge on baryonic\nphysics at the galaxy scale in order to mimic galaxy populations over cosmic\ntime. Methods. Lensing quantities are generated over a one square degree field\nof view by performing multiple-lens plane ray-tracing through the lightcone,\ntaking full advantage of the 1 kpc resolution and splitting the line of sight\nover 500 planes all the way to redshift z~7. Two methods are explored (standard\nprojection of particles with adaptive smoothing, and integration of the\nacceleration field) to assert a good implementation. The focus is on small\nscales where baryons matter most. Results. Standard cosmic shear statistics are\nimpacted at the 10% level by the baryonic component for angular scales below a\nfew arcmin.

Gaia DR2 has provided\nparallaxes for a billion stars, which are offset by a parallax zero-point. Red\nClump (RC) stars have a narrow spread in luminosity, thus functioning as\nstandard candles to calibrate these systematics. This work measures how the\nmagnitude and spread of the RC in the Kepler field are affected by changes to\ntemperature and scaling relations for seismology, and changes to the parallax\nzero-point for Gaia. We use a sample of 5576 RC stars classified through\nasteroseismology. We apply hierarchical Bayesian latent variable models,\nfinding the population level properties of the RC with seismology, and use\nthose as priors on Gaia parallaxes to find the parallax zero-point offset. We\nthen find the position of the RC using published values for the zero-point. We\nfind a seismic temperature insensitive spread of the RC of ~0.03 mag in the\n2MASS K band and a larger and slightly temperature-dependent spread of ~0.13\nmag in the Gaia G band.

Within quantum thermodynamics such limitations can be derived from\nfirst principles. In particular, it can be shown that establishing correlations\nbetween initially uncorrelated systems in a thermal background has an energetic\ncost. This cost, which depends on the system dimension and the details of the\nenergy-level structure, can be bounded from below but whether these bounds are\nachievable is an open question. Here, we put forward a framework for studying\nthe process of optimally correlating identical (thermal) quantum systems. The\nframework is based on decompositions into subspaces that each support only\nstates with diagonal (classical) marginals. Using methods from stochastic\nmajorisation theory, we show that the creation of correlations at minimal\nenergy cost is possible for all pairs of three- and four-dimensional quantum\nsystems. For higher dimensions we provide sufficient conditions for the\nexistence of such optimally correlating operations, which we conjecture to\nexist in all dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 19:38:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 18:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}

It demonstrated the existence of neutron stars, gave a powerful\nobservational tool to study them, and has allowed us to probe strong gravity,\ndense matter, and the interstellar medium. More recently, pulsar surveys have\nled to the serendipitous discovery of fast radio bursts (FRBs). While FRBs\nappear similar to the individual pulses from pulsars, their large dispersive\ndelays suggest that they originate from far outside the Milky Way and hence are\nmany orders-of-magnitude more luminous. While most FRBs appear to be one-off,\nperhaps cataclysmic events, two sources are now known to repeat and thus\nclearly have a longer-lived central engine. Beyond understanding how they are\ncreated, there is also the prospect of using FRBs -- as with pulsars -- to\nprobe the extremes of the Universe as well as the otherwise invisible\nintervening medium. Such studies will be aided by the high implied all-sky\nevent rate: there is a detectable FRB roughly once every minute occurring\nsomewhere on the sky. The fact that less than a hundred FRB sources have been\ndiscovered in the last decade is largely due to the small fields-of-view of\ncurrent radio telescopes. A new generation of wide-field instruments is now\ncoming online, however, and these will be capable of detecting multiple FRBs\nper day. We are thus on the brink of further breakthroughs in the\nshort-duration radio transient phase space, which will be critical for\ndifferentiating between the many proposed theories for the origin of FRBs. In\nthis review, we give an observational and theoretical introduction at a level\nthat is accessible to astronomers entering the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 19:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

For a vibrational bath that equilibrates faster than R-ISC (in\nemitters with weak singlet-triplet mixing), our results reveal that significant\nimprovements in efficiencies with respect to the cavity-free counterpart can be\nobtained for strong coupling of the singlet exciton to a photonic mode, as long\nas the singlet to triplet exciton transition is within the inverted Marcus\nregime; under these circumstances, we show the possibility to overcome the\ndetrimental delocalization of the polariton states across a macroscopic number\nof molecules.

To solve this problem,\nthe visual system uses selective attention, which allocates resources to a\nspecific spatial location, to attend to one of the stimuli in the receptive\nfield. During this process, the center and width of the attending receptive\nfield change. The model presented in the paper, which is extended and altered\nfrom Bobier et al., simulates the selective attention between the primary\nvisual cortex, V1, and middle temporal (MT) area. The responses of the MT\ncolumns, which encode the target stimulus, are compared to the results of an\nexperiment conducted by Womelsdorf et al. on the receptive field shift and\nshrinkage in macaque MT area from selective attention. Based on the results,\nthe responses in the MT area are similar to the Gaussian shaped receptive\nfields found in the experiment. As well, the responses of the MT columns are\nalso measured for accuracy of representing the target visual stimulus and is\nfound to represent the stimulus with a root mean squared error around 0.17 to\n0.18. The paper also explores varying model parameters, such as the membrane\ntime constant and maximum firing rates, and how those affect the measurement.\nThis model is a start to modeling the responses of selective attention, however\nthere are still improvements that can be made to better compare with the\nexperiment, produce more accurate responses and incorporate more biologically\nplausible features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 20:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-18"}

While the influence of $R$ on the lattice dynamics\nof skutterudite materials has been well studied, the phase stability of\n$R$-filled skutterudite materials and the influence of the presence and\nordering of $R$ on the electronic structure remain unclear. Here, focusing on\nthe Yb-filled skutterudite Yb$_x$Co$_4$Sb$_{12}$, we employ first-principles\nmethods to compute the phase stability and electronic structure. Yb-filled\nCoSb$_3$ exhibits (1) a mild tendency for phase separation into Yb-rich and\nYb-poor regions and (2) a strong tendency for chemical decomposition into\nCo--Sb and Yb--Sb binaries (i.e., CoSb$_3$, CoSb$_2$, and YbSb$_2$). We find\nthat, at reasonable synthesis temperatures, configurational entropy stabilizes\nsingle-phase solid solutions with limited Yb solubility, in agreement with\nexperiments. Filling CoSb$_3$ with Yb increases the band gap, enhances the\ncarrier effective masses, and generates new low-energy ``emergent'' conduction\nband minima, which is distinct from the traditional band convergence picture of\naligning the energies of existing band extrema. The explicit presence of $R$ is\nnecessary to achieve the emergent conduction band minima, though the rattler\nordering does not strongly influence the electronic structure.

Due to maturation of combinatorial methods and their\nsuccessful application in many fields, the modern combinatorial laboratory\nproduces diverse and complex data sets requiring advanced analysis and\nvisualization techniques. In order to utilize these large data sets to uncover\nnew knowledge, the combinatorial scientist must engage in data science. For\ndata science tasks, most laboratories adopt common-purpose data management and\nvisualization software. However, processing and cross-correlating data from\nvarious measurement tools is no small task for such generic programs. Here we\ndescribe COMBIgor, a purpose-built open-source software package written in the\ncommercial Igor Pro environment, designed to offer a systematic approach to\nloading, storing, processing, and visualizing combinatorial data sets. It\nincludes (1) methods for loading and storing data sets from combinatorial\nlibraries, (2) routines for streamlined data processing, and (3) data analysis\nand visualization features to construct figures. Most importantly, COMBIgor is\ndesigned to be easily customized by a laboratory, group, or individual in order\nto integrate additional instruments and data-processing algorithms.

In the 8 nm/8 nm superlattice, the\ncoupling strength increases nonlinearly at high pump fluences, which may\neventually reach an extreme state where all three phonon modes share the same\ncoherent state, as predicted by Orbach in the 1960s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 22:48:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 17:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-25"}

In this paper, we address both issues inspired by observing that\nthese targets are often clustered. In particular, we propose a Clustered\nDetection (ClusDet) network that unifies object clustering and detection in an\nend-to-end framework. The key components in ClusDet include a cluster proposal\nsub-network (CPNet), a scale estimation sub-network (ScaleNet), and a dedicated\ndetection network (DetecNet). Given an input image, CPNet produces object\ncluster regions and ScaleNet estimates object scales for these regions. Then,\neach scale-normalized cluster region is fed into DetecNet for object detection.\nClusDet has several advantages over previous solutions: (1) it greatly reduces\nthe number of chips for final object detection and hence achieves high running\ntime efficiency, (2) the cluster-based scale estimation is more accurate than\npreviously used single-object based ones, hence effectively improves the\ndetection for small objects, and (3) the final DetecNet is dedicated for\nclustered regions and implicitly models the prior context information so as to\nboost detection accuracy.

This can be then compared to the distribution expected from\ngeneral relativity, i.e. no deviation in any of the events. We demonstrate that\nour method is robust to measurement uncertainties and can be applied to\ntheories of gravity where the parameters beyond general relativity are related\nto each other, as generally expected. Our method contains the two extremes of\ncommon and unrelated parameters as limiting cases. We apply the hierarchical\nmodel to the population of 10 binary black hole systems so far detected by LIGO\nand Virgo. We do this for a parametrized test of gravitational wave generation,\nby modeling the population distribution of beyond-general-relativity parameters\nwith a Gaussian distribution. We compute the mean and the variance of the\npopulation and show that both are consistent with general relativity for all\nparameters we consider. In the best case, we find that the population\nproperties of the existing binary signals are consistent with general\nrelativity at the ~1% level.

This work\npresents a systematic framework for computing geometric properties of these\nbackground structures in the embedding field description. An overview of the\nlocal geometric quantities associated with a foliation is given, including a\nreview of the Gauss, Codazzi, and Ricci-Voss equations, which relate the\ngeometry of the foliation to the ambient curvature. Generalizations of these\nequations for curvature in the nonintegrable normal directions are derived.\nParticular care is given to the question of which objects are well-defined for\nsingle submanifolds, and which depend on the structure of the foliation away\nfrom a submanifold.

Thus, the most critical\nability is to model and represent user interests for either stage. Most of the\nexisting deep learning-based models represent one user as a single vector which\nis insufficient to capture the varying nature of user's interests.

By using the oscillator representation, we give a formula for this variance\nsum in terms of a smooth sum over the square of a functional evaluated on the\n$B$-th Fourier coefficients of the vector valued holomorphic Siegel modular\nforms which are Hecke eigenforms and obtained by the theta transfer from\n$O_{A_{m\\times m}}$. By using the Ramanujan bound on the Fourier coefficients\nof the holomorphic cusp forms, we give a sharp upper bound on this variance\nwhen $n=1$. As applications, we prove a cutoff phenomenon for the probability\nthat a unimodular lattice of dimension $m$ represents a given even number. This\ngives an optimal upper bound on the sphere packing density of almost all even\nunimodular lattices.

The common strategy is to apply\nelement-wise constraints between manually labeled pair-wise items to guide the\ngenerators to learn the semantic relationships between the modalities, so that\nthe similar items can be projected close to each other in the common\nrepresentation subspace. However, such constraints often fail to preserve the\nsemantic structure between unpaired but semantically similar items (e.g. the\nunpaired items with the same class label are more similar than items with\ndifferent labels). To address the above problem, we propose a novel cross-modal\nsimilarity transferring (CMST) method to learn and preserve the semantic\nrelationships between unpaired items in an unsupervised way. The key idea is to\nlearn the quantitative similarities in single-modal representation subspace,\nand then transfer them to the common representation subspace to establish the\nsemantic relationships between unpaired items across modalities. Experiments\nshow that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches both in the\nclass-based and pair-based retrieval tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 01:19:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-18"}

This calls for a\nreconsideration of the modeling of the subsequent phase, the supernova remnant\n(SNR), which has commonly relied on simplified ejecta models. In this paper we\nbridge SN and SNR studies by using the output of a SN simulation as the input\nof a SNR simulation carried on until 500~yr. We consider the case of a\nthermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf star as a model for a\nType Ia SN; specifically we use the N100 delayed detonation model of Seitenzahl\net al 2013. In order to analyze the morphology of the SNR, we locate the three\ndiscontinuities that delineate the shell of shocked matter: the forward shock,\nthe contact discontinuity, and the reverse shock, and we decompose their radial\nvariations as a function of angular scale and time. Assuming a uniform ambient\nmedium, we find that the impact of the SN on the SNR may still be visible after\nhundreds of years. Previous 3D simulations aiming at reproducing Tycho's SNR,\nthat started out from spherically symmetric initial conditions, failed to\nreproduce structures at the largest angular scales observed in X-rays. Our new\nsimulations strongly suggest that the missing ingredient was the initial\nasymmetries from the SN itself. With this work we establish a way of assessing\nthe viability of SN models based on the resulting morphology of the SNR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 03:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

The need of such a notion arises\nwhen, for example, statically estimating the range of effects caused by a\nprogram, or studying the ways in which effects with local scopes are derived\nfrom effects with only the global scope. Extending the classical observation\nthat computational effects can be modeled by monads, these computational\neffects with parameters are modeled by various mathematical structures\nincluding graded monads and indexed monads, which are two different\ngeneralizations of ordinary monads. The former has been employed in the\nsemantics of effect systems, whereas the latter in the study of the\nrelationship between the local state monads and the global state monads, each\nexemplifying the two situations mentioned above. However, despite their\nimportance, the mathematical theory of graded and indexed monads is far less\ndeveloped than that of ordinary monads.\n  Here we develop the mathematical theory of graded and indexed monads from a\n2-categorical viewpoint. We first introduce four 2-categories and observe that\nin two of them graded monads are in fact monads in the 2-categorical sense, and\nsimilarly indexed monads are monads in the 2-categorical sense in the other\ntwo.

The corresponding\nresults for graded and indexed comonads also follow.\n  We expect that the current work will provide a theoretical foundation to a\nunified study of computational effects with parameters, or dually (using the\ncomonad variants), of computational resources with parameters, arising for\nexample in Bounded Linear Logic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 05:11:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-18"}

Although exclusive lockings ensure the correctness\nof DBMS, it incurs serious performance penalties on multi-core environments. In\nparticular, existing protocols generally suffer from emerging highly write\ncontended workloads, since they use innumerable lockings for write operations.\nIn this paper, we rethink the Thomas write rule (TWR), which allows the\ntimestamp ordering (T/O) protocol to omit write operations without any\nlockings. We formalize the notion of omitting and decouple it from the T/O\nprotocol implementation, in order to define a new rule named non-visible write\nrule (NWR).

To deal with challenging cases where objects are occluded or\nmissing, previous work relies on greedy data association strategies that make\ndecisions for each frame individually. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach to defer the decision making for a target object in each frame, until\na global view can be established with the entire video being taken into\nconsideration. Our approach is in the same spirit as Multiple Hypotheses\nTracking (MHT) methods, making several critical adaptations for the VOS\nproblem. We employ the bounding box (bbox) hypothesis for tracking tree\nformation, and the multiple hypotheses are spawned by propagating the preceding\nbbox into the detected bbox proposals within a gated region starting from the\ninitial object mask in the first frame. The gated region is determined by a\ngating scheme which takes into account a more comprehensive motion model rather\nthan the simple Kalman filtering model in traditional MHT. To further design\nmore customized algorithms tailored for VOS, we develop a novel mask\npropagation score instead of the appearance similarity score that could be\nbrittle due to large deformations. The mask propagation score, together with\nthe motion score, determines the affinity between the hypotheses during tree\npruning. Finally, a novel mask merging strategy is employed to handle mask\nconflicts between objects. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially in the case of\nobject missing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 08:52:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-18"}

Choosing a proper network architecture is a critical\ndecision for a network's success, usually done in a manual manner. As a\nstraightforward strategy, large, mostly fully connected architectures are\nselected, thereby relying on a good optimization strategy to find proper\nweights while at the same time avoiding overfitting. However, large parts of\nthe final network are redundant. In the best case, large parts of the network\nbecome simply irrelevant for later inferencing. In the worst case, highly\nparameterized architectures hinder proper optimization and allow the easy\ncreation of adverserial examples fooling the network. A first step in removing\nirrelevant architectural parts lies in identifying those parts, which requires\nmeasuring the contribution of individual components such as neurons. In\nprevious work, heuristics based on using the weight distribution of a neuron as\ncontribution measure have shown some success, but do not provide a proper\ntheoretical understanding. Therefore, in our work we investigate game theoretic\nmeasures, namely the Shapley value (SV), in order to separate relevant from\nirrelevant parts of an artificial neural network. We begin by designing a\ncoalitional game for an artificial neural network, where neurons form\ncoalitions and the average contributions of neurons to coalitions yield to the\nShapley value. In order to measure how well the Shapley value measures the\ncontribution of individual neurons, we remove low-contributing neurons and\nmeasure its impact on the network performance.

Recently, atrous convolution with\ndifferent dilation rates has been used to generate features of multi-scales\nthrough several branches which are then fused for prediction. However, there is\na lack of explicit interaction among the branches of different scales to\nadaptively make full use of the contexts. In this paper, we propose a\nContent-Adaptive Scale Interaction Network (CASINet) to exploit the multi-scale\nfeatures for scene parsing. We build CASINet based on the classic Atrous\nSpatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module, followed by a proposed contextual scale\ninteraction (CSI) module, and a scale adaptation (SA) module. Specifically, in\nthe CSI module, for each spatial position of some scale, instead of being\nlimited by a fixed set of convolutional filters that are shared across\ndifferent spatial positions for feature learning, we promote the adaptivity of\nthe convolutional filters to spatial positions. We achieve this by the context\ninteraction among the features of different scales. The SA module explicitly\nand softly selects the suitable scale for each spatial position and each\nchannel. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmodules. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on three scene parsing\nbenchmarks Cityscapes, ADE20K and LIP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 10:33:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 05:14:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 08:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-12"}

This problem is a well studied\nproblem, known as the {\\em densest subgraph problem}, and is solvable in\npolynomial time. But what happens when the edge weights are negative? Is the\nproblem still solvable in polynomial time? Also, why should we care about the\ndensest subgraph problem in the presence of negative weights?\n  In this work we answer the aforementioned question.

We define the metrics\nbased on a previously unexplored characterization of grid inadequacy, that is,\nthe size of the DC power flow infeasible set relative to the size of the power\ninjection set is indicative of inherent grid inadequacy to accommodate power\ninjection diversity without intervention.

We find that the\nproperties of the PEL sampled by the system during the LDA-HDA transformation\nexhibit anomalous behavior. In particular, at conditions where the change in\ndensity during the LDA-HDA transformation is approximately discontinuous,\nreminiscent of a first-order phase transition, we find that (i) the inherent\nstructure (IS) energy, $e_\\text{IS}(V)$, is a concave function of the volume,\nand (ii) the IS pressure, $P_\\text{IS}(V)$, exhibits a van der Waals-like loop.\nIn addition, the curvature of the PEL at the IS is anomalous, a non-monotonic\nfunction of $V$. In agreement with previous studies, our work suggests that\nconditions (i) and (ii) are necessary (but not sufficient) signatures of the\nPEL for the LDA-HDA transformation to be reminiscent of a first-order phase\ntransition. We also find that one can identify two different regions of the\nPEL, one associated to LDA and another to HDA.

We analysed in-situ measurements\nprovided by the two Helios spacecrafts to study the behaviour of the last, the\nstrahl electron population, in the inner Solar system between 0.3 and 1 au. The\nstrahl is characterised with a pitch-angle width (PAW) depending on electron\nenergy and evolving with radial distance. We find different behaviour of the\nstrahl electrons for solar wind separated into types by the core electron beta\nparallel value ($\\beta_{ec\\parallel}$). For the low-$\\beta_{ec\\parallel}$ solar\nwind the strahl component is more pronounced, and the variation of PAW is\nelectron energy dependent. At low energies a slight focusing over distance is\nobserved, and the strahl PAW measured at 0.34 au agrees with the width\npredicted by a collisionless focusing model. The broadening observed for\nhigher-energy strahl electrons during expansion can be described by an\nexponential relation, which points toward an energy dependent scattering\nmechanism. In the high-$\\beta_{ec\\parallel}$ solar wind the strahl appears\nbroader in consistence with the high-$\\beta_{ec\\parallel}$ plasma being more\nunstable with respect to kinetic instabilities.

The UAV positioning and the transmission powers of all nodes\nare jointly designed to maximize the sum rate of both uplink and downlink\nsubject to transmission power constraints and the signal-to-noise ratio\nconstraint on the UAV control channel. The formulated joint positioning and\npower control (JPPC) problem has an intricate expression of the sum rate due to\ntwo-way transmissions and is difficult to solve in general.

The largest source of\nuncertainty in these model-to-data extractions is the choice of theoretical\ninitial conditions (ICs) used to model the distribution of energy or entropy at\nthe hydrodynamic starting time.\n  Descriptions of the ICs are generally improved through iterative cycles of\ntesting and refinement. Individual models are compared to experimental data;\nthe worst models are discarded and best models retained. Consequently,\nsuccessful traits (assumptions) are passed on to subsequent generations of the\ntheoretical landscape. This bottom-up approach correspondingly describes a form\nof theoretical trial and error, where each trial proposes an ab initio solution\nto the problem at hand.\n  A natural complement to this strategy, is to employ a top-down or data-driven\napproach which is able to reverse engineer properties of the ICs from the\nconstraints imposed by the experimental data. In this dissertation, I motivate\nand develop a parametric IC model based on a family of functions known as the\ngeneralized means.

One is the\nentanglement of a quantum state, characterizing the state structure. The other\nis entanglement production by quantum operators, describing the action of\noperators in the given Hilbert space. Entanglement production by statistical\noperators, or density operators, is an important notion arising in quantum\nmeasurements and quantum information processing. The operational meaning of the\nentangling power of any operator, including statistical operators, is the\nproperty of the operators to entangle wave functions of the Hilbert space they\nare defined on. The measure of entanglement production by statistical operators\nis described and illustrated by entangled quantum states, equilibrium Gibbs\nstates, as well as by the state of a complex multiparticle spinor system. It is\nshown that this measure is in intimate relation to other notions of quantum\ninformation theory, such as the purity of quantum states, linear entropy, or\nimpurity, inverse participation ratio, quadratic R\\'{e}nyi entropy, the\ncorrelation function of composite measurements, and decoherence phenomenon.\nThis measure can be introduced for a set of statistical operators\ncharacterizing a system after quantum measurements. The explicit value of the\nmeasure depends on the type of the Hilbert space partitioning. For a general\nmultiparticle spinor system, it is possible to accomplish the particle-particle\npartitioning or spin-spatial partitioning. Conditions are defined showing when\nentanglement production is maximal and when it is zero. The study on\nentanglement production by statistical operators is important because,\ndepending on whether such an operator is entangling or not, it generates\nqualitatively different probability measures, which is principal for quantum\nmeasurements and quantum information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 14:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

In this paper, we aim to study the evolution of stellar rotation and of\nX-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) radiation in tight binary systems consisting of two\nsolar mass stars and use our results to study planetary atmosphere evolution in\nthe habitable zones of these systems.\n  Methods. We have applied a rotation model developed for single stars to\nbinary systems, taking into account the effects of tidal interactions on the\nrotational and orbital evolution of both stars. We used empirical\nrotation-activity relations to predict XUV evolution tracks for the stars,\nwhich we used to model hydrodynamic escape of hydrogen dominated atmospheres.\n  Results. When significant, tidal interactions increase the total amount of\nXUV energy emitted, and in the most extreme cases by up to factor of $\\sim$50.\nWe find that in the systems that we study, habitable zone planets with masses\nof 1~M$_\\oplus$ can lose huge hydrogen atmospheres due to the extended high\nlevels of XUV emission, and the time that is needed to lose these atmospheres\ndepends on the binary orbital separation.For some orbital separations, and when\nthe stars are born as rapid rotators, it is also possible for tidal\ninteractions to protect atmospheres from erosion by quickly spinning down the\nstars. For very small orbital separations, the loss of orbital angular momentum\nby stellar winds causes the two stars to merge. We suggest that the merging of\nthe two stars could cause previously frozen planets to become habitable due to\nthe habitable zone boundaries moving outwards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 14:47:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

We aim to determine the radius of hot Earth-like planets with\nlarge outgassed atmospheres and explore differences between molten and solid\nsilicate planets and their influence on the mass-radius relationship and\ntransmission and emission spectra. An interior-atmosphere model, combined with\nstatic structure calculations, tracks the evolving radius of a rocky mantle\nthat is outgassing CO$_2$ and H$_2$O. Synthetic emission and transmission\nspectra are generated for CO$_2$ and H$_2$O dominated atmospheres. Atmospheres\ndominated by CO$_2$ suppress the outgassing of H$_2$O to a greater extent than\npreviously realised, as previous studies have applied an erroneous relationship\nbetween volatile mass and partial pressure. We therefore predict more H$_2$O\ncan be retained by the interior during the later stages of magma ocean\ncrystallisation. Furthermore, formation of a lid at the surface can tie\noutgassing of H$_2$O to the efficiency of heat transport through the lid,\nrather than the atmosphere's radiative timescale. Contraction of the mantle as\nit solidifies gives $\\sim5\\%$ radius decrease, which can partly be offset by\naddition of a relatively light species to the atmosphere.

To optimally solve this highly non-convex\nproblem, we transform the original speed-constrained trajectory optimization\nproblem into a speed-free problem that is optimally solvable via the Lagrange\ndual decomposition. It is rigorously proved that the optimal 1D trajectory\nsolution follows the successive hover-and-fly (SHF) structure. Next, we\nconsider two orthogonal multiple access (OMA) transmission schemes, i.e.,\nfrequency-division multiple access (FDMA) and time-division multiple access\n(TDMA). We maximize the achievable rate regions in the two cases by jointly\noptimizing the 1D trajectory design and wireless resource (frequency/time)\nallocation. It is shown that the optimal trajectory solutions still follow the\nSHF structure but with different hovering locations. Finally, numerical results\nshow that the proposed optimal trajectory designs achieve considerable rate\ngains over other benchmark schemes, and the capacity region achieved by NOMA\nsignificantly outperforms the rate regions by FDMA and TDMA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 15:03:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 06:44:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 16:14:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 4 Oct 2019 17:10:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-17"}

Particularly, we explore two critical\nresearch problems existed in VQA: (1) efficiently fusing the visual and textual\nmodalities; (2) enabling the visual reasoning ability of VQA models in\nanswering complex questions. To address these challenging problems, a novel\nQuestion Guided Modular Routing Networks (QGMRN) has been proposed in this\npaper. Particularly, The QGMRN is composed of visual, textual and routing\nnetwork. The visual and textual network serve as the backbones for the generic\nfeature extractors of visual and textual modalities. QGMRN can fuse the visual\nand textual modalities at multiple semantic levels. Typically, the visual\nreasoning is facilitated by the routing network in a discrete and stochastic\nway by using Gumbel-Softmax trick for module selection. When the input reaches\na certain modular layer, routing network newly proposed in this paper,\ndynamically selects a portion of modules from that layer to process the input\ndepending on the question features generated by the textual network. It can\nalso learn to reason by routing between the generic modules without additional\nsupervision information or expert knowledge. Benefiting from the dynamic\nrouting mechanism, QGMRN can outperform the previous classical VQA methods by a\nlarge margin and achieve the competitive results against the state-of-the-art\nmethods. Furthermore, attention mechanism is integrated into our QGMRN model\nand thus can further boost the model performance.

Likewise,\ncollective behavior is often observed to emerge spontaneously from the mutual\ninteractions between constituent motile units in biological systems. Examples\nwhere these phenomena can be observed simultaneously have been identified in\nrecent experiments on bird flocks, fish schools and bacterial swarms. These\nresults pose an intriguing question, which cannot be resolved by existing\ntheories of active matter: How is the collective motion of these systems\naffected by the anomalous diffusion of the constituent units? Here, we answer\nthis question for a microscopic model of active L\\'evy matter -- a collection\nof active particles that perform superdiffusion akin to a L\\'evy flight and\ninteract by promoting polar alignment of their orientations. We present in\ndetails the derivation of the hydrodynamic equations of motion of the model,\nobtain from these equations the criteria for a disordered or ordered state, and\napply linear stability analysis on these states at the onset of collective\nmotion. Our analysis reveals that the disorder-order phase transition in active\nL\\'evy matter is critical, in contrast to ordinary active fluids where the\nphase transition is, instead, first-order. Correspondingly, we estimate the\ncritical exponents of the transition by finite size scaling analysis and use\nthese numerical estimates to relate our findings to known universality classes.\nThese results highlight the novel physics exhibited by active matter\nintegrating both anomalous diffusive single-particle motility and\ninter-particle interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 15:46:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 09:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

Coupling could range from weak and\nlocal, i.e. decentralized, to strong and global, i.e. centralized. We developed\na model-free measure of centralization that compares information shared between\ncontrol signals and both global and local states. A second measure, called\nco-information, quantifies the net redundant information the control signal\nshares with both states. We first validate our measures through simulations of\ncoupled oscillators and show that it successfully reconstructs the shift from\nlow to high coupling strengths. We then measure centralization in freely\nrunning cockroaches. Surprisingly, extensor muscle activity in the middle leg\nis more informative of movements of all legs combined than the movements of\nthat particular leg. Cockroach centralization successfully recapitulates a\nspecific model of a strongly coupled oscillator network previously used to\nmodel cockroach leg kinematics. When segregated by stride frequency, slower\ncockroach strides exhibit more shared information per stride between control\nand output states than faster strides, indicative of an information bandwidth\nlimitation. However, centralization remains consistent between the two groups.\nWe then used a robotic model to show that centralization can be affected by\nmechanical coupling independent of neural coupling. The mechanically coupled\nbounding gait is decentralized and becomes more decentralized as mechanical\ncoupling decreases while internal parameters of control remain constant. The\nresults of these systems span a design space of centralization and\nco-information that can be used to test biological hypotheses and advise the\ndesign of robotic control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 15:05:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

The IoMT devices\nare continuously pushing their readings to the remote cloud servers for\nreal-time data analytics, that causes faster drainage of the device battery.\nMoreover, other demerits of continuous centralizing of data include exposed\nprivacy and high latency. This paper presents a novel Federated Filtering\nFramework for IoMT devices which is based on the prediction of data at the\ncentral fog server using shared models provided by the local IoMT devices. The\nfog server performs model averaging to predict the aggregated data matrix and\nalso computes filter parameters for local IoMT devices. Two significant\ntheoretical contributions of this paper are the global tolerable perturbation\nerror (${To{l_F}}$) and the local filtering parameter ($\\delta$); where the\nformer controls the decision-making accuracy due to eigenvalue perturbation and\nthe later balances the tradeoff between the communication overhead and\nperturbation error of the aggregated data matrix (predicted matrix) at the fog\nserver. Experimental evaluation based on real healthcare data demonstrates that\nthe proposed scheme saves upto 95\\% of the communication cost while maintaining\nreasonable data privacy and low latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 02:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

The PGET\ninstrument is essentially a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)\nsystem that allows the reconstruction of axial cross-sections of the emission\nmap of the SFA. The fuel material heavily self-attenuates its gamma-ray\nemissions, so that correctly accounting for the attenuation is a critical\nfactor in producing accurate images. Due to the nature of the inspections, it\nis desirable to use as little a priori information as possible about the fuel,\nincluding the attenuation map, in the reconstruction process. Current\nreconstruction methods either do not correct for attenuation, assume a uniform\nattenuation throughout the fuel assembly, or assume an attenuation map based on\nan initial filtered back projection (FBP) reconstruction. Here, we propose a\nmethod to simultaneously reconstruct the emission and attenuation maps by\nformulating the reconstruction as a constrained minimization problem with a\nleast squares data fidelity term and regularization terms. Using simulated\ndata, we compare the proposed method to FBP, showing that our approach produces\nsignificantly better reconstructions by various numerical metrics and a much\nbetter classification of spent, missing, and fresh fuel rods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 07:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-13"}
