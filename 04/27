One particularly promising class of methods, random\nsketching solvers, has achieved the best known computational complexity bounds\nin theory, but is blunted by two practical considerations: there is no clear\nway of choosing the size of the sketching matrix apriori; and there is a\nnontrivial storage cost of the sketched system. In this work, we make progress\ntowards addressing these issues by implicitly generating the sketched system\nand solving it simultaneously through an iterative procedure. As a result, we\nreplace the question of the size of the sketching matrix with determining\nappropriate stopping criteria; we also avoid the costs of explicitly\nrepresenting the sketched linear system; and our implicit representation also\nsolves the system at the same time, which controls the per-iteration\ncomputational costs.\n  Additionally, our approach allows us to generate a connection between random\nsketching methods and randomized iterative solvers (e.g., randomized Kaczmarz\nmethod, randomized Gauss-Seidel). As a consequence, we exploit this connection\nto (1) produce a stronger, more precise convergence theory for such randomized\niterative solvers under arbitrary sampling schemes (i.i.d., adaptive,\npermutation, dependent, etc.), and (2) improve the rates of convergence of\nrandomized iterative solvers at the expense of a user-determined increases in\nper-iteration computational and storage costs.

We show that the authentication phases can be very short\nsince this form of authentication itself, when possible, can be achieved for\nmessage sets whose size grow doubly exponentially in blocklength. This leads to\nour result that the authenticated communication capacity region of a discrete\nmemoryless MAC is either zero or the (unauthenticated) MAC capacity region\nitself. This also, arguably, explains the similar nature of authenticated\ncommunication capacity of a discrete memoryless point-to-point adversarial\nchannel recently found by Kosut and Kliewer (ITW, 2018).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 16:37:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-29"}

The\nremaining, \"quantum\" part of current noise is therefore responsible for the\npotential violation of TUR in such quantum systems.

A\nmeasurement of a physical observable performed on one system then had to have\nan immediate effect on the conjugate observable in the other system - even if\nthe systems were causally disconnected!

In the parton model of\nthe nucleon formulated by Bjorken, Feynman, and Gribov, the partons (quarks and\ngluons) are viewed by an external hard probe as independent.

Yet, the parton and\nthe rest of the nucleon have to form a colour-singlet state due to colour\nconfinement, and so have to be in strongly correlated quantum states - we thus\nencounter the EPR paradox at the sub-nucleonic scale.

One strategy to solve them in an approximate way is to translate\nthem into a sequence of convex feasibility problems via the recently developed\nlevel set scheme and then solve each feasibility problem using projection\nmethods. However, if the problem is ill-conditioned, projection methods often\nshow zigzagging behavior and therefore converge slowly.\n  To address this issue, we exploit the bounded perturbation resilience of the\nprojection methods and introduce two new perturbations which avoid zigzagging\nbehavior. The first perturbation is in the spirit of $k$-step methods and uses\ngradient information from previous iterates. The second uses the approach of\nsurrogate constraint methods combined with relaxed, averaged projections.\n  We apply two different projection methods in the unperturbed version, as well\nas the two perturbed versions, to linear feasibility problems along with\nnonlinear optimization problems arising from intensity-modulated radiation\ntherapy (IMRT) treatment planning. We demonstrate that for all the considered\nproblems the perturbations can significantly accelerate the convergence of the\nprojection methods and hence the overall procedure of the level set scheme.

This missing geometry can be fundamentally limiting for many\napplications, e.g., a robot needs to know the unseen geometry to perform a\nprecise grasp on an object. Thus, we introduce the task of semantic instance\ncompletion: from an incomplete RGB-D scan of a scene, we aim to detect the\nindividual object instances and infer their complete object geometry. This will\nopen up new possibilities for interactions with objects in a scene, for\ninstance for virtual or robotic agents. We tackle this problem by introducing\nRevealNet, a new data-driven approach that jointly detects object instances and\npredicts their complete geometry. This enables a semantically meaningful\ndecomposition of a scanned scene into individual, complete 3D objects,\nincluding hidden and unobserved object parts. RevealNet is an end-to-end 3D\nneural network architecture that leverages joint color and geometry feature\nlearning. The fully-convolutional nature of our 3D network enables efficient\ninference of semantic instance completion for 3D scans at scale of large indoor\nenvironments in a single forward pass. We show that predicting complete object\ngeometry improves both 3D detection and instance segmentation performance. We\nevaluate on both real and synthetic scan benchmark data for the new task, where\nwe outperform state-of-the-art approaches by over 15 in mAP@0.5 on ScanNet, and\nover 18 in mAP@0.5 on SUNCG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 18:33:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Sep 2019 14:23:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 19:16:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-13"}

In a\nbasic and traditional formulation a separate model is fit for each value of the\ncategorical feature, using only the data that has the specific categorical\nvalue. To this formulation we add Laplacian regularization, which encourages\nthe model parameters for neighboring categorical values to be similar.\nLaplacian regularization allows us to specify one or more weighted graphs on\nthe stratification feature values. For example, stratifying over the days of\nthe week, we can specify that the Sunday model parameter should be close to the\nSaturday and Monday model parameters. The regularization improves the\nperformance of the model over the traditional stratified model, since the model\nfor each value of the categorical `borrows strength' from its neighbors. In\nparticular, it produces a model even for categorical values that did not appear\nin the training data set.\n  We propose an efficient distributed method for fitting stratified models,\nbased on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). When the\nfitting loss functions are convex, the stratified model fitting problem is\nconvex, and our method computes the global minimizer of the loss plus\nregularization; in other cases it computes a local minimizer. The method is\nvery efficient, and naturally scales to large data sets or numbers of\nstratified feature values.

When the initial periapsis is less\nthan about 15 gravitational radii, a large fraction of the shocked gas is\nunbound in the form of a collision-induced outflow (CIO). This is because large\napsidal precession causes the stream to self-intersect near the local escape\nspeed at radius much below the apocenter. The rest of the fallback gas is left\nin more tightly bound orbits and quickly joins the accretion flow. We propose\nthat the CIO is responsible for reprocessing the hard emission from the\naccretion flow into the optical band. This picture naturally explains the large\nphotospheric radius (or low blackbody temperature) and typical widths of the H\nand/or He emission lines seen in optical TDEs. We predict the CIO-reprocessed\nspectrum in the infrared to be L_\\nu ~ \\nu^{~0.5}, shallower than a blackbody.\nThe partial sky coverage of the CIO also provides a unification of the diverse\nX-ray behaviors of optical TDEs. According to this picture, optical surveys\nfilter out a large fraction of TDEs with low-mass blackholes due to lack of a\nreprocessing layer, and the volumetric rate of optical TDEs is nearly flat wrt.\nthe blackhole mass for M < 10^7 solar masses. This filtering causes the optical\nTDE rate to be lower than the total rate by a factor of ~10 or more. When the\nCIO is decelerated by the ambient medium, radio emission at the level of that\nin ASASSN-14li may be produced, but the timescales and peak luminosities can be\nhighly diverse. Finally, our method paves the way for global simulations of the\ndisk formation process by injecting gas at the intersection point according to\nthe prescribed velocity and density profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 19:22:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 2019 23:29:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

This review focuses on the formation and\nevolution of flare-productive ARs from both observational and theoretical\npoints of view. Starting from a general introduction of the genesis of ARs and\nsolar flares, we give an overview of the key observational features during the\nlong-term evolution in the pre-flare state, the rapid changes in the magnetic\nfield associated with the flare occurrence, and the physical mechanisms behind\nthese phenomena. Our picture of flare-productive ARs is summarized as follows:\nsubject to the turbulent convection, the rising magnetic flux in the interior\ndeforms into a complex structure and gains high non-potentiality; as the flux\nappears on the surface, an AR with large free magnetic energy and helicity is\nbuilt, which is represented by delta-sunspots, sheared polarity inversion\nlines, magnetic flux ropes, etc; the flare occurs when sufficient magnetic\nenergy has accumulated, and the drastic coronal evolution affects magnetic\nfields even in the photosphere. We show that the improvement of observational\ninstruments and modeling capabilities has significantly advanced our\nunderstanding in the last decades. Finally, we discuss the outstanding issues\nand future perspective and further broaden our scope to the possible\napplications of our knowledge to space-weather forecasting, extreme events in\nhistory, and corresponding stellar activities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 19:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

We extend this simulation\nfrom 3 to 12 binary orbital periods. We find that relativistic SMBBH accretion\nacts as a resonant cavity, where quasi-periodic oscillations tied to the the\nfrequency at which the black hole's orbital phase matches a non-linear $m=1$\ndensity feature, or ``lump'', in the circumbinary accretion disk permeate the\nsystem. The rate of mass accretion onto each of the mini-disks around the black\nholes is modulated at the beat frequency between the binary frequency and the\nlump's mean orbital frequency, i.e., $\\Omega_{\\rm beat} = \\Omega_{\\rm bin} -\n\\bar{\\Omega}_{\\rm lump}$, while the total mass accretion rate of this\nequal-mass binary is modulated at two different frequencies, $\\gtrsim\n\\bar{\\Omega}_{\\rm lump}$ and $\\approx 2 \\Omega_{\\rm beat}$. The instantaneous\nrotation rate of the lump itself is also modulated at two frequencies close to\nthe modulation frequencies of the total accretion rate, $\\bar{\\Omega}_{\\rm\nlump}$ and $2 \\Omega_{\\rm beat}$. Because of the compact nature of the\nmini-disks in SMBBHs approaching merger, the inflow times within the mini-disks\nare comparable to the period on which their mass-supply varies, so that their\nmasses---and the accretion rates they supply to their black holes---are\nstrongly modulated at the same frequency. In essence, the azimuthal symmetry of\nthe circumbinary disk is broken by the dynamics of orbits near a binary, and\nthis $m=1$ asymmetry then drives quasi-periodic variation throughout the\nsystem, including both accretion and disk-feeding. In SMBBHs approaching\nmerger, such time variability could introduce distinctive, increasingly rapid,\nfluctuations in their electromagnetic emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 20:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

To maintain polarization in a\npolarized proton collider, it is important to know the spin tune of the\npolarized proton beam, which is defined as the number of full spin precessions\nper revolution. A nine-magnet spin flipper has demonstrated high spin-flip\nefficiency in the presence of two Siberian snakes [1]. The spin flipper drives\na spin resonance with a given frequency (or tune) and strength. When the drive\ntune is close to the spin tune, the proton spin direction is not vertical\nanymore, but precesses around the vertical direction. By measuring the\nprecession frequency of the horizontal component the spin tune can be precisely\nmeasured. A driven coherent spin motion and fast turn-by-turn polarization\nmeasurement are keys to the measurement. The vertical spin direction is\nrestored after turning the spin flipper off and the polarization value is not\naffected by the measurement. The fact that this manipulation preserves the\npolarization makes it possible to measure the spin tune during operation of a\nhigh energy accelerator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 21:05:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

Second, the opinions of\neighteen experts from industry and academia regarding inter-relations between\nthese barriers are recorded. Third, a multicriteria decision making (MCDM)\ntechnique, the grey-based Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory\n(Grey-DEMATEL), is applied to characterize the structure of relationships\nbetween the barriers. Fourth, robustness of the results is tested using\nsensitivity analysis. Fifth, the key results are depicted in a causal loop\ndiagram (CLD), a systems thinking approach, to comprehend cause-and-effect\nrelationships between the barriers. The results indicate that the lack of\ncustomer acceptance (LCA) is the most prominent barrier, the one which should\nbe addressed at the highest priority. The CLD suggests that LCA can be rather\nmitigated by addressing two other prominent, yet more tangible, barriers --\nlack of industry standards and the absence of regulations and certifications.\nThe study's overarching contribution thus lies in bringing to fore multiple\nbarriers to AV adoption and their potential influences on each other.

An amplification procedure is valid if no algorithm can\ndistinguish the set of $m$ samples produced by the amplifier from a set of $m$\nindependent draws from $D$, with probability greater than $2/3$. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, in many settings, a valid amplification procedure exists, even\nwhen the size of the input dataset, $n$, is significantly less than what would\nbe necessary to learn $D$ to non-trivial accuracy.

By factorizing the (rating) matrix into the product of\nlow-dimensional latent embeddings of rows (users) and columns (items), a\nmajority of existing matrix completion methods are transductive, since the\nlearned embeddings cannot generalize to unseen rows/columns or to new matrices.\nTo make matrix completion inductive, most previous works use content (side\ninformation), such as user's age or movie's genre, to make predictions.\nHowever, high-quality content is not always available, and can be hard to\nextract. Under the extreme setting where not any side information is available\nother than the matrix to complete, can we still learn an inductive matrix\ncompletion model? In this paper, we propose an Inductive Graph-based Matrix\nCompletion (IGMC) model to address this problem. IGMC trains a graph neural\nnetwork (GNN) based purely on 1-hop subgraphs around (user, item) pairs\ngenerated from the rating matrix and maps these subgraphs to their\ncorresponding ratings. It achieves highly competitive performance with\nstate-of-the-art transductive baselines. In addition, IGMC is inductive -- it\ncan generalize to users/items unseen during the training (given that their\ninteractions exist), and can even transfer to new tasks. Our transfer learning\nexperiments show that a model trained out of the MovieLens dataset can be\ndirectly used to predict Douban movie ratings with surprisingly good\nperformance. Our work demonstrates that: 1) it is possible to train inductive\nmatrix completion models without using side information while achieving similar\nor better performances than state-of-the-art transductive methods; 2) local\ngraph patterns around a (user, item) pair are effective predictors of the\nrating this user gives to the item; and 3) Long-range dependencies might not be\nnecessary for modeling recommender systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 21:58:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Oct 2019 03:08:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 04:27:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

First, we calculate the contribution of the\nterms of quadrupole, octupole, and hexadecapolar order of the secular\napproximation of the potential to the outer particle's $\\omega_2$ precession\nrate $(d\\omega_2/d\\tau)$. Then, we derive analytical criteria that determine\nthe vanishing of the $\\omega_2$ quadrupole precession rate\n$(d\\omega_2/d\\tau)_{\\text{quad}}$ for different values of the inner perturber's\neccentricity $e_1$. Finally, we use such analytical considerations and describe\nthe behavior of $\\omega_2$ of outer particles extracted from N-body\nsimulations. Our analytical study indicates that the values of the inclination\n$i_2$ and the ascending node longitude $\\Omega_2$ associated with the outer\nparticle that vanish $(d\\omega_2/d\\tau)_{\\text{quad}}$ strongly depend on the\neccentricity $e_1$ of the inner perturber.

Unlike typically stable 1D solitons, 2D and 3D ones are\nvulnerable to instabilities induced by the critical and supercritical collapse,\nrespectively, in the 2D and 3D models with cubic focusing nonlinearity. Vortex\nsolitons are subject to a still stronger splitting instability. For this\nreason, a central problem is looking for physical settings in which 2D and 3D\nsolitons may be stabilized. The review addresses, first, two well-established\ntopics, viz., the stabilization of vortex solitons by means of competing\nnonlinearities, or by trapping potentials (harmonic-oscillator and\nspatially-periodic ones). The former topic includes a new addition, viz., the\nprediction of robust quantum droplets. Two other topics outline new schemes\nelaborated for the creation of stable vortical solitons. One scheme relies on\nthe use of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in binary BEC, making it possible to\npredict stable 2D and 3D solitons, which couple or mix components with\nvorticities S=0 and (+/-)1 (semi-vortices (SVs) or mixed modes (MMs),\nrespectively). In this system, the situation is different in the 2D and 3D\ngeometries. In 2D, SOC helps to create a ground state (GS), represented by\nstable SV or MM solitons, whose norm falls below the threshold value at which\nthe critical collapse sets in. In the 3D geometry, the supercritical collapse\ndoes not allow one to create a GS, but metastable solitons of the SV and MM\ntypes can be constructed. Another new scheme makes it possible to create stable\n2D vortex-ring solitons with arbitrarily high S in a binary BEC with components\ncoupled by microwave radiation. Some other topics are addressed too, such as\nvortex solitons in dissipative media and attempts to create vortex solitons in\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2019 01:06:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

One main difficulty\narises from the interaction between the transport operator and the\nvelocity-diffusion-type collision operator in the non-cutoff Boltzmann and\nLandau equations; another major difficulty is the potential formation of\nsingularities for solutions to the boundary value problem. In the present work\nwe introduce a new function space with low regularity in the spatial variable\nto treat the problem in cases when the spatial domain is either a torus, or a\nfinite channel with boundary.

As an\nautoregressive (AR) model, WaveNet is limited by a slow sequential waveform\ngeneration process. Some new models that use the inverse-autoregressive flow\n(IAF) can generate a whole waveform in a one-shot manner. However, these\nIAF-based models require sequential transformation during training, which\nseverely slows down the training speed. Other models such as Parallel WaveNet\nand ClariNet bring together the benefits of AR and IAF-based models and train\nan IAF model by transferring the knowledge from a pre-trained AR teacher to an\nIAF student without any sequential transformation. However, both models require\nadditional training criteria, and their implementation is prohibitively\ncomplicated.\n  We propose a framework for neural source-filter (NSF) waveform modeling\nwithout AR nor IAF-based approaches. This framework requires only three\ncomponents for waveform generation: a source module that generates a sine-based\nsignal as excitation, a non-AR dilated-convolution-based filter module that\ntransforms the excitation into a waveform, and a conditional module that\npre-processes the acoustic features for the source and filer modules. This\nframework minimizes spectral-amplitude distances for model training, which can\nbe efficiently implemented by using short-time Fourier transform routines.\nUnder this framework, we designed three NSF models and compared them with\nWaveNet.

It is a critical component in neuroimage\nprocessing pipelines. Downstream deformable registration and whole brain\nsegmentation performance is highly dependent on accurate skullstripping.\nSkullstripping is an especially challenging task for infant~(age range 0--18\nmonths) head MRI images due to the significant size and shape variability of\nthe head and the brain in that age range. Infant brain tissue development also\nchanges the $T_1$-weighted image contrast over time, making consistent\nskullstripping a difficult task. Existing tools for adult brain MRI\nskullstripping are ill equipped to handle these variations and a specialized\ninfant MRI skullstripping algorithm is necessary. In this paper, we describe a\nsupervised skullstripping algorithm that utilizes three trained fully\nconvolutional neural networks~(CNN), each of which segments 2D $T_1$-weighted\nslices in axial, coronal, and sagittal views respectively. The three\nprobabilistic segmentations in the three views are linearly fused and\nthresholded to produce a final brain mask. We compared our method to existing\nadult and infant skullstripping algorithms and showed significant improvement\nbased on Dice overlap metric~(average Dice of 0.97) with a manually labeled\nground truth data set. Label fusion experiments on multiple, unlabeled data\nsets show that our method is consistent and has fewer failure modes.

We describe an approach to automatically\ngenerate process plans for support removal using a multi-axis machining\ninstrument. The goal is to fracture the contact regions between each support\ncomponent and the part, and to do it in the most cost-effective order while\navoiding collisions with evolving near-net shape, including the remaining\nsupport components. A recursive algorithm identifies a maximal collection of\nsupport components whose connection regions to the part are accessible as well\nas the orientations at which they can be removed at a given round. For every\nsuch region, the accessible orientations appear as a 'fiber' in the\ncollision-free space of the evolving near-net shape and the tool assembly. To\norder the removal of accessible supports, the algorithm constructs a search\ngraph whose edges are weighted by the Riemannian distance between the fibers.\nThe least expensive process plan is obtained by solving a traveling salesman\nproblem (TSP) over the search graph. The sequence of configurations obtained by\nsolving TSP is used as the input to a motion planner that finds collision free\npaths to visit all accessible features. The resulting part without the support\nstructure can then be finished using traditional machining to produce the\nintended design.

In this\nresearch, we propose a novel and distinctive approach to develop an incremental\npersonalized e-mail spam filter. The proposed work is described using three\nsignificant contributions. First, we applied a novel term frequency difference\nand category ratio based feature selection function TFDCR to select the most\ndiscriminating features irrespective of the number of samples in each class.\nSecond, an incremental learning model is used which enables the classifier to\nupdate the discriminant function dynamically. Third, a heuristic function\ncalled selectionRankWeight is introduced to upgrade the existing feature set\nthat determines new features carrying strong discriminating ability from an\nincoming set of e-mails. Three public e-mail datasets possessing different\ncharacteristics are used to evaluate the filter performance. Experiments are\nconducted to compare the feature selection efficiency of TFDCR and to observe\nthe filter performance under both the batch and the incremental learning mode.\nThe results demonstrate the superiority of TFDCR as the most effective f eature\nselection function. The incremental learning model incorporating dynamic\nfeature update function overcomes the problem of drifting concepts. The\nproposed filter validates its efficiency and feasibility by substantially\nimproving the classification accuracy and reducing the false positive error of\nmisclassifying legitimate e-mail as spam.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2019 07:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

In the mean field theory (the\nBrownian force model), it is known that the avalanches are uncorrelated. Here\nwe obtain a simple field theory which describes the first deviations from this\nuncorrelated behavior in a $\\epsilon=d_c-d$ expansion below the upper critical\ndimension $d_c$ of the model. We apply it to calculate the correlations between\n(i) avalanche sizes (ii) avalanche dynamics in two successive avalanches, or\nmore generally, in two avalanches separated by a uniform displacement $W$ of\nthe interface. For (i) we obtain the correlations of the total sizes, of the\nlocal sizes and of the total sizes with given seeds (starting points). For (ii)\nwe obtain the correlations of the velocities, of the durations, and of the\navalanche shapes. In general we find that the avalanches are {\\it\nanti-correlated}, the occurence of a larger avalanche making more likely the\noccurence of a smaller one, and vice-versa. Examining the universality of our\nresults leads us to conjecture several new exact scaling relations for the\ncritical exponents that characterize the different distributions of\ncorrelations. The avalanche size predictions are confronted to numerical\nsimulations for a $d=1$ interface with short range elasticity.

Using these operators, they characterised the parameterised\ncomplexity of natural problems on graphs. In the spirit of the operators paraW\nand paraBeta by Stockhusen and Tantau, we introduce variants based on\ntail-nondeterminism, paraW[1] and paraBeta-Tail. Then, we consider counting\nversions of all four operators applied to logspace and obtain several natural\ncomplete problems for the resulting classes: counting of paths in digraphs,\ncounting first-order models for formulas, and counting graph homomorphisms.\nFurthermore, we show that the complexity of a parameterised variant of the\ndeterminant function for (0,1)-matrices is #paraBeta-Tail-L-hard and can be\nwritten as the difference of two functions in #paraBetaTail-L. For example, we\nshow that the closure of #paraBetaTail-L under parameterised logspace\nparsimonious reductions coincides with #paraBeta-L, that is, modulo\nparameterised reductions, tail-nondeterminism with read-once access is the same\nas read-once nondeterminism.

The influence maximization problem is NP-hard, and therefore, there\nwill not exist a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the problem unless P=NP.\nMany heuristics are proposed to find a nearly good solution in a shorter time.\n  In this paper, we propose two heuristic algorithms to find good solutions.\nThe heuristics are based on two ideas: (1) vertices of high degree have more\ninfluence in the network, and (2) nearby vertices influence on almost analogous\nsets of vertices. We evaluate our algorithms on several well-known data sets\nand show that our heuristics achieve better results (up to $15\\%$ in influence\nspread) for this problem in a shorter time (up to $85\\%$ improvement in the\nrunning time).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2019 14:48:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

The criteria for the modulational instability of IAWs, and the basic\nfeatures of finite amplitude IARWs are identified. The modulationally stable\nand unstable regions are determined by the sign of the ratio of the dispersive\ncoefficient to the nonlinear coefficient of NLSE.

Methods are tested and compared using a microscopic\nurban mobility simulator, SUMO and a network simulator, ns-2, for the\nsimulation of communication between CVs. Compared to the Back-Propagation\nalgorithm (BP) extensively used in the past literature, our performance\nevaluation shows that the proposed methods enhance the estimation of the cause\nof congestion by 48\\% for the proposed VP, 58\\% for the BF, 71\\% for the DAT\nand 70\\% for \\textbeta-DAT. The methods also enhance detection time from 7.09\\%\nto 10.3\\%, and \\textbeta-DAT outperforms BP by approximately 1.25\\% less false\nalarms triggered by the network, which can be significant in the context of\nreal-time decision making. We show that a market penetration rate between 63\\%\nand 75\\% is enough to ensure satisfactory performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 17:29:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 17:03:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

However, it is often time-consuming to examine\neach user review to identify the desired information. In this paper, we propose\na novel review-driven framework for answer generation for product-related\nquestions in E-commerce, named RAGE. We develope RAGE on the basis of the\nmulti-layer convolutional architecture to facilitate speed-up of answer\ngeneration with the parallel computation. For each question, RAGE first\nextracts the relevant review snippets from the reviews of the corresponding\nproduct. Then, we devise a mechanism to identify the relevant information from\nthe noise-prone review snippets and incorporate this information to guide the\nanswer generation. The experiments on two real-world E-Commerce datasets show\nthat the proposed RAGE significantly outperforms the existing alternatives in\nproducing more accurate and informative answers in natural language. Moreover,\nRAGE takes much less time for both model training and answer generation than\nthe existing RNN based generation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2019 01:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

Following R. Penrose, \"the world\" is\nmodelled by a closed Friedman--Lemaitre type universe, in which a\nthree-dimensional spherical \"space\" is filled with \"matter\" consisting of $N$\npoint particles, their large-scale distribution being influenced by their own\ngravity. As \"entropy of matter\" the Boltzmann entropy for a (semi-)classical\nmacrostate, and Boltzmann's ergodic ensemble formulation of it for an isolated\nthermal equilibrium state, are studied. Since the notion of a Boltzmann entropy\nis not restricted to classical non-relativistic physics, the inquiry will take\ninto account quantum theory as well as relativity theory; we also consider\nblack hole entropy. Model universes having a maximum entropy state and those\nwhich don't will be encountered. It is found that the answer to our maximum\nentropy question is not at all straightforward at the general-relativistic\nlevel. In particular, it is shown that the increase in Bekenstein--Hawking\nentropy of general-relativistic black holes does not always compensate for the\nBoltzmann entropy of a piece of matter swallowed by a black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 20:34:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 May 2019 20:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}

We begin by reviewing corresponding\nmodels from the classical theory of linear elasticity. This review includes a\nnew elementary and self-contained proof that there are exactly four material\nsymmetry classes of the elasticity tensor in two dimensions. We also summarize\nclassical plane strain and plane stress linear elastic models and explore their\nconnections to the pure two-dimensional linear elastic model, relying on the\ndefinitions of the engineering constants. We then provide a novel formulation\nfor pure two-dimensional anisotropic bond-based linear peridynamic models,\nwhich accommodates all four material symmetry classes. We further present\ninnovative formulations for peridynamic plane strain and plane stress, which\nare obtained using direct analogies of the classical planar elasticity\nassumptions, and we specialize these formulations to a variety of material\nsymmetry classes. The presented anisotropic peridynamic models are constrained\nby Cauchy's relations, which are an intrinsic property of bond-based\nperidynamic models. The uniqueness of the presented peridynamic plane strain\nand plane stress formulations in this work is that we directly reduce\nthree-dimensional models to two-dimensional formulations, as opposed to\nmatching two-dimensional peridynamic models to classical plane strain and plane\nstress formulations. This results in significant computational savings, while\nretaining the dynamics of the original three-dimensional bond-based peridynamic\nproblems under suitable assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 19:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}
