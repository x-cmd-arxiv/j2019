A fundamental problem on\nuncertain graphs is the s-t reliability, which measures the probability that a\ntarget node t is reachable from a source node s in a probabilistic (or\nuncertain) graph, i.e., a graph where every edge is assigned a probability of\nexistence.\n  Due to the inherent complexity of the s-t reliability estimation problem\n(#P-hard), various sampling and indexing based efficient algorithms were\nproposed in the literature. However, since they have not been thoroughly\ncompared with each other, it is not clear whether the later algorithm\noutperforms the earlier ones. More importantly, the comparison framework,\ndatasets, and metrics were often not consistent (e.g., different convergence\ncriteria were employed to find the optimal number of samples) across these\nworks.

After defining the\ntheory-independent notions of Bell non-locality and KS contextuality for ideal\nmeasurements, we show that, in quantum theory, due to Neumark's dilation\ntheorem, every matrix of quantum Bell non-local correlations can be mapped to\nan identical matrix of KS contextual correlations produced in a scenario with\nidentical relations of compatibility but where measurements are ideal and no\nspace-like separation is required.

A fundamental step to incorporating Twitter data in\npharmacoepidemiological research is to automatically recognize medication\nmentions in tweets. Given that lexical searches for medication names may fail\ndue to misspellings or ambiguity with common words, we propose a more advanced\nmethod to recognize them. Methods: We present Kusuri, an Ensemble Learning\nclassifier, able to identify tweets mentioning drug products and dietary\nsupplements. Kusuri (\"medication\" in Japanese) is composed of two modules.\nFirst, four different classifiers (lexicon-based, spelling-variant-based,\npattern-based and one based on a weakly-trained neural network) are applied in\nparallel to discover tweets potentially containing medication names. Second, an\nensemble of deep neural networks encoding morphological, semantical and\nlong-range dependencies of important words in the tweets discovered is used to\nmake the final decision. Results: On a balanced (50-50) corpus of 15,005\ntweets, Kusuri demonstrated performances close to human annotators with 93.7%\nF1-score, the best score achieved thus far on this corpus. On a corpus made of\nall tweets posted by 113 Twitter users (98,959 tweets, with only 0.26%\nmentioning medications), Kusuri obtained 76.3% F1-score.

Excellent quantitative agreement with previous exact diagonalization\nresults establishes the veracity of the method. Application of the method to a\nmodel system of binary mass and FC-disordered system leads to several findings.\nA narrow resonance, significantly below the van Hove singularity, that has been\ntermed as the boson peak, is seen to emerge for low soft particle\nconcentrations. We show, using the typical phonon spectrum, that the states\nconstituting the boson peak cross over from being completely localized to being\nextended as a function of increasing soft particle concentration. In general,\nan interplay of mass and FC disorder is found to be cooperative in nature,\nenhancing phonon localization over all frequencies. However, for certain range\nof frequencies, and depending on material parameters, FC disorder can\ndelocalize the states that were localized by mass disorder, and vice-versa.\nModeling vacancies as weakly bonded sites with vanishing mass, we find that\nvacancies, even at very low concentrations, are extremely effective in\nlocalizing phonons. Thus, inducing vacancies is proposed as a promising route\nfor efficient thermoelectrics. Finally, we use model parameters corresponding\nto the alloy system, Ni1-xPtx, and show that mass disorder alone is\ninsufficient to explain the pseudogap in the phonon spectrum; the concomitant\npresence of FC disorder is necessary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 17:36:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 May 2019 14:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

Following this idea, different time integration schemes can be\ncoupled. In this context, we developed a hybrid time integration scheme that\nspatially couples the explicit scheme of Heun and the implicit scheme of Crank\nand Nicolson using a dedicated transition function. This scheme is linearly\nstable and second-order accurate. In this paper, an extension of this hybrid\nscheme is introduced to deal with a temporal adaptive procedure. The idea is to\ntreat the time integration procedure with unstructured grids as it is performed\nwith Cartesian grids with local mesh refinement. Depending on its\ncharacteristic size, each mesh cell is assigned a rank. And for two cells from\ntwo consecutive ranks, the ratio of the associated time steps for time marching\nthe solutions is $2$. As a consequence, the cells with the lowest rank iterate\nmore than the other ones to reach the same physical time. In a finite-volume\ncontext, a key ingredient is to keep the conservation property for the\ninterfaces that separate two cells of different ranks. After introducing the\ndifferent schemes, the paper recalls briefly the coupling procedure, and\ndetails the extension to the temporal adaptive procedure.

This subsample includes six\ndetected planets and three brown dwarfs; from these detections and our contrast\ncurves we infer the underlying distributions of substellar companions with\nrespect to their mass, semi-major axis, and host stellar mass. We uncover a\nstrong correlation between planet occurrence rate and host star mass, with\nstars M $>$ 1.5 $M_\\odot$ more likely to host planets with masses between 2-13\nM$_{\\rm Jup}$ and semi-major axes of 3-100 au at 99.92% confidence. We fit a\ndouble power-law model in planet mass (m) and semi-major axis (a) for planet\npopulations around high-mass stars (M $>$ 1.5M$_\\odot$) of the form $\\frac{d^2\nN}{dm da} \\propto m^\\alpha a^\\beta$, finding $\\alpha$ = -2.4 $\\pm$ 0.8 and\n$\\beta$ = -2.0 $\\pm$ 0.5, and an integrated occurrence rate of $9^{+5}_{-4}$%\nbetween 5-13 M$_{\\rm Jup}$ and 10-100 au.

Brown dwarfs also appear to be distributed differently in mass and\nsemi-major axis compared to giant planets; whereas giant planets follow a\nbottom-heavy mass distribution and favor smaller semi-major axes, brown dwarfs\nexhibit just the opposite behaviors. Comparing to studies of short-period giant\nplanets from the RV method, our results are consistent with a peak in\noccurrence of giant planets between ~1-10 au. We discuss how these trends,\nincluding the preference of giant planets for high-mass host stars, point to\nformation of giant planets by core/pebble accretion, and formation of brown\ndwarfs by gravitational instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

Correcting for these biases has become very\nimportant as imaging studies increase in size and multi-site cases become more\ncommon. We propose learning an intermediate representation invariant to\nsite/protocol variables, a technique adapted from information theory-based\nalgorithmic fairness; by leveraging the data processing inequality, such a\nrepresentation can then be used to create an image reconstruction that is\nuninformative of its original source, yet still faithful to underlying\nstructures. To implement this, we use a deep learning method based on\nvariational auto-encoders (VAE) to construct scanner invariant encodings of the\nimaging data.\n  Results: To evaluate our method, we use training data from the 2018 MICCAI\nComputational Diffusion MRI (CDMRI) Challenge Harmonization dataset. Our\nproposed method shows improvements on independent test data relative to a\nrecently published baseline method on each subtask, mapping data from three\ndifferent scanning contexts to and from one separate target scanning context.\n  Conclusion: As imaging studies continue to grow, the use of pooled multi-site\nimaging will similarly increase.

However, most\nspecification mining, anomaly detection and other such algorithms assume, or\neven require, perfect data quality to function properly. Such algorithms may\nwork in lab conditions when given clean, controlled data, but will fail in the\nfield when given imperfect data. We propose a method for accurately\nreconstructing discrete temporal or sequential system traces affected by data\nloss, using Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs). The model works by\nlearning to predict the next event in a sequence of events, and uses its own\noutput as an input to continue predicting future events. As a result, this\nmethod can be used for data restoration even with streamed data. Such a method\ncan reconstruct even long sequence of missing events, and can also help\nvalidate and improve data quality for noisy data. The output of the model will\nbe a close reconstruction of the true data, and can be fed to algorithms that\nrely on clean data. We demonstrate our method by reconstructing automotive CAN\ntraces consisting of long sequences of discrete events. We show that given even\nsmall parts of a CAN trace, our LSTM model can predict future events with an\naccuracy of almost 90%, and can successfully reconstruct large portions of the\noriginal trace, greatly outperforming a Markov Model benchmark.

We calculated the CO self- and mutual-shielding functions\nin an expanding envelope. We investigated the dependence of the CO profile on\nthe five fundamental parameters mass-loss rate, the expansion velocity, the CO\ninitial abundance, the CO excitation temperature, and the strength of the ISRF.\nOur derived CO envelope size is smaller than the commonly used radius derived\nby Mamon et al. 1988. The difference between results varies from 1% to 39% and\ndepends on the H2 and CO densities of the envelope. We list two fitting\nparameters for a large grid of models to estimate the CO abundance\ndistribution. We demonstrate that the CO envelope size can differ between\noutflows with the same effective content of CO, but different CO abundance,\nmass-loss rate, and the expansion velocity as a consequence of differing\namounts of shielding by H2 and CO. We find that the abundance of CO close to\nthe star and the outflow density both can have a significant effect on the size\nof the molecular envelope. We also demonstrate that modest variations in the\nISRF can cause measurable differences in the envelope extent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 20:17:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

This area is merely the footprint of\nthe coronal post-flare loops, whose contraction increases their shear field\ncomponent and the magnetic energy density in line with the ideal induction\nequation. For simulated data, we computed the Lorentz force density map by\napplying the method used in observations. We obtained increase of the downward\ncomponent of the Lorentz force density around the PIL -consistent with\nobservations. However, this significantly differs from the Lorentz force\ndensity maps obtained directly from the 3D magnetic field and current. These\nresults altogether question previous interpretations based on the implosion\nconjecture and momentum conservation with the CME, and rather imply that the\nobserved increases in photospheric horizontal magnetic fields result from the\nreconnection-driven contraction of sheared flare-loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 21:20:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 20:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

The issue of how\nto adapt or re-design convolutional codes (decoded by the Viterbi algorithm)\nand LDPC codes (decoded by the sum-product algorithm and optimized by using the\nEXIT chart method) to effectively handle the overall non-Gaussian ARI noise is\ninvestigated. A decoding metric is derived from the non-Gaussian ARI channel\ntransition probability as a function of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and\nInterference-to-Noise Ratio (INR).\n  Two design methodologies are benchmarked against a baseline \"unaltered legacy\nsystem\", where a code designed for AWGN-only noise, but used on the\nnon-Gaussian ARI channel, is decoded by using the AWGN-only metric (i.e., as if\nINR is zero). The methodologies are: M1) codes designed for AWGN-only noise,\nbut decoded with the new metric that accounts for both SNR and INR; and M2)\ncodes optimized for the overall non-Gaussian ARI channel. Both methodologies\ngive better average Bit Error Rate (BER) in the high INR regime compared to the\nbaseline. In the low INR regime, both methodologies perform as the baseline\nsince in this case the radar interference is weak. Interestingly, the\nperformance improvement of M2 over M1 is minimal. In practice, this implies\nthat specifications in terms of channel error correcting codes for commercially\navailable wireless systems need not be changed, and that it suffices to use an\nappropriate INR-based decoding metric in order to effectively cope with the\nARI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 00:04:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-12"}

This is a\nfar more challenging noise model than bit-flip~noise or erasure noise; indeed,\neven the simplest case in which the population size is 1 (corresponding to a\ntrivial distribution supported on a single string) corresponds to the\n\\emph{trace reconstruction} problem, a challenging problem that has received\nmuch recent attention (see e.g.~\\cite{DOS17,NP17,PZ17,HPP18,HHP18}).\n  We give algorithms and lower bounds for population recovery under the\ndeletion channel when the population size is some $\\ell>1$.

In this paper, we study the\npolarization properties predicted by the emission model, in which (i) the\npulsed optical emission is produced by the synchrotron emission from\nrelativistic electrons trapped by magnetic field lines of the WD and (ii) the\nemission is mainly produced at magnetic mirror points of the electron motion.\nWe find that this model can reproduce the large swing of the polarization\nangle, provided that the distribution of the initial pitch angle of the\nelectrons that are leaving the M-type star is biased to a smaller angle rather\nthan a uniform distribution. The observed direction of the swing suggests that\nthe Earth viewing angle is less than $90^{\\circ}$ measured from the WD spin\naxis. The current model prefers an Earth viewing angle of\n$50^{\\circ}-60^{\\circ}$ and a magnetic inclination angle of\n$50^{\\circ}-60^{\\circ}$ (or $120^{\\circ}-130^{\\circ}$). We discuss that the\ndifferent contribution of the emission from M-type star to total emission\ncauses a large variation in the pulsed fraction and the degree of the linear\npolarization along the orbital phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 05:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

We call them volumetric benchmarks (VBs) because they\ngeneralize IBM's benchmark for measuring quantum volume \\cite{Cross18}.

A volumetric benchmark defines a family of\nrectangular quantum circuits, for which $d$ and $w$ are uncoupled to allow the\nstudy of time/space performance trade-offs. Each VB defines a mapping from\ncircuit shapes -- $(w,d)$ pairs -- to test suites $\\mathcal{C}(w,d)$. A test\nsuite is an ensemble of test circuits that share a common structure. The test\nsuite $\\mathcal{C}$ for a given circuit shape may be a single circuit $C$, a\nspecific list of circuits $\\{C_1\\ldots C_N\\}$ that must all be run, or a large\nset of possible circuits equipped with a distribution $Pr(C)$. The circuits in\na given VB share a structure, which is limited only by designers' creativity.\nWe list some known benchmarks, and other circuit families, that fit into the VB\nframework: several families of random circuits, periodic circuits, and\nalgorithm-inspired circuits. The last ingredient defining a benchmark is a\nsuccess criterion that defines when a processor is judged to have \"passed\" a\ngiven test circuit. We discuss several options. Benchmark data can be analyzed\nin many ways to extract many properties, but we propose a simple, universal\ngraphical summary of results that illustrates the Pareto frontier of the $d$ vs\n$w$ trade-off for the processor being benchmarked.\n  [1] A.

However, due to the joint optimization of the digital and\nanalog precoding matrices as well as extra constraints for the analog part, the\nhybrid precoding design is still a tough issue in current research. In this\npaper, we adopt the thought of clustering in unsupervised learning and provide\ndesign schemes for fully-connected hybrid precoding (FHP) and\nadaptively-connected hybrid precoding (AHP) in multi-user massive MIMO systems.\nFor FHP, we propose the hierarchical-agglomerative-clustering-based (HAC-based)\nscheme to explore the relevance among RF chains in optimal hybrid procoding\ndesign. The similar RF chains are merged into an individual RF chain when\ninsufficient RF chains are equipped at the base station (BS).

In this work, we\npresent a theoretical investigation into the ability of nanoinclusions to\nreduce the detrimental effect of bipolar transport. Using the quantum\nmechanical non equilibrium Greens function (NEGF) transport formalism, we\nsimulate electronic transport through two-dimensional systems containing\ndensely packed nanoinclusions, separated by distances similar to the electron\nmean free path.

The benefits from reducing the bipolar conductivity are larger the\nmore conductive the minority band is to begin with (larger hole mean free path\nin particular), as expected. Interestingly, however, the benefits on the\nSeebeck coefficient and the power factor are even more pronounced not only when\nthe minority mean free path is large, but when it is larger compared to the\nmajority conduction band mean free path.

On a fully-connected lattice with a large\nnumber of sites, the mean-field geometry leads to a negative binomial law for\nthe number of particles at each site, with parameters depending on the hopping,\ncreation and annihilation rates. This model of particles is mapped to a model\nof population dynamics: the site label is interpreted as a level of fitness,\nthe site-dependent creation rate is interpreted as a selection function, and\nthe hopping process is interpreted as the introduction of mutants. In the limit\nof large density, the fraction of the total population occupying each site\napproaches the limiting distribution in the house-of-cards model of\nselection-mutation, introduced by Kingman. A single site can be occupied by a\nmacroscopic fraction of the particles if the mutation rate is below a critical\nvalue (which matches the critical value worked out in the house-of-cards\nmodel).

This idea is formalized in\nthe concept of locally checkable labelings (LCLs), introduced by Naor and\nStockmeyer (1995). Recently, Chang et al. (2016) showed that in bounded-degree\ngraphs, every LCL problem belongs to one of the following classes:\n  - \"Easy\": solvable in $O(\\log^* n)$ rounds with both deterministic and\nrandomized distributed algorithms.\n  - \"Hard\": requires at least $\\Omega(\\log n)$ rounds with deterministic and\n$\\Omega(\\log \\log n)$ rounds with randomized distributed algorithms.\n  Hence for any parameterized LCL problem, when we move from local problems\ntowards global problems, there is some point at which complexity suddenly jumps\nfrom easy to hard. For example, for vertex coloring in $d$-regular graphs it is\nnow known that this jump is at precisely $d$ colors: coloring with $d+1$ colors\nis easy, while coloring with $d$ colors is hard.\n  However, it is currently poorly understood where this jump takes place when\none looks at defective colorings. To study this question, we define $k$-partial\n$c$-coloring as follows: nodes are labeled with numbers between $1$ and $c$,\nand every node is incident to at least $k$ properly colored edges.\n  It is known that $1$-partial $2$-coloring (a.k.a. weak $2$-coloring) is easy\nfor any $d \\ge 1$. As our main result, we show that $k$-partial $2$-coloring\nbecomes hard as soon as $k \\ge 2$, no matter how large a $d$ we have.\n  We also show that this is fundamentally different from $k$-partial\n$3$-coloring: no matter which $k \\ge 3$ we choose, the problem is always hard\nfor $d = k$ but it becomes easy when $d \\gg k$. The same was known previously\nfor partial $c$-coloring with $c \\ge 4$, but the case of $c < 4$ was open.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 11:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-12"}

Most methods based on deep convolutional neural\nnetwork (DCNN) have small receptive fields, and hence they are unable to\ncapture global context information of larger regions, with difficult to\nidentify lesions. The final segmented retina vessels contain more noise with\nlow classification accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a DCNN\nstructure named as D-Net. In the proposed D-Net, the dilation convolution is\nused in the backbone network to obtain a larger receptive field without losing\nspatial resolution, so as to reduce the loss of feature information and to\nreduce the difficulty of tiny thin vessels segmentation. The large receptive\nfield can better distinguished between the lesion area and the blood vessel\narea. In the proposed Multi-Scale Information Fusion module (MSIF), parallel\nconvolution layers with different dilation rates are used, so that the model\ncan obtain more dense feature information and better capture retinal vessel\ninformation of different sizes.

The theory\nassumes that customers infer less than rationally: when a price rises due to a\ncost increase, customers partially misattribute the higher price to a higher\nmarkup---which they find unfair. Firms anticipate this response and trim their\nprice increases, which drives the passthrough of costs into prices below one:\nprices are somewhat rigid. Embedded in a New Keynesian model as a replacement\nfor the usual pricing frictions, our theory produces monetary nonneutrality:\nwhen monetary policy loosens and inflation rises, customers misperceive markups\nas higher and feel unfairly treated; firms mitigate this perceived unfairness\nby reducing their markups; in general equilibrium, employment rises.

A feature of this model lies in its\napproximate linearization to the non-linear pressure dissolution process, which\nmakes this model compatible with existing numerical solute transport models.\nCase study shows that although usually only a thin layer of rock surface is\ninvaded by WRI, the mechanical weakening of this thin layer tend to induce\nsignificant increase in rock surface deformation. Thus, the distributed flow\nfield, mineral dissolution rates, and surface alteration increments etc., are\nall affected. This indicates that when fracture flow related issues are\nconcerned, we should focus on the top thin layer of rock surface rather than\nthe matrix. Results also show that fluid flow enhances the dissolution of rocks\nand development of flowing channels; however, at places where stress induces\nhigh pressure-dissolution but fluid flows slowly, minerals precipitate and fill\nup fracture voids.

We found a sizeable set of usable solutions with reentry times\nthat exceed ~40years, mainly around three specific inclination values: 46deg,\n56deg, and 68deg; a result compatible with our understanding of MEO secular\ndynamics. For DV <= 300 m/s (i.e., achieved if you start from a typical GNSS\norbit and target a disposal orbit with e<0.3), reentry times from GNSS\naltitudes exceed ~70 years, while low-cost (DV ~= 5-35 m/s) graveyard orbits,\nstable for at lest 200 years, are found for eccentricities up to e~0.018. This\ninvestigation was carried out in the framework of the EC-funded \"ReDSHIFT\"\nproject.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 12:54:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-12"}

Over the\npast decades, there has been a very active research in the development of Raman\nspectroscopy techniques for oncological applications and large scale clinical\ndiagnosis. A major issue that has received a lot of attention in the Raman\nliterature is the fact that variations in instrumental responses and intrinsic\nspectral backgrounds over different days of measurements or devices creates\nstrong inconsistency of Raman intensity spectra over the various experimental\ncondition, thus making the use of Raman spectroscopy on a large scale and\nreproductive basis difficult. We explore different methods to tackle this\ninconsistency and show that regular preprocessing methods such as baseline\ncorrection, normalization or wavelet transformation are inefficient on our\ndatasets. We find that subtracting the mean background spectrum estimated by\nidentifying non-cell regions in Raman images makes the data more consistent. As\na proof of concept, we employ our single-cell Raman Imaging protocol to\ndiagnosis challenging follicular lesions, that is known to be particularly\ndifficult due to the lack of obvious morphological and cytological criteria for\nmalignancy.

Our measurement uses the star S2 on its\n16-year orbit around the massive black hole Sgr A* that we followed\nastrometrically and spectroscopically for 27 years. Since 2017, we added\nnear-infrared interferometry with the VLTI beam combiner GRAVITY, yielding a\ndirect measurement of the separation vector between S2 and Sgr A* with an\naccuracy as good as 20 micro-arcsec in the best cases. S2 passed the pericenter\nof its highly eccentric orbit in May 2018, and we followed the passage with\ndense sampling throughout the year. Together with our spectroscopy, in the best\ncases with an error of 7 km/s, this yields a geometric distance estimate: R0 =\n8178 +- 13(stat.) +- 22(sys.) pc. This work updates our previous publication in\nwhich we reported the first detection of the gravitational redshift in the S2\ndata.

This study proposed a\npre-processing method to estimate the thermal background through iterative\ngrayscale morphologic reconstruction based on a pre-selected temperature\ncontrast. After the estimation of the background, the thermal feature of\ndelamination was kept in the residual image. A UAV-based nondestructive survey\nwas carried out on an in-service bridge for a case study and two delamination\nquantization methods (threshold-based and clustering-based) were applied on\nboth raw and residual thermal image. Results were compared and evaluated based\non the hammer sounding test on the same bridge. The performance of\ndetectability was noticeably improved while direct implementation of\npost-processing on raw image exhibited over- and under-estimation of\ndelamination. The selection of pre-defined temperature contrast and stopping\ncriterion of iteration were discussed.

We detail\nconvergence and central limit theorems for the resulting MCMC-IS estimators. We\nalso consider the case where the approximate Markov chain is pseudo-marginal,\nrequiring unbiased estimators for its approximate marginal target. Convergence\nresults with asymptotic variance formulae are shown for this case, and for the\ncase where the IS weights based on unbiased estimators are only calculated for\ndistinct output samples of the so-called `jump' chain, which, with a suitable\nreweighting, allows for improved efficiency. As the IS type weights may assume\nnegative values, extended classes of unbiased estimators may be used for the IS\ntype correction, such as those obtained from randomised multilevel Monte Carlo.\nUsing Euler approximations and coupling of particle filters, we apply the\nresulting estimator using randomised weights to the problem of parameter\ninference for partially observed It\\^{o} diffusions. Convergence of the\nestimator is verified to hold under regularity assumptions which do not require\nthat the diffusion can be simulated exactly. In the context of approximate\nBayesian computation (ABC), we suggest an adaptive MCMC approach to deal with\nthe selection of a suitably large tolerance, with IS correction possible to\nfiner tolerance, and with provided approximate confidence intervals. A\nprominent question is the efficiency of MCMC-IS compared to standard direct\nMCMC, such as pseudo-marginal, delayed acceptance, and ABC-MCMC. We provide a\ncomparison criterion which generalises the covariance ordering to the IS\nsetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 13:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-15"}

As a result,\ncloud providers are adopting the open-access Kubernetes platform as the\nstandard orchestrator of containerized applications. To ensure applications'\navailability in Kubernetes, the latter uses Raft protocol's replication\nmechanism. Despite its simplicity, Raft assumes that machines fail only when\nshutdown. This failure event is rarely the only reason for a machine's\nmalfunction. Indeed, software errors or malicious attacks can cause machines to\nexhibit Byzantine (i.e. random) behavior and thereby corrupt the accuracy and\navailability of the replication protocol.

The proposed model is illustrated on a task of determining an\nadvertising policy for a car dealership, that would increase the stock equity\nof a company. The result demonstrates the usefulness of a model for use in\ndetermining future actions of a company. We also review multiple models of the\ninfluence of outside factors on a company's total capitalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 18:23:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2019 18:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-23"}

As this might be an enabling factor in different\nforensic applications to single out possible suspects (e.g., detecting the\nauthor of child abuse or terrorist propaganda material), many accurate camera\nmodel attribution methods have been developed in the literature. One of their\nmain drawbacks, however, is the typical closed-set assumption of the problem.\nThis means that an investigated photograph is always assigned to one camera\nmodel within a set of known ones present during investigation, i.e., training\ntime, and the fact that the picture can come from a completely unrelated camera\nmodel during actual testing is usually ignored. Under realistic conditions, it\nis not possible to assume that every picture under analysis belongs to one of\nthe available camera models.

The system\nfeasibility is validated via numerical and experimental results. The inverse\nkinematics require a solution of complicated algebraic-differential equations.\nTherefore, an algorithm is developed to get an approximate solution of these\nequations. Furthermore, the motion control of this quadrotor manipulation\nsystem is quite challenging. The system has strong nonlinearities, fast\ndynamics and unstable dynamics that are very susceptible to parameters\nvariations and external disturbances. Thus, a linear Disturbance Observer\n(DOb)-based robust controller is utilized to address these issues. A modified\nDOb loop is proposed and designed to use the direct measurements. A Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) is used in the external loop of the DOb to save power\nconsumption that increases the mission time and to consider of the actuators\nconstraints. The manipulation tasks require estimating (applying) certain force\nat the end-effector.

The\ncomputation in both is parallel and non-discrete. Though the underlying\nphysical dynamics (e.g., equation of motion) may be deterministic, the observed\nor interpreted outcomes are often probabilistic. Consequently, various\ninvestigations have been undertaken to understand and reproduce the brain on\nthe basis of quantum physics and computing. However, there have been arguments\non whether the brain can and have to take advantage of quantum phenomena that\nneed to survive in the macroscopic space-time region at room temperature. This\npaper presents a unique microscopic computational model for the brain based on\nan ansatz that the brain computes in a manner similar to quantum computing, but\nwith classical waves. Log-scale encoding of information in the context of\ncomputing with waves is shown to play a critical role in bridging the computing\nmodels with classical and quantum waves. Our quantum-inspired computing model\nopens up a possibility of unifying the computing framework of artificial\nintelligence and quantum computing beyond quantum machine learning approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 01:12:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 02:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-14"}
