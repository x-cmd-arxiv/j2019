To alleviate this problem, we exploit\ngyroscope measurements, angular velocity, along with image measurement to\ncompute the relative pose between rolling shutter cameras. The gyroscope\nmeasurements provide the information about instantaneous motion that causes the\nrolling shutter distortion. Having gyroscope measurements in one hand, we\nsimplify the relative pose estimation problem and find a minimal solution for\nthe problem based on the Grobner basis polynomial solver. The proposed method\nrequires only five points to compute relative pose between rolling shutter\ncameras, whereas previous methods require 20 or 44 corresponding points for\nlinear and uniform rolling shutter geometry models, respectively. Experimental\nresults on synthetic and real data verify the superiority of the proposed\nmethod over existing relative pose estimation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Apr 2019 22:07:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

A standard practice for providing climate projections is to\nuse an ensemble of projections. The ensemble mean serves as the projection\nwhile the ensemble spread is used to estimate the associated uncertainty. The\nmain drawbacks of this approach are the fact that there is no guarantee that\nthe ensemble projections adequately sample the possible future climate\nconditions and that the quantification of the ensemble spread relies on\nassumptions that are not always justified. The relation between the true\nuncertainties associated with projections and ensemble spreads is not fully\nunderstood.

But how exactly can we rectify our\nlogical formalisms so that semantics, an endeavor that has occupied the most\npenetrating minds for over two centuries, can become (nearly) trivial, and what\nexactly does it mean to assume a theory of the world in our semantics? In this\npaper we hope to provide answers for both questions. First, we believe that a\ncommonsense theory of the world can (and should) be embedded in our semantic\nformalisms resulting in a logical semantics grounded in commonsense\nmetaphysics. Moreover, we believe the first step to accomplishing this vision\nis rectifying what we think was a crucial oversight in logical semantics,\nnamely the failure to distinguish between two fundamentally different types of\nconcepts: (i) ontological concepts, that correspond to what Cocchiarella (2001)\ncalls first-intension concepts and are types in a strongly-typed ontology; and\n(ii) logical concepts (or second intension concepts), that are predicates\ncorresponding to properties of (and relations between) objects of various\nontological types1. In such a framework, which we will refer to henceforth by\nontologik, it will be shown how type unification and other type operations can\nbe used to account for the `missing text phenomenon' (MTP) (see Saba, 2019a)\nthat is at the heart of most challenges in the semantics of natural language,\nby uncovering the significant amount of missing text that is never explicitly\nstated in everyday discourse, but is often implicitly assumed as shared\nbackground knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Apr 2019 23:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

Moreover, most of the existing supervised\ntensor learning approaches are based on the orthogonal Tucker model. However,\nthis model has some limitations for large tensors including high memory and\ncomputational costs. In this paper, we introduce a supervised learning approach\nfor tensor classification based on the tensor-train model. In particular, we\nintroduce a multi-branch tensor network structure for efficient implementation\nof tensor-train discriminant analysis (TTDA). The proposed approach takes\nadvantage of the flexibility of the tensor train structure to implement various\ncomputationally efficient versions of TTDA.

It also suggests that a\nunique pattern of the non-thermal emission variability should appear after each\nstrong flare. Taking advantage of the 13 years of observation of the HBL Mrk\n421 by the X-ray Telescope on the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory Swift-XRT, we\nprobe for such an intrinsic variability pattern.

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel approach named Multi-Channel Attention SelectionGAN (SelectionGAN) that\nmakes it possible to generate images of natural scenes in arbitrary viewpoints,\nbased on an image of the scene and a novel semantic map. The proposed\nSelectionGAN explicitly utilizes the semantic information and consists of two\nstages. In the first stage, the condition image and the target semantic map are\nfed into a cycled semantic-guided generation network to produce initial coarse\nresults. In the second stage, we refine the initial results by using a\nmulti-channel attention selection mechanism. Moreover, uncertainty maps\nautomatically learned from attentions are used to guide the pixel loss for\nbetter network optimization.

In this paper, we attempt to shed light on this\nproblem through an empirical study. We extend an approach for search-aware\ntraining via a continuous relaxation of beam search (Goyal et al., 2017b) in\norder to enable training of globally normalized recurrent sequence models\nthrough simple backpropagation.

We exploit the refocusing capability and focal symmetry constraint\nof the light field for reliable particle depth estimation. We further propose a\nnew motion-constrained optical flow estimation scheme by enforcing local motion\nrigidity and the Navier-Stoke constraint. Comprehensive experiments on\nsynthetic and real experiments show that using a single light field camera, our\ntechnique can recover dense and accurate 3D fluid flows in small to medium\nvolumes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 05:00:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 17:54:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

Multiple examples of\nfrisson-inducing sounds have been reported, but the mechanism of auditory\nfrisson remains elusive. Typical frisson-inducing sounds may contain a looming\neffect, in which a sound appears to approach the listener's peripersonal space.\nPrevious studies on sound in peripersonal space have provided objective\nmeasurements of sound-inducing effects, but few have investigated the\nsubjective experience of frisson-inducing sounds. Here we explored whether it\nis possible to produce subjective feelings of frisson by moving a noise sound\n(white noise, rolling beads noise, or frictional noise produced by rubbing a\nplastic bag) stimulus around a listener's head.

In spite of large theoretical and experimental research efforts,\nthe exact nature of the emission remains unresolved. In this work we utilize\nlayer-by-layer etching of multilayer hBN to localize the quantum emitters with\natomic precision. Our results suggest the position of the emitters correlates\nwith the fabrication method: emitters formed under plasma treatment are always\nin close proximity to the crystal surface, while emitters created under\nelectron irradiation are distributed randomly throughout the entire crystal.\nThis disparity could be traced back to the lower kinetic energy of the ions in\nthe plasma compared to the kinetic energy of the electrons in the particle\naccelerator.

Finite-difference time-domain and density\nfunctional theory simulations show that optical and electronic effects are not\nresponsible for this difference, indicating effects such as coupling to surface\ndefects or phonons might cause the reduced lifetime.

Recently it has been shown that these two\nissues can be addressed by incorporating techniques from reinforcement\nlearning, where one of the popular techniques is the advantage actor-critic\nalgorithm that calculates per-token advantage by estimating state value with a\nparametrized estimator at the cost of introducing estimation bias. In this\npaper, we estimate state value without using a parametrized value estimator.\nWith the properties of image captioning, namely, the deterministic state\ntransition function and the sparse reward, state value is equivalent to its\npreceding state-action value, and we reformulate advantage function by simply\nreplacing the former with the latter. Moreover, the reformulated advantage is\nextended to n-step, which can generally increase the absolute value of the mean\nof reformulated advantage while lowering variance. Then two kinds of rollout\nare adopted to estimate state-action value, which we call self-critical n-step\ntraining.

The principal idea of the method is to calculate the crystal field\npotential of the yttrium analogue (\"Y-analogue\") of the RE-TM magnet, i.e. the\nmaterial where the lanthanide elements have been substituted with yttrium. The\nadvantage of dealing with Y-analogues is that the methodological and conceptual\ndifficulties associated with treating the highly-localized 4f electrons in DFT\nare avoided, whilst the nominal valence electronic structure principally\nresponsible for the crystal field is preserved. In order to correctly describe\nthe crystal field potential in the core region of the atoms we use the\nprojector-augmented wave formalism of DFT, which allows the reconstruction of\nthe full charge density and electrostatic potential. The Y-analogue crystal\nfield potentials are combined with radial 4f charge densities obtained in\nself-interaction-corrected calculations on the lanthanides to obtain crystal\nfield coefficients. We demonstrate our method on a test set of 10 materials\ncomprising 9 RE-TM magnets and elemental Tb.

Data\nfreshness is captured by the {\\it age of information} (AoI) metric, defined as\nthe time elapsed since the latest update has reached the destination. The\nsource incurs an operational cost, modeled as an increasing convex function of\nthe number of updates. The destination incurs an age-related cost, modeled as\nan increasing convex function of the AoI. The source charges the destination\nfor each update and designs a pricing mechanism to maximize its profit; the\ndestination on the other hand chooses a data update schedule to minimize the\nsummation of its payments to the source and its age-related cost. The\ninteraction among the source and destination is hence game-theoretic. Motivated\nby the existing pricing literature, we first study a time-dependent pricing\nscheme, in which the price for each update depends on when it is requested. We\nshow in this case that the game equilibrium leads to only one data update,\nwhich does not yield the maximum profit to the source.

The strength of the AFM\nfluctuations is tuned by applying hydrostatic pressure to\nCeCoIn$_5(m)$/CeIn$_3(n)$ superlattices with $m$ and $n$ unit-cell-thick layers\nof CeCoIn$_5$ and CeIn$_3$, respectively.

Measurements of\nobservables in the probe system then serve as proxy measurements of observables\nin the system, under a correspondence which depends also on a preparation state\nof the probe theory. All our constructions are local and covariant, and the\nconditions may be stated abstractly in the framework of algebraic quantum field\ntheory (AQFT). The induced system observables corresponding to probe\nobservables may be localized in the causal hull of the coupling region and are\ntypically less sharp than the probe observable, but more sharp than the actual\nmeasurement on the coupled theory.

However, cosmological constraints established with galaxy cluster number\ncount are highly dependent on the calibration of the mass-observable relations.\nThanks to its nearly mass independence the specific mass accretion rate of\ngalaxy clusters is nearly insensitive to the calibration of mass-observable\nrelations. The study of galaxy cluster number count evolution allows to probe\nthe galaxy cluster mass accretion history in the context of an homogenous\nUniverse. In this paper, we use relative abundance matching to infer the galaxy\ncluster mass accretion rate (MAR) for $z \\in [0.0,0.6[$. Then, we use the MAR\nto set cosmological constraints.

It assumes the reference and deformed geometries\nto be of the Weyl type and introduces the Weyl one-form -- an additional set of\ndegrees of freedom that determine ratios of lengths in different tangent\nspaces. The Weyl one-form prevents the metric from being compatible with the\nconnection and enables exploitation of the incompatibility for characterizing\nmetrical defects in the body. When such a body undergoes temperature changes,\nadditional incompatibilities appear and interact with the defects. This\ninteraction is modeled using the Weyl transform, which keeps the Weyl\nconnection invariant whilst changing the non-metricity of the configuration. An\nimmediate consequence of the Weyl connection is that the critical points of the\nstored energy are shifted. We exploit this feature to represent the residual\nstresses. In order to relate stress and strain in our non-Euclidean setting,\nuse is made of the Doyle-Ericksen formula, which is interpreted as a relation\nbetween the intrinsic geometry of the body and the stresses developed. Thus the\nCauchy stress is conjugate to the Weyl transformed metric tensor of the\ndeformed configuration. The evolution equation for the Weyl one-form is\nconsistent with the two laws of thermodynamics. Our temperature evolution\nequation, which couples temperature, deformation and Weyl one-form, follows\nfrom the first law of thermodynamics. Using the model, the self-stress\ngenerated by a point defect is calculated and compared with the linear elastic\nsolutions. We also obtain conditions on the defect distribution (Weyl one-form)\nthat render a thermo-mechanical deformation stress-free.

Previous works, roughly speaking, indicate that for $\\lambda \\ge\n(1+\\varepsilon) e \\mu$, this EA easily optimizes the OneMax function, whereas\nan offspring population size $\\lambda \\le (1 -\\varepsilon) e \\mu$ leads to an\nexponential runtime.\n  Motivated also by the observation that in the efficient regime the\n$(\\mu,\\lambda)$ EA loses its ability to escape local optima, we take a closer\nlook into this phase transition. Among other results, we show that when $\\mu\n\\le n^{1/2 - c}$ for any constant $c > 0$, then for any $\\lambda \\le e \\mu$ we\nhave a super-polynomial runtime. However, if $\\mu \\ge n^{2/3 + c}$, then for\nany $\\lambda \\ge e \\mu$, the runtime is polynomial. For the latter result we\nobserve that the $(\\mu,\\lambda)$ EA profits from better individuals also\nbecause these, by creating slightly worse offspring, stabilize slightly\nsub-optimal sub-populations. While these first results close to the phase\ntransition do not yet give a complete picture, they indicate that the boundary\nbetween efficient and super-polynomial is not just the line $\\lambda = e \\mu$,\nand that the reasons for efficiency or not are more complex than what was known\nso far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 12:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

In these games selfish agents which\ncorrespond to nodes in a network strategically buy incident edges to improve\ntheir centrality. However, past research on these games has only considered the\ncreation of networks with unit-weight edges. In practice, e.g. when\nconstructing a fiber-optic network, the choice of which nodes to connect and\nalso the induced price for a link crucially depends on the distance between the\ninvolved nodes and such settings can be modeled via edge-weighted graphs. We\nincorporate arbitrary edge weights by generalizing the well-known model by\nFabrikant et al.[PODC'03] to edge-weighted host graphs and focus on the\ngeometric setting where the weights are induced by the distances in some metric\nspace. In stark contrast to the state-of-the-art for the unit-weight version,\nwhere the Price of Anarchy is conjectured to be constant and where resolving\nthis is a major open problem, we prove a tight non-constant bound on the Price\nof Anarchy for the metric version and a slightly weaker upper bound for the\nnon-metric case. Moreover, we analyze the existence of equilibria, the\ncomputational hardness and the game dynamics for several natural metrics. The\nmodel we propose can be seen as the game-theoretic analogue of a variant of the\nclassical Network Design Problem. Thus, low-cost equilibria of our game\ncorrespond to decentralized and stable approximations of the optimum network\ndesign.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 12:42:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 13:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-29"}

It schedules user\ntraffic among multiple CBSs by DNS resolution, with the consideration of\nload-balancing, traffic allocation consistency and scheduling granularity of\nDNS. To address these issues, we formulate the user-traffic allocation problem\nin DNS-based mobile edge caching, aiming at maximizing QoS gain and allocation\nconsistency while maintaining load balance. Then we present a simple greedy\nalgorithm which gives a more consistent solution when user-traffic changes\ndynamically. Theoretical analysis proves that it is within 3/4 of the optimal\nsolution. Extensive evaluations in numerical and trace-driven situations show\nthat the greedy algorithm can avoid about 50% unnecessary shift in user-traffic\nallocation, yield more stable cache hit ratio and balance the load between CBSs\nwithout losing much of the QoS gain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 13:11:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 09:03:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 03:58:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-17"}

Once the congestion signals are delayed,\nregulation of the load becomes more sloppy, and the queue tends to overshoot\nand undershoot more as a result, leading the data itself to experience greater\npeaks in queuing delay as well as intermittent under-utilization. Where the\nservice rate of a queue varies, it is preferable to measure the queue in units\nof time not bytes. However, the size of the queued backlog can be measured in\nbytes and signalled at the last instant as data leaves the queue, whereas\nmeasuring queuing delay introduces inherent delay. This paper proposes 'scaled\nsojourn time', which scales queuing delay by the ratio between the backlogs at\ndequeue and enqueue. This is equivalent to scaling the sojourn time by the\nratio of the arrival and departure rates averaged over the time spent in the\nqueue.

However, this requires solving the challenging problem of deciding\nwhat joint trajectories an ad-hoc group of cooperating vehicles should follow,\nwith no obvious leader known in advance. To avoid the complexities of agreeing\nwhat plan to follow in an ever-evolving situation, a protocol requiring no\nleader and no explicit inter-vehicle agreement is desirable, which nevertheless\nyields cooperative, robust behaviour. One method is demonstrated here, in\nsimulation. This uses the notion of \"desired\" versus \"planned\" trajectories,\nallowing vehicles to influence each other for mutual benefit, without requiring\na leader or explicit agreement protocol. Essentially the desired trajectory is\nthat which the vehicle would choose if other cooperating vehicles were not\npresent, avoiding the predicted paths of non-cooperating actors. The planned\ntrajectory additionally accounts for the planned trajectories of other\ncooperating vehicles, giving the safest currently available path. Both\ntrajectories are broadcast. As each vehicle attempts to (weakly) avoid the\ndesired trajectories of other vehicles, cooperative behaviour emerges. A simple\nform of model predictive control is used. The cost function penalises predicted\ncollisions, accounting for severity. There is a weak preference for maintaining\nthe current road lane, but no explicit reference trajectory. This decentralised\nplanning and simple optimisation scheme results in effective handling of a wide\nrange of collision scenarios, with no hard limit to the number of cooperating\nvehicles.

Therefore, it is necessary to predict\nsubjects' head fixations on ODIs. Inspired by generative adversarial imitation\nlearning (GAIL), this paper proposes a novel approach to predict saliency of\nhead fixations on ODIs, named SalGAIL. First, we establish a dataset for\nattention on ODIs (AOI). In contrast to traditional datasets, our AOI dataset\nis large-scale, which contains the head fixations of 30 subjects viewing 600\nODIs. Next, we mine our AOI dataset and determine three findings: (1) The\nconsistency of head fixations are consistent among subjects, and it grows\nalongside the increased subject number; (2) The head fixations exist with a\nfront center bias (FCB); and (3) The magnitude of head movement is similar\nacross subjects. According to these findings, our SalGAIL approach applies deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) to predict the head fixations of one subject, in\nwhich GAIL learns the reward of DRL, rather than the traditional human-designed\nreward. Then, multi-stream DRL is developed to yield the head fixations of\ndifferent subjects, and the saliency map of an ODI is generated via convoluting\npredicted head fixations. Finally, experiments validate the effectiveness of\nour approach in predicting saliency maps of ODIs, significantly better than 10\nstate-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 14:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

Nowadays, systems typically consist of multiple\ninteracting components and, due to their complexity, testing presents a\nconsiderable portion of the effort and cost in the design process. Exploiting\nthe compositional structure of system specifications can considerably reduce\nthe effort in model-based testing. Moreover, inferring properties about the\nsystem from testing its individual components allows the designer to reduce the\namount of integration testing.\n  In this paper, we study compositional properties of the IOCO-testing theory.\nWe propose a new approach to composition and hiding operations, inspired by\ncontract-based design and interface theories. These operations preserve\nbehaviors that are compatible under composition and hiding, and prune away\nincompatible ones.

Here, we report the observation of magnetic\nskyrmions that survive above room temperature in magnetic insulator/heavy metal\nheterostructures, i.e., thulium iron garnet/platinum. The presence of these\nskyrmions results from the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction at the interface\nand is identified by the emergent topological Hall effect. Through tuning the\nmagnetic anisotropy via varying temperature, we observe skyrmions in a large\nwindow of external magnetic field and enhanced stability of skyrmions in the\neasy-plane anisotropy regime. Our results will help create a new platform for\ninsulating skyrmion-based room temperature low dissipation spintronic\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 15:13:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-21"}

While the electron neutrino appearance and\ndisappearance data are in favor of such a sterile neutrino, the muon\ndisappearance data disfavor it, which gives rise to a strong\nappearance-disappearacne tension.

LaB6 is among the most effective\nelectron-beam sources with one of the highest brightness of thermionic\nemission. A deep understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for the\nextraordinary properties of LaB6 is required in order to optimize the\nparameters and design of thermionic elements for application in various\nelectron-beam devices. Motivated by recent experiments on rare earth borides\nindicating a strong coupling of conduction electrons to the crystal lattice and\nrare earth ions, we have studied the state of electrons in the conduction band\nof lanthanum hexaboride by performing infrared spectroscopic, DC resistivity\nand Hall-effect studies of LaB6 single crystals with different ratios of 10B\nand 11B isotopes. We find that only a small amount of electrons in the\nconduction band behave as Drude-type mobile charge carriers while up to 70% of\nthe electrons are far out of equilibrium and involved in collective\noscillations of electron density coupled to vibrations of the Jahn-Teller\nunstable rigid boron cage and rattling modes of La-ions that are loosely bound\nto the lattice. We argue that exactly these non-equilibrium (hot) electrons in\nthe conduction band determine the extraordinary low work function of\nthermoemission in LaB6. Our observation may guide future search for compounds\nwith possibly lower electron work function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 15:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

As a consequence, the predictions of our model, such as the\nshadow shape and size, depend on one free parameter determining the curvature\nscale at which deviations from General Relativity set in. In more general\nnew-physics settings, it can also depart substantially from the Planck scale.\nIn this case, the free parameter is constrained by observations, since the\ncorresponding curvature scale is significantly below the Planck-scale. The\nleading new-physics effect can be recast as a scale-dependent black-hole mass,\nresulting in distinct observational signatures of our model. As a concrete\nexample, we show that two mass-measurements, extracted from the size of the\nshadow and from Keplerian orbital motion of stars, allow to distinguish the\nclassical from the modified, regular black-hole spacetime, yielding a bound on\nthe free parameter. For spinning black holes, we further find that the\nsingularity-resolving new physics puts a characteristic dent in the shadow.\nFinally, we argue, based on the underlying physical mechanism, that the effects\nwe derive could be generic consequences of a large class of quantum-gravity\ntheories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 15:37:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 03:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

Surveillance through computer vision\nand expert decision making systems can help to understand the crowd phenomena\nat large gatherings. Understanding crowd phenomena can be helpful in early\nidentification of unwanted incidents and their prevention. Motion flow is one\nof the important crowd phenomena that can be instrumental in describing the\ncrowd behavior. Flows can be useful in understanding instabilities in the\ncrowd. However, extracting motion flows is a challenging task due to randomness\nin crowd movement and limitations of the sensing device. Moreover, low-level\nfeatures such as optical flow can be misleading if the randomness is high. In\nthis paper, we propose a new model based on Langevin equation to analyze the\nlinear dominant flows in videos of densely crowded scenarios. We assume a force\nmodel with three components, namely external force, confinement/drift force,\nand disturbance force. These forces are found to be sufficient to describe the\nlinear or near-linear motion in dense crowd videos. The method is significantly\nfaster as compared to existing popular crowd segmentation methods. The\nevaluation of the proposed model has been carried out on publicly available\ndatasets as well as using our dataset. It has been observed that the proposed\nmethod is able to estimate and segment the linear flows in the dense crowd with\nbetter accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art techniques with substantial\ndecrease in the computational overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 09:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

Recent developments have seen\nthe workflow satisfiability problem (WSP) studied in the context of workflow\nspecifications in which the set of steps may vary from one instance of the\nworkflow to another. This, in turn, means that some constraints may only apply\nto certain workflow instances. Inevitably, WSP becomes more complex for such\nworkflow specifications. Other approaches have considered the possibility of\nassociating costs with the violation of `soft' constraints and authorizations.\nWorkflow satisfiability in this context becomes a question of minimizing the\ncost of allocating users to steps in the workflow. In this paper, we introduce\nnew problems, which we believe to be of practical relevance, that combine these\napproaches. In particular, we consider the question of whether, given a\nworkflow specification with costs and a `budget', all possible workflow\ninstances have an allocation of users to steps that does not exceed the budget.\nWe design a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm to solve this problem\nparameterized by the total number of steps, release points and xor branchings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 10:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

To enable more structured\ncomparisons, we describe three continual learning scenarios based on whether at\ntest time task identity is provided and--in case it is not--whether it must be\ninferred. Any sequence of well-defined tasks can be performed according to each\nscenario.

While ranking or selecting patterns is well-studied for\nitemsets it is surprisingly under-researched for other, more complex, pattern\ntypes.\n  In this paper we propose a new quality measure for episodes. An episode is\nessentially a set of events with possible restrictions on the order of events.\nWe say that an episode is significant if its occurrence is abnormally compact,\nthat is, only few gap events occur between the actual episode events, when\ncompared to the expected length according to the independence model. We can\napply this measure as a post-pruning step by first discovering frequent\nepisodes and then rank them according to this measure.\n  In order to compute the score we will need to compute the mean and the\nvariance according to the independence model. As a main technical contribution\nwe introduce a technique that allows us to compute these values. Such a task is\nsurprisingly complex and in order to solve it we develop intricate finite state\nmachines that allow us to compute the needed statistics. We also show that\nasymptotically our score can be interpreted as a P-value. In our experiments we\ndemonstrate that despite its intricacy our ranking is fast: we can rank tens of\nthousands episodes in seconds. Our experiments with text data demonstrate that\nour measure ranks interpretable episodes high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 01:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-18"}

This is motivated by a metric which\nallows the existence of sub-Planckian black holes, where the black hole mass\n$m$ is replaced by\n$M=m\\Big(1+\\frac{\\beta^{2}}{2}\\frac{M_{pl}^{2}}{m^{2}}-\\beta\\frac{M_{pl}}{m}\\Big)$.\nConsidering a wave-packet with a Gaussian profile, we evaluate the HWF and the\nprobability that the source might be a (quantum) black hole. By decreasing the\nfree parameter the general form of probability distribution,\n${\\mathcal{P}}_{BH}$, is preserved , but this resulted in reducing the\nprobability for the particle to be a black hole accordingly. The probability\nfor the particle to be a black hole grows when the mass is increasing slowly\nfor larger positive $\\beta$, and for a minimum mass value it reaches to $0$. In\neffect, for larger $\\beta$ the magnitude of $M$ and $r_{H}$ increases, matching\nwith our intuition that either the particle ought to be more localized or more\nmassive to be a black hole. The scenario undergoes a change for some values of\n$\\beta$ significantly, where there is a minimum in ${\\mathcal{P}}_{BH}$ , so\nthis expresses that every particle can have some probability of decaying to a\nblack hole. In addition, for sufficiently large $\\beta$ we find that every\nparticle could be fundamentally a quantum black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 06:48:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

In\neach patch of the network two species are assumed to interact following a\nnon-normal reaction scheme.

The\nsame phenomenon holds when the system is bound to explore a quasi degenerate\nnetwork. In this case, the eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator, which governs\nspecies diffusion, accumulate over a limited portion of the complex plane. The\nlarger the network, the more pronounced the amplification. Beyond a critical\nnetwork size, a system deemed deterministically stable, hence resilient, may\nturn unstable, yielding seemingly regular patterns in the concentration amount.\nNon-normality and quasi-degenerate networks may therefore amplify the inherent\nstochasticity, and so contribute to altering the perception of resilience, as\nquantified via conventional deterministic methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Apr 2019 16:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}
