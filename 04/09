In order to find out\nthe properties of interacting dark energy models, it is necessary to\ninvestigate the cosmological perturbations in detail. However, due to the\nimproper use of pressure perturbation of dark energy, a large-scale instability\nat the early stage occurs occasionally. In recent years, parametrized\npost-Friedmann approach has been used to calculate the perturbation equations\nin the interacting dark energy scenario. Under this framework, the dark energy\npressure perturbation was replaced by the relationship between the momentum\ndensity of dark energy and other components on a large scale. However, this\npaper shows that if the interaction terms are related to the velocity\nperturbation of dark energy, the density perturbation of dark matter and the\nmatter power spectrum will diverge when the equation of state parameter of dark\nenergy $w$ is close to $-1$.

Taking the example\nof two different deep (3 hidden layers) classifiers for MNIST data, we find\nquite different $T$ values to be appropriate in each case. In particular, for a\ntypical neural network classifier a clear minimum of the test error is observed\nat $T>0$.

When a new wave of longitudinal data arrives, we can treat the combined\ndata of multiple waves as a new missing data problem and overwrite existing\nimputations with new values (re-imputation). Alternatively, we may keep the\nexisting imputations, and impute only the new data.

Some policies can result in low frequencies of a\nparticular chunk, known as the missing chunk syndrome, which can dramatically\nreduce throughput and lead to instability of the system. For instance, commonly\nused policies that nominally \"boost\" the sharing of infrequent chunks such as\nthe well known rarest-first algorithm have been shown to be unstable. Recent\nefforts have largely focused on the careful design of boosting policies to\nmitigate this issue. We take a complementary viewpoint, and instead consider a\npolicy that simply prevents the sharing of the most frequent chunk(s).\nFollowing terminology from statistics wherein the most frequent value in a data\nset is called the mode, we refer to this policy as mode-suppression. We also\nconsider a more general version that suppresses the mode only if the mode\nfrequency is larger than the lowest frequency by a fixed threshold. We prove\nthe stability of mode-suppression using Lyapunov techniques, and use a Kingman\nbound argument to show that the total download time does not increase with peer\narrival rate. We then design versions of mode-suppression that sample a small\nnumber of peers at each time, and construct noisy mode estimates by aggregating\nthese samples over time. We show numerically that the variants of\nmode-suppression yield near-optimal download times, and outperform all other\nrecently proposed chunk sharing algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 17:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

This equation includes the\nelementary processes of random motion, reproduction and, importantly, nonlocal\ninterspecific competition, which introduces a spatial scale of interaction.\nFurthermore, we take into account feedback mechanisms in diffusion and growth\nprocesses, mimicked through density-dependencies controlled by exponents $\\nu$\nand $\\mu$, respectively. These feedbacks include, for instance, anomalous\ndiffusion, reaction to overcrowding or to rarefaction of the population, as\nwell as Allee-like effects. We report that, depending on the dynamics in place,\nthe population can self-organize splitting into disconnected sub-populations,\nin the absence of environment constraints. Through extensive numerical\nsimulations, we investigate the temporal evolution and stationary features of\nthe population distribution in the one-dimensional case. We discuss the crucial\nrole that density-dependency has on pattern formation, particularly on\nfragmentation, which can bring important consequences to processes such as\nepidemic spread and speciation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 17:16:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-03"}

The free maps are supposed to satisfy\ncertain axioms, among them closure under tensor products, under composition and\nfreeness of the identity map (the latter two say that the free maps form a\nmonoid). The free maps act on the resources simply by tensor product and\ncomposition. This generalizes the much-studied resource theories of quantum\nstates, and abolishes the distinction between resources (states) and the free\nmaps, which act on the former, leaving only maps, divided into resource-full\nand resource-free ones.\n  We discuss the axiomatic framework of quantifying channel resources, and show\ntwo general methods of constructing resource monotones of channels.\nFurthermore, we show that under mild regularity conditions, each resource\ntheory of quantum channels has a distinguished monotone, the robustness (and\nits smoothed version), generalizing the analogous concept in resource theories\nof states. We give an operational interpretation of the log-robustness as the\namount of heat dissipation (randomness) required for resource erasure by random\nreversible free maps, valid in broad classes of resource theories of quantum\nchannels. Technically, this is based on an abstract version of the recent\nconvex-split lemma, extended from its original domain of quantum states to\nordered vector spaces with sufficiently well-behaved base norms (which includes\nthe case of quantum channels with diamond norm or variants thereof).

Most importantly,\nwe find that the dynamical component of the ejected mass can be strongly\nsuppressed in the case of high spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum.\nIn this case, in fact, the merger remnant has an excess angular momentum\nyielding a more extended and \"colder\" object, with reduced ability to shed mass\ndynamically. We discuss how this result impacts the analysis of the recent\nmerger event GW170817 and its kilonova afterglow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 17:43:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 04:35:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

BWT is one of the most heavily studied\nalgorithms in data compression with numerous applications in indexing, sequence\nanalysis, and bioinformatics. Its construction is a bottleneck in many\nscenarios, and settling the complexity of this task is one of the most\nimportant unsolved problems in sequence analysis that has remained open for 25\nyears. Given a binary string of length $n$, occupying $O(n/\\log n)$ machine\nwords, the BWT construction algorithm due to Hon et al. (SIAM J. Comput., 2009)\nruns in $O(n)$ time and $O(n/\\log n)$ space.

The\nexistence of this state is a prediction of the color glass condensate (CGC)\neffective theory. In many applications of the CGC framework, the boost\ninvariant approximation is employed. It assumes that the longitudinal extent of\nthe nuclei can be approximated as infinitesimally thin. Consequently, the\nGlasma produced from such a collision is boost invariant and can be effectively\ndescribed in 2+1D. Therefore, observables of the boost invariant Glasma are by\nconstruction independent of rapidity.\n  The main goal of this thesis is to develop a numerical method for the\nnon-boost-invariant setting where nuclei are assumed to be thin, but of finite\nlongitudinal extent. This is in conflict with a number of simplifications that\nare used in the boost invariant case. In particular, one has to describe the\ncollisions in 3+1D in the laboratory or center-of-mass frame. The change of\nframe forces the explicit inclusion of the color charges of nuclei. The new\nmethod is tested using an extension of the McLerran-Venugopalan model which\nincludes a parameter for longitudinal thickness. It reproduces the boost\ninvariant setting as a limiting case. Studying the pressure components of the\nGlasma, one finds the pressure anisotropy remains large. The energy density of\nthe Glasma depends on rapidity due to the explicit breaking of boost\ninvariance. The width of the observed rapidity profiles is controlled by the\ncollision energy and can be shown to roughly agree with experimental data.\nFinally, a new numerical scheme for real-time lattice gauge theory is developed\nwhich provides higher numerical stability than the previous method.

Since such additional traffic may\nlead to an unexpected behavior of devices, active scanning methods should be\navoided in critical infrastructure networks.

A set of operations are commutative if changing\nthe order of their execution on an object does not affect the abstract state of\nthe object and returns the same response. Concurrent operations that commute at\nobject-level can be executed concurrently at transaction-level, which boosts\nperformance while preserving the appearance of atomicity and isolation.\nUtilizing object-level commutativity in transactional execution enables the\nreuse of existing non-blocking programming techniques for thread-level\nsynchronization. In our approach, we generate state-chart graphs by tracking\ndata on the atomic instructions invoked on the concurrent object during model\nchecking and represent the atomic instructions as states in a state-transition\nrepresentation. Considering the non-deterministic nature of concurrent\nprograms, we determine commutativity by exhaustively searching for identical\nobject states captured at a thread-level granularity across all thread\ninterleavings. With this methodology, a user can not only verify commutativity\namong operations, but also can visually check ways in which methods commute at\nobject-level, which is an edge over current state-of-the-art tools.

The density discontinuity travels upstream and drivers caught in\nthe shockwave experience transitions from free to congested traffic. Boundary\ncontrol design in this paper brings the moving shockwave front to a static\nsetpoint position, hindering the upstream propagation of traffic congestion.\nThe traffic dynamics are described with Lighthill-Whitham-Richard (LWR) model,\nleading to a system of two first-order hyperbolic partial differential\nequations (PDEs).

Traffic on a freeway segment with capacity drop at outlet of the\nsegment is a common phenomenon leading to traffic bottleneck problem. The\ncapacity drop can be caused by lane-drop, hills, tunnel, bridge or curvature on\nthe road. If incoming traffic flow remains unchanged, traffic congestion forms\nupstream of the bottleneck due to outgoing traffic overflowing its capacity.\nTherefore, it is important for us to regulate the incoming traffic flow of the\nsegment so that the outgoing traffic at the bottleneck can be discharged with\nthe maximum flow rate. Traffic densities on the freeway segment are described\nwith Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) macroscopic Partial Differential Equation\n(PDE) model. To prevent the traffic congestion forming upstream of the\nbottleneck, incoming flow at the inlet of the freeway segment is controlled so\nthat the optimal density could be achieved to maximize the outgoing flow and\nnot to surpass the capacity at outlet. The density and traffic flow relation,\ndescribed with fundamental diagram, is assumed to be unknown at the bottleneck\narea. We tackle this problem using Extremum Seeking (ES) Control with delay\ncompensation for LWR PDE. ES control, a non-model based approach for real-time\noptimization, is adopted to find the optimal density for the unknown\nfundamental diagram. A predictor feedback control design is proposed to\ncompensate the delay effect of traffic dynamics in the freeway segment. In the\nend, simulation results validate a desired performance of the controller on the\nnonlinear LWR model with an unknown fundamental diagram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 19:31:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

The band gaps obtained from mBJ are 0.81 eV,\n0.69 eV and 0.60 eV for Fe$_{2}$ScX compounds, respectively. The phonon\ndispersion, phonon density of states (DOS) and partial DOS are calculated. The\nphonon contributions to specific heat are obtained as a function of temperature\nunder harmonic approximation. The electronic band structutre calculated from\nmBJ and SCAN functionals are qualitatively compared. The TE parameters are\ncalculated for both hole and electron dopings under semiclassical theory.

Using the specific heat, estimated $\\tau_{ph}$ and slopes (phase\nvelocity) of acoustic branches in the linear region, lattice thermal\nconductivity ($\\kappa_{ph}$) at 300 K is calculated for three compounds. The\nobtained values of $\\kappa_{ph}$ with constant $\\tau_{ph}$ are 18.2, 13.6 and\n10.3 $Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$, respectively. Finally, the temperature dependent figure\nof merit $ZT$ values are calculated for optimal carrier concentrations in the\ndoping range considered, to evaluate the materials for TE application. The $ZT$\nvalues for n-type Fe$_{2}$ScX, in 900-1200 K, are 0.34-0.43, 0.40-0.48 and\n0.45-0.52, respectively.

For correct expansion of organs that primarily\ngrow by elongating, such as roots and stems, MTs must bend in the\nhigh-curvature direction along the cylindrically shaped cell membrane in order\nto form the required circumferential arrays. Computational studies, which have\nrecapitulated the self-organization of these arrays, ignored MT mechanics and\nassumed MTs follow geodesics of the cell surface. Here, we show, through\nanalysis of a derived Euler-Lagrange equation, that an elastic MT constrained\nto a cylindrical surface will deflect away from geodesics and toward low\ncurvature directions to minimize bending energy. This occurs when the curvature\nof the cell surface is relatively high for a given anchor density. In the limit\nof infinite anchor density, MTs always follow geodesics. We compare our\nanalytical predictions to measured curvatures and anchor densities and find\nthat the regime in which cells are forming these cortical arrays straddles the\nregion of parameter space in which arrays must form under the antagonistic\ninfluence of this mechanically induced deflection. Although this introduces a\npotential obstacle to forming circumferentially orientated arrays that needs to\nbe accounted for in the models, it also raises the question of whether plants\nuse this mechanical phenomenon to regulate array orientation.

Towards this, we propose a new simple\nyet efficient deep network architecture, called \\textit{relational reasoning\nnetwork (RRN)}, to accurately learn the local and the global relations among\nthe landmarks in CMF bones; specifically, mandible, maxilla, and nasal bones.\n  Approach: The proposed RRN works in an end-to-end manner, utilizing learned\nrelations of the landmarks based on dense-block units. For a given few\nlandmarks as input, RRN treats the landmarking process similar to a data\nimputation problem where predicted landmarks are considered missing.\n  Results: We applied RRN to cone beam computed tomography scans obtained from\n250 patients. With a 4-fold cross validation technique, we obtained an average\nroot mean squared error of less than 2 mm per landmark.

The\nproposed system identifies the missing landmark locations accurately even when\nsevere pathology or deformation are present in the bones.\n  Conclusions: Accurately identifying anatomical landmarks is a crucial step in\ndeformation analysis and surgical planning for CMF surgeries. Achieving this\ngoal without the need for explicit bone segmentation addresses a major\nlimitation of segmentation based approaches, where segmentation failure (as\noften the case in bones with severe pathology or deformation) could easily lead\nto incorrect landmarking.

The oscillation\npattern and the structure of the pointer-states can give us information on the\ncharacteristics of the DM and the kind of interaction that has taken place.\nFrom this perspective, neutrinos can be viewed as DM-tracers. We study the\nlocal evolution of neutrino flavor-eigenstates due to local effects produced by\nthe presence of DM. To explore the sensitivity of the model, we consider\ndifferent DM density profiles, masses and interactions. Starting from the\neigenstates of the neutrino-mass Hamiltonian, we construct the flavor-states\nwith the neutrino mixing-matrix in vacuum. We then include local interactions\nwith DM, acting along the neutrino path towards the Earth, and analyse the\nresulting probabilities. In doing so, we adopt different DM density profiles,\ne.g. a constant, a local isotropic and a Navarro-Frenk-White density\ndistribution. Finally, by following the time evolution of the flavor-states, we\nidentify pointer-states and interpret the results in terms of the adopted DM\nmodel. Due to the interaction with DM, neutrinos experience the MSW effect, the\nextent of which depends on the DM density profile. The interaction with DM\nproduces the enhancement or suppression of oscillations. Decoherence effects\nmay take place. We model the time evolution of extragalactic neutrino\nflavor-states by letting them interact with DM.

Full vector sensing\ncapability is proffered by modulating fields along the preferential NV axis and\nin the transverse plane and subsequent demodulation of the signal. This sensor\nexhibits a root mean square noise floor of about 300 pT/Hz^(1/2) in all\ndirections.

As a source of inspiration, insects\nare quite apt at searching for mates and tracking prey -- which always appear\nas small dim speckles in the visual field. The exquisite sensitivity of insects\nfor small target motion, as revealed recently, is coming from a class of\nspecific neurons called small target motion detectors (STMDs).

To address\nthis problem, this paper proposes a novel visual system model (STMD+) for small\ntarget motion detection, which is composed of four subsystems -- ommatidia,\nmotion pathway, contrast pathway and mushroom body. Compared to existing\nSTMD-based models, the additional contrast pathway extracts directional\ncontrast from luminance signals to eliminate false positive background motion.\nThe directional contrast and the extracted motion information by the motion\npathway are integrated in the mushroom body for small target discrimination.\nExtensive experiments showed the significant and consistent improvements of the\nproposed visual system model over existing STMD-based models against fake\nfeatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 21:21:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

The current system has major issues in the higher\neducation at Salahaddin University-Erbil (SUE) in Kurdistan-Iraq. These issues\nare: first, the assessment of lecturers' activities is conducted traditionally\nvia the Quality Assurance Teams at different departments and colleges at the\nuniversity, second, the outcomes in some cases of lecturers' performance\nprovoke a low level of acceptance among lectures, as these cases are reflected\nand viewed by some academic communities as unfair cases, and finally, the\ncurrent system is not accurate and vigorous.

One set\nmay therefore be within another, not as an element, but as an element of an\nelement, or even deeper, inside several layers of sets within sets. The\nintroduction of the term constituent to describe a set which is within a given\nset, however deep, induces an apparently novel partial order on sets, and\nassigns to any given set a diagram which specifies a directed graph, or\ncategory, herein dubbed its constituent structure, indicating which sets within\nit are constituents of which others.

Given a graph, we can often order vertices\nin a way that neighboring vertices have a higher probability of being connected\nto each other. This implies that the edges form a band around the diagonal in\nthe adjacency matrix. Such structure may rise for example if the graph was\ncreated over time: each vertex had an active time interval during which the\nvertex was connected with other active vertices.\n  The goal of this paper is to model this phenomenon. To this end, we formulate\nan optimization problem: given a graph and an integer $K$, we want to order\ngraph vertices and partition the ordered adjacency matrix into $K$ bands such\nthat bands closer to the diagonal are more dense. We measure the goodness of a\nsegmentation using the log-likelihood of a log-linear model, a flexible family\nof distributions containing many standard distributions. We divide the problem\ninto two subproblems: finding the order and finding the bands. We show that\ndiscovering bands can be done in polynomial time with isotonic regression, and\nwe also introduce a heuristic iterative approach. For discovering the order we\nuse Fiedler order accompanied with a simple combinatorial refinement. We\ndemonstrate empirically that our heuristic works well in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 00:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

The\nAugment-Reinforce-Merge (ARM), a recently proposed unbiased gradient estimator,\nis investigated for this binary optimization problem. Compared to the hard\nconcrete gradient estimator from Louizos et al., ARM demonstrates superior\nperformance of pruning network architectures while retaining almost the same\naccuracies of baseline methods. Similar to the hard concrete estimator, ARM\nalso enables conditional computation during model training but with improved\neffectiveness due to the exact binary stochasticity. Thanks to the flexibility\nof ARM, many smooth or non-smooth parametric functions, such as scaled sigmoid\nor hard sigmoid, can be used to parameterize this binary optimization problem\nand the unbiasness of the ARM estimator is retained, while the hard concrete\nestimator has to rely on the hard sigmoid function to achieve conditional\ncomputation and thus accelerated training.

However, in many real-world cases, data is often of low-quality due to\na variety of reasons, such as data consistency, integrity, completeness,\naccuracy, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, attention based\nmulti-instance neural network (AMI-Net), to make the single disease\nclassification only based on the existing and valid information in the\nreal-world outpatient records.

While recent studies have shown\nimpressive progress in 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) based facial reconstruction,\nthe settings are mostly restricted to a single view. There is an inherent\ndrawback in the single-view setting: the lack of reliable 3D constraints can\ncause unresolvable ambiguities. We in this paper explore 3DMM-based shape\nrecovery in a different setting, where a set of multi-view facial images are\ngiven as input. A novel approach is proposed to regress 3DMM parameters from\nmulti-view inputs with an end-to-end trainable Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN).

Through minimizing the view alignment loss, better 3D shapes\ncan be recovered such that the synthetic projections from one view to another\ncan better align with the observed image.

When compared to a\ndeterministic model, a stochastic model represents `model uncertainty', i.e.,\nsources of error in the forecast due to the limitations of the forecast model.\nWe present a technique for systematically deriving new stochastic\nparametrisations or for constraining existing stochastic approaches. A\nhigh-resolution model simulation is coarse-grained to the desired forecast\nmodel resolution. This provides the initial conditions and forcing data needed\nto drive a Single Column Model (SCM). By comparing the SCM parametrised\ntendencies with the evolution of the high resolution model, we can estimate the\nerror in the SCM tendencies that a stochastic parametrisation seeks to\nrepresent. We use this approach to assess the physical basis of the widely used\nStochastically Perturbed Parametrisation Tendencies (SPPT) scheme. We find\njustification for the multiplicative nature of SPPT, and for the use of\nspatio-temporally correlated stochastic perturbations. We find evidence that\nthe stochastic perturbation should be positively skewed, indicating that\noccasional large-magnitude positive perturbations are physically realistic.\nHowever other key assumptions of SPPT are less well justified, including\ncoherency of the stochastic perturbations with height, coherency of the\nperturbations for different physical parametrisation schemes, and coherency for\ndifferent prognostic variables. Relaxing these SPPT assumptions allows for an\nerror model that explains a larger fractional variance than traditional SPPT.\nIn particular, we suggest that independently perturbing the tendencies\nassociated with different parametrisation schemes is justifiable, and would\nimprove the realism of the SPPT approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 07:44:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

This paper\nconsiders the labeled tree indexing problem, and provides a number of new\nresults on space bound analysis, and on algorithms for efficient construction\nand pattern matching queries. Kosaraju [FOCS 1989] was the first to consider\nthe labeled tree indexing problem, and he proposed the suffix tree for a\nbackward trie, where the strings in the trie are read in the leaf-to-root\ndirection. In contrast to a backward trie, we call a usual trie as a forward\ntrie. Despite a few follow-up works after Kosaraju's paper, indexing\nforward/backward tries is not well understood yet. In this paper, we show a\nfull perspective on the sizes of indexing structures such as suffix trees,\nDAWGs, CDAWGs, suffix arrays, affix trees, affix arrays for forward and\nbackward tries. Some of them take $O(n)$ space in the size $n$ of the input\ntrie, while the others can occupy $O(n^2)$ space in the worst case. In\nparticular, we show that the size of the DAWG for a forward trie with $n$ nodes\nis $\\Omega(\\sigma n)$, where $\\sigma$ is the number of distinct characters in\nthe trie. This becomes $\\Omega(n^2)$ for an alphabet of size $\\sigma =\n\\Theta(n)$.

This compact representation allows for\nsimulating each DAWG edge traversal in $O(\\log \\sigma)$ time, and can be\nconstructed in $O(n)$ time and space over any integer alphabet of size $O(n)$.\nIn addition, this readily extends to the first indexing structure that permits\nbidirectional pattern searches over a trie within linear space in the input\ntrie size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 08:05:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 13:18:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 10:26:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 06:46:51 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 08:27:29 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2022 09:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

In particular, it is hard to\nsimultaneously record all the neurons of the same type in a given area. Recent\nprogress have made possible to profile each recorded neuron in a given area\nthanks to genetic and physiological tools, and to pool together recordings from\nneurons of the same type across different experimental sessions. However, it is\nunclear how to infer the activity of a full population of neurons of the same\ntype from these sequential recordings. Neural networks exhibit collective\nbehaviour, e.g. noise correlations and synchronous activity, that are not\ndirectly captured by a conditionally-independent model that would just put\ntogether the spike trains from sequential recordings. Here we show that we can\ninfer the activity of a full population of retina ganglion cells from\nsequential recordings, using a novel method based on copula distributions and\nmaximum entropy modeling. From just the spiking response of each ganglion cell\nto a repeated stimulus, and a few pairwise recordings, we could predict the\nnoise correlations using copulas, and then the full activity of a large\npopulation of ganglion cells of the same type using maximum entropy modeling.\nRemarkably, we could generalize to predict the population responses to\ndifferent stimuli and even to different experiments. We could therefore use our\nmethod to construct a very large population merging cells' responses from\ndifferent experiments. We predicted synchronous activity accurately and showed\nit grew substantially with the number of neurons. This approach is a promising\nway to infer population activity from sequential recordings in sensory areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 08:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

This makes hyperspectral imaging an\nimportant tool for earth sciences, land-cover studies, and military and\nstrategic applications. However, the scarcity of labeled training examples and\nspatial variability of spectral signature are two of the biggest challenges\nfaced by hyperspectral image classification. In order to address these issues,\nwe aim to develop a framework for material-agnostic information retrieval in\nhyperspectral images based on Positive-Unlabelled (PU) classification. Given a\nhyperspectral scene, the user labels some positive samples of a material he/she\nis looking for and our goal is to retrieve all the remaining instances of the\nquery material in the scene.

This material-agnostic nature of the\nframework provides it with superior generalization abilities. We explore two\nalternative approaches to solve the hyperspectral image classification problem\nwithin this framework. The first approach is an adaptation of non-negative risk\nestimation based PU learning for hyperspectral data.

A natural\nquestion arises can we reduce that memory requirement whilst maintaining\nperformance. In particular, in this work we address the problem of memory\nefficient learning for multiple tasks. To this end, we propose a novel network\narchitecture producing multiple networks of different configurations, termed\ndeep virtual networks (DVNs), for different tasks. Each DVN is specialized for\na single task and structured hierarchically. The hierarchical structure, which\ncontains multiple levels of hierarchy corresponding to different numbers of\nparameters, enables multiple inference for different memory budgets. The\nbuilding block of a deep virtual network is based on a disjoint collection of\nparameters of a network, which we call a unit. The lowest level of hierarchy in\na deep virtual network is a unit, and higher levels of hierarchy contain lower\nlevels' units and other additional units. Given a budget on the number of\nparameters, a different level of a deep virtual network can be chosen to\nperform the task. A unit can be shared by different DVNs, allowing multiple\nDVNs in a single network. In addition, shared units provide assistance to the\ntarget task with additional knowledge learned from another tasks. This\ncooperative configuration of DVNs makes it possible to handle different tasks\nin a memory-aware manner. Our experiments show that the proposed method\noutperforms existing approaches for multiple tasks. Notably, ours is more\nefficient than others as it allows memory-aware inference for all tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 09:34:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

There are two indicators of extinction: the color\nexcess ratio (CER) and the relative extinction. Compared to the CER, the\nwavelength-dependent relative extinction is more challenging to be determined.\nIn this work, we combine spectroscopic, astrometric, and photometric data to\nderive high-precision CERs and relative extinction from optical to mid-infrared\n(IR) bands. A group of 61,111 red clump (RC) stars are selected as tracers by\nstellar parameters from APOGEE survey. The multiband photometric data are\ncollected from Gaia, APASS, SDSS, Pan-STARRS1, 2MASS, and WISE surveys. For the\nfirst time, we calibrate the curvature of CERs in determining CERs\nE(lambda-GRP)/E(GBP-GRP) from color excess--color excess diagrams. Through\nelaborate uncertainty analysis, we conclude that the precision of our CERs is\nsignificantly improved (sigma < 0.015). With parallaxes from Gaia DR2, we\ncalculate the relative extinction A_GBP/A_GRP for 5051 RC stars. By combining\nthe CERs with the A_GBP/A_GRP, the optical--mid-IR extinction A_lambda/A_GRP\nhas been determined in a total of 21 bands. Given no bias toward any specific\nenvironment, our extinction law represents the average extinction law with the\ntotal-to-selective extinction ratio Rv=3.16+-0.15. Our observed extinction law\nsupports an adjustment in parameters of the CCM Rv=3.1 curve, together with the\nnear-IR power-law index alpha=2.07+-0.03. The relative extinction values of HST\nand JWST near-IR bandpasses are predicted in 2.5% precision. As the observed\nreddening/extinction tracks are curved, the curvature correction needs to be\nconsidered when applying extinction correction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 10:12:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 08:26:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 09:09:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

The\nquestions whether strong coupling can be achieved with a single molecule only\nand how this is unambiguously proven are still under debate. A critical issue\nof plasmonic in contrast to photonic systems is additional excitonic line\nbroadening, which is often neglected when modeling such systems. This has led\nto too optimistic design predictions or incorrect interpretation of ambiguous\nexperimental data, for example in models relying on Maxwell solvers without\nself-consistent incorporation of line broadening effects.

A false positive (FP) from a\nfalse localization during autonomous driving can lead to fatal accidents and\nhinder safe and efficient driving. Therefore, a detection algorithm that can\ncope with mislocalizations is required in autonomous driving applications. This\npaper proposes a method for improving the detection accuracy while supporting a\nreal-time operation by modeling the bounding box (bbox) of YOLOv3, which is the\nmost representative of one-stage detectors, with a Gaussian parameter and\nredesigning the loss function. In addition, this paper proposes a method for\npredicting the localization uncertainty that indicates the reliability of bbox.\nBy using the predicted localization uncertainty during the detection process,\nthe proposed schemes can significantly reduce the FP and increase the true\npositive (TP), thereby improving the accuracy.

EEG recordings are frequently contaminated by muscle artifacts,\nwhich obscure and complicate their interpretation. These muscle artifacts are\nparticularly difficult to be removed from the EEG in order the latter to be\nused for further clinical evaluation. In this paper, we proposed a new approach\nin removing muscle artifacts from EEG data using a method that combines second\nand high order statistical information. Subjects and Methods: In the proposed\nsystem the muscle artifacts of the EEG signal are removed by using the\nIndependent Vector Analysis (IVA). The latter was formulated as a general joint\nBlind Source Separation (BSS) method that uses both second-order and higher\norder statistical information and thus takes advantage of both Independent\nComponent Analysis (ICA) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA).\nDiagonalization methods for IVA in the proposed system were reworked based on\nSCHUR decomposition offering a faster second order blind identification\nalgorithm that can be used on time demanding applications. Results: The\nproposed method is evaluated in both simulated and real EEG data. To\nquantitatively examine the performance of the new method, two objective\nmeasures were adopted. The first measure is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)\nwhile the second is the Signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR).

However, both classical and relativistic processes can\nlead to a small non-zero charge of black holes. When dealing with neutral\nparticles and photons, zero charge is a good approximation. On the other hand,\neven a small charge can significantly influence the motion of charged\nparticles, in particular cosmic rays, in the vicinity of black holes.\nTherefore, we stress that more attention should be paid to the problem of a\nblack-hole charge and hence, it should not be neglected a priori, as it is done\nin most astrophysical studies nowadays. The paper looks at the problem of the\nblack-hole charge mainly from the astrophysical point of view, which is\ncomplemented by a few historical as well as philosophical notes when relevant.\nIn particular, we show that a cosmic ray or in general elementary charged\nparticles passing a non-neutral black hole can experience an electromagnetic\nforce as much as sixteen times the gravitational force for the mass of the\nGalactic centre black hole and its charge being seventeen orders of magnitude\nless than the extremal value (calculated for a proton). Furthermore, a\nKerr-Newman rotating black hole with the maximum likely charge of 1 Coulomb per\nsolar mass can have the position of its innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO)\nmoved by both rotation and charge in ways that can enhance or partly cancel\neach other, putting the ISCO not far from the gravitational radius or out at\nmore than 6 gravitational radii. An interpretation of X-ray radiation from near\nthe ISCO of a black hole in X-ray binaries is then no longer unique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 13:28:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 2019 22:58:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

To train the\nSymNet, we propose a novel adversarial learning objective whose key design is\nbased on a two-level domain confusion scheme, where the category-level\nconfusion loss improves over the domain-level one by driving the learning of\nintermediate network features to be invariant at the corresponding categories\nof the two domains. Both domain discrimination and domain confusion are\nimplemented based on the constructed additional classifier. Since target\nsamples are unlabeled, we also propose a scheme of cross-domain training to\nhelp learn the target classifier. Careful ablation studies show the efficacy of\nour proposed method.

EQA\nmakes the fundamental assumption that every question, e.g., \"what color is the\ncar?\", has exactly one target (\"car\") being inquired about. This assumption\nputs a direct limitation on the abilities of the agent. We present a\ngeneralization of EQA - Multi-Target EQA (MT-EQA). Specifically, we study\nquestions that have multiple targets in them, such as \"Is the dresser in the\nbedroom bigger than the oven in the kitchen?\", where the agent has to navigate\nto multiple locations (\"dresser in bedroom\", \"oven in kitchen\") and perform\ncomparative reasoning (\"dresser\" bigger than \"oven\") before it can answer a\nquestion. Such questions require the development of entirely new modules or\ncomponents in the agent. To address this, we propose a modular architecture\ncomposed of a program generator, a controller, a navigator, and a VQA module.\nThe program generator converts the given question into sequential executable\nsub-programs; the navigator guides the agent to multiple locations pertinent to\nthe navigation-related sub-programs; and the controller learns to select\nrelevant observations along its path.

The recent Gaia Data Release (DR2) of trigonometric parallaxes\nincludes nearly all WN stars of our Galactic sample.

The presence of\nhyper-dense materials in a scene, such as metals, can strongly attenuate\nX-rays, producing severe streaking artifacts in the reconstruction.

This problem is\nparticularly acute in the security domain, where there is great heterogeneity\nin the objects that can appear in a scene, highly accurate decisions must be\nmade quickly. The standard practical approaches to reducing metal artifacts in\nCT imagery are either simplistic non-adaptive interpolation-based projection\ndata completion methods or direct image post-processing methods. These standard\napproaches have had limited success. Motivated primarily by security\napplications, we present a new deep-learning-based metal artifact reduction\n(MAR) approach that tackles the problem in the projection data domain. We treat\nthe projection data corresponding to metal objects as missing data and train an\nadversarial deep network to complete the missing data in the projection domain.\nThe subsequent complete projection data is then used with FBP to reconstruct\nimage intended to be free of artifacts.

The dependence from multiple risks is generally\nneglected even when correlation could exist, for example a single car accident\nmay result in claims from multiple risk categories. It is desirable to take the\ncovariance of different categories into consideration in modeling in order to\nbetter predict future claims and hence allow greater accuracy in ratemaking. In\nthis work multivariate severity models are investigated using mixture of\nexperts models with bivariate gamma distributions, where the dependence\nstructure is modeled directly using a GLM framework, and covariates can be\nplaced in both gating and expert networks. Furthermore, parsimonious\nparameterisations are considered, which leads to a family of bivariate gamma\nmixture of experts models. It can be viewed as a model-based clustering\napproach that clusters policyholders into sub-groups with different\ndependencies, and the parameters of the mixture models are dependent on the\ncovariates.

Effective\ntheory approach and exact diagonalization in a disk and torus geometries proves\nthe existence of the counter-propagating edge modes with opposite spin\npolarizations at the boundary between the two neighboring regions of the\ntwo-dimensional electron liquid in spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized phases.\nBy analytical and numerical analysis, we argue that these systems can host\nparafermions when coupled to an s-wave superconductor and are experimentally\nfeasible. We investigate settings based on $\\nu=\\frac{2}{3}$, $\\nu=\\frac{4}{3}$\nand $\\nu=\\frac{5}{3}$ spin transitions and analyze spin-flipping interactions\nthat hybridize counter-propagating modes. Finally, we discuss spin-orbit\ninteractions of composite fermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 14:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

One of the\npressing research challenges is thus to be able to use these subgraphs to\nunderstand the network topology of information cascades which ultimately paves\nthe way to theorize about how information spreads over time. In this paper, we\nmake the first attempt at using network motifs to understand whether or not\nthey can be used as generative elements for the diffusion network organization\nduring different phases of the cascade lifecycle. In doing so, we propose a\nmotif percolation-based algorithm that uses network motifs to measure the\nextent to which they can represent the temporal cascade network organization.\nWe compare two phases of the cascade lifecycle from the perspective of\ndiffusion-- the phase of steep growth and the phase of inhibition prior to its\nsaturation. Our experiments on a set of cascades from the Weibo platform and\nwith 5-node motifs demonstrate that there are only a few specific motif\npatterns with triads that are able to characterize the spreading process and\nhence the network organization during the inhibition region better than during\nthe phase of high growth.

These nonlinear\noscillations are one of the biggest challenges faced in the design of safe and\nreliable gas turbines and rocket motors. In the worst-case scenario,\nuncontrolled thermoacoustic oscillations can shake an engine apart.\nReduced-order thermoacoustic models, which are nonlinear and time-delayed, can\nonly qualitatively predict thermoacoustic oscillations. To make reduced-order\nmodels quantitatively predictive, we develop a data assimilation framework for\nstate estimation. We numerically estimate the most likely nonlinear state of a\nGalerkin-discretized time delayed model of a horizontal Rijke tube, which is a\nprototypical combustor. Data assimilation is an optimal blending of\nobservations with previous state estimates (background) to produce optimal\ninitial conditions. A cost functional is defined to measure the statistical\ndistance between the model output and the measurements from experiments; and\nthe distance between the initial conditions and the background knowledge. Its\nminimum corresponds to the optimal state, which is computed by Lagrangian\noptimization with the aid of adjoint equations. We study the influence of the\nnumber of Galerkin modes, which are the natural acoustic modes of the duct,\nwith which the model is discretized. We show that decomposing the measured\npressure signal in a finite number of modes is an effective way to enhance\nstate estimation, especially when nonlinear modal interactions occur during the\nassimilation window. This work represents the first application of data\nassimilation to nonlinear thermoacoustics, which opens up new possibilities for\nreal-time calibration of reduced-order models with experimental measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 10:12:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-28"}

The formalism first leads to different physical interactions from\nthe use of an exponential cluster operator for radiative effects. Lamb, Breit\nand hyperfine interactions are obtained. Next, relativistic many-body effects\nare determined using the matter cluster in a way familiar from the\nnonrelativistic CC. This step can be nontrivial. By allowing the matter cluster\nto deviate from its traditional excitation-only form, vacuum polarization\neffects are generated using the pair part of Coulomb interaction. The resulting\nground state correlation energy includes both relativistic and QED corrections,\nthe latter including contributions from Lamb, Breit, hyperfine and vacuum\npolarization effects. The many-electron part of the theory is explicitly\nformulated for closed shell species. The conservatism of the second step\nindicates that extensions to multireference and state-specific cases are\npossible. To illustrate the CC approach, expressions are derived for\nrelativistic and QED corrections to the orbital energies, configuration\nenergies and the ground state correlation energy in a minimal basis calculation\non noninteracting H2 molecules. Size-consistency is maintained at every step.\nBecause spinors of nonzero orbital angular momentum are absent, the spin-orbit\ninteraction and Lamb shift corrections vanish in this example. However, one\nfinds the kinetic energy correction, Darwin terms and corrections to the\ntwo-electron interaction in relativistic energy values through order mc2a4Z4,\nand Breit interaction energy and hyperfine splitting of levels as QED effects\nthrough the same order. Pair energies are explicitly shown through the lowest\npossible orders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 16:18:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 05:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

In order to\nbridge that gap, we propose to generate large-scale user/item interaction data\nsets by expanding pre-existing public data sets. Our key contribution is a\ntechnique that expands user/item incidence matrices matrices to large numbers\nof rows (users), columns (items), and non-zero values (interactions). The\nproposed method adapts Kronecker Graph Theory to preserve key higher order\nstatistical properties such as the fat-tailed distribution of user engagements,\nitem popularity, and singular value spectra of user/item interaction matrices.\nPreserving such properties is key to building large realistic synthetic data\nsets which in turn can be employed reliably to benchmark recommender systems\nand the systems employed to train them. We further apply our stochastic\nexpansion algorithm to the binarized MovieLens 20M data set, which comprises\n20M interactions between 27K movies and 138K users. The resulting expanded data\nset has 1.2B ratings, 2.2M users, and 855K items, which can be scaled up or\ndown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 17:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-27"}

This is achieved\nby introducing an additional loss function during the training of the ESNs,\nwhich penalizes non-physical predictions without the need of any additional\ntraining data. This approach is demonstrated on a chaotic Lorenz system, where\nthe physics-informed ESNs improve the predictability horizon by about two\nLyapunov times as compared to conventional ESNs. The proposed framework shows\nthe potential of using machine learning combined with prior physical knowledge\nto improve the time-accurate prediction of chaotic dynamical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 10:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-28"}

Digital\nimage correlation was utilized with confocal laser scanning microscope images\nto better visualize crack initiation during tensile straining.

Finally, after computer\nimplementation, validation of the model is performed against experiments\ndeveloped on specially designed ceramic pieces, characterized by zones of\ndifferent density.
