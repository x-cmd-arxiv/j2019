This family is based on new copula-like densities on the\nhypercube with non-uniform marginals which can be sampled efficiently, i.e.\nwith a complexity linear in the dimension of state space. Then, the proposed\nvariational densities that we suggest can be seen as arising from these\ncopula-like densities used as base distributions on the hypercube with Gaussian\nquantile functions and sparse rotation matrices as normalizing flows. The\nlatter correspond to a rotation of the marginals with complexity $\\mathcal{O}(d\n\\log d)$. We provide some empirical evidence that such a variational family can\nalso approximate non-Gaussian posteriors and can be beneficial compared to\nGaussian approximations. Our method performs largely comparably to\nstate-of-the-art variational approximations on standard regression and\nclassification benchmarks for Bayesian Neural Networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 16:08:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 13:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

In this paper, we therefore propose a systematic way to test the\ntrustworthiness of deep music representations, considering musical semantics.\nThe underlying assumption is that in case a deep representation is to be\ntrusted, distance consistency between known related points should be maintained\nboth in the input audio space and corresponding latent deep space. We generate\nknown related points through semantically meaningful transformations, both\nconsidering imperceptible and graver transformations. Then, we examine within-\nand between-space distance consistencies, both considering audio space and\nlatent embedded space, the latter either being a result of a conventional\nfeature extractor or a deep encoder.

To\nbe scalable, atomic multicast needs to be genuine, meaning that only the\ndestination processes of a message should participate in ordering it. In this\npaper we propose a novel genuine atomic multicast protocol that in the absence\nof failures takes as low as 3 message delays to deliver a message when no other\nmessages are multicast concurrently to its destination groups, and 5 message\ndelays in the presence of concurrency. This improves the latencies of both the\nfault-tolerant version of classical Skeen's multicast protocol (6 or 12 message\ndelays, depending on concurrency) and its recent improvement by Coelho et al.\n(4 or 8 message delays). To achieve such low latencies, we depart from the\ntypical way of guaranteeing fault-tolerance by replicating each group with\nPaxos. Instead, we weave Paxos and Skeen's protocol together into a single\ncoherent protocol, exploiting opportunities for white-box optimisations. We\nexperimentally demonstrate that the superior theoretical characteristics of our\nprotocol are reflected in practical performance pay-offs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 16:37:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

However,\nwhere the SSP property is needed, IMEX SSP Runge-Kutta (SSP-IMEX) methods have\nvery restrictive time-steps. An alternative to SSP-IMEX schemes is to adopt an\nintegrating factor approach to handle the linear component exactly and step the\ntransformed problem forward using some time-evolution method. The strong\nstability properties of integrating factor Runge--Kutta methods were previously\nestablished, where it was shown that it is possible to define explicit\nintegrating factor Runge-Kutta methods that preserve strong stability\nproperties satisfied by each of the two components when coupled with forward\nEuler time-stepping. It was proved that the solution will be SSP if the\ntransformed problem is stepped forward with an explicit SSP Runge-Kutta method\nthat has non-decreasing abscissas. However, explicit SSP Runge-Kutta methods\nhave an order barrier of p=4, and sometimes higher order is desired.

We show that strong stability is ensured if the two-step\nRunge-Kutta method used to evolve the transformed problem is SSP and has\nnon-decreasing abscissas. We find such methods up to eighth order and present\ntheir SSP coefficients. Adding a step allows us to break the fourth order\nbarrier on explicit SSP Runge-Kutta methods; furthermore, our explicit SSP\ntwo-step Runge--Kutta methods with non-decreasing abscissas typically have\nlarger SSP coefficients than the corresponding one-step methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 17:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

Furthermore, recent literature suggests\nthe phenomena of gentrification as a cause of perpetuation or increase of\nracial residential segregation in some American cities. In this paper, we\nanalyze the dynamics of racial residential segregation for white, black, Asian,\nand Hispanic citizens in New York City in the years of 1990, 2000, and 2010. It\nwas possible to observe that segregation between white and Hispanic citizens,\nand discrimination between white and Asian ones has grown, while segregation\nbetween white and black is quite stable. Furthermore, we analyzed the per\ncapita income and the Gini coefficient in each segregated zone, showing that\nthe highest inequalities occur in the zones where there is overlap of\nhigh-density zones of pair of races. Focusing on census tracts that have\nchanged density of population during these twenty years, and, particularly, by\nanalyzing white and black people's segregation, our analysis reveals that a\npositive flux of white (black) people is associated to a substantial increase\n(decrease) of the property values, as compared with the city mean. Furthermore,\nby clustering the region of high density of black citizens, we measured the\nvariation of area and displacement of the four biggest clusters in the period\nfrom 1990 to 2010. The large displacements (~ 1.6 Km) observed for two of these\nclusters, namely, one in the neighborhood of Harlem and the other inside the\nborough of Brooklyn, led to the emergence of typically gentrified regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 17:30:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 06:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-18"}

Accordingly, re-id models are often trained in a\nstraightforward manner on the generated data. In this paper, we seek to improve\nlearned re-id embeddings by better leveraging the generated data. To this end,\nwe propose a joint learning framework that couples re-id learning and data\ngeneration end-to-end. Our model involves a generative module that separately\nencodes each person into an appearance code and a structure code, and a\ndiscriminative module that shares the appearance encoder with the generative\nmodule. By switching the appearance or structure codes, the generative module\nis able to generate high-quality cross-id composed images, which are online fed\nback to the appearance encoder and used to improve the discriminative module.\nThe proposed joint learning framework renders significant improvement over the\nbaseline without using generated data, leading to the state-of-the-art\nperformance on several benchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 17:59:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 10:33:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 06:36:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

Using archival optical and near infrared data\nwith the energy-balance code CIGALE we calculate star formation rates, and\nstellar masses for all our cluster members, and find the star formation rate\nvaries between 20-1600M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ over the entire 3Mpc radial range.\nThe central 0.5Mpc region itself has a total star formation rate of\n800$\\pm$200M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, which corresponds to a star formation rate\ndensity of (1.2$\\pm$0.3)$\\times$10$^{4}$M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-3}$, which\nis approximately five orders of magnitude greater than expected field values.\nWhen comparing this cluster to those at lower redshifts we find that there is\nan increase in star formation rate per unit volume towards the centre of the\ncluster. This indicates that there is indeed a reversal in the star\nformation/density relation in CLJ1449. Based on the radial star-formation rate\ndensity profile, we see evidence for an elevation in the star formation rate\ndensity, even out to radii of 3Mpc. At these radii the elevation could be an\norder of magnitude greater than field values, but the exact number cannot be\ndetermined due to ambiguity in the redshift associations. If this is the case\nit would imply that this cluster is still accreting material which is possibly\ninteracting and undergoing vigorous star-formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

Very striking differences are\nfound. At z=0, gas column density and temperature profiles at large radii\n($\\sim 100$ kpc) correlate strongly with disk gas mass fraction in Illustris,\nbut not in TNG. The neutral gas at large radii is preferentially aligned in the\nplane of the disk in TNG, whereas it is much more isotropic in Illustris. The\nvertical coherence scale of the rotationally supported gas in the CGM is linked\nto the gas mass fraction of the galaxy in Illustris, but not in TNG. A tracer\nparticle analysis allows us to show how these differences can be understood as\na consequence of the different sub-grid models of feedback in the two\nsimulations. A study of spatially matched galaxies in the two simulations shows\nthat in TNG, feedback by supernovae and AGN helps to create an extended smooth\nreservoir of hot gas at high redshifts, that then cools to form a thin,\nrotationally-supported disk at later times. In Illustris, AGN dump heat in the\nform of hot gas bubbles that push diffuse material at large radii out of the\nhalo. The disk is formed by accretion of colder, recycled material, and this\nresults in more vertically extended gas distributions above and below the\nGalactic plane.

In biological\nsystems, often diverse species are simultaneously present and interact with\neach other. Here, we derive a (time-dependent) particle-scale statistical\ndescription, namely a dynamical density functional theory, for such\nmulti-species systems, extending existing works on one-component microswimmer\nsuspensions. In particular, our theory incorporates the effect of external\npotentials, but also steric and hydrodynamic interactions between swimmers. For\nthe latter, a previously introduced force-dipole-based minimal (pusher or\npuller) microswimmer model is used. As a limiting case of our theory, mixtures\nof hydrodynamically interacting active and passive particles are captured as\nwell. After deriving the theory, we apply it to different planar swimmer\nconfigurations. First, these are binary pusher--puller mixtures in external\ntraps. In the considered situations, we find that the majority species imposes\nits behavior on the minority species. Second, for unconfined binary\npusher--puller mixtures, the linear stability of an orientationally disordered\nstate against the emergence of global polar orientational order (and thus\nemergent collective motion) is tested analytically. Our statistical approach\npredicts, qualitatively in line with previous particle-based computer\nsimulations, a threshold for the fraction of pullers and for their propulsion\nstrength that lets overall collective motion arise. Third, we let driven\npassive colloidal particles form the boundaries of a shear cell, with confined\nactive microswimmers on their inside. Driving the passive particles then\neffectively imposes shear flows, which persistently acts on the inside\nmicroswimmers. Their resulting behavior reminds of the one of circle swimmers,\nthough with varying swimming radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 18:26:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 14:43:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

Unfortunately, existing formulations of DOT can model only types\nof the form $x.A$ which depend on variables rather than general paths. This\nrestriction makes it impossible to model nested module dependencies. Nesting\nsmall components inside larger ones is a necessary ingredient of a modular,\nscalable language. DOT's variable restriction thus undermines its ability to\nfully formalize a variety of programming-language features including Scala's\nmodule system, family polymorphism, and covariant specialization.\n  This paper presents the pDOT calculus, which generalizes DOT to support types\nthat depend on paths of arbitrary length, as well as singleton types to track\npath equality. We show that naive approaches to add paths to DOT make it\ninherently unsound, and present necessary conditions for such a calculus to be\nsound.

To tackle such\nserious privacy concerns, several privacy-preserving approaches have been\nproposed in the literature that use either secure multi-party computation (SMC)\nor homomorphic encryption (HE) as the underlying mechanisms.

Since the routing coefficients are\nresponsible for assigning object parts to wholes, and an object whole generally\ncontains similar intra-class and dissimilar inter-class parts, the routing\ncoefficients tend to form a unique signature for each object class. For fast\ninference, a network is first trained in the usual manner using examples from\nthe training dataset.

During inference, these master routing coefficients are\nused in place of the dynamically calculated routing coefficients.

Moreover, recent studies\nhave also highlighted the importance of obliquities in sculpting not only the\nphysical features of exoplanets but also their orbital architectures. It is\ntherefore of key importance to identify and characterize the dominant processes\nof excitation of non-zero axial tilts. Here we highlight a simple mechanism\nthat operates early on and is likely fundamental for many extrasolar planets\nand perhaps even Solar System planets. While planets are still forming in the\nprotoplanetary disk, the gravitational potential of the disk induces nodal\nrecession of the orbits. The frequency of this recession decreases as the disk\ndissipates, and when it crosses the frequency of a planet's spin axis\nprecession, large planetary obliquities may be excited through capture into a\nsecular spin-orbit resonance. We study the conditions for encountering this\nresonance and calculate the resulting obliquity excitation over a wide range of\nparameter space. Planets with semi-major axes in the range $0.3 \\ \\mathrm{AU}\n\\lesssim a \\lesssim 2 \\ \\mathrm{AU}$ are the most readily affected, but\nlarge-$a$ planets can also be impacted. We present a case study of Uranus and\nNeptune and show that this mechanism likely cannot help explain their high\nobliquities. While it could have played a role if finely tuned and envisioned\nto operate in isolation, large-scale obliquity excitation was likely inhibited\nby gravitational planet-planet perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 21:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

Two modern AQMs (PIE and CoDel) are\ndesigned to keep queuing delay to a target by dropping packets as load varies.\nThis memo uses Curvy RED and an idealised but sufficient model of TCP traffic\nto explain why attempting to keep delay constant is a bad idea, because it\nrequires excessively high drop at high loads. This high drop itself takes over\nfrom queuing delay as the dominant cause of delay, particularly for short\nflows. At high load, a link is better able to preserve reasonable performance\nif the delay target is softened into a curve rather than a hard cap. The\nanalysis proves that the same AQM can be deployed in different parts of a\nnetwork whatever the capacity with the same optimal configuration. A surprising\ncorollary of this analysis concerns cases with a highly aggregated number of\nflows through a bottleneck. Although aggregation reduces queue variation, if\nthe target queuing delay of the AQM at that bottleneck is reduced to take\nadvantage of this aggregation, TCP will still increase the loss level because\nof the reduction in round trip time. The way to resolve this dilemma is to\noverprovision (a formula is provided). Nonetheless, for traffic with ECN\nenabled, there is no harm in an AQM holding queuing delay constant or\nconfiguring an AQM to take advantage of any reduced delay due to aggregation\nwithout over-provisioning. Recently, the requirement of the ECN standard that\nECN must be treated the same as drop has been questioned. The insight that the\ngoals of an AQM for drop and for ECN should be different proves that this doubt\nis justified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 21:48:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

To estimate the permeabilities,\nestimation of the strain time constant (TC) is required, which is a challenging\ntask because of non-linearity of the exponential strain curve and noise present\nin the experimental data. Moreover, noise in many strain frames becomes very\nhigh because of motion artifacts from the sonographer, animal/patient and/or\nthe environment.

When the coexisting\nphases are elastically coherent, the elastic interactions between these phases\nplay a major role in the development of microstructures. To elucidate the key\neffects of elastic stress on microstructural evolution when more than two\nmisfitting phases are present in the microstructure, we have developed a\nmicroelastic phase-field model in two dimensions to study phase separation in\nternary alloy system. Numerical solutions of a set of coupled Cahn-Hilliard\nequations for the composition fields govern the spatiotemporal evolution of the\nthree-phase microstructure. The model incorporates coherency strain\ninteractions between the phases using Khachaturyan's microelasticity theory. We\nsystematically vary the misfit strains (magnitude and sign) between the phases\nalong with the bulk alloy composition to study their effects on the\nmorphological development of the phases and the resulting phase separation\nkinetics. We also vary the ratio of interfacial energies between the phases to\nunderstand the interplay between elastic and interfacial energies on\nmorphological evolution. The sign and degree of misfit affect strain\npartitioning between the phases during spinodal decomposition, thereby\naffecting their compositional history and morphology. Moreover, strain\npartitioning affects solute partitioning and alters the kinetics of coarsening\nof the phases. The phases associated with higher misfit strain appear coarser\nand exhibit wider size distribution compared to those having lower misfit. When\nthe interfacial energies satisfy complete wetting condition, phase separation\nleads to development of stable core-shell morphology depending on the misfit\nbetween the core (wetted) and the shell (wetting) phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 02:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

Many recent studies have proven that\nquantization-based approaches perform generally better than hashing-based\napproaches on single-modal similarity search. In this paper, we propose a deep\nquantization approach, which is among the early attempts of leveraging deep\nneural networks into quantization-based cross-modal similarity search. Our\napproach, dubbed shared predictive deep quantization (SPDQ), explicitly\nformulates a shared subspace across different modalities and two private\nsubspaces for individual modalities, and representations in the shared subspace\nand the private subspaces are learned simultaneously by embedding them to a\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space, where the mean embedding of different\nmodality distributions can be explicitly compared. In addition, in the shared\nsubspace, a quantizer is learned to produce the semantics preserving compact\ncodes with the help of label alignment. Thanks to this novel network\narchitecture in cooperation with supervised quantization training, SPDQ can\npreserve intramodal and intermodal similarities as much as possible and greatly\nreduce quantization error.

Acquiring an accurate channel estimate is the key to\nfacilitate advanced millimeter wave hybrid multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) precoding techniques. Millimeter wave MIMO channel estimation, however,\nsuffers from a considerably increased channel use overhead. This happens due to\nthe limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains that prevent the digital\nbaseband from directly accessing the signal at each antenna. To address this\nissue, recent research has focused on adaptive closed-loop and two-way channel\nestimation techniques. In this paper, unlike the prior approaches, we study a\nnon-adaptive, hence rather simple, open-loop millimeter wave MIMO channel\nestimation technique. We present a simple random design of channel subspace\nsampling signals and show that they obey the restricted isometry property (RIP)\nwith high probability. We then formulate the channel estimation as a low-rank\nsubspace decomposition problem and, based on the RIP, show that the proposed\nframework reveals resilience to a low signal-to-noise ratio. It is revealed\nthat the required number of channel uses ensuring a bounded estimation error is\nlinearly proportional to the degrees of freedom of the channel, whereas it\nconverges to a constant value if the number of RF chains can grow\nproportionally to the channel dimension while keeping the channel rank fixed.\nIn particular, we show that the tighter the RIP characterization the lower the\nchannel estimation error is. We also devise an iterative technique that\neffectively finds a suboptimal but stationary solution to the formulated\nproblem. The proposed technique is shown to have improved channel estimation\naccuracy with a low channel use overhead as compared to that of previous\nclosed-loop and two-way adaptation techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 07:41:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2020 15:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

The massive star possesses\nan equatorial disc, which is inclined with the orbital plane of the pulsar. The\nnon-thermal emission from the system is believed to be produced by the pulsar\nwind shock and the double-peak profiles in the X-ray and TeV $\\gamma$-ray light\ncurves are related to the phases of the pulsar passing through the disc region\nof the star. In this paper, we investigate the interactions between the pulsar\nwind and stellar outflows, especially with the presence of the disc, and\npresent a multi-wavelength modelling of the emission from this system. We show\nthat the double-peak profiles of X-ray and TeV $\\gamma$-ray light curves are\ncaused by the enhancements of the magnetic field and the soft photons at the\nshock during the disc passages. As the pulsar is passing through the equatorial\ndisc, the additional pressure of the disc pushes the shock surface closer to\nthe pulsar, which causes the enhancement of magnetic field in the shock, and\nthus increases the synchrotron luminosity. The TeV $\\gamma$-rays due to the\ninverse-Compton (IC) scattering of shocked electrons with seed photons from the\nstar is expected to peak around periastron which is inconsistent with\nobservations. However, the shock heating of the stellar disc could provide\nadditional seed photons for IC scattering during the disc passages, and thus\nproduces the double-peak profiles as observed in the TeV $\\gamma$-ray light\ncurve.

It\nwould, therefore, be useful to find a representation of hand pose which is\nindependent of the image appearance~(like hand texture, lighting, background),\nso that we can synthesize unseen images by mixing pose-appearance combinations.\nIn this paper, we present a novel technique that disentangles the\nrepresentation of pose from a complementary appearance factor in 2D monochrome\nimages.

While most previous\nworks predict a single future, multiple futures with different behavior can\npotentially occur. Moreover, if the predicted future is too short (e.g., less\nthan one second), it may not be fully usable by a human or other systems. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel method for future human pose prediction capable\nof predicting multiple long-term futures. This makes the predictions more\nsuitable for real applications. Also, from the input video and the predicted\nhuman behavior, we generate future videos. First, from an input human video, we\ngenerate sequences of future human poses (i.e., the image coordinates of their\nbody-joints) via adversarial learning. Adversarial learning suffers from mode\ncollapse, which makes it difficult to generate a variety of multiple poses. We\nsolve this problem by utilizing two additional inputs to the generator to make\nthe outputs diverse, namely, a latent code (to reflect various behaviors) and\nan attraction point (to reflect various trajectories). In addition, we generate\nlong-term future human poses using a novel approach based on unidimensional\nconvolutional neural networks.

The comparison between the observations of the nitrogen bearing\nspecies and the predictions from the chemical modelling shows a very good\nagreement, taking into account the new chemical network.

In a\nquiescent fluid, a slowly settling particle orients so that it settles with its\nbroad side first. This is an effect of the torque due to convective inertia of\nthe fluid set in motion by the settling particle, which maximises the drag\nexperienced by the particle. Turbulent flows tend to randomise the particle\norientation. Recently the settling of non-spherical particles in turbulence was\nanalysed neglecting the effect of convective fluid inertia, but taking into\naccount the effect of the turbulent fluid-velocity gradients on the particle\norientation. These studies reached the opposite conclusion, namely that a rod\nsettles preferentially with its tip first, wheras a disk settles with its edge\nfirst, therefore minimizing the drag on the particle. Here, we consider both\neffects, the convective inertial torque as well as the torque due to\nfluctuating velocity gradients, and ask under which circumstances either one or\nthe other dominate. To this end we estimate the ratio of the magnitudes of the\ntwo torques. Our estimates suggest that the fluid-inertia torque prevails in\nhigh-Reynolds number flows. In this case non-spherical particles are expected\nto settle with a maximal drag. But when the Reynolds number is small then the\ntorque due to fluid-velocity gradients may dominate, causing the particle to\nsettle with its broad side first.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 10:16:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 12:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

Laminar transport, arguably, is best described by the\nLagrangian fluid motion (`advection') and the geometry, topology and coherence\nof fluid trajectories. Efficient laminar transport being equivalent to `chaotic\nadvection' is a key finding of this approach.\n  The Lagrangian framework enables systematic analysis and design of laminar\nflows.

Different from LSPR, the PDG index\nsensor is based on the momentum matching between photons and surface plasmons\nvia the lattice momentum of the grating.

We present a\nnew statistical methodology to constrain the evolution of the mass-observable\nrelations. Instead of measuring individual mass of galaxy clusters, we only\nconsider large scale homogeneity of the Universe. In this case, we expect the\npresent galaxy cluster mass function to be the same everywhere in the Universe.\nUsing relative abundance matching, we contraint the relation between the\nrichness, $\\lambda(z)$, and the expected present mass, $M(t_0)$, of galaxy\nclusters. We apply this approach to the redMaPPer galaxy cluster catalogue in\n10 redshift bins from $z=0.1$ to $0.6$. We found that the $\\lambda(z)$-$M(t_0)$\nrelation is not evolving from $z=0.1$ to $0.4$, whereas it starts to\nsignificantly evolve at higher redshift. This results implies that the\nredMaPPer richness appears to be a better proxy for the expected present-day\ngalaxy cluster mass than for the mass at the observational redshift. Assuming\ncosmology and galaxy cluster mass accretion history, it is possible to convert\n$M(t_0)$ to the mass at the galaxy cluster redshift $M(t_z)$.

Different mechanisms have been proposed to relate atrial\nfibrillation (AF) and coronary flow impairment, even in absence of relevant\ncoronary artery disease (CAD). However, the underlying hemodynamics remains\nunclear. Aim of the present work is to computationally explore whether and to\nwhat extent ventricular rate during AF affects the coronary perfusion.\n  Methods. AF is simulated at different ventricular rates (50, 70, 90, 110, 130\nbpm) through a 0D-1D multiscale validated model, which combines the left\nheart-arterial tree together with the coronary circulation. Artificially-built\nRR stochastic extraction mimics the \\emph{in vivo} beating features. All the\nhemodynamic parameters computed are based on the left anterior descending (LAD)\nartery and account for the waveform, amplitude and perfusion of the coronary\nblood flow.\n  Results. Alterations of the coronary hemodynamics are found to be associated\neither to the heart rate increase, which strongly modifies waveform and\namplitude of the LAD flow rate, and to the beat-to-beat variability. The latter\nis overall amplified in the coronary circulation as HR grows, even though the\ninput RR variability is kept constant at all HRs.\n  Conclusions. Higher ventricular rate during AF exerts an overall coronary\nblood flow impairment and imbalance of the myocardial oxygen supply-demand\nratio. The combined increase of heart rate and higher AF-induced hemodynamic\nvariability lead to a coronary perfusion impairment exceeding 90-110 bpm in AF.\nMoreover, it is found that coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) is no longer a\ngood measure of the myocardial perfusion for HR higher than 90 bpm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 12:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

By mapping inputs onto a very large feature space,\ndeep learning algorithms can be trained to fingerprint large populations of\ndevices operating under any wireless standard. One of the most crucial\nchallenges in radio fingerprinting is to counteract the action of the wireless\nchannel, which decreases fingerprinting accuracy significantly by disrupting\nhardware impairments.

For a perfectly flat and homogeneously\nloaded interface, we find that slip is nucleated by avalanches of asperity\ndetachments of extension larger than a critical radius $A_c$ governed by a\nGriffith criterion. We find that after slip, the density of asperities at a\nlocal distance to yielding $x_\\sigma$ presents a pseudo-gap $P(x_\\sigma) \\sim\n(x_\\sigma)^\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is a non-universal exponent that depends on\nthe statistics of the disorder.

This has significant benefits including reduced expenses for\nthe company and more importantly, a reduction in the degree of road use and\nhence vehicular emissions. Exact optimisation methods fail to scale to real\ncommercial problem instances, thus meta-heuristics are more suitable. Ant\nColony Optimisation (ACO) generally provides good solutions on small to medium\nproblem sizes. However, commercial fleet optimisation problems are typically\nlarge and complex, in which ACO fails to scale well. Partial-ACO is a new ACO\nvariant designed to scale to larger problem instances. Therefore this paper\ninvestigates the application of Partial-ACO on the problem of fleet\noptimisation, demonstrating the capacity of Partial-ACO to successfully scale\nto larger problems. Indeed, for real-world fleet optimisation problems supplied\nby a Birmingham based company with up to 298 jobs and 32 vehicles, Partial-ACO\ncan improve upon their fleet traversal times by over 44%. Moreover, Partial-ACO\ndemonstrates its ability to scale with considerably improved results over\nstandard ACO and competitive results against a Genetic Algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 13:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

Dense\nmolecular cores are observed mainly toward the filament ends, and are close to\nvirial equilibrium. Position-velocity plots trace velocity gradients (~1\nkm/s/pc) toward both the ends. An oscillatory pattern in velocity is also\nobserved toward the filament, indicating its fragmentation. The collapse\ntimescale of the filament is computed to be ~3.5 Myr.

The method itself, originally proposed by Ho\nand Kalman and utilizing linear algebra, is an intuitive tool retrieving\ninformation out of the data themselves. Finally, with the help of the\nlimitations of the methods, the potential future outlook is discussed, under\nthe prism of forming a digital twin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 13:32:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 May 2020 10:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-11"}

ADC dependence on OGSE\nfrequency has been explored in numerous rodent studies, but applications in the\nhuman brain have been limited and have suffered from low contrast between\ndifferent frequencies, long scan times and a limited exploration of the nature\nof the ADC dependence on frequency. Methods: Multiple frequency OGSE\nacquisitions were acquired in healthy subjects at 7 T to explore the power-law\nfrequency dependence of ADC, the \"diffusion dispersion\". Further, a method for\noptimizing the estimation of the ADC difference between different OGSE\nfrequencies was developed, which enabled the design of a highly efficient\nprotocol for mapping diffusion dispersion. Results: For the first time,\nevidence of a linear dependence of ADC on the square root of frequency in\nhealthy human white matter was obtained.

The list color function of graph $G$,\ndenoted $P_{\\ell}(G,m)$, is a list analogue of the chromatic polynomial that\nhas been studied since 1992, primarily through comparisons with the\ncorresponding chromatic polynomial. DP-coloring (also called correspondence\ncoloring) is a generalization of list coloring recently introduced by\nDvo\\v{r}\\'{a}k and Postle. In this paper, we introduce a DP-coloring analogue\nof the chromatic polynomial called the DP color function, denoted\n$P_{DP}(G,m)$, and ask several fundamental open questions about it, making\nprogress on some of them. Motivated by known results related to the list color\nfunction, we show that while the DP color function behaves similar to the list\ncolor function for some graphs, there are also some surprising differences. For\nexample, Wang, Qian, and Yan recently showed that if $G$ is a connected graph\nwith $l$ edges, then $P_{\\ell}(G,m)=P(G,m)$ whenever $m > \\frac{l-1}{\\ln(1+\n\\sqrt{2})}$, but we will show that for any $g \\geq 3$ there exists a graph,\n$G$, with girth $g$ such that $P_{DP}(G,m) < P(G,m)$ when $m$ is sufficiently\nlarge. We also study the asymptotics of $P(G,m) - P_{DP}(G,m)$ for a fixed\ngraph $G$. We develop techniques to compute $P_{DP}(G,m)$ exactly and apply\nthem to certain classes of graphs such as chordal graphs, unicyclic graphs, and\ncycles with a chord. Finally, we make progress towards showing that for any\ngraph $G$, there is a $p$ such that $P_{DP}(G \\vee K_p, m) = P(G \\vee K_p , m)$\nfor large enough $m$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 14:12:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 01:08:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 15:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-13"}

The affinity dimension prescribes a value for the\nHausdorff dimension of a self-affine set which is known to be correct in\ngeneric cases and in an increasing range of explicit cases.

In this article we prove that when the linear parts of the affinities\nwhich define the IFS are $2 \\times 2$ matrices which strictly preserve a common\ncone, the sub-additive pressure is locally real analytic as a function of the\nmatrix coefficients of the linear parts of the affinities.

We find that the\nsource star is an oscillating red giant with average timescale of $\\sim 9$ d.\nThe asteroseismic analysis also provides us source properties including the\nsource angular size ($\\sim 27~\\mu{\\rm as}$) and distance ($\\sim 11.5$ kpc),\nwhich are essential for inferring the properties of the lens. When fitting the\nlight curve, we test the feasibility of Gaussian Processes (GPs) in handling\nthe correlated noise caused by the variable source.

The planar non-convex contact\npatch can either be a topologically connected set or disconnected set. Such\nalgorithms are useful in planning and control for robotic manipulation. Most\nworks in rigid body dynamic simulation assume that the contact between objects\nis a point contact, which may not be valid in many applications. In this paper,\nby using the convex hull of the contact patch, we build on our recent work on\nsimulating rigid bodies with convex contact patches, for simulating the motion\nof objects with planar non-convex contact patches. We formulate a discrete-time\nmixed complementarity problem where we solve the contact detection and\nintegration of the equations of motion simultaneously. Thus, our method is a\ngeometrically-implicit method and we prove that in our formulation, there is no\nartificial penetration between the contacting rigid bodies. We solve for the\nequivalent contact point (ECP) and contact impulse of each contact patch\nsimultaneously along with the state, i.e., configuration and velocity of the\nobjects.

Several studies have\nmodelled the evolution of the electromagnetic emission using the synchrotron\nemission produced by the deceleration of both a relativistic top-hat jet seen\noff-axis, and a wide-angle quasi-spherical outflow (both using numerical\nstudies). In this study we present an analytical model of the synchrotron and\nsynchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission for an off-axis top-hat jet and a\nquasi-spherical outflow. We calculate the light curves obtained from an\nanalytic model in which the synchrotron and SSC emission (in the fast- or\nslow-cooling regime) of an off-axis top-hat jet and a quasi-spherical outflow\nare decelerated in either a homogeneous or a wind-like circumburst medium. We\nshow that the synchrotron emission of the quasi-spherical outflow is stronger\nthan that of the off-axis jet during the first $\\sim$ 10 - 20 days, and weaker\nduring the next $\\gtrsim$ 80 days. Moreover, we show that if the off-axis jet\nis decelerated in a wind-like medium, then the SSC emission is very likely to\nbe detected. Applying a MCMC code to our model (for synchrotron emission only),\nwe find the best-fit values for the radio, optical and X-ray emission of GRB\n170817A which are in accordance with observations.

It is explicitly present in the full gluon self-energy. The true\ndynamical role of the mass gap was hidden in the QCD ground state. To disclose\nit the splintering between the transverse conditions for the full gluon\nself-energy and its subtracted counterpart has been derived. We have\nestablished the equation of motion for the full gluon propagator on account of\nthe mass gap. It allows to fix the dynamical and gauge structures of the full\ngluon propagator with a newly-derived generalized gauge. It is uniquely given\nas a function of the gluon momentum. All this makes it possible to present\nnovel non-perturbative analytical approach to QCD, which we call the mass gap\napproach. It extends the mass gap concept to be accounted for the QCD ground\nstate as well.

For this the\nnon-perturbative multiplicative renormalization program for the full massive\ngluon propagator has been formulated.

In this\ncase the number density of dust for a certain dust grains radius can be\ncalculated analytically based on the classical `cold model'. The dust density\ndistribution for the mixture of dust grains with different radii is calculated.\nWe also calculated intensity maps of the thermal infrared emission at 24~$\\mu$m\nfrom dust due to heating by the stellar radiation.

Interactive recommender\nsystems present an opportunity to engage the user in the process by allowing\nthem to interact with the recommendations, provide feedback and impact the\nresults in real-time. Evaluation of the impact of the user interaction\ntypically requires an extensive user study which is time consuming and gives\nresearchers limited opportunities to tune their solutions without having to\nconduct multiple rounds of user feedback. Additionally, user experience and\ndesign aspects can have a significant impact on the user feedback which may\nresult in not necessarily assessing the quality of some of the underlying\nalgorithmic decisions in the overall solution.

Here, we investigate the resilience of\nurban water supply security, which is defined in terms of the services that\ncitizens receive. The resilience of services is determined by the availability\nand robustness of critical system elements, or 'capitals' (water resources,\ninfrastructure, finances, management efficacy and community adaptation). We\ntranslate quantitative information about this portfolio of capitals from seven\ncontrasting cities on four continents into parameters of a coupled systems\ndynamics model.

Resilience emerges\nunder various constraints, expressed in terms of each city's capital portfolio.\nSystematic assessment of the parameter space produces the urban water\nresilience landscape, and we determine the position of each city along a\ncontinuous gradient from water insecure and non-resilient to secure and\nresilient systems. In several cities stochastic disturbance regimes challenge\nsteady-state conditions and drive system collapse. While water insecure and\nnon-resilient cities risk being pushed into a poverty trap, cities which have\ndeveloped excess capitals risk being trapped in rigidity and crossing a tipping\npoint from high to low services and collapse.

His method was the first really useful\nengineering method in the field of pipe network calculation. Only electrical\nanalogs of hydraulic networks were used before the Hardy Cross method. A\nproblem with flow resistance versus electrical resistance makes these\nelectrical analog methods obsolete. The method by Hardy Cross is taught\nextensively at faculties, and it remains an important tool for the analysis of\nlooped pipe systems. Engineers today mostly use a modified Hardy Cross method\nwhich considers the whole looped network of pipes simultaneously (use of these\nmethods without computers is practically impossible). A method from a Russian\npractice published during the 1930s, which is similar to the Hardy Cross\nmethod, is described, too. Some notes from the work of Hardy Cross are also\npresented. Finally, an improved version of the Hardy Cross method, which\nsignificantly reduces the number of iterations, is presented and discussed. We\nalso tested multi-point iterative methods, which can be used as a substitution\nfor the Newton-Raphson approach used by Hardy Cross, but in this case this\napproach did not reduce the number of iterations. Although many new models have\nbeen developed since the time of Hardy Cross, the main purpose of this paper is\nto illustrate the very beginning of modelling of gas and water pipe networks\nand ventilation systems.

One issue is that the fraction of baryons in the IGM,\n$f_{\\rm IGM}$, is not properly constrained. Here we propose a method of\nestimating $f_{\\rm IGM}$ using a putative sample of FRBs with the measurements\nof both DM and luminosity distance $d_{\\rm L}$. The latter can be obtained if\nthe FRB is associated with a distance indicator (e.g. a gamma-ray burst or a\ngravitational wave event), or the redshift $z$ of the FRB is measured and\n$d_{\\rm L}$ at the corresponding $z$ is available from other distance\nindicators (e.g. type Ia supernovae) at the same redshift. Since $d_{\\rm\nL}/{\\rm DM}$ essentially does not depend on cosmological parameters, our method\ncan determine $f_{\\rm IGM}$ independent of cosmological parameters. We\nparameterize $f_{\\rm IGM}$ as a function of redshift and model the DM\ncontribution from a host galaxy as a function of star formation rate. Assuming\n$f_{\\rm IGM}$ has a mild evolution with redshift with a functional form and by\nmeans of Monte Carlo simulations, we show that an unbiased and\ncosmology-independent estimate of the present value of $f_{\\rm IGM}$ with a\n$\\sim 12\\%$ uncertainty can be obtained with 50 joint measurements of $d_{\\rm\nL}$ and DM. In addition, such a method can also lead to a measurement of the\nmean value of DM contributed from the local host galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 06:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

To address these concerns, bivariate seemingly\nunrelated fixed and random parameter models are presented. With government test\ncycle ratings tending to over-estimate the actual on-road fuel economy, a\nsignificant variation is observed in the fuel economy gaps for the two vehicles\nacross garages. A wide variety of factors such as driving style, fuel economy\ncalculation method, and several vehicle specific characteristics are\nconsidered.

Given the anticipated\nwidespread deployment of UAVs for various purposes, it is imperative to develop\nnew security solutions against such attacks. In this paper, a mathematical\nframework is introduced for analyzing and mitigating the effects of GPS\nspoofing attacks on UAVs. In particular, system dynamics are used to model the\noptimal routes that the UAVs will adopt to reach their destinations. The GPS\nspoofer's effect on each UAV's route is also captured by the model. To this\nend, the spoofer's optimal imposed locations on the UAVs, are analytically\nderived; allowing the UAVs to predict their traveling routes under attack.\nThen, a countermeasure mechanism is developed to mitigate the effect of the GPS\nspoofing attack. The countermeasure is built on the premise of cooperative\nlocalization, in which a UAV can determine its location using nearby UAVs\ninstead of the possibly compromised GPS locations. To better utilize the\nproposed defense mechanism, a dynamic Stackelberg game is formulated to model\nthe interactions between a GPS spoofer and a drone operator. In particular, the\ndrone operator acts as the leader that determines its optimal strategy in light\nof the spoofer's expected response strategy. The equilibrium strategies of the\ngame are then analytically characterized and studied through a novel proposed\nalgorithm. Simulation results show that, when combined with the Stackelberg\nstrategies, the proposed defense mechanism will outperform baseline strategy\nselection techniques in terms of reducing the possibility of UAV capture\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 15:32:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 07:02:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Dec 2019 01:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

It is a\ndefined benefit plan and is often given as an alternative to a pension plan. In\nBotswana, there is now a new pattern whereby companies give their employees the\noption to receive their gratuity at various stages before the end of their\ncontracts. In particular, some companies give their employees an option to\nreceive their gratuity on a monthly basis rather than having them wait for a\nyear or more. Many employees find this option attractive, but is it\neconomically sound? This paper sheds light on this question by quantifying the\neconomic benefits of the tax relief provided by government relative to\ninvesting the monthly-received funds in a risk-free savings account or helping\nrepay a loan. The principles and methods used herein can be adapted and applied\nto different taxation systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 14:54:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 07:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-28"}

Taking into account such\nconstructs, aspects of which are apparent even with simple systems such as\nacoustically excited water (as with cymatics), potentially opens up a window\ninto a world of mentality excluded from conventional physics as a result of the\nprimary focus of the latter on the matter-like aspect of reality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 16:46:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 2019 17:04:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 16:55:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 17:02:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-28"}
