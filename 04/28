Up until now, polydimethylpolysiloxane (PDMS) sheets have\nbeen widely used for the dry release transfer of TMD materials. However, this\nmethod has been known to have limitations that make it difficult to transfer\nfew-layer-thick graphene and h-BN because of the difficulty to fabricate these\nmaterials on PDMS. As an alternative method, we demonstrate the dry release\ntransfer of single- and bi-layer graphene and few-layer h-BN in this study by\nutilizing poly(propylene) carbonate (PPC) films. Because of the strong adhesion\nbetween PPC and 2D materials around room temperature, we demonstrate that\nsingle- to few-layer graphene, as well as few-layer h-BN, can be fabricated on\na spin-coated PPC film/290-nm-thick SiO2/Si substrate via the mechanical\nexfoliation method. In addition, we show that these few-layer crystals are\nclearly distinguishable using an optical microscope with the help of optical\ninterference. Because of the thermoplastic properties of PPC film, the adhesion\nforce between the 2D materials and PPC significantly decreases at about 70\n{\\deg}C. Therefore, we demonstrate that single- to few-layer graphene, as well\nas few-layer h-BN flakes, on PPC can be easily dry-transferred onto another\nh-BN substrate. This method enables a multilayer van der Waals heterostructure\nto be constructed with a minimum amount of polymer contamination. We\ndemonstrate the fabrication of encapsulated h-BN/graphene/h-BN devices and\ngraphene/few-layer h-BN/graphene vertical-tunnel-junction devices using this\nmethod. Since devices fabricated by this method do not require an edge-contact\nscheme, our finding provide a simples method for constructing high-quality\ngraphene and h-BN-based van der Waals heterostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2019 16:08:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-21"}

All existing HSI-SR approaches require the LR HSI and\nHR MSI to be well registered and the reconstruction accuracy of the HR HSI\nrelies heavily on the registration accuracy of different modalities. This paper\nexploits the uncharted problem domain of HSI-SR without the requirement of\nmulti-modality registration. Given the unregistered LR HSI and HR MSI with\noverlapped regions, we design a unique unsupervised learning structure linking\nthe two unregistered modalities by projecting them into the same statistical\nspace through the same encoder. The mutual information (MI) is further adopted\nto capture the non-linear statistical dependencies between the representations\nfrom two modalities (carrying spatial information) and their raw inputs. By\nmaximizing the MI, spatial correlations between different modalities can be\nwell characterized to further reduce the spectral distortion. A collaborative\n$l_{2,1}$ norm is employed as the reconstruction error instead of the more\ncommon $l_2$ norm, so that individual pixels can be recovered as accurately as\npossible. With this design, the network allows to extract correlated spectral\nand spatial information from unregistered images that better preserves the\nspectral information. The proposed method is referred to as unregistered and\nunsupervised mutual Dirichlet Net ($u^2$-MDN).

At the same time, they support the propagation of quasi-TEM\ndispersive waves with which the magnetic flux non-linearly interact. In this\nwork, we study the properties of the electromagnetic resonances, under\ndifferent conditions of practical interest, in annular JTJs (AJTJs), in which\nthe wavelengths are limited to the length of the circumference divided by an\ninteger. Our analysis is based on perturbed sine-Gordon equations the\n(1+1)-dimensional space with periodic boundary conditions. We discuss the\ndiscrete modes of the travelling EM waves in circular annular JTJs in the\npresence of an in-plane magnetic field, as well as in the recently introduced\nconfocal annular JTJs (in the absence of magnetic field). In both cases, a\nvariable-separation method leads to quantitatively different Mathieu equations\ncharacterized by even and odd spatially periodic solutions with different\neigen-frequencies.

The ability to\nvisualize tissue in varied contrasts in the form of MR pulse sequences in a\nsingle scan provides valuable insights to physicians, as well as enabling\nautomated systems performing downstream analysis. However many issues like\nprohibitive scan time, image corruption, different acquisition protocols, or\nallergies to certain contrast materials may hinder the process of acquiring\nmultiple sequences for a patient. This poses challenges to both physicians and\nautomated systems since complementary information provided by the missing\nsequences is lost. In this paper, we propose a variant of generative\nadversarial network (GAN) capable of leveraging redundant information contained\nwithin multiple available sequences in order to generate one or more missing\nsequences for a patient scan.

While interpolation may give precise posterior\napproximations, deterministic quadrature is usually unable to efficiently\ninvestigate an informative and thus concentrated likelihood. This leads to a\nlarge number of required expensive evaluations of the mathematical model. To\novercome these challenges, we formulate and test a multilevel adaptive sparse\nLeja algorithm. At each level, adaptive sparse grid interpolation and\nquadrature are used to approximate the posterior and perform all quadrature\noperations, respectively. Specifically, our algorithm uses coarse\ndiscretizations of the underlying mathematical model to investigate the\nparameter space and to identify areas of high posterior probability. Adaptive\nsparse grid algorithms are then used to place points in these areas, and ignore\nother areas of small posterior probability. The points are weighted Leja\npoints. As the model discretization is coarse, the construction of the sparse\ngrid is computationally efficient. On this sparse grid, the posterior measure\ncan be approximated accurately with few expensive, fine model discretizations.\nThe efficiency of the algorithm can be enhanced further by exploiting more than\ntwo discretization levels.

While many of the data-race issues with concurrency can be\navoided by the placing of locks throughout the code, these often serialize\nprogram execution, and can significantly slow down performance-critical\napplications. Programmers also make mistakes, and often forget locks in\nless-executed code paths, which leads to programs that misbehave only in rare\nsituations.\n  Rust is a recent programming language from Mozilla that attempts to solve\nthese intertwined issues by detecting data-races at compile time. Rust's type\nsystem encodes a data-structure's ability to be shared between threads in the\ntype system, which in turn allows the compiler to reject programs where threads\ndirectly mutate shared state without locks or other protection mechanisms. In\nthis work, we examine how this aspect of Rust's type system impacts the\ndevelopment and refinement of a concurrent data structure, as well as its\nability to adapt to situations where correctness is guaranteed by lower-level\ninvariants (e.g., in lock-free algorithms) that are not directly expressible in\nthe type system itself. We detail the implementation of a concurrent lock-free\nhashmap in order to describe these traits of the Rust language.

In the context of OOD detection for image\nclassification, one of the recent approaches proposes training a classifier\ncalled \"confident-classifier\" by minimizing the standard cross-entropy loss on\nin-distribution samples and minimizing the KL divergence between the predictive\ndistribution of OOD samples in the low-density regions of in-distribution and\nthe uniform distribution (maximizing the entropy of the outputs). Thus, the\nsamples could be detected as OOD if they have low confidence or high entropy.\nIn this paper, we analyze this setting both theoretically and experimentally.\nWe conclude that the resulting confident-classifier still yields arbitrarily\nhigh confidence for OOD samples far away from the in-distribution.

However, this\ntrial-and-error process is often haphazard and time-consuming. To provide users\nwith an intuitive way to navigate the layout design space, we present a\ntechnique to systematically visualize a graph in diverse layouts using deep\ngenerative models. We design an encoder-decoder architecture to learn a model\nfrom a collection of example layouts, where the encoder represents training\nexamples in a latent space and the decoder produces layouts from the latent\nspace. In particular, we train the model to construct a two-dimensional latent\nspace for users to easily explore and generate various layouts.

The results of our evaluations show that our model is capable of\nlearning and generalizing abstract concepts of graph layouts, not just\nmemorizing the training examples.

As the algorithms become more sophisticated, we no longer\nonly need to differentiate simple mathematical functions, but have to deal with\ngeneral programs which encode complex transformations of data. This\ndissertation introduces three tools for addressing the challenges that arise\nwhen obtaining and applying the derivatives for complex graphics algorithms.\n  Traditionally, practitioners have been constrained to composing programs with\na limited set of operators, or hand-deriving derivatives. We extend the image\nprocessing language Halide with reverse-mode automatic differentiation, and the\nability to automatically optimize the gradient computations. This enables\nautomatic generation of the gradients of arbitrary Halide programs, at high\nperformance, with little programmer effort.\n  In 3D rendering, the gradient is required with respect to variables such as\ncamera parameters, geometry, and appearance. However, computing the gradient is\nchallenging because the rendering integral includes visibility terms that are\nnot differentiable. We introduce, to our knowledge, the first general-purpose\ndifferentiable ray tracer that solves the full rendering equation, while\ncorrectly taking the geometric discontinuities into account.\n  Finally, we demonstrate that the derivatives of light path throughput can\nalso be useful for guiding sampling in forward rendering. Simulating light\ntransport in the presence of multi-bounce glossy effects and motion in 3D\nrendering is challenging due to the hard-to-sample high-contribution areas. We\npresent a Markov Chain Monte Carlo rendering algorithm that extends Metropolis\nLight Transport by automatically and explicitly adapting to the local\nintegrand, thereby increasing sampling efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2019 23:43:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 May 2019 11:34:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-30"}

We introduce an efficient method for reinforcing shells, that is,\nadding material to the shell to increase its resilience to external loads. Our\ngoal is to produce a reinforcement structure of minimal weight. It has been\ndemonstrated that optimal reinforcement structures may be qualitatively\ndifferent, depending on external loads and surface shape. In some cases, it\nnaturally consists of discrete protruding ribs; in other cases, a smooth shell\nthickness variation allows to save more material.\n  Most previously proposed solutions, starting from classical Michell trusses,\nare not able to handle a full range of shells (e.g., are restricted to\nself-supporting structures) or are unable to reproduce this range of behaviors,\nresulting in suboptimal structures.\n  We propose a new method that works for any input surface with any load\nconfigurations, taking into account both in-plane (tensile/compression) and\nout-of-plane (bending) forces. By using a more precise volume model, we are\ncapable of producing optimized structures with the full range of qualitative\nbehaviors. Our method includes new algorithms for determining the layout of\nreinforcement structure elements, and an efficient algorithm to optimize their\nshape, minimizing a non-linear non-convex functional at a fraction of the cost\nand with better optimality compared to standard solvers.\n  We demonstrate the optimization results for a variety of shapes, and the\nimprovements it yields in the strength of 3D-printed objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2019 01:41:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

It consists of discovering subsequences\nhaving a high utility (importance) in sequences, referred to as high-utility\nsequential patterns (HUSPs). HUSPs can be applied to many real-life\napplications, such as market basket analysis, E-commerce recommendation,\nclick-stream analysis and scenic route planning. For example, in economics and\ntargeted marketing, understanding economic behavior of consumers is quite\nchallenging, such as finding credible and reliable information on product\nprofitability. Several algorithms have been proposed to address this problem by\nefficiently mining utility-based useful sequential patterns. Nevertheless, the\nperformance of these algorithms can be unsatisfying in terms of runtime and\nmemory usage due to the combinatorial explosion of the search space for low\nutility threshold and large databases. Hence, this paper proposes a more\nefficient algorithm for the task of high-utility sequential pattern mining,\ncalled HUSP-ULL. It utilizes a lexicographic sequence (LS)-tree and a\nutility-linked (UL)-list structure to fast discover HUSPs. Furthermore, two\npruning strategies are introduced in HUSP-ULL to obtain tight upper-bounds on\nthe utility of candidate sequences, and reduce the search space by pruning\nunpromising candidates early. Substantial experiments both on real-life and\nsynthetic datasets show that the proposed algorithm can effectively and\nefficiently discover the complete set of HUSPs and outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2019 03:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

We find that the inner\nedge of the habitable zone for more massive planets occurs at higher stellar\nirradiation, as found in previous one-dimensional simulations. We also\ndetermine the relative effects of varying planetary radius and surface gravity.\nIncreasing the planetary radius leads to a lower planetary albedo and warmer\nclimate, pushing the inner edge of the habitable zone to lower stellar\nirradiation.

This is because\nthe column mass of water vapor decreases with increasing gravity, leading to a\nreduction in the greenhouse effect. The effect of gravity on the outgoing\nlongwave radiation is stronger than the effect of radius on the planetary\nalbedo, so that increasing gravity and radius together causes the inner edge of\nthe habitable zone to move to higher stellar irradiation.

This is due to that the\nCLF's influence function has a upper bound which can alleviate the influence of\na single sample, especially the sample with a large noise, on estimating the\nresiduals. Furthermore, we theoretically prove the grouping effect of our\nproposed method, which means that highly correlated data can be grouped\ntogether. Finally, experimental results on five real datasets reveal that our\nproposed method outperforms several representative clustering methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2019 07:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

There are tensionless strings whenever two M5 branes coincide or\nwhenever an M5 brane approaches the M9 plane. These systems do not admit a\nlow-energy Lagrangian description so new techniques are desirable to shed light\non the physics of these phenomena. The 6-dimensional N=(1,0) world-volume\ntheory on the M5 branes is composed of massless vector, tensor, and hyper\nmultiplets, and has two branches of the vacuum moduli space where either the\nscalar fields in the tensor or hyper multiplets receive vacuum expectation\nvalues. Focusing on the Higgs branch of the low-energy theory, previous works\nsuggest the conjecture that a new Higgs branch arises whenever a BPS-string\nbecomes tensionless. Consequently, a single theory admits a multitude of Higgs\nbranches depending on the types of tensionless strings in the spectrum. The two\nmain phenomena discrete gauging and small E8 instanton transition can be\ntreated in a concise and effective manner by means of Coulomb branches of\n3-dimensional N=4 gauge theories. In this paper, a formalism is introduced that\nallows to derive a novel object from a brane configuration, called the magnetic\nquiver. The main features are as follows: (i) the 3d Coulomb branch of the\nmagnetic quiver yields the Higgs branch of the 6d system, (ii) all discrete\ngauging and E8 instanton transitions have an explicit brane realisation, and\n(iii) exceptional symmetries arise directly from brane configurations. The\nformalism facilitates the description of Higgs branches at finite and infinite\ngauge coupling as spaces of dressed monopole operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2019 10:09:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Aug 2019 07:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

This is typically associated with a difference in\ngalaxy bias, describing the relation between galaxy number density and dark\nmatter density, although observational effects such as magnification bias also\nplay a role. In this paper we show that the presence of a screened fifth force\nadds additional degrees of freedom to the correlation function, describing the\neffective coupling of the force to the two galaxy populations. These are also\nproperties of the galaxies' environments, but with different dependence in\ngeneral to galaxy bias. We derive the parity-breaking correlation function\nanalytically as a function of fifth-force strength and the two populations'\nfifth-force charges, and explore the result numerically using Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$\nas a toy model of chameleon screening. We find that screening gives rise to an\noctopole, which, in the absence of magnification bias, is not present in any\ngravity theory without screening and thus is a qualitatively distinct\nsignature. The modification to the dipole and octopole can be\n$\\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(100\\%)$ respectively at redshift $z\n\\gtrsim 0.5$ due to screening, but decreases towards lower redshift. The change\nin the background power spectrum in $f(R)$ theories induces a change in the\ndipole of roughly the same size, but dominant to the effect of screening at low\n$z$. While current data is insufficient to measure the parity-breaking dipole\nor octopole to the precision required to test these models, future surveys such\nas DESI, Euclid and SKA have the potential to probe screened fifth forces\nthrough the dipole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2019 12:10:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 14:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Among\nvarious consequences of this mixing model, one surprising result is that the\nsecond tetraquark with the spin-1 diquark configuration is more important for\nthe light nonet. In this work, we report that this result can be supported by\nthe QCD sum rule calculation.

For suitably tuned parameters this system realizes time\ncrystals of various periodicities for \\emph{all} initial states. The robustness\nagainst variations of the parameters is also discussed.

Very recent NMT\nmodels are based on Encoder-Decoder, where a deep LSTM based encoder is used to\nproject the source sentence to a fixed dimensional vector and then another deep\nLSTM decodes the target sentence from the vector. However there has been very\nlittle work on exploring architectures that have more than one layer in\nspace(i.e. in each time step). This paper examines the effectiveness of the\nsimple Recurrent Highway Networks(RHN) in NMT tasks. The model uses Recurrent\nHighway Neural Network in encoder and decoder, with attention .We also explore\nthe reconstructor model to improve adequacy. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof all three approaches on the IWSLT English-Vietnamese dataset. We see that\nRHN performs on par with LSTM based models and even better in some cases.We see\nthat deep RHN models are easy to train compared to deep LSTM based models\nbecause of highway connections. The paper also investigates the effects of\nincreasing recurrent depth in each time step.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2019 08:27:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

A common technique used when regressing a camera's pose from an image is\nto formulate the loss as a linear combination of positional and rotational mean\nsquared error (using tuned hyperparameters as coefficients). In this work we\nobserve that changes to rotation and position mutually affect the captured\nimage, and in order to improve performance, a pose regression network's loss\nfunction should include a term which combines the error of both of these\ncoupled quantities. Based on task specific observations and experimental\ntuning, we present said loss term, and create a new model by appending this\nloss term to the loss function of the pre-existing pose regression network\n`PoseNet'. We achieve improvements in the localization accuracy of the network\nfor indoor scenes; with decreases of up to 26.7% and 24.0% in the median\npositional and rotational error respectively, when compared to the default\nPoseNet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2019 05:47:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2019 13:06:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-30"}

It aims to encode\nhigh-dimensional data points to binary codes, hence the original\nhigh-dimensional metric space can be efficiently approximated via Hamming\nspace. However, most existing hashing methods adopted offline batch learning,\nwhich is not suitable to handle incremental datasets with streaming data or new\ninstances. In contrast, the robustness of the existing online hashing remains\nas an open problem, while the embedding of supervised/semantic information\nhardly boosts the performance of the online hashing, mainly due to the defect\nof unknown category numbers in supervised learning. In this paper, we proposed\nan online hashing scheme, termed Hadamard Codebook based Online Hashing (HCOH),\nwhich aims to solve the above problems towards robust and supervised online\nhashing. In particular, we first assign an appropriate high-dimensional binary\ncodes to each class label, which is generated randomly by Hadamard codes to\neach class label, which is generated randomly by Hadamard codes. Subsequently,\nLSH is adopted to reduce the length of such Hadamard codes in accordance with\nthe hash bits, which can adapt the predefined binary codes online, and\ntheoretically guarantee the semantic similarity. Finally, we consider the\nsetting of stochastic data acquisition, which facilitates our method to\nefficiently learn the corresponding hashing functions via stochastic gradient\ndescend (SGD) online. Notably, the proposed HCOH can be embedded with\nsupervised labels and it not limited to a predefined category number. Extensive\nexperiments on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate the merits of the\nproposed scheme over the state-of-the-art methods.

However, so far\nthe components of these models have to be trained separately and through a\nvariety of specialized training methods. This paper demonstrates the surprising\nfinding that models with the same precise parts can be instead efficiently\ntrained end-to-end through a genetic algorithm (GA), reaching a comparable\nperformance to the original world model by solving a challenging car racing\ntask. An analysis of the evolved visual and memory system indicates that they\ninclude a similar effective representation to the system trained through\ngradient descent. Additionally, in contrast to gradient descent methods that\nstruggle with discrete variables, GAs also work directly with such\nrepresentations, opening up opportunities for classical planning in latent\nspace.
