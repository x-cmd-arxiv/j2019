Our results show that taking this production mechanism into account\nsignificantly enhances the sensitivity compared to previous studies based on\ncoherent ALP production in primary proton-nucleus interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2019 16:37:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 14:22:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 08:11:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

To adjust for unobserved confounders, we\ndevelop the medical deconfounder, a machine learning algorithm that unbiasedly\nestimates treatment effects from EHRs.

We present a\nmultidimensional capacitive sensing technique that estimates the local pose of\na human limb in real time. A key benefit of this sensing method is that it can\nsense the limb through opaque materials, including fabrics and wet cloth. Our\nmethod uses a multielectrode capacitive sensor mounted to a robot's end\neffector. A neural network model estimates the position of the closest point on\na person's limb and the orientation of the limb's central axis relative to the\nsensor's frame of reference. These pose estimates enable the robot to move its\nend effector with respect to the limb using feedback control. We demonstrate\nthat a PR2 robot can use this approach with a custom six electrode capacitive\nsensor to assist with two activities of daily living-dressing and bathing.

When assisting with bathing, the robot moved\na soft wet washcloth to follow the contours of able-bodied participants' limbs,\ncleaning their surfaces.

In order to shed light on this important question, we study the\norigin of two very massive stars (VMS): the O2.5If*/WN6 star RFS7 ($\\sim$100\n$M_{\\odot}$), and the O3.5If* star RFS8 ($\\sim$70 $M_{\\odot}$), found within\n$\\approx$ 53 and 58 pc respectively from the Galactic massive young cluster NGC\n3603, using Gaia data. RFS7 is found to exhibit motions resembling a runaway\nstar from NGC 3603. This is now the most massive runaway star candidate known\nin the Milky Way. Although RFS8 also appears to move away from the cluster\ncore, it has proper-motion values that appear inconsistent with being a runaway\nfrom NGC 3603 at the $3\\sigma$ level (but with substantial uncertainties due to\ndistance and age). Furthermore, no evidence for a bow-shock or a cluster was\nfound surrounding RFS8 from available near-infrared photometry.

This optically thin assumption\nseems to be supported by recent DSHARP observations where the measured optical\ndepths of spatially resolved disks are mostly less than one. However, we point\nout that dust scattering can considerably reduce the emission from an optically\nthick region. If that scattering is ignored, the optical depth will be\nconsiderably underestimated. An optically thick disk with scattering can be\nmisidentified as an optically thin disk. Dust scattering in more inclined disks\ncan reduce the intensity even further, making the disk look even fainter. The\nmeasured optical depth of $\\sim$0.6 in several DSHARP disks can be naturally\nexplained by optically thick dust with an albedo of $\\sim$0.9 at 1.25 mm. Using\nthe DSHARP opacity, this albedo corresponds to a dust population with the\nmaximum grain size ($s_{max}$) of 0.1-1 mm. For optically thick scattering\ndisks, the measured spectral index $\\alpha$ can be either larger or smaller\nthan 2 depending on if the dust albedo increases or decreases with wavelength.\nUsing the DSHARP opacity, $\\alpha<2$ corresponds to $s_{max}$ of 0.03-0.3 mm.\nWe describe how this optically thick scattering scenario could explain the\nobserved scaling between submm continuum sizes and luminosities, and might help\nease the tension between the dust size constraints from polarization and dust\ncontinuum measurements. We suggest that a significant amount of disk mass can\nbe hidden from ALMA observations at short millimeter wavelengths.

Here, we take a median road: we\naim at identifying the potential benefits of combining datasets, when both\npopulation growth and predation processes are viewed as stochastic. We fit a\ndiscrete-time, stochastic predator-prey model of the Leslie type to simulated\ntime series of densities and kill rate data. Our model has both environmental\nstochasticity in the growth rates and interaction stochasticity, i.e., a\nstochastic functional response. We examine what the kill rate data brings to\nthe quality of the estimates, and whether estimation is possible (for various\ntime series lengths) solely with time series of population counts or biomass\ndata. Both Bayesian and frequentist estimation are performed, providing\nmultiple ways to check model identifiability. The Fisher Information Matrix\nsuggests that models with and without kill rate data are all identifiable,\nalthough correlations remain between parameters that belong to the same\nfunctional form. However, our results show that if the attractor is a fixed\npoint in the absence of stochasticity, identifying parameters in practice\nrequires kill rate data as a complement to the time series of population\ndensities, due to the relatively flat likelihood. Only noisy limit cycle\nattractors can be identified directly from population count data (as in inverse\nmodelling), although even in this case, adding kill rate data - including in\nsmall amounts - can make the estimates much more precise. Overall, we show that\nunder process stochasticity in interaction rates, interaction data might be\nessential to obtain identifiable dynamical models for multiple species. These\nresults may extend to other biotic interactions than predation, for which\nsimilar models combining interaction rates and population counts could be\ndeveloped.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2019 17:59:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 22:04:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 14:09:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

Here we\nexplore the possibility that surface magnetic spots might be caused by the\npresence of small envelope convective layers at or just below the stellar\nsurface, caused by recombination of H and He. Using 1D stellar evolution\ncalculations and assuming an equipartition dynamo, we make simple estimates of\nfield strength at the photosphere. For most models the largest effects are\ncaused by a convective layer driven by second helium ionization. While it is\ndifficult to predict the geometry of the magnetic field, we conclude that the\nmajority of intermediate-mass stars should have dynamo-generated magnetic\nfields of order a few gauss at the surface. These magnetic fields can appear at\nthe surface as bright spots, and cause photometric variability via rotational\nmodulation, which could also be wide-spread in A-stars.

Modern numerical simulations designed to model the\ndynamics of terrestrial planet formation systematically fail to replicate\nMercury; which possesses just 5% the mass of Earth and the highest orbital\neccentricity and inclination among the planets. However, Mercury's large\niron-rich core and low volatile inventory stand out among the inner planets,\nand seem to imply a violent collisional origin. Because most algorithms used\nfor simulating terrestrial accretion do not consider the effects of collisional\nfragmentation, it has been difficult to test these collisional hypotheses\nwithin the larger context of planet formation. Here, we analyze a large suite\nof terrestrial accretion models that account for the fragmentation of colliding\nbodies.

Furthermore, we perform an additional batch of simulations\ndesigned to specifically test the single giant impact origin scenario.

Progressive stochastic binarization also permits\nlocalized, dynamic accuracy control within a single network, thereby providing\na new tool for adaptively focusing computational attention.\n  We evaluate our method on networks of various architectures, already\npretrained on ImageNet. With representational costs comparable to previous\nschemes, we obtain accuracies close to the original floating point\nimplementation. This includes pruned networks, except the known special case of\ncertain types of separated convolutions. By focusing computational attention\nusing progressive sampling, we reduce inference costs on ImageNet further by a\nfactor of up to 33% (before network pruning).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2019 19:09:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-05"}

In\nthis paper we study the qualitative and quantitative formal modelling of\narchitectures applied on parametric component-based systems, that consist of an\nunknown number of instances of each component. Specifically, we introduce an\nextended propositional interaction logic and investigate its first-order level\nwhich serves as a formal language for the interactions of parametric systems.\nOur logics achieve to encode the execution order of interactions, which is a\nmain feature in several important architectures, as well as to model recursive\ninteractions. Moreover, we prove the decidability of equivalence,\nsatisfiability, and validity of first-order extended interaction logic\nformulas, and provide several examples of formulas describing well-known\narchitectures.

In\naddition, agents are strategic, so when the rules change, they will also change\ntheir actions. Existing methods (e.g. structural estimation, inverse\nreinforcement learning) make counterfactual predictions by constructing a model\nof the game, adding the assumption that agents' behavior comes from optimizing\ngiven some goals, and then inverting observed actions to learn agent's\nunderlying utility function (a.k.a. type).

Using GPUs to accelerate irregular graph algorithms is even\nmore difficult to be efficient, since GPU's highly structured SIMT architecture\nis not a natural fit for irregular applications. With lots of previous efforts\nspent on subtly mapping graph algorithms onto the GPU, the performance of graph\nprocessing on GPUs is still highly memory-latency bound, leading to low\nutilization of compute resources. Random memory accesses generated by the\nsparse graph data structure are the major causes of this significant memory\naccess latency. Simply applying the conventional cache blocking technique\nproposed for matrix computation have limited benefit due to the significant\noverhead on the GPU.

To integrate our scheme into state-of-the-art implementations\nwithout significant overhead, we coordinate TOCAB with load balancing\nstrategies by considering the sparsity of subgraphs. To enable cache blocking\nfor traversal-based algorithms, we consider the benefit and overhead in\ndifferent iterations with different working set sizes, and apply TOCAB for\ntopology-driven kernels in pull direction.

A wealth of pre-processing methods are available, and it is\noften up to trial-and-error or user experience to select the method which gives\nthe best results. This process can be incredibly time consuming and\ninconsistent for multiple operators.\n  In this study we detail a method to analyze the statistical variability\nwithin a set of training spectra and determine suitability to form a robust\nmodel. This allows us to selectively qualify or exclude a pre-processing\nmethod, predetermine robustness, and simultaneously identify the number of\ncomponents which will form the best predictive model.

A physical state in LQG is expected to\nbe a sum over graphical $SU(2)$ spin network states. By propagation we mean\nthat a quantum perturbation at one vertex of a spin network state propagates to\nvertices which are `many links away' thus yielding a new spin network state\nwhich is related to the old one by this propagation. A physical state encodes\npropagation if its spin network summands are related by propagation. Here we\nstudy propagation in an LQG quantization of Smolin's weak coupling limit of\nEuclidean Gravity based on graphical $U(1)^3$ `charge' network states. Building\non our earlier work on anomaly free quantum constraint actions for this system,\nwe analyse the extent to which physical states encode propagation. In\nparticular, we show that a slight modification of the constraint actions\nconstructed in our previous work leads to physical states which encode robust\npropagation. Under appropriate conditions, this propagation merges, seperates\nand entangles vertices of charge network states. The `electric' diffeomorphism\nconstraints introduced in prevous work play a key role in our considerations.\nThe main import of our work is that there are choices of quantum constraint\nconstructions through LQG methods which are consistent with vigorous\npropagation thus providing a counterpoint to Smolin's early observations on the\ndifficulties of propagation in the context of LQG type operator constructions.\nWhether the choices considered in this work are physically appropriate is an\nopen question worthy of further study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2019 21:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

We examined the characteristics of isolated intermediate drift bursts\n(IMDs) and their morphologies on dynamic spectra, in particular the positioning\nof emission and absorption ridges and the repetition rate of fiber groups.\nThese were compared with a model in order to determine the conditions under\nwhich the IMDs appear and exhibit the above characteristics. Methods. We\nanalyzed sixteen metric type IV events with embedded IMDs. The events were\nrecorded with the Artemis-JLS/SAO high resolution (10 ms cadence) receiver in\nthe 270-450MHz range with a frequency resolution of 1.4 MHz. We developed\ncross- and autocorrelation techniques to measure the duration, spectral width,\nand frequency drift of fiber bursts in 47 IMD groups. We also developed a\nsemi-automatic algorithm to track fibers on dynamic spectra. Results. We\ndistinguish six morphological groups of fibers, based on the relative position\nof the emission and absorption ridges. These included fibers with emission or\nabsorption ridges only, fibers with the absorption ridge at lower or higher\nfrequency than the emission, or with two absorption ridges above and below the\nemission or with two emission ridges were separated by an absorption ridge.\nSome borderline cases of IMDs with very high drift rate (~0.30 s-1) or very\nnarrow total bandwidth (~8 MHz) were recorded; among them a group of rope-like\nIMDs with fast repetition rate and relatively narrow total frequency extent.\nThe whistler hypothesis leads to reasonable magnetic field (~4.6 G), but the\nAlfven-wave hypothesis requires much higher field. We estimated the ratio of\nthe whistler to the cyclotron frequency, x, to be ~ 0.3 to 0.6 and the average\nfrequency scale along the loop of ~220Mm. We present empirical relations\nbetween fiber burst parameters and discuss their possible origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2019 22:49:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

At present, the vast majority of GCNs use a neighborhood\naggregation framework to learn a continuous and compact vector, then performing\na pooling operation to generalize graph embedding for the classification task.\nThese approaches have two disadvantages in the graph classification task:\n(1)when only the largest sub-graph structure ($k$-hop neighbor) is used for\nneighborhood aggregation, a large amount of early-stage information is lost\nduring the graph convolution step; (2) simple average/sum pooling or max\npooling utilized, which loses the characteristics of each node and the topology\nbetween nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called, dual\nattention graph convolutional networks (DAGCN) to address these problems. DAGCN\nautomatically learns the importance of neighbors at different hops using a\nnovel attention graph convolution layer, and then employs a second attention\ncomponent, a self-attention pooling layer, to generalize the graph\nrepresentation from the various aspects of a matrix graph embedding. The dual\nattention network is trained in an end-to-end manner for the graph\nclassification task. We compare our model with state-of-the-art graph kernels\nand other deep learning methods.

We present constraints on the mass transfer histories of two BSS-WD\nbinaries in the open cluster NGC 188, using WD temperatures and surface\ngravities measured with HST COS far-ultraviolet spectroscopy. Adopting a\nGaia-based cluster distance of $1847\\pm107$ pc, we determine that one system,\nWOCS 4540, formed through Case C mass transfer resulting in a CO-core white\ndwarf with $T_{\\text{eff}}=17000^{+140}_{-200}$ K and a $\\log\ng=7.80^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$, corresponding to a mass of $0.53^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$\n$M_{\\odot}$ and a cooling age of $105^{+6}_{-5}$ Myr. The other system, WOCS\n5379, formed through Case B mass transfer resulting in a He-core white dwarf\nwith $T_{\\text{eff}}=15500^{+170}_{-150}$ K and a $\\log\ng=7.50^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$, corresponding to a mass of $0.42^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$\n$M_{\\odot}$ and an age of $250^{+20}_{-20}$ Myr. The WD parameters are\nconsistent across four different cluster distance assumptions. We determine\npossible progenitor binary systems with a grid of accretion models using MESA,\nand investigate whether these systems would lead to stable or unstable mass\ntransfer. WOCS 4540 likely resulted from stable mass transfer during periastron\npassage in an eccentric binary system, while WOCS 5379 challenges our current\nunderstanding of the expected outcomes for mass transfer from red giant branch\nstars.

Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs)\nhave emerged as an effective approach in style transfer by adversarially\ntraining the generator to synthesize convincing counterfeits. However,\ntraditional GAN suffers from the mode collapse issue, resulting in unstable\ntraining and making style transfer quality difficult to guarantee. In addition,\nthe GAN generator is only compatible with one style, so a series of GANs must\nbe trained to provide users with choices to transfer more than one kind of\nstyle. In this paper, we focus on tackling these challenges and limitations to\nimprove style transfer. We propose adversarial gated networks (Gated GAN) to\ntransfer multiple styles in a single model. The generative networks have three\nmodules: an encoder, a gated transformer, and a decoder. Different styles can\nbe achieved by passing input images through different branches of the gated\ntransformer. To stabilize training, the encoder and decoder are combined as an\nautoencoder to reconstruct the input images. The discriminative networks are\nused to distinguish whether the input image is a stylized or genuine image. An\nauxiliary classifier is used to recognize the style categories of transferred\nimages, thereby helping the generative networks generate images in multiple\nstyles. In addition, Gated GAN makes it possible to explore a new style by\ninvestigating styles learned from artists or genres. Our extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the stability and effectiveness of the proposed model for\nmultistyle transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 01:20:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

Here we show, in an elementary\nway, that when quantum ergodicity is properly defined, it is, in fact,\nequivalent to ETH. In turn, ergodicity is equivalent to thermalization, thus\nimplying the equivalence of thermalization and ETH. This result previously\nappeared in [De Palma et al., Phys. Rev.

Related to that\nis the line of research concerned with speeding up static networks by\napproximating expensive parts of them with cheaper alternatives, while\npropagating information from previous frames. In this work we attempt to come\nup with generalisation of those methods, and instead of manually designing\ncontextual blocks that connect per-frame outputs, we propose a neural\narchitecture search solution, where the choice of operations together with\ntheir sequential arrangement are being predicted by a separate neural network.\nWe showcase that such generalisation leads to stable and accurate results\nacross common benchmarks, such as CityScapes and CamVid datasets. Importantly,\nthe proposed methodology takes only 2 GPU-days, finds high-performing cells and\ndoes not rely on the expensive optical flow computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 06:32:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-05"}

This energy models the state of an heterogeneous type II\nsupercon-ductor submitted to a magnetic field. We calculate the value of the\nfirst critical field which links the presence of vorticity defects with the\nintensity of the applied magnetic field. Then we prove a standard dependance of\nthe quantized vorticity defects with the intensity of the applied field. Our\nstudy includes the case of a London solution having several minima. The\nmacroscopic location of the vor-ticity defects is understood with the famous\nBethuel-Brezis-H{\\'e}lein renormalized energy. The mesoscopic location, i.e.,\nthe arrangement of the vorticity defects around the minima of the London\nsolution, is the same than in the homogenous case. The microscopic location is\nexactly the same than in the heterogeneous case without magnetic field. We also\ncompute the value of secondary critical fields that increment the quantized\nvorticity. 1. Introdution This article studies the pinning phenomenon in\ntype-II superconducting composites. Superconductivity is a property that\nappears in certain materials cooled below a critical temperature. These\nmaterials are called superconductors. Superconductivity is characterized by a\ntotal absence of electrical resistance and a perfect diamagnetism.\nUnfortunately, when the imposed conditions are too intense, superconductivity\nis destroyed in certain areas of the material called vorticity defects. We are\ninterested in type II superconductors which are characterized by the fact that\nthe vorticity defects first appear in small areas. Their number increases with\nthe intensity of the conditions imposed until filling the material. For\nexample, when the intensity h ex of an applied magnetic field exceeds a first\nthreshold, the first vorticity defects appear: the magnetic field begins to\npenetrate the superconductor. The penetration is done along thin wires and may\nmove resulting an energy dissipation. These motions may be limited by trapping\nthe vorticity defects in small areas. The behavior of a superconductor is\nmodeled by minimizers of a Ginzburg-Landau type energy. In order to study the\npresence of traps for the vorticity defects we consider an energy including a\npinning term that models impurities in the supercon-ductor. These impurities\nwould play the role of traps for the vorticity defects. We are thus lead to the\nsubject of this article: the type-II superconducting composites with\nimpurities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 07:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-05"}

In this work, we take\nadvantage of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) due to its capability of\ndistribution learning and propose a generic multi-agent probabilistic\nprediction and tracking framework which takes the interactions among multiple\nentities into account, in which all the entities are treated as a whole.\nHowever, since GAN is very hard to train, we make an empirical research and\npresent the relationship between training performance and hyperparameter values\nwith a numerical case study. The results imply that the proposed model can\ncapture both the mean, variance and multi-modalities of the groundtruth\ndistribution. Moreover, we apply the proposed approach to a real-world task of\nvehicle behavior prediction to demonstrate its effectiveness and accuracy. The\nresults illustrate that the proposed model trained by adversarial learning can\nachieve a better prediction performance than other state-of-the-art models\ntrained by traditional supervised learning which maximizes the data likelihood.\nThe well-trained model can also be utilized as an implicit proposal\ndistribution for particle filtered based Bayesian state estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 07:41:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-05"}

As long as this predicted\ncompositional stratification can at least partially be preserved over the\nsubsequent billions of years of Earth mantle convection, the compositional\nsimilarity between the Moon and the accessible Earth's mantle is a natural\noutcome of realistic and high-probability Moon-forming impact scenarios. The\npreservation of primordial heterogeneity in the modern Earth not only\nreconciles geochemical constraints but is also consistent with recent\ngeophysical observations. Furthermore, for significant preservation of a\nproto-Earth reservoir, the bulk composition of the Earth-Moon system may be\nsystematically shifted towards chondritic values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 08:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Understanding the disk properties and\ntheir correlation with those of the central star is critical to understand\nplanet formation. In particular, a decrease of the average measured disk dust\nmass with the age of the region has been observed. We conducted\nhigh-sensitivity continuum ALMA observations of 43 Class II young stellar\nobjects in CrA at 1.3 mm (230 GHz). The typical spatial resolution is 0.3\". The\ncontinuum fluxes are used to estimate the dust masses of the disks, and a\nsurvival analysis is performed to estimate the average dust mass. We also\nobtained new VLT/X-Shooter spectra for 12 of the objects in our sample. 24\ndisks are detected, and stringent limits have been put on the average dust mass\nof the non-detections. Accounting for the upper limits, the average disk mass\nin CrA is $6\\pm3\\,\\rm M_\\oplus$, significantly lower than that of disks in\nother young (1-3 Myr) star forming regions (e.g. Lupus) and appears consistent\nwith the 5-10 Myr old Upper Sco. The position of the stars in our sample on the\nHR diagram, however, seems to confirm that that CrA has age similar to Lupus.\nNeither external photoevaporation nor a lower than usual stellar mass\ndistribution can explain the low disk masses. On the other hand, a low-mass\ndisk population could be explained if the disks are small, which could happen\nif the parent cloud has a low temperature or intrinsic angular momentum, or if\nthe the angular momentum of the cloud is removed by some physical mechanism\nsuch as magnetic braking. In order to fully explain and understand the dust\nmass distribution of protoplanetary disks and their evolution, it may also be\nnecessary to take into consideration the initial conditions of star and disk\nformation process, which may vary from region to region, and affect planet\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 08:47:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

Generative adversarial network (GAN) has been proposed to handle\nthe case. With its strong generative ability, it only needs to learn the\ndistribution of normal status, and identify the abnormal status through the gap\nbetween it and the learned distribution.

However, almost all existing methods\nemploying cross-modal hashing cannot obtain powerful hash codes due to their\nignoring the relative similarity between heterogeneous data that contains\nricher semantic information, leading to unsatisfactory retrieval performance.\nIn this paper, we propose a triplet-based deep hashing (TDH) network for\ncross-modal retrieval. First, we utilize the triplet labels, which describes\nthe relative relationships among three instances as supervision in order to\ncapture more general semantic correlations between cross-modal instances. We\nthen establish a loss function from the inter-modal view and the intra-modal\nview to boost the discriminative abilities of the hash codes. Finally, graph\nregularization is introduced into our proposed TDH method to preserve the\noriginal semantic similarity between hash codes in Hamming space.

After that,\nwe investigate the IDE models to illustrate the tension between the results of\nExperiment to Detect the Global Epoch of reionization Signature (EDGES) and\nother experiments. To apply the analyses of these two mechanisms to IDE models,\nwe find that only the optical depth can be significantly changed. Accordingly,\nin order to relieve the tension by including the effects of the decoupling time\nof Compton scattering heating, we deduce a possible evolution form for the\nHubble parameter within IDE that begins at an early stage around $z\\sim 100$\nand then smoothly evolves to a value at $z\\sim 17$ which is smaller than that\nobtained in the standard paradigm. Eventually, we fulfill this scenario by\nadding an early dark energy dominated stage to the cosmological paradigm\ndescribed by IDE models, which can alleviate the tension between EDGES and\nother cosmological observations but cannot completely solve it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 10:23:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 11:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-19"}

However, the problem of the representation of a\ntwo-spin coupling system on a Bloch sphere has not been solved satisfactorily\nyet. Here, we present a practical method to resolve the problem for the\nmixed-spin $(s, 1/2)$ system. The system can be decomposed into two spins:\nspin-$(s+1/2)$ and spin-$(s-1/2)$ at the coupling bases, which can be regarded\nas independent spins. Besides, we may write any pure state as a superposition\nof two orthonormal states with one spin-$(s+1/2)$ state and the other\nspin-$(s-1/2)$ state. Thus, the whole state can be regarded as a state of a\npseudo spin-$1/2$. In this way, the mixed spin decomposes into three spins.\nTherefore, we can represent the state by $(2s+1)+(2s-1)+1=4s+1$ sets of stars\non a Bloch sphere. Finally, to demonstrate our theory, we give some examples\nthat indeed show laconic and symmetric patterns on the Bloch sphere, and unveil\nthe properties of the high-spin system by analyzing the trajectories of the\nMajorana stars on a Bloch sphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 10:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-05"}

A challenge is dealing with phonons that\nbackreflect from the substrate lower boundary, as these will artificially\nreduce the friction FR acting on the sliding bead. One proposed solution is to\nuse a Langevin thermostat, operating at temperature TLAN, and with the\ncorresponding damping parameter, GAMMA, optimally tuned such that FR is\nmaximized [Benassi etal, PHYSREVB, V82, P081401, 2010]. In this paper, the\nmethod is revisited, and related to the substrate phonon lifetime, the\nsubstrate temperature TSUB, and the sliding speed. At low sliding speed, where\nthe time between stick-slip events is large compared to the phonon lifetime, we\ndo not observe much dependence of FR on GAMMA, and here thermostat tuning is\nnot required. At high sliding speed, upon varying GAMMA, we confirm the\naforementioned friction maximum, but also observe a pronounced minimum in TSUB,\nwhich here deviates from TLAN. For substrate particle interactions that are\nstrongly anharmonic, the variation of FR with GAMMA can be understood as a\nmanifestation of thermolubricity, backreflections being essentially\nunimportant. In contrast, for harmonic interactions, where phonon lifetimes\nbecome very long, FR is strongly affected by backreflecting phonons, though not\nenough to overturn thermolubricity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 10:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

The whole mechanism\nis differentiable end-to-end, allowing the network to learn how to utilise this\nlong-term memory via stochastic gradient descent. This allows NTMs to infer\nsimple algorithms directly from data sequences. Nonetheless, the model can be\nhard to train due to a large number of parameters and interacting components\nand little related work is present. In this work we use NTMs to learn and\ngeneralise two arithmetical tasks: binary addition and multiplication.

Ship waves for motion across a sub--surface\ncurrent on a still surface exhibit striking asymmetry about the ship's line of\nmotion, and large differences in wake angle and transverse wavelength for\nupstream vs downstream motion are demonstrated, all of which in good agreement\nwith theoretical predictions.

The Total Lagrangian SPH (TLSPH) is free of this instability as\nthe kernel functions are calculated in the reference configurations.

The\nprocessing/cutting tools are modelled as rigid bodies, while the metal-tool\ncontact forces are considered using the standard SPH interaction and the\nparticle-particle pinball contact in ESPH and TLSPH, respectively.

This work opens up the\nopportunity for large-scale manufacturing that can be applied to a range of\nmaterials, including polymers and other flexible substrates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 13:17:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-05"}

However, challenges such as occlusion and view change remain\nobstacles in real world deployment. A natural solution to these challenges is\nto use multiple cameras with multiview inputs, though existing systems are\nmostly limited to specific targets (e.g. human), static cameras, and/or camera\ncalibration. To break through these limitations, we propose a generic multiview\ntracking (GMT) framework that allows camera movement, while requiring neither\nspecific object model nor camera calibration. A key innovation in our framework\nis a cross-camera trajectory prediction network (TPN), which implicitly and\ndynamically encodes camera geometric relations, and hence addresses missing\ntarget issues such as occlusion. Moreover, during tracking, we assemble\ninformation across different cameras to dynamically update a novel\ncollaborative correlation filter (CCF), which is shared among cameras to\nachieve robustness against view change. The two components are integrated into\na correlation filter tracking framework, where the features are trained offline\nusing existing single view tracking datasets. For evaluation, we first\ncontribute a new generic multiview tracking dataset (GMTD) with careful\nannotations, and then run experiments on GMTD and the PETS2009 datasets.

Still, many MF algorithms do\nnot adequately scale with the size of available datasets and/or lack\ninterpretability. To improve the computational efficiency of the method, an\nonline (streaming) MF algorithm was proposed in Mairal et al. [2010]. To enable\ndata interpretability, a constrained version of MF, termed convex MF, was\nintroduced in Ding et al. [2010]. In the latter work, the basis vectors are\nrequired to lie in the convex hull of the data samples, thereby ensuring that\nevery basis can be interpreted as a weighted combination of data samples. No\ncurrent algorithmic solutions for online convex MF are known as it is\nchallenging to find adequate convex bases without having access to the complete\ndataset. We address both problems by proposing the first online convex MF\nalgorithm that maintains a collection of constant-size sets of representative\ndata samples needed for interpreting each of the basis (Ding et al. [2010]) and\nhas the same almost sure convergence guarantees as the online learning\nalgorithm of Mairal et al. [2010]. Our proof techniques combine random\ncoordinate descent algorithms with specialized quasi-martingale convergence\nanalysis. Experiments on synthetic and real world datasets show significant\ncomputational savings of the proposed online convex MF method compared to\nclassical convex MF.

The study of planning in\nthese scenarios is crucial as these environments often cover the first or the\nlast one kilometer of a daily travel or logistic system. Additionally, it is\nessential to treat these scenarios differently as, in most cases, the driving\nenvironment is narrow, dynamic, and rich with obstacles, which also causes the\nplanning in such environments to continue to be a challenging task. This paper\nproposes a hierarchical planning approach that separates the path planning and\nthe temporal planning.

A number of deep metric learning methods, which ensure that similar\nexamples are mapped close to each other and dissimilar examples are mapped\nfarther apart, have been proposed to construct effective structures for loss\nfunctions and have shown promising results. In this paper, different from the\napproaches on learning the loss structures, we propose a robust SNR distance\nmetric based on Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for measuring the similarity of\nimage pairs for deep metric learning. By exploring the properties of our SNR\ndistance metric from the view of geometry space and statistical theory, we\nanalyze the properties of our metric and show that it can preserve the semantic\nsimilarity between image pairs, which well justify its suitability for deep\nmetric learning. Compared with Euclidean distance metric, our SNR distance\nmetric can further jointly reduce the intra-class distances and enlarge the\ninter-class distances for learned features.

Inspired by machine translation, recent models tackle\nthis task using an encoder-decoder strategy. The (video) encoder is\ntraditionally a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), while the decoding (for\nlanguage generation) is done using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Current\nstate-of-the-art methods, however, train encoder and decoder separately. CNNs\nare pretrained on object and/or action recognition tasks and used to encode\nvideo-level features.

Our results show that transferring\ninformation on the most influential configuration options and their\ninteractions is an effective way of reducing the cost to build performance\nmodels in new environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 14:16:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-08"}

Most existing few-shot learning approaches belong\nto either metric-based meta-learning or optimization-based meta-learning\ncategory, both of which have achieved successes in the simplified \"$k$-shot\n$N$-way\" image classification settings. Specifically, the optimization-based\napproaches train a meta-learner to predict the parameters of the task-specific\nclassifiers. The task-specific classifiers are required to be\nhomogeneous-structured to ease the parameter prediction, so the meta-learning\napproaches could only handle few-shot learning problems where the tasks share a\nuniform number of classes. The metric-based approaches learn one task-invariant\nmetric for all the tasks. Even though the metric-learning approaches allow\ndifferent numbers of classes, they require the tasks all coming from a similar\ndomain such that there exists a uniform metric that could work across tasks. In\nthis work, we propose a hybrid meta-learning model called Meta-Metric-Learner\nwhich combines the merits of both optimization- and metric-based approaches.\nOur meta-metric-learning approach consists of two components, a task-specific\nmetric-based learner as a base model, and a meta-learner that learns and\nspecifies the base model. Thus our model is able to handle flexible numbers of\nclasses as well as generate more generalized metrics for classification across\ntasks. We test our approach in the standard \"$k$-shot $N$-way\" few-shot\nlearning setting following previous works and a new realistic few-shot setting\nwith flexible class numbers in both single-source form and multi-source forms.\nExperiments show that our approach can obtain superior performance in all\nsettings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 07:31:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 01:35:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

Besides being\nhighly valuable, its value has also experienced a steep increase, from around 1\ndollar in 2010 to around 18000 in 2017. Then, in recent years, it has attracted\nconsiderable attention in a diverse set of fields, including economics and\ncomputer science. The former mainly focuses on studying how it affects the\nmarket, determining reasons behinds its price fluctuations, and predicting its\nfuture prices. The latter mainly focuses on its vulnerabilities, scalability,\nand other techno-crypto-economic issues. Here, we aim at revealing the\nusefulness of traditional autoregressive integrative moving average (ARIMA)\nmodel in predicting the future value of bitcoin by analyzing the price time\nseries in a 3-years-long time period. On the one hand, our empirical studies\nreveal that this simple scheme is efficient in sub-periods in which the\nbehavior of the time-series is almost unchanged, especially when it is used for\nshort-term prediction, e.g. 1-day. On the other hand, when we try to train the\nARIMA model to a 3-years-long period, during which the bitcoin price has\nexperienced different behaviors, or when we try to use it for a long-term\nprediction, we observe that it introduces large prediction errors. Especially,\nthe ARIMA model is unable to capture the sharp fluctuations in the price, e.g.\nthe volatility at the end of 2017. Then, it calls for more features to be\nextracted and used along with the price for a more accurate prediction of the\nprice. We have further investigated the bitcoin price prediction using an ARIMA\nmodel, trained over a large dataset, and a limited test window of the bitcoin\nprice, with length $w$, as inputs. Our study sheds lights on the interaction of\nthe prediction accuracy, choice of ($p,q,d$), and window size $w$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 12:18:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-11"}

In contrast to direct\nacquisition of three-dimensional (3D) images of such medium, obtaining its\nsub-region (s) like two-dimensional (2D) images or several small areas could be\nmuch feasible. Therefore, reconstructing whole images from the limited\ninformation is a primary technique in such cases. Specially, in practice the\ngiven data cannot generally be determined by users and may be incomplete or\npartially informed, thus making existing reconstruction methods inaccurate or\neven ineffective. To overcome this shortcoming, in this study we proposed a\ndeep learning-based framework for reconstructing full image from its much\nsmaller sub-area(s). Particularly, conditional generative adversarial network\n(CGAN) is utilized to learn the mapping between input (partial image) and\noutput (full image). To preserve the reconstruction accuracy, two simple but\neffective objective functions are proposed and then coupled with the other two\nfunctions to jointly constrain the training procedure. Due to the inherent\nessence of this ill-posed problem, a Gaussian noise is introduced for producing\nreconstruction diversity, thus allowing for providing multiple candidate\noutputs. Extensively tested on a variety of porous materials and demonstrated\nby both visual inspection and quantitative comparison, the method is shown to\nbe accurate, stable yet fast ($\\sim0.08s$ for a $128 \\times 128$ image\nreconstruction).
