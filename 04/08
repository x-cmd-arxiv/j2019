The intrinsic\ninterdependency among these systems may exert underlying influence on both\ndesign and operation of the heterogeneous infrastructures. However, few prior\nstudies have tapped into the interdependency among the three systems in order\nto quantify their potential impacts during standard operation. In response to\nthis, this paper proposes an open source, flexible, integrated modeling\nframework suitable for designing coupled energy, transportation, and\ncommunication systems and for assessing the impact of their interdependencies.\nFirst, a novel multi-level, multi-layer, multi-agent approach is proposed to\nenable flexible modeling of the interconnected energy, transportation, and\ncommunication systems. Then, for the framework's proof-of-concept, preliminary\ncomponent and system-level models for different systems are designed and\nimplemented using Modelica, an equation-based object-oriented modeling\nlanguage. Finally, three case studies of gradually increasing complexity are\npresented (energy, energy + transportation, energy + transportation +\ncommunication) to evaluate the interdependencies among the three systems.\nQuantitative analyses show that the deviation of the average velocity on the\nroad can be 10.5\\% and the deviation of the power draw from the grid can be 7\\%\nwith or without considering the transportation and communication system at the\npeak commute time, indicating the presence of notable interdependencies. The\nproposed modeling framework also has the potential to be further extended for\nvarious modeling purposes and use cases, such as dynamic modeling and\noptimization, resilience analysis, and integrated decision making in future\nconnected communities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 2019 16:06:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

The sample was selected from the Swift/BAT nine month\ncatalog. We use high angular resolution nuclear infrared (IR) photometry and\nN-band spectroscopy, the CLUMPY torus models and a Bayesian tool to\ncharacterize the properties of the nuclear dust. In the case of the Sy1s we\nestimate the accretion disk contribution to the subarcsecond resolution nuclear\nIR SEDs (~0.4'') which is, on average, 46+-28, 23+-13 and 11+-5% in the J-, H-\nand K-bands, respectively. This indicates that the accretion disk templates\nthat assume a steep fall for longer wavelengths than 1 micron might\nunderestimate its contribution to the near-IR emission. Using both optical\n(broad vs narrow lines) and X-ray (unabsorbed vs absorbed) classifications, we\ncompare the global posterior distribution of the torus model parameters. We\nconfirm that Sy2s have larger values of the torus covering factor (CT~0.95)\nthan Sy1s (CT~0.65) in our volume-limited Seyfert sample. These findings are\nindependent of whether we use an optical or X-ray classification. We find that\nthe torus covering factor remains essentially constant within the errors in our\nluminosity range and there is no clear dependence with the Eddington ratio.\nFinally, we find tentative evidence that even an ultra hard X-ray selection is\nmissing a significant fraction of highly absorbed type 2 sources with very high\ncovering factor tori.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 2019 17:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

Concurrency control is the main challenge while designing a correct and\nefficient concurrent program.

The main idea behind the method is\nto treat each bead as a dumb-bell, i.e. two sub-beads (the sub-beads can bear\ncharges) kept at a fixed distance, instead of a point-like particle. It was\nshown that at small enough separations the composite beads act essentially as\nconventional point-like beads. Next, the relation between the bead dipole\nmoment and the bulk dielectric permittivity was obtained. The interaction of\nsingle charges in polar liquid showed that the observed dielectric permittivity\nis somewhat smaller than that obtained for the bulk case at large separation\nbetween the charges; at distances comparable to the bead size the solvation\nshells of the charges start to interfere and oscillations in the observed\npermittivity occur. Such oriented molecules effectively have smaller\npolarizability compared to the bulk liquid, so the field of one charge in the\nvicinity of another charge is reduced not as strong as in the bulk. Finally, we\nshowed why it is necessary to treat the polar species in DPD explicitly instead\nof implicitly by calculating the local polarizability based on the local\nspecies concentrations: the latter leads to the violation of the Newton's third\nlaw resulting in simulation artifacts.

One particular formulation of quantum dynamics advocated\nhere is in the form of a machine learning simulator of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation. If combined with the Bayesian statistics, such a simulator allows one\nto obtain not only the quantum predictions but also the error bars of the\ndynamical results associated with uncertainties of inputs (such as the\npotential energy surface or non-adiabatic couplings) into the nuclear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation. Instead of viewing atoms as undergoing dynamics on a\ngiven potential energy surface, Bayesian machine learning allows one to\nformulate the problem as the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with a non-parametric\ndistribution of potential energy surfaces that becomes conditioned by the\ndesired dynamical properties (such as the experimental measurements). Machine\nlearning models of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation solutions can identify the\nsensitivity of the dynamical properties to different parts of the potential\nsurface, the collision energy, angular momentum, external field parameters and\nbasis sets used for the calculations. This can be used to inform the design of\nefficient quantum dynamics calculations. Machine learning models can also be\nused to correlate rigorous results with approximate calculations, providing\naccurate interpolation of exact results. Finally, there is evidence that it is\npossible to build Bayesian machine learning models capable of physically\nextrapolating the solutions of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation.

In particular, so-called\nadversarial examples, constructed from perturbations of input data that are\nsmall or imperceptible to humans but lead to different predictions, may lead to\nan enormous risk in certain critical applications. In light of this, there has\nbeen a great deal of work on developing adversarial training strategies to\nimprove model robustness. These training strategies are very expensive, in both\nhuman and computational time. To complement these approaches, we propose a very\nsimple and inexpensive strategy which can be used to ``retrofit'' a\npreviously-trained network to improve its resilience to adversarial attacks.\nMore concretely, we propose a new activation function---the JumpReLU---which,\nwhen used in place of a ReLU in an already-trained model, leads to a trade-off\nbetween predictive accuracy and robustness. This trade-off is controlled by the\njump size, a hyper-parameter which can be tuned during the validation stage.\nOur empirical results demonstrate that this increases model robustness,\nprotecting against adversarial attacks with substantially increased levels of\nperturbations. This is accomplished simply by retrofitting existing networks\nwith our JumpReLU activation function, without the need for retraining the\nmodel. Additionally, we demonstrate that adversarially trained (robust) models\ncan greatly benefit from retrofitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 2019 21:47:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

Based on\nmatrix reduction, this algorithm is a cornerstone of the emergent area of\ntopological data analysis. Its input is a simplicial filtration defined over\nthe integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ giving rise to a $1$-parameter persistence module. It\nhas been recognized that multiparameter version of persistence modules given by\nsimplicial filtrations over $d$-dimensional integer grids $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ is\nequally or perhaps more important in data science applications. However, in the\nmultiparameter setting, one of the main challenges is that topological\nsummaries based on algebraic structure such as decompositions and bottleneck\ndistances cannot be as efficiently computed as in the $1$-parameter case\nbecause there is no known extension of the persistence algorithm to\nmultiparameter persistence modules. We present an efficient algorithm to\ncompute the unique decomposition of a finitely presented persistence module $M$\ndefined over the multiparameter $\\mathbb{Z}^d$.

In particular, 1-bit matrix completion, which considers\nthe prediction as a ``Recommended'' or ``Not Recommended'' question, has proved\nits significance and validity in the field. However, while customers and\nproducts aggregate into interacted clusters, state-of-the-art model-based 1-bit\nrecommender systems do not take the consideration of grouping bias. To tackle\nthe gap, this paper introduced Group-Specific 1-bit Matrix Completion (GS1MC)\nby first-time consolidating group-specific effects into 1-bit recommender\nsystems under the low-rank latent variable framework. Additionally, to empower\nGS1MC even when grouping information is unobtainable, Cluster Developing Matrix\nCompletion (CDMC) was proposed by integrating the sparse subspace clustering\ntechnique into GS1MC. Namely, CDMC allows clustering users/items and to\nleverage their group effects into matrix completion at the same time.\nExperiments on synthetic and real-world data show that GS1MC outperforms the\ncurrent 1-bit matrix completion methods. Meanwhile, it is compelling that CDMC\ncan successfully capture items' genre features only based on sparse binary\nuser-item interactive data. Notably, GS1MC provides a new insight to\nincorporate and evaluate the efficacy of clustering methods while CDMC can be\nserved as a new tool to explore unrevealed social behavior or market\nphenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 2019 23:50:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

Thus the paper opens new topics in Geometric Function Theory with\nconnections to mathematical models of Nonlinear Elasticity. In seeking\ndifferences and similarities with quasiconformal mappings we examine closely\nthe modulus of continuity of deformations of bi-conformal energy. This leads us\nto a new characterization of quasiconformality. Specifically, it is observed\nthat quasiconformal mappings behave locally at every point like radial\nstretchings. Without going into detail, if a quasiconformal map $h$ admits a\nfunction $\\phi$ as its optimal modulus of continuity at a point $x_0$, then $f\n= h^{-1}$ admits the inverse function $\\psi = \\phi^{-1}$ as its modulus of\ncontinuity at $y_0 = h(x_0)$. That is to say; a poor continuity of $h$ at a\ngiven point $x_0$ is always compensated by a better continuity of $f$ at $y_0$,\nand vice versa. Such a gain/loss property, seemingly overlooked by many\nauthors, is actually characteristic of quasiconformal mappings.\n  It turns out that the elastic deformations of bi-conformal energy are very\ndifferent in this respect. Unexpectedly, such a map may have the same optimal\nmodulus of continuity as its inverse deformation. In line with Hooke's Law,\nwhen trying to restore the original shape of the body (by the inverse\ntransformation) the modulus of continuity may neither be improved nor become\nworse. However, examples to confirm this phenomenon are far from being obvious.\nWe eventually hope that our examples will gain an interest in the materials\nscience, particularly in mathematical models of hyperelasticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 01:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

It was shown that, given only the observed record,\nthe observer can better estimate the underlying true quantum states, by\ninferring the unobserved record and using quantum state smoothing, rather than\nthe usual quantum filtering approach.

Motivated by\nsome recent developments on beyond worst-case analysis, we introduce the notion\nof stability for MEB (with outliers), which is natural and easy to understand.\nRoughly speaking, an instance of MEB is stable, if the radius of the resulting\nball cannot be significantly reduced by removing a small fraction of the input\npoints. Under the stability assumption, we present two sampling algorithms for\ncomputing approximate MEB with sample complexities independent of the number of\ninput points $n$. In particular, the second algorithm has the sample complexity\neven independent of the dimensionality $d$. Further, we extend the idea to\nachieve a sub-linear time approximation algorithm for the MEB with outliers\nproblem.

Event rates of neutrino-pair emission, when the mechanism of\nmacroscopic coherence amplification works, may become large enough for\nrealistic experiments by carefully selecting certain types of target atoms or\nions doped in crystals.

To remedy\nabove defects, this paper proposes a novel propagation algorithm called hybrid\ndiffusion under ensemble teaching (HyDEnT). Specifically, HyDEnT integrates\nmultiple propagation methods as base learners to fully exploit their individual\nwisdom, which helps HyDEnT to be stable and obtain consistent encouraging\nresults. More importantly, HyDEnT conducts propagation under the guidance of an\nensemble of teachers.

This is accomplished\nby a designed optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved via the\nblock coordinate descent method.

Hence,\nfor a video, there could be multiple video-level labels. We cast this weakly\nsupervised person re-id challenge into a multi-instance multi-label learning\n(MIML) problem. In particular, we develop a Cross-View MIML (CV-MIML) method\nthat is able to explore potential intraclass person images from all the camera\nviews by incorporating the intra-bag alignment and the cross-view bag\nalignment. Finally, the CV-MIML method is embedded into an existing deep neural\nnetwork for developing the Deep Cross-View MIML (Deep CV-MIML) model. We have\nperformed extensive experiments to show the feasibility of the proposed weakly\nsupervised setting and verify the effectiveness of our method compared to\nrelated methods on four weakly labeled datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 04:21:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 00:46:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

To learn a robust distance metric for a target task, we\nneed abundant side information (i.e., the similarity/dissimilarity pairwise\nconstraints over the labeled data), which is usually unavailable in practice\ndue to the high labeling cost. This paper considers the transfer learning\nsetting by exploiting the large quantity of side information from certain\nrelated, but different source tasks to help with target metric learning (with\nonly a little side information). The state-of-the-art metric learning\nalgorithms usually fail in this setting because the data distributions of the\nsource task and target task are often quite different. We address this problem\nby assuming that the target distance metric lies in the space spanned by the\neigenvectors of the source metrics (or other randomly generated bases). The\ntarget metric is represented as a combination of the base metrics, which are\ncomputed using the decomposed components of the source metrics (or simply a set\nof random bases); we call the proposed method, decomposition-based transfer DML\n(DTDML). In particular, DTDML learns a sparse combination of the base metrics\nto construct the target metric by forcing the target metric to be close to an\nintegration of the source metrics. The main advantage of the proposed method\ncompared with existing transfer metric learning approaches is that we directly\nlearn the base metric coefficients instead of the target metric. To this end,\nfar fewer variables need to be learned. We therefore obtain more reliable\nsolutions given the limited side information and the optimization tends to be\nfaster.

Our level-$\\ell$ algorithm\ncan be thought of as a linearized message-passing algorithm that keeps track of\n$\\ell$-wise dependencies among the hidden variables. Specifically, our\nalgorithms are spectral methods based on the Kikuchi Hessian, which generalizes\nthe well-studied Bethe Hessian to the higher-order Kikuchi free energies.\n  It is known that AMP, the flagship algorithm of statistical physics, has\nsubstantially worse performance than SOS for tensor PCA.

Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations\non both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method,\nwhich outperforms state-of-the-art stereo matching, depth completion and\nLidar-Stereo fusion approaches significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 07:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

However, this\nmaximum size is considerably smaller than anticipated from dust evolution\nmodels that assume a high sticking efficiency for icy particles. Here, we\npropose that the unexpectedly small particle size can be explained if CO$_2$\nice covers the particles in the outer region of the HL Tau disk. CO$_2$ ice is\none of the most major interstellar ices, and laboratory experiments show that\nit is poorly sticky. Based on dust evolution models accounting for CO$_2$ ice\nmantles as well as aggregate sintering and post-processing radiative transfer,\nwe simulate the polarimetric observation of HL Tau at 0.87 mm.

In all these contexts, a proper knowledge of the\nviscoelastic modulus is very important. However, the experimental\ncharacterization of the frequency dependent modulus, carried out through\ndifferent standard procedures, still presents some complexities, then possible\nalternative approaches are desirable. For example, the experimental\ninvestigation of viscoelastic beam dynamics would be challenging, especially\nfor the intrinsic simplicity of this kind of test. This is why, a deep\nunderstanding of damping mechanisms in viscoelastic beams results to be a quite\nimportant task to better predict their dynamics. With the aim to enlighten\ndamping properties in such structures, an analytical study of the transversal\nvibrations of a viscoelastic beam is presented in this paper. Some\ndimensionless parameters are defined, depending on the material properties and\nthe beam geometry, which enable to shrewdly design the beam dynamics. In this\nway, by properly tuning such disclosed parameters, for example the\ndimensionless beam length or a chosen material, it is possible to enhance or\nsuppress some resonant peaks, one at a time or more simultaneously. This is a\nremarkable possibility to efficiently control damping in these structures, and\nthe results presented in this paper may help in elucidating experimental\nprocedures for the characterization of viscoelastic materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 07:44:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

Supporting\nnewcomers in their first steps by recommending articles they would enjoy\nediting or editors they would enjoy collaborating with is thus a promising\nroute toward converting them into long-term contributors.

As such, these systems cannot make high-quality recommendations to\nnewcomers without any previous interactions -- the so-called cold-start\nproblem. The present paper addresses the cold-start problem on Wikipedia by\ndeveloping a method for automatically building short questionnaires that, when\ncompleted by a newly registered Wikipedia user, can be used for a variety of\npurposes, including article recommendations that can help new editors get\nstarted. Our questionnaires are constructed based on the text of Wikipedia\narticles as well as the history of contributions by the already onboarded\nWikipedia editors.

This issue can usually be avoided with a proper initialization of the\nweights. On the task of medical image segmentation in general, two techniques\nare oftentimes employed to tackle the training of a deep network $f_T$. The\nfirst one consists in reusing some weights of a network $f_S$ pre-trained on a\nlarge scale database ($e.g.$ ImageNet). This procedure, also known as\n$transfer$ $learning$, happens to reduce the flexibility when it comes to new\nnetwork design since $f_T$ is constrained to match some parts of $f_S$. The\nsecond commonly used technique consists in working on image patches to benefit\nfrom the large number of available patches. This paper brings together these\ntwo techniques and propose to train $arbitrarily$ $designed$ $networks$ that\nsegment an image in one forward pass, with a focus on relatively small\ndatabases. An experimental work have been carried out on the tasks of retinal\nblood vessel segmentation and the optic disc one, using four publicly available\ndatabases.

These reactive anti-jamming approaches are constrained by the\nlack of timely knowledge of jamming attacks. Bringing together the latest\nadvances in neural network architectures and ambient backscattering\ncommunications, this work allows wireless nodes to effectively \"face\" the\njammer by first learning its jamming strategy, then adapting the rate or\ntransmitting information right on the jamming signal. Specifically, to deal\nwith unknown jamming attacks, existing work often relies on reinforcement\nlearning algorithms, e.g., Q-learning. However, the Q-learning algorithm is\nnotorious for its slow convergence to the optimal policy, especially when the\nsystem state and action spaces are large.

To overcome this problem, we design a novel deep\nreinforcement learning algorithm using the recent dueling neural network\narchitecture. Our proposed algorithm allows the transmitter to effectively\nlearn about the jammer and attain the optimal countermeasures thousand times\nfaster than that of the conventional Q-learning algorithm. Through extensive\nsimulation results, we show that our design (using ambient backscattering and\nthe deep dueling neural network architecture) can improve the average\nthroughput by up to 426% and reduce the packet loss by 24%. By augmenting the\nambient backscattering capability on devices and using our algorithm, it is\ninteresting to observe that the (successful) transmission rate increases with\nthe jamming power.

Our analysis shows CD-28 1082 to be a very metal-poor object with\n[Fe/H] = -2.45 and enriched in carbon with [C/Fe] = 2.19. With a ratio of\n[Ba/Eu] ~ 0.02 the star satisfies the classification criteria of a CEMP-r/s\nstar. The objects CD-38 2151 with [Fe/H] = -2.03 and HD 30443 with [Fe/H] ~\n-1.68 are found to show the characteristic properties of CH stars. HE 0308-1612\nand HD 87853 are found to be moderately metal-poor with [Fe/H]~ -0.73; while HE\n0308-1612 is moderately enhanced with carbon ([C/Fe] ~ 0.78) and shows the\nspectral properties of CH stars, the abundance of carbon could not be estimated\nfor HD 87853. Among the two moderately metal-poor objects, HD 87080 ([Fe/H] =\n-0.48) shows near solar carbon abundance, and HD 176021 ([Fe/H] = -0.63) is\nmildly enhanced in carbon with [C/Fe] = 0.52. HD 176021 along with HD 202020 a\nknown binary, exhibit the characteristic properties of CH stars as far as the\nheavy element abundances are concerned. Five objects in our sample show\nspectral properties that are normally seen in barium stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 09:27:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

As a\nstarting point, we review and extend previous analysis of the power production\nand efficiency.

It is found that for a broad range of parameters, the power\nproduction reaches nearly its theoretical maximum value, with efficiencies more\nthan half of the Carnot efficiency and at the same time with rather small\nfluctuations. Moreover, we show that by demanding a non-zero power production,\nin the linear regime a stronger TUR can be formulated in terms of the\nthermoelectric figure of merit.

We then measured the rest-frame UV-blue linear polarization of a\nsample of 13 changing-look quasars, 7 of them being in a type 1.9-2 state. For\nall quasars but one the polarization degree is lower than 1%. This suggests\nthat the disappearance of the broad emission lines cannot be attributed to dust\nobscuration, and supports the scenario in which changes of look are caused by a\nchange in the rate of accretion onto the supermassive black hole. Such low\npolarization degrees also indicate that these quasars are seen under\ninclinations close to the system axis. One type 1.9-2 quasar in our sample\nshows a high polarization degree of 6.8%.

This property, by allowing metastable states, can potentially yield\ncatastrophic phenomena such as earthquakes or aerial landslides. The origin of\nhysteresis in granular flows is still debated. However, most mechanisms put\nforward so far rely on the presence of inertia at the particle level. In this\npaper, we study the avalanche dynamics of non-Brownian suspensions in slowly\nrotating drums and reveal large hysteresis of the avalanche angle even in the\nabsence of inertia. By using micro-silica particles whose interparticle\nfriction coefficient can be turned off, we show that microscopic friction,\nconversely to inertia, is key to triggering hysteresis in granular suspensions.\nTo understand this link between friction and hysteresis, we use the rotating\ndrum as a rheometer to extract the suspension rheology close to the flow onset\nfor both frictional and frictionless suspensions. This analysis shows that the\nflow rule for frictionless particles is monotonous and follows a power law of\nexponent $\\alpha \\!= \\! 0.37 \\pm 0.05$, in close agreement with the previous\ntheoretical prediction, $\\alpha\\!=\\! 0.35$. By contrast, the flow rule for\nfrictional particles suggests a velocity-weakening behavior, thereby explaining\nthe flow instability and the emergence of hysteresis. These findings show that\nhysteresis can also occur in particulate media without inertia, questioning the\nintimate nature of this phenomenon. By highlighting the role of microscopic\nfriction, our results may be of interest in the geophysical context to\nunderstand the failure mechanism at the origin of undersea landslides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 09:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

As opposed to most prior\nmethods, which use pretrained monolingual word vectors, postprocess them to\nmake them crosslingual, and finally average word vectors to obtain document\nvectors, Cr5 is trained end-to-end and is thus natively crosslingual as well as\ndocument-level. Moreover, since our algorithm uses the singular value\ndecomposition as its core operation, it is highly scalable. Experiments show\nthat our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a crosslingual\ndocument retrieval task. Finally, although not trained for embedding sentences\nand words, it also achieves competitive performance on crosslingual sentence\nand word retrieval tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 10:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

On the other hand, to jointly compute the\n3D registrations in n-cycles, we take 2 point matches between the first n-1\nconsecutive pairs (i.e., Scan 1 & Scan 2, ... , and Scan n-1 & Scan n) and 1 or\n2 point matches between Scan 1 and Scan n. Overall, we use 5, 7, and 10 point\nmatches for 3-, 4-, and 5-cycles, and recover 12, 18, and 24 degrees of\ntransformation variables, respectively. Using simulations and real-data we show\nthat the 3D registration using mini n-cycles are computationally efficient, and\ncan provide alternate and better initial poses compared to standard pairwise\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 10:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

To\neliminate such restrictions, we propose an efficient principled variational\napproach to uncalibrated PS under general illumination. To this end, the\nLambertian reflectance model is approximated through a spherical harmonic\nexpansion, which preserves the spatial invariance of the lighting. The joint\nrecovery of shape, reflectance and illumination is then formulated as a single\nvariational problem. There the shape estimation is carried out directly in\nterms of the underlying perspective depth map, thus implicitly ensuring\nintegrability and bypassing the need for a subsequent normal integration. To\ntackle the resulting nonconvex problem numerically, we undertake a two-phase\nprocedure to initialize a balloon-like perspective depth map, followed by a\n\"lagged\" block coordinate descent scheme. The experiments validate efficiency\nand robustness of this approach. Across a variety of evaluations, we are able\nto reduce the mean angular error consistently by a factor of 2-3 compared to\nthe state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 10:48:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 18:38:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-29"}

One way to address this problem is the so called\nproblem transformation method. This method is often used in multi-label\nlearning, but can also be used for multi-output prediction due to its\ngenerality and simplicity. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that uses\nthe problem transformation method for multi-output prediction, while\nsimultaneously learning the dependencies between target variables in a sparse\nand interpretable manner. In a first step, predictions are obtained for each\ntarget individually. Target dependencies are then learned via a component-wise\nboosting approach. We compare our new method with similar approaches in a\nbenchmark using multi-label, multivariate regression and mixed-type datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 10:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

Our method identifies the\nmost susceptible filters and applies retraining only to the filters that show\nthe highest activation maps distance between clean and distorted images.\nFilters are ranked using the Borda count election method and then only the most\naffected filters are fine-tuned. This significantly reduces the number of\nparameters to retrain.

In this paper, a novel adaptive\nmorphological reconstruction (AMR) operation is proposed that has three\nadvantages. Firstly, AMR can adaptively filter useless seeds while preserving\nmeaningful ones. Secondly, AMR is insensitive to the scale of structuring\nelements because multiscale structuring elements are employed.

In a feature\nrepresentation point of view, a nature approach to handle this situation is to\nconcatenate the spectral and spatial features into a single but high\ndimensional vector and then apply a certain dimension reduction technique\ndirectly on that concatenated vector before feed it into the subsequent\nclassifier. However, multiple features from various domains definitely have\ndifferent physical meanings and statistical properties, and thus such\nconcatenation hasn't efficiently explore the complementary properties among\ndifferent features, which should benefit for boost the feature\ndiscriminability.

Image-level\nannotations are much less expensive to acquire than pixel-level annotations,\nbut we lose a lot of information for the training of the model.

This is comparable to the\nmetallicities of the most metal poor galaxies observed so far, such as I Zw 18.\nConcerning massive stars, both rotating and nonrotating models spend most of\ntheir core-helium burning phase with an effective temperature higher than 8000\nK. Stars become red supergiants only at the end of their lifetimes, and few\nRSGs are expected.

To facilitate such applications, it is\ndesirable to utilize a general control platform for cooperative UAVs. However,\nexisting open-source control platforms cannot fulfill such a demand because (1)\nthey only support the leader-follower mode, which limits the design options for\nfleet control, (2) existing platforms can support only certain UAVs and thus\nlack of compatibility, and (3) these platforms cannot accurately simulate a\nflight mission, which may cause a big gap between simulation and real flight.\nTo address these issues, we propose a general control and monitoring platform\nfor cooperative UAV fleet, namely, CoUAV, which provides a set of core\ncooperation services of UAVs, including synchronization, connectivity\nmanagement, path planning, energy simulation, etc. To verify the applicability\nof CoUAV, we design and develop a prototype and we use the new system to\nperform an emergency search application that aims to complete a task with the\nminimum flying time.

In such cases, inter-vehicular communications should be exploited to\nsatisfy application requirements, although congestion control mechanisms are\nrequired to minimize the packet collision probability. In this work, we face\nthe issue of achieving accurate vehicle position estimation and prediction in a\nVANET scenario. State of the art solutions to the problem try to broadcast the\npositioning information periodically, so that vehicles can ensure that the\ninformation their neighbors have about them is never older than the\ninter-transmission period. However, the rate of decay of the information is not\ndeterministic in complex urban scenarios: the movements and maneuvers of\nvehicles can often be erratic and unpredictable, making old positioning\ninformation inaccurate or downright misleading. To address this problem, we\npropose to use the Quality of Information (QoI) as the decision factor for\nbroadcasting. We implement a threshold-based strategy to distribute position\ninformation whenever the positioning error passes a reference value, thereby\nshifting the objective of the network to limiting the actual positioning error\nand guaranteeing quality across the VANET. The threshold-based strategy can\nreduce the network load by avoiding the transmission of redundant messages, as\nwell as improving the overall positioning accuracy by more than 20% in\nrealistic urban scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 13:45:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

When the labeled information in target\ndomain is limited, transfer metric learning (TML) helps to learn the metric by\nleveraging the sufficient information from other related domains. Multi-task\nmetric learning (MTML), which can be regarded as a special case of TML,\nperforms transfer across all related domains. Current TML tools usually assume\nthat the same feature representation is exploited for different domains.\nHowever, in real-world applications, data may be drawn from heterogeneous\ndomains. Heterogeneous transfer learning approaches can be adopted to remedy\nthis drawback by deriving a metric from the learned transformation across\ndifferent domains. But they are often limited in that only two domains can be\nhandled. To appropriately handle multiple domains, we develop a novel\nheterogeneous multi-task metric learning (HMTML) framework.

The optical members of Serpens are\nconcentrated in three distinct groups located at 380 to 480 pc; the densest\nclusters are still highly obscured by optically-thick dust and have few optical\nmembers. The total population of young stars and protostars in Serpens is at\nleast 2000 stars, including past surveys that were most sensitive to protostars\nand disks, and may be far higher.

They are F- to G-type main-sequence stars polluted with heavy\nelements by a binary companion when the latter was on the Asymptotic Giant\nBranch (AGB). This companion is now a white dwarf that in most cases cannot be\ndirectly detected. We present a large systematic study of 60 objects classified\nas Ba dwarfs or CH subgiants. Combining radial-velocity measurements from\nHERMES and SALT high-resolution spectra with radial-velocity data from CORAVEL\nand CORALIE, we determine the orbital parameters of 27 systems. We also derive\ntheir masses by comparing their location in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram\nwith evolutionary models. We confirm that Ba dwarfs and CH subgiants are not at\ndifferent evolutionary stages and have similar metallicities, despite their\ndifferent names. Additionally, Ba giants appear significantly more massive than\ntheir main-sequence analogues. This is likely due to observational biases\nagainst the detection of hotter main-sequence post-mass-transfer objects.\nCombining our spectroscopic orbits with the Hipparcos astrometric data, we\nderive the orbital inclinations and the mass of the WD companion for four\nsystems. Since this cannot be done for all systems in our sample yet (but\nshould be with upcoming Gaia data releases), we also analyse the mass-function\ndistribution of our binaries. We can model this distribution with very narrow\nmass distributions for the two components and random orbital orientation on the\nsky. Finally, based on BINSTAR evolutionary models, we suggest that the orbital\nevolution of low-mass Ba systems can be affected by a second phase of\ninteraction along the Red Giant Branch of the Ba star, impacting on the\neccentricities and periods of the giants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 14:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

Expansion affects measurements of\nanisotropy because it breaks axisymmetry around the mean magnetic field.\nIndeed, the small-scale three-dimensional local anisotropy of magnetic\nfluctuations ({\\delta}B) as measured by structure functions (SF_B) is\nconsistent with tube-like structures for strong expansion. When passing to weak\nexpansion, structures become ribbon-like because of the flattening of SFB along\none of the two perpendicular directions. The power-law index that is consistent\nwith a spectral slope -5/3 for strong expansion now becomes closer to -3/2.\nThis index is also characteristic of velocity fluctuations in the solar wind.\nWe study velocity fluctuations ({\\delta}V) to understand if the anisotropy of\ntheir structure functions (SF_V ) also changes with the strength of expansion\nand if the difference with the magnetic spectral index is washed out once\nanisotropy is accounted for. We find that SF_V is generally flatter than SF_B.\nWhen expansion passes from strong to weak, a further flattening of the\nperpendicular SF_V occurs and the small-scale anisotropy switches from\ntube-like to ribbon-like structures. These two types of anisotropy, common to\nSF_V and SF_B, are associated to distinct large-scale variance anisotropies of\n{\\delta}B in the strong- and weak-expansion datasets.

Although it is easy to use,\nsuch top-hat masking is known to suffer from various leakage problems.\nTherefore, we want to extend the top-hat masking to a series of semi-analytic\nfunctions called the P-filters. Most importantly, the P-filters can seamlessly\nrealize the core idea of masking in CMB science, and, meanwhile, guarantee\ncontinuity up to the first derivative everywhere.

By comparison\nto the corresponding WMAP/Planck masks, we show that the P-filter performs much\nbetter than top-hat masking, and meanwhile, has the potential to supersede the\nprincipal idea of masking in CMB science.

The unweighted version,\nwhere all weights are equal, is well studied, and admits tight upper and lower\nbounds on message complexity. For weighted sampling with replacement, there is\na simple reduction to unweighted sampling with replacement. However, in many\napplications the stream has only a few heavy items which may dominate a random\nsample when chosen with replacement. Weighted sampling \\textit{without\nreplacement} (weighted SWOR) eludes this issue, since such heavy items can be\nsampled at most once.\n  In this work, we present the first message-optimal algorithm for weighted\nSWOR from a distributed stream. Our algorithm also has optimal space and time\ncomplexity. As an application of our algorithm for weighted SWOR, we derive the\nfirst distributed streaming algorithms for tracking \\textit{heavy hitters with\nresidual error}. Here the goal is to identify stream items that contribute\nsignificantly to the residual stream, once the heaviest items are removed.\nResidual heavy hitters generalize the notion of $\\ell_1$ heavy hitters and are\nimportant in streams that have a skewed distribution of weights. In addition to\nthe upper bound, we also provide a lower bound on the message complexity that\nis nearly tight up to a $\\log(1/\\epsilon)$ factor. Finally, we use our weighted\nsampling algorithm to improve the message complexity of distributed $L_1$\ntracking, also known as count tracking, which is a widely studied problem in\ndistributed streaming.

Focusing on this\nsecond case, in this paper we leverage stereo matching in order to improve\nmonocular depth estimation. To this aim we propose monoResMatch, a novel deep\narchitecture designed to infer depth from a single input image by synthesizing\nfeatures from a different point of view, horizontally aligned with the input\nimage, performing stereo matching between the two cues. In contrast to previous\nworks sharing this rationale, our network is the first trained end-to-end from\nscratch.

Exhaustive experimental\nresults prove how the synergy between i) the proposed monoResMatch architecture\nand ii) proxy-supervision attains state-of-the-art for self-supervised\nmonocular depth estimation.

Motivated by\nthese observations, we study the non-equilibrium beta process in the minimal\ncooling scenario of neutron stars, which inevitably occurs in pulsars. This\nout-of-equilibrium process yields the late time heating in the core of a\nneutron star, called the rotochemical heating, and significantly changes the\ntime evolution of the neutron star surface temperature. To perform a realistic\nanalysis of this heating effect, we include the singlet proton and triplet\nneutron pairing gaps simultaneously in the calculation of the rate and\nemissivity of this process, where the dependence of these pairing gaps on the\nnucleon density is also taken into account.

State-of-the-art FPGAs are\ncomplex hybrid devices that contain up to several millions of gates. Recently,\nresearch effort has been going into higher-level parallelization and hardware\nsynthesis methodologies that can exploit such a programmable technology. In\nthis paper, we explore the effectiveness of one such formal methodology in the\ndesign of parallel versions of the Serpent cryptographic algorithm. The\nsuggested methodology adopts a functional programming notation for specifying\nalgorithms and for reasoning about them. The specifications are realized\nthrough the use of a combination of function decomposition strategies, data\nrefinement techniques, and off-the-shelf refinements based upon higher-order\nfunctions. The refinements are inspired by the operators of Communicating\nSequential Processes (CSP) and map easily to programs in Handel-C (a hardware\ndescription language). In the presented research, we obtain several parallel\nSerpent implementations with different performance characteristics. The\ndeveloped designs are tested under Celoxica's RC-1000 reconfigurable computer\nwith its 2 million gates Virtex-E FPGA. Performance analysis and evaluation of\nthese implementations are included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 2019 21:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-12"}

A pair of black corner-sharing sites,\ni.e. second nearest neighbours may form a 'cross-connection' with a pair of\nwhite corner-sharing sites. In this case assigning connected status to both\npairs simultaneously, makes the system quasi-three dimensional, with\nintertwined black and white clusters. The two-dimensional character of the\nsystem is preserved by considering the black diagonal pair to be connected with\na probability $q$, in which case the crossing white pair of sites are deemed\ndisjoint. If the black pair is disjoint, the white pair is considered\nconnected. In this scenario we investigate (i) the variation of the Euler\nnumber $\\chi(p) \\ [=N_B(p)-N_W(p)]$ versus $p$ graph for varying $q$, (ii)\nvariation of the site percolation threshold with $q$ and (iii) size\ndistribution of the black clusters for varying $p$, when $q=0.5$.
