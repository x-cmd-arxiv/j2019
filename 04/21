They form the backbone\nfor graphical models and are readily obtained from the inverse of the\ncovariance matrix. For compositional data, the covariance structure is\nspecified from log ratios of variables, so unless we try to \"open\" the data via\na normalization, this implies changes in the definition and interpretation of\npartial correlations. In the present work, we elucidate how results derived by\nAitchison (1986) lead to a natural definition of partial correlation that has a\nnumber of advantages over current measures of association. For this, we show\nthat the residuals of log-ratios between a variable with a reference, when\nadjusting for all remaining variables including the reference, are\nreference-independent. Since the reference itself can be controlled for,\ncorrelations between residuals are defined for the variables directly without\nthe necessity to recur to ratios except when specifying which variables are\npartialled out. Thus, perhaps surprisingly, partial correlations do not have\nthe problems commonly found with measures of pairwise association on\ncompositional data. They are well-defined between two variables, are properly\nscaled, and allow for negative association. By design, they are\nsubcompositionally incoherent, but they share this property with conventional\npartial correlations (where results change when adjusting for the influence of\nfewer variables). We discuss the equivalence with normalization-based\napproaches whenever the normalizing variables are controlled for. We also\ndiscuss the partial variances and correlations we obtain from a previously\nstudied data set of Roman glass cups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2019 18:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-23"}

Here, we show that the FISH-Hi-C\nparadox can be resolved using a theory based on a Generalized Rouse Model for\nChromosomes (GRMC). The FISH-Hi-C paradox arises because the cell population is\nhighly heterogeneous, which means that a given contact is present in only a\nfraction of cells. Insights from the GRMC is used to construct a theory,\nwithout any adjustable parameters, to extract the distribution of\nsubpopulations from the FISH data, which quantitatively reproduces the Hi-C\ndata. Our results show that heterogeneity is pervasive in genome organization\nat all length scales, reflecting large cell-to-cell variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2019 19:17:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 21:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-25"}

The power method is a simple technique\nfor determining the dominant eigenmode of an operator $\\mathbf{A}$, and\nvariants of the power method are widely used in reactor analysis. Dynamic mode\ndecomposition is an algorithm for decomposing a time-series of\nspatially-dependent data and producing an explicit-in-time reconstruction for\nthat data. By viewing successive power-method iterates as snapshots of a\ntime-varying system tending toward a steady state, DMD can be used to predict\nthat steady state using (a sometime surprisingly small) $n$ iterates. The\nprocess of generating snapshots with the power method and extrapolating forward\nwith DMD can be repeated. The resulting restarted, DMD-accelerated power method\n(or DMD-PM($n$)) was applied to the two-dimensional IAEA diffusion benchmark\nand compared to the unaccelerated power method and Arnoldi's method. Results\nindicate that DMD-PM($n$) can reduce the number of power iterations required by\napproximately a factor of 5. However, Arnoldi's method always outperformed\nDMD-PM($n$) for an equivalent number of matrix-vector products $\\mathbf{Av}$.\nIn other words, DMD-PM($n$) cannot compete with leading eigensolvers if one is\nnot limited to snapshots produced by the power method. Contrarily, DMD-PM($n$)\ncan be readily applied as a post process to existing power-method applications\nfor which Arnoldi and similar methods are not directly applicable. A slight\nvariation of the method was also found to produce reasonable approximations to\nthe first and second harmonics without substantially affecting convergence of\nthe dominant mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2019 20:11:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-23"}

Yet, it remains unclear how humans acquire knowledge\nabout these social structures to successfully navigate social relationships.\nHere we address this knowledge gap with an interdisciplinary neuroimaging study\ndrawing on recent advances in network science and statistical learning.\nSpecifically, we collected BOLD MRI data while participants learned the\ncommunity structure of both social and non-social networks, in order to examine\nwhether the learning of these two types of networks was differentially\nassociated with functional brain network topology. From the behavioral data in\nboth tasks, we found that learners were sensitive to the community structure of\nthe networks, as evidenced by a slower reaction time on trials transitioning\nbetween clusters than on trials transitioning within a cluster. From the\nneuroimaging data collected during the social network learning task, we\nobserved that the functional connectivity of the hippocampus and\ntemporoparietal junction was significantly greater when transitioning between\nclusters than when transitioning within a cluster. Furthermore, temporoparietal\nregions of the default mode were more strongly connected to hippocampus,\nsomatomotor, and visual regions during the social task than during the\nnon-social task. Collectively, our results identify neurophysiological\nunderpinnings of social versus non-social network learning, extending our\nknowledge about the impact of social context on learning processes. More\nbroadly, this work offers an empirical approach to study the learning of social\nnetwork structures, which could be fruitfully extended to other participant\npopulations, various graph architectures, and a diversity of social contexts in\nfuture studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2019 22:04:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-23"}

In this paper, we propose a model with 3-gated model which fuses\nthe global and local image features together for the task of image caption\ngeneration. The model mainly has three gated structures. 1) Gate for the global\nimage feature, which can adaptively decide when and how much the global image\nfeature should be imported into the sentence generator. 2) The gated recurrent\nneural network (RNN) is used as the sentence generator. 3) The gated feedback\nmethod for stacking RNN is employed to increase the capability of nonlinearity\nfitting. More specially, the global and local image features are combined\ntogether in this paper, which makes full use of the image information. The\nglobal image feature is controlled by the first gate and the local image\nfeature is selected by the attention mechanism. With the latter two gates, the\nrelationship between image and text can be well explored, which improves the\nperformance of the language part as well as the multi-modal embedding part.\nExperimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art for image caption generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2019 05:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-23"}

However, GP kernel design and the associated\nhyper-parameter optimization are still hard and to a large extend open\nproblems. In this paper, we consider the task of GP regression for time series\nmodeling and analysis. The underlying stationary kernel can be approximated\narbitrarily close by a new proposed grid spectral mixture (GSM) kernel, which\nturns out to be a linear combination of low-rank sub-kernels. In the case where\na large number of the sub-kernels are used, either the Nystr\\\"{o}m or the\nrandom Fourier feature approximations can be adopted to deal efficiently with\nthe computational demands. The unknown GP hyper-parameters consist of the\nnon-negative weights of all sub-kernels as well as the noise variance; their\nestimation is performed via the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation framework.\nTwo efficient numerical optimization methods for solving the unknown\nhyper-parameters are derived, including a sequential majorization-minimization\n(MM) method and a non-linearly constrained alternating direction of multiplier\nmethod (ADMM). The MM matches perfectly with the proven low-rank property of\nthe proposed GSM sub-kernels and turns out to be a part of efficiency, stable,\nand efficient solver, while the ADMM has the potential to generate better local\nminimum in terms of the test MSE. Experimental results, based on various\nclassic time series data sets, corroborate that the proposed GSM kernel-based\nGP regression model outperforms several salient competitors of similar kind in\nterms of prediction mean-squared-error and numerical stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2019 07:37:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Several features\nof compound chondrules indicate that compound chondrules are formed via the\ncollisions of supercooled precursors. We evaluate whether compound chondrules\ncan be formed via the collision of supercooled chondrule precursors in the\nframework of the shock-wave heating model by using semi-analytical methods and\ndiscuss whether most of the crystallized chondrules can avoid destruction upon\ncollision in the post-shock region.

This procedure brings benefit to device management by\nidentifying potential equipment problems and improve dynamic model for\nsimulation study. The proposed framework utilizes operation data collected in\nDigital Fault Recorder (DFR) to evaluate STATCOM's response to dynamic system\nevents. One of the challenges on getting accurate model response comes from\nSTATCOMs with automatic gain adjustment feature. This feature actively measures\nthe external system's Thevanin impedance and accordingly changes the STATCOM\ngain. Therefore, when trying to recreate the field measurements in the\nsimulation environment, it is necessary to match the short circuit level (SCL)\nof the external system equivalent.

Previous research efforts to find causes of such increase have\nsuggested diverse contributors, like growth of online media, echo chamber\neffects, media biases, or disinformation propagation. Yet, we lack theoretic\ntools to understand, quantify, and predict the emergence of high political\npolarization among voters and their legislators. Here, we analyze millions of\nroll-call votes cast in the U.S. Congress over the past six decades. Our\nanalysis reveals the critical change of polarization patterns that started at\nthe end of 1980's. In earlier decades, polarization within each Congress tended\nto decrease with time. In contrast, in the recent decades, the polarization has\nbeen likely to grow within each term. To shed light on the reasons for this\nchange, we introduce here a formal model for competitive dynamics to quantify\nthe evolution of polarization patterns in the legislative branch of the U.S.\ngovernment. Our model represents dynamics of polarization, enabling us to\nsuccessfully predict the direction of polarization changes in 28 out of 30 U.S.\nCongresses elected in the past six decades. From the evolution of polarization\nlevel as measured by the Rice index, our model extracts a hidden parameter -\npolarization utility which determines the convergence point of the polarization\nevolution. The increase in the polarization utility implied by the model\nstrongly correlates with two current trends: growing polarization of voters and\nincreasing influence of election campaign funders. Two largest peaks of the\nmodel's polarization utility correlate with significant political or\nlegislative changes happening at the same time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2019 23:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-18"}

Traditionally, Collaborative Filtering(CF) provides a way\nto learn user and item embeddings from the user-item interaction history.\nHowever, the performance is limited due to the sparseness of user behavior\ndata. With the emergence of online social networks, social recommender systems\nhave been proposed to utilize each user's local neighbors' preferences to\nalleviate the data sparsity for better user embedding modeling. We argue that,\nfor each user of a social platform, her potential embedding is influenced by\nher trusted users. As social influence recursively propagates and diffuses in\nthe social network, each user's interests change in the recursive process.\nNevertheless, the current social recommendation models simply developed static\nmodels by leveraging the local neighbors of each user without simulating the\nrecursive diffusion in the global social network, leading to suboptimal\nrecommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a deep influence\npropagation model to stimulate how users are influenced by the recursive social\ndiffusion process for social recommendation. For each user, the diffusion\nprocess starts with an initial embedding that fuses the related features and a\nfree user latent vector that captures the latent behavior preference. The key\nidea of our proposed model is that we design a layer-wise influence propagation\nstructure to model how users' latent embeddings evolve as the social diffusion\nprocess continues. We further show that our proposed model is general and could\nbe applied when the user~(item) attributes or the social network structure is\nnot available. Finally, extensive experimental results on two real-world\ndatasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model, with more than\n13% performance improvements over the best baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2019 16:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

It is conjectured\nto underlie many of the brain's fundamental computational abilities. However,\nnot much is known about the robustness of a spike-based WTA network to the\ninherent randomness of the input spike trains. In this work, we consider a\nspike-based $k$--WTA model wherein $n$ randomly generated input spike trains\ncompete with each other based on their underlying statistics, and $k$ winners\nare supposed to be selected. We slot the time evenly with each time slot of\nlength $1\\, ms$, and model the $n$ input spike trains as $n$ independent\nBernoulli processes. The Bernoulli process is a good approximation of the\npopular Poisson process but is more biologically relevant as it takes the\nrefractory periods into account. Due to the randomness in the input spike\ntrains, no circuits can guarantee to successfully select the correct winners in\nfinite time. We focus on analytically characterizing the minimal amount of time\nneeded so that a target minimax decision accuracy (success probability) can be\nreached.\n  We first derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the decision time.
