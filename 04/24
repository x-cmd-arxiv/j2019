As one example, recent work\nhas shown that classifiers trained to detect topical content on Twitter can\ngeneralize well beyond the training data. Since access to Twitter data is\nhidden behind a limited search API, it is impossible (for most users) to apply\nthese classifiers directly to the Twitter unfiltered data streams (\"firehose\").\nRather, applications must first decide what content to retrieve through the\nsearch API before filtering that content with topical classifiers. Thus, it is\ncritically important to query the Twitter API relative to the intended topical\nclassifier in a way that minimizes the amount of negatively classified data\nretrieved. In this paper, we propose a sequence of query optimization methods\nthat generalize notions of the maximum coverage problem to find the subset of\nquery terms within the API limits that cover most of the topically relevant\ntweets without sacrificing precision.

However, recent observations of protoplanetary disks\npoint towards low volatile carbon abundances in many systems, including at\nradii interior to the CO snowline. One potential explanation is that gas phase\ncarbon is chemically reprocessed into less volatile species, which are frozen\non dust grain surfaces as ice. This mechanism has the potential to change the\nprimordial C/H ratio in the gas. However, current observations primarily probe\nthe upper layers of the disk. It is not clear if the low volatile carbon\nabundances extend to the midplane, where planets form. We have run a grid of\n198 chemical models, exploring how the chemical reprocessing of CO depends on\ndisk mass, dust grain size distribution, temperature, cosmic ray and X-ray\nionization rate, and initial water abundance. Building on our previous work\nfocusing on the warm molecular layer, here we analyze the results for our grid\nof models in the disk midplane at 12 au. We find that either an ISM level\ncosmic ray ionization rate or the presence of UV photons due to a low dust\nsurface density are needed to chemically reduce the midplane CO gas abundance\nby at least an order of magnitude within 1 Myr. In the majority of our models\nCO does not undergo substantial reprocessing by in situ chemistry and there is\nlittle change in the gas phase C/H and C/O ratios over the lifetime of the\ntypical disk. However, in the small sub-set of disks where the disk midplane is\nsubject to a source of ionization or photolysis, the gas phase C/O ratio\nincreases by up to nearly 9 orders of magnitude due to conversion of CO into\nvolatile hydrocarbons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 17:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

Optical and\nX-ray pulsations were detected simultaneously in the X-ray high intensity mode\nin which the source spends $\\sim$ 70% of the time, and both disappeared in the\nlow mode, indicating a common underlying physical mechanism. In addition,\noptical and X-ray pulses were emitted within a few km, had similar pulse shape\nand distribution of the pulsed flux density compatible with a power-law\nrelation $F_{\\nu} \\propto \\nu^{-0.7}$ connecting the optical and the 0.3-45 keV\nX-ray band. Optical pulses were detected also during flares with a pulsed flux\nreduced by one third with respect to the high mode; the lack of a simultaneous\ndetection of X-ray pulses is compatible with the lower photon statistics. We\nshow that magnetically channeled accretion of plasma onto the surface of the\nneutron star cannot account for the optical pulsed luminosity ($\\sim 10^{31}$\nerg/s). On the other hand, magnetospheric rotation-powered pulsar emission\nwould require an extremely efficient conversion of spin-down power into pulsed\noptical and X-ray emission.

In our framework, a stable\nvariational ultra-weak formulation is adopted, and the equivalence of the\n$L_2$-norm of the error with the dual graph norm of the residual is\nestablished. This dual norm is showed to be localizable over vertex-based patch\nsubdomains of the computational domain under the condition of the orthogonality\nof the residual to the piecewise affine hat functions. We show that this\ncondition is valid for some well-known numerical methods including\ncontinuous/discontinuous Petrov--Galerkin and discontinuous Galerkin methods.\nConsequently, a well-posed local problem on each patch is identified, which\nleads to a global conforming reconstruction of the discrete solution. We prove\nthat this reconstruction provides a guaranteed upper bound on the $L_2$ error.\nMoreover, up to a constant, it also gives local lower bounds on the $L_2$\nerror, where the generic constant is proven to be independent of\nmesh-refinement, polynomial degree of the approximation, and the advective\nvelocity. This leads to robustness of our estimates with respect to the\nadvection as well as the polynomial degree.

This information can in principle be preserved if\nvariability is shared across many neurons, but depends on the structure of the\nshared variability and its relationship to sensory encoding at the population\nlevel. The structure of this shared variability in neural activity can be\ncharacterized by latent variable models, although they have thus far typically\nbeen used under restrictive mathematical assumptions. Here we introduce two\nnonlinear latent variable models for analyzing large-scale neural recordings.\nWe first present a general nonlinear latent variable model that is agnostic to\nthe stimulus tuning properties of the individual neurons, and is hence well\nsuited for exploring neural populations whose tuning properties are not well\ncharacterized. This motivates a second class of model, the Generalized Affine\nModel, which simultaneously determines each neuron's stimulus selectivity and a\nset of latent variables that modulate these stimulus-driven responses both\nadditively and multiplicatively. While these approaches can detect very general\nnonlinear relationships in shared neural variability, we find that neural\nactivity recorded in anesthetized primary visual cortex (V1) is best described\nby a single additive and single multiplicative latent variable, i.e. an `affine\nmodel'. In contrast, application of the same models to recordings in awake\nmacaque prefrontal cortex discover more general nonlinearities to compactly\ndescribe the population response variability. These results thus demonstrate\nhow nonlinear latent variable models can be used to describe population\nresponse variability, and suggest that a range of methods is necessary to study\ndifferent brain regions under different experimental conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 17:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

Methods: We take 23 strong lenses\ndrawn from the CMASS sample, measure their Einstein radii and stellar masses\nusing multi-band photometry from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey, then fit a model\ndistribution for the IMF mismatch parameter and dark matter halo mass to the\nwhole sample.

Two basic structural questions in this\nframework concern the nature of the twin hypercharge gauge symmetry and the\norigin of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking needed to achieve the correct\nvacuum alignment. Both questions are addressed in a simple extension of the\nMirror Twin Higgs model with an exact $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and a scalar\nfield that spontaneously breaks both twin hypercharge and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Due\nto the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and an approximate $U(2)$ symmetry in the\npotential, a new hypercharge scalar appears in the visible sector and, like the\nHiggs, is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson with a weak-scale mass. Couplings\nbetween the hypercharge scalar and matter provide a new dynamical source of\ntwin sector fermion masses. Depending on the nature and size of these\ncouplings, a variety of experimental signatures may arise, including quark and\nlepton flavor violation, neutrino masses and mixings as well as direct collider\nprobes of the hypercharged scalar. These signals are correlated with the twin\nmatter spectrum, which can differ dramatically from the visible one, including\ndynamical realizations of fraternal-like scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2019 17:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

Very recently [IPEC 18], two\nof the authors introduced a novel technique for the complexity analysis of\n#IndSub(P), inspired by the \"topological approach to evasiveness\" of Kahn, Saks\nand Sturtevant [FOCS 83] and the framework of graph motif parameters due to\nCurticapean, Dell and Marx [STOC 17], allowing them to prove hardness of a wide\nrange of properties P. In this work, we refine this technique for graph\nproperties that are non-trivial on edge-transitive graphs with a prime power\nnumber of edges.

However, they\nall assume a row-distributed dataset, addressing scalability only with respect\nto the number of data points and not the number of features, and increasing\ncommunication cost for high-dimensional data. In order to allow for scalability\nacross both the data point and feature dimensions, and reduce communication\ncost, we propose block-distributed GBTs. We achieve communication efficiency by\nmaking full use of the data sparsity and adapting the Quickscorer algorithm to\nthe block-distributed setting. We evaluate our approach using datasets with\nmillions of features, and demonstrate that we are able to achieve multiple\norders of magnitude reduction in communication cost for sparse data, with no\nloss in accuracy, while providing a more scalable design. As a result, we are\nable to reduce the training time for high-dimensional data, and allow more\ncost-effective scale-out without the need for expensive network communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 20:10:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 19:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-30"}

Determining optimal values of the model parameters is formulated as\ntraining hidden neurons within a machine learning framework, based on available\nfinancial option prices. The framework consists of two parts: a forward pass in\nwhich we train the weights of the ANN off-line, valuing options under many\ndifferent asset model parameter settings; and a backward pass, in which we\nevaluate the trained ANN-solver on-line, aiming to find the weights of the\nneurons in the input layer. The rapid on-line learning of implied volatility by\nANNs, in combination with the use of an adapted parallel global optimization\nmethod, tackles the computation bottleneck and provides a fast and reliable\ntechnique for calibrating model parameters while avoiding, as much as possible,\ngetting stuck in local minima. Numerical experiments confirm that this\nmachine-learning framework can be employed to calibrate parameters of\nhigh-dimensional stochastic volatility models efficiently and accurately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 20:12:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-03"}

This\nadvantageous pore structure can be obtained by defect formation, mostly via\npost-synthetic acid etching, which has been studied extensively on water-stable\nMOFs. Here we show that a water-unstable HKUST-1 MOF can also be modified in a\ncorresponding manner by using phosphoric acid as a size-selective etching agent\nand a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide and methanol as a dilute solvent.\nInterestingly, we demonstrate that the etching process which is time- and\nacidity- dependent, can result in formation of defective HKUST-1 with extra\ninterconnected hexagonal macropores without compromising on the bulk\ncrystallinity. These findings suggest an intelligent scalable synthetic method\nfor formation of hierarchical porosity in MOFs that are prone to hydrolysis,\nfor improved molecular accessibility and diffusion for catalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 20:17:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-25"}

A common but trivial\napproach is to train individual binary classifiers per label, but the\nperformance can be improved by considering associations within the labels. Like\nwith any machine learning algorithm, hyperparameter tuning is important to\ntrain a good multi-label classifier model. The task of selecting the best\nhyperparameter settings for an algorithm is an optimisation problem. Very\nlimited work has been done on automatic hyperparameter tuning and AutoML in the\nmulti-label domain. This paper attempts to fill this gap by proposing a neural\nnetwork algorithm, CascadeML, to train multi-label neural network based on\ncascade neural networks. This method requires minimal or no hyperparameter\ntuning and also considers pairwise label associations. The cascade algorithm\ngrows the network architecture incrementally in a two phase process as it\nlearns the weights using adaptive first order gradient algorithm, therefore\nomitting the requirement of preselecting the number of hidden layers, nodes and\nthe learning rate. The method was tested on 10 multi-label datasets and\ncompared with other multi-label classification algorithms.

Their power is expected to be\nespecially pronounced for problems where direct analogs of a quantum system\nunder study can be encoded coherently within a quantum computer. A first step\ntoward harnessing this power is to express the building blocks of known\nphysical systems within the language of quantum gates and circuits. In this\npaper, we present a quantum calculation of an archetypal quantum system:\nneutrino oscillations. We define gate arrangements that implement the neutral\nlepton mixing operation and neutrino time evolution in two-, three-, and\nfour-flavor systems. We then calculate oscillation probabilities by coherently\npreparing quantum states within the processor, time evolving them unitarily,\nand performing measurements in the flavor basis, with close analogy to the\nphysical processes realized in neutrino oscillation experiments, finding\nexcellent agreement with classical calculations. We provide recipes for\nmodeling oscillation in the standard three-flavor paradigm as well as\nbeyond-standard-model scenarios, including systems with sterile neutrinos,\nnon-standard interactions, Lorentz symmetry violation, and anomalous\ndecoherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 22:36:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 22:49:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 2020 15:47:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

However, it is\nnot easy for each user to make such decisions and it is troublesome to set the\nprivacy preference at each time. Therefore, we propose a method to recommend\nlocation privacy preferences for decision making. Comparing to existing method,\nour method can improve the accuracy of recommendation by using matrix\nfactorization and preserve privacy strictly by local differential privacy,\nwhereas the existing method does not achieve formal privacy guarantee. In\naddition, we found the best granularity of a location privacy preference, that\nis, how to express the information in location privacy protection. To evaluate\nand verify the utility of our method, we have integrated two existing datasets\nto create a rich information in term of user number. From the results of the\nevaluation using this dataset, we confirmed that our method can predict\nlocation privacy preferences accurately and that it provides a suitable method\nto define the location privacy preference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 00:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-01"}

The MIR setting arises when the data is\na collection of bags, where each bag consists of several instances which\ncorrespond to the same and unique real-valued label. The goal of a MIR\nalgorithm is to find a mapping from the instances of an unseen bag to its\ntarget value. The instance-MIR algorithm treats all the instances separately\nand maps each instance to a label. The final bag label is then taken as the\nmean or the median of the predictions for that given bag. While it is\nconceptually simple, taking a single statistic to summarize the distribution of\nthe labels in each bag is a limitation.

Traditional first-order methods depend on the eigenvalue\ndecomposition at each iteration which takes most of the computation time. In\norder to reduce the cost, we propose an inexact algorithm framework based on a\npolynomial subspace extraction. The idea is to use an additional\npolynomial-filtered iteration to extract an approximated eigenspace, and\nproject the iteration matrix on this subspace, followed by an optimization\nupdate. The accuracy of the extracted subspace can be controlled by the degree\nof the polynomial filters. This kind of subspace extraction also enjoys the\nwarm start property: the subspace of the current iteration is refined from the\nprevious one. Then this framework is instantiated into two algorithms: the\npolynomial-filtered proximal gradient method and the polynomial-filtered\nalternating direction method of multipliers. We give a theoretical guarantee to\nthe two algorithms that the polynomial degree is not necessarily very large.\nThey share the same convergence speed as the corresponding original methods if\nthe polynomial degree grows with an order $\\Omega(\\log k)$ at the $k$-th\niteration. If the warm-start property is considered, the degree can be reduced\nto a constant, independent of the iteration $k$.

Comparison of non-thermal\nvelocity dispersions derived from C$^{18}$O and N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ for the\nfilaments and dense cores indicates that some of dense cores share similar\nkinematics with those of the surrounding filaments while several dense cores\nhave different kinematics with those of their filaments. This suggests that the\nformation mechanism of dense cores and filaments can be different in individual\nfilaments depending on their morphologies and environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 01:25:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

A\nkey feature of the analysis is that the Orr--Sommerfeld and Squire operators\nare each considered separately. Physically this corresponds to considering two\nseparate processes: (i) the response of wall-normal velocity fluctuations to\nexternal forcing; and (ii) the response of streamwise velocity fluctuations to\nwall-normal velocity fluctuations. In this way we exploit the fact that, for\nstreamwise-constant fluctuations, the dynamics governing the wall-normal\nvelocity are independent of the mean velocity profile (and therefore the mean\nshear). The analysis is performed for both plane Couette flow and plane\nPoiseuille flow; and for each we consider linear amplification mechanisms about\nboth the laminar and turbulent mean velocity profiles. The analysis reveals two\nthings. First, that the most amplified structures (with a spanwise spacing of\napproximately $4h$, where $h$ is the channel half height) are to a great extent\nencoded in the Orr-Sommerfeld operator alone, thus helping to explain their\nprevalence.

Specifically, we rethink the importance of receptive field\n(RF) and effective receptive field (ERF) in the background of face detection.\nEssentially, the RFs of neurons in a certain layer are distributed regularly in\nthe input image and theses RFs are natural \"anchors\". Combining RF \"anchors\"\nand appropriate RF strides, the proposed method can detect a large range of\ncontinuous face scales with 100% coverage in theory. The insightful\nunderstanding of relations between ERF and face scales motivates an efficient\nbackbone for one-stage detection. The backbone is characterized by eight\ndetection branches and common layers, resulting in efficient computation.\nComprehensive and extensive experiments on popular benchmarks: WIDER FACE and\nFDDB are conducted. A new evaluation schema is proposed for\napplication-oriented scenarios. Under the new schema, the proposed method can\nachieve superior accuracy (WIDER FACE Val/Test -- Easy: 0.910/0.896, Medium:\n0.881/0.865, Hard: 0.780/0.770; FDDB -- discontinuous: 0.973, continuous:\n0.724).

This linearity has led to a dangerously low efficiency\ndegree in resource use, and has brought forth serious concerns for the\nviability of our natural ecosystem. Circular economy is introducing a circular\nworkflow for the lifetime of products. It generalizes the disposal phase,\nreconnecting it to manufacturing, distribution and end-use, thus limiting true\ndeposition to the environment. This process has not been extended so far to\nsoftware. Nonetheless, the development of software follows the same phases, and\nalso entails the use-and waste-of considerable resources.

It employs a recently proposed concept-the Socket Store-which is an\nonline store distributing end-user network logic in modular form. The Store\nmodules act as mediators between the end-user network logic and the network\nresources. It is shown that the Socket Store can implement all circular economy\nprinciples to the software life-cycle, with considerable gains in resource\nwaste.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 07:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-25"}

The uncertainties of models' parameters propagate to\nquantities like volume or density -- the most important and informative\nproperties of asteroids -- affecting conclusions about their physical nature.\nOur knowledge on shapes and spins of small solar system bodies comes mostly\nfrom visual, disk-integrated photometry. In this work we present a method for\nasteroid model uncertainty assessment based on visual photometry (lightcurves\nand sparse-in-time absolute measurements) allowing the determination of\nrealistic volume uncertainty, as well as spin axis orientation, rotational\nperiod and local surface features. The sensitivity analysis is conducted by\ncreating clones of the nominal model and accepting the ones that fit the\nobservations within a confidence level. The uncertainties of model parameters\nare extracted from the extreme values found in the accepted clone population.\nCreation of such population of clones enables the conversion of a deterministic\nasteroid model into stochastic one, and can be utilized to create observation\npredictions with error bars. The method was used to assess the uncertainties of\nfictitious test models and real targets, i.e. (21) Lutetia, (89) Julia, (243)\nIda, (433) Eros and (162173) Ryugu.

The reason is that the absorption of\nthe spectral line decays very quickly towards the wings, just where the\ncircular polarization has a larger amplitude.

More\nresearch is focussed on handcrafting complex and larger networks, and the\ndesign decisions are often ad-hoc and based on intuition. Some recent research\nhas aimed to demystify the learning dynamics in neural nets by attempting to\nbuild a theory from first principles, such as characterising the non-linear\ndynamics of specialised \\textit{linear} deep neural nets (such as orthogonal\nnetworks). In this work, we expand and derive properties of learning dynamics\nrespected by general multi-layer linear neural nets. Although an\nover-parameterisation of a single layer linear network, linear multi-layer\nneural nets offer interesting insights that explain how learning dynamics\nproceed in small pockets of the data space. We show in particular that multiple\nlayers in linear nets grow at approximately the same rate, and there are\ndistinct phases of learning with markedly different layer growth. We then apply\na linearisation process to a general RelU neural net and show how nonlinearity\nbreaks down the growth symmetry observed in liner neural nets. Overall, our\nwork can be viewed as an initial step in building a theory for understanding\nthe effect of layer design on the learning dynamics from first principles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 08:29:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-25"}

However, recognizing the weather conditions from\na single image remains challenging and has not been studied thoroughly.\nGenerally, most previous works treat weather recognition as a single-label\nclassification task, namely, determining whether an image belongs to a specific\nweather class or not. This treatment is not always appropriate, since more than\none weather conditions may appear simultaneously in a single image. To address\nthis problem, we make the first attempt to view weather recognition as a\nmulti-label classification task, i.e., assigning an image more than one labels\naccording to the displayed weather conditions. Specifically, a CNN-RNN based\nmulti-label classification approach is proposed in this paper. The\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) is extended with a channel-wise attention\nmodel to extract the most correlated visual features. The Recurrent Neural\nNetwork (RNN) further processes the features and excavates the dependencies\namong weather classes. Finally, the weather labels are predicted step by step.\nBesides, we construct two datasets for the weather recognition task and explore\nthe relationships among different weather conditions.

Considerable efforts must be\nspent in obtaining an optimal solution to certain instances that we encounter\nin the real world scenarios.

Reoptimization of\nNP-hard optimization problem precisely addresses this concern. It turns out\nthat for some reoptimization versions of the NP-hard problems, we may only hope\nto obtain an approximate solution to a new instance. In this paper, we\nspecifically address the reoptimization of path vertex cover problem. The\nobjective in $k$-$path$ vertex cover problem is to compute a minimum subset $S$\nof the vertices in a graph $G$ such that after removal of $S$ from $G$ there is\nno path with $k$ vertices in the graph.

While TR is usually implemented in the\ntime domain, the same benefit can be obtained in an orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiplexing (OFDM) system by precoding the information in the\nfrequency domain. Besides using multiple antennas, the focusing effect of TR\nalso comes from the use of a high rate back-off factor (BOF), which is the\nsignal up-sampling (or down-sampling) rate in the original time-domain TR\nprecoding. However, a frequency-domain TR precoding in the literature has only\nconsidered BOF of one, which does not fully exploit the focusing property of\nTR.

The validity of\nthis assumption has not been tested yet. We investigate here the structure and\nevolution of the three components of the solar large-scale magnetic field in\n2010 - 2017, covering the ascending to mid-declining phase of solar cycle 24,\nusing SOLIS/VSM vector synoptic maps of the photospheric magnetic field. We\ncompare the observed VSM vector magnetic field to the potential vector field\nderived using the VSM LOS magnetic field observations as an input. The new\nvector field data allow us to derive the meridional inclination and the azimuth\nangle of the magnetic field and to investigate their solar cycle evolution and\nlatitudinal profile of these quantities. SOLIS/VSM vector data show that the\nphotospheric magnetic field is in general fairly non-radial. In the meridional\nplane the field is inclined toward the equator, reflecting the dipolar\nstructure of the solar magnetic field. Rotationally averaged meridional\ninclination does not have significant solar cycle variation. While the vector\nradial component $B_r$ and the potential radial component $B_r^{PFSS}$ are\nfairly similar, the meridional and zonal components do not agree very well. We\nfind that SOLIS/VSM vector observations are noisy at high latitudes and suffer\nfrom the vantage point effect more than LOS observations. This is due to\ndifferent noise properties in the LOS and transverse components of the magnetic\nfield, which needs to be addressed in future studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 10:57:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-25"}

While\npartial least squares (PLS) is traditionally used in the process literature for\ndesigning soft sensors, the statistical literature has focused on sparse\nlearners, such as Lasso and relevance vector machine (RVM), to solve the high\ndimensional data problem. In the current study, predictive performances of\nthree regression techniques, PLS, Lasso and RVM were assessed and compared\nunder various offline and online soft sensing scenarios applied on datasets\nfrom five real industrial plants, and a simulated process. In offline learning,\npredictions of RVM and Lasso were found to be superior to those of PLS when a\nlarge number of time-lagged predictors were used. Online prediction results\ngave a slightly more complicated picture. It was found that the minimum\nprediction error achieved by PLS under moving window (MW), or just-in-time\nlearning scheme was decreased up to ~5-10% using Lasso, or RVM. However, when a\nsmall MW size was used, or the optimum number of PLS components was as low as\n~1, prediction performance of PLS surpassed RVM, which was found to yield\noccasional unstable predictions. PLS and Lasso models constructed via online\nparameter tuning generally did not yield better predictions compared to those\nconstructed via offline tuning. We present evidence to suggest that retaining a\nlarge portion of the available process measurement data in the predictor\nmatrix, instead of preselecting variables, would be more advantageous for\nsparse learners in increasing prediction accuracy. As a result, Lasso is\nrecommended as a better substitute for PLS in soft sensors; while performance\nof RVM should be validated before online application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 11:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-25"}

A latent variable for the user\nstate is updated as the user views more items and we learn more about their\ninterests. The latent variable model is conceptually simple and elegant; yet\nrequires sophisticated computational technique to approximate the integral over\nthe latent variable. We provide computational solutions using both the\nre-parameterization trick and also using the Bouchard bound for the softmax\nfunction, we further explore employing a variational auto-encoder and a\nvariational Expectation-Maximization algorithm for tightening the variational\nbound. The model performs well against a number of baselines.

To address this issue, we propose in this\npaper a novel method for automatic facial landmark localization in 3D face data\ndesigned specifically to address appearance variability caused by significant\npose variations. Our method builds on recent cascaded-regression-based methods\nto facial landmarking and uses a gating mechanism to incorporate multiple\nlinear cascaded regression models each trained for a limited range of poses\ninto a single powerful landmarking model capable of processing arbitrary posed\ninput data. We develop two distinct approaches around the proposed gating\nmechanism: i) the first uses a gated multiple ridge descent (GRID) mechanism in\nconjunction with established (hand-crafted) HOG features for face alignment and\nachieves state-of-the-art landmarking performance across a wide range of facial\nposes, ii) the second simultaneously learns multiple-descent directions as well\nas binary features (SMUF) that are optimal for the alignment tasks and in\naddition to competitive landmarking results also ensures extremely rapid\nprocessing.

In this\nthesis we study the dagger in its own right and show how basic category theory\nadapts to dagger categories.\n  We develop a notion of a dagger limit that we show is suitable in the\nfollowing ways: it subsumes special cases known from the literature; dagger\nlimits are unique up to unitary isomorphism; a wide class of dagger limits can\nbe built from a small selection of them; dagger limits of a fixed shape can be\nphrased as dagger adjoints to a diagonal functor; dagger limits can be built\nfrom ordinary limits in the presence of polar decomposition; dagger limits\ncommute with dagger colimits in many cases.\n  Using cofree dagger categories, the theory of dagger limits can be leveraged\nto provide an enrichment-free understanding of limit-colimit coincidences in\nordinary category theory.

Hrushovski have\nstudied in depth the model theory of ACFA,the model companion of difference\nfields with one automorphism. Our fields with commuting automorphisms\ngeneralize this setting. We have several automorphisms and they are required to\ncommute. Hrushovski has proved that in the case of fields with two or more\ncommuting automorphisms,the existentially closed models do not necessarily form\na first order model class. In the present paper, we introduce FCA-classes, an\nAEC framework for studying the existentially closed models of the theory of\nfields with commuting automorphisms.We prove that an FCA-class has AP and JEP\nand thus a monster model, that Galois types coincide with existential types in\nexistentially closed models,that the class is homogeneous,and that there is a\nversion of type amalgamation theorem that allows to combine three types under\ncertain conditions.

Following Hutchinson's seminal suggestion, many theoreticians\nhave tried to create diversity through a fluctuating environment, which impairs\nor slows down competitive exclusion. However, fluctuating-environment models\noften only produce a dozen of coexisting species at best. Here, we investigate\nhow to create richer communities in fluctuating environments, using an\nempirically parameterized model. Building on the forced Lotka-Volterra model of\nScranton and Vasseur (Theor Ecol 9(3):353-363, 2016), inspired by phytoplankton\ncommunities, we have investigated the effect of two coexistence mechanisms,\nnamely the storage effect and higher intra- than interspecific competition\nstrengths (i.e., strong self-regulation). We tuned the intra/inter competition\nratio based on empirical analyses, in which self-regulation dominates\ninterspecific interactions. Although a strong self-regulation maintained more\nspecies (50%) than the storage effect (25%), we show that none of the two\ncoexistence mechanisms considered could ensure the coexistence of all species\nalone. Realistic seasonal environments only aggravated that picture, as they\ndecreased persistence relative to a random environment. However, strong\nself-regulation and the storage effect combined superadditively so that all\nspecies could persist with both mechanisms at work. Our results suggest that\ncombining different coexistence mechanisms into community models might be more\nfruitful than trying to find which mechanism best explains diversity. We\nadditionally highlight that while biomass-trait distributions provide some\nclues regarding coexistence mechanisms, they cannot indicate unequivocally\nwhich mechanisms are at play.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 14:36:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-25"}

The robot navigates in the infinite oriented\ngrid $\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$. Some cells of the grid are full (contain a\nbrick) and others are empty. The subgraph of the grid induced by full cells,\ncalled the field, is initially connected. The (Manhattan) distance between the\nfarthest cells of the field is called its span. The robot starts at a full\ncell. It can carry at most one brick at a time. At each step it can pick a\nbrick from a full cell, move to an adjacent cell and drop a brick at an empty\ncell. The aim of the robot is to construct the most compact possible structure\ncomposed of all bricks, i.e., a nest. That is, the robot has to move all bricks\nin such a way that the span of the resulting field be the smallest. Our main\nresult is the design of a deterministic finite automaton that accomplishes this\ntask and subsequently stops, for every initially connected field, in time\n$O(sz)$, where $s$ is the span of the initial field and $z$ is the number of\nbricks.

We also calculate several versions of\nlower-resolution synoptic maps from the high-resolution maps and calculate\ntheir rotational weak-field asymmetries. We find that the weak-field\nasymmetries increase with decreasing map resolution. A very large fraction of\nweak-field asymmetries are statistically significant, with the fraction of\nsignificant weak-field asymmetries increasing with decreasing resolution.\nSignificant weak-field asymmetries of high- and low-resolution maps mainly\noccur at the same times and have the same sign. Weak-field asymmetries for the\ndifferent data-sets and resolutions vary quite similarly in time, and their\nmutual correlations are very high, especially for low-resolution maps. These\nresults give strong evidence for weak-field asymmetries reflecting a real\nfeature of weak field values, which is best seen in medium- and low-resolution\nsynoptic maps and is most likely related to the supergranulation scale of the\nphotospheric field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 15:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-25"}

In the proposed\nmethod, a shadow-up function is applied to adaptive gamma correction with\nweighting distribution, and a denoising filter is also used to avoid noise\nbeing amplified in dark regions.

Two different Brane-world\ncosmologies with black strings have been introduced for any cosmological\nconstant $\\Lambda$ using two empirical forms of the scale factor. In both\nmodels, we have performed a fine-tuning between the brane tension and the\ncosmological constant so that the EoS parameter $\\omega(t)\\rightarrow -1$ for\nthe current epoch where the redshift $z\\simeq 0$. We then used these fine-tuned\nvalues to calculate and plot all parameters and energy conditions. The\ndeceleration-acceleration cosmic transition is allowed in both models, and the\njerk parameter $j\\rightarrow 1$ at late-times. Both solutions predict a future\ndark energy-dominated universe in which $\\omega=-1$ with no crossing to the\nphantom divide line. While the pressure in the first solution is always\nnegative, the second solution predicts a better behavior of cosmic pressure\nwhere the pressure is negative only in the late-time accelerating era but\npositive in the early-time decelerating era. Since black strings have been\nproved to be unstable by some authors, this instability can actually reflect\ndoubts on the stability of cosmological models with black strings (Swiss-cheese\ntype brane-worlds cosmological models).

Thick disks emerge in radiatively inefficient\ndisks which are associated with sub-Eddington as well as super-Eddington\naccretion regimes yet we show that the inverse correlation between winds and\njets survives where it should not, namely in a luminosity regime normally\nattributed to radio quiet active galaxies which are modeled with thin disks.\nThis along with other lines of evidence argues against thick disks as the\nfoundation behind the radio loud/radio quiet dichotomy, opening up the\npossibility that jetted versus non jetted black holes may be understood within\nthe context of radiatively efficient thin disk accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 12:29:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

An attractor of RIFS has a\nlocal self-similar or self-affine structure and looks more naturally than one\nof IFS. The contractivity factors of IFS(RIFS) determine fractal characteristic\nand shape of its attractor. Therefore, the HVRFIF with function contractivity\nfactors has more flexibility and diversity than the HVFIF constructed by\niterated function system (IFS) with constant contractivity factors. The\nanalytic properties of the interpolation functions play very important roles in\ndetermining whether these functons can be applied to the practical problems or\nnot.

However, event-based object\nrecognition systems are far behind their frame-based counterparts in terms of\naccuracy.

Subsequently, we propose a backtracking-free k-d tree mechanism for\nefficient feature matching by taking advantage of the low-dimensionality of the\nfeature representation.

In this\ncontext, we propose a multi-agent architecture, named EasySched, aiming at\nelaborating predictive and reactive scheduling as the result of a coordination\nbetween systems producing goods and systems producing renewable energy. The\nvalidation of this architecture is original, and was conducted in a completely\nand physically distributed way, using networked embedded systems. This\nvalidation was done on a series of instances inspired by the literature. The\nresults showed that EasySched succeeds in adapting the production of goods\naccording to the available renewable energy\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 09:36:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-30"}

This issue has led to the development of three-dimensional (3D)\npreforms with reinforcement through-the-thickness, making it possible to\ncombine good mechanical performance in-plane and out-of-plane. In this study,\nthe tufting technology is used to strength through-the-thickness of stacked\nlayers. This reinforcement technique has extensively gained attention in the\ncomposite industry due to its ability to reinforce thick pieces. The present\nstudy focuses on the mechanical behaviour of tufted preforms before resin\nimpregnation due to their application in the forming steps during the\nmanufacturing process. Therefore, an experimental investigation of the\nmechanical behaviour (tensile, bending and in-plane shear) was carried out in\norder to outline the influence of tufting on the mechanical properties of the\nfinal structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 09:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-23"}

Therefore, this study investigates the energy dissipated by the\nbrittle structures and the possible damage indices based on energy for the\ndamage assessment of gravity design frames. In the framework of an Energy-Based\nSeismic Design Approach, we need the assessment of the Demand and on the\nCapacity, both expressed in Energy. A methodology for the assessment of the\nseismic energy demands imposed on structures is already proposed, but not such\nmethodology that makes consensus is proposed for the calculation of the Energy\ndissipation Capacity avoiding the Hysteretic models. The estimation of the\nenergy expended by the building during an earthquake excitation is a tricky\nissue. For this purpose, this study considers the wavelet based energy\nestimation and compares it with different approaches for measuring the damages\nof a structure: the dominant inelastic period of a building and the more\nclassical measure, the inter-story drift. IDA analysis are performed in energy,\ndrift and inelastic period. Furthermore, the damage assessment results based on\nthe expended energy for three gravity design buildings are compared and\ndiscussed relatively to the results expressed in inelastic period and drift.\nFinally, this study concludes that no significant effects of number of\ninelastic cycles to the damage assessment results for low ductile structures.\nHowever, this study also highlights the effects of number of inelastic cycles\nto the damage for medium and high ductile structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 09:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-25"}
