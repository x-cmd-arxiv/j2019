One of the\ngreatest challenges faced by interpreters is the accurate translation of\ndifficult terminology like proper names, numbers, or other entities.\nIntelligent computer-assisted interpreting (CAI) tools that could analyze the\nspoken word and detect terms likely to be untranslated by an interpreter could\nreduce translation error and improve interpreter performance. In this paper, we\npropose a task of predicting which terminology simultaneous interpreters will\nleave untranslated, and examine methods that perform this task using supervised\nsequence taggers. We describe a number of task-specific features explicitly\ndesigned to indicate when an interpreter may struggle with translating a word.\nExperimental results on a newly-annotated version of the NAIST Simultaneous\nTranslation Corpus (Shimizu et al., 2014) indicate the promise of our proposed\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 16:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

Approximating a hard CQ by a query from\nsuch a fragment can thus allow for an efficient approximate evaluation. While\nunderapproximations (i.e., approximations that return correct answers only) are\nwell-understood, the dual notion of overapproximations (i.e, approximations\nthat return complete - but not necessarily sound - answers), and also a more\ngeneral notion of approximation based on the symmetric difference of query\nresults, are almost unexplored. In fact, the decidability of the basic problems\nof evaluation, identification, and existence of those approximations has been\nopen.\n  This article establishes a connection between overapproximations and\nexistential pebble games that allows for studying such problems systematically.\nBuilding on this connection, it is shown that the evaluation and identification\nproblem for overapproximations can be solved in polynomial time. While the\ngeneral existence problem remains open, the problem is shown to be decidable in\n2EXPTIME over the class of acyclic CQs and in PTIME for Boolean CQs over binary\nschemata. Additionally we propose a more liberal notion of overapproximations\nto remedy the known shortcoming that queries might not have an\noverapproximation, and study how queries can be overapproximated in the\npresence of tuple generating and equality generating dependencies.\n  The techniques are then extended to symmetric difference approximations and\nused to provide several complexity results for the identification, existence,\nand evaluation problem for this type of approximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 16:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

To this end, we propose to learn a reinforcement learning\nprocedure in a federated way, where individual off-policy learners can solve\nthe individual meta-training tasks, and then consolidate these solutions into a\nsingle meta-learner. Since the central meta-learner learns by imitating the\nsolutions to the individual tasks, it can accommodate either the standard\nmeta-RL problem setting or a hybrid setting where some or all tasks are\nprovided with example demonstrations.

We observe the property of regional homogeneity in\nadversarial perturbations and suggest that the defenses are less robust to\nregionally homogeneous perturbations.

We propose an automated method to\nassociate arrivals with earthquake sources and obtain source locations\napplicable to such situations. To do so we use a pattern detection metric based\non the principle of backprojection to reveal candidate sources, followed by\ngraph-theory-based clustering and an integer linear optimization routine to\nassociate arrivals with the minimum number of sources necessary to explain the\ndata.

As a result of the cooperative nature of these interactions, the\nsystem's dynamics are captured by the behavior of a single mean-field,\ncollective spin. In this mean-field limit, it has recently been shown that the\ninterplay between photon losses and periodic driving of light-matter coupling\ncan lead to time-crystalline-like behavior of the collective spin. In this\nwork, we investigate whether such a Dicke time crystal is stable to\nperturbations that explicitly break the mean-field solvability of the\nconventional Dicke model. In particular, we consider the addition of\nshort-range interactions between atoms, which breaks the collective coupling\nand leads to complex many-body dynamics. In this context, the interplay between\nperiodic driving, dissipation and interactions yields a rich set of dynamical\nresponses including long-lived and metastable Dicke time crystals, where losses\ncan cool down the many-body heating resulting from the continuous pump of\nenergy from the periodic drive. Specifically, when the additional short-range\ninteractions are ferromagnetic, we observe time crystalline behavior at\nnon-perturbative values of the coupling strength, suggesting the possible\nexistence of stable dynamical order in a driven-dissipative quantum many-body\nsystem.

For the replica negativity we find that its increment is\na polynomial with integer coefficients depending only on the sizes of the two\nregions. The logarithmic negativity turns out to have a more complicated\nfunctional structure than its replica version, typically involving roots of\npolynomials on the sizes of the regions.

Their\norigin is still debated as some UCDs are considered to be the remnant nuclei of\nstripped dwarf galaxies while others seem to mark the high-mass end of the star\ncluster population. We aim to characterise the properties of a UCD found at\nvery close projected distance (1.1 kpc) from the centre of the low-mass\n(M~10^10 M_sun) early-type galaxy FCC47. This is a serendipitous discovery from\nMUSE adaptive optics science verification data. We explore the potential origin\nof this UCD as either a massive cluster or the remnant nucleus of a dissolved\ngalaxy. We use archival Hubble Space Telescope data to study the photometric\nand structural properties of FCC47-UCD1. In the MUSE data, the UCD is\nunresolved, but we use its spectrum to determine the radial velocity and\nmetallicity. FCC47-UCD1's surface brightness is best described by a single King\nprofile with low concentration C = R_t/R_c ~ 10 and large effective radius (r_e\n= 24pc). Its integrated magnitude and a blue colour (G = -10.6 mag, g-z = 1.46\nmag) combined with with a metallicity of [M/H] = -1.12+-0.10 dex and an age > 8\nGyr obtained from the full fitting of the MUSE spectrum suggests a stellar\npopulation mass of M_star = 4.87x10^6 M_sun. The low S/N of the MUSE spectrum\nprevents detailed stellar population analysis. Due to the limited spectral\nresolution of MUSE, we can only give an upper limit on the velocity dispersion\n(sig < 17km/s), and consequently on its dynamical mass (M_dyn < 1.3x10^7\nM_sun). The origin of the UCD cannot be constrained with certainty. The low\nmetallicity, old age and magnitude are consistent with a star cluster origin,\nwhereas the extended size is consistent with an origin as the stripped nucleus\nof a dwarf galaxy with a initial stellar mass of a few 10^8 M_sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 18:08:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

Astrobiological evolution of the Milky Way (or the shape of its\n\"astrobiological landscape\") has emerged as one of the key research topics in\nrecent years. In order to build precise, quantitative models of the Galactic\nhabitability, we need to account for two opposing tendencies of life and\nintelligence in the most general context: the tendency to spread to all\navailable ecological niches (conventionally dubbed \"colonization\") and the\ntendency to succumb to various types of existential catastrophes\n(\"catastrophism\"). These evolutionary tendencies have become objects of study\nin fields such as ecology, macroevolution, risk analysis, and futures studies,\nwhile a serious astrobiological treatment has been lacking so far. Aims. Our\naim is to numerically investigate the dynamics of opposed processes of\nexpansion (panspermia, colonization) and extinction (catastrophic mechanisms)\nof life in the Galaxy. Methods. We employ a new type of numerical simulation\nbased on 1D probabilistic cellular automaton with very high temporal\nresolution, in order to study astrobiological dynamics. Results. While the\nlargest part of the examined parameter space shows very low habitability\nvalues, as expected, the remaining part has some observationally appealing\nfeatures that imply, among other things, a reduction in the amount of\nfine-tuning necessary for resolving the Fermi paradox.

In this letter, we calculate for the first time the full transonic\nhydrodynamic escape of an Earth-like atmosphere. We consider the case of an\nEarth-mass planet with an atmospheric composition identical to that of the\ncurrent Earth orbiting at 1 AU around a young and very active solar mass star.\n  Methods. To model the upper atmosphere, we used the Kompot Code, which is a\nfirst-principles model that calculates the physical structures of the upper\natmospheres of planets, taking into account hydrodynamics and the main chemical\nand thermal processes taking place in the upper atmosphere of a planet. This\nmodel enabled us to calculate the 1D vertical structure of the atmosphere using\nas input the high-energy spectrum of a young and active Sun.\n  Results. The atmosphere has the form of a transonic hydrodynamic Parker wind,\nwhich has an outflow velocity at the upper boundary of our computational domain\nthat exceeds the escape velocity. The outflowing gas is dominated by atomic\nnitrogen and oxygen and their ion equivalents and has a maximum ionization\nfraction of 20%. The mass outflow rate is found to be 1.8x10^9 g s^-1, which\nwould erode the modern Earth's atmosphere in less than 0.1 Myr.\n  Conclusions. This extreme mass loss rate suggests that an Earth-like\natmosphere cannot form when the planet is orbiting within the habitable zone of\na very active star. Instead, such an atmosphere can only form after the\nactivity of the star has decreased to a much lower level. This happened in the\nearly atmosphere of the Earth, which was likely dominated by other gases such\nas CO2. Since the time it takes for the activity of a star to decay is highly\ndependent on its mass, this is important for understanding possible formation\ntimescales for planets orbiting low-mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 18:52:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

We consider operators on\nthe space of probability measure that induce changes in the statistical\nproperties of a process, and formulate entropy productions in terms of these\nchange-of-probability-measure (CPM) operators. This mathematical underpinning\nof the origin of entropy productions allows us to achieve an organization of\nvarious forms of fluctuation relations: All entropy productions have a\nnon-negative mean value, admit the integral fluctuation theorem, and satisfy a\nrather general fluctuation relation. Other results such as the transient\nfluctuation theorem and detailed fluctuation theorems then are derived from the\ngeneral fluctuation relation with more constraints on the operator.

We present a straightforward way to correct those PCA\nphase-demodulation errors. We give mathematical formulas to fully analyze\nPCA-based nPSA (PCA-nPSA). These formulas give a) the PCA-nPSA frequency\ntransfer function (FTF), b) its corrected Lissajous figure, c) the corrected\nPCA-nPSA formula, d) its harmonic robustness, and e) its signal-to-noise-ratio\n(SNR). We show that the PCA-nPSA can be seen as a linear quadrature filter, and\nas consequence, one can find its FTF. Using the FTF, we show why plain PCA\noften fails to demodulate nonuniform phase-shifted fringes. Previous works on\nPCA-nPSA (without FTF), give specific numerical/experimental fringe data to\n\"visually demonstrate\" that their new nPSA works better than competitors. This\noften leads to biased/favorable fringe pattern selections which \"visually\ndemonstrate\" the superior performance of their new nPSA. This biasing is herein\ntotally avoided because we provide figures-of-merit formulas based on linear\nsystems and stochastic process theories. However, and for illustrative purposes\nonly, we provide specific fringe data phase-demodulation, including\ncomprehensive analysis and comparisons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 19:16:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

Unlike the MW, we have the advantage of a global view of M31,\nenabling M31 to be observed with techniques that also apply to more distant\ngalaxies. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that M31 may have survived a major\nmerger within the last several Gyr, shaping the morphology of its stellar halo\nand triggering a starburst, while leaving the stellar disk largely intact. The\nMW and M31 thus provide complementary opportunities for in-depth studies of the\ndisks, halos, and satellites of L* galaxies.\n  Our understanding of the M31 system will be transformed in the 2020s if they\ninclude wide field facilities for both photometry (HST-like sensitivity and\nresolution) and spectroscopy (10-m class telescope, >1 sq. deg. field, highly\nmultiplexed, R~ 3000 to 6000).

Numerous experiments have\nbeen devised to assess the symmetry energy and constrain its functional\ndependence with the nucleon density. Further constraints follow from a stellar\nmodeling using the EOS to reproduce astronomical observations such as neutron\nstar masses and radii. The recent detection of gravitational waves emitted from\nneutron star mergers and the nucleosynthesis ensuing from these events caused a\nsurge of interest for such studies.

To address this challenge, we\nhave developed a machine learning algorithm based on symbolic regression in the\nform of genetic programming that is capable of discovering accurate,\ncomputationally efficient manybody potential models. The key to our approach is\nto explore a hypothesis space of models based on fundamental physical\nprinciples and select models within this hypothesis space based on their\naccuracy, speed, and simplicity.

In the case of the corporate sector purchase\nprogramme (CSPP) of the European Central Bank, which involves large-scale\npurchases of securities issued by corporations in the euro area, such a\nthreshold can be defined in terms of an ordinal running variable. This feature\nposes challenges to RD estimation due to the lack of a meaningful measure of\ndistance. To evaluate such program, this paper proposes an RD approach for\nordinal running variables under the local randomization framework. The proposal\nfirst estimates an ordered probit model for the ordinal running variable. The\nestimated probability of being assigned to treatment is then adopted as a\nlatent continuous running variable and used to identify a covariate-balanced\nsubsample around the threshold.

Here we use\nstate-of-the-art numerical simulations of atmospheric transport with\nmeteorological data to follow the trajectory of many spores released in the\nopen atmosphere at different times of day, during different seasons and at\ndifferent locations across North America. While individual spores follow\nunpredictable trajectories due to turbulence, in the aggregate patterns emerge:\nstatistically, spores released during the day fly for several days, while\nspores released at night return to the ground within a few hours. Differences\nare caused by intense turbulence during the day and weak turbulence at night.\nThe pattern is widespread but its reliability varies, for example, day/night\npatterns are stronger in southern regions, where temperatures are warmer.\nResults provide a set of testable hypotheses explaining intermittent and\nregular patterns of spore release as strategies to maximize spore survival in\nthe air.

The library is implemented in Q#, a language designed to\nexpress quantum algorithms at scale, and interfaces with NWChem, a leading\nelectronic structure package. We define a standardized schema for this\ninterface, Broombridge, that describes second-quantized Hamiltonians, along\nwith metadata required for effective quantum simulation, such as trial\nwavefunction ansatzes. This schema is generated for arbitrary molecules by\nNWChem, conveniently accessible, for instance, through Docker containers and a\nrecently developed web interface EMSL Arrows. We illustrate use of the library\nwith various examples, including ground- and excited-state calculations for\nLiH, H$_{10}$, and C$_{20}$ with an active-space simplification, and\nautomatically obtain resource estimates for classically intractable examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 22:23:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-03"}

The MUN Explorer Autonomous Underwater Vehicle\n(AUV) is built to do mapping-type missions of seabeds as well as survey\nmissions. These missions require a great deal of power to reach underwater\ndepths (i.e. 3000 meters). The MUN Explorer uses 11 rechargeable Lithium-ion\n(Li-ion) batteries as the main power source with a total capacity of 14.6kWh to\n17.952kWh, and the vehicle can run for 10 hours. The draw-backs of operating\nthe existing power system of the MUN Explorer, which was done by the researcher\nat the Holyrood management facility, include mobilization costs, logistics and\ntransport, and facility access, all of which should be taken into\nconsideration. Recharging the batteries for at least 8 hours is also very\nchallenging and time consuming. To overcome these challenges and run the MUN\nExplorer for a long time, it is essential to integrate a fuel cell into an\nexisting power system (i.e. battery bank). The integration of the fuel cell not\nonly will increase the system power, but it will also reduce the number of\nbatteries needed as suggested by HOMER software. In this paper, an integrated\nfuel cell is designed to be added into the MUN Explorer AUV along with a\nbattery bank system to increase its power system. The system sizing is\nperformed using HOMER software. The results from HOMER software show that a 1kW\nfuel cell and 8 Li-ion batteries can increase the power system capacity to 68\nkWh.

Two defects exist in black-box iterative attacks that\ngenerate adversarial examples by incrementally adjusting the noise-adding\ndirection for each step. On the one hand, existing iterative attacks add noises\nmonotonically along the direction of gradient ascent, resulting in a lack of\ndiversity and adaptability of the generated iterative trajectories. On the\nother hand, it is trivial to perform adversarial attack by adding excessive\nnoises, but currently there is no refinement mechanism to squeeze redundant\nnoises. In this work, we propose Curls & Whey black-box attack to fix the above\ntwo defects. During Curls iteration, by combining gradient ascent and descent,\nwe `curl' up iterative trajectories to integrate more diversity and\ntransferability into adversarial examples. Curls iteration also alleviates the\ndiminishing marginal effect in existing iterative attacks. The Whey\noptimization further squeezes the `whey' of noises by exploiting the robustness\nof adversarial perturbation. Extensive experiments on Imagenet and\nTiny-Imagenet demonstrate that our approach achieves impressive decrease on\nnoise magnitude in l2 norm. Curls & Whey attack also shows promising\ntransferability against ensemble models as well as adversarially trained\nmodels. In addition, we extend our attack to the targeted misclassification,\neffectively reducing the difficulty of targeted attacks under black-box\ncondition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 01:16:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

To make the framework applicable for various scenarios in\nMAN, we consider the transmitter- and the receiver-oriented node association\nrules as well as the air-to-ground and air-to-air channel models, which form\nline of sight links with a location-dependent probability.

Due to the tremendous growth\nof various vehicular applications, a huge amount of data is generated through\nadvanced on-board devices and is deemed critical to improve driving safety and\nenhance vehicular services. However, cloud based models often fall short in\napplications where latency and mobility are critical. In order to fully realize\nthe potential of vehicular networks, the challenges of efficient communication\nand computation need to be addressed. In this direction, vehicular fog\ncomputing (VFC) has emerged which extends the concept of fog computing to\nconventional vehicular networks. It is a geographically distributed paradigm\nthat has the potential to conduct time-critical and data-intensive tasks by\npushing intelligence (i.e. computing resources, storage, and application\nservices) in the vicinity of end vehicles. However secure and reliable\ntransmission are of significant importance in highly-mobile vehicular networks\nin order to ensure the optimal Quality of Service (QoS). In this direction,\nseveral authentication mechanisms have been proposed in the literature but most\nof them are found unfit due to absence of decentralization, anonymity, and\ntrust characteristics. Thus, an effective cross-datacenter authentication and\nkey-exchange scheme based on blockchain and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)\nis proposed in this paper. Here, the distributed ledger of blockchain is used\nfor maintaining the network information while the highly secure ECC is employed\nfor mutual authentication between vehicles and road side units (RSUs).\nAdditionally, the proposed scheme is lightweight and scalable for the\nconsidered VFC setup.

It allows bi-directional flow of\ncommunication and electricity between electric vehicles (EVs) and the Smart\nGrid (SG), in order to provide more sophisticated energy trading. However, due\nto the involvement of a huge amount of trading data and the presence of\nuntrusted entities in the visiting networks, the underlying V2G infrastructure\nsuffers from various security and privacy challenges. Although, several\nsolutions have been proposed in the literature to address these problems,\nissues like lack of mutual authentication and anonymity, incapability to\nprotect against several attack vectors, generation of huge overhead, and\ndependency on centralized infrastructures make security and privacy issues even\nmore challenging.

This excess is consistent with redshifted CII emission, in which\ncase we report $b_{\\mathrm{CII}}I_{\\mathrm{CII}} =2.0^{+1.2}_{-1.1}\\times 10^5$\nJy/sr at $95\\%$ confidence, which strongly favors many collisional excitation\nmodels of CII emission. Our detection shows strong evidence for a model with a\nnon-zero CII parameter, though line intensity mapping observations at high\nspectral resolution will be needed to confirm this result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 02:42:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

As a result, when presented with an unknown class during\ntesting, such closed-set assumption forces the model to classify it as one of\nthe known classes. However, in a real world scenario, classification models are\nlikely to encounter such examples. Hence, identifying those examples as unknown\nbecomes critical to model performance. A potential solution to overcome this\nproblem lies in a class of learning problems known as open-set recognition. It\nrefers to the problem of identifying the unknown classes during testing, while\nmaintaining performance on the known classes. In this paper, we propose an\nopen-set recognition algorithm using class conditioned auto-encoders with novel\ntraining and testing methodology. In contrast to previous methods, training\nprocedure is divided in two sub-tasks, 1. closed-set classification and, 2.\nopen-set identification (i.e. identifying a class as known or unknown). Encoder\nlearns the first task following the closed-set classification training\npipeline, whereas decoder learns the second task by reconstructing conditioned\non class identity. Furthermore, we model reconstruction errors using the\nExtreme Value Theory of statistical modeling to find the threshold for\nidentifying known/unknown class samples. Experiments performed on multiple\nimage classification datasets show proposed method performs significantly\nbetter than state of the art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 03:47:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

To this end, LiDAR sensor data can be\nincorporated to improve the visual image-based road detection, because LiDAR\ndata is less susceptible to visual noises. However, the main difficulty in\nintroducing LiDAR information into visual image-based road detection is that\nLiDAR data and its extracted features do not share the same space with the\nvisual data and visual features. Such gaps in spaces may limit the benefits of\nLiDAR information for road detection. To overcome this issue, we introduce a\nnovel Progressive LiDAR Adaptation-aided Road Detection (PLARD) approach to\nadapt LiDAR information into visual image-based road detection and improve\ndetection performance. In PLARD, progressive LiDAR adaptation consists of two\nsubsequent modules: 1) data space adaptation, which transforms the LiDAR data\nto the visual data space to align with the perspective view by applying\naltitude difference-based transformation; and 2) feature space adaptation,\nwhich adapts LiDAR features to visual features through a cascaded fusion\nstructure. Comprehensive empirical studies on the well-known KITTI road\ndetection benchmark demonstrate that PLARD takes advantage of both the visual\nand LiDAR information, achieving much more robust road detection even in\nchallenging urban scenes. In particular, PLARD outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art road detection models and is currently top of the publicly\naccessible benchmark leader-board.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 04:22:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-17"}

However, it is well known that equilibria are\ninefficient in general. In addition to the intrinsic inefficiency of\nequilibria, the authors recently showed that, in mixed-autonomy networks in\nwhich autonomous vehicles maintain a shorter headway than human-driven cars,\nincreasing the fraction of autonomous vehicles in the network may increase the\ninefficiency of equilibria. In this work, we study the possibility of obviating\nthe inefficiency of equilibria in mixed-autonomy traffic networks via pricing\nmechanisms. In particular, we study assigning prices to network links such that\nthe overall or social delay of the resulting equilibria is minimum. First, we\nstudy the possibility of inducing such optimal equilibria by imposing a set of\nundifferentiated prices, i.e. a set of prices that treat both human-driven and\nautonomous vehicles similarly at each link. We provide an example which\ndemonstrates that undifferentiated pricing is not sufficient for achieving\nminimum social delay. Then, we study differentiated pricing where the price of\ntraversing each link may depend on whether vehicles are human-driven or\nautonomous. Under differentiated pricing, we prove that link prices obtained\nfrom the marginal cost taxation of links will induce equilibria with minimum\nsocial delay if the degree of road capacity asymmetry (i.e. the ratio between\nthe road capacity when all vehicles are human-driven and the road capacity when\nall vehicles are autonomous) is homogeneous among network links.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 05:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

This third process is\ncharacterized by abrupt cluster dissolution connected with the loss of\ndynamical equilibrium. The abrupt dissolution is powered by strong energy\ngeneration from a stellar-mass black hole subsystem accompanied by tidal\nstripping. Additionally, we argue that such a mechanism should also work for\neven tidally under-filling clusters with top-heavy initial mass function.\nObservationally, star clusters which undergo dissolution powered by the third\nmechanism would look as a 'dark cluster' i.e. composed of stellar mass black\nholes surrounded by an expanding halo of luminous stars (Banerjee & Kroupa\n2011), and they should be different from 'dark clusters' harbouring\nintermediate mass black holes as discussed by Askar et al.

In recent studies, mRNA-mRNA interaction instances have been\nobserved, where both partners appear in the same pathway without any direct\nlink between them, or any prior knowledge about their relationship. Those\nrecently discovered cases suggest that RRI scope is much wider than those\naforementioned elite classes.\n  We revisit our RNA-RNA interaction partition function algorithm, piRNA, which\ncomputes the partition function, base-pairing probabilities, and structure for\nthe comprehensive Turner energy model using 96 different dynamic programming\ntables. In this study, we strategically retreat from sophisticated\nthermodynamic models to the much simpler base pair counting model. That might\nseem counter-intuitive at the first glance; our idea is to benefit from the\nadvantages of such simple models in terms of running time and memory footprint\nand compensate for the associated information loss by adding machine learning\ncomponents in the future.\n  Here, simple weighted base pair counting is considered to obtain BPPart for\nBase-pair Partition function and BPMax for Base-pair Maximization, which use 9\nand 2 tables respectively. They are empirically 225 and 1350 fold faster than\npiRNA.

This puts Tor as a target for attacks by organizations and governmental\nbodies whose goal is to hinder users' ability to connect to it. These attacks\ninclude deep packet inspection (DPI) to classify Tor traffic as well as\nlegitimate Tor client impersonation (active probing) to expose Tor bridges. As\na response to Tor-blocking attempts, the Tor community has developed Pluggable\nTransports (PTs), tools that transform the appearance of Tor's traffic flow. In\nthis paper we introduce a new approach aiming to enhance the PT's resistance\nagainst active probing attacks, as well as white-listing censorship by\npartitioning the handshake of the PT from its encrypted communication. Thus,\nallowing mixing different PTs, e.g., ScrambleSuit for the handshake and FTE for\nthe traffic itself.

To illustrate our claim, we introduce\nDNS-Morph: a new method of transforming the handshake data of a PT by imitating\na sequence of DNS queries and responses. Using DNS-Morph, the Tor client acts\nas a DNS client which sends DNS queries to the Tor bridge, and receives DNS\nresponses from it.

However, accurate orifice localization is hard\nbecause of the high anatomic variation of LAA, and unclear position and\norientation of the orifice in available CT views.

Accurate and\ntimely diagnosis can improve the quality of life of cataract patients. In this\npaper, a feature extraction-based method for grading cataract severity using\nretinal images is proposed. To obtain more appropriate features for the\nautomatic grading, the Haar wavelet is improved according to the\ncharacteristics of retinal images. Retinal images of non-cataract, as well as\nmild, moderate, and severe cataracts, are automatically recognized using the\nimproved Haar wavelet. A hierarchical strategy is used to transform the\nfour-class classification problem into three adjacent two-class classification\nproblems. Three sets of two-class classifiers based on a neural network are\ntrained individually and integrated together to establish a complete\nclassification system. The accuracies of the two-class classification (cataract\nand non-cataract) and four-class classification are 94.83% and 85.98%,\nrespectively. The performance analysis demonstrates that the improved Haar\nwavelet feature achieves higher accuracy than the original Haar wavelet\nfeature, and the fusion of three sets of two-class classifiers is superior to a\nsimple four-class classifier.

The neural network is trained such that\nthe output is as close to the input as possible, the data having gone through\nan information bottleneck : the latent space. This tool bears significant\nressemblance to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), with two main differences.\nFirstly, the autoencoder is a non-linear transformation, contrary to PCA, which\nmakes the autoencoder more flexible and powerful. Secondly, the axes found by a\nPCA are orthogonal, and are ordered in terms of the amount of variability which\nthe data presents along these axes. This makes the interpretability of the PCA\nmuch greater than that of the autoencoder, which does not have these\nattributes. Ideally, then, we would like an autoencoder whose latent space\nconsists of independent components, ordered by decreasing importance to the\ndata. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to create such a network. We\ncreate an iterative algorithm which progressively increases the size of the\nlatent space, learning a new dimension at each step. Secondly, we propose a\ncovariance loss term to add to the standard autoencoder loss function, as well\nas a normalisation layer just before the latent space, which encourages the\nlatent space components to be statistically independent. We demonstrate the\nresults of this autoencoder on simple geometric shapes, and find that the\nalgorithm indeed finds a meaningful representation in the latent space.

A very\nsimilar argumentation may yield an upper bound on the maximum mass of\nnonrotating NSs. We also discuss simulations of NS mergers, which undergo a\nfirst-order phase transition to quark matter. We point out a different\ndynamical behavior. Considering the gravitational-wave signal, we identify an\nunambiguous signature of the QCD phase transition in NS mergers. The occurrence\nof quark matter through a strong first-order phase transition during merging\nleads to a characteristic shift of the dominant postmerger frequency. The\nfrequency shift is indicative for a phase transition if it is compared to the\npostmerger frequency which is expected for purely hadronic EoS models. A very\nstrong deviation of several 100 Hz is observed for hybrid EoSs in an otherwise\ntight relation between the tidal deformability and the postmerger frequency. We\naddress the potential impact of a first-order phase transition on the\nelectromagnetic counterpart of NS mergers.

On one side, clustering groups training\nimages into pseudo-ID labels, and uses them to fine-tune the feature extractor.\nOn the other side, adversarial learning is used, inspired by domain adaptation,\nto match distributions from different domains. Since target data is distributed\nacross different camera viewpoints, we propose to model each camera as an\nindependent domain, and aim to learn domain-independent features.\nStraightforward adversarial learning yields negative transfer, we thus\nintroduce a conditioning vector to mitigate this undesirable effect.

These models therefore tend to create blurry\nimages or artefacts in tasks that require a strong 3D understanding, such as\nnovel-view synthesis. HoloGAN instead learns a 3D representation of the world,\nand to render this representation in a realistic manner. Unlike other GANs,\nHoloGAN provides explicit control over the pose of generated objects through\nrigid-body transformations of the learnt 3D features. Our experiments show that\nusing explicit 3D features enables HoloGAN to disentangle 3D pose and identity,\nwhich is further decomposed into shape and appearance, while still being able\nto generate images with similar or higher visual quality than other generative\nmodels. HoloGAN can be trained end-to-end from unlabelled 2D images only.\nParticularly, we do not require pose labels, 3D shapes, or multiple views of\nthe same objects.

The detection-based methods, on the other\nhand, have not been largely explored in recent trends of crowd counting due to\nthe needs for expensive bounding box annotations. In this work, we instead\npropose a new deep detection network with only point supervision required. It\ncan simultaneously detect the size and location of human heads and count them\nin crowds. We first mine useful person size information from point-level\nannotations and initialize the pseudo ground truth bounding boxes. An online\nupdating scheme is introduced to refine the pseudo ground truth during\ntraining; while a locally-constrained regression loss is designed to provide\nadditional constraints on the size of the predicted boxes in a local\nneighborhood.

Unfortunately, such attacks are extremely difficult to detect in\nreal-time due to cost and implementation constraints.

In particular, we leverage that channel state information (CSI)\nfrom Wi-Fi signals also perceives human activities in the place of interest in\naddition to surveillance cameras. SurFi processes and correlates the live video\nfeeds and the Wi-Fi CSI signals to detect any mismatches that would identify\nthe presence of the surveillance camera looping attacks. SurFi does not require\nthe deployment of additional infrastructure because Wi-Fi transceivers are\neasily found in the urban indoor environment.

However, this principle can be encoded differently,\ni.e., in different logico-algebraic objects. As a result, the logic of\nexperimental quantum propositions might have various semantics. E.g., it might\nhave either a total semantics, or a partial semantics (in which the valuation\nrelation -- i.e., a mapping from the set of atomic propositions to the set of\ntwo objects, 1 and 0 -- is not total), or a many-valued semantics (in which the\ngap between 1 and 0 is completed with truth degrees). Consequently, closed\nlinear subspaces of the Hilbert space representing experimental quantum\npropositions may be organized differently. For instance, they could be\norganized in the structure of a Hilbert lattice (or its generalizations)\nidentified with the bivalent semantics of quantum logic or in a structure\nidentified with a non-bivalent semantics. On the other hand, one can only\nverify -- at the same time -- propositions represented by the closed linear\nsubspaces corresponding to mutually commuting projection operators. This\nimplies that to decide which semantics is proper -- bivalent or non-bivalent --\nis not possible experimentally. Nevertheless, the latter allows simplification\nof certain no-go theorems in the foundation of quantum mechanics. In the\npresent paper, the Kochen-Specker theorem asserting the impossibility to\ninterpret, within the orthodox quantum formalism, projection operators as\ndefinite {0,1}-valued (pre-existent) properties, is taken as an example. The\npaper demonstrates that within the algebraic structure identified with\nsupervaluationism (the form of a partial, non-bivalent semantics), the\nstatement of this theorem gets deduced trivially.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 12:15:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 14:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

It takes metro network connection intermedia into\naccount and adopts network-based distance metric instead of Euclidean-based\ndistance metric, making it so-called adapted to the context of metro networks.\nThe real-world case of Shenzhen Metro is used to validate the superiority of\nour proposed model. The results show that the Ada-GWL model performs the best\ncompared with the global model (Ordinary Least Square (OLS), GWR, GWR\ncalibrated with network-based distance metric and GWL in terms of estimation\nerror of the dependent variable and goodness-of-fit. Through understanding the\nvariation of each coefficient across space (elasticities) and variables\nselection of each station, it provides more realistic conclusions based on\nlocal analysis. Besides, through clustering analysis of the stations according\nto the regression coefficients, clusters' functional characteristics are found\nto be in compliance with the facts of the functional land use policy of\nShenzhen. These results of the proposed Ada-GWL model demonstrate a great\nspatial explanatory power in transportation planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 12:44:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

Owing to their short lifespan, we expect a very low rate of\nsuch events in elliptical host galaxies, where the star-formation rate is low,\nand which mostly consist of an old stellar population. SN 2016hil (iPTF16hil)\nis a Type II supernova located in the extreme outskirts of an elliptical galaxy\nat redshift $z=0.0608$ (projected distance $27.2$ kpc). It was detected near\npeak brightness ($M_{r} \\approx -17$ mag) 9 days after the last nondetection.\nSN 2016hil has some potentially peculiar properties: while presenting a\ncharacteristic spectrum, the event was unusually short lived and declined by\n$\\sim 1.5$ mag in $< 40$ days, following an apparently double-peaked light\ncurve. Its spectra suggest a low metallicity ($Z<0.4\\ Z_{\\odot}$). We place a\ntentative upper limit on the mass of a potential faint host at\n$\\log(M/M_{\\odot}) =7.27^{+0.43}_{-0.24}$ using deep Keck optical imaging. In\nlight of this, we discuss the possibility of the progenitor forming locally,\nand other more exotic formation scenarios such as a merger or common-envelope\nevolution causing a time-delayed explosion. Further observations of the\nexplosion site in the ultraviolet are needed in order to distinguish between\nthe cases. Regardless of the origin of the transient, observing a population of\nsuch seemingly hostless Type II SNe could have many uses, including an estimate\nthe number of faint galaxies in a given volume, and tests of the prediction of\na time-delayed population of core-collapse SNe in locations otherwise\nunfavorable for the detection of such events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 13:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

Existing methods\noften iteratively search for the optimal geometric transformation to register a\ngiven pair of point sets, driven by minimizing a predefined alignment loss\nfunction. In contrast, the proposed point registration neural network (PR-Net)\nactively learns the registration pattern as a parametric function from a\ntraining dataset, consequently predict the desired geometric transformation to\nalign a pair of point sets. PR-Net can transfer the learned knowledge (i.e.\nregistration pattern) from registering training pairs to testing ones without\nadditional iterative optimization. Specifically, in this paper, we develop\nnovel techniques to learn shape descriptors from point sets that help formulate\na clear correlation between source and target point sets. With the defined\ncorrelation, PR-Net tends to predict the transformation so that the source and\ntarget point sets can be statistically aligned, which in turn leads to an\noptimal spatial geometric registration. PR-Net achieves robust and superior\nperformance for non-rigid registration of point sets, even in presence of\nGaussian noise, outliers, and missing points, but requires much less time for\nregistering large number of pairs. More importantly, for a new pair of point\nsets, PR-Net is able to directly predict the desired transformation using the\nlearned model without repetitive iterative optimization routine.

The outflow is known to\ncontain two prominent molecular bullets, namely B1 and B2, discovered from our\nprevious SMA CO J=2-1 observations.

We perform a large velocity gradient\nanalysis of the CO lines and derive a temperature of 70--210 K for B1 and\n20--50 K for B2. Taking into account the differences in the velocity, distance\nfrom the central source, excitation conditions, and chemistry between the two\nbullets, we suggest that the bullets are better explained by direct ejections\nfrom the innermost vicinity of the central high-mass protostar, and that we are\nmore likely observing the molecular component of a primary wind rather than\nentrained or swept-up material from the ambient cloud.

Although the FBs\nwere discovered 8 years ago, their origin and the nature of the gamma-ray\nemission are still unresolved. Understanding the properties of the FBs near the\nGalactic plane may provide a clue to their origin. Previous analyses of the\ngamma-ray emission at the base of the FBs, what remains after subtraction of\nGalactic foregrounds, have shown an increased intensity compared to the FBs at\nhigh latitudes, a hard power-law spectrum without evidence of a cutoff up to\napproximately 1 TeV, and a displacement of the emission to negative longitudes\nrelative to the GC. We analyze 9 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope data in\norder to study in more detail the gamma-ray emission at the base of the FBs,\nespecially at energies above 10 GeV. We confirm that the gamma-ray emission at\nthe base of the FBs is well described by a simple power law up to 1 TeV\nenergies. The 95% confidence lower limit on the cutoff energy is about 500 GeV.\nIt has larger intensity than the FBs emission at high latitudes and is shifted\nto the west (negative longitudes) from the GC. If the emission at the base of\nthe FBs is indeed connected to the high-latitude FBs, then the shift of the\nemission to negative longitudes disfavors models where the FBs are created by\nthe supermassive black hole at the GC. We find that the gamma-ray spectrum can\nbe explained either by gamma rays produced in hadronic interactions or by\nleptonic inverse Compton scattering. In the hadronic scenario, the emission at\nthe base of the FBs can be explained either by several hundred supernova\nremnants (SNRs) near the Galactic center or by about 10 SNRs at a distance of ~\n1 kpc. In the leptonic scenario, the necessary number of SNRs is a factor of a\nfew larger than in the hadronic scenario.

Using N-body simulations we simulate HI intensity maps\nand optical catalogues which share the same underlying cosmology.

Concrete implementations of\nthis approach exist, such as the OntoDebug plug-in for the ontology editor\nProt\\'eg\\'e.\n  To validate that a newly proposed method is favorable over an existing one,\nresearchers often rely on simulation-based comparisons. Such an evaluation\napproach however has certain limitations and often cannot fully inform us about\na method's true usefulness. We therefore conducted different user studies to\nassess the practical value of query-based ontology debugging. One main insight\nfrom the studies is that the considered interactive approach is indeed more\nefficient than an alternative algorithmic debugging based on test cases. We\nalso observed that users frequently made errors in the process, which\nhighlights the importance of a careful design of the queries that users need to\nanswer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 15:17:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2022 22:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-08"}

This study analytically confirms\nthat the transverse magnetic-field quantum annealing induces a first-order\nphase transition.

In the present study, we show that when the\nhydraulic radius of the inlet is instead used as the characteristic length, a\nsingle Strouhal-Richardson scaling relation is obtained for a variety of inlet\ngeometries. In particular, we use adaptive mesh numerical simulations to\nmeasure puffing Strouhal numbers for circular, rectangular (with three\ndifferent aspect ratios), triangular, and annular high-temperature buoyant jets\nover a range of Richardson numbers. We then combine these results with prior\nexperimental data for round and planar buoyant jets to propose a new scaling\nrelation that accurately describes puffing Strouhal numbers for various inlet\nshapes and for Richardson numbers spanning over four orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 15:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

We use the reduced MHD equations\nto describe the linear evolution of the poloidal flux and the toroidal\ncomponent of the vorticity in a full 3D system, coupled with equations of\ndensity and parallel velocity moments for the energetic particles species. We\nadd the Landau damping and resonant destabilization effects using a closure\nrelation. The simulations suggest that the helically trapped EP driven by the\nperpendicular neutral beam injector (NBI) further destabilizes the 1/1 MHD-like\nmode located at the plasma periphery (r/a = 0.88). If the beta of the EP driven\nby the perpendicular NBI is larger than 0.0025 a 1/1 EIC with a frequency\naround 3 kHz is destabilized. If the effect of the passing EP driven by the\ntangential NBI is included on the model, any enhancement of the injection\nintensity of the tangential NBI below beta=0.025 leads to a decrease of the\ninstability growth rate. The simulations indicate that the perpendicular NBI EP\nis the main driver of the EIC events, as it was observed in the experiment. If\nthe effect of the helical couplings are added in the model, an 11/13 EIC is\ndestabilized with a frequency around 9 kHz, inward shifted (r/a = 0.81)\ncompared to the 1/1 EIC. Thus, one possible explanation for the EIC frequency\nchirping down from 9 to 3 kHz is a transition between the 11/13 to the 1/1 EIC\ndue to a weakening of the destabilizing effect of the high n modes, caused by a\ndecrease of the EP drive due to a loss of helically trapped EP or a change in\nthe EP distribution function after the EIC burst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 03:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-04"}

We find that the only relevant thermal lens is represented\nby the $TeO_2$ crystal of the acousto-optic modulator exploited to adjust the\nlaser power on the atomic sample. We then devise a simple and totally passive\nscheme that enables to realize an inexpensive optical trapping apparatus\nessentially free from thermal lensing effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 23:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

The\nmulti-armed bandit field is currently flourishing, as novel problem settings\nand algorithms motivated by various practical applications are being\nintroduced, building on top of the classical bandit problem. This article aims\nto provide a comprehensive review of top recent developments in multiple\nreal-life applications of the multi-armed bandit. Specifically, we introduce a\ntaxonomy of common MAB-based applications and summarize state-of-art for each\nof those domains. Furthermore, we identify important current trends and provide\nnew perspectives pertaining to the future of this exciting and fast-growing\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 14:17:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

The\nimportance of learning feature interactions has been emphasized by many works.\nMany deep models are proposed to automatically learn high-order feature\ninteractions. Since most features in advertising system and recommendation\nsystem are high-dimensional sparse features, deep models usually learn a\nlow-dimensional distributed representation for each feature in the bottom\nlayer. Besides traditional fully-connected architectures, some new operations,\nsuch as convolutional operations and product operations, are proposed to learn\nfeature interactions better. In these models, the representation is shared\namong different operations. However, the best representation for different\noperations may be different. In this paper, we propose a new neural model named\nOperation-aware Neural Networks (ONN) which learns different representations\nfor different operations. Our experimental results on two large-scale\nreal-world ad click/conversion datasets demonstrate that ONN consistently\noutperforms the state-of-the-art models in both offline-training environment\nand online-training environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 15:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

The recent surge of activity in this area\ncan be attributed to the computational treatment of data, which made opinion\nextraction and sentiment analysis easier. This paper classifies tweets into\npositive and negative sentiments, but instead of using traditional methods or\npreprocessing text data here we use the distributed representations of words\nand sentences to classify the tweets. We use Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)\nNetworks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Artificial Neural Networks.\nThe first two are used on Distributed Representation of words while the latter\nis used on the distributed representation of sentences. This paper achieves\naccuracies as high as 81%.

In particular, we propose to use CAD\nmodels of the parts that are to be manufactured, introduce typical defects and\nsimulate XCT measurements. These simulated measurements were processed using\nFBP (computationally simple but result in noisy images) and the MBIR technique.\nWe then train a 2.5D deep convolutional neural network [4], deemed 2.5D Deep\nLearning MBIR (2.5D DL-MBIR), on these pairs of noisy and high-quality 3D\nvolumes to learn a fast, non-linear mapping function. The 2.5D DL-MBIR\nreconstructs a 3D volume in a 2.5D scheme where each slice is reconstructed\nfrom multiple inputs slices of the FBP input. Given this trained system, we can\ntake a small set of measurements on an actual part, process it using a\ncombination of FBP followed by 2.5D DL-MBIR. Both steps can be rapidly\nperformed using GPUs, resulting in a real-time algorithm that achieves the\nhigh-quality of MBIR as fast as standard techniques. Intuitively, since CAD\nmodels are typically available for parts to be manufactured, this provides a\nstrong constraint \"prior\" which can be leveraged to improve the reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 01:16:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 May 2019 10:45:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Both general\nrelativists and historians of the subject tend to share a view, General\nRelativity exceptionalism. But does some of the renaissance progress in\nunderstanding and justifying Einstein's equations owe something to particle\nphysics egalitarianism? If so, how should the historiography of gravitation and\nEinstein's equations reflect that fact?\n  The idea of a graviton mass has a 19th century Newtonian pre-history in\nNeumann's and Seeliger's long-distance modification of gravity, which\n(especially for Neumann) altered Poisson's equation to give a potential\n$e^{-mr}/r$ for a point mass, improving convergence for homogeneous matter.\nEinstein reinvented the idea before introducing his faulty analogy with\n$\\Lambda$. This confusion was first critiqued by Heckmann in the 1940s (without\neffect) and by Trautman, DeWitt, Treder, Rindler, and Freund et al. in the\n1960s, and especially more recently by Sch\\\"{u}cking, but it has misled North,\nJammer, Pais, Kerszberg, the Einstein Papers, and Kragh. The error is difficult\nto catch if one has an aversion to perturbative thinking, but difficult to make\nif one thinks along the lines of particle physics. The $\\Lambda$-graviton mass\nconfusion not only distorted the interpretation of Einstein's theory, but also\nobscured a potentially serious particle physics-motivated rivalry (massless vs.\nmassive spin 2). How could one entertain massive spin 2 gravity if $\\Lambda$ is\nthought already analogous to the Neumann-Seeliger scalar theory?\n  Historiography, like physics, is best served by overcoming the divide between\nthe two views of gravitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 11:07:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 18:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-19"}
