However, finding\nhighly efficient thermoelectrics with high figures of merit, zT$\\geq$1, is very\nchallenging because the combination of high power factor and low thermal\nconductivity is rare in materials. Here, we use first-principles methods to\nanalyze the thermoelectric properties of Li$_2$Sn$X_3$ ($X$=S,Se), a recently\nsynthesized class of lithium fast-ion conductors presenting high thermal\nstability. In p-type Li$_2$Sn$X_3$, we estimate highly flat electronic valence\nbands that render high Seebeck coefficients exceeding 400 ${\\mu}$VK$^{-1}$ at\n700K. In n-type Li$_2$Sn$X_3$, the electronic conduction bands are slightly\ndispersive however the accompanying weak electron-acoustic phonon scattering\ninduces high electrical conductivity. The combination of high Seebeck\ncoefficient and electrical conductivity gives rise to high power factors,\nreaching a maximum of 4 mWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ in p-type Li$_2$SnS$_3$ and 8\nmWm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ in n-type Li$_2$SnSe$_3$ at 300 K. Likewise, the thermal\nconductivity in Li$_2$Sn$X_3$ is low as compared to conventional thermoelectric\nmaterials, 2-5 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at room temperature. As a result, we estimate\na maximum zT = 1.05 in p-type Li$_2$SnS$_3$ at 700 K and an extraordinary 3.07\n(1.5) in n-type Li$_2$SnSe$_3$ at the same temperature (300 K). Our findings of\nhuge zT in Li$_2$Sn$X_3$ suggest that lithium fast-ion conductors, typically\nemployed as electrolytes in solid-state batteries, hold exceptional promise as\nthermoelectric materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2019 16:02:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 2019 05:10:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

Such algorithms have been shown to be useful in\nmultiplayer settings, e.g. to solve the wireless network selection problem,\nwhich can be formulated as an adversarial bandit problem. A leading bandit\nalgorithm for the adversarial setting is EXP3. However, network behavior is\noften repetitive, where user density and network behavior follow regular\npatterns. Bandit algorithms, like EXP3, fail to provide good guarantees for\nperiodic behaviors. A major reason is that these algorithms compete against\nfixed-action policies, which is ineffective in a periodic setting.\n  In this paper, we define a periodic bandit setting, and periodic regret as a\nbetter performance measure for this type of setting. Instead of comparing an\nalgorithm's performance to fixed-action policies, we aim to be competitive with\npolicies that play arms under some set of possible periodic patterns $F$ (for\nexample, all possible periodic functions with periods $1,2,\\cdots,P$). We\npropose Periodic EXP4, a computationally efficient variant of the EXP4\nalgorithm for periodic settings. With $K$ arms, $T$ time steps, and where each\nperiodic pattern in $F$ is of length at most $P$, we show that the periodic\nregret obtained by Periodic EXP4 is at most $O\\big(\\sqrt{PKT \\log K + KT \\log\n|F|}\\big)$. We also prove a lower bound of $\\Omega\\big(\\sqrt{PKT + KT\n\\frac{\\log |F|}{\\log K}} \\big)$ for the periodic setting, showing that this is\noptimal within log-factors. As an example, we focus on the wireless network\nselection problem. Through simulation, we show that Periodic EXP4 learns the\nperiodic pattern over time, adapts to changes in a dynamic environment, and far\noutperforms EXP3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2019 17:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

In this work, we explore the use of imperfect 3D content, for instance,\nobtained from photo-metric reconstructions with noisy and incomplete surface\ngeometry, while still aiming to produce photo-realistic (re-)renderings. To\naddress this challenging problem, we introduce Deferred Neural Rendering, a new\nparadigm for image synthesis that combines the traditional graphics pipeline\nwith learnable components. Specifically, we propose Neural Textures, which are\nlearned feature maps that are trained as part of the scene capture process.\nSimilar to traditional textures, neural textures are stored as maps on top of\n3D mesh proxies; however, the high-dimensional feature maps contain\nsignificantly more information, which can be interpreted by our new deferred\nneural rendering pipeline. Both neural textures and deferred neural renderer\nare trained end-to-end, enabling us to synthesize photo-realistic images even\nwhen the original 3D content was imperfect. In contrast to traditional,\nblack-box 2D generative neural networks, our 3D representation gives us\nexplicit control over the generated output, and allows for a wide range of\napplication domains. For instance, we can synthesize temporally-consistent\nvideo re-renderings of recorded 3D scenes as our representation is inherently\nembedded in 3D space. This way, neural textures can be utilized to coherently\nre-render or manipulate existing video content in both static and dynamic\nenvironments at real-time rates.

In the contrast learning\nstep, all the samples in the 3D object dataset are cut into two parts and put\ninto a \"part\" dataset. Then a contrast learning GNN (ContrastNet) is trained to\nverify whether two randomly sampled parts from the part dataset belong to the\nsame object. In the cluster learning step, the trained ContrastNet is applied\nto all the samples in the original 3D object dataset to extract features, which\nare used to group the samples into clusters. Then another GNN for clustering\nlearning (ClusterNet) is trained to predict the cluster ID of all the training\nsamples. The contrasting learning forces the ContrastNet to learn high-level\nsemantic features of objects but probably ignores low-level features, while the\nClusterNet improves the quality of learned features by being trained to\ndiscover objects that probably belong to the same semantic categories by the\nuse of cluster IDs.

Prior art in filter pruning requires users to specify a\ntarget model complexity (e.g., model size or FLOP count) for the resulting\narchitecture. However, determining a target model complexity can be difficult\nfor optimizing various embodied AI applications such as autonomous robots,\ndrones, and user-facing applications. First, both the accuracy and the speed of\nConvNets can affect the performance of the application. Second, the performance\nof the application can be hard to assess without evaluating ConvNets during\ninference. As a consequence, finding a sweet-spot between the accuracy and\nspeed via filter pruning, which needs to be done in a trial-and-error fashion,\ncan be time-consuming. This work takes a first step toward making this process\nmore efficient by altering the goal of model compression to producing a set of\nConvNets with various accuracy and latency trade-offs instead of producing one\nConvNet targeting some pre-defined latency constraint. To this end, we propose\nto learn a global ranking of the filters across different layers of the\nConvNet, which is used to obtain a set of ConvNet architectures that have\ndifferent accuracy/latency trade-offs by pruning the bottom-ranked filters.

We now use this effective\nHamiltonian to study the interior region of a Schwarzschild black hole, where a\nhomogeneous foliation is available. Descending from the full theory, our\neffective Hamiltonian, though still bearing the well known ambiguities of the\nquantum Hamiltonian operator, preserves all relevant information about the\nfundamental discreteness of quantum space. This allows us to have a uniform\ntreatment for all quantum gravity holonomy corrections to spatially homogeneous\ngeometries, unlike the minisuperspace loop quantization models in which the\neffective Hamiltonian is postulated. We show how, for several geometrically and\nphysically well motivated choices of coherent states, the classical black hole\nsingularity is replaced by a homogeneous expanding Universe. The resultant\ngeometries have no significant deviations from the classical Schwarzschild\ngeometry in the pre-bounce sub-Planckian curvature regime, evidencing the fact\nthat large quantum effects are avoided in these models. In all cases, we find\nno evidence of a white hole horizon formation.

These motors rely on energy derived from ATP,\nsupplied, in part, by diffusion from the sarcoplasm to the interior of the\nlattice of actin and myosin filaments. The radial spacing of filaments in this\nlattice may change or remain constant during contraction. If the lattice is\nisovolumetric, it must expand when the muscle shortens. If, however, the\nspacing is constant or has a different pattern of axial and radial motion, then\nthe lattice changes volume during contraction, driving fluid motion and\nassisting in the transport of molecules between the contractile lattice and the\nsurrounding intracellular space. We first create an\nadvective-diffusive-reaction flow model and show that the flow into and out of\nthe sarcomere lattice would be significant in the absence of lattice expansion.\nAdvective transport coupled to diffusion has the potential to substantially\nenhance metabolite exchange within the crowded sarcomere. Using time-resolved\nx-ray diffraction of contracting muscle, we next show that the contractile\nlattice is neither isovolumetric nor constant in spacing. Instead, lattice\nspacing is time-varying, depends on activation, and can manifest as an\neffective time-varying Poisson ratio. The resulting fluid flow in the sarcomere\nlattice of synchronous insect flight muscles is greater than expected for\nconstant lattice spacing conditions. Lattice spacing depends on a variety of\nfactors that produce radial force, including crossbridges, titin-like\nmolecules, and other structural proteins. Volume change and advective transport\nvaries with the phase of muscle stimulation but remains significant at all\nconditions. Akin to \"breathing,\" advective-diffusive transport in sarcomeres is\nsufficient to promote metabolite exchange and may play a role in the regulation\nof contraction itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 02:08:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 22:13:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 19:43:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

Since the problem of computing an optimal coloring, or even\napproximating it to within $n^{1-\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$, is NP-hard\nin static graphs, there is no hope to achieve any meaningful computational\nresults for general graphs in the dynamic setting. It is therefore only natural\nto consider the combinatorial aspects of dynamic coloring, or alternatively,\nstudy restricted families of graphs.\n  Towards understanding the combinatorial aspects of this problem, one may\nassume a black-box access to a static algorithm for $C$-coloring any subgraph\nof the dynamic graph, and investigate the trade-off between the number of\ncolors and the number of recolorings per update step. In WADS'17, Barba et al.\ndevised two complementary algorithms: For any $\\beta > 0$ the first\n(respectively, second) maintains an $O(C \\beta n^{1/\\beta})$ (resp., $O(C\n\\beta)$)-coloring while recoloring $O(\\beta)$ (resp., $O(\\beta n^{1/\\beta})$)\nvertices per update. Our contribution is two-fold:\n  - We devise a new algorithm for general graphs that improves significantly\nupon the first trade-off in a wide range of parameters: For any $\\beta > 0$, we\nget a $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{C}{\\beta}\\log^2 n)$-coloring with $O(\\beta)$ recolorings\nper update, where the $\\tilde{O}$ notation supresses polyloglog$(n)$ factors.\nIn particular, for $\\beta=O(1)$ we get constant recolorings with polylog$(n)$\ncolors; this is an exponential improvement over the previous bound.\n  - For uniformly sparse graphs, we use low out-degree orientations to\nstrengthen the above result by bounding the update time of the algorithm rather\nthan the number of recolorings. Then, we further improve this result by\nintroducing a new data structure that refines bounded out-degree edge\norientations and is of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 02:45:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:07:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 18:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

However, existing UIT schemes defect\nin the need of supervised training, as well as the lack of encoding domain\ninformation. In this paper, we propose an Attribute Guided UIT model termed\nAGUIT to tackle these two challenges. AGUIT considers multi-modal and\nmulti-domain tasks of UIT jointly with a novel semi-supervised setting, which\nalso merits in representation disentanglement and fine control of outputs.\nEspecially, AGUIT benefits from two-fold: (1) It adopts a novel semi-supervised\nlearning process by translating attributes of labeled data to unlabeled data,\nand then reconstructing the unlabeled data by a cycle consistency operation.\n(2) It decomposes image representation into domain-invariant content code and\ndomain-specific style code. The redesigned style code embeds image style into\ntwo variables drawn from standard Gaussian distribution and the distribution of\ndomain label, which facilitates the fine control of translation due to the\ncontinuity of both variables. Finally, we introduce a new challenge, i.e.,\ndisentangled transfer, for UIT models, which adopts the disentangled\nrepresentation to translate data less related with the training set. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the capacity of AGUIT over existing state-of-the-art\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 02:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

Using new data from the K2 mission, which has a\nwell-defined selection function, we find that an old metal-poor thick disc, as\nused in previous Galactic models, is incompatible with the asteroseismic\ninformation. We show that spectroscopic measurements of [Fe/H] and\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] elemental abundances from the GALAH survey indicate a mean\nmetallicity of $\\log (Z/Z_{\\odot})=-0.16$ for the thick disc. Here $Z$ is the\neffective solar-scaled metallicity, which is a function of [Fe/H] and\n[$\\alpha$/Fe]. With the revised disc metallicities, for the first time, the\ntheoretically predicted distribution of seismic masses show excellent agreement\nwith the observed distribution of masses. This provides an indirect\nverification of the asteroseismic mass scaling relation is good to within five\npercent. Using an importance-sampling framework that takes the selection\nfunction into account, we fit a population synthesis model of the Galaxy to the\nobserved seismic and spectroscopic data. Assuming the asteroseismic scaling\nrelations are correct, we estimate the mean age of the thick disc to be about\n10 Gyr, in agreement with the traditional idea of an old $\\alpha$-enhanced\nthick disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 04:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

Despite the importance of these\nsystems, their microscopic structure is understood only on a rudimentary level,\nthus in stark contrast to the case of gases and crystals [1,4]. Experimental\nand theoretical investigations indicate that disordered systems have a\nstructural order on the length scale of a few particle diameters but which then\nquickly vanishes at larger distances [5]. This conclusion is, however, based\nmainly on the behavior of two-point correlation functions such as the static\nstructure factor or the radial distribution function [5.6]. Whether or not\ndisordered systems have an order that extents to larger length scales is\ntherefore a highly important question that is still open [7-10]. Here we use\ncomputer simulations to show that liquids have an intricate structural order\ngiven by alternating layers with icosahedral and dodecahedral symmetries and\nwhich extends to surprisingly large distances. We show that the temperature\ndependence of the corresponding length scale can be detected in the static\nstructure factor, making it directly accessible to scattering experiments.\nThese results, obtained by a novel type of four point correlation function that\nprobes directly the particle density in three dimensions, show that liquids are\nfar more ordered than envisaged so far but that this structural information is\nencoded in non-standard correlation functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 04:48:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

Previous studies on the entanglement properties of\nquenched quantum many-body systems mainly focus on the growth of entanglement\nentropy. Several rigorous results and phenomenological guiding principles have\nbeen established, such as the no-faster-than-linear entanglement growth\ngenerated by generic local Hamiltonians and the peculiar logarithmic growth for\nmany-body localized systems. However, little is known about the dynamical\nbehavior of the full entanglement spectrum, which is a refined character\nclosely related to the topological nature of the wave function. Here, we\nestablish a rigorous and universal result for the entanglement spectra of 1D\nSPT systems evolving out of equilibrium. Our result is derived both for\nfree-fermion SPT systems and interacting ones. For free-fermion systems with AZ\nsymmetries, we prove that the single-particle entanglement gap after quenches\nobeys essentially the same Lieb-Robinson bound as that on the equal-time\ncorrelation, provided that there is no dynamical symmetry breaking. As a\nnotable byproduct, we obtain a new type of Lieb-Robinson velocity which is\nrelated to the band dispersion with a complex wave number and reaches the\nminimum as the maximal (relative) group velocity. Within the framework of\ntensor networks, i.e., for SPT MPSs evolved by symmetric and trivial MPUs, we\nalso identify a Lieb-Robinson bound on the many-body entanglement gap for\ngeneral quenched interacting SPT systems. This result suggests high potential\nof tensor-network approaches for exploring rigorous results on long-time\nquantum dynamics. Influence of partial symmetry breaking, effects of disorder,\nand the relaxation property in the long-time limit are also discussed.

The attention map is then fed into the CapsNet\nprimary layer that is followed by a classification layer.

Sensing is based on opto-mechanical, forward\nstimulated Brillouin scattering interactions between guided light and sound\nwaves. In most previous works, however, the protective polymer coating of the\nfiber had to be removed first.

The dynamics of a low-mass protoplanet accreting solids is\ninfluenced by the heating torque, which was found to suppress inward migration\nin protoplanetary disks with constant opacities.\n  Aims. We investigate the differences of the heating torque between disks with\nconstant and temperature-dependent opacities.\n  Methods. Interactions of a super-Earth-sized protoplanet with the gas disk\nare explored using 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations.\n  Results. Accretion heating of the protoplanet creates a hot underdense region\nin the surrounding gas, leading to misalignment of the local density and\npressure gradients. As a result, the 3D gas flow is perturbed and some of the\nstreamlines form a retrograde spiral rising above the protoplanet. In the\nconstant-opacity disk, the perturbed flow reaches a steady state and the\nunderdense gas responsible for the heating torque remains distributed in\naccordance with previous studies. If the opacity is non-uniform, however, the\ndifferences in the disk structure can lead to more vigorous streamline\ndistortion and eventually to a flow instability. The underdense gas develops a\none-sided asymmetry which circulates around the protoplanet in a retrograde\nfashion. The heating torque thus strongly oscillates in time and does not on\naverage counteract inward migration.\n  Conclusions. The torque variations make the radial drift of the protoplanet\noscillatory, consisting of short intervals of alternating rapid inward and\noutward migration. We speculate that transitions between the positive and\noscillatory heating torque may occur in specific disk regions susceptible to\nvertical convection, resulting in the convergent migration of multiple\nplanetary embryos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 08:46:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

The wide area and deep radio and optical data of XXL-S have allowed\nthe construction of the radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of the RL HERGs and\nLERGs across a wide range in radio luminosity out to high redshift ($z = 1.3$).\nThe LERG RLFs display weak evolution: $\\Phi (z)$ $\\propto$ (1+$z$)$^{0.67 \\pm\n0.17}$ in the pure density evolution (PDE) case and $\\Phi (z)$ $\\propto$\n(1+$z$)$^{0.84 \\pm 0.31}$ in the pure luminosity evolution (PLE) case.

Under\nreverse bias (negative bias on the GaN cap segment), the detectors behave\nlinearly with the impinging optical power when the nanowire diameter is below a\ncertain threshold ($\\approx$ 80 nm), which corresponds to the total depletion\nof the nanowire stem due to the Fermi level pinning at the sidewalls. In the\ncase of nanowires that are only partially depleted, their nonlinearity is\nexplained by a nonlinear variation of the diameter of their central conducting\nchannel under illumination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 09:07:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

The atmospheric conditions in the solar chromosphere allow both\nionised and neutral particles to exist and interact. Under such conditions,\nfine substructures exist within slow-mode shocks due to the decoupling and\nrecoupling of the plasma and neutral species. We study numerically the fine\nsubstructure within slow-mode shocks in a partially ionised plasma, in\nparticular, analysing the formation of an intermediate transition within the\nslow-mode shock. High-resolution 1D numerical simulations are performed using\nthe (P\\underline{I}P) code using a two-fluid approach. We discover that\nlong-lived intermediate (Alfven) shocks can form within the slow-mode shock,\nwhere there is a shock transition from above to below the Alfven speed and a\nreversal of the magnetic field across the shock front. The collisional coupling\nprovides frictional heating to the neutral fluid, resulting in a\nSedov-Taylor-like expansion with overshoots in the neutral velocity and neutral\ndensity. The increase in density results in a decrease of the Alfven speed and\nwith this the plasma inflow is accelerated to above the Alfven speed within the\nfinite width of the shock leading to the intermediate transition. This process\noccurs for a wide range of physical parameters and an intermediate shock is\npresent for all investigated values of plasma-$\\beta$, neutral fraction, and\nmagnetic angle. As time advances the magnitude of the magnetic field reversal\ndecreases since the neutral pressure cannot balance the Lorentz force. The\nintermediate shock is long-lived enough to be considered a physical structure,\nindependent of the initial conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 09:09:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

After pursuing a comprehensive analysis of the\nTyper phenomenon and the attacking mechanism of CAPTCHA, we present a new\nCAPTCHA design principle to distinguish human (Typer) from human (user). The\ncore idea is that the challenge process of the CAPTCHA should contain the\nunique information with a private attribute. The notion of our idea is based on\nthe information asymmetry between humans. Without this private information,\nTypers will not be able to finish the attack even if they recognize all the\ncharacters from the CAPTCHA.\n  We formalize, design and implement two examples on our proposed principle, a\ncharacter-based, and a datagram-based case, according to a web interaction and\npassword handling program.

In the present paper it is demonstrated that a shock is always\ndeveloped at moving wetting-drying frontiers, and this justifies the study of\nthe Riemann problem on even and uneven beds. In particular, the general exact\nsolution for the Riemann problem on horizontal frictionless bed is given,\ntogether with the exact solution of the non-breaking wave propagating on\nhorizontal bed with friction, while some example solution is given for the\nRiemann problem on discontinuous bed. From this analysis, it follows that\ndrying of the wet bed is forbidden in the LInA model, and that there are\ninitial conditions for which the Riemann problem has no solution on smoothly\nvarying bed. In addition, propagation of the flood on discontinuous sloping bed\nis impossible if the bed drops height have the same order of magnitude of the\nmoving-frontier shock height. Finally, it is found that the conservation of the\nmechanical energy is violated. It is evident that all these findings pose a\nsevere limit to the application of the model. The numerical analysis has proven\nthat LInA numerical models may produce numerical solutions, which are\nunreliable because of mere algorithmic nature, also in the case that the LInA\nmathematical solutions do not exist. The applicability limits of the LInA model\nare discouragingly severe, even if the bed elevation varies continuously. More\nimportant, the non-existence of the LInA solution in the case of discontinuous\ntopography and the non-existence of receding fronts radically question the\nviability of the LInA model in realistic cases.

An F-node represents a permutation\nthat is fixed, i.e., it cannot be reversed. Let $G$ be a graph such that every\nvertex of $G$ is equipped with a set of FPQ-trees encoding hierarchical\nembedding constraints for its incident edges.

The quantum field description of the photon mode allows to\nmanipulate the light-matter interaction directly in phase-space. In this paper\nwe will demonstrate the basic principle of coherent control with quantum light\non the avoided crossing in lithium fluoride. Using a quantum description of\nlight together with the nonadiabatic couplings and vibronic degrees of freedoms\nopens up new perspective on quantum control.

Our aim\nis to measure the masses, radii and ages of the stars in five low-mass\neclipsing binary systems discovered by the WASP survey. We use WASP photometry\nto establish eclipse-time ephemerides and to obtain initial estimates for the\ntransit depth and width. Radial velocity measurements were simultaneously\nfitted with follow-up photometry to find the best-fitting orbital solution.\nThis solution was combined with measurements of atmospheric parameters to\ninterpolate evolutionary models and estimate the mass of the primary star, and\nthe mass and radius of the M-dwarf companion. We assess how the best fitting\norbital solution changes if an alternative limb-darkening law is used and\nquantify the systematic effects of unresolved companions. We also gauge how the\nbest-fitting evolutionary model changes if different values are used for the\nmixing length parameter and helium enhancement. We report the mass and radius\nof five M-dwarfs and find little evidence of inflation with respect to\nevolutionary models. The primary stars in two systems are near the ``blue\nhook'' stage of their post sequence evolution, resulting in two possible\nsolutions for mass and age.

Atlanta\nworld assumption, which can be considered as a generalized Manhattan world\nassumption, has one vertical frame and multiple horizontal frames.\nConventionally, given a set of inputs such as surface normals, the Atlanta\nframe estimation problem can be solved in one-time by branch-and-bound (BnB).\nHowever, the runtime of the BnB algorithm will increase greatly when the\ndimensionality (i.e., the number of horizontal frames) increases.

For the latter, intermediate cues, such as 3D object coordinates,\nsemantic keypoints, or virtual control points instead of pose parameters are\nregressed by CNN in the first stage.

In this\npaper, we focus on the postprocessing of a two-stage pipeline and propose to\ncombine two learning concepts for estimating object pose under challenging\nscenes: projection grouping on one side, and correspondence learning on the\nother. We firstly employ a local patch based method to predict projection\nheatmaps which denote the confidence distribution of projection of 3D bounding\nbox's corners. A projection grouping module is then proposed to remove\nredundant local maxima from each layer of heatmaps. Instead of directly feeding\n2D-3D correspondences to the perspective-n-point (PnP) algorithm, multiple\ncorrespondence hypotheses are sampled from local maxima and its corresponding\nneighborhood and ranked by a correspondence-evaluation network. Finally,\ncorrespondences with higher confidence are selected to determine object pose.\nExtensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed\nframework outperforms several state of the art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 14:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}

We argue that the observed sample can be split\ninto three distinct sub-populations based on their orbital characteristics: (i)\nshort-period, low-eccentricity binaries; (ii) wide binaries; and (iii)\nshort-period, high-eccentricity binaries. These sub-populations also exhibit\ndistinct spin period and spindown rate properties. We focus on sub-population\n(iii), which contains the Hulse-Taylor binary. Contrary to previous analysis,\nwe demonstrate that, if they are the product of primordial binary evolution,\nthe $P_{\\rm orb}$ and $e$ distribution of these systems requires that the\nsecond-born NSs must have been formed with small natal kicks ($\\lesssim$25 km\ns$^{-1}$) and have pre-SN masses narrowly distributed around 3.2 M$_{\\odot}$.\nThese constraints challenge binary evolution theory and further predict closely\naligned spin and orbital axes, inconsistent with the Hulse-Taylor binary's\nmeasured spin-orbit misalignment angle of $\\approx$20$^{\\circ}$.

First, analytical solutions are presented for the\noverdamped case, both for linear swimmers and circle swimmers. For a frame\nrotating with constant angular velocity (\"carousel\"), the resulting noise-free\ntrajectories in the static laboratory frame trochoids if these are circles in\nthe rotating frame. For systems governed by inertia, such as vibrated\ngranulates or active complex plasmas, centrifugal and Coriolis forces become\nrelevant. For both linear and circling self-propulsion, these forces lead to\nout-spiraling trajectories which for long times approach a spira mirabilis.\nThis implies that a self-propelled particle will typically leave a rotating\ncarousel. A navigation strategy is proposed to avoid this expulsion, by\nadjusting the self-propulsion direction at wish. For a particle, initially\nquiescent in the rotating frame, it is shown that this strategy only works if\nthe initial distance to the rotation centre is smaller than a critical radius\nRc which scales with the self-propulsion velocity.

A target connected shape $B$ is also provided and the goal is to\n\\emph{transform} $A$ into $B$ via a sequence of line movements.

We overcome this\nproblem by extracting a commute-time minimum spanning tree from the complete\nweighted graph. The spanning tree is probed by a discrete time quantum walk\nwhich is initialised using a weighted version of the Perron-Frobenius operator.\nThis naturally encapsulates the edge weight information for the spanning tree\nextracted from the original graph.

On the other hand, pointwise divergence-free\n$H(\\operatorname{div})$-conforming approaches ensure exact mass conservation\nand energy stability by the use of tailored finite element function spaces. The\npresent work raises the question whether and to which extent these two\napproaches are equivalent when applied to under-resolved turbulent flows. This\ncomparative study highlights similarities and differences of these two\napproaches. The numerical results emphasise that both discretisation strategies\nare promising for under-resolved simulations of turbulent flows due to their\ninherent dissipation mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 11:17:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

A promising approach to\naddress these problems is quantization. However, uniformly quantizing a model\nto ultra low precision leads to significant accuracy degradation. A novel\nsolution for this is to use mixed-precision quantization, as some parts of the\nnetwork may allow lower precision as compared to other layers. However, there\nis no systematic way to determine the precision of different layers. A brute\nforce approach is not feasible for deep networks, as the search space for\nmixed-precision is exponential in the number of layers. Another challenge is a\nsimilar factorial complexity for determining block-wise fine-tuning order when\nquantizing the model to a target precision. Here, we introduce Hessian AWare\nQuantization (HAWQ), a novel second-order quantization method to address these\nproblems. HAWQ allows for the automatic selection of the relative quantization\nprecision of each layer, based on the layer's Hessian spectrum. Moreover, HAWQ\nprovides a deterministic fine-tuning order for quantizing layers, based on\nsecond-order information. We show the results of our method on Cifar-10 using\nResNet20, and on ImageNet using Inception-V3, ResNet50 and SqueezeNext models.\nComparing HAWQ with state-of-the-art shows that we can achieve similar/better\naccuracy with $8\\times$ activation compression ratio on ResNet20, as compared\nto DNAS~\\cite{wu2018mixed}, and up to $1\\%$ higher accuracy with up to $14\\%$\nsmaller models on ResNet50 and Inception-V3, compared to recently proposed\nmethods of RVQuant~\\cite{park2018value} and HAQ~\\cite{wang2018haq}.\nFurthermore, we show that we can quantize SqueezeNext to just 1MB model size\nwhile achieving above $68\\%$ top1 accuracy on ImageNet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 06:49:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-29"}
