For the choice of analytic\ncontinuation consistent with the 4d/5d lift, we find that the most general\nlocalization solution for the five-dimensional black hole problem is\nan~$(n_\\text{v}+1)$-dimensional manifold, which is precisely the lift of the\nlocalization manifold for supersymmetric black holes in four-dimensional\nasymptotically flat space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 16:30:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

This study is based on the stationary, two-dimensional ($x$ and\n$z$), two-beam, monochromatic neutrino line model with a periodic boundary\ncondition along the $x$ direction. Similar to a previous work, we find that\nsmall-scale flavor structures can develop in a neutrino gas even if the\nphysical conditions are nearly homogeneous along the $x$ axis initially. The\npower diffusion from the large-scale to small-scale structures increases with\nthe neutrino density and helps to establish a semi-exponential dependence of\nthe magnitudes of the Fourier moments on the corresponding wave numbers. The\noverall flavor conversion probabilities in the neutrino gases with small\ninitial sinusoidal perturbations reach certain equilibrium values at large\ndistances which are mainly determined by the neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry.\nSimilar phenomena also exist in a neutrino gas with a localized initial\nperturbation, albeit only inside an expanding flavor conversion region. Our\nwork suggests that a statistical treatment may be possible for the collective\nflavor oscillations of a dense neutrino gas in a multi-dimensional environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 16:31:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 22:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

Further, we calculate the histogram based entropy and\ncross entropy between the original image and the enhanced one respectively, to\ngain a sum of 4 features.

For random $k$-SAT and related models it happens at clause\ndensity $\\alpha$ around $2^k$. Just below the threshold, further results\nsuggest that the solution space has a \"1RSB\" structure of a large bounded\nnumber of near-orthogonal clusters inside the space of variable assignments\n$\\{0,1\\}^N$. In the unsatisfiable regime, it is natural to consider\nmax-satisfiability: violating the least number of constraints. For a simplified\nvariant, the strong refutation problem, there is strong evidence that an\nalgorithmic transition occurs around $\\alpha = N^{k/2-1}$. For $\\alpha$ bounded\nin $N$, a very precise estimate of the max-sat value was obtained by\nAchlioptas, Naor, and Peres (2007), but it is not sharp enough to indicate the\nnature of the energy landscape. Later work (Sen, 2016; Panchenko, 2016) shows\nthat for $\\alpha$ very large (roughly, above $64^k$) the max-sat value\napproaches the mean-field (complete graph) limit: this is conjectured to have\nan \"FRSB\" structure where near-optimal configurations form clusters within\nclusters, in an ultrametric hierarchy of infinite depth inside $\\{0,1\\}^N$. A\nstronger form of FRSB was shown in several recent works to have algorithmic\nimplications (again, in complete graphs). Consequently we find it of interest\nto understand how the model transitions from 1RSB near the satisfiability\nthreshold, to (conjecturally) FRSB for large $\\alpha$. In this paper we show\nthat in the random regular $k$-NAE-SAT model, the 1RSB description breaks down\nalready above $\\alpha \\asymp 4^k/k^3$.

CornerNet-Lite is a combination of two\nefficient variants of CornerNet: CornerNet-Saccade, which uses an attention\nmechanism to eliminate the need for exhaustively processing all pixels of the\nimage, and CornerNet-Squeeze, which introduces a new compact backbone\narchitecture. Together these two variants address the two critical use cases in\nefficient object detection: improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy,\nand improving accuracy at real-time efficiency. CornerNet-Saccade is suitable\nfor offline processing, improving the efficiency of CornerNet by 6.0x and the\nAP by 1.0% on COCO. CornerNet-Squeeze is suitable for real-time detection,\nimproving both the efficiency and accuracy of the popular real-time detector\nYOLOv3 (34.4% AP at 30ms for CornerNet-Squeeze compared to 33.0% AP at 39ms for\nYOLOv3 on COCO). Together these contributions for the first time reveal the\npotential of keypoint-based detection to be useful for applications requiring\nprocessing efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 17:21:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 23:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-18"}

The common\nassumption for blockchain networks like Bitcoin is that forcing nodes to erase\ndata contained on the blockchain is equal to permanently restricting them from\nparticipating in the system in a full-node role. Challenging this belief, in\nthis paper, we propose and demonstrate a pragmatic approach towards\nfunctionality-preserving local erasure (FPLE). FPLE enables full nodes to erase\ninfringing or undesirable data while continuing to store and validate most of\nthe blockchain. We describe a general FPLE approach for UTXO-based (i.e.,\nBitcoin-like) cryptocurrencies and present a lightweight proof-of-concept tool\nfor safely erasing transaction data from the local storage of Bitcoin Core\nnodes. Erasing nodes continue to operate in tune with the network even when\nerased transaction outputs become relevant for validating subsequent blocks.\nUsing only our basic proof-of-concept implementation, we are already able to\nsafely comply with a significantly larger range of erasure requests than, to\nthe best of our knowledge, any other full node operator so far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 17:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}

The equation for\n$\\gamma(x)$ is found to be the Fractional Yamabe Equation (to be solved in\n$\\Omega$) that, in absence of anomalous dimension, reduces to the usual Yamabe\nEquation in the same domain. From the scale factor $\\gamma(x)$ we obtain novel\npredictions for the scaling form of one-point correlation functions. A\n(necessary) virtue of the proposed approach is that it encodes and allows to\nnaturally retrieve the purely geometric content of two-dimensional boundary\nconformal field theory.

When we consider the thermodynamic profiles in two dimensions, we find\nthat the cooling is highly asymmetric. The bulk of the cooling in the inner ~20\nkpc is confined to a low-entropy filament extending northward from the central\ngalaxy. We detect a substantial reservoir of cool (10^4 K) gas (as traced by\nthe [OII] doublet), which is coincident with the low-entropy filament.

MapReduce offers a streamlined\ncomputational framework by interleaving sequential and parallel computation\nwhile hiding underlying system issues from the programmer. Due to the\npopularity of MapReduce, there have been attempts in the theoretical computer\nscience community to understand the power and limitations of the MapReduce\nframework. In the most widely studied MapReduce models each machine has memory\nsub-linear in the input size to the problem, hence cannot see the entire input.\nThis restriction places many limitations on algorithms that can be developed\nfor the model; however, the current understanding of these restrictions is\nstill limited.\n  In this paper, our goal is to work towards understanding problems which do\nnot admit efficient algorithms in the MapReduce model. We study the basic\nquestion of determining if a graph is connected or not. We concentrate on\ninstances of this problem where an algorithm is to determine if a graph\nconsists of a single cycle or two disconnected cycles. In this problem, locally\nevery part of the graph is similar and the goal is to determine the global\nstructure of the graph.

We also discuss that, for some large chemical potential values,\nthe explicit center-symmetry breaking is so strong that statistical\ndeconfinement is realized at infinitely small temperatures. Both the missing\nsensitivity of the Polyakov loop to the quark mass, except at close to the\nchiral transition, and the Polyakov loop being zero at zero temperature at all\nchemical potentials, can be interpreted as indications of a missing mechanism\nwhich accounts for the quark back-reaction on the Polyakov loop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 18:18:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 May 2020 16:47:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

However, the readout\nreliability of resistive memories is impaired due to the inevitable existence\nof wire resistance, resulting in the sneak path problem. Motivated by this\nproblem, we study polar coding over channels with different reliability levels,\ntermed non-stationary polar codes, and we propose a technique improving its bit\nerror rate (BER) performance. We then apply the framework of non-stationary\npolar codes to the crossbar array and evaluate its BER performance under two\nmodeling approaches, namely binary symmetric channels (BSCs) and binary\nasymmetric channels (BSCs). Finally, we propose a technique for biasing the\nproportion of high-resistance states in the crossbar array and show its\nadvantage in reducing further the BER. Several simulations are carried out\nusing a SPICE-like simulator, exhibiting significant reduction in BER.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 18:19:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-22"}

A similar effect for dark photon propagating states is\nusually not considered due to the Landau-Yang theorem. We point out that mixing\nbetween photon and dark photon propagating states in background electromagnetic\nfields can indeed occur, in non-linear QED, through a four-photon vertex by\nintegrating out the electron box diagram. Starting from the Schwinger\nLagrangian, we derive the equations of motion for dark photons interacting with\nthe Standard Model photon through gauge kinetic terms. We provide expressions\nfor the perpendicular and parallel refractive indices in series expansions in\nthe critical field strength, valid both in the strong and weak background field\nlimits. We then consider mixing between the photon-dark photon propagating\nsystem in the presence of pure electric and magnetic background fields, and\nwork out the probability of conversion when the background fields are\nhomogeneous. We indicate outlines of the calculation in the inhomogeneous case,\nand finally express our results in the active-sterile basis, where we find that\nthe mixing induced by background fields can lead to corrections to the\ntree-level mixing in the zero field limit that is usually considered to probe\nsuch systems.

We identify no viable gravitational wave candidates\nconsistent with sub-solar mass ultracompact binaries with at least one\ncomponent between 0.2 - 1.0 solar masses. We use the null result to constrain\nthe binary merger rate of (0.2 solar mass, 0.2 solar mass) binaries to be less\nthan 3.7 x 10^5 Gpc^-3 yr^-1 and the binary merger rate of (1.0 solar mass, 1.0\nsolar mass) binaries to be less than 5.2 x 10^3 Gpc^-3 yr^-1. Sub-solar mass\nultracompact objects are not expected to form via known stellar evolution\nchannels, though it has been suggested that primordial density fluctuations or\nparticle dark matter with cooling mechanisms and/or nuclear interactions could\nform black holes with sub-solar masses. Assuming a particular primordial black\nhole formation model, we constrain a population of merging 0.2 solar mass black\nholes to account for less than 16% of the dark matter density and a population\nof merging 1.0 solar mass black holes to account for less than 2% of the dark\nmatter density. We discuss how constraints on the merger rate and dark matter\nfraction may be extended to arbitrary black hole population models that predict\nsub-solar mass binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 19:22:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 16:08:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 25 May 2019 13:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Traditional safety-margin-based deterministic\ndesign resorts to testing (e.g. prototype experiment, evaluation of\nhigh-fidelity simulation, etc.) to reduce epistemic uncertainty and achieve\ntargeted levels of safety. Testing is used to calibrate models and prescribe\nredesign when tests are not passed. After calibration, reduced epistemic model\nuncertainty can be leveraged through redesign to restore safety or improve\ndesign performance; however, redesign may be associated with substantial costs\nor delays. In this paper, a methodology is described for optimizing the\nsafety-margin-based design, testing, and redesign process to allow the designer\nto tradeoff between the risk of future redesign and the possible performance\nand reliability benefits. The proposed methodology represents the epistemic\nmodel uncertainty with a Kriging surrogate and is applicable in a wide range of\ndesign problems. The method is illustrated on a cantilever beam bending example\nand then a sounding rocket example. It is shown that redesign acts as a type of\nquality control measure to prevent an undesirable initial design from being\naccepted as the final design. It is found that the optimal design/redesign\nstrategy for maximizing expected design performance includes not only redesign\nto correct an initial design that is later revealed to be unsafe, but also\nredesign to improve performance when an initial design is later revealed to be\ntoo conservative (e.g. too heavy).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 19:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-22"}

To that end, the Large Underground Xenon (LUX)\nexperiment was built to directly observe the interaction of DM with xenon\ntarget nuclei. LUX acquired data from April 2013 to May 2016 at SURF in South\nDakota, which led to publications of many world-leading exclusion limits that\nprobe much of the unexplored DM parameter space. This manuscript describes two\nnovel direct detection methods that used the first LUX dataset to place limits\non sub-GeV DM. The Bremsstrahlung and Migdal effects consider electron recoils\nthat accompany the standard DM-nucleus scattering, thereby extending the reach\nof the LUX detector to lower DM masses. The spin-independent DM-nucleon\nscattering was constrained for four different classes of mediators for DM\nparticles with masses of 0.4-5 GeV/c$^{2}$. The detector conditions changed\nsignificantly before its final 332 live-days of data acquisition. The electric\nfields varied in a non-trivial non-symmetric manner, which triggered a need for\na fully 3D model of the electric fields inside the LUX detector. The successful\nmodeling of these electric fields, described herein, enabled a thorough\nunderstanding of the detector throughout its scientific program and\nstrengthened its sensitivity to DM. The LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment is a\nnext-generation xenon detector soon to start searching for DM. However,\nincreasingly large noble liquid detectors like LZ are facing challenges with\napplications of high voltage (HV). The Xenon Breakdown Apparatus (XeBrA) at the\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory was built to characterize the HV behavior\nof liquid xenon and liquid argon.

Coronal rain appears frequently in active region\ncoronal loops and is very common in post-flare loops. This Letter presents\ndiscovery observations, which show that coronal rain is ubiquitous in the\nembedded bipole very near a coronal hole boundary. Our observed structures\nformed when the photospheric decay of active region leading sunspots resulted\nin a large parasitic polarity embedded in a background unipolar region. We\nobserve coronal rain to appear within the legs of closed loops well under the\nfan surface, as well as preferentially near separatrices of the resulting\ncoronal topology: the spine lines, null point, and fan surface. We analyze 3\nevents using SDO Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) observations in the 304,\n171, and 211 {/AA} channels, as well as SDO Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager\n(HMI) magnetograms. The frequency of rain formation and the ease with which it\nis observed strongly suggests that this phenomenon is generally present in\nnull-point topologies of this size scale. We argue that these rain events could\nbe explained by the classic process of thermal nonequilibrium or via\ninterchange reconnection at the null; it is also possible that both mechanisms\nare present.

The focus of the present work is to embed physical\nconstraints into the structure of the neural network to address the second\nfundamental challenge.

Finally, a new unsupervised neural network is proposed that\nguarantees energy conservation through an embedded symplectic structure.

Before\nsolving the tasks, the learner enters an unsupervised playing stage where it\ncreates its own tasks to solve, tries to solve them, and saves any solutions\n(programs) to the background knowledge. After the playing stage is finished,\nthe learner enters the supervised building stage where it tries to solve the\nuser-supplied tasks and can reuse solutions learnt whilst playing. The idea is\nthat playing allows the learner to discover reusable general programs on its\nown which can then help solve the user-supplied tasks. We claim that playing\ncan improve learning performance. We show that playing can reduce the textual\ncomplexity of target concepts which in turn reduces the sample complexity of a\nlearner.

Here, based on the mechanism of Stoner-type magnetic instability,\nwe propose that in certain electrides the low-dimensionality can facilitate the\nformation of magnetic ground state because of the enhanced density of states\nnear the Fermi level.

Recent work has demonstrated the promise of\ndeep-learning approaches for LiDAR-based detection. However, deep-learning\nalgorithms are extremely data hungry, requiring large amounts of labeled\npoint-cloud data for training and evaluation. Annotating LiDAR point cloud data\nis challenging due to the following issues: 1) A LiDAR point cloud is usually\nsparse and has low resolution, making it difficult for human annotators to\nrecognize objects. 2) Compared to annotation on 2D images, the operation of\ndrawing 3D bounding boxes or even point-wise labels on LiDAR point clouds is\nmore complex and time-consuming. 3) LiDAR data are usually collected in\nsequences, so consecutive frames are highly correlated, leading to repeated\nannotations. To tackle these challenges, we propose LATTE, an open-sourced\nannotation tool for LiDAR point clouds. LATTE features the following\ninnovations: 1) Sensor fusion: We utilize image-based detection algorithms to\nautomatically pre-label a calibrated image, and transfer the labels to the\npoint cloud. 2) One-click annotation: Instead of drawing 3D bounding boxes or\npoint-wise labels, we simplify the annotation to just one click on the target\nobject, and automatically generate the bounding box for the target. 3)\nTracking: we integrate tracking into sequence annotation such that we can\ntransfer labels from one frame to subsequent ones and therefore significantly\nreduce repeated labeling. Experiments show the proposed features accelerate the\nannotation speed by 6.2x and significantly improve label quality with 23.6% and\n2.2% higher instance-level precision and recall, and 2.0% higher bounding box\nIoU.

An important problem with implementing a\nneural network is the design of its architecture. Typically, such an\narchitecture is obtained manually by exploring its hyperparameter space and\nkept fixed during training. This approach is time-consuming and inefficient.\nAnother issue is that modern neural networks often contain millions of\nparameters, whereas many applications and devices require small inference\nmodels. However, efforts to migrate DNNs to such devices typically entail a\nsignificant loss of classification accuracy. To address these challenges, we\npropose a two-step neural network synthesis methodology, called DR+SCANN, that\ncombines two complementary approaches to design compact and accurate DNNs. At\nthe core of our framework is the SCANN methodology that uses three basic\narchitecture-changing operations, namely connection growth, neuron growth, and\nconnection pruning, to synthesize feed-forward architectures with arbitrary\nstructure. SCANN encapsulates three synthesis methodologies that apply a\nrepeated grow-and-prune paradigm to three architectural starting points.\nDR+SCANN combines the SCANN methodology with dataset dimensionality reduction\nto alleviate the curse of dimensionality. We demonstrate the efficacy of SCANN\nand DR+SCANN on various image and non-image datasets. We evaluate SCANN on\nMNIST and ImageNet benchmarks. In addition, we also evaluate the efficacy of\nusing dimensionality reduction alongside SCANN (DR+SCANN) on nine small to\nmedium-size datasets.

The proposed method is based\non recent progress in non-linear independent component analysis and exploits\nthe non-stationarity of observations in order to recover the underlying sources\nor latent disturbances. We show rigorously that in the case of bivariate causal\ndiscovery, such non-linear ICA can be used to infer the causal direction via a\nseries of independence tests. We further propose an alternative measure of\ncausal direction based on asymptotic approximations to the likelihood ratio, as\nwell as an extension to multivariate causal discovery.

We present a new approach for identifying distracted\ndriving behavior by evaluating a stimulus and response interaction with the\nbrain signals in two ways. First, measuring the driver response through EEG by\ncreating various types of distraction stimuli such as reading, texting, calling\nand using phone camera (risk odds ratio of these activities determined by NHTSA\nstudy). Second, using a survey, comparing driver's order/perception of severity\nof distraction with the derived distraction index from EEG bands. A 14\nelectrodes headset was used to record the brain signals while driving in the\npilot study with two subjects and a single dry electrode headset with 13\nsubjects in the main study.

It involves the\naxial-axial-axial contribution to the chiral anomaly which couples the chiral\ncharge density to the elastic axial gauge field. The chiral sound is\nunidirectional: it propagates along the elastic magnetic field and not in the\nopposite direction.

It has been shown that multivariate data injection\nattacks can bypass bad data detection schemes typically built on static\nbehavior of the systems, which misleads operators to disruptive decisions. In\nthis article, we depart from the existing static viewpoint to develop a\ndiagnosis filter that captures the dynamics signatures of such a multivariate\nintrusion. To this end, we introduce a dynamic residual generator approach\nformulated as robust optimization programs in order to detect a class of\ndisruptive multivariate attacks that potentially remain stealthy in view of a\nstatic bad data detector. We investigate two possible desired features: (i) a\nnon-zero transient and (ii) a non-zero steady-state behavior of the residual\ngenerator in the presence of an attack. In case (i), the problem is\nreformulated as a finite, but possibly non-convex, optimization program. We\nfurther develop a linear programming relaxation that improves the scalability,\nand as such practicality, of the diagnosis filter design. In case (ii), it\nturns out that the resulting robust program admits an exact convex\nreformulation, yielding a Nash equilibrium between the attacker and the\nresidual generator. This assertion has an interesting implication: the proposed\napproach is not conservative in the sense that the additional knowledge of the\nworst-case attack does not improve the diagnosis performance. To illustrate our\ntheoretical results, we implement the proposed diagnosis filter to detect\nmultivariate attacks on the system measurements deployed to generate the\nso-called Automatic Generation Control signals in a three-area IEEE 39-bus\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 10:14:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Sep 2019 14:43:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

In this work,\ninspired by curriculum learning we consider the knowledge distillation from the\nperspective of curriculum learning by routing. Instead of supervising the\nstudent model with a converged teacher model, we supervised it with some anchor\npoints selected from the route in parameter space that the teacher model passed\nby, as we called route constrained optimization (RCO). We experimentally\ndemonstrate this simple operation greatly reduces the lower bound of congruence\nloss for knowledge distillation, hint and mimicking learning.

Firstly, one of the biggest\nchallenges is obtaining sufficient amounts of high quality training data. We\naddress the problem by using online handwriting data collected for a large\nscale production online handwriting recognition system. We describe our image\ndata generation pipeline and study how online data can be used to build HTR\nmodels. We show that the data improve the models significantly under the\ncondition where only a small number of real images is available, which is\nusually the case for HTR models. It enables us to support a new script at\nsubstantially lower cost. Secondly, we propose a line recognition model based\non neural networks without recurrent connections. The model achieves a\ncomparable accuracy with LSTM-based models while allowing for better\nparallelism in training and inference.

Comets with an active fraction above 0.5 typically have\nD/H ratios in water consistent with the terrestrial value.

As main technical result it is\nproved that any such composition can be realized as a linear bounded\ncomposition, which means that the sizes of the intermediate results can be\nchosen to be at most linear in the size of the output tree. This has\nconsequences for the expressiveness and complexity of the translations in the\nhierarchy. First, if the computed translation is a function of linear size\nincrease, i.e., the size of the output tree is at most linear in the size of\nthe input tree, then it can be realized by just one, deterministic,\ntree-walking tree transducer. For compositions of deterministic transducers it\nis decidable whether or not the translation is of linear size increase. Second,\nevery composition of deterministic transducers can be computed in deterministic\nlinear time on a RAM and in deterministic linear space on a Turing machine,\nmeasured in the sum of the sizes of the input and output tree.

Some algorithms do allow for some scaling of large computations by\nleveraging data parallelism. However, they often require a large amount of data\nto be exchanged in order to ensure the shared knowledge throughout the compute\nnodes is accurate.\n  In this work, the effect of different levels of communications between deep\nlearning models is studied, in particular how it affects performance. The first\napproach studied looks at decentralizing the numerous computations that are\ndone in parallel in training procedures such as synchronous and asynchronous\nstochastic gradient descent. In this setting, a simplified communication that\nconsists of exchanging low bandwidth outputs between compute nodes can be\nbeneficial.

Indeed, this is studied in a\nsimplified setup where a pre-trained model, analogous to a teacher, can\ncustomize a randomly initialized model's training procedure to accelerate\nlearning.

The collision of strong stellar winds in massive binary systems\ncreates powerful shocks, which have been expected to produce high-energy\ncosmic-rays through Fermi acceleration at the shock interface. The accelerated\nparticles should collide with stellar photons or ambient material, producing\nnon-thermal emission observable in X-rays and gamma-rays. The supermassive\nbinary star eta Carinae drives the strongest colliding wind shock in the solar\nneighborhood. Observations with non-focusing high-energy observatories indicate\na high energy source near eta Carinae, but have been unable to conclusively\nidentify eta Carinae as the source because of their relatively poor angular\nresolution. Here we present the first direct focussing observations of the\nnon-thermal source in the extremely hard X-ray band, which is found to be\nspatially coincident with the star within several arc-seconds. These\nobservations show that the source of non-thermal X-rays varies with the orbital\nphase of the binary, and that the photon index of the emission is similar to\nthat derived through analysis of the gamma-ray spectrum.

Derived from the drift reduced Braginskii\nequations, the new GRILLIX model includes electromagnetic and electron-thermal\ndynamics, retains global parametric dependencies and the Boussinesq\napproximation is not applied.

At the same time via direct comparison,\nwe find that the Boussinesq approximation has only a small quantitative impact\nin a turbulent environment. In comparison to circular geometry the fluctuations\nare reduced in diverted geometry, which is related to a different zonal flow\nstructure. Moreover, the fluctuation level has a more complex spatial\ndistribution in diverted geometry. Due to local magnetic shear, which differs\nfundamentally in circular and diverted geometry, turbulent structures become\nstrongly distorted in the perpendicular direction and are eventually damped\naway towards the X-point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 15:27:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

Here, we explore the Davydov model for quantum transport of amide I\nenergy, which is self-trapped in soliton states that propagate along the\nprotein {\\alpha}-helix spines and preserve their shape upon reflection from the\n{\\alpha}-helix ends. We study computationally whether the Davydov solitons are\nable to reflect from massive barriers that model the presence of external\nprotein clamps acting on a portion of the {\\alpha}-helix, and characterize the\nrange of barrier conditions for which the Davydov solitons are capable of\ntunneling through the barrier. The simulations showed that the variability of\namino acid masses in proteins has a negligible effect on Davydov soliton\ndynamics, but a massive barrier that is a hundred times the mass of a single\namino acid presents an obstacle for the soliton propagation. The greater width\nof Davydov solitons stabilizes the soliton upon reflection from such a massive\nbarrier and increases the probability of tunneling through it, whereas the\ngreater isotropy of the exciton-lattice coupling suppresses the tunneling\nefficiency by increasing the interaction time between the Davydov soliton and\nthe barrier, thereby prolonging the tunneling time through the barrier and\nenhancing the probability for reflection from the latter. The results as\npresented, demonstrate the feasibility of Davydov solitons reflecting from or\ntunneling through massive barriers, and suggest a general physical mechanism\nunderlying the action of protein clamps through local enhancement of an\neffective protein {\\alpha}-helix mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 10:08:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-23"}

Afterwards we motivate finite temperature\nfield theory, also known as thermal field theory, and study the thermodynamic\nbehavior of both a local and a nonlocal scalar field theory. We compute\n(primarily leading-order) thermal corrections to the partition function for in\nlow- and high- temperature expansions and calculate the thermal mass which is\nacquired through continuous interactions with the heat bath. We prove that the\nnonlocality does not contribute to the partition function of the free nonlocal\ntheory. The presence of the nonlocality can only be noticed through\ninteractions and we conclude that the partition function of the local and the\nnonlocal scalar theory are fundamentally different when interactions are\nincluded. We explain from both a mathematical and physical point of view why\nthe nonlocality can only be noticed at the level of interactions and conclude\nthat this cannot be generalized to arbitrary nonlocal modifications -- only\nthose which do not introduce new poles in the propagator. We study whether our\nresults can be reconciled with the stringy thermal duality and the conjectured\nHagedorn phase and conclude that the former is violated, while Hagedorn\nbehavior emerges in the high temperature expansion of the nonlocal scalar\ntheory. We will interpret all these results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 10:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

In\nrecent times, using the real time video one wants to narrate the scene captured\nby the camera fitted in our vehicle. To effectively implement this task, deep\nlearning techniques and automatic video annotation tools are widely used. In\nthe present paper, we compare the various techniques that are available for\neach module and choose the best algorithm among them by using appropriate\nmetrics. For object detection, YOLO and Retinanet-50 are considered and the\nbest one is chosen based on mean Average Precision (mAP). For object\nclassification, we consider VGG-19 and Resnet-50 and select the best algorithm\nbased on low error rate and good accuracy. For lane detection, Udacity's\n'Finding Lane Line' and deep learning based LaneNet algorithms are compared and\nthe best one that can accurately identify the given lane is chosen for\nimplementation. As far as object tracking is concerned, we compare Udacity's\n'Object Detection and Tracking' algorithm and deep learning based Deep Sort\nalgorithm. Based on the accuracy of tracking the same object in many frames and\npredicting the movement of objects, the best algorithm is chosen. Our automatic\nvideo annotation tool is found to be 83% accurate when compared with a human\nannotator. We considered a video with 530 frames each of resolution 1035 x 1800\npixels. At an average each frame had about 15 objects. Our annotation tool\nconsumed 43 minutes in a CPU based system and 2.58 minutes in a mid-level GPU\nbased system to process all four modules. But the same video took nearly 3060\nminutes for one human annotator to narrate the scene in the given video. Thus\nwe claim that our proposed automatic video annotation tool is reasonably fast\n(about 1200 times in a GPU system) and accurate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 10:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

I argue that this\nprinciple is neither an aesthetic nor a sociologically-influenced principle. I\ncontend that naturalness may only be plausibly argued to be an\naesthetic/sociological principle when formal measures of naturalness and their\nuse in physics communities are conflated with the central dogma of naturalness\n- the former may indeed be argued to be sociologically-influenced and somewhat\narbitrary - but these formal measures of naturalness are in fact less\nsuccessful than AoS naturalness. I put forward arguments as to why AoS\nnaturalness is well-defined and why it was reasonable for physicists to endorse\nthis naturalness principle on both theoretical and empirical grounds.\n  Up to date, no compelling reasons have appeared as to why the laws of nature\nshould generically decoupling into quasi-autonomous physical domains. A\ndecoupling of scales in the quantum realm is often claimed to be entailed by\nthe Decoupling Theorem (Cao and Schweber (1993)), yet I will show that this\ntheorem is too weak to underwrite quasi-autonomous physical domains in quantum\nfield theories because one should additionally impose that parameters be\nnatural. Violations of naturalness would then have ontological import -\nunnatural parameters would not be accurately described by EFTs but rather by\nfield theories exhibiting some kind of UV/IR interplay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 11:04:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}
