To\nrealize the data extraction directly from the encrypted domain without the\nprivate key, a key-switching based least-significant-bit (KS-LSB) data hiding\nmethod has been designed. In application, the user first encrypts the plaintext\nand uploads ciphertext to the server. Then the server performs data hiding by\nFHEE-DE and KS-LSB to obtain the marked ciphertext. Additional data can be\nextracted directly from the marked ciphertext by the server without the private\nkey. The user can decrypt the marked ciphertext to obtain the marked plaintext.\nThen additional data or plaintext can be obtained from the marked plaintext by\nusing the standard DE extraction or recovery. A fidelity constraint of DE is\nintroduced to reduce the distortion of the marked plaintext. FHEE-DE enables\nthe server to implement FHEE-DE recovery or extraction on the marked\nciphertext, which returns the ciphertext of original plaintext or additional\ndata to the user.

We find that both the relation type and the relation value are crucial\nin inferring user preference. To this end, we develop a two-level hierarchical\nattention mechanism to model user preference. The first-level attention\ndiscriminates which types of relations are more important, and the second-level\nattention considers the specific relation values to estimate the contribution\nof a historical item in recommending the target item. To make the item\nembeddings be reflective of the relational structure between items, we further\nformulate a task to preserve the item relations, and jointly train it with the\nrecommendation task of preference modeling.

In our case, the time\ndependence arises from the oscillation of a scalar field with a non-zero mass.\nWe systematically explore the scalar profile around the black hole for\ndifferent scalar masses. In the small mass limit, the scalar field has a $1/r$\ncomponent at large radius $r$, consistent with Jacobson's result.

Our\nstarting point is a recently derived fractional Fokker-Planck equation, which\ncovers both the case of Brownian diffusion and the case of a subdiffusive\nContinuous-Time Random Walk (CTRW). We find a high sensitivity of the random\nwalk properties to the details of the domain growth rate, which gives rise to a\nvariety of regimes with extremely different behaviors. At the origin of this\nrich phenomenology is the fact that the walkers still move while they wait to\njump, since they are dragged by the deterministic drift arising from the domain\ngrowth. Thus, the increasingly long waiting times associated with the ageing of\nthe subdiffusive CTRW imply that, in the time interval between two consecutive\njumps, the walkers might travel over much longer distances than in the normal\ndiffusive case. This gives rise to seemingly counterintuitive effects. For\nexample, on a static domain, both Brownian diffusion and subdiffusive CTRWs\nyield a stationary particle distribution with finite width when a harmonic\npotential is at play, thus indicating a confinement of the diffusing particle.\nHowever, for a sufficiently fast growing/contracting domain, this qualitative\nbehavior breaks down, and differences between the Brownian case and the\nsubdiffusive case are found. In the case of Brownian particles, a sufficiently\nfast exponential domain growth is needed to break the confinement induced by\nthe harmonic force; in contrast, for subdiffusive particles such a breakdown\nmay already take place for a sufficiently fast power-law domain growth. Our\nanalytic and numerical results for both types of diffusion are fully confirmed\nby random walk simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 16:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

The RCWA is\nwidely used to solve electromagnetic boundary-value problems where the relative\npermittivity varies periodically in one direction, i.e., scattering by a\ngrating. This semi-analytical approach expands all the electromagnetic field\nphasors as well as the relative permittivity as Fourier series in the spatial\nvariable along the direction of periodicity, and also replaces the relative\npermittivity with a stairstep approximation along the direction normal to the\ndirection of periodicity. Thus, there is error due to Fourier truncation and\nalso due to the approximation of grating permittivity. We prove that the RCWA\nis a Galerkin scheme, which allows us to employ techniques borrowed from the\nFinite Element Method to analyze the error. An essential tool is a Rellich\nidentity that shows that certain continuous problems have unique solutions that\ndepend continuously on the data with a continuity constant having explicit\ndependence on the relative permittivity. We prove that the RCWA converges with\nan increasing number of retained Fourier modes and with a finer approximation\nof the grating interfaces. Numerical results show that our convergence results\nfor increasing the number of retained Fourier modes are seen in practice, while\nour estimates of convergence in slice thickness are pessimistic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 17:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

Motivated by this\nobservation, this work provides a detailed study of the following question:\nwhat rate is achievable using the final iterate of SGD for the streaming least\nsquares regression problem with and without strong convexity?\n  First, this work shows that even if the time horizon T (i.e. the number of\niterations SGD is run for) is known in advance, SGD's final iterate behavior\nwith any polynomially decaying learning rate scheme is highly sub-optimal\ncompared to the minimax rate (by a condition number factor in the strongly\nconvex case and a factor of $\\sqrt{T}$ in the non-strongly convex case). In\ncontrast, this paper shows that Step Decay schedules, which cut the learning\nrate by a constant factor every constant number of epochs (i.e., the learning\nrate decays geometrically) offers significant improvements over any\npolynomially decaying step sizes. In particular, the final iterate behavior\nwith a step decay schedule is off the minimax rate by only $log$ factors (in\nthe condition number for strongly convex case, and in T for the non-strongly\nconvex case). Finally, in stark contrast to the known horizon case, this paper\nshows that the anytime (i.e. the limiting) behavior of SGD's final iterate is\npoor (in that it queries iterates with highly sub-optimal function value\ninfinitely often, i.e. in a limsup sense) irrespective of the stepsizes\nemployed. These results demonstrate the subtlety in establishing optimal\nlearning rate schemes (for the final iterate) for stochastic gradient\nprocedures in fixed time horizon settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 17:41:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 04:04:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

Due to the effects coming from the secondary\nproduction of massive quark-antiquark pairs there are two options to define the\nSCET jet function, which we call universal and mass mode jet functions. They\nare related to whether or not a soft mass mode (zero) bin subtraction is\napplied for the secondary massive quark contributions and differ in particular\nconcerning the infrared behavior for vanishing quark mass. We advocate that a\nuseful alternative to the common zero-bin subtraction concept is to define the\nSCET jet functions through subtractions related to collinear-soft matrix\nelements. This avoids the need to impose additional power counting arguments as\nrequired for zero-bin subtractions.

We investigate the mass,\nlong-term tidal-stability, composition and origin of material in both the discs\nand the exomoons. Our giant-impact models often generate relatively iron-rich\nmoons, that form beyond the synchronous radius of the planet, and would thus\ntidally evolve outward with stable orbits, rather than be destroyed. Our\nresults suggest that it is extremely difficult to collisionally form\ncurrently-detectable exomoons orbiting super-terrestrial planets, through\nsingle giant impacts. It might be possible to form massive, detectable exomoons\nthrough several mergers of smaller exomoons, formed by multiple impacts,\nhowever more studies are required in order to reach a conclusion. Given the\ncurrent observational initiatives, the search should focus primarily on more\nmassive planet categories. However, about a quarter of the exomoons predicted\nby our models are approximately Mercury-mass or more, and are much more likely\nto be detectable given a factor 2 improvement in the detection capability of\nfuture instruments, providing further motivation for their development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 17:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 09:37:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

To investigate the origin\nof its KDC, we coupled large data mosaics from the near-infrared (NIR)/optical\nintegral field unit (IFU) instruments K-band Multi-Object Spectrograph (KMOS)\nand Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). We studied IC 1459's stellar\npopulations and, for the first time for a KDC, the spatially resolved initial\nmass function (IMF). We used full-spectral-fitting to fit the stellar\npopulations and IMF simultaneously, and an alternative spectral-fitting method\nthat does not assume a star-formation history (SFH; although does not constrain\nthe IMF) for comparison. When no SFH is assumed, we derived a negative\nmetallicity gradient for IC 1459 that could be driven by a distinct metal-poor\npopulation in the outer regions of the galaxy, and a radially constant old\nstellar age. We found a radially constant bottom-heavy IMF out to $\\sim\n\\frac{1}{3} R_{\\rm e}$. The radially flat IMF and age extend beyond the\ncounter-rotating core. We detected high velocity dispersion along the galaxy's\nmajor axis. Our results potentially add weight to findings from orbital\nmodelling of other KDCs that the core is not a distinct population of stars but\nin fact two smooth co-spatial counter-rotating populations. No clear picture of\nformation explains the observational results of IC 1459, but we propose it\ncould have included a gas-rich intense period of star formation at early times,\nperhaps with counter-rotating accreting cold streams, followed by dry and\ngas-rich mergers through to the present day.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 18:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

One\npromising approach is to use minimal models that can relate mechanistic\nassumptions at the microbe scale to community-level patterns. Here, we\ndemonstrate the utility of this approach by showing that the Microbial Consumer\nResource Model (MiCRM) -- a minimal model for microbial communities with\nresource competition, metabolic crossfeeding and stochastic colonization -- can\nqualitatively reproduce patterns found in survey data including compositional\ngradients, dissimilarity/overlap correlations, richness/harshness correlations,\nand nestedness of community composition.

Here,\nthe focus is put on single and multirelaxation time collision models in either\ntheir raw moment, central moment, cumulant or regularized form.

In addition, a review of collision models further sheds light on\ncollision models that can be rewritten in a linear matrix form. More\nquantitative mathematical studies are then carried out by comparing explicit\nexpressions for the post collision populations. Thanks to this, it is possible\nto deduce the impact of both the polynomial basis (raw, Hermite, central,\ncentral Hermite, cumulant) and the inclusion of regularization steps on\nisothermal LBMs. Extensive results are provided for the D1Q3, D2Q9, and D3Q27\nlattices, the latter being further extended to the D3Q19 velocity\ndiscretization.

Human history\ncan be regarded as a sequence of long periods of cultural stasis punctuated by\nparadigm shifts that transform culture upside-down over the turn of a few\ngenerations. We propose here a population dynamics model devised to analyse\nparadigm shifts. In this model individuals are defined by a vector of cultural\ntraits that can change mainly through imitation of other individuals' traits.\nThe novelty of the model is that cultural traits may interact reinforcing or\nhindering each other. Imitation is then biased by the 'cultural fitness'\nlandscape thus defined. Our main result is that abrupt paradigm shifts occur,\nas a response to weak changes in the landscape, only when cultural traits do\ninteract---whereas adaptation is smooth if there is no interaction. Borrowing\nthe genetic term, this interaction is called 'cultural epistasis'. The result\nis robust to the way that epistasis is implemented, to whether imitation is\nbiased by homophily, or to changes in other model parameters. Finally, a\nrelevant consequence of this dynamics is the irreversible nature of paradigm\nshifts: the old paradigm cannot be restored even if the external changes are\nundone. Our model puts the phenomenon of paradigm shifts in cultural evolution\nin the same category as catastrophic shifts in ecology or phase transitions in\nphysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 22:06:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-04"}

The flexibility of geometric\nprogramming allows the state, input, and output matrices of the system to\nsimultaneously depend on the parameters to be tuned.

This study is performed in the context of the\nviscous fluid conduit system-the driven, cylindrical, free interface between\ntwo miscible Stokes fluids with high viscosity contrast. Due to buoyancy\ninduced nonlinear self-steepening balanced by stress induced interfacial\ndispersion, the disturbance evolves into a slowly modulated wavetrain and\nfurther, into a sequence of solitary waves. An extension of Whitham modulation\ntheory, termed the solitary wave resolution method, is used to resolve the\nfission of an initial disturbance into solitary waves. The developed theory\npredicts the relationship between the initial disturbance's profile, the number\nof emergent solitary waves, and their amplitude distribution, quantifying an\nextension of the well-known soliton resolution conjecture from integrable\nsystems to non-integrable systems that often provide a more accurate modelling\nof physical systems. The theoretical predictions for the fluid conduit system\nare confirmed both numerically and experimentally.

We present a paradigm for\nensemble modeling which mitigates the need to build complicated preprocessing\nand encoding schemes for categorical variables.

For each column of a categorical feature matrix we fit\na problem-specific prior distribution, for example, the Beta distribution for a\nbinary classification problem. In order to analytically derive the moments of\nthe posterior distribution, we update the prior with the conjugate likelihood\nof the corresponding target variable for each unique value of the given\ncategorical feature. This function of column and value encodes the categorical\nfeature matrix so that the final learner in the ensemble model ingests\nlow-dimensional numerical input.

Traditionally researchers have focused on functional magnetic\nresonance imaging (fMRI) data as the neural signals of interest for decoding\nvisual scenes. However, our visual perception operates in a fast time scale of\nmillisecond in terms of an event termed neural spike. There are few studies of\ndecoding by using spikes.

The SID is an end-to-end decoder with one end as neural spikes\nand the other end as images, which can be trained directly such that visual\nscenes are reconstructed from spikes in a highly accurate fashion. Our SID also\noutperforms on the reconstruction of visual stimulus compared to existing fMRI\ndecoding models. In addition, with the aid of a spike encoder, we show that SID\ncan be generalized to arbitrary visual scenes by using the image datasets of\nMNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Furthermore, with a pre-trained SID, one can\ndecode any dynamic videos to achieve real-time encoding and decoding of visual\nscenes by spikes.

However, for crater diameters $D \\lesssim 3-8$ km (which\ncorrespond to impactor diameters $d \\sim 0.04 - 0.15$ km), the observed\ndistributions become flatter and deviate from our results, which may evidence\nprocesses of erosion and/or crater saturation at small crater sizes or a\npossible break in the SFD of impactors at $d \\sim 0.04 - 0.15$ km to a much\nshallower differential slope of $\\sim -1.5$. Our results suggest that Pan,\nDaphnis, Atlas, Aegaeon, Methone, Anthe, Pallene, Calypso and Polydeuces\nsuffered one or more catastrophic collisions over the age of the Solar System,\nthe younger being associated to arcs with ages of $\\sim10^8$ years.

Recently, nonlinear spectral unmixing has received\nparticular attention because a linear mixture is not appropriate under many\nconditions. However, existing nonlinear unmixing approaches are often based on\nspecific assumptions regarding the inherent nonlinearity, and they can be\nineffective when applied to conditions deviating from the original assumptions.\nTherefore, these approaches are not well suited to scenes with unknown\nnonlinearity characteristics. This paper presents an unsupervised nonlinear\nspectral unmixing method based on a deep autoencoder network that applies to a\ngeneralized linear-mixture/nonlinear fluctuation model, consisting of a linear\nmixture component and an additive nonlinear mixture component that depends on\nboth endmembers and abundances. The proposed approach benefits from the\nuniversal modeling ability of deep neural networks to learn the inherent\nnonlinearity of the nonlinear mixture component from the data itself via the\nautoencoder network, rather than relying on an assumed form.

When one considers the modeling of unpredictably varying\nprocesses and complex dynamical signals with a large number of unknowns (such\nas those encountered in the fields of finance, NLP, communications, etc.),\nthere is a need for algorithms to have increased sensitivity with short spans\nof data, while maintaining stochastic generalization ability. This naturally\ncalls for an increased focus on localized stochastic representation. So far,\nmost metrics developed for characterizing signals envision data from entropic\nand probabilistic points of view that lack sensitivity towards quick changes in\nsignal dynamics. We hypothesize that models that work with the intrinsic\nuncertainties associated with local data induced metric spaces would be\nsignificantly more sensitive towards signal characterization. To this end, we\ndevelop a new framework for stochastic signal processing that is based on\ndecomposing the local metric space of the signal in a Gaussian Reproducing\nKernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). A major advantage of our framework is that we are\nable to implement this decomposition on a sample-by-sample basis. The key\naspects of our framework are the following: (1) We use a data defined metric\nrelated to Parzen density estimation for quantifying the local structure of\ndata in the Gaussian RKHS. (2) We use a quantum description of this metric\nwhich consequently introduces uncertainty in the structure of the local kernel\nspace. Since the RKHS has been well established and known for providing\nuniversal data fitting capabilities, we submit that local quantifiers of the\nkernel space data projection could significantly improve acquisition of signal\ninformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 03:34:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 May 2019 12:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}

This paper introduces a technique to transform\nan optimal control problem formulated in the muscle-actuation space to an\nequivalent problem in the joint-actuation space, such that the solutions to\nboth problems have the same optimal value. By solving the equivalent problem in\nthe joint-actuation space, we can generate human-like motions comparable to\nthose generated by musculotendon models, while retaining the benefit of simple\nmodeling and fast computation offered by joint-actuation models.

We\nassume rateless coding scheme is adopted at the transmitter and an update can\nbe successfully decoded if $k$ coded symbols are received successfully. We\nassume perfect feedback available at the source, so that it knows whether a\ntransmitted symbol has been erased instantly. Then, at the beginning of each\ntime slot, the source has the choice to start transmitting a new update, or\ncontinue with the transmission of the previous update if it is not delivered\nyet. We adopt the metric \"Age of Information\" (AoI) to measure the freshness of\ninformation at the destination, where the AoI is defined as the age of the\nlatest decoded update at the destination. Our objective is to design an optimal\nonline transmission scheme to minimize the time-average AoI. The transmission\ndecision is based on the instantaneous AoI, the age of the update being\ntransmitted, as well as the number of successfully delivered symbols of the\nupdate.

Traditionally, such invariants\nare manually enforced and checked by programmers. This ad-hoc practice is\ndifficult because the programmer must manually account for all the locations\nand configurations that break an invariant. Moreover, implicit invariants are\nbrittle under code-evolution: when the invariants and data structures change,\nthe programmer must repeat the process of manually repairing all of the code\nlocations where invariants are violated.\n  A much better approach is to introduce data invariants as a language feature\nand rely on language support to maintain invariants. To handle this challenge,\nwe introduce Targeted Synthesis, a technique for integrating data invariants\nwith invariant-agnostic imperative code at compile-time. This technique is\nnontrivial due to the complex structure of both invariant specifications, as\nwell as general imperative code.\n  The key insight is to take a language co-design approach involving both the\nlanguage of data invariants, as well as the imperative language. We leverage\nthis insight to produce two high-level results: first, we support a language\nwith iterators without requiring general quantified reasoning, and second, we\ninfer complicated invariant-preserving patches. We evaluate these claims\nthrough a language termed Spyder, a core calculus of data invariants over\nimperative iterator programs. We evaluate the expressiveness and performance of\nSpyder on a variety of programs inspired by web applications, and we find that\nSpyder efficiently compiles and maintains data invariants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 04:58:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 2019 18:27:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

Here, we propose a minimal model with\nonly two hidden units in a restricted Boltzmann machine, which aims to address\nhow the permutation symmetry affects the critical learning data size at which\nthe concept-formation (or spontaneous symmetry breaking in physics language)\nstarts, and moreover semi-rigorously prove a conjecture that the critical data\nsize is independent of the number of hidden units once this number is finite.\nRemarkably, we find that the embedded correlation between two receptive fields\nof hidden units reduces the critical data size. In particular, the\nweakly-correlated receptive fields have the benefit of significantly reducing\nthe minimal data size that triggers the transition, given less noisy data.\nInspired by the theory, we also propose an efficient fully-distributed\nalgorithm to infer the receptive fields of hidden units. Furthermore, our\nminimal model reveals that the permutation symmetry can also be spontaneously\nbroken following the spontaneous symmetry breaking. Overall, our results\ndemonstrate that the unsupervised learning is a progressive combination of\nspontaneous symmetry breaking and permutation symmetry breaking which are both\nspontaneous processes driven by data streams (observations). All these effects\ncan be analytically probed based on the minimal model, providing theoretical\ninsights towards understanding unsupervised learning in a more general context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 05:08:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 01:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}

By validating the resulting timeseries\nagainst observed generation it is assessed at which spatial levels the\ndifferent methods improve results - and whether global information derived from\nthe GWA can compete with locally measured wind speed data as a source of bias\ncorrection. Results show that (i) bias correction with the GWA improves results\non state, sub-system, and national-level, but not on wind park level, that (ii)\nthe GWA improves results comparably to local measurements, and that (iii)\ncomplex spatial interpolation methods do not contribute in improving quality of\nthe simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 07:32:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 09:29:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-26"}

As propagating light gets partially absorbed, the\nresulting thermal expansion generates minute ultrasonic signals (the\nphoto-acoustic effect) that are measured at the boundary of a domain of\ninterest. Standard inversion procedures first reconstruct the source of\nradiation by an inverse ultrasound (boundary) problem and second describe the\noptical parameters from internal information obtained in the first step.\n  This paper considers the rotating experimental setting. Light emission and\nultrasound measurements are fixed on a rotating gantry, resulting in a\nrotation-dependent source of ultrasound. The two-step procedure we just\nmentioned does not apply. Instead, we propose an inversion that directly aims\nto reconstruct the optical parameters quantitatively. The mapping from the\nunknown (absorption and diffusion) coefficients to the ultrasound measurement\nvia the unknown ultrasound source is modeled as a composition of a\npseudo-differential operator and a Fourier integral operator. We show that for\nappropriate choices of optical illuminations, the above composition is an\nelliptic Fourier integral operator. Under the assumption that the coefficients\nare unknown on a sufficiently small domain, we derive from this a (global)\ninjectivity result (measurements uniquely characterize our coefficients)\ncombined with an optimal stability estimate.

The model considers electrons and ions as\nseparate fluids, comprising the electron inertia and charge separation. The\ndiscretization of this system with standard explicit schemes is constrained by\nvery restrictive time steps and cell sizes related to the resolution of the\nDebye length, electron plasma frequency, and electron sound waves. Both sheath\nand electron inertia are fundamental to fully explain the physics in\nlow-pressure and low-temperature plasmas. However, most of the phenomena of\ninterest for fluid models occur at speeds much slower than the electron thermal\nspeed and are quasi-neutral, except in small charged regions. In this work, we\npresent a scheme based on the Lagrange-projection operator splitting that\npreserves the asymptotic regime where the plasma is quasi-neutral with massless\nelectrons. As a result, the quasi-neutral regime is treated without the need of\nan implicit solver nor the resolution of the Debye length and electron plasma\nfrequency. Additionally, the scheme proves to accurately represent the dynamics\nof the electrons both at low speeds and when the electron speed is comparable\nto the thermal speed. In addition, a well-balanced treatment of the ion source\nterms is proposed in order to tackle problems where the ion temperature is very\nlow compared to the electron temperature. The scheme significantly improves the\naccuracy both in the quasi-neutral limit and in the presence of plasma sheaths\nwhen the Debye length is resolved. The scheme is assessed in two specifically\ndesigned test-cases: a quasi-neutral two-stream periodic perturbation with\nanalytical solution and a low-temperature discharge that includes sheaths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 07:58:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

To apply graph\nneural networks for the graph classification task, approaches to generate the\n\\textit{graph representation} from node representations are demanded. A common\nway is to globally combine the node representations. However, rich structural\ninformation is overlooked. Thus a hierarchical pooling procedure is desired to\npreserve the graph structure during the graph representation learning.

The main cause for this\nis that loading matrix elements from RAM into CPU cache is significantly slower\nthan performing the arithmetic operations when solving the problem. In order to\nimprove the performance of iterative solvers within the high-performance\ncomputing context, so-called matrix-free methods are widely adopted in the\nfluid mechanics community, where matrix-vector products are computed\non-the-fly.\n  To date, there have been few (if any) assessments into the applicability of\nthe matrix-free approach to problems in solid mechanics. In this work, we\nperform an initial investigation on the application of the matrix-free approach\nto problems in quasi-static finite-strain hyperelasticity to determine whether\nit is viable for further extension. Specifically, we study different numerical\nimplementations of the finite element tangent operator, and determine whether\ngeneralized methods of incorporating complex constitutive behavior might be\nfeasible. In order to improve the convergence behavior of iterative solvers, we\nalso propose a method by which to construct level tangent operators and employ\nthem to define a geometric multigrid preconditioner. The performance of the\nmatrix-free operator and the geometric multigrid preconditioner is compared to\nthe matrix-based implementation with an algebraic multigrid preconditioner on a\nsingle node for a representative numerical example of a heterogeneous\nhyperelastic material in two and three dimensions.

Once an IoT device\nis localized its new position and the list of neighbor nodes are added to the\nBlockchain. This shared localization data will be used later by other IoT\ndevices for their localization process. To avoid the attack where a malicious\nnode sends a fake position, the correctness of the claimed position are\nverified before adding it to the Blockchain. Moreover, data exchanged between\nnodes (IoT devices) are signed to guarantee their authenticity and integrity.\nThe integration of these security mechanisms into the localization process\npermits to exclude false data and therefore reduces the localization error.

Disc and stellar masses are estimated from the\ncontinuum flux and position-velocity diagrams, and six of the sources show\ndisc-like structures. Towards the more luminous sources, compact emission and\nlarge line widths are seen for transitions of SO2 that probe warm gas (Eu ~200\nK). In contrast, C17O emission is detected towards the least evolved and less\nluminous systems. No emission of CH3OH is detected towards any of the continuum\npeaks, indicating an absence of warm CH3OH gas towards these sources. A\npower-law relation is seen between the stellar mass and the bolometric\nluminosity, corresponding to a mass accretion rate of (2.4 +/- 0.6) x 10^-7\nMsun/year for the Class I sources. This mass accretion rate is lower than the\nexpected value if the accretion is constant in time and rather points to a\nscenario of accretion occurring in bursts. The differentiation between C17O and\nSO2 suggests that they trace different physical components: C17O traces the\ndensest and colder regions of the disc-envelope system, while SO2 may be\nassociated with regions of higher temperature, such as accretion shocks. The\nlack of warm CH3OH emission suggests that there is no hot-core-like region\naround any of the sources and that the CH3OH column density averaged over the\ndisc is low.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 11:22:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

Estimating water flux in porous media using streaming potential\ndata relies on our capacity to understand, model, and upscale the\nelectrokinetic coupling at the mineral-solution interface. Different approaches\nhave been proposed to predict streaming potential generation in porous media.\nOne of these approaches is the flux averaging which is based on determining the\nexcess charge which is effectively dragged in the medium by water flow. In this\nstudy, we develop a physically-based analytical model to predict the effective\nexcess charge in saturated porous media using a flux-averaging approach in a\nbundle of capillary tubes with a fractal pore-size distribution. The proposed\nmodel allows the determination of the effective excess charge as a function of\npore water ionic concentration and hydrogeological parameters like porosity,\npermeability and tortuosity.

One of the main\nfindings of this study is the mechanistic explanation to the empirical\ndependence between the effective excess charge and the permeability that has\nbeen found by several researchers.

As a result, test data selection is\nperformed manually and in an ad hoc way. This raises the question of how we can\nautomatically select candidate test data to test deep learning models. Recent\nresearch has focused on adapting test selection metrics from code-based\nsoftware testing (such as coverage) to deep learning. However, deep learning\nmodels have different attributes from code such as spread of computations\nacross the entire network reflecting training data properties, balance of\nneuron weights and redundancy (use of many more neurons than needed). Such\ndifferences make code-based metrics inappropriate to select data that can\nchallenge the models (can trigger misclassification). We thus propose a set of\ntest selection metrics based on the notion of model uncertainty (model\nconfidence on specific inputs). Intuitively, the more uncertain we are about a\ncandidate sample, the more likely it is that this sample triggers a\nmisclassification. Similarly, the samples for which we are the most uncertain,\nare the most informative and should be used to improve the model by retraining.\nWe evaluate these metrics on two widely-used image classification problems\ninvolving real and artificial (adversarial) data. We show that\nuncertainty-based metrics have a strong ability to select data that are\nmisclassified and lead to major improvement in classification accuracy during\nretraining: up to 80% more gain than random selection and other\nstate-of-the-art metrics on one dataset and up to 29% on the other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 12:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

We propose\nHarmonic Coding, which universally computes any gradient-type function, while\nrequiring the minimum possible number of workers. Harmonic Coding strictly\nimproves computing schemes developed based on prior works, such as Shamir's\nsecret sharing and Lagrange Coded Computing, by injecting coded redundancy\nusing harmonic progression. It enables the computing results of the workers to\nbe interpreted as the sum of partial gradients and some redundant results,\nwhich then allows the cancellation of non-gradient terms in the decoding\nprocess. By proving a matching converse, we demonstrate the optimality of\nHarmonic Coding, even compared to the schemes that are non-universal (i.e., can\nbe designed based on a specific gradient-type function).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

Automatic emotion recognition (AER) using\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) signals is an effective method for decoding the real\nemotions, which are independent of body gestures, but it is a challenging\nproblem. Several automatic emotion recognition systems have been proposed,\nwhich are based on traditional hand-engineered approaches and their\nperformances are very poor. Motivated by the outstanding performance of deep\nlearning (DL) in many recognition tasks, we introduce an AER system (Deep-AER)\nbased on EEG brain signals using DL. A DL model involves a large number of\nlearnable parameters, and its training needs a large dataset of EEG signals,\nwhich is difficult to acquire for AER problem. To overcome this problem, we\nproposed a lightweight pyramidal one-dimensional convolutional neural network\n(LP-1D-CNN) model, which involves a small number of learnable parameters. Using\nLP-1D-CNN, we build a two level ensemble model. In the first level of the\nensemble, each channel is scanned incrementally by LP-1D-CNN to generate\npredictions, which are fused using majority vote. The second level of the\nensemble combines the predictions of all channels of an EEG signal using\nmajority vote for detecting the emotion state. We validated the effectiveness\nand robustness of Deep-AER using DEAP, a benchmark dataset for emotion\nrecognition research. The results indicate that FRONT plays dominant role in\nAER and over this region, Deep-AER achieved the accuracies of 98.43% and 97.65%\nfor two AER problems, i.e., high valence vs low valence (HV vs LV) and high\narousal vs low arousal (HA vs LA), respectively. The comparison reveals that\nDeep-AER outperforms the state-of-the-art systems with large margin. The\nDeep-AER system will be helpful in monitoring for health care and security\ninvestigations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:43:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

The non-rigid shape will be decomposed into\nthe mean shape and the degenerate shapes, constructed from the right singular\nvectors of the low-rank decomposition. The right singular vectors are affinely\nback-projected into the 3D space, and the affine back-projections will also be\nsolved as part of the factorisation. By construction, a direct interpretation\nfor the right singular vectors of the low-rank decomposition will also follow:\nthey can be seen as principal components, hence, the first variant of our\nmethod is referred to as Rank-1-PCA. The second variant, referred to as\nRank-1-ICA, additionally estimates the orthogonal transform which maps the\ndeformation modes into as statistically independent modes as possible.

Specifically, we show that the taxation problem is\nintimately connected to the heat equation. Our first result is a new property\nof the optimal tax which we call the fairness principle. The optimal tax at any\nincome is invariant under a family of properly adjusted Gaussian averages (the\nheat kernel) of the optimal taxes at other incomes. That is, the optimal tax at\na given income is equal to the weighted by the heat kernels average of optimal\ntaxes at other incomes and income densities. Moreover, this averaging happens\nat every scale tightly linked to each other providing a unified weighting\nscheme at all income ranges. The fairness principle arises not due to equality\nconsiderations but rather it represents an efficient way to smooth the burden\nof taxes and generated revenues across incomes. Just as nature wants to\ndistribute heat evenly, the optimal way for a government to raise revenues is\nto distribute the tax burden and raised revenues evenly among individuals. We\nthen construct a gradient flow of taxes -- a dynamic process changing the\nexisting tax system in the direction of the increase in tax revenues -- and\nshow that it takes the form of a heat equation. The fairness principle holds\nalso for the short-term asymptotics of the gradient flow, where the averaging\nis done over the current taxes. The gradient flow we consider can be viewed as\na continuous process of a reform of the nonlinear income tax schedule and thus\nunifies the variational approach to taxation and optimal taxation.

Besides deriving star-formation rates (SFRs) from SED\nfitting, we also utilize far-infrared (FIR) photometry and a stacking method to\nobtain FIR-based SFRs. We find that the SFRs of type 1 and type 2 sources are\nsimilar once their redshifts and X-ray luminosities are controlled. We also\ninvestigate cosmic environment, and find that the surface number densities\n(sub-Mpc) and cosmic-web environments ($\\approx 1\\text{--}10$~Mpc) are similar\nfor both populations. In summary, our analyses show that the host galaxies of\ntype 1 and type 2 AGNs have similar SFR and cosmic environment in general, but\nthe former tend to have lower $M_\\star$ than the latter. The difference in\n$M_\\star$ indicates that the AGN unification model is not strictly correct and\nboth host galaxy and torus may contribute to the optical obscuration of AGNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 14:50:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

Achieving this\nrepresentation can be done via learning, where both the world representation\nand the language grounding are learned simultaneously.

Then the\ngenerated images are employed to train the vehicle reID model by a proposed\nattention-based feature learning model with more reasonable styles. Through the\nproposed framework, the well-trained reID model has better domain adaptation\nability for various scenes in real-world situations.

Despite the weakness of gravity, in principle there\nis a chance, to observe such a quantum signature of the gravity by exploiting\nthe quantum optomechanical techniques, without direct observation of graviton.\nWe are investigating a new dynamical scheme called, gravitational quantum\nregime, in which the source of gravity is a quantum particle, and its centre of\nmass is subject to the spatial superposition. In a Gedankenexperiment, a test\nparticle is gravitationally interacting with a quantum nanoparticle in a\ndouble-slit setup. Possible entanglement or superposition of the fields is\ninvestigated. We are looking for the corresponding deviation of the classical\ndescription of gravity despite being far from the Planck scale. Any\nexperimental interrogation which reveals that gravitational field obeys the\nquantum superposition principle would be the first recognition of quantumness\nof gravity. This study will show how feasible it is to search for a\nnon-classical feature of gravity in such a regime of motion. Moreover, this\nproposal would be an attempt to test the objectivity of the quantum\nsuperposition principle and its contribution to the microstructure of\nspace-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 14:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-03"}

Even though extant\nresearch has successfully considered diverse families of objective functions\nand constraints, one of the most common limitations is the focus on the\nsingle-team paradigm. Despite its well-documented applications in multiple\ndomains, this paradigm is not appropriate when the team-builder needs to\npartition the entire population into multiple teams. Team-partitioning tasks\nare very common in an educational setting, in which the teacher has to\npartition the students in her class into teams for collaborative projects. The\ntask also emerges in the context of organizations, when managers need to\npartition the workforce into teams with specific properties to tackle relevant\nprojects. In this work, we extend the team formation literature by introducing\nthe Guided Team-Partitioning (GTP) problem, which asks for the partitioning of\na population into teams such that the centroid of each team is as close as\npossible to a given target vector. As we describe in detail in our work, this\nformulation allows the team-builder to control the composition of the produced\nteams and has natural applications in practical settings. Algorithms for the\nGTP need to simultaneously consider the composition of multiple non-overlapping\nteams that compete for the same population of candidates. This makes the\nproblem considerably more challenging than formulations that focus on the\noptimization of a single team. In fact, we prove that GTP is NP-hard to solve\nand even to approximate.

However, if AI is to improve\npeople's lives, then people must be able to trust AI, which means being able to\nunderstand what the system is doing and why. Even though transparency is often\nseen as the requirement in this case, realistically it might not always be\npossible or desirable, whereas the need to ensure that the system operates\nwithin set moral bounds remains. In this paper, we present an approach to\nevaluate the moral bounds of an AI system based on the monitoring of its inputs\nand outputs. We place a \"glass box\" around the system by mapping moral values\ninto explicit verifiable norms that constrain inputs and outputs, in such a way\nthat if these remain within the box we can guarantee that the system adheres to\nthe value. The focus on inputs and outputs allows for the verification and\ncomparison of vastly different intelligent systems; from deep neural networks\nto agent-based systems. The explicit transformation of abstract moral values\ninto concrete norms brings great benefits in terms of explainability;\nstakeholders know exactly how the system is interpreting and employing relevant\nabstract moral human values and calibrate their trust accordingly. Moreover, by\noperating at a higher level we can check the compliance of the system with\ndifferent interpretations of the same value. These advantages will have an\nimpact on the well-being of AI systems users at large, building their trust and\nproviding them with concrete knowledge on how systems adhere to moral values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2019 15:02:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 09:33:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

This converter is designed to simplify the\ncompatibility of electronic ballast with simple and low cost LED drivers. The\nconverter provides starting voltage and current limitation of electronic\nballasts, which operates at continuous conduction mode (CCM). The voltage of\nload terminal is controlled by adjusting the duty cycle of the PWM regulator.\nAlthough both converter switches are controlled separately, one feedback\ncontrol loop is needed to obtain the desired compensator level. Appropriate\ncontrol requirements have been defined by analyzing open-loop characteristic of\nconverter transfer function through the small-signal model of CBB, which lets\ndecide about the control strategy and analyse the stability and performance of\nthe closed loop control system. In order to obtain the desired output voltage,\nType-III rational controller is preferred because of the non-minimum phase\nfeature in the converter boost mode. The performance of the synthesized voltage\ncontroller is verified by comparing of the pre-determined performance\nrequirements and the obtained simulation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 21:48:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

We first give a short overview of\nrelativistic Hamiltonians that are frequently applied to account for\nrelativistic effects. Then, we scrutinize various quantum chemistry methods\nthat approximate the $N$-electron wave function. In this respect, we will\nreview the most popular single- and multi-reference approaches that have been\ndeveloped to model the multi-reference nature of heavy element compounds and\ntheir ground- and excited-state electronic structures. Specifically, we\nintroduce various flavors of post-Hartree--Fock methods and optimization\nschemes like the complete active space self-consistent field method, the\nconfiguration interaction approach, the Fock-space coupled cluster model, the\npair-coupled cluster doubles ansatz, also known as the antisymmetric product of\n1 reference orbital geminal, and the density matrix renormalization group\nalgorithm. Furthermore, we will illustrate how concepts of quantum information\ntheory provide us with a qualitative understanding of complex electronic\nstructures using the picture of interacting orbitals. While modern quantum\nchemistry facilitates a quantitative description of atoms and molecules as well\nas their properties, concepts of quantum information theory offer new\nstrategies for a qualitative interpretation that can shed new light onto the\nchemistry of complex molecular compounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 21:50:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 10:15:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}
