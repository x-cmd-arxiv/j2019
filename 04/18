The coupling between the\nmagnetic field and gas is determined by the ionization degree in the gas. Here,\nwe calculate the thermal and chemical evolution of the primordial gas by\nsolving chemical reaction network where all the reactions are reversed. We find\nthat at ~ 10^14-10^18 /cm^3, the ionization degree becomes 100-1000 times\nhigher than the previous results due to the lithium ionization by thermal\nphotons trapped in the cloud, which has been omitted so far. We construct the\nminimal chemical network which can reproduce correctly the ionization degree as\nwell as the thermal evolution by extracting 36 reactions among 13 species.\nUsing the obtained ionization degree, we evaluate the magnetic field\ndiffusivity. We find that the field dissipation can be neglected for global\nfields coherent over > a tenth of the cloud size as long as the field is not so\nstrong as to prohibit the collapse. With magnetic fields strong enough for\nambipolar diffusion heating to be significant, the magnetic pressure effects to\nslow down the collapse and to reduce the compressional heating become more\nimportant, and the temperature actually becomes lower than in the no-field\ncase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 16:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

Unlike for black holes, where the dissipation required\nfor superradiance is provided by an absorbative horizon, the non-hermitian\ndynamics in this paper come from the resistivity in the stellar magnetosphere\narising from a finite bulk conductivity. The axion field mixes with photon\nmodes which superradiantly scatter off the magnetosphere, extracting rotational\nenergy which is then deposited back into the axion sector leading to an\ninstability. We derive the superradiant eigenfrequencies for the axion-photon\nsystem using quantum mechanical perturbation theory on the axion boundstate,\ndrawing an analogy with atomic selection rules.

This is crucial since keeping food diaries helps identify areas\nwhere changes needed to help user's loss weight, based on the application\nfeedback. To achieve this, the provided data should be consistent among all\napplications. Otherwise, this will question the effectiveness and reliability\nof such tools in tracking diet and weight loss, and hence question user trust\nin these applications. This study characterizes the use of 4 food journaling\napplications to track user diet for 10 days (namely, MyFitnessPal, Lose It,\nFatSecret, CRONOMeter).

The obtaining of high-resolution digital images can be made at the\ntime of the shooting, but it is often synonymic of important costs because of\nthe necessary material to avoid such costs, it is known how to use methods of\nsuper-resolution reconstruction, consisting from one or several low resolution\nimages to obtain a high-resolution image. The american patent US 9208537\ndescribes such an algorithm. A zone of one low-resolution image is isolated and\ncategorized according to the information contained in pixels forming the\nborders of the zone. The category of it zone determines the type of\ninterpolation used to add pixels in aforementioned zone, to increase the\nneatness of the images. It is also known how to reconstruct a low-resolution\nimage there high-resolution image by using a model of super-resolution\nreconstruction whose learning is based on networks of neurons and on image or a\npicture library.

It is desirable to find near-optimal solutions with\nvery few function evaluations. Surrogate-assisted optimizers tend to reduce the\nrequired number of function evaluations by replacing the real function with an\nefficient mathematical model built on few evaluated points. Problems with a\nhigh condition number are a challenge for many surrogate-assisted optimizers\nincluding SACOBRA. To address such problems we propose a new online whitening\noperating in the black-box optimization paradigm. We show on a set of\nhigh-conditioning functions that online whitening tackles SACOBRA's early\nstagnation issue and reduces the optimization error by a factor between 10 to\n1e12 as compared to the plain SACOBRA, though it imposes many extra function\nevaluations. Covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) has for\nvery high numbers of function evaluations even lower errors, whereas SACOBRA\nperforms better in the expensive setting (less than 1e03 function evaluations).\nIf we count all parallelizable function evaluations (population evaluation in\nCMA-ES, online whitening in our approach) as one iteration, then both\nalgorithms have comparable strength even on the long run.

We show that boson-affected\nhopping models can provide a natural realization of fractons, either\napproximately or exactly, depending on the details of the system. We first\nconsider a generic one-dimensional boson-affected hopping model, in which we\nshow that single particles move only at sixth order in perturbation theory,\nwhile motion of bound states occurs at second order, allowing for a broad\nparameter regime exhibiting approximate fracton phenomenology. We explicitly\nmap the model onto a fracton Hamiltonian featuring conservation of dipole\nmoment via integrating out the mediating bosons. We then consider a special\ntype of boson-affected hopping models with mutual hard-core repulsion between\nparticles and bosons, accessible in hole-doped mixed-dimensional Ising\nantiferromagnets, in which the hole motion is one dimensional in an otherwise\ntwo-dimensional antiferromagnetic background. We show that this system, which\nis within the current reach of ultracold-atom experiments, exhibits perfect\nfracton behavior to all orders in perturbation theory, thereby enabling the\nexperimental study of dipole-conserving field theories. We further discuss\ndiagnostic signatures of fractonic behavior in these systems.

The preferred dark-halo mass of\n~$10^{12}M_\\odot$ is translated to a characteristic epoch, z~2, at which the\ntypical forming halos have a comparable mass. We put together a coherent\npicture based on existing and new simple analytic modeling and cosmological\nsimulations. We describe how the golden mass arises from two physical\nmechanisms that suppress gas supply and star formation below and above the\ngolden mass, supernova feedback and virial shock heating of the circum-galactic\nmedium (CGM), respectively. Cosmological simulations reveal that these\nmechanisms are responsible for a similar favored mass for the dramatic events\nof gaseous compaction into compact star-forming \"blue nuggets\", caused by\nmergers, counter-rotating streams or other mechanisms. This triggers inside-out\nquenching of star formation, to be maintained by the hot CGM, leading to\ntoday's passive early-type galaxies. The blue-nugget phase is responsible for\ntransitions in the galaxy structural, kinematic and compositional properties,\ne.g., from dark-matter to baryon central dominance and from prolate to oblate\nshape. The growth of the central black hole is suppressed by supernova feedback\nbelow the critical mass, and is free to grow once the halo is massive enough to\nlock the supernova ejecta by its deep potential well and the hot CGM. A\ncompaction near the golden mass makes the black hole sink to the galactic\ncenter and triggers a rapid black-hole growth. This ignites feedback by the\nActive Galactic Nucleus that helps keeping the CGM hot and maintaining\nlong-term quenching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-19"}

The model validation is carried out for the momentum\ntransport by comparing ODT results to available reference data for the bulk\nReynolds numbers $Re=20\\,000$ and $40\\,000$. Various pointwise statistical\nquantities are computed and compared to the available reference data. We show\nthat these quantities can be captured well, or at least to a reasonable extent,\nby the stand-alone model formulation and for fixed model parameters. Only the\nroot-mean-square velocity fluctuations remain systematically underestimated in\nthe ODT results (by an approximate factor of $1.5$). Afterwards, the turbulent\ntransport of a passive scalar is addressed for the Schmidt numbers $Sc=1$ and\n$1250$. For the high Schmidt number and in contrast to the velocity\nfluctuations, it is shown that the scalar fluctuation variance is up to ten\ntimes larger in the ODT simulations resolving the Batchelor scale. The\nfluctuation variance is notably smaller for the lower Schmidt number, but\nexhibits better agreement with the references at a nominally higher Schmidt\nnumber. We suggest that this is due to implicit filtering in the references,\nwhich barely resolve the Kolmogorov scale. ODT turbulence spectra support this\ninterpretation since a Batchelor-like scalar turbulence spectrum is only\nobserved for the higher Schmidt number. With the aid of these spectra and the\nfluctuation statistics we conclude that implicit filtering has a similar effect\nas a reduction of the Schmidt number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 19:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-19"}

We study coherent structures in photospheric flows in a\nregion of quiet Sun consisted of supergranules. Supergranular turbulence is\ninvestigated by detecting hyperbolic and elliptic Lagrangian coherent\nstructures (LCS) using the horizontal velocity fields derived from Hinode\nintensity maps. Repelling/attracting LCS are found by computing the\nforward/backward finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE).

In engineering applications, end-functionalized polymer\nchains are often employed as agents to reduce drag. These are polymers which\nare floating in the solvent and attach (either by adsorption or through\nirreversible chemical binding) at one of their chain ends to the substrate\n(wall). We propose a PDE model to study this setup in the simple setting where\nthe solvent is a viscous incompressible Navier-Stokes fluid occupying the bulk\nof a smooth domain $\\Omega\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$, and the wall-grafted polymer\nis in the so-called mushroom regime (inter-polymer spacing on the order of the\ntypical polymer length). The microscopic description of the polymer enters into\nthe macroscopic description of the fluid motion through a dynamical boundary\ncondition on the wall-tangential stress of the fluid, something akin to (but\ndistinct from) a history-dependent slip-length.

At the temperature in which the dynamical crossover occurs\ndetermined by the inverse of the diffusion coefficient, we found an excess of\nvibrational states at low frequencies, resembling a pronounced peak in the\nreduced vibrational density of states characteristic of a strong liquid.\nFinally, the behavior of the shear viscosity as a function of reduced\ntemperature (T$_\\text{g}$/T) also shows that, besides the fragile-to-strong\ncrossover nearby T$_\\text{g}$, another dynamical crossover is present near the\nonset of the supercooled regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 21:20:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 21:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

The spectrum can have the observed\naverage low-energy spectral index $\\alpha $ $ \\sim -1$, and the distribution of\nthe low-energy spectral index in our photosphere model is similar to that\nobserved ($-2\\lesssim $ $\\alpha \\lesssim 0$). Furthermore, the two kinds of\nspectral evolutions during the decay phase, separated by the width of the core\n($\\theta _{c}$), are consistent with the time-resolved spectral analysis\nresults of several Fermi multi-pulse GRBs and single-pulse GRBs, respectively.\nAlso, for this photosphere model we can reproduce the two kinds of observed\n$E_{p}$ evolution patterns rather well. Thus, by considering the photospheric\nemission from a structured jet, we reproduce the observations well for the GRBs\nbest fitted by the cutoff power-law model for the peak-flux spectrum or the\ntime-integrated spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 22:42:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 10:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-02"}

This approach does not have an obvious\nphysical interpretation.

In\naddition to the gyroresonance with waves, the transit-time damping (TTD) also\ncontributes to the energy-diffusion for fast and slow-mode waves. While the\nresonance condition with the TTD has been considered to be fulfilled by a very\nsmall fraction of particles, our simulations show that a significant fraction\nof particles are in the TTD resonance owing to the resonance broadening by the\nmirror force, which non-resonantly diffuses the pitch angle of particles. When\nthe cutoff scale in the turbulence spectrum is smaller than the Larmor radius\nof a particle, the gyroresonance is the main acceleration mechanism for all the\nthree wave modes. For the fast-mode, the coexistence of the gyroresonance and\nTTD resonance leads to anomalous energy-diffusion. For a particle with its\nLarmor radius smaller than the cutoff scale, the gyroresonance is negligible,\nand the TTD becomes the dominant mechanism to diffuse its energy.

RuleSets are distributed\nto nodes along a path at connection set up time, and hold lists of operations\nthat need to be performed in real time. We simulate the RuleSet-based quantum\nlink bootstrapping protocol, which consists of recurrent purifications and\nlink-level tomography, to quantify the quantum link fidelity and its\nthroughput. Our Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo simulation includes various error\nsources, such as the memory error, gate error and channel error, modeled on\ncurrently available hardware. We found that when two quantum nodes, each with\n100 memory qubits capable of emitting photons ideally to the optical fiber, are\nphysically connected with a 10km MeetInTheMiddle link, the Recurrent Single\nselection - Single error purification (RSs-Sp) protocol is capable of bringing\nup the fidelity from an average input $F_{r}=0.675$ to around $F_{r}=0.865$\nwith a generation rate of 1106 Bell pairs per second, as determined by\nsimulated tomography.

Unlike the widely-used neural module networks in visual\nQ\\&A, where the language (ie, question) is fully observable, CNM for captioning\nis more challenging as the language is being generated and thus is partially\nobservable. To this end, we make the following technical contributions for CNM\ntraining: 1) compact module design --- one for function words and three for\nvisual content words (eg, noun, adjective, and verb), 2) soft module fusion and\nmulti-step module execution, robustifying the visual reasoning in partial\nobservation, 3) a linguistic loss for module controller being faithful to\npart-of-speech collocations (eg, adjective is before noun).

We define the problem as a determinant maximization and develop a\nunified formulation to decouple the joint problem and select antennas/elements\nin various stages in one integrated problem. We then analyze the performance of\nthe proposed selection approaches and prove that, in terms of the output SINR,\na joint transmit-receive selection method performs best followed by\nmatched-filter, hybrid and factored selection methods. The theoretical results\nare validated numerically, demonstrating that all methods allow an excellent\ntrade-off between performance and cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 07:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Besides, for\nlarge-scale visual search, existing hashing methods cannot directly support the\nefficient search over the data with multiple sources, and while the literature\nhas shown that adaptively incorporating complementary information from diverse\nsources or views can significantly boost the search performance. To address the\nproblems, this paper proposes a novel and generic approach to building multiple\nhash tables with multiple views and generating fine-grained ranking results at\nbitwise and tablewise levels. For each hash table, a query-adaptive bitwise\nweighting is introduced to alleviate the quantization loss by simultaneously\nexploiting the quality of hash functions and their complement for nearest\nneighbor search. From the tablewise aspect, multiple hash tables are built for\ndifferent data views as a joint index, over which a query-specific rank fusion\nis proposed to rerank all results from the bitwise ranking by diffusing in a\ngraph.

This issue has long attracted a\nwide range of attention in computational intelligence and image processing\ncommunities, since, for many practical applications, e.g. object detection and\nrecognition, raw images are usually needed to be appropriately enhanced to\nraise the visual quality (e.g. visibility and contrast). In fact, proper\nenhancement can noticeably improve the quality of input images, even better\nthan originally captured images which are generally thought to be of the best\nquality. In this work, we present two most important contributions. The first\ncontribution is to develop a new no-reference (NR) IQA model. Given an image,\nour quality measure first extracts 17 features through analysis of contrast,\nsharpness, brightness and more, and then yields a measre of visual quality\nusing a regression module, which is learned with big-data training samples that\nare much bigger than the size of relevant image datasets. Results of\nexperiments on nine datasets validate the superiority and efficiency of our\nblind metric compared with typical state-of-the-art full-, reduced- and\nno-reference IQA methods. The second contribution is that a robust image\nenhancement framework is established based on quality optimization. For an\ninput image, by the guidance of the proposed NR-IQA measure, we conduct\nhistogram modification to successively rectify image brightness and contrast to\na proper level. Thorough tests demonstrate that our framework can well enhance\nnatural images, low-contrast images, low-light images and dehazed images.

While increasingly popular in convolutional networks, there\nhave been no previous attempts to achieve domain alignment in recurrent\nnetworks. Similar to spatial features, both source and target domains are\nlikely to exhibit temporal dependencies that can be jointly learnt and aligned.\n  In this paper we introduce Dual-Domain LSTM (DDLSTM), an architecture that is\nable to learn temporal dependencies from two domains concurrently. It performs\ncross-contaminated batch normalisation on both input-to-hidden and\nhidden-to-hidden weights, and learns the parameters for cross-contamination,\nfor both single-layer and multi-layer LSTM architectures. We evaluate DDLSTM on\nframe-level action recognition using three datasets, taking a pair at a time,\nand report an average increase in accuracy of 3.5%.

A natural and common practical task in applications of\nstyle transfer is to adjust the strength of stylization. Algorithm of Gatys et\nal. (2016) provides this ability by changing the weighting factors of content\nand style losses but is computationally inefficient. Real-time style transfer\nintroduced by Johnson et al.

We\nconduct qualitative and quantitative experiments that demonstrate that the\nproposed method is capable of smooth stylization strength control and removes\ncertain stylization artifacts appearing in the original real-time style\ntransfer method. Comparisons with alternative real-time style transfer\nalgorithms, capable of adjusting stylization strength, show that our method\nreproduces style with more details.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 08:58:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-19"}

By making only subtle changes to the input of a\nconvolutional neural network, the output of the network can be swayed to output\na completely different result. The first attacks did this by changing pixel\nvalues of an input image slightly to fool a classifier to output the wrong\nclass. Other approaches have tried to learn \"patches\" that can be applied to an\nobject to fool detectors and classifiers. Some of these approaches have also\nshown that these attacks are feasible in the real-world, i.e. by modifying an\nobject and filming it with a video camera. However, all of these approaches\ntarget classes that contain almost no intra-class variety (e.g. stop signs).\nThe known structure of the object is then used to generate an adversarial patch\non top of it.\n  In this paper, we present an approach to generate adversarial patches to\ntargets with lots of intra-class variety, namely persons. The goal is to\ngenerate a patch that is able successfully hide a person from a person\ndetector.

In this paper, we\nrepresent point spread functions (PSFs) by the linear combination of a set of\npre-defined orthogonal PSFs, and similarly, an estimated intrinsic (EI) sharp\nface image is represented by the linear combination of a set of pre-defined\northogonal face images.

Such a situation can be\ndescribed by a third-order ordinary differential equation (ODE), and typical\ntrajectories approach each equilibrium point in turn, spending progressively\nlonger to cycle around the three points but never stopping. This cycle has been\ninvoked as a model of cyclic competition between populations adopting three\nstrategies, characterised as Rock, Paper and Scissors. When spatial\ndistribution and mobility of the populations is taken into account, waves of\nRock can invade regions of Scissors, only to be invaded by Paper in turn. The\ndynamics is described by a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) that\nhas travelling wave (in one dimension) and spiral (in two dimensions)\nsolutions. In this paper, we explore how the robust heteroclinic cycle in the\nODE manifests itself in the PDEs. Taking the wavespeed as a parameter, and\nmoving into a travelling frame, the PDEs reduce to a sixth-order set of ODEs,\nin which travelling waves are created in a Hopf bifurcation and are destroyed\nin three different heteroclinic bifurcations, depending on parameters, as the\ntravelling wave approaches the heteroclinic cycle. We explore the three\ndifferent heteroclinic bifurcations, none of which have been observed in the\ncontext of robust heteroclinic cycles previously. These results are an\nimportant step towards a full understanding of the spiral patterns found in two\ndimensions, with possible application to travelling waves and spirals in other\npopulation dynamics models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 10:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-19"}

However, there exist various\napproaches to discretize and solve them efficiently. Which of them is best for\na certain scenario is often not known and, in addition, depends heavily on the\nused HPC platform. From a simulation software perspective, this places a\npremium on the ability to adapt easily to different numerical methods and\nhardware architectures. One solution to this problem is to apply code\ngeneration techniques and to express methods and specific hardware-dependent\nimplementations on different levels of abstraction. This allows for a\nseparation of concerns and makes it possible, e.g., to exchange the\ndiscretization scheme without having to rewrite all low-level optimized\nroutines manually.

The operational\napproach to contextuality due to Spekkens requires finding operationally\nequivalent preparation procedures. Previously these have been obtained by\ndemanding indistinguishability under a set of measurements taken to be\ntomographically complete. In the language of generalised probability theories,\nthis requires the ability to explore all the dimensions of the system's state\nspace.

Such extra dimensions could arise\nin post-quantum theories, but even if quantum theory is exact there can be\nunexpected degrees of freedoms due to imperfections in an experiment.

LQ Hya is one of the most frequently studied young solar analogue\nstars. Recently, it has been observed to show intriguing behaviour by analysing\nlong-term photometry: during 2003--2009, a coherent spot structure migrating in\nthe rotational frame has been reported by various authors, but since that time\nthe star has entered a chaotic state where coherent structures seem to have\ndisappeared and rapid phase jumps of the photometric minima occur irregularly\nover time. Aims. LQ Hya is one of the stars included in the SOFIN/FIES\nlong-term monitoring campaign extending over 25 years. Here we publish new\ntemperature maps for the star during 2006--2017, covering the chaotic state of\nthe star. Methods. We use a Doppler imaging technique to derive surface\ntemperature maps from high-resolution spectra. Results. From the mean\ntemperatures of the Doppler maps we see a weak but systematic increase in the\nsurface temperature of the star. This is consistent with the simultaneously\nincreasing photometric magnitude. During nearly all observing seasons we see a\nhigh-latitude spot structure which is clearly nonaxisymmetric. The phase\nbehaviour of this structure is very chaotic but agrees reasonably well with the\nphotometry. Equatorial spots are also frequently seen, but many of them we\ninterpret to be artefacts due to the poor to moderate phase coverage.\nConclusions. Even during the chaotic phase of the star, the spot topology has\nremained very similar to the higher activity epochs with more coherent and\nlong-lived spot structures: we see high-latitude and equatorial spot activity,\nthe mid latitude range still being most often void of spots. We interpret the\nerratic jumps and drifts in phase of the photometric minima to be caused by\nchanges in the high-latitude spot structure rather than the equatorial spots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 11:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

Our method uses a work-function-based exchange potential in\nconjunction with the popular gradient-corrected Lee-Yang-Parr correlation\nfunctional. The resulting Kohn-Sham equation, in the non-relativistic\nframework, is numerically solved accurately and efficiently by means of a\ngeneralized pseudospectral method through a non-uniform, optimal spatial\ndiscretization. This has been applied to a variety of excited states, such as\nlow and high states; single, double, triple as well as multiple excitations;\nvalence and core excitations; autoionizing states; satellites; hollow and\ndoubly-hollow states; very high-lying Rydberg resonances; etc., of atoms and\nions, with remarkable success. A thorough and systematic comparison with\nliterature data reveals that, for all these systems, the exchange-only results\nare practically of Hartree-Fock quality; while with inclusion of correlation,\nthis offers excellent agreement with available experimental data as well as\nthose obtained from other sophisticated theoretical methods.

One epoch of such training process based on a naive optimization of\nthe triplet loss function has a run-time complexity O(N^3), where N is the\nnumber of training samples. Such optimization scales poorly, and the most\ncommon approach proposed to address this high complexity issue is based on\nsub-sampling the set of triplets needed for the training process. Another\napproach explored in the field relies on an ad-hoc linearization (in terms of\nN) of the triplet loss that introduces class centroids, which must be optimized\nusing the whole training set for each mini-batch - this means that a naive\nimplementation of this approach has run-time complexity O(N^2). This complexity\nissue is usually mitigated with poor, but computationally cheap, approximate\ncentroid optimization methods. In this paper, we first propose a solid theory\non the linearization of the triplet loss with the use of class centroids, where\nthe main conclusion is that our new linear loss represents a tight upper-bound\nto the triplet loss. Furthermore, based on the theory above, we propose a\ntraining algorithm that no longer requires the centroid optimization step,\nwhich means that our approach is the first in the field with a guaranteed\nlinear run-time complexity.

Meanwhile, in gentle measurement, we want to measure n\nquantum states, in a way that \"damages the states by at most alpha,\" even\nconditioned on any outcome of the measurement. In both cases, we can achieve\nthe goal by techniques like deliberately adding noise to the outcome before\nreturning it. This paper proves a new and general connection between the two\nsubjects. Specifically, we show that on products of n quantum states, any\nmeasurement that is alpha-gentle for small alpha is also O(alpha)-DP, and any\nproduct measurement that is eps-DP is also O(eps*sqrt(n))-gentle. Illustrating\nthe power of this connection, we apply it to the recently studied problem of\nshadow tomography. Given an unknown d-dimensional quantum state rho, as well as\nknown two-outcome measurements E_1,...,E_m, shadow tomography asks us to\nestimate Pr[E_i accepts rho], for every i in [m], by measuring few copies of\nrho. Using our connection theorem, together with a quantum analog of the\nso-called private multiplicative weights algorithm of Hardt and Rothblum, we\ngive a protocol to solve this problem using O((log m)^2 (log d)^2) copies of\nrho, compared to Aaronson's previous bound of ~O((log m)^4 (log d)). Our\nprotocol has the advantages of being online (that is, the E_i's are processed\none at a time), gentle, and conceptually simple. Other applications of our\nconnection include new lower bounds for shadow tomography from lower bounds on\nDP, and a result on the safe use of estimation algorithms as subroutines inside\nlarger quantum algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 13:08:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-19"}

In this study, we present a transparent deep learning\nframework relying on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and layer-wise\nrelevance propagation (LRP) for diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS).

The goal of this paper is to introduce the benefits of FRI in the\nIntrusion Detection Systems (IDS) application area, in the design and\nimplementation of the detection mechanism for Distributed Denial of Service\n(DDOS) attacks. In the example of the paper as a test-bed environment an open\nsource DDOS dataset and the General Public License (GNU) FRI Toolbox was\napplied. The performance of the FRI-IDS example application is compared to\nother common classification algorithms used for detecting DDOS attacks on the\nsame open source test-bed environment. According to the results, the overall\ndetection rate of the FRI-IDS is in pair with other methods. On the example\ndataset it outperforms the detection rate of the support vector machine\nalgorithm, whereas other algorithms (neural network, random forest and decision\ntree) recorded lightly higher detection rate. Consequently, the FRI inference\nsystem could be a suitable approach to be implemented as a detection mechanism\nfor IDS; it effectively decreases the false positive rate value. Moreover,\nbecause of its fuzzy rule base knowledge representation nature, it can easily\nadapt expert knowledge, and also be-suitable for predicting the level of degree\nfor threat possibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 13:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-19"}

The dream is to beat humans in this new fast-paced sport. A common\napproach is to learn an end-to-end policy that directly predicts controls from\nraw images by imitating an expert. However, such a policy is limited by the\nexpert it imitates and scaling to other environments and vehicle dynamics is\ndifficult. One approach to overcome the drawbacks of an end-to-end policy is to\ntrain a network only on the perception task and handle control with a PID or\nMPC controller. However, a single controller must be extensively tuned and\ncannot usually cover the whole state space. In this paper, we propose learning\nan optimized controller using a DNN that fuses multiple controllers. The\nnetwork learns a robust controller with online trajectory filtering, which\nsuppresses noisy trajectories and imperfections of individual controllers. The\nresult is a network that is able to learn a good fusion of filtered\ntrajectories from different controllers leading to significant improvements in\noverall performance. We compare our trained network to controllers it has\nlearned from, end-to-end baselines and human pilots in a realistic simulation;\nour network beats all baselines in extensive experiments and approaches the\nperformance of a professional human pilot.

Recently, it is reported that the\ncapability of signal restoration is fundamentally limited by the\nperception-distortion tradeoff, i.e. the distortion and the perceptual\ndifference between the restored signal and the ideal `original' signal cannot\nbe made both minimal simultaneously. Distortion corresponds to signal fidelity\nand perceptual difference corresponds to perceptual naturalness, both of which\nare important metrics in practice. Besides, there is another dimension worthy\nof consideration, namely the semantic quality or the utility for recognition\npurpose, of the restored signal. In this paper, we extend the previous\nperception-distortion tradeoff to the case of\nclassification-distortion-perception (CDP) tradeoff, where we introduced the\nclassification error rate of the restored signal in addition to distortion and\nperceptual difference. Two versions of the CDP tradeoff are considered, one\nusing a predefined classifier and the other dealing with the optimal classifier\nfor the restored signal. For both versions, we can rigorously prove the\nexistence of the CDP tradeoff, i.e. the distortion, perceptual difference, and\nclassification error rate cannot be made all minimal simultaneously. Our\nfindings can be useful especially for computer vision researches where some\nlow-level vision tasks (signal restoration) serve for high-level vision tasks\n(visual understanding).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:43:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

Although the environmental interaction cannot be detected by any\nsensors (hence unknown), passivity allows us to have natural interaction. An\nanalysis shows that the behavior of the actual system mimics that of a nominal\nmodel as the control gain goes to infinity, which implies that the proposed\napproach is an admittance controller. However, because the control gain cannot\ngrow infinitely in practice, the performance limitation according to the\nachievable control gain is also analyzed.

To this effect, it is imperative to\nunderstand the mechanisms that enable their energy to be transferred to the\nplasma. Mode conversion via resonant absorption is believed to be one of the\nmain mechanisms for kink wave damping, and is considered to play a key role in\nthe process of energy transfer. This study examines the damping of propagating\nkink waves in quiescent coronal loops using the Coronal Multi-channel\nPolarimeter (CoMP). A coherence-based method is used to track the Doppler\nvelocity signal of the waves, enabling us to investigate the spatial evolution\nof velocity perturbations. The power ratio of outward to inward propagating\nwaves is used to estimate the associated damping lengths and quality factors.\nTo enable accurate estimates of these quantities, {we provide the first\nderivation of a likelihood function suitable for fitting models to the ratio of\ntwo power spectra obtained from discrete Fourier transforms. Maximum likelihood\nestimation is used to fit an exponential damping model to the observed\nvariation in power ratio as a function of frequency.} We confirm earlier\nindications that propagating kink waves are undergoing frequency dependent\ndamping. Additionally, we find that the rate of damping decreases, or\nequivalently the damping length increases, for longer coronal loops that reach\nhigher in the corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 15:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

Collisionless energy transfer from the turbulence to the\nparticles can take place reversibly, resulting in non-thermal energy in the\nparticle velocity distribution functions (VDFs) before eventual collisional\nthermalization is realized. Exploiting the information contained in the\nfluctuations in the VDFs is valuable.

One way to improve efficacy is by enhancing foliar penetration. The\nplant leaf cuticle is the most significant barrier to agrochemical diffusion\nwithin the leaf. It has been noted that a comprehensive set of mechanisms for\nionic active ingredient penetration through plant leaves with surfactants is\nnot well defined and oils that enhance penetration have been given little\nattention. The importance of a mechanistic mathematical model has been noted\npreviously in the literature. Two mechanistic mathematical models have been\npreviously developed by the authors, focusing on plant cuticle penetration of\ncalcium chloride through tomato fruit cuticles. The models included ion binding\nand evaporation with hygroscopic water absorption, along with the ability to\nvary the active ingredient concentration and type, relative humidity and plant\nspecies. Here we further develop these models to include lipophilic adjuvant\neffects, as well as the adsorption and desorption of compounds on the cuticle\nsurface with a novel Adaptive Competitive Langmuir model. These modifications\nto a penetration model provide a novel addition to the literature. We validate\nour theoretical model results against appropriate experimental data, discuss\nkey sensitivities and relate theoretical predictions to physical mechanisms.\nThe results indicate the addition of the desorption mechanism may be one way to\npredict increased penetration at late times and the sensitivity of model\nparameters compares wells to those present in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 10:15:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 06:38:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 2019 00:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-09"}

Based on ontological analysis and a corresponding\ndefinition of a modeling notation as ontology we show that business process\nmodels can be transformed from one notation into another one as long as there\nare common underlying concepts; this is demonstrated with the case of an actor\nbased, or subject-oriented, view on business processes. Furthermore, a\nreference architecture for Workflow Management Systems (WfMS) based on\nmicroservices is discussed which is capable of executing actor based business\nprocess models. As a transformation of BPMN models into the actor based view is\ngenerally possible, also BPMN models could be enacted. As a result, we can\nconclude that the actor system is a promising way to stimulate new ways to\ndesign workflow management systems and to design business process modeling\nlanguages which are more comfortable to use by non-experts without losing\nnecessary expressiveness. Another result is that an ontology is a productive\nway to define a modeling notation as it can be used as knowledge base, it is a\nformal conceptualization of the underlying notions, and can be semantically\nenriched for further use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 10:30:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-03"}

To this aim we collected a large dataset\nof diffusion networks on Twitter pertaining to news articles published on two\ndistinct classes of sources, namely outlets that convey mainstream, reliable\nand objective information and those that fabricate and disseminate various\nkinds of misleading articles, including false news intended to harm, satire\nintended to make people laugh, click-bait news that may be entirely factual or\nrumors that are unproven.

We\naccordingly evaluated to what extent these techniques allow to discriminate\nbetween the networks associated to the aforementioned news domains.

As a newly-developed media\nformat which is characterized by complexity and irregularity, point cloud\ncreates a need for compression algorithms which are more flexible than existing\ncodecs. Recently, autoencoders(AEs) have shown their effectiveness in many\nvisual analysis tasks as well as image compression, which inspires us to employ\nit in point cloud compression. In this paper, we propose a general\nautoencoder-based architecture for lossy geometry point cloud compression. To\nthe best of our knowledge, it is the first autoencoder-based geometry\ncompression codec that directly takes point clouds as input rather than voxel\ngrids or collections of images. Compared with handcrafted codecs, this approach\nadapts much more quickly to previously unseen media contents and media formats,\nmeanwhile achieving competitive performance. Our architecture consists of a\npointnet-based encoder, a uniform quantizer, an entropy estimation block and a\nnonlinear synthesis transformation module.
