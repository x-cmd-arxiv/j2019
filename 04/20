In many applications, e.g. learning\nwith large output spaces, it has been empirically observed that these\nalgorithms fail to converge to an optimal solution (or a critical point in\nnonconvex settings). We show that one cause for such failures is the\nexponential moving average used in the algorithms. We provide an explicit\nexample of a simple convex optimization setting where Adam does not converge to\nthe optimal solution, and describe the precise problems with the previous\nanalysis of Adam algorithm. Our analysis suggests that the convergence issues\ncan be fixed by endowing such algorithms with `long-term memory' of past\ngradients, and propose new variants of the Adam algorithm which not only fix\nthe convergence issues but often also lead to improved empirical performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 16:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-22"}

Although these dynamic flows\nreveal a characteristic length scale resulting from the interplay between\nactive forcing and passive restoring forces, the observation of static and\nlong-range spatial patterns in active gels has remained elusive. In this work,\nwe demonstrate that a 2D free-standing nematic active gel, formed spontaneously\nby depletion forces from a 3D solution of kinesin motors and microtubule\nfilaments, actively buckles out-of-plane into a centimeter-sized periodic\ncorrugated sheet that is stable for several days at low activity. Importantly,\nthe corrugations are formed in the absence of flow and their wavelength and\nstability are controlled by the motor concentration, in agreement with a\nhydrodynamic theory. At higher activities these patterns are transient with the\ngel becoming turbulent at longer times. Our results underline the importance of\nboth passive and active forces in shaping active gels and indicate that a\nstatic material can be sculpted through an active mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 16:02:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

Current solutions either rely on vision\ndata, which is susceptible to environmental and lighting conditions, or fusion\nof kinematic and contact data with measurements from an inertial measurement\nunit (IMU). In this work, we develop a contact-aided invariant extended Kalman\nfilter (InEKF) using the theory of Lie groups and invariant observer design.\nThis filter combines contact-inertial dynamics with forward kinematic\ncorrections to estimate pose and velocity along with all current contact\npoints. We show that the error dynamics follows a log-linear autonomous\ndifferential equation with several important consequences: (a) the observable\nstate variables can be rendered convergent with a domain of attraction that is\nindependent of the system's trajectory; (b) unlike the standard EKF, neither\nthe linearized error dynamics nor the linearized observation model depend on\nthe current state estimate, which (c) leads to improved convergence properties\nand (d) a local observability matrix that is consistent with the underlying\nnonlinear system.

Races often lead to nondeterministic and incorrect program behavior. A\ndata race is a special case of a determinacy race which can be eliminated by\nassociating a mutual-exclusion lock or allowing atomic accesses to the memory\nlocation. However, such solutions can reduce parallelism by serializing all\naccesses to that location. For associative and commutative updates, reducers\nallow parallel race-free updates at the expense of using some extra space. We\nask the following question. Given a fixed budget of extra space to mitigate the\ncost of races in a parallel program, which memory locations should be assigned\nreducers and how should the space be distributed among the reducers in order to\nminimize the overall running time? We argue that the races can be captured by a\ndirected acyclic graph (DAG), with nodes representing memory cells and arcs\nrepresenting read-write dependencies between cells. We then formulate our\noptimization problem on DAGs. We concentrate on a variation of this problem\nwhere space reuse among reducers is allowed by routing extra space along a\nsource to sink path of the DAG and using it in the construction of reducers\nalong the path. We consider two reducers and the corresponding duration\nfunctions (i.e., reduction time as a function of space budget). We generalize\nour race-avoiding space-time tradeoff problem to a discrete resource-time\ntradeoff problem with general non-increasing duration functions and resource\nreuse over paths. For general DAGs, the offline problem is strongly NP-hard\nunder all three duration functions, and we give approximation algorithms. We\nalso prove hardness of approximation for the general resource-time tradeoff\nproblem and give a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for series-parallel DAGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 17:48:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-22"}

Despite the enormous heterogeneity of apps usage, we\nfind that individuals exhibit a conserved capacity that limits the number of\napplications they regularly use. Moreover, we find that this capacity steadily\ndecreases with age, as does the capacity in the physical space but with more\ncomplex dynamics. Even though people might have the same capacity, applications\nget added and removed over time. In this respect, we identify two profiles of\nindividuals: app keepers and explorers, which differ in their stable (keepers)\nvs exploratory (explorers) behaviour regarding their use of mobile\napplications. Finally, we show that the capacity of applications predicts\nmobility capacity and vice-versa. By contrast, the behaviour of keepers and\nexplorers may considerably vary across the two domains. Our empirical findings\nprovide an intriguing picture linking human behaviour in the physical and\ndigital worlds which bridges research studies from Computer Science, Social\nPhysics and Computational Social Sciences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 21:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-23"}

This paper suggests a novel algorithm\ncalled Donkey and Smuggler Optimization Algorithm (DSO). The DSO is inspired by\nthe searching behavior of donkeys. The algorithm imitates transportation\nbehavior such as searching and selecting routes for movement by donkeys in the\nactual world. Two modes are established for implementing the search behavior\nand route-selection in this algorithm. These are the Smuggler and Donkeys. In\nthe Smuggler mode, all the possible paths are discovered and the shortest path\nis then found. In the Donkeys mode, several donkey behaviors are utilized such\nas Run, Face & Suicide, and Face & Support. Real world data and applications\nare used to test the algorithm. The experimental results consisted of two\nparts, firstly, we used the standard benchmark test functions to evaluate the\nperformance of the algorithm in respect to the most popular and the state of\nthe art algorithms. Secondly, the DSO is adapted and implemented on three\nreal-world applications namely; traveling salesman problem, packet routing, and\nambulance routing.

Strikingly, the\nreduction of the anomalous Hall conductivity above 90 K linearly follows the\ndisappearance of the volume fraction of the ferromagnetic state. We further\nshow that the competition of these magnetic phases is tunable through applying\neither an external magnetic field or hydrostatic pressure.

We then strengthen the\nlinear relaxation of the underlying MILP model by introducing constraints to\nbound the reward function based on the precomputed reward potentials.\nExperimentally, we show that our algorithm efficiently computes reward\npotentials for learned NN models, and that the overhead of computing reward\npotentials is justified by the overall strengthening of the underlying MILP\nmodel for the task of planning over long horizons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 23:15:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 May 2019 07:03:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 19 May 2019 11:01:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 14:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-29"}

This paper\nproposes a new transform method figuratively named as funnel transform which\ncan efficiently and rapidly detect straight lines. The funnel transform\nconsists of three 1D Fourier transforms and one nonlinear variable-metric\ntransform (NVMT). It only needs to exploit 1D interpolation operation for\nachieving its NVMT, and can directly handle grayscale images by using its\nhigh-pass filter property, which significantly improves the performance of the\nclosely-related approaches. Based on the slope-intercept line equation, the\nfunnel transform can more uniformly turn the straight lines formed by\nridge-typical and step-typical edges into the local maximum points (peaks). The\nparameters of each line can be uniquely extracted from its corresponding peak\ncoordinates. Additionally, each peak can be theoretically specified by a 2D\ndelta function, which makes the peaks and lines more easily identified and\ndetected, respectively.

Assuming a log-normal distribution, the mean explosion energy for\nthe observations is $\\mu_{\\rm obs} = -0.13\\pm 0.05$ ($\\log_{10}(E/10^{51}\\,\n{\\rm erg})$) and the width is $\\sigma_{\\rm obs} = 0.21^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$. Only\nthree CCSN codes have sufficient simulations to compare with observations:\nCHIMERA, CoCoNuT-FMT, and FORNAX. Currently, FORNAX has the largest sample of\nsimulations. The two-dimensional FORNAX simulations show a correlation between\nexplosion energy and progenitor mass, ranging from linear to quadratic, $E_{\\rm\nsim} \\propto M^{1-2}$; this correlation is consistent with inferences from\nobservations.

Previous research has investigated\ninformation fusion of connected layers or multiple branches in a block, seeking\nto strengthen the power of multi-scale representations. Despite their great\nsuccesses, existing practices often allocate the neurons for each scale\nmanually, and keep the same ratio in all aggregation blocks of an entire\nnetwork, rendering suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose to learn\nthe neuron allocation for aggregating multi-scale information in different\nbuilding blocks of a deep network. The most informative output neurons in each\nblock are preserved while others are discarded, and thus neurons for multiple\nscales are competitively and adaptively allocated. Our scale aggregation\nnetwork (ScaleNet) is constructed by repeating a scale aggregation (SA) block\nthat concatenates feature maps at a wide range of scales. Feature maps for each\nscale are generated by a stack of downsampling, convolution and upsampling\noperations. The data-driven neuron allocation and SA block achieve strong\nrepresentational power at the cost of considerably low computational\ncomplexity. The proposed ScaleNet, by replacing all 3x3 convolutions in ResNet\nwith our SA blocks, achieves better performance than ResNet and its outstanding\nvariants like ResNeXt and SE-ResNet, in the same computational complexity. On\nImageNet classification, ScaleNets absolutely reduce the top-1 error rate of\nResNets by 1.12 (101 layers) and 1.82 (50 layers). On COCO object detection,\nScaleNets absolutely improve the mmAP with backbone of ResNets by 3.6 (101\nlayers) and 4.6 (50 layers) on Faster RCNN, respectively.

However, there are reasons to believe that GR may need to be modified\nbecause it includes singularities (it is an incomplete theory) and also it\nrequires fine-tuning to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe\nthrough the cosmological constant. Thus, it is important to check various\nexperiments and observations beyond the above range of scales for possible\nhints of deviations from the predictions of GR. If such hints are found it is\nimportant to understand which classes of modified gravity theories are\nconsistent with them. The goal of this review is to summarize recent progress\non these issues. On sub millimeter scales we show an analysis of the data of\nthe Washington experiment (Kapner et al. (2007)) searching for modifications of\nNewton's Law on sub-millimeter scales and demonstrate that a spatially\noscillating signal is hidden in this dataset. We show that even though this\nsignal cannot be explained in the context of standard modified theories (viable\nscalar tensor and $f(R)$ theories), it is a rather generic prediction of\nnonlocal gravity theories. On cosmological scales we review recent analyses of\nRedshift Space Distortion data which measure the growth rate of cosmological\nperturbations at various redshifts and show that these data are in some tension\nwith the $\\Lambda$CDM parameter values indicated by Planck/2015 CMB data at\nabout 3$\\sigma$ level. This tension can be reduced by allowing for an evolution\nof the effective Newton constant that determines the growth rate of\ncosmological perturbations. We conclude that even though this tension between\nthe data and the predictions of GR could be due to systematic/statistical\nuncertainties of the data, it could also constitute early hints of a new\ngravitational theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2019 15:40:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 18:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

Given a graph and a set of attributes for each\nvertex, attributed subgraph mining aims to find cohesive subgraphs for which (a\nsubset of) the attribute values has exceptional values in some sense. While\nresearch on this task can borrow from the three abovementioned fields, the\nprincipled integration of graph and attribute data poses two challenges: the\ndefinition of a pattern language that is intuitive and lends itself to\nefficient search strategies, and the formalization of the interestingness of\nsuch patterns.

Due to the dynamic nature of the surrounding world of these systems,\nassuring the satisfaction of their properties at runtime and in the presence of\na change is important. A prominent approach to assure the correct behavior of\nthese systems is verification at runtime, which has strict time and memory\nlimitations. To tackle these limitations, we propose Magnifier, an iterative,\nincremental, and compositional verification approach that operates on a\ncomponent-based model. The Magnifier idea is zooming on the component affected\nby a change, verifying the correctness of properties of interest of the system\nafter adapting the component to the change, and then zooming out and tracing\nthe change if it propagates. If the change propagates, all components affected\nby the change are adapted and are composed to form a new component. Magnifier\nrepeats the same process for the new component. This iterative process\nterminates whenever the propagation of the change stops. In Magnifier, we use\nthe Coordinated Adaptive Actor model (CoodAA) of traffic control systems. We\npresent a formal semantics for CoodAA as a network of Timed Input-Output\nAutomata (TIOAs). The change does not propagate if TIOAs of the adapted\ncomponent and its environment are compatible.
