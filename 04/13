In this paper, we provide a contemporary survey\nof AL, focused particularly on defenses against attacks on statistical\nclassifiers. After introducing relevant terminology and the goals and range of\npossible knowledge of both attackers and defenders, we survey recent work on\ntest-time evasion (TTE), data poisoning (DP), and reverse engineering (RE)\nattacks and particularly defenses against same. In so doing, we distinguish\nrobust classification from anomaly detection (AD), unsupervised from\nsupervised, and statistical hypothesis-based defenses from ones that do not\nhave an explicit null (no attack) hypothesis; we identify the hyperparameters a\nparticular method requires, its computational complexity, as well as the\nperformance measures on which it was evaluated and the obtained quality. We\nthen dig deeper, providing novel insights that challenge conventional AL wisdom\nand that target unresolved issues, including: 1) robust classification versus\nAD as a defense strategy; 2) the belief that attack success increases with\nattack strength, which ignores susceptibility to AD; 3) small perturbations for\ntest-time evasion attacks: a fallacy or a requirement?; 4) validity of the\nuniversal assumption that a TTE attacker knows the ground-truth class for the\nexample to be attacked; 5) black, grey, or white box attacks as the standard\nfor defense evaluation; 6) susceptibility of query-based RE to an AD defense.\nWe also discuss attacks on the privacy of training data. We then present\nbenchmark comparisons of several defenses against TTE, RE, and backdoor DP\nattacks on images. The paper concludes with a discussion of future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 16:05:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 May 2019 17:15:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 2019 22:49:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

We found that, among the 33492 phonons of a fully relaxed\n$\\theta=1.08^\\circ$ twisted bilayer, there are few special, hard and nearly\ndispersionless modes that resemble global vibrations of the moir\\'e supercell,\nas if it were a single, ultralarge molecule.

The JT coupling lifts very\nefficiently all degeneracies which arise from the valley symmetry, and may\nlead, for an average atomic displacement as small as $0.5~$mA, to an insulating\nstate at charge neutrality. This insulator possesses a non-trivial topology\ntestified by the odd winding of the Wilson loop. In addition, freezing the same\nphonon at a zone boundary point brings about insulating states at most integer\noccupancies of the four ultra-flat electronic bands. Following that line, we\nfurther study the properties of the superconducting state that might be\nstabilized by these modes. Since the JT coupling modulates the hopping between\nAB and BA stacked regions, pairing occurs in the spin-singlet Cooper channel at\nthe inter-(AB-BA) scale, which may condense a superconducting order parameter\nin the extended $s$-wave and/or $d\\pm id$-wave symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 16:11:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 17:10:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2019 08:32:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 18:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

Such task is only possible under\ncomputational assumptions. In this contribution we define a simpler (basic)\nprimitive consisting of only BB84 states, and give a protocol that realizes\nthis primitive and that is secure against the strongest possible adversary (an\narbitrarily deviating malicious server). The specific functions used, were\nconstructed based on known trapdoor one-way functions, resulting to the\nsecurity of our basic primitive being reduced to the hardness of the Learning\nWith Errors problem. We then give a number of extensions, building on this\nbasic module: extension to larger set of states (that includes non-Clifford\nstates); proper consideration of the abort case; and verifiablity on the module\nlevel.

In the case of a scalar-type curvature\nperturbation, it is known that the amplitude of these oscillations may be\nenhanced to result in the power spectrum larger than the one for the vacuum\ncase. One might expect the similar enhancement for the tensor perturbation as\nwell. Unfortunately, it is found that when the equation of state (EOS)\nparameter $w=p/\\rho$ of the break stage is a constant with $w>-1/3$, the\namplitude of oscillations is never large enough to enhance the power spectrum.\nOn the contrary, the power spectrum is found to be suppressed even on those\nscales that leave the horizon at the first inflationary stage and remain\nsuperhorizon throughout the entire stage. We identify the cause of this\nsuppression with the correction terms in additional to the leading order\nconstant solution on superhorizon scales.

In this work,\nwe rely on the Hilbert structure of the observation space to express our\nrecovery results as a property of the kernel defined by the inner product\nbetween two atoms. Using a continuous extension of Tropp's Exact Recovery\nCondition, we identify key assumptions allowing to analyze OMP in the\ncontinuous setting. Under these assumptions, OMP unambiguously identifies in\nexactly $k$ steps the atom parameters from any observed linear combination of\n$k$ atoms. These parameters play the role of the so-called support of a sparse\nrepresentation in traditional sparse recovery. In our paper, any kernel and set\nof parameters that satisfy these conditions are said to be admissible. In the\none-dimensional setting, we exhibit a family of kernels relying on completely\nmonotone functions for which admissibility holds for any set of atom\nparameters. For higher dimensional parameter spaces, the analysis turns out to\nbe more subtle. An additional assumption, so-called axis admissibility, is\nimposed to ensure a form of delayed recovery (in at most $k^D$ steps, where $D$\nis the dimension of the parameter space).

An\nadversary called Eve, which captures environmental noise and potentially\nmalicious interference, aims to disrupt this process via jamming. Assume\nsending, listening, or jamming on one channel for one time slot costs unit\nenergy. The question is, if Eve spends $T$ units of energy on jamming, can we\ndevise broadcast algorithms in which each node's cost is $o(T)$? Previous\nresults show such resource competitive algorithms do exist in the\nsingle-channel setting: each node can receive the message within\n$\\tilde{O}(T+n)$ time slots while spending only $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T/n}+1)$\nenergy.\n  In this paper, we show that when Eve is oblivious, the existence of multiple\nchannels allows even faster message dissemination, while preserving resource\ncompetitiveness. Specifically, we have identified an efficient \"epidemic\nbroadcast\" scheme in the multi-channel setting that is robust again jamming.\nExtending this scheme leads to a randomized algorithm called MultiCast which\nuses $n/2$ channels, and accomplishes broadcast in $\\tilde{O}(T/n+1)$ time\nslots while costing each node only $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T/n}+1)$ energy.

Recent measurements of the $8$--$24$ keV AGN number counts by\nNuSTAR and Swift-BAT are unable to be simultaneously described by existing XRB\nsynthesis models, indicating a fundamental breakdown in our understanding of\nAGN evolution. Here we show that the $8$--$24$ keV AGN number counts can be\nsuccessfully modeled with an XRB synthesis model in which the reflection\nstrength ($R$) in the spectral model increases with redshift. We show that an\nincrease in reflection strength with redshift is a natural outcome of (1)\nconnecting $R$ to the incidence of high column density gas around AGNs, and (2)\nthe growth in the AGN obscured fraction to higher redshifts. In addition to the\nredshift evolution of $R$, we also find tentative evidence that an increasing\nCompton-thick fraction with $z$ is necessary to describe the $8$--$24$ keV AGN\nnumber counts determined by NuSTAR. These results show that, in contrast to the\ntraditional orientation-based AGN unification model, the nature and covering\nfactor of the absorbing gas and dust around AGNs evolve over time and must be\nconnected to physical processes in the AGN environment. Future XRB synthesis\nmodels must allow for the redshift evolution of AGN spectral parameters.

As data annotation requires\nmassive human labor from experienced radiologists, it is common that training\ndata are partially labeled, e.g., pancreas datasets only have the pancreas\nlabeled while leaving the rest marked as background. However, these background\nlabels can be misleading in multi-organ segmentation since the \"background\"\nusually contains some other organs of interest. To address the background\nambiguity in these partially-labeled datasets, we propose Prior-aware Neural\nNetwork (PaNN) via explicitly incorporating anatomical priors on abdominal\norgan sizes, guiding the training process with domain-specific knowledge.

The particle velocity fields contain a significant component of\nrandom uncorrelated motion, more prominent for higher St and in the near-wall\nregion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 19:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

The\npseudo-disc is a bright feature in the CO position-velocity diagram (PVD),\nelongated in a direction perpendicular to the jet axis, with a total (gas+dust)\nmass of $\\sim$0.02 M$_{\\odot}$, size of 165-192 AU, and a velocity spread of\n$\\pm$2 km s$^{-1}$. The large velocity gradient is a combination of infalling\nand rotational motions, indicating a contribution from a pseudo-disc and an\nunresolved inner Keplerian disc. There is weak emission detected in the\nH$_{2}$CO (3-2) and N$_{2}$D$^{+}$ (3-2) lines. H$_{2}$CO emission likely\nprobes the inner Keplerian disc where CO is expected to be frozen, while\nN$_{2}$D$^{+}$ possibly originates from an enhanced clump at the outer edge of\nthe pseudo-disc. We have considered various models (core collapse, disc\nfragmentation, circum-binary disc) that can fit both the observed CO spectrum\nand the position-velocity offsets. The observed morphology, velocity structure,\nand the physical dimensions of the pseudo-disc are consistent with the\npredictions from the core collapse simulations for brown dwarf formation.

However, to\nachieve the required confinement, the magnetic geometry must be highly\noptimized. This optimization requires navigating high-dimensional spaces, often\nnecessitating the use of gradient-based methods. The gradient of the\nneoclassical fluxes is expensive to compute with classical methods, requiring\n$O(N)$ flux computations, where $N$ is the number of parameters. To reduce the\ncost of the gradient computation, we present an adjoint method for computing\nthe derivatives of moments of the neoclassical distribution function for\nstellarator optimization. The linear adjoint method allows derivatives of\nquantities which depend on solutions of a linear system, such as moments of the\ndistribution function, to be computed with respect to many parameters from the\nsolution of only two linear systems. This reduces the cost of computing the\ngradient to the point that the finite-collisionality neoclassical fluxes can be\nused within an optimization loop.\n  With the neoclassical adjoint method, we compute solutions of the drift\nkinetic equation and an adjoint drift kinetic equation to obtain derivatives of\nneoclassical quantities with respect to geometric parameters.

Despite the\nimportance of accurately modeling the temporal information, most embedding\nmethods ignore it entirely or approximate the temporal network using a sequence\nof static snapshot graphs. In this work, we propose using the notion of\ntemporal walks for learning dynamic embeddings from temporal networks. Temporal\nwalks capture the temporally valid interactions (e.g., flow of information,\nspread of disease) in the dynamic network in a lossless fashion. Based on the\nnotion of temporal walks, we describe a general class of embeddings called\ncontinuous-time dynamic network embeddings (CTDNEs) that completely avoid the\nissues and problems that arise when approximating the temporal network as a\nsequence of static snapshot graphs. Unlike previous work, CTDNEs learn dynamic\nnode embeddings directly from the temporal network at the finest temporal\ngranularity and thus use only temporally valid information. As such CTDNEs\nnaturally support online learning of the node embeddings in a streaming\nreal-time fashion. Finally, the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthis class of embedding methods that leverage temporal walks as it achieves an\naverage gain in AUC of 11.9% across all methods and graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:44:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 15:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

In the short-time regime, NPs exhibit\nanomalous dispersive behaviors under high shear and high haematocrit due to the\ntransient elongation and alignment of the red blood cells (RBCs). In the\nlong-time regime, the NP diffusion tensor features high anisotropy.\nParticularly, there exists a critical shear rate ($\\sim$100 $s^{-1}$) around\nwhich the shear-rate dependence of the diffusivity tensor changes from linear\nto nonlinear scale. Above the critical shear rate, the cross-stream diffusivity\nterms vary sublinearly with shear rate, while the longitudinal term varies\nsuperlinearly. The dependence on haematocrit is linear in general except at\nhigh shear rates, where a sublinear scale is found for the vorticity term and a\nquadratic scale for the longitudinal term. Through analysis of the suspension\nmicrostructure and numerical experiments, the nonlinear hemorheological\ndependence of the NP diffusion tensor is attributed to the streamwise\nelongation and cross-stream contraction of RBCs under high shear, quantified by\na Capillary number.

Topic Grouper creates a disjunctive partitioning\nof the training vocabulary in a stepwise manner such that resulting partitions\nrepresent topics. It is governed by a simple generative model, where the\nlikelihood to generate the training documents via topics is optimized. The\nalgorithm starts with one-word topics and joins two topics at every step. It\ntherefore generates a solution for every desired number of topics ranging\nbetween the size of the training vocabulary and one. The process represents an\nagglomerative clustering that corresponds to a binary tree of topics. A\nresulting tree may act as a containment hierarchy, typically with more general\ntopics towards the root of tree and more specific topics towards the leaves.\nTopic Grouper is not governed by a background distribution such as the\nDirichlet and avoids hyper parameter optimizations.\n  We show that Topic Grouper has reasonable predictive power and also a\nreasonable theoretical and practical complexity. Topic Grouper can deal well\nwith stop words and function words and tends to push them into their own\ntopics. Also, it can handle topic distributions, where some topics are more\nfrequent than others. We present typical examples of computed topics from\nevaluation datasets, where topics appear conclusive and coherent. In this\ncontext, the fact that each word belongs to exactly one topic is not a major\nlimitation; in some scenarios this can even be a genuine advantage, e.g.~a\nrelated shopping basket analysis may aid in optimizing groupings of articles in\nsales catalogs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Apr 2019 05:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

Proper measures are important for various tasks, such as\nprogress indication and action prioritization in cleaning systems, and\nreliability estimation for new datasets. To choose an appropriate inconsistency\nmeasure, it is important to identify the desired properties in the application\nand understand which of these is guaranteed or at least expected in practice.\nFor example, in some use cases the inconsistency should reduce if constraints\nare eliminated; in others it should be stable and avoid jitters and jumps in\nreaction to small changes in the database.

If $G$ has at least one $R_g$-cutset, the\n\\emph{$g$-extra connectivity} of $G$, denoted by $\\kappa_g(G)$, is then defined\nas the minimum cardinality over all $R_g$-cutsets of $G$. In this paper, we\nfirst obtain the exact values of $g$-extra connectivity of some special graphs.\nNext, we show that $1\\leq \\kappa_g(G)\\leq n-2g-2$ for $0\\leq g\\leq \\left\\lfloor\n\\frac{n-3}{2}\\right\\rfloor$, and graphs with $\\kappa_g(G)=1,2,3$ and trees with\n$\\kappa_g(T_n)=n-2g-2$ are characterized, respectively. In the end, we get the\nthree extremal results for the $g$-extra connectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Apr 2019 11:14:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

The technological challenge of the\nCGEM is related in its spatial limitation and the needed cylindrical shape.
