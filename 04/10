Local decodability in index coding improves the error\nperformance when used in wireless broadcast channels, reduces the receiver\ncomplexity and improves privacy in index coding. The 'locality' of an index\ncode is the ratio of the number of codeword symbols used by each receiver to\nthe number message symbols demanded by the receiver. Prior work on locality in\nindex coding have considered only single unicast and single-uniprior problems,\nand the optimal trade-off between broadcast rate and locality is known only for\na few cases. In this paper we identify the optimal broadcast rate (including\namong non-linear codes) for all three receiver unicast problems when the\nlocality is equal to the minimum possible value, i.e., equal to one. The index\ncode that achieves this optimal rate is based on a clique covering technique\nand is well known. The main contribution of this paper is in providing tight\nconverse results by relating locality to broadcast rate, and showing that this\nknown index coding scheme is optimal when locality is equal to one. Towards\nthis we derive several structural properties of the side information graphs of\nthree receiver unicast problems, and combine them with information theoretic\narguments to arrive at a converse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 16:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

The vast majority of such works leverages the\nstrengths of adversarial learning and deep convolutional autoencoders to\nachieve realistic results by well-capturing the target data distribution.\nNevertheless, the most prominent representatives of this class of methods do\nnot facilitate semantic structure in the latent space, and usually rely on\nbinary domain labels for test-time transfer. This leads to rigid models, unable\nto capture the variance of each domain label. In this light, we propose a novel\nadversarial learning method that (i) facilitates the emergence of latent\nstructure by semantically disentangling sources of variation, and (ii)\nencourages learning generalizable, continuous, and transferable latent codes\nthat enable flexible attribute mixing. This is achieved by introducing a novel\nloss function that encourages representations to result in uniformly\ndistributed class posteriors for disentangled attributes. In tandem with an\nalgorithm for inducing generalizable properties, the resulting representations\ncan be utilized for a variety of tasks such as intensity-preserving\nmulti-attribute image translation and synthesis, without requiring labelled\ntest data. We demonstrate the merits of the proposed method by a set of\nqualitative and quantitative experiments on popular databases such as MultiPIE,\nRaFD, and BU-3DFE, where our method outperforms other, state-of-the-art methods\nin tasks such as intensity-preserving multi-attribute transfer and synthesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 16:35:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 08:44:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2021 14:16:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

Additionally,\nmerging a sequential decision-making sub-task with question answering (QA)\nprovides a good setting for research in model calibration and opponent\nmodeling. Thus, embedded in this task are three machine learning challenges:\n(1) factoid QA over thousands of Wikipedia-like answers, (2) calibration of the\nQA model's confidence scores, and (3) sequential decision-making that\nincorporates knowledge of the QA model, its calibration, and what the opponent\nmay do.

Our method does not require any\nmulti-view image data, 3D skeletons, correspondences between 2D-3D points, or\nuse previously learned 3D priors during training. A lifting network accepts 2D\nlandmarks as inputs and generates a corresponding 3D skeleton estimate. During\ntraining, the recovered 3D skeleton is reprojected on random camera viewpoints\nto generate new \"synthetic\" 2D poses. By lifting the synthetic 2D poses back to\n3D and re-projecting them in the original camera view, we can define\nself-consistency loss both in 3D and in 2D. The training can thus be self\nsupervised by exploiting the geometric self-consistency of the\nlift-reproject-lift process. We show that self-consistency alone is not\nsufficient to generate realistic skeletons, however adding a 2D pose\ndiscriminator enables the lifter to output valid 3D poses. Additionally, to\nlearn from 2D poses \"in the wild\", we train an unsupervised 2D domain adapter\nnetwork to allow for an expansion of 2D data.

Dense material has also been detected\naround the Centaur Chiron, although its nature is debated. This is the first\ntime ever that rings are observed elsewhere than around the giant planets,\nsuggesting that those features are more common than previously thought. The\norigins of those rings remain unclear. In particular, it is not known if the\nsame generic process can explain the presence of material around Chariklo,\nChiron, Haumea, or if each object has a very different history. Nonetheless, a\nspecific aspect of small bodies is that they may possess a non-axisymmetric\nshape (topographic features and or elongation) that are essentially absent in\ngiant planets. This creates strong resonances between the spin rate of the\nobject and the mean motion of ring particles. In particular, Lindblad-type\nresonances tend to clear the region around the corotation (or synchronous)\norbit, where the particles orbital period matches that of the body. Whatever\nthe origin of the ring is, modest topographic features or elongations of\nChariklo and Haumea explain why their rings should be found beyond the\noutermost 1/2 resonance, where the particles complete one revolution while the\nbody completes two rotations. Comparison of the resonant locations relative to\nthe Roche limit of the body shows that fast rotators are favored for being\nsurrounded by rings.

In order to make this possible, it is necessary to define an\nobjective function that captures the problem at hand. Since the objective\nfunction will depend on the rotation and translation it is not possible to\nsolve it as a simple minimization problem. Hence the use of Alternating\nMinimization methods, in which the function will be alternatively minimized\nwith respect to the rotation and the translation.

This\nproblem is addressed by employing specific prediction models for the long-term\nendpoint which enable the incorporation of baseline covariates and multiple\nshort-term endpoints. We show that the proposed procedure leads to an\nefficiency gain and a reduced sample size, without compromising the Type I\nerror rate of the procedure, even when the adopted prediction models are\nmisspecified. In particular, implementing our proposal in the conditional power\napproach allows earlier decisions relative to standard approaches, whilst\ncontrolling the probability of an incorrect decision. This time gain results in\na lower expected number of recruited patients in case of stopping for futility,\nsuch that fewer patients receive the futile regimen. We explain how these\nmethods can be used in adaptive designs with unblinded sample size reassessment\nbased on the inverse normal $p$-value combination method to control type I\nerror. We support the proposal by Monte Carlo simulations based on data from a\nreal clinical trial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 19:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-11"}

The chemical abundance pattern\nof J0023+0307, with very low [Fe/Mg] and [Ca/Mg] abundance ratios, but\nrelatively high absolute Mg and Si abundances, suggests J0023+0307 is a second\ngeneration star formed from a molecular cloud polluted by only one supernova in\nwhich the fall-back mechanism played a role. We measure a carbon abundance of\nA(C)=6.2 that places J0023+0307 on the low band in the A(C)-[Fe/H] diagram,\nsuggesting no contamination from a binary companion. This star is also unique\nhaving a lithium abundance (A(Li)=2.02+-0.08) close to the level of the Lithium\nPlateau, in contrast with lower Li determinations or upper limits in all other\nextremely iron-poor stars. The upper envelope of the lithium abundances in\nunevolved stars spanning more than three orders of magnitude in metallicity\n(-6<[Fe/H]<-2.5) defines a nearly constant value. We argue that it is unlikely\nthat such uniformity is the result of depletion processes in stars from a\nsignificantly higher initial Li abundance, but suggests instead a lower\nprimordial production, pointing to new physics such as decaying massive\nparticles, varying fundamental constants, or nuclear resonances, that could\nhave affected the primordial 7Li production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 20:12:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

Normal traffic flow data, in the form of a host's ingress\nand egress bytes over time, is used to train an ensemble of one-class learners.\nThe detection ensemble is modular, with individual classifiers trained on\ndifferent traffic features thought to characterize malicious data transfers. We\nselect features that model the egress to ingress byte balance over time,\nperiodicity, short time-scale irregularity, and density of the traffic. The\nfeatures are most efficiently modeled in the frequency domain, which has the\nadded benefit that variable duration flows are transformed to a fixed-size\nfeature vector, and by sampling the frequency space appropriately,\nlong-duration flows can be tested. When trained on days- or weeks-worth of\ntraffic from individual hosts, our ensemble achieves a low false positive rate\n(<2%) on a range of different system types. Simulated exfiltration samples with\na variety of different timing and data characteristics were generated and used\nto test ensemble performance on different kinds of systems: when trained on a\nclient workstation's external traffic, the ensemble was generally successful at\ndetecting exfiltration that is not simultaneously ingress-heavy,\nconnection-sparse, and of short duration---a combination that is not optimal\nfor attackers seeking to transfer large amounts of data.

In conventional\nASR systems, several performance monitoring (PM) techniques have been\nwell-developed to monitor performance by looking at tri-phone posteriors or\npre-softmax activations from neural network acoustic modeling. However,\nstrategies for monitoring more recently developed end-to-end ASR systems have\nnot yet been explored, and so that is the focus of this paper. We adapt\nprevious PM measures (Entropy, M-measure and Auto-encoder) and apply our\nproposed RNN predictor in the end-to-end setting. These measures utilize the\ndecoder output layer and attention probability vectors, and their predictive\npower is measured with simple linear models. Our findings suggest that\ndecoder-level features are more feasible and informative than attention-level\nprobabilities for PM measures, and that M-measure on the decoder posteriors\nachieves the best overall predictive performance with an average prediction\nerror 8.8%.

This fact is recently used\nin [2] to generate random chordal graphs on $n$ vertices by generating $n$\nsubtrees of a tree on $n$ nodes. It follows that the space (and thus time)\ncomplexity of such an algorithm is at least the sum of the sizes of the\ngenerated subtrees assuming that a tree is given by a set of nodes. In [2],\nthis complexity was mistakenly claimed to be linear in the number $m$ of edges\nof the generated chordal graph. This error is corrected in [3] where the space\ncomplexity is shown to be $\\Omega(m n^{1/4})$. The exact complexity of the\nalgorithm is left as an open question.\n  In this paper, we show that the sum of the sizes of $n$ subtrees in a tree on\n$n$ nodes is $\\Theta(m\\sqrt{n})$. We also show that we can confine ourselves to\ncontraction-minimal subtree intersection representations since they are\nsufficient to generate every chordal graph. Furthermore, the sum of the sizes\nof the subtrees in such a representation is at most $2m+n$. We use this result\nto derive the first linear time random chordal graph generator. Based on\ncontraction-minimal representations, we also derive structural properties of\nchordal graphs related to their connectivity. In addition to these theoretical\nresults, we conduct experiments to study the quality of the chordal graphs\ngenerated by our algorithm and compare them to those in the literature. Our\nexperimental study indicates that the generated graphs do not have a restricted\nstructure and the sizes of maximal cliques are distributed fairly over the\nrange.

This critically\nprevents us from learning high fidelity face models which are needed to\nrepresent face images in high level of details. To address this problem, this\npaper presents a novel approach to learn additional proxies as means to\nside-step strong regularizations, as well as, leverages to promote detailed\nshape/albedo. To ease the learning, we also propose to use a dual-pathway\nnetwork, a carefully-designed architecture that brings a balance between global\nand local-based models. By improving the nonlinear 3D morphable model in both\nlearning objective and network architecture, we present a model which is\nsuperior in capturing higher level of details than the linear or its precedent\nnonlinear counterparts.

This paper presents imaging simulations of a\nnew Space VLBI mission concept. An initial design study of the concept has been\npresented as the Event Horizon Imager (EHI). The EHI may be suitable for\nimaging Sgr A* at high frequencies (up to ~690 GHz), which has significant\nadvantages over performing ground-based VLBI at 230 GHz. The concept EHI design\nconsists of two or three satellites in polar or equatorial circular\nMedium-Earth Orbits with slightly different radii. Due to the relative drift of\nthe satellites along the individual orbits, this setup will result in a dense\nspiral-shaped uv-coverage with long baselines (up to ~60 Glambda), allowing for\nextremely high-resolution and high-fidelity imaging of radio sources. We\nsimulate EHI observations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics models\nof Sgr A* and calculate the expected noise based on preliminary system\nparameters. On long baselines, where the signal-to-noise ratio may be low,\nfringes could be detected if the system is sufficiently phase stable and the\nsatellite orbits can be reconstructed with sufficient accuracy. Averaging\nvisibilities accumulated over multiple epochs of observations could then help\nimproving the image quality. With three satellites, closure phases could be\nused for imaging. Our simulations show that the EHI could be capable of imaging\nthe black hole shadow of Sgr A* with a resolution of 4 uas (about 8% of the\nshadow diameter) within several months of observing time. The EHI concept could\nthus be used to measure black hole shadows much more precisely than with\nground-based VLBI, allowing for stronger tests of general relativity and\naccretion models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 22:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

Our multiscale model is\nfounded upon a new compressible-incompressible decomposition of the velocity\nfield $u=v+w$.

This incompressible component $w$ of the velocity controls the small\nscale structures of the interface and can be solved efficiently on fine grids.\nMeanwhile, the compressible component of the velocity $v$ remains continuous\nnear contact discontinuities and can be computed on relatively coarse grids,\nwhile receiving subgrid scale information from $w$.

To reduce such a discrepancy, in this paper we propose a novel\nalgorithm to remove age-related components from features mixed with both\nidentity and age information. Specifically, we factorize a mixed face feature\ninto two uncorrelated components: identity-dependent component and\nage-dependent component, where the identity-dependent component includes\ninformation that is useful for face recognition. To implement this idea, we\npropose the Decorrelated Adversarial Learning (DAL) algorithm, where a\nCanonical Mapping Module (CMM) is introduced to find the maximum correlation\nbetween the paired features generated by a backbone network, while the backbone\nnetwork and the factorization module are trained to generate features reducing\nthe correlation. Thus, the proposed model learns the decomposed features of age\nand identity whose correlation is significantly reduced. Simultaneously, the\nidentity-dependent feature and the age-dependent feature are respectively\nsupervised by ID and age preserving signals to ensure that they both contain\nthe correct information.

The proposed model first leverages the full convolution\nnetwork (FCN) and pyramid pooling to extract spatial pyramid features. Then an\nalignment-free matching approach, namely Foreground-aware Pyramid\nReconstruction (FPR), is developed to accurately compute matching scores\nbetween occluded persons, despite their different scales and sizes.

An\nimportant component of the ACO system is the visual item counting, which\nrecognizes the categories and counts of the items chosen by the customers.\nHowever, the training of such a system is challenged by the domain adaptation\nproblem, in which the training data are images from isolated items while the\ntesting images are for collections of items. Existing methods solve this\nproblem with data augmentation using synthesized images, but the image\nsynthesis leads to unreal images that affect the training process. In this\npaper, we propose a new data priming method to solve the domain adaptation\nproblem. Specifically, we first use pre-augmentation data priming, in which we\nremove distracting background from the training images using the coarse-to-fine\nstrategy and select images with realistic view angles by the pose pruning\nmethod. In the post-augmentation step, we train a data priming network using\ndetection and counting collaborative learning, and select more reliable images\nfrom testing data to fine-tune the final visual item tallying network.\nExperiments on the large scale Retail Product Checkout (RPC) dataset\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, i.e., we achieve 80.51%\ncheckout accuracy compared with 56.68% of the baseline methods.

In this approach, five components are\ninvolved, including two teachers, two students and the desired spatiotemporal\nmodel. The knowledge of spatial and temporal saliency is first separately\ntransferred from the two complex and redundant teachers to their simple and\ncompact students, and the input scenes are also degraded from high-resolution\nto low-resolution to remove the probable data redundancy so as to greatly speed\nup the feature extraction process.

In this work, we propose a systematic method using very few\nlocal measurements to detect multipartite entanglement structures based on the\ngraph state --- one of the most important classes of quantum states for quantum\ninformation processing. Thanks to the close connection between the Schmidt\ncoefficient and quantum entropy in graph states, we develop a family of\nefficient witness operators to detect the entanglement between subsystems under\nany partitions and hence the entanglement intactness.

A node of a graph usually represents a real-world entity, e.g., a\nuser in a social network, or a protein in a protein-protein interaction\nnetwork. In this work, we consider a more challenging but practically useful\nsetting, in which a node itself is a graph instance. This leads to a\nhierarchical graph perspective which arises in many domains such as social\nnetwork, biological network and document collection. For example, in a social\nnetwork, a group of people with shared interests forms a user group, whereas a\nnumber of user groups are interconnected via interactions or common members. We\nstudy the node classification problem in the hierarchical graph where a `node'\nis a graph instance, e.g., a user group in the above example. As labels are\nusually limited in real-world data, we design two novel semi-supervised\nsolutions named \\underline{SE}mi-supervised gr\\underline{A}ph\nc\\underline{L}assification via \\underline{C}autious/\\underline{A}ctive\n\\underline{I}teration (or SEAL-C/AI in short). SEAL-C/AI adopt an iterative\nframework that takes turns to build or update two classifiers, one working at\nthe graph instance level and the other at the hierarchical graph level. To\nsimplify the representation of the hierarchical graph, we propose a novel\nsupervised, self-attentive graph embedding method called SAGE, which embeds\ngraph instances of arbitrary size into fixed-length vectors. Through\nexperiments on synthetic data and Tencent QQ group data, we demonstrate that\nSEAL-C/AI not only outperform competing methods by a significant margin in\nterms of accuracy/Macro-F1, but also generate meaningful interpretations of the\nlearned representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 04:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-11"}

This paper presents a logistic discriminant metric\nlearning method for this challenging problem. Different with most existing\nmetric learning algorithms, it exploits both original data and auxiliary data\nduring training, which is motivated by the new machine learning paradigm -\nLearning Using Privileged Information. Such privileged information is a kind of\nauxiliary knowledge which is only available during training. Our goal is to\nlearn an optimal distance function by constructing a locally adaptive decision\nrule with the help of privileged information. We jointly learn two distance\nmetrics by minimizing the empirical loss penalizing the difference between the\ndistance in the original space and that in the privileged space. In our\nsetting, the distance in the privileged space functions as a local decision\nthreshold, which guides the decision making in the original space like a\nteacher. The metric learned from the original space is used to compute the\ndistance between a probe image and a gallery image during testing. In addition,\nwe extend the proposed approach to a multi-view setting which is able to\nexplore the complementation of multiple feature representations. In the\nmulti-view setting, multiple metrics corresponding to different original\nfeatures are jointly learned, guided by the same privileged information.\nBesides, an effective iterative optimization scheme is introduced to\nsimultaneously optimize the metrics and the assigned metric weights. Experiment\nresults on several widely-used datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach\nis superior to global decision threshold based methods and outperforms most\nstate-of-the-art results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 05:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-11"}

Unfortunately, intelligent ransomware can easily bypass\nthese techniques. Another prevention technique is to recover from the backup\ncopy when a file is infected with ransomware. However, the data backup\ntechnique requires extra storage space and can be removed with ransomware. In\nthis paper, we propose to implement an access control mechanism on a disk\ndrive, called a KEY-SSD disk drive. KEY-SSD is the data store and the last\nbarrier to data protection. Unauthorized applications will not be able to read\nfile data even if they bypass the file system defense, thus denying the block\nrequest without knowing the disk's registered block key and completely\neliminating the possibility of the file becoming hostage to ransomware.

Previous works have succeeded in monocular\ndeblurring, yet there are few studies on deblurring for stereoscopic images. By\nexploiting the two-view nature of stereo images, we propose a novel stereo\nimage deblurring network with Depth Awareness and View Aggregation, named\nDAVANet. In our proposed network, 3D scene cues from the depth and varying\ninformation from two views are incorporated, which help to remove complex\nspatially-varying blur in dynamic scenes. Specifically, with our proposed\nfusion network, we integrate the bidirectional disparities estimation and\ndeblurring into a unified framework. Moreover, we present a large-scale\nmulti-scene dataset for stereo deblurring, containing 20,637 blurry-sharp\nstereo image pairs from 135 diverse sequences and their corresponding\nbidirectional disparities. The experimental results on our dataset demonstrate\nthat DAVANet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, speed,\nand model size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 08:47:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-11"}

Therefore, the experimental data can be quite messy due to the\nmixing of different modes, as well as the background noise, despite that each\nmode manifests itself as a single frequency oscillation. Here we develop an\nunsupervised machine learning algorithm to extract the frequencies of these\noscillations from such measurement data, that is, the eigenenergies of these\nmodes. This method is particularly useful when the measurement time is not long\nenough to perform the Fourier transformation. Our method is inspired by the\nindependent component analysis method and its application to the cocktail party\nproblem. In that problem, the goal is to recover each voice from detectors that\ndetect signals of many mixed voices, and the principle is to find out signals\nthat possess features and are away from a Gaussian distribution. Instead, our\ngeneralization is to find out signals that are close to a single frequency\noscillation.

Using previously developed theoretical approaches requires\ntime-consuming simulations that are impractical for many realistic tribological\nsystems. To solve this problem and set a framework for understanding\nmicroscopic mechanisms of friction at interfaces including multiple microscopic\ncontacts, we developed an analytical approach for description of friction\nmediated by dynamical formation and rupture of microscopic interfacial\ncontacts, which allows to calculate frictional properties on the time and\nlength scales that are relevant to tribological experimental conditions.

Performance evaluation as well as auditory analysis of\nsinging, whether individually or in a choir, often depend on extracting f0\ncontours for the singing voice. However, due to the large number of singers,\nsinging at a similar frequency range, extracting the exact individual pitch\ncontours from choir recordings is a challenging task. In this paper, we address\nthis task and develop a methodology for modeling pitch contours of SATB choir\nrecordings. A typical SATB choir consists of four parts, each covering a\ndistinct range of pitches and often with multiple singers each. We first\nevaluate some state-of-the-art multi-f0 estimation systems for the particular\ncase of choirs with a single singer per part, and observe that the pitch of\nindividual singers can be estimated to a relatively high degree of accuracy. We\nobserve, however, that the scenario of multiple singers for each choir part\n(i.e. unison singing) is far more challenging. In this work we propose a\nmethodology based on combining a multi-f0 estimation methodology based on deep\nlearning followed by a set of traditional DSP techniques to model f0 and its\ndispersion instead of a single f0 trajectory for each choir part.

For massive stars, rapid rotation\ncombines with their strong radiation-driven wind. The aim of this paper is to\ninvestigate two questions that are prerequisite to the study of the evolution\nof massive rapidly rotating stars: (i) What is the critical angular velocity of\na star when radiative acceleration is significant in its atmosphere? (ii) How\ndo mass and angular momentum loss depend on the rotation rate? To investigate\nfast rotation, which makes stars oblate, we used the 2D ESTER models and a\nsimplified approach, the $\\omega$-model, which gives the latitudinal dependence\nof the radiative flux in a centrifugally flattened radiative envelope. We find\nthat radiative acceleration only mildly influences the critical angular\nvelocity, at least for stars with masses lower than 40 Msun. We explain this\nmild reduction of the critical angular velocity compared to the classical\nKeplerian angular velocity by the combined effects of gravity darkening and a\nreduced equatorial opacity that is due to the centrifugal acceleration. To\nanswer the second question, we first devised a model of the local surface mass\nflux, which we calibrated with previously developed 1D models. The\ndiscontinuity (the so-called bi-stability jump) included in the $\\dot{M}-T_{\\rm\neff}$ relation of 1D models means that the mass flux of a fast-rotating star is\ncontrolled by either a single wind or a two-wind regime. Mass and angular\nmomentum losses are strong around the equator if the star is in the two-wind\nregime. We also show that the difficulty of selecting massive stars that are\nviewed pole-on makes detecting the discontinuity in the relation between mass\nloss and effective temperature also quite challenging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 09:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

This new system\npresents a solution for the drawbacks found in the current quadrotor\nmanipulation system which uses a gripper fixed to a quadrotor. Unlike the\ncurrent system, the proposed system has a 6-DOF, and it provides enough\ndistance between the quadrotor and the object. System kinematics and dynamics\nare derived. To study the feasibility of the proposed system, a quadrotor with\nhigh enough payload to add the 2-link manipulator is constructed. Its\nparameters are identified to be used in the simulation and controller design. A\nCAD model is developed to calculate the mass and moments of inertia in an\naccurate way. Direct relationships between Pulse Width Modulation and each of\nthe angular speeds, thrust forces, and drag moments of the rotors are\nidentified. A Direction Cosine Matrix complementary filter is used to estimate\nthe attitude of the quadrotor using the IMU measurements. Attitude\nstabilization controller is designed based on feedback linearization technique\nto test the identified parameters and the attitude estimation. The results of\nthe experiments show satisfactory accuracy of the identified structure\nparameters, the identified rotor assembly parameters, and the attitude\nestimation algorithm. A controller for the proposed system is designed based on\nthree control techniques: feedback linearization based PID control, direct\nfuzzy logic control, and fuzzy model reference learning control. These\ncontrollers are tested to provide system stability and trajectory tracking\nunder the effect of picking and placing a payload and the effect of changing\nthe operating region. Simulation results show that the fuzzy model reference\nlearning control technique has superior performance.

However, they always emphasize on result-oriented\nlearning while neglecting the scheme of process-oriented learning, leading to\nthe loss of rich information contained in the whole network pipeline. Inspired\nby the assumption that, the small network can not perfectly mimic a large one\ndue to the huge gap of network scale, we propose a knowledge transfer method,\ninvolving effective intermediate supervision, under the adversarial training\nframework to learn the student network. To achieve powerful but highly compact\nintermediate information representation, the squeezed knowledge is realized by\ntask-driven attention mechanism. Then, the transferred knowledge from teacher\nnetwork could accommodate the size of student network. As a result, the\nproposed method integrates merits from both process-oriented and\nresult-oriented learning. Extensive experimental results on three typical\nbenchmark datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that\nour method achieves highly superior performances against other state-of-the-art\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 10:42:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 07:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-26"}

The main challenge in such procedures is the updating of a prior\nensemble to a posterior ensemble at every step of the filtering recursions. In\nthe famous ensemble Kalman filter, the assumption of a linear-Gaussian state\nspace model is introduced in order to overcome this issue, and the prior\nensemble is updated with a linear shift closely related to the traditional\nKalman filter equations. In the current article, we consider how the ideas\nunderlying the ensemble Kalman filter can be applied when the components of the\nstate vectors are binary variables. While the ensemble Kalman filter relies on\nGaussian approximations of the forecast and filtering distributions, we instead\nuse first order Markov chains. To update the prior ensemble, we simulate\nsamples from a distribution constructed such that the expected number of equal\ncomponents in a prior and posterior state vector is maximised.

In this paper we compute the growth rate of this instability for two\ntypes of the electron distribution: a) for the power-law distribution and b)\nfor the kappa distribution, in the both cases with the loss-cone type\nanisotropy. We found that the growth rate of the upper-hybrid waves for the\npower-law momentum distribution strongly depends on the pitch-angle boundary.\nThe maximum growth rate was found for the pitch-angle $\\theta_\\mathrm{c}\n\\approx$ 50$^\\circ$. For small angles the growth rate profile is very flat and\nfor high pitch-angles the wave absorption occurs. Furthermore, analyzing the\ngrowth rate of the upper hybrid waves for the kappa momentum distribution we\nfound that a decrease of the characteristic momentum $p_\\kappa$ shifts the\nmaximum of the growth rate to lower values of the ratio of the electron-plasma\nand electron-cyclotron frequencies, and the frequency widths of the growth rate\npeaks are very broad. But, if we consider the kappa distribution which is\nisotropic up to some large momentum $p_m$ and anisotropic with loss-cone above\nthis momentum then distinct peaks of the growth rate appear and thus distinct\nzebra stripes can be generated. It means that the restriction for small momenta\nfor the anisotropic part of distributions is of principal importance for the\nzebra stripes generation. Finally, for the 1 August 2010 zebra stripes, the\ngrowth rates in dependence on radio frequency were computed. It was shown that\nin this case the growth rate peaks are more distinct than in usually presented\ndependencies of growth rates on the ratio of the plasma and cyclotron\nfrequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 11:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-11"}

Using first atomistic Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for\na model with Heisenberg spins on a cylindrical surface, we compute hysteresis\nloops for a wide range of the $\\gamma=D/J$ parameter, characterizing the\nreversal behavior in terms of the cylindrical magnetization components and the\nvorticity parameter along the tube length. For $\\gamma$'s close to the value\nfor which helical (H) states are stable at zero applied field, we show that the\nhysteresis loops can occur in four different classes that are combinations of\ntwo reversal modes with well-differentiated coercivities with probabilities\nthat depend on the tube length and radius. This variety in the reversal modes\nis found to be linked to the metastability of the $H$ states during the\nreversal that induce different paths followed along the energy landscape as the\nfield is changed. We further demonstrate that reversal by either of the two\nmodes can be induced by tailoring the nanotube initial state so that vortices\nwith equal or contrary chirality are formed at the ends, thus achieving low or\nhigh coercive fields at will without changing $\\gamma$. Finally, the results of\nadditional micromagnetic simulations performed on tubes with similar aspect\nratio show that dual switching modes and its tailoring can also be observed in\ntubes with more microscopic dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 11:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

We also consider $f_1(1285)$\naxial-vector-meson, ($\\pi,\\eta$) pseudoscalar-meson, and ($a_0,f_0$)\nscalar-meson exchanges in the $t$ channel, in addition to the experimentally\nconfirmed nucleon resonances, such as $N^*(2000,5/2^+)$ and $N^*(2300,1/2^+)$,\nfor the direct $\\phi$-meson radiations in the $s$ and $u$ channels. We provide\nnumerical results for the total and differential cross sections as well as the\nspin-density matrices in the Gottfried-Jackson, Adair, and helicity frames. We\nobserve that, together with the universally accepted pomeron contribution, the\nconsidered meson and nucleon-resonance contributions play significant roles in\nreproducing the experimental data for the forward and backward $\\phi$-meson\nscattering-angle regions, respectively, indicating the nontrivial interferences\nbetween mesonic and baryonic contributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 12:23:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jul 2019 04:42:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 11:09:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

Raman Spectroscopy was\nemployed to identify experimentally the critical strain to failure of the\ngraphitic specimens. The most striking finding is that, contrary to what would\nbe expected from Eulerian mechanics, the critical compressive strain to failure\ndecreases with increase of flake thickness. This is due to the layered\nstructure of the material and in particular the weak cohesive forces that hold\nthe layers together. The plate phenomenology breaks down for the case of\nmulti-layer graphene, which can be approached as discrete single layers weakly\nbonded to each other.

LANET is intended to support\nscenarios requiring dense deployment and high data rates. In Visible Light\nCommunication (VLC), most of the attention has been centered around physical\nlayer with emphasis on point-to-point communication. In this work, we focus on\ndesigning a routing protocol specifically to overcome the unique challenges\nlike blockage and deafness that render routes in LANETs highly unstable.\nTherefore, we propose a cross-layer optimized routing protocol (VL-ROUTE) that\ninteracts closely with the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer to maximize the\nthroughput of the network by taking into account the reliability of routes.\n  To accomplish this in a distributed manner, we carefully formulate a Route\nReliability Score (RRS) that can be computed by each node in the network using\njust the information gathered from its immediate neighbors. Each node computes\nan RRS for every known sink in the network. RRS of a given node can be\nconsidered as an estimate of the probability of reaching a given sink via that\nnode. The RSS value is then integrated to the utility based three-way handshake\nprocess used by the MAC protocol (VL-MAC) to mitigate the effects of deafness,\nblockage, hidden node, and maximize the probability of establishing full-duplex\nlinks. All these factors contribute towards maximizing the network throughput.\nExtensive simulation of VL-ROUTE shows 124% improvement in network throughput\nover a network that uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance\n(CSMA/CA) along with shortest path routing. Additionally, VL-ROUTE also showed\nup to 21% improvement in throughput over the network that uses VL-MAC along\nwith a geographic routing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 13:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-11"}

We have identified two main classes of GCs:\nType I (~83% of the objects) and Type II, both hosting two main groups of\nstars, referred to in this series as first (1G) and second generation (2G).\nType II clusters exhibit two or more parallel sequences of 1G and 2G stars in\ntheir ChMs. We exploit elemental abundances from literature to assign the\nchemical composition to the distinct populations as identified on the ChMs of\n29 GCs. We find that stars in different regions of the ChM have different\ncomposition: 1G stars share the same light-element content as field stars,\nwhile 2G stars are enhanced in N, Na and depleted in O. Stars enhanced in Al\nand depleted in Mg populate the extreme regions of the ChM.

Due to co-existing electron and hole pockets, the density of states\nat the Fermi energy becomes finite, leading to a significant enhancement of\nKondo effect. Consequently, the magnetic impurity and the conduction electrons\nalways form a bound state, this behavior is distinct from that in the type-I\nWSMs, where the bound state is only formed when the hybridization exceeds a\ncritical value. Meanwhile, the spin-orbit coupling and unique geometry of the\nFermi surface lead to strongly anisotropic Kondo screening cloud in coordinate\nspace.

In this paper,\nwe aim to clarify the rotational evolution of rapidly rotating early-type stars\nalong the main sequence (MS). We have used the 2D ESTER code to compute and\nevolve isolated rapidly rotating early-type stellar models along the MS, with\nand without anisotropic mass loss. We show that stars with $Z=0.02$ and masses\nbetween $5$ and $7~M_\\odot$ reach criticality during the main sequence provided\ntheir initial angular velocity is larger than 50% of the Keplerian one. More\nmassive stars are subject to radiation-driven winds and to an associated loss\nof mass and angular momentum. We find that this angular momentum extraction\nfrom the outer layers can prevent massive stars from reaching critical rotation\nand greatly reduce the degree of criticality at the end of the MS. Our model\nincludes the so-called bi-stability jump of the $\\dot{M}-T_{\\rm eff}$ relation\nof 1D-models. This discontinuity now shows up in the latitude variations of the\nmass-flux surface density, endowing rotating massive stars with either a\nsingle-wind regime (no discontinuity) or a two-wind regime (a discontinuity).\nIn the two-winds-regime, mass loss and angular momentum loss are strongly\nincreased at low latitudes inducing a faster slow-down of the rotation.\nHowever, predicting the rotational fate of a massive star is difficult, mainly\nbecause of the non-linearity of the phenomena involved and their strong\ndependence on uncertain prescriptions. Moreover, the very existence of the\nbi-stability jump in mass-loss rate remains to be substantiated by\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 14:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

By a result on the tensor rank of Kruskal from the 1970s, the tensor\nrank of a rank-metric code of dimension $k$ and minimum rank distance $d$ is at\nleast $k+d-1$. We call codes that meet this bound minimal tensor rank (MTR)\ncodes. It is known from results in algebraic complexity theory that an MTR code\nimplies the existence of an MDS code. In this paper, we also address the\nconverse problem, that of the existence of an MTR code, given an MDS code. We\nidentify several parameters for which the converse holds and give explicit\nconstructions of MTR codes using MDS codes. We furthermore define generalized\ntensor ranks, which give a refinement of the tensor rank as a code invariant.\nMoreover, we use these to distinguish inequivalent rank-metric codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 14:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-11"}

The particles\nreleased at a source, which is maintained at a constant density, execute\nunbiased random walks over a lattice; it represents solute infiltration by\ndiffusion into a medium in contact with a reservoir. A scaling approach shows\nthat the infiltrated length, area, or volume evolves in time as the number of\ndistinct sites visited by a single random walker in the same medium. This is\nconsistent with simulations of the lattice model and exact and numerical\nsolutions of the corresponding diffusion equation. In a Sierpinski carpet, the\ninfiltrated area is expected to evolve as t^{D_F/D_W} (Alexander-Orbach\nrelation), where D_F is the fractal dimension of the medium and D_W is the\nrandom walk dimension; the numerical integration of the diffusion equation\nsupports this relation and improves results of lattice random walk simulations.\nIn a Menger sponge in which D_F>D_W (a fractal with a dimension close to 3), a\nlinear time increase of the infiltrated volume is predicted and confirmed\nnumerically. Thus, no evidence of fractality can be observed in infiltrated\nvolumes or masses in media where random walks are not recurrent, although the\ntracer diffusion is anomalous. We compare our results with a fluid infiltration\nmodel in which the pressure head is constant at the source and the front\ndisplacement is driven by the local gradient of that head. Exact or numerical\nsolutions in two and three dimensions and in a carpet show that this type of\nfluid infiltration is in the same universality class of RWI, with an\nequivalence between the head and the particle concentration. These results set\na relation between different infiltration processes with localized sources and\nthe recurrence properties of random walks in the same media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 15:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-11"}

One of its main features is that voters\ncan delegate their votes in a transitive manner such that: A delegates to B and\nB delegates to C leads to A indirectly delegates to C. These delegations can be\neffectively empowered by implementing liquid democracy in a social network, so\nthat voters can delegate their votes to any of their neighbors in the network.\nHowever, it is uncertain that such a delegation process will lead to a stable\nstate where all voters are satisfied with the people representing them. We\nstudy the stability (w.r.t. voters preferences) of the delegation process in\nliquid democracy and model it as a game in which the players are the voters and\nthe strategies are their possible delegations. We answer several questions on\nthe equilibria of this process in any social network or in social networks that\ncorrespond to restricted types of graphs.\n  We show that a Nash-equilibrium may not exist, and that it is even\nNP-complete to decide whether one exists or not. This holds even if the social\nnetwork is a complete graph or a bounded degree graph. We further show that\nthis existence problem is W[1]-hard w.r.t. the treewidth of the social network.\nBesides these hardness results, we demonstrate that an equilibrium always\nexists whatever the preferences of the voters iff the social network is a tree.\nWe design a dynamic programming procedure to determine some desirable\nequilibria (e.g., minimizing the dissatisfaction of the voters) in polynomial\ntime for tree social networks. Lastly, we study the convergence of delegation\ndynamics. Unfortunately, when an equilibrium exists, we show that a best\nresponse dynamics may not converge, even if the social network is a path or a\ncomplete graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 15:03:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 11:47:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-20"}

With the recent technological improvement of automated\nvehicles, it is expected that automated demand responsive transit and automated\ndemand responsive feeder transit potentially will be options to improve\nmobility in rural areas. One of the main concerns for the optimal automated\ndemand responsive feeder transit operation is variation of passenger demand.\nObviously, changes in passenger demand should alter the optimal operation and\nwill result in different passenger travel times and vehicle operation costs.\nThis paper uses the optimal feeder bus routing algorithm previously developed\nby the authors. With it, the effects of the various passenger demands with\nfixed fleet size will be evaluated for the optimal automated demand responsive\nfeeder bus operation based on the example network. The results show that when\ndemand goes up, the maximum average used capacity of vehicles goes up as\nexpected. Moreover, when demand goes up, transit service becomes more\ncircuitous and makes the passenger costs/person and total costs/person\nincrease, and the service becomes less efficient, although operating\ncosts/passenger decreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 17:15:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

Encoding the\ncorrelations between the elementary constituents of the nucleon, GPDs allow a\n3-dimensional imaging of the nucleon from the dynamical link between the\ntransverse position and the longitudinal momentum of partons. Double Deeply\nVirtual Compton Scattering (DDVCS) corresponds to the scattering from the\nnucleon of a virtual photon that finally generates a lepton pair, where the\nfinal leptons can be either an electron or a muon pair. The virtuality of the\nfinal photon allows to investigate in a decorrelated way the initial and\ntransferred momentum dependences of the GPDs. This unique feature of DDVCS is\nof relevance, among others, for the determination of the transverse parton\ndensities and the distribution of nuclear forces. This proceeding discusses\npreliminary model-predicted DDVCS experimental projections at JLab12 and\nindicates the impact of potential DDVCS experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 13:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-16"}

However, research based on Fuzzy Multi-Attribute Decision Making\n(F-MADM) approach in ranking resilient suppliers in logistic 4 is still in its\ninfancy. Traditional MADM approach fails to address the resilient supplier\nselection problem in logistic 4 primarily because of the large amount of data\nconcerning some attributes that are quantitative, yet difficult to process\nwhile making decisions. Besides, some qualitative attributes prevalent in\nlogistic 4 entail imprecise perceptual or judgmental decision relevant\ninformation, and are substantially different than those considered in\ntraditional suppler selection problems. This study develops a Decision Support\nSystem (DSS) that will help the decision maker to incorporate and process such\nimprecise heterogeneous data in a unified framework to rank a set of resilient\nsuppliers in the logistic 4 environment. The proposed framework induces a\ntriangular fuzzy number from large-scale temporal data using\nprobability-possibility consistency principle. Large number of non-temporal\ndata presented graphically are computed by extracting granular information that\nare imprecise in nature. Fuzzy linguistic variables are used to map the\nqualitative attributes. Finally, fuzzy based TOPSIS method is adopted to\ngenerate the ranking score of alternative suppliers. These ranking scores are\nused as input in a Multi-Choice Goal Programming (MCGP) model to determine\noptimal order allocation for respective suppliers. Finally, a sensitivity\nanalysis assesses how the Suppliers Cost versus Resilience Index (SCRI) changes\nwhen differential priorities are set for respective cost and resilience\nattributes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 03:33:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 21:18:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 2019 04:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}

Integrated information has been introduced as a metric to quantify the\namount of information generated by a system beyond the information generated by\nits elements. Yet, this intriguing notion comes with the price of being\nprohibitively expensive to calculate, since the calculations require an\nexponential number of sub-divisions of a system. Here we introduce a novel\nframework to connect algorithmic randomness and integrated information and a\nnumerical method for estimating integrated information using a perturbation\ntest rooted in algorithmic information dynamics. This method quantifies the\nchange in program size of a system when subjected to a perturbation. The\nintuition behind is that if an object is random then random perturbations have\nlittle to no effect to what happens when a shorter program but when an object\nhas the ability to move in both directions (towards or away from randomness) it\nwill be shown to be better integrated as a measure of sophistication telling\napart randomness and simplicity from structure. We show that an object with a\nhigh integrated information value is also more compressible, and is, therefore,\nmore sensitive to perturbations. We find that such a perturbation test\nquantifying compression sensitivity provides a system with a means to extract\nexplanations--causal accounts--of its own behaviour. Our technique can reduce\nthe number of calculations to arrive at some bounds or estimations, as the\nalgorithmic perturbation test guides an efficient search for estimating\nintegrated information. Our work sets the stage for a systematic exploration of\nconnections between algorithmic complexity and integrated information at the\nlevel of both theory and practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 2019 18:05:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 2019 19:29:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}
