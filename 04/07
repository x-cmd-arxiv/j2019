The ReLPV block extracts the phase in a\n3D local neighborhood (e.g., 3x3x3) of each position of the input map to obtain\nthe feature maps. The phase is extracted by computing 3D Short Term Fourier\nTransform (STFT) at multiple fixed low frequency points in the 3D local\nneighborhood of each position.

We describe a class of stochastic\nsystems composed of unidirectional links forming cycles and detailed-balanced\nbidirectional links, showing that they behave in a pseudo-deterministic\nfashion. This approach is applied to a system with time-dependent stochastic\nresetting. Our framework is consistent with thermodynamics and leads to some\nintriguing observations on the relation between the arrow of time and the\naverage entropy production for resetting events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Apr 2019 17:27:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 09:35:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

If $G$ is a finite graph covered by $X$, it is\nsaid to be $X$-Ramanujan if its second-largest eigenvalue $\\lambda_2(G)$ is at\nmost the spectral radius $\\rho(X)$ of $X$, and more generally\n$k$-quasi-$X$-Ramanujan if $\\lambda_k(G)$ is at most $\\rho(X)$. In case $X$ is\nthe infinite $\\Delta$-regular tree, this reduces to the well known notion of a\nfinite $\\Delta$-regular graph being Ramanujan. Inspired by the Interlacing\nPolynomials method of Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava, we show the existence\nof infinitely many $k$-quasi-$X$-Ramanujan graphs for a variety of infinite\n$X$. In particular, $X$ need not be a tree; our analysis is applicable whenever\n$X$ is what we call an additive product graph. This additive product is a new\nconstruction of an infinite graph $\\mathsf{AddProd}(A_1, \\dots, A_c)$ from\nfinite 'atom' graphs $A_1, \\dots, A_c$ over a common vertex set. It generalizes\nthe notion of the free product graph $A_1 * \\cdots * A_c$ when the atoms $A_j$\nare vertex-transitive, and it generalizes the notion of the universal covering\ntree when the atoms $A_j$ are single-edge graphs. Key to our analysis is a new\ngraph polynomial $\\alpha(A_1, \\dots, A_c;x)$ that we call the additive\ncharacteristic polynomial. It generalizes the well known matching polynomial\n$\\mu(G;x)$ in case the atoms $A_j$ are the single edges of $G$, and it\ngeneralizes the $r$-characteristic polynomial introduced in [Ravichandran'16,\nLeake-Ravichandran'18].

However, to date, such systems are not precise enough when types\ndepend on values, which often arises when using certain Ruby libraries. For\nexample, the type safety of a database query in Ruby on Rails depends on the\ntable and column names used in the query. To address this issue, we introduce\nCompRDL, a type system for Ruby that allows library method type signatures to\ninclude type-level computations (or comp types for short). Combined with\nsingleton types for table and column names, comp types let us give database\nquery methods type signatures that compute a table's schema to yield very\nprecise type information. Comp types for hash, array, and string libraries can\nalso increase precision and thereby reduce the need for type casts. We\nformalize CompRDL and prove its type system sound. Rather than type check the\nbodies of library methods with comp types---those methods may include native\ncode or be complex---CompRDL inserts run-time checks to ensure library methods\nabide by their computed types. We evaluated CompRDL by writing annotations with\ntype-level computations for several Ruby core libraries and database query\nAPIs. We then used those annotations to type check two popular Ruby libraries\nand four Ruby on Rails web apps. We found the annotations were relatively\ncompact and could successfully type check 132 methods across our subject\nprograms. Moreover, the use of type-level computations allowed us to check more\nexpressive properties, with fewer manually inserted casts, than was possible\nwithout type-level computations. In the process, we found two type errors and a\ndocumentation error that were confirmed by the developers. Thus, we believe\nCompRDL is an important step forward in bringing precise static type checking\nto dynamic languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Apr 2019 20:06:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

A practically\nuseful malware classifier must be robust against evasion attacks. However,\nachieving such robustness is an extremely challenging task.\n  In this paper, we take the first steps towards training robust PDF malware\nclassifiers with verifiable robustness properties. For instance, a robustness\nproperty can enforce that no matter how many pages from benign documents are\ninserted into a PDF malware, the classifier must still classify it as\nmalicious. We demonstrate how the worst-case behavior of a malware classifier\nwith respect to specific robustness properties can be formally verified.\nFurthermore, we find that training classifiers that satisfy formally verified\nrobustness properties can increase the evasion cost of unbounded (i.e., not\nbounded by the robustness properties) attackers by eliminating simple evasion\nattacks.\n  Specifically, we propose a new distance metric that operates on the PDF tree\nstructure and specify two classes of robustness properties including subtree\ninsertions and deletions. We utilize state-of-the-art verifiably robust\ntraining method to build robust PDF malware classifiers. Our results show that,\nwe can achieve 92.27% average verified robust accuracy over three properties,\nwhile maintaining 99.74% accuracy and 0.56% false positive rate.

In this paper, we propose\na new learning-based hashing method called ``fast supervised discrete hashing\"\n(FSDH) based on ``supervised discrete hashing\" (SDH). Regressing the training\nexamples (or hash code) to the corresponding class labels is widely used in\nordinary least squares regression. Rather than adopting this method, FSDH uses\na very simple yet effective regression of the class labels of training examples\nto the corresponding hash code to accelerate the algorithm. To the best of our\nknowledge, this strategy has not previously been used for hashing. Traditional\nSDH decomposes the optimization into three sub-problems, with the most critical\nsub-problem - discrete optimization for binary hash codes - solved using\niterative discrete cyclic coordinate descent (DCC), which is time-consuming.\nHowever, FSDH has a closed-form solution and only requires a single rather than\niterative hash code-solving step, which is highly efficient. Furthermore, FSDH\nis usually faster than SDH for solving the projection matrix for least squares\nregression, making FSDH generally faster than SDH. For example, our results\nshow that FSDH is about 12-times faster than SDH when the number of hashing\nbits is 128 on the CIFAR-10 data base, and FSDH is about 151-times faster than\nFastHash when the number of hashing bits is 64 on the MNIST data-base.

While previous efforts address the problem by designing\nnovel self-supervised tasks using video data, the learned features are merely\non a frame-by-frame basis, which are not applicable to many video analytic\ntasks where spatio-temporal features are prevailing. In this paper we propose a\nnovel self-supervised approach to learn spatio-temporal features for video\nrepresentation. Inspired by the success of two-stream approaches in video\nclassification, we propose to learn visual features by regressing both motion\nand appearance statistics along spatial and temporal dimensions, given only the\ninput video data. Specifically, we extract statistical concepts (fast-motion\nregion and the corresponding dominant direction, spatio-temporal color\ndiversity, dominant color, etc.) from simple patterns in both spatial and\ntemporal domains. Unlike prior puzzles that are even hard for humans to solve,\nthe proposed approach is consistent with human inherent visual habits and\ntherefore easy to answer. We conduct extensive experiments with C3D to validate\nthe effectiveness of our proposed approach.

In general, the MAP transaction arrivals\nand the two stages of PH service times make our blockchain queue more suitable\nto various practical conditions of blockchain systems with crucial random\nfactors, for example, the mining processes, the block-generations, the\nblockchain-building and so forth. For such a more general blockchain queueing\nmodel, we focus on two basic research aspects: (1) By using the\nmatrix-geometric solution, we first obtain a sufficient stable condition of the\nblockchain system.

The prediction procedure\nshould yield accurate results in a fast enough fashion to alert patients of\nimpending seizures. Methods: We quantitatively analyze the human iEEG data to\nobtain insights into how the human brain behaves before and between epileptic\nseizures. We then introduce an efficient pre-processing method for reducing the\ndata size and converting the time-series iEEG data into an image-like format\nthat can be used as inputs to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Further, we\npropose a seizure prediction algorithm that uses cooperative multi-scale CNNs\nfor automatic feature learning of iEEG data. Results: 1) iEEG channels contain\ncomplementary information and excluding individual channels is not advisable to\nretain the spatial information needed for accurate prediction of epileptic\nseizures. 2) The traditional PCA is not a reliable method for iEEG data\nreduction in seizure prediction. 3) Hand-crafted iEEG features may not be\nsuitable for reliable seizure prediction performance as the iEEG data varies\nbetween patients and over time for the same patient. 4) Seizure prediction\nresults show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods by achieving an\naverage sensitivity of 87.85% and AUC score of 0.84.

FRN consists of an autoencoder with residual\nblock-embedded skip-connections and incorporates facial attribute vectors into\nthe feature maps of input portraits at the bottleneck of the autoencoder. DN\nhas multiple convolutional and fully-connected layers, and its role is to\nenforce FRN to generate authentic face images with corresponding facial\nattributes dictated by the input attribute vectors. %Leveraging on the spatial\ntransformer networks, FRN automatically compensates for misalignments of\nportraits. % and generates aligned face images.

To address the former, this study\nextends several VB methods for MMNL to admit utility specifications including\nboth fixed and random utility parameters. To address the latter, we conduct an\nextensive simulation-based evaluation to benchmark the extended VB methods\nagainst MCMC and MSLE in terms of estimation times, parameter recovery and\npredictive accuracy. The results suggest that all VB variants with the\nexception of the ones relying on an alternative variational lower bound\nconstructed with the help of the modified Jensen's inequality perform as well\nas MCMC and MSLE at prediction and parameter recovery. In particular, VB with\nnonconjugate variational message passing and the delta-method (VB-NCVMP-Delta)\nis up to 16 times faster than MCMC and MSLE.

The requirements for\nRRAM are therefore a lot less stringent for BNNs than more traditional\napplications.

The\ninherent exploration of learning approaches can lead to instabilities and the\nrobot reaching joint limits at high speeds. Having hardware that enables safe\nexploration of high-speed and high-acceleration movements is therefore\ndesirable. To address this issue, we propose to use robots actuated by\nPneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAMs). In this paper, we present a four degrees\nof freedom (DoFs) robot arm that reaches high joint angle accelerations of up\nto 28000 deg/s^2 while avoiding dangerous joint limits thanks to the\nantagonistic actuation and limits on the air pressure ranges. With this robot\narm, we are able to tune control parameters using Bayesian optimization\ndirectly on the hardware without additional safety considerations. The achieved\ntracking performance on a fast trajectory exceeds previous results on\ncomparable PAM-driven robots. We also show that our system can be controlled\nwell on slow trajectories with PID controllers due to careful construction\nconsiderations such as minimal bending of cables, lightweight kinematics and\nminimal contact between PAMs and PAMs with the links. Finally, we propose a\nnovel technique to control the the co-contraction of antagonistic muscle pairs.\nExperimental results illustrate that choosing the optimal co-contraction level\nis vital to reach better tracking performance. Through the use of PAM-driven\nrobots and learning, we do a small step towards the future development of\nrobots capable of more human-like motions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 2019 15:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

We build on recent advances in the field of data-driven\ndiscovery and control of complex systems and combine it with classical work on\nmodified differential equation analysis of Warming, Hyett, Lerat and Peyret.

This work investigates the superconductivity of monolayer\nNbSe2 in CDW phase using the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg formalism based on\nfirst principles calculations. The mechanism of the competition between and\ncoexistence of the superconductivity and CDW is studied in detail by analyzing\nEPC.

Recent experiment indicates that there is transitioning from regular\nsuperconductivity in thin-film NbSe2 to two-gap superconductivity in the bulk,\nwhich is shown here to have its origin in the extent of Fermi surface gapping\nof K and K' pockets induced by CDW.

Our SRN,\ncomposed of an autoencoder with residual block-embedded skip connections, is\ndesigned to transfer feature maps of stylized images to the feature maps of the\ncorresponding photorealistic faces. Owing to the Spatial Transformer Network\n(STN), SRN automatically compensates for misalignments of stylized portraits to\noutput aligned realistic face images.

For example, the swimming of bacteria and spermatozoa as\nwell as important physiological functions at organ-level, such as the\ncilia-induced motion of mucus in the lungs, or individual cell-level, such as\nactin filaments or microtubules, all employ flexible filaments moving in\nviscous fluids. As a result of fluid-structure interactions, a variety of\nnonlinear phenomena may arise in the dynamics of such moving flexible\nfilaments. In this paper we derive the mathematical tools required to study\nfilament-driven propulsion in the asymptotic limit of stiff filaments. Motion\nin the rigid limit leads to hydrodynamic loads which deform the filament and\nimpact the filament propulsion. We first derive the general mathematical\nformulation and then apply it to the case of a helical filament, a situation\nrelevant for the swimming of flagellated bacteria and for the transport of\nartificial, magnetically actuated motors. We find that, as a result of\nflexibility, the helical filament is either stretched or compressed (conforming\nprevious studies) and its axis also bends, a new result which we interpret\nphysically. We then explore and interpret the dependence of the perturbed\npropulsion speed due to the deformation on the relevant dimensionless dynamic\nand geometric parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Apr 2019 18:23:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

Specifically, we (i) gain insight into the crack growth\nresistance of FGMs by conducting numerical experiments over a wide range of\nmaterial gradation profiles and orientations, (ii) accurately reproduce the\ncrack trajectories observed in graded photodegradable copolymers and\nglass-filled epoxy FGMs, (iii) benchmark our predictions with results from\nalternative numerical methodologies, and (iv) model complex crack paths and\nfailure in three dimensional functionally graded solids. The suitability of\nphase field fracture methods in capturing the crack deflections intrinsic to\ncrack tip mode-mixity due to material gradients is demonstrated.

To solve that further techniques have to be developed in the\ncurrent work. Further, by a suitable transformation between gamma models with\nand without intercept optimality results may be transferred from one model to\nthe other. Additionally by means of The General Equivalence Theorem optimality\ncan be characterized for multiple regression by a system of polynomial\ninequalities which can be solved analytically or by computer algebra. By this\nnecessary and sufficient conditions on the parameter values can be obtained for\nthe local D-optimality of particular designs. The robustness of the derived\ndesigns with respect to misspecifications of the initial parameter values is\nexamined by means of their local D-efficiencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Apr 2019 22:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-22"}

In cursive script, overlapped characters\nare serious issue in the process of character segmentations as characters are\ndeprived from their discriminative parts using conventional linear segmentation\nstrategy. Hence, non-linear segmentation is an utmost need to avoid loss of\ncharacters parts and to enhance character/script recognition accuracy. This\npaper presents an improved approach for non-linear segmentation of the\noverlapped characters in handwritten roman script. The proposed technique is\ncomposed of a sequence of heuristic rules based on geometrical features of\ncharacters to locate possible non-linear character boundaries in a cursive\nscript word. However, to enhance efficiency, heuristic approach is integrated\nwith trained ensemble neural network validation strategy for verification of\ncharacter boundaries. Accordingly, correct boundaries are retained and\nincorrect are removed based on ensemble neural networks vote. Finally, based on\nverified valid segmentation points, characters are segmented non-linearly. For\nfair comparison CEDAR benchmark database is experimented. The experimental\nresults are much better than conventional linear character segmentation\ntechniques reported in the state of art. Ensemble neural network play vital\nrole to enhance character segmentation accuracy as compared to individual\nneural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 2019 08:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}
