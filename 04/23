In this paper, we investigate how to integrate the semantic\nrelationship propagation between AUs in a deep neural network framework to\nenhance the feature representation of facial regions, and propose an AU\nsemantic relationship embedded representation learning (SRERL) framework.\nSpecifically, by analyzing the symbiosis and mutual exclusion of AUs in various\nfacial expressions, we organize the facial AUs in the form of structured\nknowledge-graph and integrate a Gated Graph Neural Network (GGNN) in a\nmulti-scale CNN framework to propagate node information through the graph for\ngenerating enhanced AU representation.

From the emulation of 1-D quantum phases to the potential\nrealization of Majorana edge states, spin chains are unique systems to study.\nThe advent of scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) based techniques has\npermitted us to engineer spin chains in an atom-by-atom fashion via atom\nmanipulation and to access their spin states on the ultimate atomic scale.\nHere, we present the current state of research on spin correlations and\ndynamics of atomic spin chains as studied by the STM. After a brief review of\nthe main properties of spin chains on solid surfaces, we classify spin chains\naccording to the coupling of their magnetic moments with the holding substrate.\nThis classification scheme takes into account that the nature and lifetimes of\nthe spin-chain excitation intrinsically depend on the holding substrate. We\nfirst show the interest of using insulating layers on metals, which generally\nresults in an increase in the spin state's lifetimes such that their quantized\nnature gets evident and they are individually accessible. Next, we show that\nthe use of semiconductor substrates promises additional control through the\ntunable electron density via doping. When the coupling to the substrate is\nincreased for spin chains on metals, the substrate conduction electron mediated\ninteractions can lead to emergent exotic phases of the coupled spin\nchain-substrate conduction electron system. A particularly interesting example\nis furnished by superconductors. Magnetic impurities induce states in the\nsuperconducting gap. Due to the extended nature of the spin chain, the in-gap\nstates develop into bands that can lead to the emergence of 1-D topological\nsuperconductivity and, consequently to the appearance of Majorana edge states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 16:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-10"}

A\ncommon strategy for decision-making uses a predictor to assign individuals a\nrisk score; then, individuals are selected or rejected on the basis of this\nscore. In this work, we study a formal framework for measuring the information\ncontent of predictors. Central to this framework is the notion of a refinement,\nfirst studied by Degroot and Fienberg.

In turn, refinements provide a simple but effective\ntool for reducing disparity in treatment and impact without sacrificing the\nutility of the predictions.

In this paper we address the problem of representing choice in the\nstrand space model of cryptographic protocols, particularly as it is used in\nthe Maude-NPA cryptographic protocol analysis tool. To achieve this goal, we\ndevelop and give formal semantics to a process algebra for cryptographic\nprotocols that supports a rich taxonomy of choice primitives for composing\nstrand spaces. In our taxonomy, deterministic and non-deterministic choices are\nbroken down further. Non-deterministic choice can be either explicit, i.e., one\nof two paths is chosen, or implicit, i.e., the value of a variable is chosen\nnon-deterministically. Likewise, deterministic choice can be either an explicit\nif-then-else choice, i.e., one path is chosen if a predicate is satisfied,\nwhile the other is chosen if it is not, or implicit deterministic choice, i.e.,\nexecution continues only if a certain pattern is matched. We have identified a\nclass of choices which includes finite branching and some cases of infinite\nbranching, which we address in this paper. We provide a bisimulation result\nbetween the expected forwards execution semantics of the new process algebra\nand the original symbolic backwards semantics of Maude-NPA that preserves\nattack reachability.

We illustrate its expressive\npower and naturalness with various examples, and show how it can be effectively\nused in formal analysis.

This can occur for weak washout or when the\nasymmetry is partly protected by being transferred to spectator fields. We thus\nstudy the relevance of relativistic effects for leptogenesis in a minimal\nseesaw model with two sterile neutrinos in the strongly hierarchical limit.\nStarting from first principles, we derive a set of momentum-averaged fluid\nequations to calculate the final $B-L$ asymmetry as a function of the washout\nstrength and for different initial conditions at order one accuracy. For this,\nwe take the leading fluid approximation for the relativistic $CP$-even and odd\nrates. Assuming that spectator fields remain in chemical equilibrium, we find\nthat for weak washout, relativistic corrections lead to a sign flip and an\nenhancement of the asymmetry for a vanishing initial abundance of sterile\nneutrinos. As an example for the effect of partially equilibrated spectators,\nwe consider bottom-Yukawa and weak-sphaleron interactions in leptogenesis\ndriven by sterile neutrinos with masses $\\gtrsim 5\\times10^{12}$ GeV. For a\nvanishing initial abundance of sterile neutrinos, this can give rise to another\nflip and an absolute enhancement of the final asymmetry in the strong washout\nregime by up to two orders of magnitude relative to the cases either without\nspectators or with fully equilibrated ones. These effects are less pronounced\nfor thermal initial conditions for the sterile neutrinos. The $CP$-violating\nsource in the relativistic regime at early times is important as it is\nproportional to the product of lepton-number violating and lepton-number\nconserving rates, and therefore less suppressed than an extrapolation of the\nnonrelativistic approximations may suggest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 17:10:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 09:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-10"}

The capability of dynamic resource provisioning is a\nfundamental driving factor for users to adopt the cloud technology. The aspect\nis important for cloud service providers to optimize the expense for running\nthe infrastructure as well. Despite many technological advances in related\nareas, however, it is still the case that the infrastructure providers must\ndecide hardware configuration before deploying a cloud infrastructure,\nespecially from the storage's perspective. This static nature of the storage\nprovisioning practice can cause many problems in meeting tenant requirements,\nwhich often come later into the picture. In this paper, we propose a system\ncalled IOArbiter that enables the dynamic creation of underlying storage\nimplementation in the cloud. IOArbiter defers storage provisioning to the time\nat which a tenant actually requests a storage space. As a result, an underlying\nstorage implementation, e.g., RAID-5, 6 or Ceph storage pool with 6+3 erasure\ncoding, will be materialized at the volume creation time. Using our prototype\nimplementation with Openstack Cinder, we show that IOArbiter can simultaneously\nsatisfy a number of different tenant demands, which may not be possible with a\nstatic configuration strategy.

The sensitivity to metallicity is of\nparticular interest. We find that a rise in metallicity leads basically to\nreducing the photodissociation rates of the hydrocarbons and therefore the haze\nmonomer production rates. This is due to an enhanced photon-shielding effect by\nthe major photon absorbers such as $\\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\\mathrm{CO}$,\n$\\mathrm{CO_2}$, and $\\mathrm{O_2}$, existing at higher altitudes than the\nhydrocarbons. We also find that at relatively short wavelengths ($\\lesssim$ 2-3\n$\\mu$m), the absorption features in transmission spectra are most pronounced\nfor moderate metallicities such as 100 times the solar metallicity, whereas the\nlower the metallicity the stronger the absorption features at relatively long\nwavelengths ($\\gtrsim$ 2-3 $\\mu$m), where the contribution of haze is small.\nThese are because of the two competing effects of reduced haze production rate\nand atmospheric scale height for higher metallicities. For the other model\nparameters, we show that stronger absorption features appear in transmission\nspectra of the atmospheres with lower UV irradiation, lower C/O ratio, higher\neddy diffusion coefficient, and higher temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

Due to the added $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry, a SM\ngauge singlet fermion, with mass of order keV, is stable and can be a warm DM\ncandidate. Also, the same $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry helps the lightest\nright-handed neutrino, with mass of order GeV, to be a stable or long-lived\nparticle by making a corresponding Yukawa coupling very small. This provides a\npossibility of a two component DM scenario as well. Firstly, in the absence of\na GeV DM component (i.e., without tuning its corresponding Yukawa coupling to\nbe very small), we consider only a keV DM as a single component DM, which is\nproduced by the freeze-in mechanism via the decay of the extra $Z'$ gauge boson\nassociated to $U(1)_{B-L}$ and can consistently explain the DM relic density\nmeasurements. In contrast with most of the existing literature, we have found a\nreasonable DM production from the annihilation processes. After numerically\nstudying the DM production, we show the dependence of the DM relic density as a\nfunction of its relevant free parameters. We use these results to obtain the\nparameter space regions that are compatible with the DM relic density bound.\nSecondly, we study a two component DM scenario and emphasize that the current\nDM relic density bound can be satisfied for a wide range of parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 18:19:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 10:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-24"}

Also, most of the\ngeneric object detectors process axis-aligned rectangular areas though, a thin\nand long rifle may actually cover only a small percentage of that area and the\nrest may contain irrelevant details suppressing the required object signatures.\nTo handle these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised Orientation Aware\nObject Detection (OAOD) algorithm which learns to detect oriented object\nbounding boxes (OBB) while using AxisAligned Bounding Boxes (AABB) for\ntraining. The proposed OAOD is different from the existing oriented object\ndetectors which strictly require OBB during training which may not always be\npresent. The goal of training on AABB and detection of OBB is achieved by\nemploying a multistage scheme, with Stage-1 predicting the AABB and Stage-2\npredicting OBB. In-between the two stages, the oriented proposal generation\nmodule along with the object aligned RoI pooling is designed to extract\nfeatures based on the predicted orientation and to make these features\norientation invariant. A diverse and challenging dataset consisting of eleven\nthousand images is also proposed for firearm detection which is manually\nannotated for firearm classification and localization. The proposed ITU Firearm\ndataset (ITUF) contains a wide range of guns and rifles. The OAOD algorithm is\nevaluated on the ITUF dataset and compared with current state-of-the-art object\ndetectors, including fully supervised oriented object detectors. OAOD has\noutperformed both types of object detectors with a significant margin. The\nexperimental results (mAP: 88.3 on AABB & mAP: 77.5 on OBB) demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm for firearm detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 18:56:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 19:40:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

As far as I know, this is the first time an unsupervised disparity\nfusion not using ground truth disparity data has been proposed. In this paper,\na mathematical model for disparity fusion is proposed to guide an adversarial\nnetwork to train effectively without ground truth disparity data. The initial\ndisparity maps are inputted from the left view along with auxiliary information\n(gradient, left & right intensity image) into the refiner and the refiner is\ntrained to output the refined disparity map registered on the left view. The\nrefined left disparity map and left intensity image are used to reconstruct a\nfake right intensity image. Finally, the fake and real right intensity images\n(from the right stereo vision camera) are fed into the discriminator. In the\nmodel, the refiner is trained to output a refined disparity value close to the\nweighted sum of the disparity inputs for global initialisation. Then, three\nrefinement principles are adopted to refine the results further. (1) The\nreconstructed intensity error between the fake and real right intensity image\nis minimised.

Inspired by the work of Colding-Minicozzi\non the mean curvature flow, we define an entropy functional and after proving\nan $\\epsilon$-regularity theorem, we show that low entropy initial data lead to\nsolutions of the flow which exist for all time and converge smoothly to a $G_2$\nstructure with divergence free torsion. We also study the finite-time\nsingularities and show that at the singular time the flow converges to a smooth\n$G_2$ structure outside a closed set of finite 5-dimensional Hausdorff measure.\nFinally, we prove that if the singularity is of Type-I then a sequence of\nblow-ups of a solution has a subsequence which converges to a shrinking soliton\nfor the flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 21:32:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 May 2019 16:16:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 18:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-15"}

In\nmany practical situations, the underlying topology might change randomly with\ntime, due to link failures such as changing friendships, road blocks or sensor\nmalfunctions. Thus, it leads to poorly controlled dynamics if randomness is not\nproperly accounted for. We consider the problem of controlling the network\nstate when the topology varies randomly with time. Our problem concerns target\nstates that are bandlimited over the graph; these are states that have nonzero\nfrequency content only on a specific graph frequency band. We thus leverage\ngraph signal processing and exploit the bandlimited model to drive the network\nstate from a fixed set of control nodes. When controlling the state from a few\nnodes, we observe that spurious, out-of-band frequency content is created.\nTherefore, we focus on controlling the network state over the desired frequency\nband, and then use a graph filter to get rid of the unwanted frequency content.\nTo account for the topological randomness, we develop the concept of\ncontrollability in the mean, which consists of driving the expected network\nstate towards the target state. A detailed mean squared error analysis is\nperformed to quantify the statistical deviation between the final controlled\nstate on a particular graph realization and the actual target state.

Methods: We propose to use Residual Blocks with a 3x3 kernel\nsize for local feature extraction, and Non-Local Blocks to extract the global\nfeatures. The Non-Local Block has the ability to extract global features\nwithout using a huge number of parameters. The key idea behind the Non-Local\nBlock is to apply matrix multiplications between features on the same feature\nmaps.

Resolvent analysis of the data-assimilated means identifies\nlow-rank behaviour only in the vicinity of the shedding frequency for A0 and\nnone of its harmonics. The resolvent operator for the A10 case, on the other\nhand, identifies two linear mechanisms whose frequencies are a close match with\nthose identified by SPOD.

This gapless mode arises from the out-of-phase\noscillations of the density fluctuations in the electron and the hole pockets\nof a type-II DSM. It originates beyond a critical wave-vector along the\ndirection of the tilt axis, owing to the momentum separation of the electron\nand hole pockets.

First,\nby using visual cues in monocular images, several multi-layer regions are\nelaborately inferred to reveal the distances from the camera. Second, several\nnovel obstacle-aware occlusion edge maps are constructed to well capture the\ncontours of tiny obstacles, which combines cues from each layer. Third, to\nensure the existence of the tiny obstacle proposals, the maps from all layers\nare used for proposals extraction. Finally, based on these proposals containing\ntiny obstacles, a novel obstacle-aware regressor is proposed to generate an\nobstacle occupied probability map with high confidence.

The ghostly sector of the second-order\nderivative of the scalar is absorbed into the projective gauge mode when the\nunitary gauge can be imposed. Incidentally, the connection does not have the\nkinetic term in these theories and then it is just an auxiliary field. We can\nthus (at least in principle) integrate the connection out and obtain a form of\nscalar-tensor theories in the Riemannian geometry. The projective symmetry then\nhides in the ghost-free scalar-tensor theories. As an explicit example, we show\nthe relationship between the quadratic order scalar-metric-affine theory and\nthe quadratic U-degenerate theory. The explicit correspondence between the\nmetric-affine (Palatini) formalism and the metric one could be also useful for\nanalyzing phenomenology such as inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 06:54:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 01:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

It is\nobvious that different objects have different levels of danger to autonomous\nvehicles. An evaluation system is needed to automatically determine the danger\nlevel of the object for the autonomous vehicle. It would be too subjective and\nincomplete if the system were completely defined by humans. Based on this, we\npropose a framework based on nonparametric Bayesian learning method -- a sticky\nhierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model(sticky HDP-HMM), and\ndiscover the relationship between driving scenarios and driving styles. We use\nthe analysis of driving styles of autonomous vehicles to reflect the risk\nlevels of driving scenarios to the vehicles. In this framework, we firstly use\nsticky HDP-HMM to extract driving styles from the dataset and get different\nclusters, then an evaluation system is proposed to evaluate and rank the\nurgency levels of the clusters. Finally, we map the driving scenarios to the\nranking results and thus get clusters of driving scenarios in different risk\nlevels. More importantly, we find the relationship between driving scenarios\nand driving styles. The experiment shows that our framework can cluster and\nrank driving styles of different urgency levels and find the relationship\nbetween driving scenarios and driving styles and the conclusions also fit\npeople's common sense when driving. Furthermore, this framework can be used for\nautonomous vehicles to estimate risk levels of driving scenarios and help them\nmake precise and safe decisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 06:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

We propose Surface2Volume, a partition algorithm\ncapable of producing such assemblable parts, each of which is affiliated with a\nsingle attribute, the outer surface of whose assembly conforms to the input\nsurface geometry and segmentation. In computing the partition we strictly\nenforce conformity with surface segmentation and assemblability, and optimize\nfor ease of fabrication by minimizing part count, promoting part simplicity,\nand simplifying assembly sequencing. We note that computing the desired\npartition requires solving for three types of variables: per-part assembly\ntrajectories, partition topology, i.e. the connectivity of the interface\nsurfaces separating the different parts, and the geometry, or location, of\nthese interfaces. We efficiently produce the desired partitions by addressing\none type of variables at a time: first computing the assembly trajectories,\nthen determining interface topology, and finally computing interface locations\nthat allow parts assemblability. We algorithmically identify inputs that\nnecessitate sequential assembly, and partition these inputs gradually by\ncomputing and disassembling a subset of assemblable parts at a time. We\ndemonstrate our method....\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 09:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

SPH performs\ninterpolation of physical properties over neighboring discretization points\n(called SPH particles) that dynamically adapt their distribution to the mass\ndensity field of the fluid. When a fault (e.g., a bit-flip) strikes the\ncomputation or the data associated with a particle, the resulting error is\nsilently propagated to all nearest neighbors through such interpolation steps.\nSPR replicates the computation and data of a few carefully selected SPH\nparticles. SDCs are detected when the data of a particle differs, due to\ncorruption, from its replicated counterpart. SPR is able to detect many DRAM\nSDCs as they propagate by ensuring that all particles have at least one\nneighbor that is replicated. The detection capabilities of SPR were assessed\nthrough a set of error-injection and detection experiments and the overhead of\nSPR was evaluated via a set of strong-scaling experiments conducted on an HPC\nsystem.

Specifically, we\nfirst train the stereo teacher network by fully utilizing the binocular\nperception of 3-D geometry and then use the depth predictions of the teacher\nnetwork to train the student network for monocular depth inference. This\nenables us to exploit all available depth data from massive unlabeled stereo\npairs. We propose a strategy that involves the use of a data ensemble to merge\nthe multiple depth predictions of the teacher network to improve the training\nsamples by collecting non-trivial knowledge beyond a single prediction. To\nrefine the inaccurate depth estimation that is used when training the student\nnetwork, we further propose stereo confidence-guided regression loss that\nhandles the unreliable pseudo depth values in occlusion, texture-less region,\nand repetitive pattern. To complement the existing dataset comprising outdoor\ndriving scenes, we built a novel large-scale dataset consisting of one million\noutdoor stereo images taken using hand-held stereo cameras. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that the monocular depth estimation network provides feature\nrepresentations that are suitable for high-level vision tasks. The experimental\nresults for various outdoor scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and\nflexibility of our approach, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 10:02:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 03:23:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}

To illustrate the concept I will establish\nnovel upper bounds of algorithmic randomness for elementary cellular automata.\nI will discuss how the practice of science consists in conceiving a model that\nstarts from certain initial values, running a computable instantiation, and\nawaiting a result in order to determine where the system may be in a future\nstate--in a shorter time than the time taken by the actual unfolding of the\nphenomenon in question.

In addition, magnetic cancellation occurs around the jet\na few hours before and after the jet is observed. 4) The temperature\ndistribution of the accelerated plasma, which was estimated from Doppler\nvelocity maps, the calculated differential emission measure, and synthetic\nspectra show that there is no clear dependence between the plasma velocity and\nits temperature. For the third result above, observational results suggest that\nmagnetic cancellation is probably related to the occurrence of the jet and\nfilament formation. This result suggests that the trigger of the jet is\nmagnetic cancellation rather than an emerging magnetic arch flux.

Although there have been many interesting\nclusters discovered with the RASS data, the broad point spread function (PSF)\nof the ROSAT satellite limits the amount of spatial information of the detected\nobjects. This leads to the discovery of new cluster features when a\nre-observation is performed with higher resolution X-ray satellites. Here we\npresent the results from XMM-Newton observations of three clusters:\nRXCJ2306.6-1319, ZwCl1665 and RXCJ0034.6-0208, for which the observations\nreveal a double or triple system of extended components.

For\neach structure in each cluster, we determine the redshift with the X-ray\nspectrum and find that the components are not part of the same cluster. This is\nconfirmed by an optical spectroscopic analysis of the galaxy members.\nTherefore, the total number of clusters is actually 7 and not 3. We derive\nglobal cluster properties of each extended component. We compare the measured\nproperties to lower-redshift group samples, and find a good agreement. Our flux\nmeasurements reveal that only one component of the ZwCl1665 cluster has a flux\nabove the eeHIFLUGCS limit, while the other clusters will no longer be part of\nthe sample. These examples demonstrate that cluster-cluster projections can\nbias X-ray cluster catalogues and that with high-resolution X-ray follow-up\nthis bias can be corrected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 12:31:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

The\nimplementation cost, performance, and power efficiency of HDA beamforming\ndepends on the level of connectivity and reconfigurability of the analog\nbeamforming network. In this paper, we investigate the performance of two\ntypical architectures that can be regarded as extreme cases, namely, the\nfully-connected (FC) and the one-stream-per-subarray (OSPS) architectures. In\nthe FC architecture each RF antenna port is connected to all antenna elements\nof the array, while in the OSPS architecture the RF antenna ports are connected\nto disjoint subarrays. We jointly consider the initial beam acquisition and\ndata communication phases, such that the latter takes place by using the beam\ndirection information obtained by the former. We use the state-of-the-art beam\nalignment (BA) scheme previously proposed by the authors and consider a family\nof MU-MIMO precoding schemes well adapted to the beam information extracted\nfrom the BA phase. We also evaluate the power efficiency of the two HDA\narchitectures taking into account the power dissipation at different hardware\ncomponents as well as the power backoff under typical power amplifier\nconstraints. Numerical results show that the two architectures achieve similar\nsum spectral efficiency, while the OSPS architecture is advantageous with\nrespect to the FC case in terms of hardware complexity and power efficiency, at\nthe sole cost of a slightly longer BA time-to-acquisition due to its reduced\nbeam angle resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 12:31:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 2019 09:54:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-08"}

Deep extragalactic\nimaging surveys meet this criteria due to the cosmological tenet of isotropy.\nHere we train an SGAN to generate images resembling the iconic Hubble Space\nTelescope eXtreme Deep Field (XDF). We show that the properties of 'galaxies'\nin generated images have a high level of fidelity with galaxies in the real XDF\nin terms of abundance, morphology, magnitude distributions and colours. As a\ndemonstration we have generated a 7.6-billion pixel 'generative deep field'\nspanning 1.45 degrees. The technique can be generalised to any appropriate\nimaging training set, offering a new purely data-driven approach for producing\nrealistic mock surveys and synthetic data at scale, in astrophysics and beyond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 12:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

Here, we present high-performance vertical van der\nWaals heterostructure-based photodetectors integrated on a silicon photonics\nplatform. Our vertical MoTe2/graphene heterostructure design minimizes the\ncarrier transit path length in TMDCs and enables a record-high measured\nbandwidth of at least 24GHz under a moderate bias voltage of -3 volts. Applying\na higher bias or employing thinner MoTe2 flakes boosts the bandwidth even to\n50GHz.

A\nvery recent work tries to bypass optical flows via a deep network with\nskip-connections, however, which still suffers from ghosting artifacts for\nsevere movement. To avoid the ghosting from the source, we propose a novel\nattention-guided end-to-end deep neural network (AHDRNet) to produce\nhigh-quality ghost-free HDR images.

Digital\nsequences are prototypes of sequences with low discrepancy. First examples were\ngiven by Il'ya Meerovich Sobol' and by Henri Faure with their famous\nconstructions. The unifying theory was developed later by Harald Niederreiter.\nNowadays there is a magnitude of examples of digital sequences and it is\nclassical knowledge that the star discrepancy of the initial $N$ elements of\nsuch sequences can achieve a rate of order $(\\log N)^s/N$, where $s$ denotes\nthe dimension. On the other hand, very little has been known about the $L_p$\nnorm of the discrepancy function of digital sequences for finite $p$, apart\nfrom evident estimates in terms of star discrepancy. In this article we give a\nreview of some recent results on various types of discrepancy of digital\nsequences.

In these environments, the electron density\n(n_e) plays a critical role in the gas dynamics, chemistry, and collisional\nexcitation of certain molecules. We determine n_e in the prototypical strongly\nirradiated photodissociation region (PDR), the Orion Bar, from the detection of\nnew millimeter-wave carbon recombination lines (mmCRLs) and existing far-IR\n[13CII] hyperfine line observations. We detect 12 mmCRLs (including alpha,\nbeta, and gamma transitions) observed with the IRAM 30m telescope, at ~25''\nangular resolution, toward the H/H2 dissociation front (DF) of the Bar. We also\npresent a mmCRL emission cut across the PDR. These lines trace the C+/C/CO gas\ntransition layer. As the much lower frequency carbon radio recombination lines,\nmmCRLs arise from neutral PDR gas and not from ionized gas in the adjacent HII\nregion. This is readily seen from their narrow line profiles (dv=2.6+/-0.4\nkm/s) and line peak LSR velocities (v_LSR=+10.7+/-0.2 km/s). Optically thin\n[13CII] hyperfine lines and molecular lines - emitted close to the DF by trace\nspecies such as reactive ions CO+ and HOC+ - show the same line profiles.

A frame mask operates on the transfer\ncoefficients of a signal and consequently converts the signal into a\ncounterpart signal. It depicts the difference between the two signals. In\npreceding studies, frame masks based on regular Gabor transform were applied to\nsingle-note instrumental sound analysis. This study extends the frame mask\napproach to speech signals. For voiced speech, the fundamental frequency is\nusually changing consecutively over time. We employ NSGT with pitch-dependent\nand therefore time-varying frequency resolution to attain harmonic alignment in\nthe transform domain and hence yield harmonic-aligned frame masks for speech\nsignals. We propose to apply the harmonic-aligned frame mask to\ncontent-dependent speaker comparison. Frame masks, computed from voiced signals\nof a same vowel but from different speakers, were utilized as similarity\nmeasures to compare and distinguish the speaker identities (SID). Results\nobtained with deep neural networks demonstrate that the proposed frame mask is\nvalid in representing speaker characteristics and shows a potential for SID\napplications in limited data scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 15:21:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

The system consists of a large number of randomly\n(Poisson-distributed) located access points (APs) serving multiple information\nusers (IUs) and an information-untrusted dual-antenna active energy harvester\n(EH). The active EH uses one antenna to legitimately harvest energy and the\nother antenna to eavesdrop information. The APs are networked by a centralized\ninfinite backhaul which allows the APs to synchronize and cooperate via a\ncentral processing unit (CPU). Closed-form expressions for the average\nharvested energy (AHE) and a tight lower bound on the ergodic secrecy rate\n(ESR) are derived. The obtained lower bound on the ESR takes into account the\nIUs' knowledge attained by downlink effective precoded-channel training. Since\nthe transmit power constraint is per AP, the ESR is nonlinear in terms of the\ntransmit power elements of the APs and that imposes new challenges in\nformulating a convex power control problem for the downlink transmission. To\ndeal with these nonlinearities, a new method of balancing the transmit power\namong the APs via relaxed semidefinite programming (SDP) which is proved to be\nrank-one globally optimal is derived. A fair comparison between the proposed\ncell-free and the colocated massive MIMO systems shows that the cell-free MIMO\noutperforms the colocated MIMO over the interval in which the AHE constraint is\nlow and vice versa. Also, the cell-free MIMO is found to be more immune to the\nincrease in the active eavesdropping power than the colocated MIMO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 15:06:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-26"}

The\nconvolutional filter is a powerful tool for modeling spatial relations and\norganizing grouped signals, so the proposed methods map the channel signals\nonto a pseudo-image, like putting a lens into convolution internal structure.\nConsequently, not only the diversity of channels is increased, but also the\ncomplementarity and completeness can be explicitly enhanced. The proposed\narchitecture is lightweight and easy to be implemented. It provides an\nefficient self-organization strategy for convolutional networks so as to\nimprove their efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments are conducted\non multiple benchmark image recognition data sets including CIFAR, SVHN and\nImageNet. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the Inner-Imaging\nmechanism with the most popular convolutional networks as the backbones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 16:44:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 2019 16:50:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 21:19:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

Therefore, there arises a\nnecessity of developing citation network clustering and prediction of future\ncitations.

As a result, we\nconfirmed nested SBM is appropriate for graph clustering of patent citation\nnetworks.

Since\ndecision of each agent affects neighbor agents, this approach creates a\nclassical non-stationary environment. Thus, each agent not only needs to learn\nfrom the past experience but also has to consider decision of neighbors to\novercome dynamic changes of the traffic network. Fuzzy Q-learning and Game\ntheory are employed to make policy based on previous experiences and decision\nof neighbor agents.

However, achieving similar success in NLP would\nbe more challenging due to the discrete nature of text. In this work, we\nintroduce a method using knowledge distillation to effectively exploit GAN\nsetup for text generation. We demonstrate how autoencoders (AEs) can be used\nfor providing a continuous representation of sentences, which is a smooth\nrepresentation that assign non-zero probabilities to more than one word. We\ndistill this representation to train the generator to synthesize similar smooth\nrepresentations.
