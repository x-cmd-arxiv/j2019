The\nspectral density includes radiative corrections in leading, next-to-leading,\nand next-to-next-to-leading-order of perturbative QCD. Besides, it takes into\naccount the twist-four and twist-six terms. The hard-scattering part in the\nLCSR is convoluted with various pion distribution amplitudes with different\nmorphologies in order to obtain a wide range of predictions for the form\nfactor, including two-loop evolution which accounts for heavy-quark thresholds.\nWe then use nonlinear time series analysis to extract information on the\nlong-term $Q^2$ behavior of the measured scaled form factor in terms of\nstate-space attractors embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.

It has been observed that sometimes the autoencoder\n\"generalizes\" so well that it can also reconstruct anomalies well, leading to\nthe miss detection of anomalies. To mitigate this drawback for autoencoder\nbased anomaly detector, we propose to augment the autoencoder with a memory\nmodule and develop an improved autoencoder called memory-augmented autoencoder,\ni.e. MemAE. Given an input, MemAE firstly obtains the encoding from the encoder\nand then uses it as a query to retrieve the most relevant memory items for\nreconstruction.

The\nreconstruction will thus tend to be close to a normal sample.

The two images are encoded as\nfeature hierarchies by siamese convolutional nets. Then a hierarchy of aligner\nmodules computes the transform in a coarse-to-fine recursion. Each module\nreceives as input the transform that was computed by the module at the level\nabove, aligns the source and target encodings at the same level of the\nhierarchy, and then computes an improved approximation to the transform using a\nconvolutional net. The entire architecture of encoder and aligner nets is\ntrained in a self-supervised manner to minimize the squared error between\nsource and target remaining after alignment. We show that siamese encoding\nenables more accurate alignment than the image pyramids of SPyNet, a previous\ndeep learning approach to coarse-to-fine alignment. Furthermore,\nself-supervision applies even without target values for the transform, unlike\nthe strongly supervised SPyNet.

Since such changes are dynamic, correcting them\nrequires measurement of the fibre transmission matrix (TM) in situ immediately\nbefore imaging. TM calibration typically requires access to both the proximal\nand distal facets of the fibre simultaneously, which is not feasible during\nmost realistic usage scenarios without compromising the thin form factor with\nbulky distal optics. Here, we introduce a new approach to determine the TM of\nmulti-mode fibre (MMF) or multi-core fibre (MCF) in a reflection-mode\nconfiguration without access to the distal facet. A thin stack of structured\nmetasurface reflectors is used at the distal facet to introduce\nwavelength-dependent, spatially heterogeneous reflectance profiles. We derive a\nfirst-order fibre model that compensates these wavelength-dependent changes in\nthe TM and show that, consequently, the reflected data at 3 wavelengths can be\nused to unambiguously reconstruct the full TM by an iterative optimisation\nalgorithm. We then present a method for sample illumination and imaging\nfollowing TM reconstruction.

We demonstrate TM reconstruction and imaging first using simulated\nnon-unitary fibres and noisy reflection matrices, then using much larger\nexperimentally-measured TMs of a densely-packed MCF, and finally on an\nexperimentally-measured multi-wavelength set of TMs recorded from a MMF.

The net current in a given magnetic polarity is algebraic sum of\ndirect-current (DC) and return-current (RC) and the ratio $|DC/RC|$ is a\nmeasure of degree of net-current-neutralization (NCN). In the emerging ARs, the\nnon-neutrality of these currents builds with the onset of flux emergence,\nfollowing the relaxation to neutrality during the separation motion of bipolar\nregions. Accordingly, some emerging ARs are source regions of CMEs occurring at\nthe time of higher level non-neutrality. ARs in the post-emergence phase can be\nCME productive provided they have interacting bipolar regions with converging\nand shearing motions. In these cases, the net current evolves with higher level\n($>1.3$) of non-neutrality. Differently, the $|DC/RC|$ in flaring and quiet ARs\nvary near unity. In all the AR samples, the $|DC/RC|$ is higher for chiral\ncurrent density than that for vertical current density. Owing to the fact that\nthe non-neutralized currents arise in the vicinity of sheared\npolarity-inversion-lines (SPILs), the profiles of the total length of SPIL\nsegments and the degree of NCN follow each other with a positive correlation.\nWe find that the SPIL is localized as small segments in flaring-ARs whereas it\nis long continuous in CME-producing ARs. These observations demonstrate the\ndividing line between the CMEs and flares with the difference being in global\nor local nature of magnetic shear in the AR that reflected in non-neutralized\ncurrents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 16:40:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

The current state of the art model for this task first\ncomputes a question-aware representation for the passage and then selects the\noption which has the maximum similarity with this representation. However, when\nhumans perform this task they do not just focus on option selection but use a\ncombination of elimination and selection. Specifically, a human would first try\nto eliminate the most irrelevant option and then read the passage again in the\nlight of this new information (and perhaps ignore portions corresponding to the\neliminated option). This process could be repeated multiple times till the\nreader is finally ready to select the correct option. We propose ElimiNet, a\nneural network-based model which tries to mimic this process. Specifically, it\nhas gates which decide whether an option can be eliminated given the passage,\nquestion pair and if so it tries to make the passage representation orthogonal\nto this eliminated option (akin to ignoring portions of the passage\ncorresponding to the eliminated option). The model makes multiple rounds of\npartial elimination to refine the passage representation and finally uses a\nselection module to pick the best option. We evaluate our model on the recently\nreleased large scale RACE dataset and show that it outperforms the current\nstate of the art model on 7 out of the $13$ question types in this dataset.\nFurther, we show that taking an ensemble of our elimination-selection based\nmethod with a selection based method gives us an improvement of 3.1% over the\nbest-reported performance on this dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 16:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-05"}

We used a sample of 28,749 Facebook\nusers to build a language prediction model of survey-reported depression and\nanxiety, and validated it on Twitter on a sample of 887 users who had taken\nanxiety and depression surveys. We then applied it to a different set of 4,132\nTwitter users to impute language-based depression and anxiety labels, and\nextracted interpretable features of posted and profile pictures to uncover the\nassociations with users' depression and anxiety, controlling for demographics.\nFor depression, we find that profile pictures suppress positive emotions rather\nthan display more negative emotions, likely because of social media\nself-presentation biases.

Most resource theories\nfocus on quantum states and study their interconversions. Although quantum\nchannels are generally used as the tool for state manipulation, such a\nmanipulation capability can be naturally regarded as a generalized quantum\nresource, leading to an open research direction in the resource theories of\nquantum channels. Various resource-theoretic properties of channels have been\ninvestigated, however, without treating channels themselves as operational\nresources that can also be manipulated and converted. In this Letter, we\naddress this problem by first proposing a general resource framework for\nquantum channels and introducing resource monotones based on general distance\nquantifiers of channels. We study the interplay between channel and state\nresource theories by relating resource monotones of a quantum channel to its\nmanipulation power of the state resource. Regarding channels as operational\nresources, we introduce asymptotic channel distillation and dilution, the most\nimportant tasks in an operational resource theory, and show how to bound the\nconversion rates with channel resource monotones. Finally, we apply our results\nto quantum coherence as an example and introduce the coherence of channels,\nwhich characterizes the coherence generation ability of channels. We consider\nasymptotic channel distillation and dilution with maximally incoherent\noperations and find the theory asymptotically irreversible, in contrast to the\nasymptotic reversibility of the coherence of states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 17:33:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 May 2019 14:35:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 18:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

At\nthe same time, a novel generalized hydrodynamic (GHD) approach, which captures\nexactly many asymptotic features of the integrable dynamics, has recently been\nintroduced. Interestingly, also this theory has a natural interpretation in\nterms of semiclassical particles and it is then natural to compare the two\napproaches.

Interestingly, the transport of\ntopological charge becomes sub-ballistic in these cases. Away from these limits\nwe find that the semiclassical predictions are only approximate and, in\ncontrast to the latter, the transport is always ballistic.

Detection of molecular and atomic gas\nin exocometary belts allows us to estimate molecular ice abundances and overall\nelemental abundances, enabling comparison with the Solar Nebula and Solar\nSystem comets. At the same time, observing star-grazing exocomets transiting in\nfront of their star (for planetary systems viewed edge-on) and exozodiacal dust\nin the systems' innermost regions gives unique dynamical insights into the\ninward scattering process producing delivery to inner rocky planets. The rapid\nadvances of this budding subfield of exoplanetary science will continue in the\nshort term with the upcoming JWST, WFIRST and PLATO missions.

By contrast, without RT, star formation regulation occurs\nonly through starbursts and their associated vigorous galactic outflows. In\nspite of this difference, the entire simulation suite (with the exception of\nmodels without any feedback) matches observed dwarf galaxy sizes, velocity\ndispersions, $V$-band magnitudes and dynamical mass-to-light-ratios. This is\nbecause such structural scaling relations are predominantly set by the host\ndark matter halo, with the remaining model-to-model variation being smaller\nthan the observational scatter. We find that only the stellar mass-metallicity\nrelation differentiates the galaxy formation models.

By establishing rates over a range of\nmetallicity, the dependence of deep mixing on metallicity is explored.

It has recently been recognized that the\nCEMP-no stars can be sub-divided into at least two groups, based on their\ndistinct morphology in the $A$(C)-[Fe/H] space, indicating the likely existence\nof multiple pathways for their formation. In this work, we compare the halo\nCEMP-no group morphology with that of stars found in satellite dwarf galaxies\nof the Milky Way -- a very similar $A$(C)-[Fe/H] pattern is found, providing\nclear evidence that halo CEMP-no stars were indeed accreted from their host\nmini-halos, similar in nature to those that formed in presently observed\nultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs) and dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. We also infer\nthat the previously noted \"anomalous\" CEMP-no halo stars (with high $A$(C) and\nlow [Ba/Fe] ratios) that otherwise would be associated with Group I may have\nthe same origin as the Group III CEMP-no halo stars, by analogy with the\nlocation of several Group III CEMP-no stars in the UFDs and dSphs and their\ndistinct separation from that of the CEMP-$s$ stars in the $A$(Ba)-$A$(C)\nspace. Interestingly, CEMP-no stars associated with UFDs include both Group II\nand Group III stars, while the more massive dSphs appear to have only Group II\nstars.

Automatic recognition\nof species in natural environment is a promising tool which would revolutionize\nvideo and image analysis for a wide range of applications in marine ecology.\nHowever, classifying fish from images captured by underwater cameras is in\ngeneral very challenging due to noise and illumination variations in water.\nPrevious classification methods in the literature relies on filtering the\nimages to separate the fish from the background or sharpening the images by\nremoving background noise.

A new non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA)\ntransmission protocol that incorporates orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)\nmodulation is proposed. Thereby, users with different mobility profiles are\ngrouped together for the implementation of NOMA. The proposed OTFS-NOMA\nprotocol is shown to be applicable to both uplink and downlink transmission,\nwhere sophisticated transmit and receive strategies are developed to remove\ninter-symbol interference and harvest both multi-path and multi-user diversity.\nAnalytical results demonstrate that both the high-mobility and low-mobility\nusers benefit from the application of OTFS-NOMA. In particular, the use of NOMA\nallows the spreading of the high-mobility users' signals over a large amount of\ntime-frequency resources, which enhances the OTFS resolution and improves the\ndetection reliability. In addition, OTFS-NOMA ensures that low-mobility users\nhave access to bandwidth resources which in conventional OTFS-orthogonal\nmultiple access (OTFS-NOMA) would be solely occupied by the high-mobility\nusers. Thus, OTFS-NOMA improves the spectral efficiency and reduces latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 20:32:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-08"}

Nonetheless, distinguishing\nrelevant history is challenging and a popular method of using dialogue recency\nfor that is inefficient. We, therefore, propose a novel framework for DST that\nidentifies relevant historical context by referring to the past utterances\nwhere a particular slot-value changes and uses that together with weighted\nsystem utterance to identify the relevant context.

Quantisation\nin such an anisotropic background has been argued to be problematic based on\nthe fact that the initial Kasner singularity, where the spatial anisotropy\nblows up, causes divergences to the effective frequencies squared for the\nperturbations, which render the standard quantisation procedure relying on the\nexistence of an adiabatic vacuum state inexecutable. Here, an essential aspect\nof the problem is that the ability in determining the quantum spectra of the\nfields is restricted. Without its knowledge, one cannot even choose physically\nfavourable states like the Bunch-Davies vacuum in de Sitter. We here argue that\nthis difficulty may be circumvented if only there is a period, even if\ntemporal, after the singularity where certain adiabatic conditions for the\nfields are met and the standard procedure of second quantisation can be carried\nout within the framework of the WKB approximation. We demonstrate that our\nprescription for determining the quantum energy spectrum is useful in making\nphysically meaningful predictions for the primordial gravitational waves in\ntriaxially anisotropic Kasner-de Sitter backgrounds.

Despite its crucial role in how a\nnumber of prominent self-tracking apps function, there has been relatively\nlittle investigation of the goal-setting and achievement aspects of\nself-tracking apps.\n  Here we explore this issue, investigating a particular goal setting and\nachievement process that is extensive, recorded, and crucial for both the app\nand its users' success: weight loss goals in MyFitnessPal. We present a\nlarge-scale study of 1.4 million users and weight loss goals, allowing for an\nunprecedented detailed view of how people set and achieve their goals. We find\nthat, even for difficult long-term goals, behavior within the first 7 days\npredicts those who ultimately achieve their goals, that is, those who lose at\nleast as much weight as they set out to, and those who do not. For instance,\nhigh amounts of early weight loss, which some researchers have classified as\nunsustainable, leads to higher goal achievement rates. We also show that early\nfood intake, self-monitoring motivation, and attitude towards the goal are\nimportant factors. We then show that we can use our findings to predict goal\nachievement with an accuracy of 79% ROC AUC just 7 days after a goal is set.\nFinally, we discuss how our findings could inform steps to improve goal\nachievement in self-tracking apps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 22:46:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-08"}

Firstly, we show how to translate\ncausal inference problems into an abstract statistical formalism without\nrequiring any structure beyond an arbitrarily-indexed family of probability\nmodels. The formalism is simple but can incorporate a variety of causal\nmodelling frameworks, including 'structural causal models', but also models\nexpressed in terms of, e.g., differential equations. We focus primarily on the\nstructural/graphical causal modelling literature, however. Secondly, we\nconsider the extent to which causal and statistical concerns can be cleanly\nseparated, examining the fundamental question: 'What can be estimated from\ndata?'. We call this the problem of estimability. We approach this by analysing\na standard formal definition of 'can be estimated' commonly adopted in the\ncausal inference literature -- identifiability -- in our abstract statistical\nformalism. We use elementary category theory to show that identifiability\nimplies the existence of a Fisher-consistent estimator, but also show that this\nestimator may be discontinuous, and thus unstable, in general. This difficulty\narises because the causal inference problem is, in general, an ill-posed\ninverse problem. Inverse problems have three conditions which must be satisfied\nto be considered well-posed: existence, uniqueness, and stability of solutions.\nHere identifiability corresponds to the question of uniqueness; in contrast, we\ntake estimability to mean satisfaction of all three conditions, i.e.\nwell-posedness. Lack of stability implies that naive translation of a causally\nidentifiable quantity into an achievable statistical estimation target may\nprove impossible.

For this purpose, I introduce the basic conformal anisotropic\nhydrodynamics formalism and then explain the ways we included realistic\nfeatures (bulk degree of freedom, quasiparticle implementation of realistic\nequation of state, more realistic collisional kernel), to make it a suitable\nhydrodynamics model for studying the QGP generated in heavy-ion collisions. For\nverification of our model we have compared the evolution of model parameters\npredicted by aHydro and vHydro, with exact solution of the Boltzmann equation.\nHowever, the system is not conformal and the aHydro needed to be improved to\ninclude a realistic prescription for the equation of state which takes care of\nnon-ideal effect in the dynamics. I have then designed a novel method for\nimplementing the realistic equation of state (provided by lattice QCD) in the\naHydro formalism. This model, called the quasiparticle aHydro model, integrates\nthe non-conformal effects in the aHydro model. The non-conformal effects are\ndue to strong interactions of plasma constituents which leads to\ntemperature-dependence of the particles' effective mass in the system. Based on\nthe quasiparticle picture, we have developed the quasiparticle aHydro\n(aHydroQP) model. We have then compared the phenomenological predictions of the\naHydroQP model with experimental observations. Comparisons illustrate a high\nlevel of consistency between our model and the experimental data. Finally, I\nhave calculated the quark self-energy in an anisotropic QGP. The quark\nself-energy is important because it encodes the way quarks gain interactional\nmass while in the hot QGP.

Existing SLL methods are either\nregularization-based or instance-based, and the latter of which has achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance. This is because the latest instance-based methods\ncontain an explicit disambiguation operation that accurately picks up the\ngroundtruth label of each training example from its ambiguous candidate labels.\nHowever, such disambiguation operation does not fully consider the mutually\nexclusive relationship among different candidate labels, so the disambiguated\nlabels are usually generated in a nondiscriminative way, which is unfavorable\nfor the instance-based methods to obtain satisfactory performance. To address\nthis defect, we develop a novel regularization approach for instance-based\nsuperset label (RegISL) learning so that our instance-based method also\ninherits the good discriminative ability possessed by the regularization\nscheme. Specifically, we employ a graph to represent the training set, and\nrequire the examples that are adjacent on the graph to obtain similar labels.\nMore importantly, a discrimination term is proposed to enlarge the gap of\nvalues between possible labels and unlikely labels for every training example.\nAs a result, the intrinsic constraints among different candidate labels are\ndeployed, and the disambiguated labels generated by RegISL are more\ndiscriminative and accurate than those output by existing instance-based\nalgorithms. The experimental results on various tasks convincingly demonstrate\nthe superiority of our RegISL to other typical SLL methods in terms of both\ntraining accuracy and test accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 00:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-08"}

Inspired by Bayesian approaches to uncertainty estimation, the\nsampling probabilities are designed for effective detection of the\nadversarially corrupted inputs. Being modular, the novel detector of\nadversaries can be conveniently employed by any pre-trained DNN at no extra\ntraining overhead. Selecting which units to sample per hidden layer entails\nquantifying the amount of DNN output uncertainty, where the overall uncertainty\nis expressed in terms of its layer-wise components - what also promotes\nscalability.

At the beginning of the single-processor cup game, $n$ cups are\ninitially empty. In each step of the game, a filler distributes $1$ unit of\nwater among the cups, and then an emptier selects a cup and removes $1 +\n\\epsilon$ units from that cup. The goal of the emptier is to minimize the\namount of water in the fullest cup, also known as the backlog. It is known that\nthe greedy algorithm (i.e., empty the fullest cup) achieves backlog $O(\\log\nn)$, and that no deterministic algorithm can do better. We show that the\nperformance of the greedy algorithm can be greatly improved with a small amount\nof randomization: After any step $i$, and for any $k \\ge \\Omega(\\log\n\\epsilon^{-1})$, the emptier achieves backlog at most $O(k)$ with probability\nat least $1 -O(2^{-2^k})$.

In this paper, we report a new measurement of the\nelectron extraction efficiency (EEE) in a small xenon detector using two\nmono-energetic decay features of $^{37}$Ar. By achieving stable operation at\nvery high voltages, we measured the EEE values at the highest extraction\nelectric field strength reported to date.

Learned from the lesson of the conventional\nvideo coding, a B-frame coding structure is incorporated in our BP-DVC Net.\nWhile the bi-predictive coding in the conventional video codecs requires to\ntransmit to decoder sides the motion vectors for block motion and the residues\nfrom prediction, our BP-DVC Net incorporates optical flow estimation networks\nin both encoder and decoder sides so as not to transmit the motion information\nto the decoder sides for coding efficiency improvement.

Prior works have either relied on ad hoc methods to\ndetermine the level of layer sharing, which is suboptimal, or utilized neural\narchitecture search techniques to establish the network design, which is\nconsiderably expensive. In this paper, we go beyond these limitations and\npropose an approach to automatically construct branched multi-task networks, by\nleveraging the employed tasks' affinities.

Among various vertex clustering approaches,\nspectral clustering is one of the most popular methods because it is easy to\nimplement while often outperforming more traditional clustering algorithms.\nHowever, there are two inherent model selection problems in spectral\nclustering, namely estimating both the embedding dimension and number of\nclusters. This paper attempts to address the issue by establishing a novel\nmodel selection framework specifically for vertex clustering on graphs under a\nstochastic block model. The first contribution is a probabilistic model which\napproximates the distribution of the extended spectral embedding of a graph.\nThe model is constructed based on a theoretical result of asymptotic normality\nof the informative part of the embedding, and on a simulation result providing\na conjecture for the limiting behavior of the redundant part of the embedding.\nThe second contribution is a simultaneous model selection framework. In\ncontrast with the traditional approaches, our model selection procedure\nestimates embedding dimension and number of clusters simultaneously. Based on\nour conjectured distributional model, a theorem on the consistency of the\nestimates of model parameters is presented, providing support for the validity\nof our method.

Like edges, corners, blobs and\nother feature detectors, the proposed detector scans for feature points all\nover the image, for which the convolution is naturally suited.

However, due\nto the inherent non-convex and non-smooth structure of the zero-one loss\nfunction of the classification model, various convex surrogate loss functions\nsuch as hinge loss, squared hinge loss, logistic loss, and exponential loss are\nintroduced. These loss functions have been used for decades in diverse\nclassification models, such as SVM (support vector machine) with hinge loss,\nlogistic regression with logistic loss, and Adaboost with exponential loss and\nso on. In this work, we present a Perceptron-augmented convex classification\nframework, {\\it Logitron}. The loss function of it is a smoothly stitched\nfunction of the extended logistic loss with the famous Perceptron loss\nfunction. The extended logistic loss function is a parameterized function\nestablished based on the extended logarithmic function and the extended\nexponential function. The main advantage of the proposed Logitron\nclassification model is that it shows the connection between SVM and logistic\nregression via polynomial parameterization of the loss function. In more\ndetails, depending on the choice of parameters, we have the Hinge-Logitron\nwhich has the generalized $k$-th order hinge-loss with an additional $k$-th\nroot stabilization function and the Logistic-Logitron which has a logistic-like\nloss function with relatively large $|k|$. Interestingly, even $k=-1$,\nHinge-Logitron satisfies the classification-calibration condition and shows\nreasonable classification performance with low computational cost. The\nnumerical experiment in the linear classifier framework demonstrates that\nHinge-Logitron with $k=4$ (the fourth-order SVM with the fourth root\nstabilization function) outperforms logistic regression, SVM, and other\nLogitron models in terms of classification accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 09:39:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-08"}

The main question is to establish technical guarantees of\nconsistent recovery of the subgraph of probed network nodes, i) despite the\npresence of unobserved nodes; and ii) under different connectivity regimes,\nincluding the dense regime where the probed nodes are influenced by many\nconnections coming from the unobserved ones. We ascertain that suitable\nestimators of the combination matrix (i.e., the matrix that quantifies the\npairwise interaction between nodes) possess an identifiability gap that enables\nthe discrimination between connected and disconnected nodes. Fundamental\nconditions are established under which the subgraph of monitored nodes can be\nrecovered, with high probability as the network size increases, through\nuniversal clustering algorithms.

A detailed characterization of the\nasymptotic behavior of these estimators is established in terms of an error\nbias and of the identifiability gap, and a sample complexity analysis is\nperformed to establish how the number of samples scales with the network size\nto achieve consistent learning. Comparison among the estimators is performed\nthrough illustrative examples that show how estimators that are not optimal in\nthe full observability regime can outperform the Granger estimator in the\npartial observability regime.

Here we\nuse a nonlinear response theory based on a generalized Kubo formula to explain\nthe frequency up-conversion in topological materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 10:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-29"}

With the benefits of the Predictive\nState Representations~(PSRs) approach for state representation and model\nprediction, in this paper, we introduce an approach for planning from scratch,\nwhere an offline PSR model is firstly learned and then combined with online\nMonte-Carlo tree search for planning with model uncertainty. By comparing with\nthe state-of-the-art approach of planning with model uncertainty, we\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approaches along with the proof\nof their convergence. The effectiveness and scalability of our proposed\napproach are also tested on the RockSample problem, which are infeasible for\nthe state-of-the-art BA-POMDP based approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 11:57:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-08"}

A subclass of the multitude of the available parameterization\nalgorithms are those based on the principles of Elliptic Grid Generation (EGG)\nwhich, in their most basic form, attempt to approximate a mapping operator\nwhose inverse is composed of harmonic functions. The main challenge lies in\nfinding a formulation of the problem that is suitable for a computational\napproach and a common strategy is to approximate the mapping operator by means\nof solving a PDE-problem. PDE-based EGG is well-established in classical\nmeshing and first generalization attempts to spline-based descriptions (as is\nmandatory in IgA) have been made. Unfortunately, all of the practically viable\nPDE-based approaches impose certain requirements on the employed spline-basis,\nin particular global $C^{\\geq 1}$-continuity. This paper discusses a PDE-based\nEGG-algorithm for the generation of planar parameterizations with arbitrary\ncontinuity properties (where arbitrary stands for spline bases with global\n$C^{\\geq 0}$-continuity). A major use case of the proposed algorithm is that of\nmulti-patch parameterization, made possible by the support of $C^{\\geq\n0}$-continuities. This paper proposes a specially-taylored solution algorithm\nthat exploits many characteristics of the PDE-problem and is suitable for\nlarge-scale applications.

Objective: First, explore the\nfeasibility of applying deep learning models to detect smells without extensive\nfeature engineering, just by feeding the source code in tokenized form. Second,\ninvestigate the possibility of applying transfer-learning in the context of\ndeep learning models for smell detection. Method: We use existing metric-based\nstate-of-the-art methods for detecting three implementation smells and one\ndesign smell in C# code. Using these results as the annotated gold standard, we\ntrain smell detection models on three different deep learning architectures.\nThese architectures use Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) of one or two\ndimensions, or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) as their principal hidden\nlayers.

However, the definition of 'new or enlarged'\nis not fixed, and it is known that lesion-counting is highly subjective, with\nhigh degree of inter- and intra-rater variability. Automated methods for lesion\nquantification hold the potential to make the detection of new and enlarged\nlesions consistent and repeatable.

Instead, we propose a method for identifying lesion\nchanges of high certainty, and establish on a dataset of longitudinal multiple\nsclerosis cases that this method is able to separate progressive from stable\ntimepoints with a very high level of discrimination (AUC = 0.99), while changes\nin lesion volume are much less able to perform this separation (AUC = 0.71).\nValidation of the method on a second external dataset confirms that the method\nis able to generalize beyond the setting in which it was trained, achieving an\naccuracy of 83% in separating stable and progressive timepoints. Both lesion\nvolume and count have previously been shown to be strong predictors of disease\ncourse across a population.

The effectiveness in reducing\ncommunication thus strongly depends on the quality of the prediction model. In\nthis article, we propose event-triggered learning as a novel concept to reduce\ncommunication even further and to also adapt to changing dynamics. By\nmonitoring the actual communication rate and comparing it to the one that is\ninduced by the model, we detect a mismatch between model and reality and\ntrigger model learning when needed.

For\ninstance, when a smaller subcluster falls into the gravitational potential of a\nmore massive cluster, a bow shock is formed and moves together with the\nsubcluster. After pericenter passage, however, the subcluster is decelerated by\nthe gravity of the main cluster, while the shock continues moving away from the\ncluster center. These shocks are considered as promising candidates for\npowering radio relics found in many clusters. The aim of this paper is to\nexplore the fate of such shocks when they travel to the cluster outskirts, far\nfrom the place where the shocks were initiated. In a uniform medium, such a\n\"runaway\" shock should weaken with distance. However, as shocks move to large\nradii in galaxy clusters, the shock is moving down a steep density gradient\nthat helps the shock to maintain its strength over a large distance.\nObservations and numerical simulations show that, beyond $R_{500}$, gas density\nprofiles are as steep as, or steeper than, $\\sim r^{-3}$, suggesting that there\nexists a \"Habitable zone\" for moderately strong shocks in cluster outskirts\nwhere the shock strength can be maintained or even amplified. A characteristic\nfeature of runaway shocks is that the strong compression, relative to the\ninitial state, is confined to a narrow region just behind the shock. Therefore,\nif such a shock runs over a region with a pre-existing population of\nrelativistic particles, then the boost in radio emissivity, due to pure\nadiabatic compression, will also be confined to a narrow radial shell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 13:22:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 12:40:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

Here we investigate, by means of density functional theory\ncalculation, anion vacancies at the TaON-terminated (001) surface of the\nperovskite oxynitride SrTaO$_2$N. We find an energetic preference for oxygen\nand nitrogen vacancies to reside at the surface, where they are spontaneously\nhealed by *O and *OH adsorbates under OER conditions. For nitrogen vacancies,\nthis self-healing leads to an altered stoichiometry Ta$_4$O$_{8+x}$N$_{4-x}$\nthat is accompanied by electron doping. Substitution of N by O at the surface\nalso leads to tensile strain, which confines the excess charge to the very\nsurface layer, affecting the binding energy of reaction intermediates and\nsignificantly increasing the OER overpotential.

This\nsubstantially complicates construction of an accurate model for such systems\nusing data-driven approaches. The present paper illustrates how physical\nconstraints can be employed to overcome this limitation using the example of a\nweakly turbulent quasi-two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow driven by a steady\nLorenz force with an unknown spatial profile. Specifically, the terms involving\nlatent variables in the partial differential equations governing the dynamics\ncan be eliminated at the expense of raising the order of that equation. We show\nthat local polynomial interpolation combined with symbolic regression can\nhandle sparse data on grids that are representative of typical experimental\nmeasurement techniques such as particle image velocimetry.

The PAF describes the attributable risk\ndue to an exposure and is often interpreted as the proportion of preventable\ncases if the exposure could be extinct. Difficulties in the definition and\ninterpretation of the PAF arise when the exposure of interest depends on time.\nThen, the definition of exposed and unexposed individuals is not\nstraightforward. We propose dynamic prediction and landmarking to define and\nestimate a PAF in this data situation. Two estimands are discussed which are\nbased on two hypothetical interventions that could prevent the exposure in\ndifferent ways. Considering the first estimand, at each landmark the estimation\nproblem is reduced to a time-independent setting. Then, estimation is simply\nperformed by using a generalized-linear model accounting for the current\nexposure state and further (time-varying) covariates. The second estimand is\nbased on counterfactual outcomes, estimation can be performed using\npseudo-values or inverse-probability weights. The approach is explored in a\nsimulation study and applied on two data examples. First, we study a large\nFrench database of intensive care unit patients to estimate the\npopulation-benefit of a pathogen-specific intervention that could prevent\nventilator-associated pneumonia caused by the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\nMoreover, we quantify the population-attributable burden of locoregional and\ndistant recurrence in breast cancer patients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 14:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-22"}
