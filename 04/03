A stochastic directional distance function\n(SDDF) allows for noise in potentially all input and output variables. Yet,\nwhen estimated, the direction selected will affect the functional estimates\nbecause deviations from the estimated function are minimized in the specified\ndirection. The set of identified parameters of a parametric SDDF can be\nnarrowed via data-driven approaches to restrict the directions considered. We\ndemonstrate a similar narrowing of the identified parameter set for a shape\nconstrained nonparametric method, where the shape constraints impose standard\nfeatures of a cost function such as monotonicity and convexity.\n  Our Monte Carlo simulation studies reveal significant improvements, as\nmeasured by out of sample radial mean squared error, in functional estimates\nwhen we use a directional distance function with an appropriately selected\ndirection. From our Monte Carlo simulations we conclude that selecting a\ndirection that is approximately orthogonal to the estimated function in the\ncentral region of the data gives significantly better estimates relative to the\ndirections commonly used in the literature. For practitioners, our results\nimply that selecting a direction vector that has non-zero components for all\nvariables that may have measurement error provides a significant improvement in\nthe estimator's performance. We illustrate these results using cost and\nproduction data from samples of approximately 500 US hospitals per year\noperating in 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively, and find that the shape\nconstrained nonparametric methods provide a significant increase in flexibility\nover second order local approximation parametric methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 16:14:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2019 16:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-04"}

In the proposed approach, the\nspatial components of both magnetic and electric fields are located at zone\ninterfaces and are evolved using the constrained transport formalism. Direct\napplication of Stokes' theorem to Faraday's and Ampere's laws ensures that the\nresulting discretization is divergence-free for the magnetic field and\ncharge-conserving for the electric field. Hydrodynamic variables retain,\ninstead, the usual zone-centred representation commonly adopted in\nfinite-volume schemes. Temporal discretization is based on Runge-Kutta\nimplicit-explicit (IMEX) schemes in order to resolve the temporal scale\ndisparity introduced by the stiff source term in Ampere's law. The implicit\nstep is accomplished by means of an improved and more efficient Newton-Broyden\nmultidimensional root-finding algorithm. The explicit step relies on a\nmultidimensional Riemann solver to compute the line-averaged electric and\nmagnetic fields at zone edges and it employs a one-dimensional Riemann solver\nat zone interfaces to update zone-centred hydrodynamic quantities. For the\nlatter, we introduce a five-wave solver based on the frozen limit of the\nrelaxation system whereby the solution to the Riemann problem can be decomposed\ninto an outer Maxwell solver and an inner hydrodynamic solver. A number of\nnumerical benchmarks demonstrate that our method is superior in stability and\nrobustness to the more popular charge-conserving divergence cleaning approach\nwhere both primary electric and magnetic fields are zone-centered.

After evaluating the equivalence and the computation performance of\nthese two optimization engines, one preferred optimization engine was selected\nfor the gMCO algorithm. Five hundred sixty-two previously treated prostate HDR\ncases were divided into validation set (100) and test set (462). In the\nvalidation set, the number of Pareto optimal plans to achieve the best plan\nquality was determined for the gMCO algorithm. In the test set, gMCO plans were\ncompared with the physician-approved clinical plans.\n  Over 462 cases, the number of clinically valid plans was 428 (92.6%) for\nclinical plans and 461 (99.8%) for gMCO plans. The number of valid plans with\ntarget V100 coverage greater than 95% was 288 (62.3%) for clinical plans and\n414 (89.6%) for gMCO plans. The mean planning time was 9.4 s for the gMCO\nalgorithm to generate 1000 Pareto optimal plans.\n  In conclusion, gL-BFGS is able to compute thousands of SA equivalent\ntreatment plans within a short time frame. Powered by gL-BFGS, an ultra-fast\nand robust multi-criteria optimization algorithm was implemented for HDR\nprostate brachytherapy. A large-scale comparison against physician approved\nclinical plans showed that treatment plan quality could be improved and\nplanning time could be significantly reduced with the proposed gMCO algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 17:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

The coloring\nproblem on undirected graphs has been well studied, whereas there are very few\nresults for coloring problems on directed graphs. An oriented k-coloring of an\noriented graph G=(V,A) is a partition of the vertex set V into k independent\nsets such that all the arcs linking two of these subsets have the same\ndirection. The oriented chromatic number of an oriented graph G is the smallest\nk such that G allows an oriented k-coloring. Deciding whether an acyclic\ndigraph allows an oriented 4-coloring is NP-hard. It follows, that finding the\nchromatic number of an oriented graph is an NP-hard problem. This motivates to\nconsider the problem on oriented co-graphs. After giving several\ncharacterizations for this graph class, we show a linear time algorithm which\ncomputes an optimal oriented coloring for an oriented co-graph. We further\nprove how the oriented chromatic number can be computed for the disjoint union\nand order composition from the oriented chromatic number of the involved\noriented co-graphs.

Specifically, the analytic expressions for\nquantum phase distributions and angular $Q$ distribution as well as measures of\nquantum phase fluctuation and phase dispersion are obtained. The uniform phase\ndistribution of the initial Fock states is observed to be transformed by the\nunitary operation (i.e., displacement operator) into non-Gaussian shape, except\nfor the initial vacuum state. It is observed that the phase distribution is\nsymmetric with respect to the phase of the displacement parameter and becomes\nprogressively narrower as its amplitude increases.

While linear\npolarisation of dust and molecular lines can give insight into the magnetic\nfield structure, only observations of the circular polarisation produced by\nZeeman splitting provide a direct measurement of magnetic field strenghts. One\nof the most promising probes of magnetic field strengths is the paramagnetic\nradical CN. Here we present the first Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter\nArray (ALMA) observations of the Zeeman splitting of CN in the disc of TW~Hya.\nThe observations indicate an excellent polarisation performance of ALMA, but\nfail to detect significant polarisation. An analysis of eight individual CN\nhyperfine components as well as a stacking analysis of the strongest\n(non-blended) hyperfine components yields the most stringent limits obtained so\nfar on the magnetic field strength in a proto-planetary disc.

In both examples, the underlying regression functions have\ndiscontinuities, so many of the existing design optimization approaches cannot\nbe applied because they mostly assume a continuous regression function.\nAlthough some existing adaptive design strategies developed from treed\nregression models can handle the discontinuities, the Bayesian approaches come\nwith computationally expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for\nposterior inferences and subsequent design point selections, which is not\nappropriate for the first motivating example that requires computation at least\nfaster than the original imaging speed. In addition, the treed models are based\non the domain partitioning that are inefficient when the discontinuities occurs\nover complex sub-domain boundaries. We propose a simple and effective adaptive\ndesign strategy for a regression analysis with discontinuities: some\nstatistical properties with a fixed design will be presented first, and then\nthese properties will be used to propose a new criterion of selecting the\ndesign points for the regression analysis. Sequential design with the new\ncriterion will be presented with comprehensive simulated examples, and its\napplication to the two motivating examples will be presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 20:14:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 13:01:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 19:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 20:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

In this paper, we present a scoping review of existing clinical\nNLP literature for cancer. Methods: We identified studies describing an NLP\nmethod to extract specific cancer-related information from EHR sources from\nPubMed, Google Scholar, ACL Anthology, and existing reviews. Two exclusion\ncriteria were used in this study. We excluded articles where the extraction\ntechniques used were too broad to be represented as frames and also where very\nlow-level extraction methods were used. 79 articles were included in the final\nreview. We organized this information according to frame semantic principles to\nhelp identify common areas of overlap and potential gaps. Results: Frames were\ncreated from the reviewed articles pertaining to cancer information such as\ncancer diagnosis, tumor description, cancer procedure, breast cancer diagnosis,\nprostate cancer diagnosis and pain in prostate cancer patients. These frames\nincluded both a definition as well as specific frame elements (i.e. extractable\nattributes). We found that cancer diagnosis was the most common frame among the\nreviewed papers (36 out of 79), with recent work focusing on extracting\ninformation related to treatment and breast cancer diagnosis. Conclusion: The\nlist of common frames described in this paper identifies important\ncancer-related information extracted by existing NLP techniques and serves as a\nuseful resource for future researchers requiring cancer information extracted\nfrom EHR notes. We also argue, due to the heavy duplication of cancer NLP\nsystems, that a general purpose resource of annotated cancer frames and\ncorresponding NLP tools would be valuable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 20:27:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-04"}

Employing a simplified neutrino heating-cooling scheme in the Prometheus\nhydrodynamics module allows us to sample the angular resolution between 4\ndegrees and 0.5 degrees. With a newly-implemented static mesh refinement (SMR)\ntechnique on the Yin-Yang grid, the angular coordinates can be refined in\nconcentric shells, compensating for the diverging structure of the spherical\ngrid. In contrast to previous studies with Prometheus and other codes, we find\nthat higher angular resolution and therefore lower numerical viscosity provides\nmore favorable explosion conditions and faster shock expansion. We discuss the\npossible reasons for the discrepant results. The overall dynamics seem to\nconverge at a resolution of about 1 degree. Applying the SMR setup to\nmarginally exploding progenitors is disadvantageous for the shock expansion,\nhowever, because kinetic energy of downflows is dissipated to internal energy\nat resolution interfaces, leading to a loss of turbulent pressure support and a\nsteeper temperature gradient. We also present a way to estimate the numerical\nviscosity on grounds of the measured turbulent kinetic-energy spectrum, leading\nto smaller values that are better compatible with the flow behavior witnessed\nin our simulations than results following calculations in previous literature.\nInterestingly, the numerical Reynolds numbers in the turbulent, neutrino-heated\npostshock layer (some 10 to several 100) are in the ballpark of expected\nneutrino-drag effects on the relevant length scales in the turbulent postshock\nlayer.

(2018b) (Paper I) and Coughlin et al. (2019) (Paper II)\ndescribe a weak and infinitely weak shock (the latter being a rarefaction\nwave). We find that shocks, no matter their initial strengths, evolve toward\neither the infinitely strong or infinitely weak self-similar solutions at\nsufficiently late times. For a given density profile, a single function\ncharacterizes the long-term evolution of a shock's radius and strength.\nHowever, shocks with strengths near the self-similar solution for a weak shock\n(from Paper I) evolve extremely slowly with time. Therefore, the self-similar\nsolutions for infinitely strong and infinitely weak shocks are not likely to be\nrealized in low-energy stellar explosions, which will instead retain memory of\nthe shock strength initiated in the stellar interior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 23:27:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 23:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

As a result, the heterostructure\ndevices show superb characteristics, with a high current on-off ratio of around\n3 x 108, an average subthreshold slope of 126 mV per decade over five decades\nof current change due to band to band tunneling, an ultra-high rectification\nratio of around 3 x 108 and a current density of more than 104 A per cm2.\nFurther, a small signal half wave rectifier circuit based on majority carrier\ntransport dominated diode is successfully demonstrated, showing great potential\nin future high speed electronic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2019 02:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-04"}

Previous works mainly focused on finding the global\nminimizer to address the least-squares problem. However, existing works that\nshow the ability to achieve global minimizer are still unsuitable for real-time\napplications. Furthermore, as one of contributions of this paper, we prove that\nthere exist ambiguous configurations for any number of lines and planes.

In the second\nstage, we segment the original image by thresholding on the reflection part,\nand the inhomogeneous intensity is estimated by the smoothly varying\nillumination part.

A molecular cloud at a distance of\n3.2 kpc is spatially coincident with the western part of the SNR, and it is\nlikely hit by the SNR. The X-ray emission from this part of the shell is much\nlower than from the rest of the SNR. Moreover, a compact GeV emission region\ncoincident with the cloud has been detected with a soft spectrum. These\nobservations seem to imply a shock-cloud collision scenario at this area, where\nthe stalled shock can no longer accelerate super-TeV electrons or maintain\nstrong magnetic turbulence downstream, while the GeV cosmic rays (CRs) are\nreleased through this stalled shock. To test this hypothesis, we have performed\na detailed Fermi-LAT reanalysis of the HESS J1731-347 region with over 9 years\nof data. We find that the compact GeV emission region displays a spectral\npower-law index of -2.4, whereas the GeV emission from the rest of the SNR\n(excluding the cloud region) has an index of -1.8.

Our starting\npoint is the seminal work of Dwork et al. which introduced a notion of\nindividual fairness (IF): given a task-specific similarity metric, every pair\nof individuals who are similarly qualified according to the metric should\nreceive similar outcomes. We show that when individuals have diverse\npreferences over outcomes, requiring IF may unintentionally lead to\nless-preferred outcomes for the very individuals that IF aims to protect. A\nnatural alternative to IF is the classic notion of fair division, envy-freeness\n(EF): no individual should prefer another individual's outcome over their own.\nAlthough EF allows for solutions where all individuals receive a\nhighly-preferred outcome, EF may also be overly-restrictive. For instance, if\nmany individuals agree on the best outcome, then if any individual receives\nthis outcome, they all must receive it, regardless of each individual's\nunderlying qualifications for the outcome.\n  We introduce and study a new notion of preference-informed individual\nfairness (PIIF) that is a relaxation of both individual fairness and\nenvy-freeness. At a high-level, PIIF requires that outcomes satisfy IF-style\nconstraints, but allows for deviations provided they are in line with\nindividuals' preferences. We show that PIIF can permit outcomes that are more\nfavorable to individuals than any IF solution, while providing considerably\nmore flexibility to the decision-maker than EF.

The aim of the\npresent paper is to solve the ambiguity by comparing the ambiguous field\nvectors obtained in the same prominence observed on two consecutive days. The\neffect of the solar rotation is to modify the scattering angle of the\nprominence radiation, which modifies the symmetry of the ambiguous solutions.\nThis method, which is a kind of tomography, was successfully applied in the\npast to the average magnetic field vector of 20 prominences observed at the Pic\ndu Midi. The aim of the present paper is to apply this method to a prominence\nobserved with spatial resolution at the THEMIS telescope (European site at\nIzana, Tenerife Island). The magnetic field vector is measured by\ninterpretation of the Hanle effect observed in the He I D3 5875.6 A line,\nwithin the horizontal field vector hypothesis for simplicity. The ambiguity is\nfirst solved by comparing the two pairs of solutions obtained for a \"big pixel\"\ndetermined by averaging the observed Stokes parameters in a large region at the\nprominence centre. Each pixel is then disambiguated by selecting the closest\nsolution in a propagation from the prominence centre to the prominence\nboundary. The results previously obtained on averaged prominences are all\nrecovered. The polarity is found to be inverse with a small angle of about\n-21{\\deg} between the magnetic field vector and the long axis of the filament.\nThe magnetic field strength of about 6 G is found to slightly increase with\nheight, as previously observed. The new result is the observed decrease with\nheight, of the absolute value of the angle between the magnetic field vector\nand the long axis of the filament.

These models consume a huge amount of memory and computational\noperations. However, most of the large-scale industrial applications are often\ncomputational budget constrained. In practice, the peak workload of inference\nservice could be 10x higher than the average cases, with the presence of\nunpredictable extreme cases. Lots of computational resources could be wasted\nduring off-peak hours and the system may crash when the workload exceeds system\ncapacity. How to support deep learning services with a dynamic workload\ncost-efficiently remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we address the\nchallenge with a general and novel training scheme called model slicing, which\nenables deep learning models to provide predictions within the prescribed\ncomputational resource budget dynamically. Model slicing could be viewed as an\nelastic computation solution without requiring more computational resources.\nSuccinctly, each layer in the model is divided into groups of a contiguous\nblock of basic components (i.e. neurons in dense layers and channels in\nconvolutional layers), and then partially ordered relation is introduced to\nthese groups by enforcing that groups participated in each forward pass always\nstarts from the first group to the dynamically-determined rightmost group.\nTrained by dynamically indexing the rightmost group with a single parameter\nslice rate, the network is engendered to build up group-wise and residual\nrepresentation. Then during inference, a sub-model with fewer groups can be\nreadily deployed for efficiency whose computation is roughly quadratic to the\nwidth controlled by the slice rate. Extensive experiments show that models\ntrained with model slicing can effectively support on-demand workload with\nelastic inference cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2019 08:16:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 2019 08:49:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 07:06:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}

How much\ncrowdsourced data to sample and buy over time is a critical question for a\nplatform's AoI management, requiring a good balance between its AoI and the\nincurred sampling cost. This question becomes more interesting by considering\nthe stage after sampling, where multiple platforms coexist in sharing the\ncontent delivery network of limited bandwidth, and one platform's update may\njam or preempt the others' under negative network externalities. When these\nselfish platforms know each other's sampling cost, we formulate their\ncompetition as a non-cooperative game and show they want to over-sample to\nreduce their own AoIs, causing the price of anarchy (PoA) to be infinity. To\nremedy this huge efficiency loss, we propose a trigger mechanism of\nnon-monetary punishment in a repeated game to enforce the platforms'\ncooperation to approach the social optimum. We also study the more challenging\nscenario of incomplete information that some new platform hides its private\nsampling cost information from the other incumbent platforms in the Bayesian\ngame. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that even the platform with more\ninformation may get hurt. We successfully redesign the trigger-and-punishment\nmechanism to negate the platform's information advantage and ensure no\ncheating. Our extensive simulations show that the mechanisms can remedy the\nhuge efficiency loss due to platform competition, and the performance improves\nas we have more incumbent platforms with known cost information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2019 08:27:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 2019 01:20:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 13:33:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 02:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-05"}

In spite of this attractive\nfeature, the thermal relaxation into the ground state displays remarkably slow\nglassy behavior. The question addressed in this paper is whether this planar\nembedding can afford an efficient path to solution of k-regular k-XORSAT via\nquantum adiabatic annealing. We first show that our model bypasses an avoided\nlevel crossing and consequent exponentially small gap in the limit of small\ntransverse fields.

From an experimental point of view, such systems are\nespecially suited to perform particle tracking easily, and, therefore, are a\nbenchmark for novel optical techniques, applicable when primary particles\ncannot be resolved. Differential Variance Analysis (DVA) is one such novel\ntechnique that simplifies significantly the characterization of structural\nrelaxation processes of soft glassy materials, since it is directly applicable\nto digital image sequences of the sample. DVA succeeds in monitoring not only\nthe average dynamics, but also its spatio-temporal fluctuations, known as\ndynamic heterogeneities. In this work, we study the dynamics of dense\nsuspensions of Brownian beads in water, imaged through digital\nvideo-microscopy, by using both DVA and single-particle tracking.

Since the groundtruth depth labels are hard to\nobtain, recent methods try to learn depth estimation networks in an\nunsupervised way by exploring unsupervised cues, which are effective but less\nreliable than true labels. An emerging way to resolve this dilemma is to\ntransfer knowledge from synthetic images with ground truth depth via domain\nadaptation techniques. However, these approaches overlook specific geometric\nstructure of the natural images in the target domain (i.e., real data), which\nis important for high-performing depth prediction.

This first result, originally presented in Brigo and Mercurio (1998,\n2000), is then connected with the recent work of Armstrong et al (2018, 2021),\nwhere using rough paths theory it is shown that implied volatility is\nassociated with a purely pathwise lift of the stock dynamics involving no\nprobability and no semimartingale theory in particular, leading to option\nmodels without probability.

This quantum superefficiency is however\nvery fragile to noise or decoherence, and typically disappears with any small\namount of random noise asymptotically at large $N$. To complement this\nasymptotic characterization, we characterize how the estimation efficiency\nevolves as a function of the size $N$ of the entangled system and its degree of\nentanglement. We address a generic situation of qubit phase estimation, also\nmeaningful for frequency estimation. Decoherence is represented by the broad\nclass of noises commuting with the phase rotation, which includes depolarizing,\nphase-flip, and thermal quantum noises. In these general conditions, explicit\nexpressions are derived for the quantum Fisher information quantifying the\nultimate achievable efficiency for estimation. We confront at any size $N$ the\nefficiency of the optimal separable preparation to that of an entangled\npreparation with arbitrary degree of entanglement. We exhibit the $1/N^2$\nsuperefficiency with no noise, and prove its asymptotic disappearance at large\n$N$ for any non-vanishing noise configuration. For maximizing the estimation\nefficiency, we characterize the existence of an optimum $N_{\\rm opt}$ of the\nsize of the entangled system along with an optimal degree of entanglement. For\nnonunital noises, maximum efficiency is usually obtained at partial\nentanglement. Grouping the $N$ qubits into independent blocks formed of $N_{\\rm\nopt}$ entangled qubits restores at large $N$ a nonvanishing efficiency that can\nimprove over that of $N$ independent qubits optimally prepared. One inactive\nqubit in the entangled probe sometimes is most efficient for estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2019 10:44:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-04"}

In case an evacuee experiences\nrepeated emergency scenarios which may be a false alarm (e.g., an evacuation\ndrill, a false bomb threat, etc.) or an actual threat, the Aesop's cry wolf\neffect (repeated false alarms decrease order compliance) can severely affect\nhis/her likelihood to evacuate. To analyse this key unsolved issue of\nevacuation research, a game-theoretic approach is proposed. Game theory is used\nto explore mutual best responses of an evacuee and an authority. In the\nproposed model the authority obtains a signal of whether there is a threat or\nnot and decides whether to order an evacuation or not. The evacuee, after\nreceiving an evacuation order, subsequently decides whether to stay or leave\nbased on posterior beliefs that have been updated in response to the\nauthority's action. Best-responses are derived and Sequential equilibrium and\nPerfect Bayesian Equilibrium are used as solution concepts (refining equilibria\nwith the intuitive criterion).

However, the intrinsic visual sparsity and large\nintra-class variance of the sketch make the learning of the conditional decoder\nmore difficult and hence achieve unsatisfactory retrieval performance. In this\npaper, we propose a novel stacked semantic-guided network to address the unique\ncharacteristics of sketches in ZS-SBIR. Specifically, we devise multi-layer\nfeature fusion networks that incorporate different intermediate feature\nrepresentation information in a deep neural network to alleviate the intrinsic\nsparsity of sketches. In order to improve visual knowledge transfer from seen\nto unseen classes, we elaborate a coarse-to-fine conditional decoder that\ngenerates coarse-grained category-specific corresponding features first (taking\nauxiliary semantic information as conditional input) and then generates\nfine-grained instance-specific corresponding features (taking sketch\nrepresentation as conditional input). Furthermore, regression loss and\nclassification loss are utilized to preserve the semantic and discriminative\ninformation of the synthesized features respectively.

Since two states that differ by a local gate have the same\nentanglement entropy, then the entanglement entropy defines a function in the\nquotient space. In this paper we study this equivalence relation on (i) the set\n$\\mathbb{R}\\hbox{Q}(3)$ of 3-qubit states with real amplitudes, (ii) the set\n$Q\\mathcal{C}$ of 3-qubit states that can be prepared with gates on the\nClifford group, and (iii) the set $Q\\mathbb{R}\\mathcal{C}$ of 3-qubit states in\n$Q\\mathcal{C}$ with real amplitudes. We show that the set $Q\\mathcal{C}$ has\n8460 states and the quotient space has 5 elements. We have\n$\\frac{Q\\mathcal{C}}{\\sim}=\\{S_{0},S_{2/3,1},S_{2/3,2},S_{2/3,3},S_{1}\\}$. As\nusual, we will call the elements in the quotient space, orbits. We have that\nthe orbit $S_0$ contains all the states that differ by a local gate with the\nstate $|000\\rangle$.

All the states in the orbits\n$S_{2/3,1},S_{2/3,2},S_{2/3,3}$ have entanglement entropy $2/3$ and each one of\nthese orbits has 1152 states.

We also study\nhow the controlled not gates $CNOT(1,2)$ and $CNOT(2,3)$ act on these orbits.\nFor example, we show that when we apply a $CNOT(1,2)$ to all the states in\n$S_0$, then 960 states go back to the same orbit $S_0$ and 768 states go to the\norbit $S_{2/3,1}$.

Our framework has three major\nadvantages over pre-existing methods, which are based on supervised or\nsemi-supervised classification. First, we do not require any prior labeling of\nusers: instead, we create clusters, which are much easier to label manually\nafterwards, e.g., in a matter of seconds or minutes instead of hours. Second,\nthere is no need for domain- or topic-level knowledge either to specify the\nrelevant stances (labels) or to conduct the actual labeling. Third, our\nframework is robust in the face of data skewness, e.g., when some users or some\nstances have greater representation in the data. We experiment with different\ncombinations of user similarity features, dataset sizes, dimensionality\nreduction methods, and clustering algorithms to ascertain the most effective\nand most computationally efficient combinations across three different datasets\n(in English and Turkish). We further verified our results on additional tweet\nsets covering six different controversial topics.

However, the computational cost of such $GW$\ncalculations for typical interfaces is significant, given their large system\nsize and chemical complexity. In the past, approximate self-energy corrections,\nsuch as those constructed from image-charge models together with gas-phase\nmolecular level corrections, have been used to compute level alignment with\ngood accuracy. However, these approaches often neglect dynamical effects of the\npolarizability and require the definition of an image plane. In this work, we\npropose a new approximation to enable more efficient $GW$-quality calculations\nof interfaces, where we greatly simplify the calculation of the non-interacting\npolarizability, a primary bottleneck for large heterogeneous systems. This is\nachieved by first computing the non-interacting polarizability of each\nindividual component of the interface, e.g., the molecule and the metal,\nwithout the use of large supercells; and then using folding and spatial\ntruncation techniques to efficiently combine these quantities. Overall this\napproach significantly reduces the computational cost for conventional $GW$\ncalculations of level alignment without sacrificing the accuracy. Moreover,\nthis approach captures both dynamical and nonlocal polarization effects without\nthe need to invoke a classical image-charge expression or to define an image\nplane. We demonstrate our approach by considering a model system of benzene at\nrelatively low coverage on aluminum (111) surface. Although developed for such\ninterfaces, the method can be readily extended to other heterogeneous\ninterfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2019 14:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-27"}

Assuming no wall effects, we derive an analytical\nexpression for a phoretic-lift which captures the modification to the inertial\nlift due to electrophoresis. We also take wall effects into account and find\nthat the analytical expression is valid away from the walls. We find that for a\nleading particle, the phoretic-lift acts towards the regions of high shear\n(i.e. walls), while the reverse is true for a lagging particle. Using an\norder-of-magnitude analysis, we obtain different components which contribute to\nthe inertial force and classify them on the basis of the interactions from\nwhich they emerge. We show that the dominant contribution to the phoretic-lift\noriginates from the interaction of slip-driven source-dipole field with the\nstresslet field (generated due to particle's resistance to strain in the\nbackground flow). Furthermore, to contrast the slip-driven phenomenon from a\nforce-driven phenomenon in terms of their influence on the inertial migration,\nwe also study a non-neutrally buoyant particle. We show that the gravitational\neffects alter the inertial lift primarily through the interaction of background\nshear with buoyancy induced stokeslet field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2019 14:23:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 12:06:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 9 Jun 2019 12:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-19"}

Its worst-case hardness lies at the core of computational\ncomplexity theory, for example in the form of NP-hardness and the (Strong)\nExponential Time Hypothesis. In practice however, SAT instances can often be\nsolved efficiently. This contradicting behavior has spawned interest in the\naverage-case analysis of SAT and has triggered the development of sophisticated\nrigorous and non-rigorous techniques for analyzing random structures.\n  Despite a long line of research and substantial progress, most theoretical\nwork on random SAT assumes a uniform distribution on the variables. In\ncontrast, real-world instances often exhibit large fluctuations in variable\noccurrence. This can be modeled by a non-uniform distribution of the variables,\nwhich can result in distributions closer to industrial SAT instances.\n  We study satisfiability thresholds of non-uniform random $2$-SAT with $n$\nvariables and $m$ clauses and with an arbitrary probability distribution\n$(p_i)_{i\\in[n]}$ with $p_1 \\ge p_2 \\ge \\ldots \\ge p_n > 0$ over the n\nvariables.

This space is Polish and has a rich semigroup structure for the\ngenealogy.

Our inspiration is the representation of\nBayes' rule as infinite-dimensional optimization problem (Csiszar, 1975;\nDonsker and Varadhan; 1975, Zellner; 1988). First, we use it to prove an\noptimality result of standard Variational Inference (VI): Under the proposed\nview, the standard Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) maximizing VI posterior is\npreferable to alternative approximations of the Bayesian posterior. Next, we\nargue for generalizing standard Bayesian inference. The need for this arises in\nsituations of severe misalignment between reality and three assumptions\nunderlying standard Bayesian inference: (1) Well-specified priors, (2)\nwell-specified likelihoods, (3) the availability of infinite computing power.\nOur generalization addresses these shortcomings with three arguments and is\ncalled the Rule of Three (RoT). We derive it axiomatically and recover existing\nposteriors as special cases, including the Bayesian posterior and its\napproximation by standard VI. In contrast, approximations based on alternative\nELBO-like objectives violate the axioms. Finally, we study a special case of\nthe RoT that we call Generalized Variational Inference (GVI).

Our results show that these\nhigher-order lensing statistics can display varying levels of sensitivity to\nbaryonic effects compared to the power spectrum, with the squeezed-bispectrum\nbeing the least sensitive. We also show that ignoring baryonic effects on\nlensing covariances slightly overestimates the error budget (and is therefore\nconservative from the point of view of parameter error bars) and likely has\nnegligible impact on parameter biases in inference analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2019 15:58:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 13:11:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-18"}

This\nproblem finds numerous applications on large-scale graphs. Recently, heat\nkernel PageRank (HKPR), which is a measure of the proximity of nodes in graphs,\nis applied to this problem and found to be more efficient compared with prior\nmethods. However, existing solutions for computing HKPR either are\nprohibitively expensive or provide unsatisfactory error approximation on HKPR\nvalues, rendering them impractical especially on billion-edge graphs.\n  In this paper, we present TEA and TEA+, two novel local graph clustering\nalgorithms based on HKPR, to address the aforementioned limitations.\nSpecifically, these algorithms provide non-trivial theoretical guarantees in\nrelative error of HKPR values and the time complexity.

We simulated sagittal extension and lateral flexion\nmild experimental head impacts performed on 10 subjects with relaxed or\ncocontracted muscles, and median American football head impacts. We estimated\nangular impulses from active muscle, passive muscle, and ligaments during head\nimpact acceleration and deceleration phases. During the acceleration phase,\nactive musculature produced resistive angular impulses that were 30% of the\nimpact angular impulse in experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. This\nwas reduced below 20% in football impacts. During the deceleration phase,\nactive musculature stabilized the head with 50% of the impact angular impulse\nin experimental impacts with cocontracted muscles. However, passive ligaments\nprovided greater stabilizing angular impulses in football impacts. The\nredistribution of stabilizing angular impulses results from ligament and muscle\ndependence on lengthening rate, where ligaments stiffen substantially compared\nto active muscle at high lengthening rates. Thus, ligaments provide relatively\ngreater deceleration impulses in these impacts, which limits the effectiveness\nof muscle strengthening or anticipated activations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 18:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-08"}

Our proposed approach outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art by 7.17% on root mean squared error (RMSE) and 8.08% on\nmean absolute error (MAE).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 21:18:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

The use of 3D data for plant\nphenomics is a recent phenomenon. However, since 3D point cloud contains more\ninformation than plant images, in this paper, we compare the performance of\ndifferent keypoint detectors and local feature descriptors combinations for the\nplant growth stage and it's growth condition classification based on 3D point\nclouds of the plants. We have also implemented a modified form of 3D SIFT\ndescriptor, that is invariant to rotation and is computationally less intense\nthan most of the 3D SIFT descriptors reported in the existing literature. The\nperformance is evaluated in terms of the classification accuracy and the\nresults are presented in terms of accuracy tables. We find the ISS-SHOT and the\nSIFT-SIFT combinations consistently perform better and Fisher Vector (FV) is a\nbetter encoder than Vector of Linearly Aggregated (VLAD) for such applications.\nIt can serve as a better modality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 19:58:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-19"}

In spite of advances in photogrammetry, remote sensing and computer\nvision, this task remains challenging due to object and data complexity. The\ndevelopment of object extraction approaches is promoted through publically\navailable benchmark datasets and evaluation frameworks. Many aspects of\nperformance evaluation have already been studied. This study collects the best\npractices from literature, puts the various aspects in one evaluation\nframework, and demonstrates its usefulness to a case study on mapping object\noutlines. The evaluation framework includes five dimensions: the robustness to\nchanges in resolution, input, location, parameters, and application. Examples\nfor investigating these dimensions are provided, as well as accuracy measures\nfor their qualitative analysis. The measures consist of time efficiency and a\nprocedure for line-based accuracy assessment regarding quantitative\ncompleteness and spatial correctness. The delineation approach to which the\nevaluation framework is applied, was previously introduced and is substantially\nimproved in this study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Apr 2019 07:08:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

In this paper, we study\nvarious neural network architectures and propose one that is hardware-friendly\nfor a neuromorphic hardware with crossbar array of synapses. Considering the\nhardware constraints, we demonstrate how one may design the neuromorphic\nhardware so as to maximize classification accuracy in the trained network\narchitecture, while concurrently, we choose a neural network architecture so as\nto maximize utilization in the neuromorphic cores. We also proposed a framework\nfor mapping a neural network onto a neuromorphic chip named as the Mapping and\nDebugging (MaD) framework.
