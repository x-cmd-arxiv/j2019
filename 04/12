In recent work, we conjectured that if $G$\nis nonamenable then the matrix of critical connection probabilities\n$T_{p_c}(u,v)=\\mathbb{P}_{p_c}(u\\leftrightarrow v)$ is bounded as an operator\n$T_{p_c}:L^2(V)\\to L^2(V)$ and proved that this conjecture holds for several\nclasses of graphs. We also noted in that work that the conjecture implies two\nolder conjectures, namely that percolation on transitive nonamenable graphs\nalways has a nontrivial nonuniqueness phase, and that critical percolation on\nthe same class of graphs has mean-field critical behaviour.\n  In this paper we further investigate the consequences of the $L^2$\nboundedness conjecture. In particular, we prove that the following hold for all\ntransitive graphs: i) The two-point function decays exponentially in the\ndistance for all $p<p_{2\\to 2}$; ii) If $p_c<p_{2\\to 2}$, then the critical\nexponent governing the extrinsic diameter of a critical cluster is $1$; iii)\nBelow $p_{2\\to 2}$, percolation is \"ballistic\" in the sense that the intrinsic\ndistance between two points is exponentially unlikely to be much larger than\ntheir extrinsic distance; iv) If $p_c<p_{2\\to 2}$, then $\\|T_{p_c}\\|_{q\\to q}\n\\asymp (q-1)^{-1}$ and $p_{q\\to q}-p_c \\asymp q-1$ as $q\\downarrow 1$. v) If\n$p_c<p_{2\\to 2}$, then various 'multiple-arm' events have probabilities\ncomparable to the upper bound given by the BK inequality. In particular, the\nprobability that the origin is a trifurcation point is of order $(p-p_c)^3$ as\n$p \\downarrow p_c$.

Classic stereo algorithms and prior\nlearning-based depth estimation techniques under-perform when applied on this\ndual-pixel data, the former due to too-strong assumptions about RGB image\nmatching, and the latter due to not leveraging the understanding of optics of\ndual-pixel image formation. To allow learning based methods to work well on\ndual-pixel imagery, we identify an inherent ambiguity in the depth estimated\nfrom dual-pixel cues, and develop an approach to estimate depth up to this\nambiguity. Using our approach, existing monocular depth estimation techniques\ncan be effectively applied to dual-pixel data, and much smaller models can be\nconstructed that still infer high quality depth. To demonstrate this, we\ncapture a large dataset of in-the-wild 5-viewpoint RGB images paired with\ncorresponding dual-pixel data, and show how view supervision with this data can\nbe used to learn depth up to the unknown ambiguities.

To\ngrapple with these problems and to define effective resource management\nsolutions for their services, providers often must expend significant efforts\nand incur prohibitive costs in developing performance models of their services\nunder a variety of interference scenarios on different hardware. This is a hard\nproblem due to the wide range of possible co-located services and their\nworkloads, and the growing heterogeneity in the runtime platforms including the\nuse of fog and edge-based resources, not to mention the accidental complexity\nin performing application profiling under a variety of scenarios. To address\nthese challenges, we present FECBench, a framework to guide providers in\nbuilding performance interference prediction models for their services without\nincurring undue costs and efforts. The contributions of the paper are as\nfollows. First, we developed a technique to build resource stressors that can\nstress multiple system resources all at once in a controlled manner to gain\ninsights about the interference on an application's performance.

The idea is that each road side unit (RSU) issues a signed\ntime-stamped tag as a proof for the vehicle's anonymous location. Proofs sent\nfrom multiple consecutive RSUs is used to create vehicle trajectory which is\nused as vehicle anonymous identity. Also, one RSU is not able to issue\ntrajectories for vehicles, rather the contributions of several RSUs are needed.\nBy this way, attackers need to compromise an infeasible number of RSUs to\ncreate fake trajectories. Moreover, upon receiving the proof of location from\nan RSU, the vehicle should solve a computational puzzle by running proof of\nwork (PoW) algorithm. So, it should provide a valid solution (proof of work) to\nthe next RSU before it can obtain a proof of location. Using the PoW can\nprevent the vehicles from creating multiple trajectories in case of low-dense\nRSUs. Then, during any reported event, e.g., road congestion, the event manager\nuses a matching technique to identify the trajectories sent from Sybil\nvehicles. The scheme depends on the fact that the Sybil trajectories are\nbounded physically to one vehicle; therefore, their trajectories should\noverlap. Extensive experiments and simulations demonstrate that our scheme\nachieves high detection rate to Sybil attacks with low false negative and\nacceptable communication and computation overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-12"}

The main\nbottleneck of a monolithic approach is that it requires solution of large\nlinear systems that result from the discretization and linearization of the\ngoverning balance equations.

The Markov\nbranching process corresponds to the genealogical description of prolific\nindividuals, that is individuals who produce eternal genealogical lines of\ndecent, and is often referred to as the skeleton or backbone of the original\nsuperprocess. The Poissonian dressing along the skeleton may be considered to\nbe the remaining non-prolific genealogical mass in the superprocess. Such\nskeletal decompositions are equally well understood for continuous-state\nbranching processes (CSBP). In a previous article, [16], we developed an SDE\napproach to study the skeletal representation of CSBPs, which provided a common\nframework for the skeletal decompositions of supercritical and (sub)critical\nCSBPs. It also helped us to understand how the skeleton thins down onto one\ninfinite line of descent when conditioning on survival until larger and larger\ntimes, and eventually forever.

Every stable matching is a min-size\npopular matching. Unfortunately, when there are edge costs, it is NP-hard to\nfind a popular matching of minimum cost -- even worse, the min-cost popular\nmatching problem is hard to approximate up to any factor.\n  Let opt be the cost of a min-cost popular matching. Our goal is to\nefficiently compute a matching of cost at most opt by paying the price of\nmildly relaxing popularity. Our main positive results are two bi-criteria\nalgorithms that find in polynomial time a near-popular or quasi-popular\nmatching of cost at most opt. Moreover, one of the algorithms finds a\nquasi-popular matching of cost at most that of a min-cost popular fractional\nmatching, which could be much smaller than opt.\n  Key to the other algorithm is a polynomial-size extended formulation for an\nintegral polytope sandwiched between the popular and quasi-popular matching\npolytopes.

The Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE) is the combined probability\nthat a photon is absorbed in the active volume of the device with a\nsubsequently triggered avalanche. Absorption and avalanche triggering\nprobabilities are correlated since the latter probability depends on where the\nphoton is absorbed. In this paper, we introduce a physics motivated\nparameterization of the avalanche triggering probability that describes the PDE\nof a SiPM as a function of its reverse bias voltage, at different wavelengths.\nThis parameterization is based on the fact that in p-on-n SiPMs the induced\navalanches are electron-driven in the ultra-violet and near-ultra-violet\nranges, while they become increasingly hole-driven towards the near-infra-red\nrange. The model has been successfully applied to characterize two Hamamatsu\nMPPCs and one FBK SiPM, and it can be extended to other SiPMs. Furthermore,\nthis model provides key insight on the electric field structure within SiPMs,\nwhich can explain the limitation of existing devices and be used to optimize\nthe performance of future SiPMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 22:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

Therefore, the use of\nparallel-in-time integration schemes to reduce the time-to-solution is of\nincreasing interest, particularly in the numerical weather forecasting field.\nWe present a multi-level parallel-in-time integration method combining the\nParallel Full Approximation Scheme in Space and Time (PFASST) with a spatial\ndiscretization based on Spherical Harmonics (SH). The iterative algorithm\ncomputes multiple time steps concurrently by interweaving parallel high-order\nfine corrections and serial corrections performed on a coarsened problem. To do\nthat, we design a methodology relying on the spectral basis of the SH to\ncoarsen and interpolate the problem in space. The methods are evaluated on the\nshallow-water equations on the sphere using a set of tests commonly used in the\natmospheric flow community.

The effect is uncertainty as to which technical offerings\nadequately match expectations expressed in legal standards. The uncertainty is\nexacerbated by a litany of successful privacy attacks, demonstrating that\ntraditional statistical disclosure limitation techniques often fall short of\nthe sort of privacy envisioned by legal standards.\n  We define predicate singling out, a new type of privacy attack intended to\ncapture the concept of singling out appearing in the General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR). Informally, an adversary predicate singles out a dataset $X$\nusing the output of a data release mechanism $M(X)$ if it manages to find a\npredicate $p$ matching exactly one row $x \\in X$ with probability much better\nthan a statistical baseline. A data release mechanism that precludes such\nattacks is secure against predicate singling out (PSO secure).\n  We argue that PSO security is a mathematical concept with legal consequences.\nAny data release mechanism that purports to \"render anonymous\" personal data\nunder the GDPR must be secure against singling out, and hence must be PSO\nsecure. We then analyze PSO security, showing that it fails to self-compose.\nNamely, a combination of $\\omega(\\log n)$ exact counts, each individually PSO\nsecure, enables an attacker to predicate single out. In fact, the composition\nof just two PSO-secure mechanisms can fail to provide PSO security.\n  Finally, we ask whether differential privacy and $k$-anonymity are PSO\nsecure. Leveraging a connection to statistical generalization, we show that\ndifferential privacy implies PSO security.

To achieve high network\nperformance, designing a scheduling function (SF) to properly dispatch requests\nfrom each switch to suitable controllers becomes critical. However, existing\nliterature tends to design the SF targeted at specific network settings. In\nthis paper, a reinforcement-learning-based (RL) approach is proposed with the\naim to automatically learn a general, effective, and efficient SF. In\nparticular, a new dispatching system is introduced in which the SF is\nrepresented as a neural network that determines the priority of each\ncontroller. Based on the priorities, a controller is selected using our\nproposed probability selection scheme to balance the trade-off between\nexploration and exploitation during learning. In order to train a general SF,\nwe first formulate the scheduling function design problem as an RL problem.\nThen a new training approach is developed based on a state-of-the-art deep RL\nalgorithm. Our simulation results show that our RL approach can rapidly design\n(or learn) SFs with optimal performance. Apart from that, the trained SF can\ngeneralize well and outperforms commonly used scheduling heuristics under\nvarious network settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 05:23:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

For pathological\ndiagnosis of cancer subtypes, pathologists usually change the magnification of\nwhole-slide images (WSI) viewers. A key assumption is that the importance of\nthe magnifications depends on the characteristics of the input image, such as\ncancer subtypes. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic segmentation\nmethod, called Adaptive-Weighting-Multi-Field-of-View-CNN (AWMF-CNN), that can\nadaptively use image features from images with different magnifications to\nsegment multiple cancer subtype regions in the input image. The proposed method\naggregates several expert CNNs for images of different magnifications by\nadaptively changing the weight of each expert depending on the input image. It\nleverages information in the images with different magnifications that might be\nuseful for identifying the subtypes.

Blazar astrophysics is\nbecoming increasingly data driven, depending on the integration and combined\nanalysis of large quantities of data from the entire span of observational\nastrophysics techniques. The project was therefore chosen as one of the pilot\nactivities within the United Nations Open Universe Initiative. In this work we\ndeveloped a data analysis pipeline called Swift_deepsky, based on the Swift\nXRTDAS software and the XIMAGE package, encapsulated into a Docker container.\nSwift_deepsky, downloads and reads low-level data, generates higher-level\nproducts, detects X-ray sources and estimates several intensity and spectral\nparameters for each detection, thus facilitating the generation of complete and\nup-to-date science-ready catalogues from an entire space-mission dataset. The\nDocker version of the pipeline and its derived products is publicly available\nfrom the Open Universe Website at openuniverse.asi.it.

All the results can be accessed on-line in a variety of ways: e.g.,\nfrom the Open Universe portal at openuniverse.asi.it, through Virtual\nObservatory services, via the VOU-Blazar tool and the SSDC SED builder. One of\nthe most innovative aspects of this work is that the results can be safely\nreproduced and extended by anyone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 05:44:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 06:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

However, studies concerning the traffic\ndynamics of bicycle flow are very limited. This study experimentally\ninvestigated bicycle flow dynamics on a wide road, modeled using a 3-m-wide\ntrack. The results showed that the bicycle flow rate remained nearly constant\nacross a wide range of densities, in marked contrast to single-file bicycle\nflow, which exhibits a unimodal fundamental diagram. By studying the weight\ndensity of the radial locations of cyclists, we argue that this behavior arises\nfrom the formation of more lanes with the increase of global density. The extra\nlanes prevent the longitudinal density from increasing as quickly as in\nsingle-file bicycle flow. When the density is larger than 0.5 bicycles/m2, the\nflow rate begins to decrease, and stop-and-go traffic emerges. A\ncognitive-science-based model to reproduce bicycle dynamics is proposed, in\nwhich cyclists apply simple cognitive procedures to adapt their target\ndirections and desired riding speeds. To incorporate differences in\nacceleration, deceleration, and turning, different relaxation times are used.\nThe model can reproduce the experimental results acceptably well and may also\nprovide guidance on infrastructure design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 07:52:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-15"}

Recently, a deep-learning-based image-to-image translation\ntechnique to translate an image from a source domain to a desired domain was\npresented, and cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN) was applied to\nlearn a mapping for speech-to-speech conversion from a speaker to a target\nspeaker.

In\nthis paper, we propose a domain adaptation method based on generative\nadversarial nets (GANs) with disentangled representation learning to achieve\nrobustness in ASR systems. In particular, two separated encoders, context and\ndomain encoders, are introduced to learn distinct latent variables. The latent\nvariables allow us to convert the domain of speech according to its context and\ndomain representation.

Although physics-based methods, such\nas effective medium theory and solving partial differential equation, dominate\nthe relevant research, there is significant interest to establish the\nstructure-property linkage through the machine learning method. The performance\nof general machine learning methods is highly dependent on features selected to\nrepresent the microstructures. 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can\ndirectly extract geometric features of composites, which have been demonstrated\nto establish structure-property linkages with high accuracy. However, to obtain\nthe 3D microstructure in composite is generally challenging in reality. In this\nwork, we attempt to use 2D cross-section images which can be easier to obtain\nin real applications as input of 2D CNNs to predict effective thermal\nconductivity of 3D composites. The results show that by using multiple\ncross-section images along or perpendicular to the preferred directionality of\nthe fillers, the prediction accuracy of 2D CNNs can be as good as 3D CNNs. Such\na result is demonstrated with the particle filled composite and a stochastic\ncomplex composite. The prediction accuracy is dependent on the\nrepresentativeness of cross-section images used. Multiple cross-section images\ncan fully determine the shape and distribution of fillers. The average over\nmultiple images and the use of large-size images can reduce the uncertainty and\nincrease the prediction accuracy. Besides, since cross-section images along the\nheat flow direction can distinguish between serial structures and parallel\nstructures, they are more representative than cross-section images\nperpendicular to the heat flow direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 08:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-15"}

The analysis is based on a general expression for the\nphase stiffness in a mean-field state with coexisting spin-singlet\nsuperconductivity and spiral magnetism. Neel order is included as a special\ncase. Close to half-filling, where the pairing gap is much smaller than the\nmagnetic gap, a simple formula for the phase stiffness in terms of magnetic\nquasi-particle bands is derived. The phase stiffness is determined by charge\ncarriers in small electron or hole pockets in this regime. The general analysis\nis complemented by a numerical calculation for the two-dimensional Hubbard\nmodel with nearest and next-to-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes at a\nmoderate interaction strength. The resulting phase stiffness exhibits a\nstriking electron-hole asymmetry. In the ground state, it is larger than the\npairing gap on the hole-doped side, and smaller for electron doping. Hence, in\nthe hole-doped regime near half-filling the ground state pairing gap sets the\nscale for the Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature T_c^{KT}, while in the slightly\nelectron-doped regime T_c^{KT} is determined essentially by the ground state\nphase stiffness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 09:20:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2019 04:53:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

However, the\njoint prediction of these tasks, called scene flow, has traditionally been\ntackled using slow classical methods based on primitive assumptions which fail\nto generalize. The work presented in this paper overcomes these drawbacks\nefficiently (in terms of speed and accuracy) by proposing PWOC-3D, a compact\nCNN architecture to predict scene flow from stereo image sequences in an\nend-to-end supervised setting. Further, large motion and occlusions are\nwell-known problems in scene flow estimation. PWOC-3D employs specialized\ndesign decisions to explicitly model these challenges. In this regard, we\npropose a novel self-supervised strategy to predict occlusions from images\n(learned without any labeled occlusion data).

In this paper, we propose and numerically\ndemonstrate a terahertz spin-decoupled bifunctional meta-coupler for SSP\nexcitation and beam steering. The designed meta-coupler is composed of a\ncoupling metasurface and a propagating metasurface. The former aims at\nrealizing anomalous reflection or converting the incident waves into SSP under\nthe illumination of the left or right circular polarization waves,\nrespectively, and the latter are used to guide out the excited SSP. The\nrespective converting efficiency can reach 82% and 70% at 0.3THz for the right\nand left circular polarization incident waves. Besides, by appropriately\nadjusting the reflection phase distribution, many other diversified\nfunctionalities can also be integrated into the meta-coupler.

Using analytic and numerical methods, we explore how different NS\nnatal kick velocity distributions, pre-SN orbital separations, and progenitor\nHe-star masses affect the post-SN orbital periods, eccentricities, merger\ntimes, systemic velocities, and distances traveled by the system before\nmerging. Comparison with the set of 17 known DNSs in the Milky Way shows that\nDNSs have pre-SN orbital separations ranging between 1 and 44 $R_{\\odot}$.\nThose DNSs with pre-SN separations $\\sim$1 $R_{\\odot}$ have merger time\ndistributions that peak $\\sim$10-100 Myr after formation, regardless of the\nkick velocity received by the NS.

As soon as a job has been submitted, the commitment constraint forces us\nto decide immediately whether we accept or reject the job. Upon acceptance of a\njob, we must complete it before its deadline $d$ that satisfies $d \\geq\n(1+\\epsilon)\\cdot p + r$, with $p$ and $r$ being the processing time and the\nsubmission time of the job, respectively while $\\epsilon>0$ is the slack of the\nsystem. Since the hard case typically arises for near-tight deadlines, we\nconsider $\\varepsilon\\leq 1$. We use competitive analysis to evaluate our\nalgorithms. Our first main contribution is a deterministic preemptive online\nalgorithm with an almost tight competitive ratio on any number of machines. For\na single machine, the competitive factor matches the optimal bound\n$\\frac{1+\\epsilon}{\\epsilon}$ of the greedy acceptance policy. Then the\ncompetitive ratio improves with an increasing number of machines and approaches\n$(1+\\epsilon)\\cdot\\ln \\frac{1+\\epsilon}{\\epsilon}$ as the number of machines\nconverges to infinity. This is an exponential improvement over the greedy\nacceptance policy for small $\\epsilon$. In the non-preemptive case, we present\na deterministic algorithm on $m$ machines with a competitive ratio of $1+m\\cdot\n\\left(\\frac{1+\\epsilon}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{m}}$. This matches the\noptimal bound of $2+\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ of the greedy acceptance policy for a\nsingle machine while it again guarantees an exponential improvement over the\ngreedy acceptance policy for small $\\epsilon$ and large $m$. In addition, we\ndetermine an almost tight lower bound that approaches $m\\cdot\n\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{m}}$ for large $m$ and small\n$\\epsilon$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 10:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-15"}

To approximate the\nmapping functions, we propose an algorithm inspired by the knowledge\ndistillation, denoted the neural couplings algorithm (NCA).

This outburst dwarfs any\nother optical event that has been observed for this system during the last 5\nyears. The large increase in optical brightness of the system implies an\nincrease in the size and density of the Be star's circumstellar disc. The X-ray\ndata show two occultations of the neutron star per orbit and is not consistent\nwith a neutron star passing behind the Be star, and hence the disc is\nresponsible for these occultations. In this paper, we model the outburst of\nBe/neutron star binary SXP 5.05 as being due to a large increase in mass\nejection by the Be star. The neutron star passes directly through the growing\ndisc, and it is shown that the resulting obscuration can qualitatively explain\nthe observed X-ray behaviour of the system. We find the only way to reproduce\nthe timescales of the observed optical behaviour of the system is to increase\nthe mass ejection substantially for a short time (<2 orbits) and to decrease\nthe viscosity during the event.

First, application\nof Bayesian inference allows the selection of an adaptive basis for the\nmeasurements which yields the optimal amount of information about the phase\nshifts of the state. Secondly, this method can process the outcomes of\ndifferent observables at the same time. This leads to a substantial decrease in\nthe resources needed for the estimation of phases, speeding up the state\ncharacterisation and optimisation in experimental implementations.

A theoretical model is developed which shows that,\nin this linear-optics context, the quantum strategy suffers from the\ncontribution of multiple background photons. This effect does not appear in our\nclassical scheme. By improving the two-photon detection electronics, it should\nbe possible to achieve a polarization-based quantum advantage for a signal to\nnoise ratio that is close to 1/400 for current technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 12:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

Solar outflows are a considerable source of free energy which\naccumulates in multiple forms like beaming (or drifting) components and/or\ntemperature anisotropies. However, kinetic anisotropies of plasma particles do\nnot grow indefinitely and particle-particle collisions are not efficient enough\nto explain the observed limits of these anisotropies. Instead, the\nself-generated wave instabilities can efficiently act to constrain kinetic\nanisotropies, but the existing approaches are simplified and do not provide\nsatisfactory explanations. Thus, small deviations from isotropy shown by the\nelectron temperature ($T$) in fast solar winds are not explained yet.\n  Aims. This paper provides an advanced quasilinear description of the whistler\ninstability driven by the anisotropic electrons in conditions typical for the\nfast solar winds. The enhanced whistler-like fluctuations may constrain the\nupper limits of temperature anisotropy $A \\equiv T_\\perp /T_\\parallel > 1$,\nwhere $\\perp, \\parallel$ are defined with respect to the magnetic field\ndirection.\n  Methods.

A profound consequence of using these degrees of\nfreedom is the emergence of an overarching periodicity in the local atomic\nregistry of the constituent crystal structures, known as a moir\\'e\nsuperlattice. Its presence in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) structures\nled to the observation of electronic minibands, whereas its effect enhanced by\ninterlayer resonant conditions in twisted graphene bilayers culminated in the\nobservation of the superconductor-insulator transition at magic twist angles.\nHere, we demonstrate that, in semiconducting heterostructures built of\nincommensurate MoSe2 and WS2 monolayers, excitonic bands can hybridise,\nresulting in the resonant enhancement of the moir\\'e superlattice effects.\nMoSe2 and WS2 are specifically chosen for the near degeneracy of their\nconduction band edges to promote the hybridisation of intra- and interlayer\nexcitons, which manifests itself through a pronounced exciton energy shift as a\nperiodic function of the interlayer rotation angle. This occurs as hybridised\nexcitons (hX) are formed by holes residing in MoSe2 bound to a twist-dependent\nsuperposition of electron states in the adjacent monolayers.

It relies on the observation that the\ndynamical structure factor of the interacting electron gas shows a logarithmic\nthreshold singularity when evaluated to first order perturbation theory in the\ntwo-particle interaction. This term was interpreted as the linear one in an\nexpansion which was conjectured to resum to a power law. A field theory, the\nmobile impurity model, which is constructed such that it provides the power law\nin the structure factor, was suggested to be the proper effective model and\nused to compute the single-particle spectral function. This forms the basis of\nthe nonlinear Luttinger liquid phenomenology. Surprisingly, the second order\nperturbative contribution to the structure factor was so far not studied. We\nfirst close this gap and show that it is consistent with the conjectured power\nlaw. Secondly, we critically assess the steps leading to the mobile impurity\nHamiltonian. We show that the model does not allow to include the effect of the\nmomentum dependence of the (bulk) two-particle potential.

Only future instruments such as\nthe X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) on Athena will have the spatial and\nspectral resolution to quantitatively investigate the ICM turbulence at all\nscales. Powerful diagnostics for these studies are line shift and the line\nbroadening maps, and the second-order structure function. When estimating these\nquantities, instruments will be limited by uncertainties of their measurements,\nand by the sample variance (aka cosmic variance) of the observation. We extend\nhere the formalism started in our companion paper I to include the effect of\nstatistical uncertainties in the estimation of these line diagnostics, in\nparticular for structure functions.

In particular, we prove in this paper\nthat gradient policy method can be cast as a supervised learning problem where\ntrue label are replaced with discounted rewards. We provide a new proof of\npolicy gradient methods (PGM) that emphasizes the tight link with the cross\nentropy and supervised learning. We provide a simple experiment where we\ninterchange label and pseudo rewards. We conclude that other relationships with\nSL could be made if we modify the reward functions wisely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 14:49:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 07:39:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 17:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-03"}

To\nreproduce the correct DM relic density in these models, the leading term in the\ncross section is proportional to the DM velocity squared ($p$-wave\nannihilation). Indirect detection of such $p$-wave DM is difficult because the\naverage velocities of DM in galaxies today are orders of magnitude slower than\nthe DM velocity at the time of decoupling from the primordial thermal plasma,\nsuppressing the annihilation cross-section today by some five orders of\nmagnitude relative to its value at freeze out. Thus $p$-wave DM is out of reach\nof traditional searches for DM annihilations in the Galactic halo. Near the\nregion of influence of a central supermassive black hole, such as Sgr A$^*$,\nhowever, DM can form a localized over-density known as a `spike'.

The\nattack requires a profound understanding of the cache replacement policy. We\npresent a methodology to recover the replacement policy and apply it to the\nlast five generations of Intel processors. We further show empirically that the\nperformance of RELOAD+REFRESH on cryptographic implementations is comparable to\nthat of other widely used cache attacks, while its detectability becomes\nextremely difficult, due to the negligible effect on the victims cache access\npattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 15:30:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-15"}

Active\npenetration of nanoparticles through cell membranes is a fascinating phenomenon\nthat may have important implications in various biomedical and clinical\napplications. Using a fully analytical theory supplemented by particle-based\ncomputer simulations, the penetration process of an active particle through a\nplanar two-dimensional elastic membrane is studied. The membrane is modeled as\na self-assembled sheet of particles, uniformly arranged on a square lattice. A\ncoarse-grained model is introduced to describe the mutual interactions between\nthe membrane particles. The active penetrating particle is assumed to interact\nsterically with the membrane particles. State diagrams are presented to fully\ncharacterize the system behavior as functions of the relevant control\nparameters governing the transition between different dynamical states. Three\ndistinct scenarios are identified. These compromise trapping of the active\nparticle, penetration through the membrane with subsequent self-healing, in\naddition to penetration with permanent disruption of the membrane. The latter\nscenario is accompanied by a partial fragmentation of the membrane and creation\nof a hole of a size exceeding the interaction range of the membrane components.\nOur analytical theory is based on a combination of a perturbative expansion\ntechnique and a discrete-to-continuum formulation.

In\nour work we will present a new and innovative architectural approach of\napplying state-of-the-art hierarchical multi-module encoder-decoder\narchitecture in order to solve several of current state-of-the-art recommender\nsystems issues. Our approach will also produce by-products such as product\nneed-based segmentation and customer behavioral segmentation - all in an\nend-to-end trainable approach. Finally, we will present a couple methods that\nsolve known retail & distribution pain-points based on the proposed\narchitecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 18:15:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 May 2019 05:22:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 May 2019 14:20:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 17:03:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-24"}

The frequency response\nof the photodetector is evaluated by coupling of a femtosecond laser source\nthrough SiN grating coupler of the integrated photodetector. We estimate a 3dB\nbandwidth of 14 GHz at 20 V bias, highest reported bandwidth for a waveguide\nintegrated Si photodetector. We also present detailed optoelectronic DC and AC\ncharacterisation of the fabricated devices. The demonstrated integrated\nphotodetector could enable an integrated solution for scaling of short reach\ndata communication and connectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 17:35:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-16"}
