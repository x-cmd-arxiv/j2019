For a fixed channel $\\mathcal{E}$ and a state\n$\\sigma$, the divergence between output states $\\mathcal{E}(\\rho)$ and\n$\\mathcal{E}(\\sigma)$ might be strictly smaller than the divergence between\ninput states $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$, which is characterized by the strong data\nprocessing inequality (SDPI). Among various input states $\\rho$, the largest\nvalue of the rate of contraction is known as the SDPI constant. An important\nand widely studied property for classical channels is that SDPI constants\ntensorize.

Spontaneous scalarization of BHs is a phenomenon that the\nscalar field spontaneously obtains a nontrivial profile in the vicinity of the\nevent horizon via the nonminimal couplings and eventually the BH possesses a\nscalar charge. In the theory in which spontaneous scalarization takes place,\nthe Schwarzschild solution with a trivial profile of the scalar field exhibits\na tachyonic instability in the vicinity of the event horizon, and evolves into\na hairy BH solution.

Compared with existing models that are purely analytical or purely\ndata-driven, our hybrid model captures the dynamics of interacting objects in a\nmore accurate and data-efficient manner.Experiments both in simulation and on a\nreal robot suggest that it also leads to better performance when used in\ncomplex control tasks.

Weyl conformal geometry also has a\nbuilt-in geometric Stueckelberg mechanism: it is broken spontaneously to\nRiemannian geometry after a Weyl gauge transformation (of \"gauge fixing\") while\nStueckelberg mechanism re-arranges the degrees of freedom, conserving their\nnumber ($n_{df}$). The Weyl gauge field ($\\omega_\\mu$) of local scale\ntransformations acquires a mass after absorbing a compensator (dilaton),\ndecouples, and Weyl connection becomes Riemannian. Mass generation has thus a\ndynamic origin, as a transition from Weyl to Riemannian geometry. We show that\na \"gauge fixing\" symmetry transformation of the original Weyl quadratic gravity\naction in its Weyl geometry formulation immediately gives the Einstein-Proca\naction for the Weyl gauge field and a positive cosmological constant, plus\nmatter action (if present). As a result, the Planck scale is an {\\it emergent}\nscale, where Weyl gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken and Einstein action is\nthe broken phase of Weyl action. This is in contrast to local scale invariant\nmodels (no gauging) where a negative kinetic term (ghost dilaton) remains\npresent and $n_{df}$ is not conserved when this symmetry is broken. The mass of\n$\\omega_\\mu$, setting the non-metricity scale, can be much smaller than\n$M_\\text{Planck}$, for ultraweak values of the coupling ($q$). If matter is\npresent, a positive contribution to the Planck scale from a scalar field\n($\\phi_1$) vev induces a negative (mass)$^2$ term for $\\phi_1$ and spontaneous\nbreaking of the symmetry under which it is charged. These results are immediate\nwhen using a Weyl geometry formulation of an action instead of its Riemannian\npicture. Briefly, Weyl gauge symmetry is physically relevant and its role in\nhigh scale physics should be reconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Apr 2019 22:21:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 May 2019 13:46:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 08:35:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 19 Oct 2019 11:22:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

By comparing the\nspectrum of SN~2007D with that of some superluminous SNe (SLSNe), we find that\nit might be a luminous SN like several luminous ``gap-filler\" optical\ntransients that bridge ordinary and SLSNe, rather than a genuine SLSN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Apr 2019 22:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

However, when the data dimension p is comparable to the\nsample size $N$, maximum likelihood estimates for its regression parameters are\nknown to be biased or break down entirely due to overfitting. This prompted the\nintroduction of the so-called regularized Cox model. In this paper we use the\nreplica method from statistical physics to investigate the relationship between\nthe true and inferred regression parameters in regularized multivariate Cox\nregression with L2 regularization, in the regime where both p and N are large\nbut with p/N ~ O(1). We thereby generalize a recent study from maximum\nlikelihood to maximum a posteriori inference. We also establish a relationship\nbetween the optimal regularization parameter and p/N, allowing for\nstraightforward overfitting corrections in time-to-event analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Apr 2019 05:48:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 12:15:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In a video, normal is used\nto describe activities that conform to usual events while the irregular events\nwhich do not conform to the normal are referred to as abnormal. It is far more\ncommon to observe normal data than to obtain abnormal data in visual\nsurveillance. In this paper, we propose an approach where we can obtain\nabnormal data by transforming normal data. This is a challenging task that is\nsolved through a multi-stage pipeline approach. We utilize a number of\ntechniques from unsupervised segmentation in order to synthesize new samples of\ndata that are transformed from an existing set of normal examples. Further,\nthis synthesis approach has useful applications as a data augmentation\ntechnique. An incrementally trained Bayesian convolutional neural network (CNN)\nis used to carefully select the set of abnormal samples that can be added.\nFinally through this synthesis approach we obtain a comparable set of abnormal\nsamples that can be used for training the CNN for the classification of normal\nvs abnormal samples.

In addition,\nthis conception is counterproductive, because it gives incorrect ideas about\nthe structure of the vortex tangle as a set of bundles containing parallel\nlines. The only type of dynamics of vortex filaments inside these bundles is\npossible, namely, Kelvin waves running along the filaments. At the same time,\nas shown in numerous numerical simulations, a vortex tangle consists of a set\nof entangled vortex loops of different sizes and having a random walk\nstructure. These loops are subject to large deformations (due to highly\nnonlinear dynamics), they reconnect with each other and with the wall, split\nand merge, creating a lot of daughter loops.

Therefore, it has been suggested\nthat robustness against extrinsic noise increases with the level of the\nintrinsic noise. We call this phenomenon intrinsic noise-induced robustness\n(INIR). As previous studies on this phenomenon have focused on complex\nbiochemical reactions, the relation between INIR and the input--output of a\nsystem is unclear. Moreover, the mechanism of INIR remains elusive. In this\npaper, we address these questions by analyzing simple models. We first analyze\na model in which the input--output relation is linear. We show that the\nrobustness against extrinsic noise increases with the intrinsic noise,\nconfirming the INIR phenomenon. Moreover, the robustness against the extrinsic\nnoise is more strongly dependent on the intrinsic noise when the variance of\nthe intrinsic noise is larger than that of the input distribution. Next, we\nanalyze a threshold model in which the output depends on whether the input\nexceeds the threshold. When the threshold is equal to the mean of the input,\nINIR is realized, but when the threshold is much larger than the mean, the\nthreshold model exhibits stochastic resonance, and INIR is not always apparent.\nThe robustness against extrinsic noise and the transmitted information can be\ntraded off against one another in the linear model and the threshold model\nwithout stochastic resonance, whereas they can be simultaneously increased in\nthe threshold model with stochastic resonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Apr 2019 06:48:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 03:25:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 01:14:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

In a two-terminal device, because Andreev\nretro-reflection is not allowed for just the anti-chiral edges, in this case\nthe mutual scattering between edge and bulk states is necessary, which leads\nthat the coefficient of Andreev retro-reflection is always symmetrical about\nthe incident energy. In a four-terminal junction, however, the edges are\nparallel to the interface of superconductor and graphene, so at the interface\nan incident electron travelling along the edges can be retro-reflected as a\nhole into bulk modes, or specularly reflected as a hole into anti-chiral edge\nstates again. It is noted that, the coefficient of specular Andreev reflection\nkeeps symmetric as to the incident energy of electron which is consistent with\nthe reported results before, however the coefficient of Andreev\nretro-reflection shows an unexpected asymmetrical behavior due to the presence\nof anti-chiral edge states.

Often this question is answered using structural properties such as\nhigh connectedness or centrality in the network. However, static structural\nconnectedness does not necessarily translate to dynamical importance. To\ndemonstrate this, we simulate the kinetic Ising spin model on generated\nnetworks and one real-world weighted network. The dynamic impact of nodes is\nassessed by causally intervening on node state probabilities and measuring the\neffect on the systemic dynamics. The results show that structural features such\nas network centrality or connectedness are actually poor predictors of the\ndynamical impact of a node on the rest of the network. A solution is offered in\nthe form of an information theoretical measure named integrated mutual\ninformation. The metric is able to accurately predict the dynamically most\nimportant node ('driver' node) in networks based on observational data of\nnon-intervened dynamics. We conclude that the driver node(s) in networks are\nnot necessarily the most well-connected or central nodes. Indeed, the common\nassumption of network structural features being proportional to dynamical\nimportance is false.

If both time scales are identical cooperation\ncannot persist in a homogeneous population. If, however, the time scale of the\ncooperator is distinctively different from that of the defector, cooperation\nmay become a locally asymptotically stable strategy. Interestingly enough, in\nthe seedbank case the cooperator needs to be faster than the defector, while in\nthe quiescent case the cooperator has to be slower. We use adaptive dynamics to\nidentify situations where cooperation may evolve and form a convergent stable\nESS. We conclude by highlighting the relevance fo these results for many\nnon-model species and the maintenance of cooperation in microbial, invertebrate\nor plant populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Apr 2019 09:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

Active\nlearning, which can be regarded as an iterative optimization procedure, plays a\nkey role to construct a refined training set to improve the classification\nperformance in a variety of applications, such as text analysis, image\nrecognition, social network modeling, etc.\n  Although combining representativeness and informativeness of samples has been\nproven promising for active sampling, state-of-the-art methods perform well\nunder certain data structures. Then can we find a way to fuse the two active\nsampling criteria without any assumption on data? This paper proposes a general\nactive learning framework that effectively fuses the two criteria.

Meanwhile, it is also hard to build a good model without diagnosing\ndiscriminative labels. Can we reduce the label costs and improve the ability to\ntrain a good model for multi-label learning simultaneously?\n  Active learning addresses the less training samples problem by querying the\nmost valuable samples to achieve a better performance with little costs. In\nmulti-label active learning, some researches have been done for querying the\nrelevant labels with less training samples or querying all labels without\ndiagnosing the discriminative information. They all cannot effectively handle\nthe outlier labels for the measurement of uncertainty. Since Maximum\nCorrentropy Criterion (MCC) provides a robust analysis for outliers in many\nmachine learning and data mining algorithms, in this paper, we derive a robust\nmulti-label active learning algorithm based on MCC by merging uncertainty and\nrepresentativeness, and propose an efficient alternating optimization method to\nsolve it. With MCC, our method can eliminate the influence of outlier labels\nthat are not discriminative to measure the uncertainty. To make further\nimprovement on the ability of information measurement, we merge uncertainty and\nrepresentativeness with the prediction labels of unknown data. It can not only\nenhance the uncertainty but also improve the similarity measurement of\nmulti-label data with labels information. Experiments on benchmark multi-label\ndata sets have shown a superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Apr 2019 12:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

Previous\nmethods employ sequential neural networks (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network) to\nencode users' historical interactions from left to right into hidden\nrepresentations for making recommendations. Although these methods achieve\nsatisfactory results, they often assume a rigidly ordered sequence which is not\nalways practical. We argue that such left-to-right unidirectional architectures\nrestrict the power of the historical sequence representations. For this\npurpose, we introduce a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\nfor sequential Recommendation (BERT4Rec). However, jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in deep bidirectional model would make the training\nbecome trivial since each item can indirectly \"see the target item\". To address\nthis problem, we train the bidirectional model using the Cloze task, predicting\nthe masked items in the sequence by jointly conditioning on their left and\nright context. Comparing with predicting the next item at each position in a\nsequence, the Cloze task can produce more samples to train a more powerful\nbidirectional model. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that\nour model outperforms various state-of-the-art sequential models consistently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Apr 2019 13:01:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 07:36:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-22"}

Elicitation of\ndrivers' preferences using a unique sample (N=11,902) of the U.S. population\nresiding in TNC-served areas is the key feature of this study. The statistical\nanalysis indicates that ridehailing services are mainly attracting personal\nvehicle users as riders, without substantially affecting demand for transit.\nMoreover, around 10% of ridehailing users reported postponing the purchase of a\nnew car due to the availability of TNC services.

Episodes also\nenforce in which order the events are allowed to occur.\n  In this work we introduce a technique for discovering closed episodes.\nAdopting existing approaches for discovering traditional patterns, such as\nclosed itemsets, to episodes is not straightforward. First of all, we cannot\ndefine a unique closure based on frequency because an episode may have several\nclosed superepisodes. Moreover, to define a closedness concept for episodes we\nneed a subset relationship between episodes, which is not trivial to define.\n  We approach these problems by introducing strict episodes. We argue that this\nclass is general enough, and at the same time we are able to define a natural\nsubset relationship within it and use it efficiently. In order to mine closed\nepisodes we define an auxiliary closure operator. We show that this closure\nsatisfies the needed properties so that we can use the existing framework for\nmining closed patterns. Discovering the true closed episodes can be done as a\npost-processing step. We combine these observations into an efficient mining\nalgorithm and demonstrate empirically its performance in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Apr 2019 00:24:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 23:19:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-26"}

Each\nvortex in the vortex lattice is quantized with vorticity one from the direct\ninspection of their phases. As the angular velocity of the disk is greater than\na critical value, the first vortex will be excited as expected from theoretical\npredictions. The subsequent two and more vortices are also generated by\nincreasingly rotating the disk, resulting in the remarkable step transitions\nfor the angular velocity to excite each individual vortex.

From the viewpoint of item, an item could be\npurchased by different users together with different items, for different\nreasons. Therefore, an ideal recommender system should represent an item\nconsidering its transaction contexts. Existing state-of-the-art deep learning\nmethods usually adopt the static item representations, which are invariant\namong all of the transactions and thus cannot achieve the full potentials of\ndeep learning. Inspired by the pre-trained representations of BERT in natural\nlanguage processing, we propose to conduct context-aware item representation\nfor next basket recommendation, called Item Encoder Representations from\nTransformers (IERT). In the offline phase, IERT pre-trains deep item\nrepresentations conditioning on their transaction contexts. In the online\nrecommendation phase, the pre-trained model is further fine-tuned with an\nadditional output layer. The output contextualized item embeddings are used to\ncapture users' sequential behaviors and general tastes to conduct\nrecommendation. Experimental results on the Ta-Feng data set show that IERT\noutperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods, which demonstrated the\neffectiveness of IERT in next basket representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Apr 2019 14:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

More precisely, deep neural networks (DNNs) drastically\nincreased the performances of SLU systems, and numerous architectures have been\nproposed. In the real-life context of theme identification of telephone\nconversations, it is common to hold both a human, manual (TRS) and an\nautomatically transcribed (ASR) versions of the conversations. Nonetheless, and\ndue to production constraints, only the ASR transcripts are considered to build\nautomatic classifiers. TRS transcripts are only used to measure the\nperformances of ASR systems. Moreover, the recent performances in term of\nclassification accuracy, obtained by DNN related systems are close to the\nperformances reached by humans, and it becomes difficult to further increase\nthe performances by only considering the ASR transcripts. This paper proposes\nto distillates the TRS knowledge available during the training phase within the\nASR representation, by using a new generative adversarial network called\nM2H-GAN to generate a TRS-like version of an ASR document, to improve the theme\nidentification performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Apr 2019 20:04:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-07"}
