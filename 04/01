In order to use machine learning in a\nsafety-critical system, it is necessary to demonstrate the safety and security\nof the system through engineering processes. However, thus far, no such widely\naccepted engineering concepts or frameworks have been established for these\nsystems. The key to using a machine learning model in a deductively engineered\nsystem is decomposing the data-driven training of machine learning models into\nrequirement, design, and verification, particularly for machine learning models\nused in safety-critical systems. Simultaneously, open problems and relevant\ntechnical fields are not organized in a manner that enables researchers to\nselect a theme and work on it. In this study, we identify, classify, and\nexplore the open problems in engineering (safety-critical) machine learning\nsystems --- that is, in terms of requirement, design, and verification of\nmachine learning models and systems --- as well as discuss related works and\nresearch directions, using automated driving vehicles as an example. Our\nresults show that machine learning models are characterized by a lack of\nrequirements specification, lack of design specification, lack of\ninterpretability, and lack of robustness. We also perform a gap analysis on a\nconventional system quality standard SQuARE with the characteristics of machine\nlearning models to study quality models for machine learning systems. We find\nthat a lack of requirements specification and lack of robustness have the\ngreatest impact on conventional quality models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 13:57:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 17:08:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-23"}

In addition, a third narrow peak, $P_c(4312)^+$, having the mass\n$M=(4311.9\\pm 0.7^{+6.8}_{-0.6})$ MeV and decay width $\\Gamma=(9.8\\pm\n2.7^{+3.7}_{-4.5})$ MeV is also observed.

Also the spin-parity, $J^P$,\nassignments of the states are not yet determined.

The heterogeneous server structure of the\nsystem makes the scheduling much harder than scheduling for systems with\nhomogeneous servers. Throughput optimality of the system on one hand and delay\noptimality on the other hand creates a dilemma for assigning tasks to servers.\nThe JSQ-MaxWeight and Balanced-Pandas algorithms are the states of the arts\nalgorithms with theoretical guarantees on throughput and delay optimality for\nsystems with two and three levels of data locality. However, the scheduling\ncomplexity of these two algorithms are way too much. Hence, we use the power of\n$d$ choices algorithm combined with the Balanced-Pandas algorithm and the\nJSQ-MaxWeight algorithm, and compare the complexity of the simple algorithms\nand the power of $d$ choices versions of them. We will further show that the\nBalanced-Pandas algorithm combined with the power of the $d$ choices,\nBalanced-Pandas-Pod, not only performs better than simple Balanced-Pandas, but\nalso is less sensitive to the parameter $d$ than the combination of the\nJSQ-MaxWeight algorithm and the power of the $d$ choices, JSQ-MaxWeight-Pod.

In this paper, the system spectral efficiency (SSE) of an\nuplink LIS system is asymptotically analyzed under a practical LIS environment\nwith a well-defined uplink frame structure. In order to verify the impact on\nthe SSE of pilot contamination, the SSE of a multi-LIS system is asymptotically\nstudied and a theoretical bound on its performance is derived.

We\nconducted a survey with participants of the Global Game Jam (GGJ), a 48-hour\nhackathon.

In the same way, turbulence affects the orientation of\naggregates of organic matter settling in the ocean. In fact most solid\nparticles encountered in Nature are not spherical, and their orientation\naffects their settling speed, as well as collision rates between particles.\nTherefore it is important to understand the distribution of orientations of\nnon-spherical particles settling in turbulence. Here we study the angular\ndynamics of small prolate spheroids settling in homogeneous isotropic\nturbulence. We consider a limit of the problem where the fluid torque due to\nconvective inertia dominates, so that rods settle essentially horizontally.\nTurbulence causes the orientation of the settling particles to fluctuate, and\nwe calculate their orientation distribution for prolate spheroids with\narbitrary aspect ratios for large settling number Sv (a dimensionless measure\nof the settling speed), assuming small Stokes number St (a dimensionless\nmeasure of particle inertia). This overdamped theory predicts that the\norientation distribution is very narrow at large Sv, with a variance\nproportional to ${\\rm Sv}^{-4}$. By considering the role of particle inertia,\nwe analyse the limitations of the overdamped theory, and determine its range of\napplicability. Our predictions are in excellent agreement with numerical\nsimulations of simplified models of turbulent flows. Finally we contrast our\nresults with those of an alternative theory predicting that the orientation\nvariance scales as ${\\rm Sv}^{-2}$ at large Sv.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Mar 2019 21:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

We compare two different sigma estimates; one based on SDSS\nspectroscopy (sigma_spec) and another on photometric estimates (sigma_mod). The\nsigma_spec for our sample is systematically higher than sigma_mod for all\nranges of sigma, implying that rotational velocity may affect sigma_spec\nmeasurements. The VDFs measured from these quantities are remarkably similar\nfor lower sigma values, but the sigma_mod VDF falls faster than the sigma_spec\nVDF at log sigma > 2.35.

Theory predicts that the same\nlocking of modes would occur in random lasers but, in absence of any device,\nits detection is unfeasible so far. Because of the general interest in the\nphenomenology and understanding of random lasers and, moreover, because it is a\nfirst example of self-starting mode-locking we devise and test a way to measure\nsuch peculiar non-linear coupling. Through a detailed analysis of multi-mode\ncorrelations we provide clear evidence for the occurrence of nonlinear\nmode-coupling in the cavity-less random laser made of a powder of GaAs crystals\nand its self-starting mode-locking nature. The behavior of multi-point\ncorrelations among intensity peaks is tested against the nonlinear frequency\nmatching condition equivalent to the one underlying phase-locking in ordered\nultrafast lasers. Non-trivially large multi-point correlations are clearly\nobserved for spatially overlapping resonances and turn out to sensitively\ndepend on the frequency matching being satisfied, eventually demonstrating the\noccurrence of non-linear mode-locked mode-coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Mar 2019 21:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

A known problem, though, is that\npolicies overfit to the training environment and may not avoid rare,\ncatastrophic events such as automotive accidents. A classical technique for\nimproving the robustness of reinforcement learning algorithms is to train on a\nset of randomized environments, but this approach only guards against common\nsituations. Recently, robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL) was\ndeveloped, which allows efficient applications of random and systematic\nperturbations by a trained adversary. A limitation of RARL is that only the\nexpected control objective is optimized; there is no explicit modeling or\noptimization of risk. Thus the agents do not consider the probability of\ncatastrophic events (i.e., those inducing abnormally large negative reward),\nexcept through their effect on the expected objective. In this paper we\nintroduce risk-averse robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARARL), using\na risk-averse protagonist and a risk-seeking adversary. We test our approach on\na self-driving vehicle controller. We use an ensemble of policy networks to\nmodel risk as the variance of value functions. We show through experiments that\na risk-averse agent is better equipped to handle a risk-seeking adversary, and\nexperiences substantially fewer crashes compared to agents trained without an\nadversary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Mar 2019 23:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

The main\nconclusion of our study is that systems separated into nanometer-sized \"blocks\"\ninside much larger simulations exhibit excess fluctuations in potential energy\n(pe) that diverge inversely proportional to T in a manner that is strongly\ndependent on the range of interaction. Specifically, at low T with long-range\ninteractions pe fluctuations exceed the EFR by at least an order of magnitude,\ndropping abruptly to below the EFR when interactions include only 1st-neighbor\natoms. A simplistic model that includes 2nd-neighbor interactions matches the\nbehavior of the excess pe fluctuations, but only if the 2nd-neighbor terms are\nnot included in Boltzmann's factor, attributable to energy localization due to\nanharmonic effects. Characterizing energy correlations as a function of time\nand distance reveals that excess pe fluctuations in a block coincide with\nnegative pe correlations between neighboring blocks, whereas reduced pe\nfluctuations coincide with positive pe correlations. Indeed, anomalous pe\nfluctuations in small systems at low T can be quantified by using the net\nenergy in Boltzmann's factor that includes the pe from a surrounding shell of\nsimilarly small systems, or equivalently an effective local temperature.

The\nfocus of this paper is on flame lift-off and re-attachment to the nozzle of a\nswirl combustor. Using time-resolved experimental measurements, a data-driven\napproach known as cluster-based reduced order modeling (CROM) is employed to 1)\nisolate key flow patterns and their sequence during the flame transitions, and\n2) formulate a forecasting model to predict the flame instability. The flow\npatterns isolated by the CROM methodology confirm some of the experimental\nconclusions about the flame transition mechanism. In particular, CROM\nhighlights the key role of the precessing vortex core (PVC) in the flame\ndetachment process in an unsupervised manner. For the attachment process,\nstrong flow recirculation far from the nozzle appears to drive the flame\nupstream, thus initiating re-attachment. Different data-types (velocity field,\nOH concentration) were processed by the modeling tool, and the predictive\ncapabilities of these different models are also compared. It was found that the\nswirling velocity possesses the best predictive properties, which gives a\nsupplemental argument for the role of the PVC in causing the flame transition.\nThe model is tested against unseen data and successfully predicts the\nprobability of flame transition (both detachment and attachment) when trained\nwith swirling velocity with minimal user input. The model trained with OH-PLIF\ndata was only successful at predicting the flame attachment, which implies that\ndifferent physical mechanisms are present for different types of flame\ntransition. Overall, these aspects show the great potential of data-driven\nmethods, particularly probabilistic forecasting techniques, in analyzing and\npredicting large-scale features in complex turbulent combustion problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 03:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

Research has shown that such group dynamics can be better modeled\nthrough a more general hypergraph model, resulting in the need to build\nscalable hypergraph processing systems. In this paper, we present MESH, a\nflexible distributed framework for scalable hypergraph processing. MESH\nprovides an easy-to-use and expressive application programming interface that\nnaturally extends the think like a vertex model common to many popular graph\nprocessing systems. Our framework provides a flexible implementation based on\nan underlying graph processing system, and enables different design choices for\nthe key implementation issues of partitioning a hypergraph representation. We\nimplement MESH on top of the popular GraphX graph processing framework in\nApache Spark. Using a variety of real datasets and experiments conducted on a\nlocal 8-node cluster as well as a 65-node Amazon AWS testbed, we demonstrate\nthat MESH provides flexibility based on data and application characteristics,\nas well as scalability with cluster size. We further show that it is\ncompetitive in performance to HyperX, another hypergraph processing system\nbased on Spark, while providing a much simpler implementation (requiring about\n5X fewer lines of code), thus showing that simplicity and flexibility need not\ncome at the cost of performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 03:44:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 20:38:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-14"}

We have developed a method that uses\na time-of-flight (ToF) camera to estimate an object region and depth in\nparticipating media simultaneously. The scattering component is saturated, so\nit does not depend on the scene depth, and received signals bouncing off\ndistant points are negligible due to light attenuation in the participating\nmedia, so the observation of such a point contains only a scattering component.\nThese phenomena enable us to estimate the scattering component in an object\nregion from a background that only contains the scattering component.

The\nrelevance of each neuron is identified with respect to its degree of\ncontribution, separated into positive and negative, while preserving the\nconservation rule. Considering the relevance assigned to neurons in terms of\nrelative priority, RAP allows each neuron to be assigned with a bi-polar\nimportance score concerning the output: from highly relevant to highly\nirrelevant. Therefore, our method makes it possible to interpret DNNs with much\nclearer and attentive visualizations of the separated attributions than the\nconventional explaining methods.

Although the MIT was previously\nexpected to be mainly driven by the orbital Coulomb repulsion energy, the\nentropy contribution to the orbital free energy that also determines the\nrelative stability of the metallic and insulating phases was largely\noverlooked. Herein, we demonstrate an orbital-entropy dominated reversible\nelectronic phase transition in the metastable perovskite family of correlated\nrare-earth nicklates (ReNiO3), in addition to their previously known MIT driven\nby orbital Coulomb energies. In reverse to MIT, the resistivity of ReNiO3\nabruptly increases by 2-3 orders by elevating T across another critical point\n(TR-MIT) below TMIT, and such transition is named as reverse-metal to insulator\ntransition (R-MIT). Combining the afterwards exponentially decreasing\nresistivity in the insulating phase of ReNiO3 at further temperature elevation,\na distinguished delta-temperatural transport character is established, which is\npotentially applicable for locking the working temperatures range for electric\ndevices. The TR-MIT is shown to be enhanced via reducing the compositional\ncomplexity and size of Re or imparting bi-axial compressive strains, and\nmeanwhile the transition sharpness of delta-temperatural transport is reduced.\nOur discovery indicates that temperature range for a thermodynamically stable\ninsulating phase of ReNiO3 is in between of TR-MIT and TMIT, while a new\nconductive phase with high orbital entropy is formed by further descending\ntemperature below TR-MIT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 07:43:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

The\nexperimental results agree well with the full wave simulation results. This\nwork may provide a reference for design and fabrication of dynamically tunable\nmicrowave absorber based on large-scale graphene and may promote the actual\napplications of graphene at microwave frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 08:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

These effects, usually unknown, act as a\nlimiting factor in achieving the required imaging performance and thus, their\ncalibration is crucial. To address this issue, we develop a global algorithm,\nnamed Polca SARA, aiming to perform full polarization, direction-dependent\ncalibration and sparse imaging by employing a non-convex optimization\ntechnique.

Most existing methods adopt\nspatially invariant bit length allocation and incorporate discrete entropy\napproximation to constrain compression rate. Nonetheless, the information\ncontent is spatially variant, where the regions with complex and salient\nstructures generally are more essential to image compression. Taking the\nspatial variation of image content into account, this paper presents a\ncontent-weighted encoder-decoder model, which involves an importance map subnet\nto produce the importance mask for locally adaptive bit rate allocation.\nConsequently, the summation of importance mask can thus be utilized as an\nalternative of entropy estimation for compression rate control. Furthermore,\nthe quantized representations of the learned code and importance map are still\nspatially dependent, which can be losslessly compressed using arithmetic\ncoding. To compress the codes effectively and efficiently, we propose a trimmed\nconvolutional network to predict the conditional probability of quantized\ncodes.

In fact, fixing these explicitly leads to the well-known\napproach of learning with random features. In other words, these techniques\nimply that we can successfully learn with neural networks, whenever we can\nsuccessfully learn with random features. In this paper, we first review these\ntechniques, providing a simple and self-contained analysis for one-hidden-layer\nnetworks.

Currently, the management of\nfailures in the data plane is limited to two mechanisms: proactive and\nreactive. Such failure recovery techniques are activated after occurrences of\nfailures. Therefore, packet loss is highly likely to occur as a result of\nservice disruption and unavailability. This issue is not only related to the\nslow speed of recovery mechanisms, but also the delay caused by the failure\ndetection process. In this paper, we define a new approach to the management of\nfault tolerance in software-defined networks where the goal is to eliminate the\nconvergence process altogether, rather than speed up failure detection and\nrecovery. We propose a new framework, called Smart Routing, which works based\non the forewarning signs on failures in order to compute alternative paths and\nisolate the risky links from the routing tables of the data plane devices.

The proposed edge registration method can be easily integrated into\ndirect VO frameworks to estimate photometrically, geometrically, and\nsemantically consistent camera motions. Different types of edges are evaluated\nand extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed system outperforms\nstate-of-art indirect, direct, and semantic monocular VO systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 12:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

It suffices to consider the case for when the\nsphere is 3-dimensional and where we take the group of symmetries to be\n$SO(4)$. As the 3-sphere is a group, both left and right multiplication on\nitself are commuting symmetries which together generate the full symmetry\ngroup. This gives rise to a notion of left and right momenta for the problem,\nand allows for a reduction in stages, first by the left and then the right, or\nvice versa. The intermediate reduced spaces obtained by left or right reduction\nare shown to be coadjoint orbits of the special Euclidean group $SE(4)$.

This is a challenging problem as a cloud service provider may\nhave insufficient resources to satisfy all user requests.

Resource sharing among different cloud service providers can\nimprove resource availability and resource utilization as certain cloud service\nproviders may have free resources available that can be ``rented'' by other\nservice providers. However, different cloud service providers can have\ndifferent objectives or \\emph{utilities}. Therefore, there is a need for a\nframework that can share and allocate resources in an efficient and effective\nway, while taking into account the objectives of various service providers that\nresults in a \\emph{multi-objective optimization} problem.

Motile\nsubpopulations in microbial communities are believed to be important to\ndispersal, quest for food, and material transport. However, except in\ncircumstances where motile cells drive colony expansion (e.g. bacterial\nswarming), the physiological functions of motile subpopulations in bacterial\ncommunities are largely unclear. Here we discovered that motile cells in\nroutinely cultured sessile colonies of peritrichously flagellated bacteria can\nself-organize into two adjacent, centimeter-scale motile rings surrounding the\nentire colony. The motile rings arise from spontaneous segregation of a\nhomogeneous swimmer suspension that mimics a phase separation; the process is\nmediated by intercellular interactions and shear-induced depletion. As a result\nof this self-organization, cells drive fluid flows to circulate around the\ncolony at a constant peak speed of approximately 30 microns per second,\nproviding a stable and high-speed avenue for directed material transport at the\nmacroscopic scale.

New human computer models use stresses and\nstrains to evaluate whether serious or fatal injuries are reached,\nunfortunately these tensors bear no direct relation to AIS. This paper proposes\nto overcome this deficiency and suggests a unique Organ Trauma Model (OTM) able\nto calculate the risk to life based on the severity on any organ injury,\nfocussing on real-life pedestrian accidents. The OTM uses a power method, named\nPeak Virtual Power (PVP), and calculates the risk to life of brain white and\ngrey matters as a function of impact direction and impact speed. The OTM\nfirstly calibrates PVP against the medical critical AIS threshold observed in\neach part of the head as a function of speed. This base PVP critical trauma\nfunction is then scaled and banded across all AIS levels using the confirmed\nproperty that AIS and the probability of death is statistically and numerically\na cubic one. The OTM model has been tested against four real-life pedestrian\naccidents and proven to be able to predict pedestrian head trauma severity. In\nsome cases, the method did however under-estimate the head trauma by 1 AIS\nlevel, because of post-impact haemorrhage which cannot be captured with the\nemployed Lagrangian Finite Element (FE) solver. It is also shown that the\nlocation of the injury predictions using PVP coincide with the post mortem\nreports and are different to the predictions made using maximum principal\nstrain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 15:49:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

For the specific\napplication of pathogen detection via binding of M13 bacteriophage, it is found\nthat increases in the channel depth are more significant in improving the\nlinear dichroism signal than increases in the channel width. Increasing channel\ndepth to $2~$mm and pressure gradient to $5 \\times 10^4~$Pa/m essentially\nmaximises the alignment. Oscillating flow can produce nearly equal alignment to\nsteady flow at appropriate frequencies, which has significant potential\npractical value in the analysis of small sample volumes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 13:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

Since the visual quality of an image patch is\nhighly correlated with its focus level, the focus-level maps are preliminarily\nobtained based on visual quality scores, as pre-estimations. However, the\npre-estimations are not ideal. Thus the fast bilateral solver is then adopted\nto smooth the pre-estimations, and edges in the multi-focus source images can\nbe preserved simultaneously. The edge-preserving smoothed results are utilized\nas final focus-level maps.

In this review, the success\nand the shortcomings of the $\\Lambda$CDM model, based on General Relativity and\nstandard model of particles, are discussed in view of the most recent\nobservational constraints. The motivations for considering extensions and\nmodifications of General Relativity are taken into account, with particular\nattention to $f(R)$ and $f(T)$ theories of gravity where dynamics is\nrepresented by curvature or torsion field respectively. The features of $f(R)$\nmodels are explored in metric and Palatini formalisms. We discuss the\nconnection between $f(R)$ gravity and scalar-tensor theories highlighting the\nrole of conformal transformations in the Einstein and Jordan frames.\nCosmological dynamics of $f(R)$ models is investigated through the\ncorresponding viability criteria. Afterwards, the equivalent formulation of\nGeneral Relativity (Teleparallel Equivalent General Relativity) in terms of\ntorsion and its extension to $f(T)$ gravity is considered. Finally, the\ncosmographic method is adopted to break the degeneracy among dark energy\nmodels. A novel approach, built upon rational Pad\\'e and Chebyshev polynomials,\nis proposed to overcome limits of standard cosmography based on Taylor\nexpansion. The approach provides accurate model-independent approximations of\nthe Hubble flow. Numerical analyses, based on Monte Carlo Markov Chain\nintegration of cosmic data, are presented to bound coefficients of the\ncosmographic series. These techniques are thus applied to reconstruct $f(R)$\nand $f(T)$ functions and to frame the late-time expansion history of the\nuniverse with no \\emph{a priori} assumptions on its equation of state.

Because dimension reduction is an essential tool which embeds\nhigh-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional subspace to avoid redundant\ninformation, it has attracted interests from researchers all over the world.\nHowever, facing with features from multiple views, it's difficult for most\ndimension reduction methods to fully comprehended multi-view features and\nintegrate compatible and complementary information from these features to\nconstruct low-dimensional subspace directly. Furthermore, most multi-view\ndimension reduction methods cannot handle features from nonlinear spaces with\nhigh dimensions. Therefore, how to construct a multi-view dimension reduction\nmethods which can deal with multi-view features from high-dimensional nonlinear\nspace is of vital importance but challenging. In order to address this problem,\nwe proposed a novel method named Co-regularized Multi-view Sparse\nReconstruction Embedding (CMSRE) in this paper. By exploiting correlations of\nsparse reconstruction from multiple views, CMSRE is able to learn local sparse\nstructures of nonlinear manifolds from multiple views and constructs\nsignificative low-dimensional representations for them. Due to the proposed\nco-regularized scheme, correlations of sparse reconstructions from multiple\nviews are preserved by CMSRE as much as possible. Furthermore, sparse\nrepresentation produces more meaningful correlations between features from each\nsingle view, which helps CMSRE to gain better performances.

Optical gas imaging\n(OGI) is a widely-used method to detect methane leaks, but is labor-intensive\nand cannot provide leak detection results without operators' judgment. In this\npaper, we develop a computer vision approach to OGI-based leak detection using\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN) trained on methane leak images to enable\nautomatic detection. First, we collect ~1 M frames of labeled video of methane\nleaks from different leaking equipment for building CNN model, covering a wide\nrange of leak sizes (5.3-2051.6 gCH4/h) and imaging distances (4.6-15.6 m).\nSecond, we examine different background subtraction methods to extract the\nmethane plume in the foreground. Third, we then test three CNN model variants,\ncollectively called GasNet, to detect plumes in videos taken at other pieces of\nleaking equipment. We assess the ability of GasNet to perform leak detection by\ncomparing it to a baseline method that uses optical-flow based change detection\nalgorithm. We explore the sensitivity of results to the CNN structure, with a\nmoderate-complexity variant performing best across distances. We find that the\ndetection accuracy can reach as high as 99%, the overall detection accuracy can\nexceed 95% for a case across all leak sizes and imaging distances. Binary\ndetection accuracy exceeds 97% for large leaks (~710 gCH4/h) imaged closely\n(~5-7 m). At closer imaging distances (~5-10 m), CNN-based models have greater\nthan 94% accuracy across all leak sizes. At farthest distances (~13-16 m),\nperformance degrades rapidly, but it can achieve above 95% accuracy to detect\nlarge leaks (>950 gCH4/h).
