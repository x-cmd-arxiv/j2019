Metalenses present a methodology for\nminiaturization but their strong chromatic aberrations and the lack of a\nvarifocal achromatic element limit their utility.

Prior works have suggested coordinating pilot design across cells\nin order to reduce the channel estimation error caused by pilot contamination.\nIn this paper, we propose a method for coordinated pilot design using\nfractional programming to minimize the weighted mean squared-error (MSE) in\nchannel estimation. In particular, we apply the recently proposed quadratic\ntransform to the MSE expression which allows the effect of pilot contamination\nto be decoupled. The resulting problem reformulation enables the pilots to be\noptimized in closed form if they can be designed arbitrarily.

The most plausible theories\nfor launching astrophysical jets rely on strong magnetic fields at the inner\nparts of the host accretion disks. An internal dynamo can in principle generate\nsmall scale magnetic fields in situ but generating a large scale field in a\ndisk seems a difficult task in the dynamo theories. In fact, as far as numerous\nnumerical experiments indicate, a dynamo-generated field in general would not\nbe coherent enough over the large length scales of order the disk's radius.\nInstead, a large scale poloidal field dragged in from the environment, and\ncompressed by the accretion, provides a more promising possibility. The\ndifficulty in the latter picture, however, arises from the reconnection of the\nradial field component across the mid-plane which annihilates the field faster\nthan it is dragged inward by the accretion. We review the different mechanisms\nproposed to overcome these theoretical difficulties. In fact, it turns out,\nthat a combination of different effects, including magnetic buoyancy and\nturbulent pumping, is responsible for the vertical transport of the field lines\ntoward the surface of the disk. The radial component of the poloidal field\nvanishes at the mid-plane, which efficiently impedes reconnection, and grows\nexponentially toward the surface where it can become much larger than the\nvertical field component. This allows the poloidal field to be efficiently\nadvected to small radii until the allowed bending angle drops to of order\nunity, and the field can drive a strong outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 2019 23:20:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 02:52:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

The best known algorithms for computing DTW run in near quadratic\ntime, and conditional lower bounds prohibit the existence of significantly\nfaster algorithms. The lower bounds do not prevent a faster algorithm for the\nspecial case in which the DTW is small, however. For an arbitrary metric space\n$\\Sigma$ with distances normalized so that the smallest non-zero distance is\none, we present an algorithm which computes $\\operatorname{dtw}(x, y)$ for two\nstrings $x$ and $y$ over $\\Sigma$ in time $O(n \\cdot \\operatorname{dtw}(x,\ny))$. We also present an approximation algorithm which computes\n$\\operatorname{dtw}(x, y)$ within a factor of $O(n^\\epsilon)$ in time\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{2 - \\epsilon})$ for $0 < \\epsilon < 1$. The algorithm allows for\nthe strings $x$ and $y$ to be taken over an arbitrary well-separated tree\nmetric with logarithmic depth and at most exponential aspect ratio. Extending\nour techniques further, we also obtain the first approximation algorithm for\nedit distance to work with characters taken from an arbitrary metric space,\nproviding an $n^\\epsilon$-approximation in time $\\tilde{O}(n^{2 - \\epsilon})$,\nwith high probability. Additionally, we present a simple reduction from\ncomputing edit distance to computing DTW. Applying our reduction to a\nconditional lower bound of Bringmann and K\\\"unnemann pertaining to edit\ndistance over $\\{0, 1\\}$, we obtain a conditional lower bound for computing DTW\nover a three letter alphabet (with distances of zero and one). This improves on\na previous result of Abboud, Backurs, and Williams. With a similar approach, we\nprove a reduction from computing edit distance to computing longest LCS length.\nThis means that one can recover conditional lower bounds for LCS directly from\nthose for edit distance, which was not previously thought to be the case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 01:28:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 May 2019 20:43:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-27"}

Considering that specific editing task is certainly only\nrelated to the changed attributes instead of all target attributes, our model\nselectively takes the difference between target and source attribute vectors as\ninput. Furthermore, selective transfer units are incorporated with\nencoder-decoder to adaptively select and modify encoder feature for enhanced\nattribute editing. Experiments show that our method (i.e., STGAN)\nsimultaneously improves attribute manipulation accuracy as well as perception\nquality, and performs favorably against state-of-the-arts in arbitrary facial\nattribute editing and season translation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 03:24:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

Two typical examples are local graph clustering algorithms\nthat find a cluster from a seed node with running time proportional to the size\nof the output set, and clusterability testing algorithms that decide if a graph\ncan be partitioned into a few clusters in the framework of property testing.\n  In this work, we develop sublinear time algorithms for analyzing the cluster\nstructure of graphs with noisy partial information. By using conductance based\ndefinitions for measuring the quality of clusters and the cluster structure, we\nformalize a definition of noisy clusterable graphs with bounded maximum degree.\nThe algorithm is given query access to the adjacency list to such a graph. We\nthen formalize the notion of robust clustering oracle for a noisy clusterable\ngraph, and give an algorithm that builds such an oracle in sublinear time,\nwhich can be further used to support typical queries (e.g., IsOutlier($s$),\nSameCluster($s,t$)) regarding the cluster structure of the graph in sublinear\ntime. All the answers are consistent with a partition of $G$ in which all but a\nsmall fraction of vertices belong to some good cluster. We also give a local\nreconstructor for a noisy clusterable graph that provides query access to a\nreconstructed graph that is guaranteed to be clusterable in sublinear time.

The robots can only communicate\nif they arrive at the same location at exactly the same time, i.e. they use the\nso-called face-to-face communication model. The group search time is defined as\nthe worst-case time as a function of $d$, the distance of the exit from the\norigin, when both robots can reach the exit. It has long been known that for a\nsingle robot traveling at unit speed, the search time is at least $9d-o(d)$. It\nwas shown recently that $k\\geq2$ robots traveling at unit speed also require at\nleast $9d$ group search time.\n  We investigate energy-time trade-offs in group search by two robots, where\nthe energy loss experienced by a robot traveling a distance $x$ at constant\nspeed $s$ is given by $s^2 x$. Specifically, we consider the problem of\nminimizing the total energy used by the robots, under the constraints that the\nsearch time is at most a multiple $c$ of the distance $d$ and the speed of the\nrobots is bounded by $b$. Motivation for this study is that for the case when\nrobots must complete the search in $9d$ time with maximum speed one, a single\nrobot requires at least $9d$ energy, while for two robots, all previously\nproposed algorithms consume at least $28d/3$ energy.\n  When the robots have bounded memory, we generalize existing algorithms to\nobtain a family of optimal (and in some cases nearly optimal) algorithms\nparametrized by pairs of $b,c$ values that can solve the problem for the entire\nspectrum of these pairs for which the problem is solvable. We also propose a\nnovel search algorithm, with unbounded memory, that simultaneously achieves\nsearch time $9d$ and consumes energy $8.42588d$. Our result shows that two\nrobots can search on the line in optimal time $9d$ while consuming less total\nenergy than a single robot within the same search time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 03:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-23"}

RowHammer is a prime (and perhaps\nthe first) example of how a circuit-level failure mechanism can cause a\npractical and widespread system security vulnerability. It is the phenomenon\nthat repeatedly accessing a row in a modern DRAM chip causes bit flips in\nphysically-adjacent rows at consistently predictable bit locations. RowHammer\nis caused by a hardware failure mechanism called {\\em DRAM disturbance errors},\nwhich is a manifestation of circuit-level cell-to-cell interference in a scaled\nmemory technology.\n  Researchers from Google Project Zero demonstrated in 2015 that this hardware\nfailure mechanism can be effectively exploited by user-level programs to gain\nkernel privileges on real systems. Many other follow-up works demonstrated\nother practical attacks exploiting RowHammer. In this article, we\ncomprehensively survey the scientific literature on RowHammer-based attacks as\nwell as mitigation techniques to prevent RowHammer. We also discuss what other\nrelated vulnerabilities may be lurking in DRAM and other types of memories,\ne.g., NAND flash memory or Phase Change Memory, that can potentially threaten\nthe foundations of secure systems, as the memory technologies scale to higher\ndensities. We conclude by describing and advocating a principled approach to\nmemory reliability and security research that can enable us to better\nanticipate and prevent such vulnerabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 05:21:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-23"}

Methods: Numerical simulations were\nconducted using a parallel-computing implementation of the Bloch-McConnell\nequations, examining the effect of TR, TE, flip-angle, water T$_{1}$ and\nT$_{2}$, saturation-pulse duration, power, and frequency on the discrimination\nability of CEST-MRF. A modified Euclidean-distance matching metric was\nevaluated and compared to traditional dot-product matching.

Results: Simulations for dot-product matching\ndemonstrated that the optimal flip-angle and saturation times are 30$^{\\circ}$\nand 1100 ms, respectively. The optimal maximal saturation power was 3.4 $\\mu$T\nfor concentrated solutes with a slow exchange-rate, and 5.2 $\\mu$T for dilute\nsolutes with medium-to-fast exchange-rates. Using the Euclidean-distance\nmatching metric, much lower maximum saturation powers were required (1.6 and\n2.4 $\\mu$T, respectively), with a slightly longer saturation time (1500 ms) and\n90$^{\\circ}$ flip-angle. For both matching metrics, the discrimination ability\nincreased with the repetition time.

Moreover, we derive an approach\nfrom LDFA to map explicitly a new data sample into the learned low-dimensional\nsubspace. The advantage of the LDFA method is that it learns both local and\nglobal characteristics of the data sample set: the local SCAEs capture local\ncharacteristics contained in the data set, while the global alignment\nprocedures encode the interdependencies between neighbourhoods into the final\nlow-dimensional feature representations. Experimental results on data\nvisualization, clustering and classification show that the LDFA method is\ncompetitive with several well-known dimension reduction techniques, and\nexploiting locality in deep learning is a research topic worth further\nexploring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 07:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-23"}

Specifically, we propose an\nordinal regression convolutional neural networks to map the periodicity rich\ninput representation to obtain the nominal pitch classes which drastically\nreduces the number of classes required for pitch detection unlike other deep\nlearning approaches. Further, the accurate f0 is estimated from the nominal\npitch class labels by filtering and autocorrelation. We show that the proposed\nmethod generalizes to the unseen modes of voice production and various noises\nfor large scale datasets. Also, the proposed hybrid model significantly reduces\nthe learning parameters required to train the deep model compared to other\nmethods. Furthermore,the evaluation measures showed that the proposed method is\nsignificantly better than the state-of-the-art signal processing and deep\nlearning approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 08:08:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-23"}

It is found an\ninteresting phenomenon that for the superposition and the corresponding product\nof Fock state (non-Gaussian states), their averaged quantum correlations are\nnearly same, whereas the distributions of their quantum correlations might be\ndifferent. Therefore, superpositions may affect the distributions of the\nquantum correlations. In addition, to examine how the Gaussian states affect\nthe quantum correlations, we compare the typical Gaussian states with the\nnon-Gaussian states (superpositions and products of Fock states). It is\ndiscovered that the non-Gaussian-state input could result in the quantum\ncorrelation that is either positive or negative, depending on the number of the\ninput modes and the number of the photons in each mode, whereas the\nGaussian-state input always leads to the non-negative quantum correlation.\nBesides, it is demonstrated that with the increase of the disorder strength,\nthe mean strength of the quantum correlation increases for multi-mode-state\ninputs (except for multi-mode-coherent-state inputs).

There they are for instance used to test whether\nan observed phylogenetic tree differs significantly from a tree generated by\nthe Yule model of speciation. One of the most popular indices in this regard is\nthe Colless index, which measures the degree of balance for rooted binary\ntrees. While many statistical properties of the Colless index (e.g. asymptotic\nresults for its mean and variance under different models of speciation) have\nalready been discussed in different contexts, we focus on its extremal\nproperties. While it is relatively straightforward to characterize trees with\nmaximal Colless index, the analysis of the minimal value of the Colless index\nand the characterization of trees that achieve it, are much more involved. In\nthis note, we therefore focus on the minimal value of the Colless index for any\ngiven number of leaves.

The scale invariance, which appears near the\nquantum critical region in condensed matter physics, is considered to be\nimportant for the fast decay of the OTOC. In this paper, we focus on the\none-dimensional spin-1/2 XXZ model, which exhibits quantum criticality in a\ncertain parameter region, and investigate the relationship between scrambling\nand the scale invariance. We quantify scrambling by the averaged OTOC over the\nPauli operator basis, which is related to the operator space entanglement\nentropy (OSEE). Using the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD)\nmethod, we numerically calculate time dependence of the OSEE in the early time\nregion in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the averaged OTOC decays faster\nin the gapless region than in the gapped region. In the gapless region, the\naveraged OTOC behaves in the same manner regardless of the anisotropy\nparameter. This result is consistent with the fact that the low energy\nexcitations of the gapless region belong to the same universality class as the\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquid with the central charge c = 1. Furthermore, we\nestimate c by fitting the numerical data of the OSEE with an analytical result\nof the two-dimensional conformal field theory, and confirmed that c is close to\nunity.

However, insufficient work has been\ndone in incorporating prior structural knowledge onto the learning of\nunderlying graphical models from data. Learning a graph with a specific\nstructure is essential for interpretability and identification of the\nrelationships among data. Useful structured graphs include the multi-component\ngraph, bipartite graph, connected graph, sparse graph, and regular graph. In\ngeneral, structured graph learning is an NP-hard combinatorial problem,\ntherefore, designing a general tractable optimization method is extremely\nchallenging. In this paper, we introduce a unified graph learning framework\nlying at the integration of Gaussian graphical models and spectral graph\ntheory. To impose a particular structure on a graph, we first show how to\nformulate the combinatorial constraints as an analytical property of the graph\nmatrix. Then we develop an optimization framework that leverages graph learning\nwith specific structures via spectral constraints on graph matrices. The\nproposed algorithms are provably convergent, computationally efficient, and\npractically amenable for numerous graph-based tasks. Extensive numerical\nexperiments with both synthetic and real data sets illustrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed algorithms.

For\ntwo-player social dilemmas (namely, the Prisoner's Dilemma, Snowdrift, Stag\nHunt, and Harmony), we characterize (stable) equilibrium points and\nanalytically calculate the probability of having a certain number of equilibria\nwhen the payoff entries are uniformly distributed.

In this paper, we present a first study on how\nthe workers' bounded cognitive rationality interacts with and affects the\ndecisions and performance of a multimedia crowdsourcing system. Specifically,\nwe consider a two-stage model, where a requester first determines the reward\nand the quality requirement for each task, and the workers select the tasks to\naccomplish accordingly. First, we consider the benchmark case where users are\nfully rational, and derive the requester's optimal rewards and quality\nrequirements for the tasks. Next, we focus on the more practical bounded\nrational case by modeling the workers' task selection behaviors using the\ncognitive hierarchy theory. Comparing with the fully rational benchmark, we\nshow that the requester can increase her profit by taking advantage of the\nworkers' bounded cognitive rationality, especially when the workers' population\nis large or the workers' average cognitive level is low. When the workers'\naverage cognitive level is very high, however, the equilibrium under the\npractical bounded rational model converges to that under the benchmark fully\nrational model. It is because workers at different levels make decisions\nsequentially and high cognitive level workers can accurately predict other\nusers' strategies. Under both the fully and bounded rational models, we show\nthat if workers are heterogeneous but one type of workers (either the high or\nthe low quality) dominates the platform, the requester cannot make a higher\nprofit by setting different quality requirements for different tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 12:05:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 01:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-26"}

As a\nconsequence, it is shown that for a benzenoid system the mentioned indices can\nbe computed in sub-linear time with respect to the number of vertices.\nMoreover, closed formulas for linear phenylenes are also deduced. However, our\nmain theorem is proved in a more general form and therefore, we present how it\ncan be used to compute some other topological indices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 12:45:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 2019 19:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

Depending on the choice of $W$, this problem captures factor\nanalysis, low-rank plus diagonal decomposition, robust PCA, low-rank matrix\ncompletion, low-rank plus block matrix approximation, and many problems. Many\nof these problems are NP-hard, and while some algorithms with provable\nguarantees are known, they either 1) run in time $n^{\\Omega(k^2/\\epsilon)}$ or\n2) make strong assumptions, e.g., that $A$ is incoherent or that $W$ is random.\n  In this work, we show that a common polynomial time heuristic, which simply\nsets $A$ to $0$ where $W$ is $0$, and then finds a standard low-rank\napproximation, yields bicriteria approximation guarantees for this problem.

One of the ways to alleviate this burden on\ncertain hardware platforms is quantization relying on the use of low-precision\narithmetic representation for the weights and the activations. Another popular\nmethod is the pruning of the number of filters in each layer.

One way to obtain the pressure versus volume curve is\nto calculate the total energy of the system at different temperatures.

Most stars are born\nin dense star-forming regions where the external influence of other stars,\nparticularly the most massive stars, will affect the survival and enrichment of\ntheir planet-forming discs. Simulations suggest that stellar dynamics play a\ncentral role in regulating how external feedback affects discs, but comparing\nmodels to observations requires an estimate of the initial stellar density in\nstar-forming regions. Structural analyses constrain the amount of dynamical\nevolution a star-forming region has experienced; regions that maintain\nsubstructure and do not show mass segregation are likely dynamically young, and\ntherefore close to their birth density. In this paper, we present a structural\nanalysis of two clusters in the Carina Nebula, Tr14 and Tr16.

The convolution operation however has a significant\nweakness in that it only operates on a local neighborhood, thus missing global\ninformation. Self-attention, on the other hand, has emerged as a recent advance\nto capture long range interactions, but has mostly been applied to sequence\nmodeling and generative modeling tasks. In this paper, we consider the use of\nself-attention for discriminative visual tasks as an alternative to\nconvolutions. We introduce a novel two-dimensional relative self-attention\nmechanism that proves competitive in replacing convolutions as a stand-alone\ncomputational primitive for image classification. We find in control\nexperiments that the best results are obtained when combining both convolutions\nand self-attention. We therefore propose to augment convolutional operators\nwith this self-attention mechanism by concatenating convolutional feature maps\nwith a set of feature maps produced via self-attention.

The mass hierarchy can be\nnaturally explained by suitably distributing the fermions in different\npositions along the extra dimension. Due to these different localization\npoints, the effective 4D gauge couplings of Kaluza-Klein (KK) mode gauge bosons\nto the SM fermions become non-universal. As a result, our model is severely\nconstrained by the Flavor Changing Neutral Current (FCNC) measurements.

(2) the width of the localized SM fermions\nis very narrow, leading to almost universal 4D KK-mode gauge couplings.

The\nresulting numerical algorithm is very concise and easy to use, only involving\nhighly sparse matrix operations of addition and multiplication, and no\ninversion of the Jacobian in nonlinear problems. Apart from the simple yet\nefficient iteration formula, another extraordinary feature of LVIM is that in\neach local domain, all the collocation nodes participate in the calculation\nsimultaneously, thus each local domain can be regarded as one node in\ncalculation through GPU acceleration and parallel processing. For illustration,\nthe proposed algorithm of LVIM is applied to various nonlinear problems\nincluding Blasius equations in fluid mechanics, buckled bar equations in solid\nmechanics, the Chandrasekhar equation in astrophysics, the low-Earth-orbit\nequation in orbital mechanics, etc. Using the built-in highly optimized ode45\nfunction of MATLAB as a comparison, it is found that the LVIM is not only very\naccurate, but also much faster by an order of magnitude than ode45 in all the\nnumerical examples, especially when the nonlinear terms are very complicated\nand difficult to evaluate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 02:04:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-26"}

An additional source of preference information is to use the\nratings that users provide on sets of items. The advantages of using\npreferences on sets are two-fold. First, a rating provided on a set conveys\nsome preference information about each of the set's items, which allows us to\nacquire a user's preferences for more items that the number of ratings that the\nuser provided. Second, due to privacy concerns, users may not be willing to\nreveal their preferences on individual items explicitly but may be willing to\nprovide a single rating to a set of items, since it provides some level of\ninformation hiding. This paper investigates two questions related to using\nset-level ratings in recommender systems. First, how users' item-level ratings\nrelate to their set-level ratings. Second, how collaborative filtering-based\nmodels for item-level rating prediction can take advantage of such set-level\nratings. We have collected set-level ratings from active users of Movielens on\nsets of movies that they have rated in the past. Our analysis of these ratings\nshows that though the majority of the users provide the average of the ratings\non a set's constituent items as the rating on the set, there exists a\nsignificant number of users that tend to consistently either under- or\nover-rate the sets. We have developed collaborative filtering-based methods to\nexplicitly model these user behaviors that can be used to recommend items to\nusers. Experiments on real data and on synthetic data that resembles the under-\nor over-rating behavior in the real data, demonstrate that these models can\nrecover the overall characteristics of the underlying data and predict the\nuser's ratings on individual items.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 04:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

Network Embedding (NE) methods attempt\nto resolve this by learning vector representations for the nodes, for\nsubsequent use in downstream machine learning tasks.\n  Link Prediction (LP) is one such downstream machine learning task that is an\nimportant use case and popular benchmark for NE methods. Unfortunately, while\nNE methods perform exceedingly well at this task, they are lacking in\ntransparency as compared to simpler LP approaches.\n  We introduce ExplaiNE, an approach to offer counterfactual explanations for\nNE-based LP methods, by identifying existing links in the network that explain\nthe predicted links. ExplaiNE is applicable to a broad class of NE algorithms.\nAn extensive empirical evaluation for the NE method `Conditional Network\nEmbedding' in particular demonstrates its accuracy and scalability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 08:38:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

However, to further apply AI technologies in\nreal-world context, several significant issues regarding the AI ecosystem\nshould be addressed. We identify the main issues as data privacy, ownership,\nand exchange, which are difficult to be solved with the current centralized\nparadigm of machine learning training methodology. As a result, we propose a\nnovel model training paradigm based on blockchain, named Galaxy Learning, which\naims to train a model with distributed data and to reserve the data ownership\nfor their owners. In this new paradigm, encrypted models are moved around\ninstead, and are federated once trained. Model training, as well as the\ncommunication, is achieved with blockchain and its smart contracts. Pricing of\ntraining data is determined by its contribution, and therefore it is not about\nthe exchange of data ownership. In this position paper, we describe the\nmotivation, paradigm, design, and challenges as well as opportunities of Galaxy\nLearning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 11:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-03"}

To improve the original Responsibility Sensitive\nSafety (RSS) driving strategy on the non-signalized intersection, we propose a\nnew strategy in this paper, based on right-of-way assignment (RWA). The\nperformances of RSS strategy, cooperative driving strategy, and RWA based\nstrategy are tested and compared. Testing results indicate that our strategy\nyields better traffic efficiency than RSS strategy, but not satisfying as the\ncooperative driving strategy due to the limited range of communication and the\nlack of long-term planning.

For tasks that make\npairwise comparisons between sequences, matching a given input with a\ncorresponding label, two approaches are common: Cross-encoders performing full\nself-attention over the pair and Bi-encoders encoding the pair separately. The\nformer often performs better, but is too slow for practical use. In this work,\nwe develop a new transformer architecture, the Poly-encoder, that learns global\nrather than token level self-attention features. We perform a detailed\ncomparison of all three approaches, including what pre-training and fine-tuning\nstrategies work best. We show our models achieve state-of-the-art results on\nthree existing tasks; that Poly-encoders are faster than Cross-encoders and\nmore accurate than Bi-encoders; and that the best results are obtained by\npre-training on large datasets similar to the downstream tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 02:18:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 19:07:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 20:07:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 22:53:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-27"}

We address this by\nperforming transfer learning (TL) on metaenvironments and RL on the last few\nlayers of a deep convolutional network. While the NVM stores the meta-model\nfrom TL, an on-die SRAM stores the weights of the last few layers. Thus all the\nreal-time updates via RL are carried out on the SRAM arrays.
