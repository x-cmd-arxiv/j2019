The consequent volcanic-carbon fluctuations have\nbeen proposed as a pacing mechanism for Pleistocene glacial cycles. This\nmechanism is dependant on the amplitude and lag of the mid-ocean ridge response\nto sea-level changes. Here we develop and analyse a new model for that\nresponse, eliminating some questionable assumptions made in previous work. Our\nmodel calculates the carbon flux, accounting for the thermodynamic effect of\nmantle carbon: reduction of the solidus temperature and a deeper onset of\nmelting. We analyse models forced by idealised, periodic sea level and conclude\nthat fluctuations in melting rate are the prime control on magma and carbon\nflux. We also discuss a model forced by a reconstruction of eustatic sea level\nover the past 800 kyr. It indicates that peak-to-trough variations of magma and\ncarbon flux are up to about 20% and 10% of the mean flux, respectively. Peaks\nin mid-ocean ridge emissions lag peaks in sea-level forcing by less than about\n20 kyr and the lag could well be shorter. The amplitude and lag are sensitive\nto the rate of melt segregation. The lag is much shorter than the time it takes\nfor melt to travel vertically across the melting region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 16:45:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 11:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-30"}

We address\nhigh-dimensional and complex hybrid dynamical models that represent\ncollaborative locomotion. At the high level of the control scheme, local and\nnonlinear baseline controllers, based on the virtual constraints approach, are\ndesigned to induce exponentially stable dynamic gaits. The baseline controller\nfor the leash is assumed to be a nonlinear controller that keeps the human in a\nsafe distance from the dog while following it. At the lower level, a real-time\nquadratic programming (QP) is solved for modifying the baseline controllers of\nthe robot as well as the leash to avoid obstacles. In particular, the QP\nframework is set up based on control barrier functions (CBFs) to compute\noptimal control inputs that guarantee safety while being close to the baseline\ncontrollers. The stability of the complex periodic gaits is investigated\nthrough the Poincare return map.

As the\nCO$_{core}$ undergoes a supernova explosion with the creation of a new neutron\nstar ($\\nu$NS), hypercritical accretion occurs onto the companion binary\nneutron star until it exceeds the critical mass for gravitational collapse. The\nformation of a black hole (BH) captures $10^{57}$ baryons by enclosing them\nwithin its horizon, and thus a cavity of approximately $10^{11}$ cm is formed\naround it with initial density $10^{-7}$ g/cm$^3$. A further depletion of\nbaryons in the cavity originates from the expansion of the\nelectron-positron-photon ($e^{+}e^{-}\\gamma$) plasma formed at the collapse,\nreaching a density of $10^{-14}$ g/cm$^3$ by the end of the interaction. It is\ndemonstrated here using an analytical model complemented by a hydrodynamical\nnumerical simulation that part of the $e^{+}e^{-}\\gamma$ plasma is reflected\noff the walls of the cavity. The consequent outflow and its observed properties\nare shown to coincide with the featureless emission occurring in a time\ninterval of duration $t_{rf}$, measured in the rest frame of the source,\nbetween $11$ and $20$ s of the GBM observation.

Aiming at improving performance, important\nextensions of HMM have been proposed in the literatures. One of the common key\nfeatures in these extensions is the incorporation of proper prior information.\nIn this paper, we propose a new extension of HMM, termed diversified Hidden\nMarkov Models (dHMM), which utilizes a diversity-encouraging prior over the\nstate-transition probabilities and thus facilitates more dynamic sequential\nlabellings. Specifically, the diversity is modeled by a continuous\ndeterminantal point process prior, which we apply to both unsupervised and\nsupervised scenarios. Learning and inference algorithms for dHMM are derived.\nEmpirical evaluations on benchmark datasets for unsupervised PoS tagging and\nsupervised OCR confirmed the effectiveness of dHMM, with competitive\nperformance to the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 17:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-08"}

In this work, we explore\nrelations between the chaotic dynamics of an observable and the dynamics of\ninformation (entropy) contained in this observable, focussing on a disordered\nmetal coupled to a dissipative, e.g. phononic, bath. The chaotic dynamics is\ncharacterised by Lyapunov exponents $\\lambda$, the rates of growth of\nout-of-time order correlators (OTOCs), quantities of the form $\\langle[\\hat\nA(t),\\hat B(0)]^{2}\\rangle\\propto\\exp(2\\lambda t)$, where $\\hat A$ and $\\hat B$\nare the operators of, e.g., the total current of electrons in a metallic\nquantum dot. We demonstrate that the Lyapunov exponent $\\lambda$ matches the\nrate of decay of information stored in the observable $\\langle \\hat\nA(t)\\rangle$ after applying a small perturbation with a small classical\nuncertainty. This relation suggests a way to measure Lyapunov exponents in\nexperiment. We compute both the Lyapunov exponent and the rate of decay of\ninformation microscopically in a disordered metal in the presence of a bosonic\nbath, which may, in particular, represent interactions in the system. For a\nsufficiently short range of the correlations in the bath, the exponent has the\nform $\\lambda=\\lambda_{0}-1/\\tau$, where $\\lambda_{0}$ is the\n(temperature-independent) Lyapunov exponent in the absence of the bath and\n$1/\\tau$ is the inelastic scattering rate. Our results demonstrate also the\nexistence of a transition between chaotic and non-chaotic behaviour at\n$\\lambda_{0}=1/\\tau$, which may be triggered, e.g., by changing the temperature\nof the bath.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

For example, Kepler and TESS photometric precision\nmeans we can identify Earth-sized candidates (and PLATO in the future will add\nmany long-period candidates to the list), while spectrographs such as ESPRESSO\nand EXPRES (with an aimed radial velocity precision [RV] near 10 cm/s) mean we\nwill soon reach the instrumental precision required to confirm Earth-mass\nplanets in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars.

These noise reduction strategies originate from a combination of\nempirical motivation and a theoretical understanding of the underlying physics.\nThe most recent predications indicate that stellar oscillations for Sun-like\nstars may be averaged out with tailored exposure times, while granulation may\nneed to be disentangled by inspecting its imprint on the stellar line profile\nshapes.

We discuss a\ncomplementary picture, using the relatively familiar velocity field, instead of\nthe tidal field, whose intuitive connection to the surrounding, possibly\nfaraway matter arrangement is more obscure. In this 'spin from primordial inner\nmotions' (SPIM) concept, implicit in TTT derivations but not previously\nemphasized, the angular momentum from the gravity-sourced velocity field inside\na protohalo largely cancels out, but has some excess from the aspherical\noutskirts. At first, the net spin scales according to linear theory, a sort of\ncomoving conservation of familiar angular momentum. Then, at collapse, it is\nconserved in physical coordinates. Small haloes are then typically subject to\nsecondary exchanges of angular momentum. The TTT is useful for analytic\nestimates. But a literal interpretation of the TTT is inaccurate in detail,\nwithout some implicit concepts about smoothing of the velocity and tidal\nfields. This could lead to misconceptions, for those first learning about how\ngalaxies come to spin. Protohaloes are not perfectly ellipsoidal and do not\nuniformly torque up, as in a naive interpretation of the TTT; their inner\nvelocity fields retain substantial dispersion. Furthermore, quantitatively,\ngiven initial conditions and protohalo boundaries, SPIM is more direct and\naccurate than the TTT to predict halo spins.

Recently,\nresearch interests arise in solving this problem under the more realistic and\nchallenging setting of zero-shot learning. In this paper, we investigate this\nproblem from the viewpoint of domain adaptation which we show is critical in\nimproving feature embedding in the zero-shot scenario. Based on a framework\nwhich starts with a pre-trained model on ImageNet and fine-tunes it on the\ntraining set of SBIR benchmark, we advocate the importance of preserving\npreviously acquired knowledge, e.g., the rich discriminative features learned\nfrom ImageNet, to improve the model's transfer ability. For this purpose, we\ndesign an approach named Semantic-Aware Knowledge prEservation (SAKE), which\nfine-tunes the pre-trained model in an economical way and leverages semantic\ninformation, e.g., inter-class relationship, to achieve the goal of knowledge\npreservation. Zero-shot experiments on two extended SBIR datasets, TU-Berlin\nand Sketchy, verify the superior performance of our approach. Extensive\ndiagnostic experiments validate that knowledge preserved benefits SBIR in\nzero-shot settings, as a large fraction of the performance gain is from the\nmore properly structured feature embedding for photo images.

The shape priors provide a strong cue for\nobject-like prediction, and the instance embeddings model the instance specific\nappearance information.

In order to\ninvestigate this interaction, we carried out axisymmetric general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of jets produced by a large accretion disc,\nspanning over 5 orders of magnitude in time and distance, at an unprecedented\nresolution. Supported by such a disc, the jet attains a parabolic shape,\nsimilar to the M87 galaxy jet, and the product of the Lorentz factor and the\njet half-opening angle, $\\gamma\\theta\\ll 1$, similar to values found from very\nlong baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) jets; this suggests extended discs in AGN. We find that the interaction\nbetween the jet and the ambient medium leads to the development of pinch\ninstabilities, which produce significant radial and lateral variability across\nthe jet by converting magnetic and kinetic energy into heat. Thus pinched\nregions in the jet can be detectable as radiating hotspots and may provide an\nideal site for particle acceleration. Pinching also causes gas from the ambient\nmedium to become squeezed between magnetic field lines in the jet, leading to\nenhanced mass-loading of the jet and potentially contributing to the\nspine-sheath structure observed in AGN outflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 19:19:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 May 2019 23:12:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Hence, it is desirable\nto use algorithms that, even when only a (large) subgraph is available, output\nsolutions that are close to the solutions output when the whole graph is\navailable. We formalize this idea by introducing the notion of average\nsensitivity of graph algorithms, which is the average earth mover's distance\nbetween the output distributions of an algorithm on a graph and its subgraph\nobtained by removing an edge, where the average is over the edges removed and\nthe distance between two outputs is the Hamming distance.\n  In this work, we initiate a systematic study of average sensitivity. After\nderiving basic properties of average sensitivity such as composition, we\nprovide efficient approximation algorithms with low average sensitivities for\nconcrete graph problems, including the minimum spanning forest problem, the\nglobal minimum cut problem, the minimum $s$-$t$ cut problem, and the maximum\nmatching problem. In addition, we prove that the average sensitivity of our\nglobal minimum cut algorithm is almost optimal, by showing a nearly matching\nlower bound. We also show that every algorithm for the 2-coloring problem has\naverage sensitivity linear in the number of vertices. One of the main ideas\ninvolved in designing our algorithms with low average sensitivity is the\nfollowing fact; if the presence of a vertex or an edge in the solution output\nby an algorithm can be decided locally, then the algorithm has a low average\nsensitivity, allowing us to reuse the analyses of known sublinear-time\nalgorithms and local computation algorithms (LCAs). Using this connection, we\nshow that every LCA for 2-coloring has linear query complexity, thereby\nanswering an open question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 19:29:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2019 09:18:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2020 22:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

In order to cope with this issue, in this work, we\nintroduce the problem of learning from weak labels for the task of text to\nvideo moment retrieval.

However, from a data\nsecurity perspective, the development of NDN-IoT raises several new\nauthentication challenges. In particular, NDN-IoT authentication may require\nper-packet-level signatures, thus imposing intolerably high computational and\ntime costs on the resource-poor IoT end devices. This paper proposes an\neffective solution by seamlessly integrating the lightweight and unforgeable\nphysical-layer identity (PHY-ID) into the existing NDN signature scheme for the\nmobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled NDN-IoT networks. The PHY-ID generation\nexploits the inherent signal-level device-specific radio-frequency\nimperfections of IoT devices, including the in-phase/quadrature-phase\nimbalance, and thereby avoids adding any implementation complexity to the\nconstrained IoT devices. We derive the offline maximum entropy-based\nquantization rule and propose an online two-step authentication scheme to\nimprove the accuracy of the authentication decision making. Consequently, a\ncooperative MEC device can securely execute the costly signing task on behalf\nof the authenticated IoT device in an optimal manner.

Quantifying impact also plays\na key role on social media, where impact is usually defined as the reach of a\nuser's content as captured by metrics such as the number of views, likes,\nretweets, or shares. In this paper, we study entire careers of Twitter users to\nunderstand properties of impact. We show that user impact tends to have certain\ncharacteristics: First, impact is clustered in time, such that the most\nimpactful tweets of a user appear close to each other. Second, users commonly\nhave 'hot streaks' of impact, i.e., extended periods of high-impact tweets.\nThird, impact tends to gradually build up before, and fall off after, a user's\nmost impactful tweet. We attempt to explain these characteristics using various\nproperties measured on social media, including the user's network, content,\nactivity, and experience, and find that changes in impact are associated with\nsignificant changes in these properties.

In this work, we use first-principles simulations to characterize\nthe previously unstudied thermal properties of D-graphene and T-graphene,\ntwo-dimensional carbon allotropes based upon the traditional graphene structure\nbut containing a secondary, in-plane periodicity. We find that despite very\nsimilar atomic structure and bonding strength, D-graphene and T-graphene\npossess significantly different thermal properties than that of pristine\ngraphene. At room temperature, the calculated thermal conductivity of\nD-graphene and T-graphene is 600 Wm-1K-1 and 800 Wm-1K-1 compared to over 3000\nWm-1K-1 for graphene. We attribute these distinct properties to the presence of\nnaturally occurring, low frequency optical phonon modes that display\ncharacteristics of phonon coherence and arise from a folding of the acoustic\nmodes and the associated frequency gap opening, a phenomenon also found in\nsuperlattices where an out of plane periodicity is introduced. Furthermore, we\nobserve significantly enhanced Umklapp scatterings in D- and T-graphene that\nlargely suppress the hydrodynamic phonon transport in pristine graphene. Our\nstudy presents D-graphene and T-graphene as ideal model systems to explore the\ncoherent phonon effects in 2D and demonstrates the potential of using coherent\nphonon effects to significantly modify thermal transport of 2D materials\nwithout making drastic changes to their fundamental compositions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 23:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

At\nthe classical level, the models are represented by the dynamics of a (real or\ncomplex) scalar field endowed with a potential that contains its\nself-interactions, and for this reason are generically known as scalar field\ndark matter models. Here, we revisit the properties of such a model with a cosh\npotential and compare it with other known examples in the literature. Within\nthe cosmological context, the self-interaction in the potential induces a\nradiation-like behavior at early times of the scalar field density, which is\nfollowed by a proper matter-like behavior at the onset of rapid field\noscillations around the minimum of the potential. The solutions are found by\nnumerical means, and from them we obtain information about the cosmological\nobservables up to the level of linear density perturbations. We also study the\ngeneral properties of self-gravitating objects in the non-relativistic limit\nand determine the role in them of the self-interaction obtained from the cosh\npotential. An overall conclusion is that, for the range of values in its\nparameters allowed by different constraints, a cosh potential behaves almost\nindistinguishable from the simpler quadratic one, which also means that the two\nmodels suffer the same tight constraints from cosmological and astrophysical\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 23:07:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Jun 2019 02:32:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-25"}

In recent decade, a new\nresearch field called utility-oriented mining has already attracted great\nattention. Previous studies have, however, the limitation that they rarely\nconsider the inherent correlation of items among patterns. Consider the\npurchase behaviors of consumer, a high-utility group of products (w.r.t.\nmulti-products) may contain several very high-utility products with some\nlow-utility products. However, it is considered as a valuable pattern even if\nthis behavior/pattern may be not highly correlated, or even happen by chance.\nIn this paper, in light of these challenges, we propose an efficient utility\nmining approach namely non-redundant Correlated high-Utility Pattern Miner\n(CoUPM) by taking positive correlation and profitable value into account. The\nderived patterns with high utility and strong positive correlation can lead to\nmore insightful availability than those patterns only have high profitable\nvalues. The utility-list structure is revised and applied to store necessary\ninformation of both correlation and utility. Several pruning strategies are\nfurther developed to improve the efficiency for discovering the desired\npatterns. Experimental results show that the non-redundant correlated\nhigh-utility patterns have more effectiveness than some other kinds of\ninteresting patterns. Moreover, efficiency of the proposed CoUPM algorithm\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Apr 2019 01:54:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 2019 03:23:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-13"}

In this review we discuss the mass feeding mechanisms that lead to this\ngrowth in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), focusing on constraints derived from\nobservations of their environment, from extragalactic down to galactic and\nnuclear scales. At high AGN luminosities, galaxy mergers and interactions play\nan important role in AGN triggering and feeding. However, gas chaotic cold\naccretion (CCA) in galaxy clusters can trigger radiatively inefficient AGNs in\nbrightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). At lower luminosities, minor mergers feed\nAGN in early-type, gas-starving galaxies, while secular processes dominate in\nlater-type, gas-rich galaxies. While bars do not appear to directly feed AGNs,\nAGN flickering leads to the dissociation of small and large scales, hence\naffecting the interpretation of cause and effect. At ~ 100 pc scales, recent\nobservations have revealed compact disks and inflows along nuclear gaseous\nspirals and bars, while CCA continues to feed BCGs at these scales.

Some researchers resort to human judgment experimentation for\nassessing response quality, which is expensive, time consuming, and not\nscalable. Moreover, judges tend to evaluate a small number of dialogues,\nmeaning that minor differences in evaluation configuration may lead to\ndissimilar results. In this paper, we present interpretable metrics for\nevaluating topic coherence by making use of distributed sentence\nrepresentations. Furthermore, we introduce calculable approximations of human\njudgment based on conversational coherence by adopting state-of-the-art\nentailment techniques.

The prevalence of deep learning has\nlargely boosted the object counting accuracy on several benchmark datasets.\nHowever, does the global counts really count? Armed with this question we dive\ninto the predicted density map whose summation over the whole regions reports\nthe global counts for more in-depth analysis. We observe that the object\ndensity map generated by most existing methods usually lacks of local\nconsistency, i.e., counting errors in local regions exist unexpectedly even\nthough the global count seems to well match with the ground-truth. Towards this\nproblem, in this paper we propose a constrained multi-stage Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) to jointly pursue locally consistent density map from\ntwo aspects. Different from most existing methods that mainly rely on the\nmulti-column architectures of plain CNNs, we exploit a stacking formulation of\nplain CNNs. Benefited from the internal multi-stage learning process, the\nfeature map could be repeatedly refined, allowing the density map to approach\nthe ground-truth density distribution. For further refinement of the density\nmap, we also propose a grid loss function. With finer local-region-based\nsupervisions, the underlying model is constrained to generate locally\nconsistent density values to minimize the training errors considering both the\nglobal and local counts accuracy.

The proposed designed of the\nmetamaterial absorber consists of photoresist disk arrays on a silicon\nsubstrate followed by the deposition of a tri layer of Au, ZnS and Au on the\ntop of the structure. Due to the tri layer, there is a formation of a cavity\nbetween the substrate and gold layer on the top of photoresist disk and a\nwaveguide in the ZnS layer in between the gold layers on the substrate and the\nZnS layer itself. The Fano like resonance arises due to the interference of the\ncavity mode and the guided-mode resonance as well as the Woods anomaly. The\ncavity mode resonance works as continuum mode whereas the guided mode resonance\nand Woods anomaly work as discrete modes. The spectral position of the\nresonance can be tuned by just controlling the thickness of the tri layer\ninstead of the structural size and shape modification of the micro and\nnano-structures as usually done in conventional metamaterial absorbers.

The experiment we propose is a wide field of view\nobservatory (2{\\pi} of local observation) in the energy range from tens of keV\nto few MeV designed to fly with International Space Station (ISS). The motion\nalong the ISS orbit will allow the experiment to scan the sky at 4? in 90\nminutes. The Crystal Eye objectives will be: to alert the community about\nevents containing X-rays and low energy gamma-rays, to monitor long-term\nvariabilities of X-ray sources, to stimulate multi-wavelength observations of\nvariable objects, and to observe diffuse cosmic X-ray emissions. With its\ncharacteristics, Crystal Eye will provide the continuous exploration and\nmonitoring of the Universe after a Gravitational Wave event with a better\nresolution than Fermi GBM. Thanks to its large field of view and its design, it\nhas the potentiality to be the trigger for those present X ray-astronomy\nmissions (Chandra, Swift, Integral XMM Newton) that are based on high angular\nresolution pointing experiment but that have unfortunately a very small field\nof view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Apr 2019 08:46:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 18:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

To prevent large\nneural network models from overfitting, dropout has been widely used as an\nefficient regularization technique in practice.

In this paper, we revisit this issue and examine various dropout variants\nin an attempt to improve existing dropout-based regularization techniques for\nCNNs. We attribute the failure of standard dropout to the conflict between the\nstochasticity of dropout and its following Batch Normalization (BN), and\npropose to reduce the conflict by placing dropout operations right before the\nconvolutional operation instead of BN, or totally address this issue by\nreplacing BN with Group Normalization (GN). We further introduce a structurally\nmore suited dropout variant Drop-Conv2d, which provides more efficient and\neffective regularization for deep CNNs. These dropout variants can be readily\nintegrated into the building blocks of CNNs and implemented in existing deep\nlearning platforms. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including\nCIFAR, SVHN and ImageNet are conducted to compare the existing building blocks\nand the proposed ones with dropout training.

However, accurate\nprediction of arrival time of buses is still a challenging problem in\ndynamically varying traffic conditions especially under heterogeneous traffic\ncondition without lane discipline. One broad approach researchers have adopted\nover the years is to segment the entire bus route into segments and work with\nthese segment travel times as the data input (from GPS traces) for prediction.\nThis paper adopts this approach and proposes predictive modelling approaches\nwhich fully exploit the temporal correlations in the bus GPS data.\nSpecifically, we propose two approaches: (a) classical time-series approach\nemploying a seasonal AR model (b)unconventional linear, non-stationary AR\napproach. The second approach is a novel technique and exploits the notion of\npartial correlation for learning from data. A detailed analysis of the marginal\ndistributions of the data from Indian conditions (used here), revealed a\npredominantly log-normal behavior. This aspect was incorporated into the above\nproposed predictive models and statistically optimal prediction schemes in the\nlognormal sense are utilized for all predictions. Both the above temporal\npredictive modeling approaches predict ahead in time at each segment\nindependently. For real-time bus travel time prediction, one however needs to\npredict across multiple segments ahead in space. Towards a complete solution,\nthe study also proposes an intelligent procedure to perform (real-time)\nmulti-section ahead travel-time predictions based on either of the above\nproposed temporal models.

To this problem,\none of the most widely applied solution paradigms is the sample average\napproximation (SAA), which uses the average cost over sampled scenarios as a\nsurrogate to approximate the expected cost. Traditional SAA theories require\nthe sample size to grow rapidly when the problem dimensionality increases.\nIndeed, for a problem of optimizing over a $p$-by-$p$ matrix, the sample\ncomplexity of the SAA is given by $\\tilde O(1)\\cdot\n\\frac{p^2}{\\epsilon^2}\\cdot{polylog}(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$ to achieve an\n$\\epsilon$-suboptimality gap, for some poly-logarithmic function\n${polylog}(\\,\\cdot\\,)$ and some quantity $\\tilde O(1)$ independent of\ndimensionality $p$ and sample size $n$. In contrast, this paper considers a\nregularized SAA (RSAA) with a low-rankness-inducing penalty. We demonstrate\nthat the sample complexity of RSAA is $\\tilde O(1)\\cdot\n\\frac{p}{\\epsilon^3}\\cdot {polylog}(p,\\,\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$, which is almost\nlinear in $p$ and thus indicates a substantially lower dependence on\ndimensionality. Therefore, RSAA can be more advantageous than SAA especially\nfor larger scale and higher dimensional problems. Due to the close\ncorrespondence between stochastic programming and statistical learning, our\nresults also indicate that high-dimensional low-rank matrix recovery is\npossible generally beyond a linear model, even if the common assumption of\nrestricted strong convexity is completely absent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Apr 2019 14:11:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 01:13:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 20:28:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-22"}

More specifically, it is used to identify areas in the\ngraph of increasing centrality and connectedness, and it allows to reveal the\nstructural organization of the graph.\n  Despite the fact that $k$-core analysis relies on vertex degrees, $k$-cores\ndo not satisfy a certain, rather natural, density property. Simply put, the\nmost central $k$-core is not necessarily the densest subgraph. This\ninconsistency between $k$-cores and graph density provides the basis of our\nstudy.\n  We start by defining what it means for a subgraph to be locally-dense, and we\nshow that our definition entails a nested chain decomposition of the graph,\nsimilar to the one given by $k$-cores, but in this case the components are\narranged in order of increasing density. We show that such a locally-dense\ndecomposition for a graph $G=(V,E)$ can be computed in polynomial time.

A strong centrifugal force is a\nlikely contributor to Ryugu's top-shaped features. Observations by Optical\nNavigation Camera onboard Hayabusa2 show a unique longitudinal variation in\ngeomorphology; the western side of this asteroid, later called the western\nbulge, has a smooth surface and a sharp equatorial ridge, compared to the other\nside. Here, we propose a structural deformation process that generated the\nwestern bulge. Applying the mission-derived shape model, we employ a finite\nelement model technique to analyze the locations that experience structural\nfailure within the present shape. Assuming that materials are uniformly\ndistributed, our model shows the longitudinal variation in structurally failed\nregions when the spin period is shorter than ~3.75 h. Ryugu is structurally\nintact in the subsurface region of the western bulge while other regions are\nsensitive to structural failure. We infer that this variation is indicative of\nthe deformation process that occurred in the past, and the western bulge is\nmore relaxed structurally than the other region. Our analysis also shows that\nthis deformation process might occur at a spin period between ~3.5 h and ~3.0\nh, providing the cohesive strength ranging between ~4 Pa and ~10 Pa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Apr 2019 15:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

This article discusses the unique needs of pediatric\nophthalmology patients and how AI techniques can address these challenges,\nsurveys recent applications of AI to pediatric ophthalmology, and discusses\nfuture directions in the field.\n  RECENT FINDINGS: The most significant advances involve the automated\ndetection of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), yielding results that rival\nexperts. Machine learning (ML) has also been successfully applied to the\nclassification of pediatric cataracts, prediction of post-operative\ncomplications following cataract surgery, detection of strabismus and\nrefractive error, prediction of future high myopia, and diagnosis of reading\ndisability via eye tracking. In addition, ML techniques have been used for the\nstudy of visual development, vessel segmentation in pediatric fundus images,\nand ophthalmic image synthesis.\n  SUMMARY: AI applications could significantly benefit clinical care for\npediatric ophthalmology patients by optimizing disease detection and grading,\nbroadening access to care, furthering scientific discovery, and improving\nclinical efficiency. These methods need to match or surpass physician\nperformance in clinical trials before deployment with patients. Due to\nwidespread use of closed-access data sets and software implementations, it is\ndifficult to directly compare the performance of these approaches, and\nreproducibility is poor. Open-access data sets and software implementations\ncould alleviate these issues, and encourage further AI applications to\npediatric ophthalmology.\n  KEYWORDS: pediatric ophthalmology, machine learning, artificial intelligence,\ndeep learning\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Apr 2019 01:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-19"}

Therefore, the deleterious effect of arsenic can be mitigated by\nquenching ROS using antioxidants. There is a homology between the protein\ncoding regions of mice and human. Effect of these alterations in human can be\nmimicked in mice. Therefore to understand the underlying mechanism of arsenic\ntoxicity and its amelioration by black tea, studies have been conducted in mice\nmodel. Long term exposure to iAs leads to tumour growth, which has been found\nto be alleviated by black tea. Observations reveal that black tea has two\nsalutary effects on the growth of tumour: the rate of growth of damaged cells\nwas appreciably reduced and an early saturation of the level of damage is\nachieved. To take the experimental findings further, the experimental data have\nbeen modelled with simple dynamical equations. The curves obtained from\n\\textit{in vivo} studies have been fitted with the data obtained from the\nmodel. The corresponding steady states and their stabilities are analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 17:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

Feature Model (FM) is the most important technique used to manage\nthe variability through products in Software Product Lines (SPLs). Often, the\nSPLs requirements variability is by using variable use case model which is a\nreal challenge in actual approaches: large gap between their concepts and those\nof real world leading to bad quality, poor supporting FM, and the variability\ndoes not cover all requirements modeling levels. Aims. This paper proposes a\nbio-inspired use case variability modeling methodology dealing with the above\nshortages. Method. The methodology is carried out through variable business\ndomain use case meta modeling, variable applications family use case meta\nmodeling, and variable specific application use case generating. Results. This\nmethodology has leaded to integrated solutions to the above challenges: it\ndecreases the gap between computing concepts and real world ones. It supports\nuse case variability modeling by introducing versions and revisions features\nand related relations. The variability is supported at three meta levels\ncovering business domain, applications family, and specific application\nrequirements. Conclusion. A comparative evaluation with the closest recent\nworks, upon some meaningful criteria in the domain, shows the conceptual and\npractical great value of the proposed methodology and leads to promising\nresearch perspectives\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 2019 18:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-29"}
