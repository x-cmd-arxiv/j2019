Whilst the traditional spiral sequence is based on a combination of\nboth measures, and is supposed to favour arm winding where disagreement exists,\nwe demonstrate that, in modern usage, the spiral classifications Sa-Sd are\npredominantly based on bulge size, with no reference to spiral arms.\nFurthermore, in a volume limited sample of galaxies with both automated and\nvisual measures of bulge prominence and spiral arm tightness, there is at best\na weak correlation between the two. Galaxies with small bulges have a wide\nrange of arm winding, while those with larger bulges favour tighter arms. This\nobservation, interpreted as revealing a variable winding speed as a function of\nbulge size, may be providing evidence that the majority of spiral arms are not\nstatic density waves, but rather wind-up over time. This suggests the \"winding\nproblem\" could be solved by the constant reforming of spiral arms, rather than\nneeding a static density wave. We further observe that galaxies exhibiting\nstrong bars tend have more loosely wound arms at a given bulge size than\nunbarred spirals. This observations suggests that the presence of a bar may\nslow the winding speed of spirals, and may also drive other processes (such as\ndensity waves) which generate spiral arms.

In the mean time,\nthese electrons should inevitably radiate X-ray photons via the synchrotron\nradiation, providing a useful constraint on the magnetic field in the TeV halo.\nIn this work, we analyse the data of XMM-Newton and Chandra, and obtain an\nupper limit for the diffuse X-ray flux in a region of $600''$ around the\nGeminga pulsar, which is at a level of $\\lesssim 10^{-14}\\rm\nerg\\,cm^{-2}s^{-1}$.

DNA supercoiling may lead to\nthe formation of braided superstructures (plectonemes), or it may locally\ndestabilize canonical B-DNA to generate denaturation bubbles, left-handed Z-DNA\nand other functional alternative forms. Prediction of the relative fraction of\nthese structures has been limited because of a lack of predictive polymer\nmodels that can capture the multiscale properties of long DNA molecules. In\nthis work, we address this issue by extending the self-avoiding rod-like chain\nmodel of DNA so that every site of the chain is allocated with an additional\nstructural degree of freedom reflecting variations of DNA forms. Efficient\nsimulations of the model reveal its relevancy to capture multiscale properties\nof long chains (here up to 21 kb) as reported in magnetic tweezers experiments.\nWell-controlled approximations further lead to accurate analytical estimations\nof thermodynamic properties in the high force regime, providing, in combination\nwith experiments, a simple, yet powerful framework to infer physical parameters\ndescribing alternative forms. In this regard, using simulated data, we find\nthat extension curves at forces above 2 pN may lead, alone, to erroneous\nparameter estimations as a consequence of an underdetermination problem.

In particular, there is\nconsiderable evidence for Kondo destruction: a disappearance of the static\nKondo singlet amplitude that results in a sudden reconstruction of Fermi\nsurface across the quantum critical point and an extra critical energy scale.\nThis effect can be analyzed in terms of a dynamical interplay between the Kondo\nand RKKY interactions. In the Kondo-destroyed phase, a well-defined Kondo\nresonance is lost, but Kondo singlet correlations remain at nonzero\nfrequencies. This dynamical effect allows for mass enhancement in the\nKondo-destroyed phase.

We propose a\nscenario in which the gravitational collapse of large inhomogeneities at the\nquark-hadron epoch generates both the baryon asymmetry and dark matter in the\nform of primordial black holes (PBHs). This is due to the sudden drop in\nradiation pressure during the transition from a quark-gluon plasma to\nnon-relativistic hadrons. The collapse to a PBH is induced by fluctuations of a\nlight spectator scalar field in rare regions and is accompanied by the violent\nexpulsion of surrounding material, which might be regarded as a sort of\n\"primordial supernova\" . The acceleration of protons to relativistic speeds\nprovides the ingredients for efficient baryogenesis around the collapsing\nregions and its subsequent propagation to the rest of the Universe. This\nscenario naturally explains why the observed BAU is of order the PBH collapse\nfraction and why the baryons and dark matter have comparable densities. The\npredicted PBH mass distribution ranges from sub-solar to several hundred solar\nmasses.

The primary focus of our analysis, however, is an extensive set of\ntime-series photometry obtained between 2002 and 2018, with particularly\nintensive coverage of the 2016-2018 low states. After computing an updated spin\nephemeris for the white dwarf (WD), we show that its spin period began to\nincrease in 2014 after having spent 27 years decreasing; no other intermediate\npolar has experienced a sign change of its period derivative, but FO Aqr has\nnow done so twice. Our central finding is that the recent low states all\noccurred shortly after the WD began to spin down, even though no low states\nwere reported in the preceding quarter-century, when it was spinning up.\nAdditionally, the system's mode of accretion is extremely sensitive to the\nmass-transfer rate, with accretion being almost exclusively disk-fed when FO\nAqr is brighter than V~14 and substantially stream-fed when it is not. Even in\nthe low states, a grazing eclipse remains detectable, confirming the presence\nof a disk-like structure (but not necessarily a Keplerian accretion disk). We\nrelate these various observations to theoretical predictions that during the\nlow state, the system's accretion disk dissipates into a non-Keplerian ring of\ndiamagnetic blobs. Finally, a new XMM-Newton observation from a high state in\n2017 reveals an anomalously soft X-ray spectrum and diminished X-ray luminosity\ncompared to pre-2016 observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2020 18:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

These two reconnection-related phenomena, nominally\nformed far apart, occasionally occur in the same location and at the same time,\nthus challenging our understanding of reconnection and heating of the lower\nsolar atmosphere. We consider the formation of an active region, including long\nfibrils and hot and dense coronal plasma. The emergence of a untwisted magnetic\nflux sheet, injected $2.5$~Mm below the photosphere, is studied as it pierces\nthe photosphere and interacts with the preexisting ambient field. Specifically,\nwe aim to study whether EBs and UV bursts are generated as a result of such\nflux emergence and examine their physical relationship. The Bifrost radiative\nmagnetohydrodynamics code was used to model flux emerging into a model\natmosphere that contained a fairly strong ambient field, constraining the\nemerging field to a limited volume wherein multiple reconnection events occur\nas the field breaks through the photosphere and expands into the outer\natmosphere. Synthetic spectra of the different reconnection events were\ncomputed using the $1.5$D RH code and the fully 3D MULTI3D code. The formation\nof UV bursts and EBs at intensities and with line profiles that are highly\nreminiscent of observed spectra are understood to be a result of the\nreconnection of emerging flux with itself in a long-lasting current sheet that\nextends over several scale heights through the chromosphere. Synthetic\ndiagnostics suggest that there are no compelling reasons to assume that UV\nbursts occur in the photosphere. Instead, EBs and UV bursts are occasionally\nformed at opposite ends of a long current sheet that resides in an extended\nbubble of cool gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 18:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

Lately, embedding techniques that produce\nlow-dimensional representations of ad IDs drastically improve CTR prediction\naccuracies. However, such learning techniques are data demanding and work\npoorly on new ads with little logging data, which is known as the cold-start\nproblem.\n  In this paper, we aim to improve CTR predictions during both the cold-start\nphase and the warm-up phase when a new ad is added to the candidate pool. We\npropose Meta-Embedding, a meta-learning-based approach that learns to generate\ndesirable initial embeddings for new ad IDs. The proposed method trains an\nembedding generator for new ad IDs by making use of previously learned ads\nthrough gradient-based meta-learning. In other words, our method learns how to\nlearn better embeddings. When a new ad comes, the trained generator initializes\nthe embedding of its ID by feeding its contents and attributes. Next, the\ngenerated embedding can speed up the model fitting during the warm-up phase\nwhen a few labeled examples are available, compared to the existing\ninitialization methods.\n  Experimental results on three real-world datasets showed that Meta-Embedding\ncan significantly improve both the cold-start and warm-up performances for six\nexisting CTR prediction models, ranging from lightweight models such as\nFactorization Machines to complicated deep models such as PNN and DeepFM.

The\nfar-away from equilibrium dynamics are investigated by employing $m$-body\ndensity matrices, which are most conveniently defined in terms of a special\nbasis - the conformal tower states. We explicitly illustrate that, although\nduring the initial stage of the dynamics all symmetries can be broken and\nabsent in the unitary evolution because of the initialization of the state,\nthere is always an emergent conformal symmetry in the long time limit. The\nemergence of this dynamic conformal symmetry is robust, and always occurs; it\nuniquely defines the characteristics of the asymptotic dynamics at a scale\ninvariant fixed point. As an immediate application of the asymptotic dynamics\nof the microscopic density matrices, we have focused on the effects of this\nemergent conformal symmetry on two observables: the moment of inertia tensor,\n$I_{ij}(t)$, $i,j=x,y,z$, and the entropy density field, $S({\\bf r}, t)$, in\nthe hydrodynamic flow of strongly interacting particles. We show that the long\ntime behaviour of these observables is completely set by conformal symmetry,\nwhile the leading long time corrections depend on interference effects between\ndifferent conformal tower states. The emergent conformal symmetry naturally\nleads to entropy conservation, and {\\em conformal cooling}, an energy\nconserving cooling of a strongly interacting gas during free expansion. When\nthe interaction Hamiltonian breaks the scale symmetry, we further demonstrate\nthat there is a direct cause-effect relation between conformal symmetry\nbreaking in the long time limit, and a non-vanishing entropy production.

This paper examines the effect of fluid rotation on the\nRayleigh-Taylor (RT) driven growth of perturbations at the inner surface of an\nimploding cylindrical liquid shell which compresses a gas-filled cavity. The\nshell was formed by rotating water in solid body rotation prior to the\npiston-driven implosion, which was propelled by a modest external gas pressure.\nThe fast rise in pressure in the gas-filled cavity at the point of maximum\nconvergence results in an RT unstable configuration where the cavity surface\naccelerates in the direction of the density gradient at the interface. The\nexperimental arrangement allowed for visualization of the cavity surface during\nthe implosion using high-speed videography, while offering the possibility to\nprovide geometrically similar implosions over a wide range of initial angular\nvelocities such that the effect of rotation on the interface stability could be\nquantified. A model developed for the growth of perturbations on the inner\nsurface indicated that the RT instability may be suppressed by rotating the\nliquid shell at a sufficient angular velocity so that the net surface\nacceleration remains opposite to the interface density gradient throughout the\nimplosion. Rotational stabilisation of high-mode-number perturbation growth was\nexamined by collapsing nominally smooth cavities and demonstrating the\nsuppression of spray-like perturbations that appear on RT unstable cavity\nsurfaces. Experiments observing the evolution of low-mode-number perturbations,\nprescribed using a mode-6 obstacle plate, showed that the RT-driven growth was\nsuppressed by rotation, while geometric growth remained along with significant\nnon-linear distortion of the perturbations near final convergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 20:58:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-29"}

The Hough transform maps a point in\nthe time-frequency data to a straight line in the parameter space, and points\non the same dispersed $f^{-2}$ curve to a bundle of lines all crossing at the\nsame point, thus the curve is transformed to a single point in the parameter\nspace, enabling an easier way for the detection of radio burst. By choosing an\nappropriate truncation threshold, in a reasonably radio quiet environment, i.e.\nwith radio frequency interferences (RFIs) present but not dominant, the\ncomputing speed of the method is very fast. Using simulation data of different\nnoise levels, we studied how the detected peak varies with different truncation\nthresholds.

Therefore, the design of effective\ntraining methods that require small labeled training sets is an important\nresearch direction that will allow a more effective use of resources.Among\ncurrent approaches designed to address this issue, two are particularly\ninteresting: data augmentation and active learning. Data augmentation achieves\nthis goal by artificially generating new training points, while active learning\nrelies on the selection of the \"most informative\" subset of unlabeled training\nsamples to be labelled by an oracle. Although successful in practice, data\naugmentation can waste computational resources because it indiscriminately\ngenerates samples that are not guaranteed to be informative, and active\nlearning selects a small subset of informative samples (from a large\nun-annotated set) that may be insufficient for the training process.

For weak\nsystem-bath coupling, the fluctuations around a deterministic base path obey\nGaussian statistics, where we assume that the quantum adiabatic theorem is also\nsatisfied for fluctuating paths. We show that universal non-Abelian geometric\ndephasing (NAGD) contributions are contained in the fluctuation-averaged\nevolution operator. This operator plays a key role in all experimental\nprotocols proposed in this work for the detection of NAGD. In particular, we\nformulate interference measurements providing full access to NAGD.

A polar decomposition of this\nnon-unitary matrix into the product of a unitary, $V$, and a positive\nsemi-definite Hermitian matrix, $R$, reveals the physics of the NAGD\ncontributions. Unlike the conventional dynamic dephasing rate, the NAGD\neigenrates encoded by $R$ depend on the loop orientation sense and, in\nparticular, change sign under a reversal of the direction. A negative rate then\nimplies amplification of coherences as compared to the ones when only dynamic\ndephasing is present. The non-Abelian character of geometric dephasing is\nrooted in the non-commutativity of $V$ and $R$ and causes smoking-gun\nsignatures in interference experiments.

However, the performance of FCN based models\nseverely rely on the amounts of pixel-level annotations which are expensive and\ntime-consuming. To address this problem, it is a good choice to learn to\nsegment with weak supervision from bounding boxes. How to make full use of the\nclass-level and region-level supervisions from bounding boxes is the critical\nchallenge for the weakly supervised learning task. In this paper, we first\nintroduce a box-driven class-wise masking model (BCM) to remove irrelevant\nregions of each class. Moreover, based on the pixel-level segment proposal\ngenerated from the bounding box supervision, we could calculate the mean\nfilling rates of each class to serve as an important prior cue, then we propose\na filling rate guided adaptive loss (FR-Loss) to help the model ignore the\nwrongly labeled pixels in proposals. Unlike previous methods directly training\nmodels with the fixed individual segment proposals, our method can adjust the\nmodel learning with global statistical information. Thus it can help reduce the\nnegative impacts from wrongly labeled proposals. We evaluate the proposed\nmethod on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark and compare with other\nmethods.

At first glance, it might appear that what the training sector needs\nis the most realistic simulators possible, but traditional simulators are not\nnecessarily the most efficient or practical training tools. With all that these\nnew technologies have to offer; the challenge is to go back to the core of\ntraining needs and identify the right vector of sensory cues that will most\neffectively enable training mode in the human brain.

The color electric field has its intimate association with the\nvector mode of the magnetically condensed QCD vacuum and such field\nconfigurations have been analyzed to show that the color electric flux gets\nlocalized towards the poles for a large sphere case while it gets uniformly\ndistributed for the small sphere case in the infrared sector of QCD.

In polymer-based\norganic photovoltaic devices, it is commonly used to study compositional\nvariations across the interfaces of the organic active layer with charge\nextraction layers or electrodes, as well as the vertical phase separation\nwithin the bulk-heterojunction active layer. It is generally considered that\nthe damage induced by the etching of organic layers is limited to the very top\nsurface, such that the XPS signal (acquired from the top ~10 nm of the layer)\nremains largely unaffected, allowing for a reliable measurement of the sample\ncomposition throughout the depth profile.

We use the Network Fundamental Diagram\n(NFD) to monitor the network traffic state over time and consider different\ntrip lengths in the toll calculation. The first model is a distance toll that\nis linearly related to the distance traveled within the cordon. The second\nmodel is an improved joint distance and time toll (JDTT) whereby users are\ncharged jointly in proportion to the distance traveled and time spent within\nthe cordon. The third model is a further improved joint distance and delay toll\n(JDDT) which replaces the time toll in the JDTT with a delay toll component. To\nsolve the optimal toll level problem, we develop a simulation-based\noptimization (SBO) framework. Specifically, we propose a simultaneous approach\nand a sequential approach, respectively, based on the proportional-integral\n(PI) feedback controller to iteratively adjust the JDTT and JDDT, and use a\ncalibrated large-scale simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model\nof Melbourne, Australia to evaluate the network performance under different\npricing scenarios. While the framework is developed for static pricing, we show\nthat it can be easily extended to solve time-dependent pricing by using\nmultiple PI controllers. Results show that although the distance toll keeps the\nnetwork from entering the congested regime of the NFD, it naturally drives\nusers into the shortest paths within the cordon resulting in an uneven\ndistribution of congestion. This is reflected by a large clockwise hysteresis\nloop in the NFD. In contrast, both the JDTT and JDDT reduce the size of the\nhysteresis loop while achieving the same control objective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 10:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-24"}

A DTEM is mainly known to be\nvalid for structured data; however, like other machine-learning models, it is\ndifficult to train so that it returns the correct output value for any input\nvalue. Accordingly, when a DTEM is used in regard to a system that requires\nreliability, it is important to comprehensively detect input values that lead\nto malfunctions of a system (failures) during development and take appropriate\nmeasures. One conceivable solution is to install an input filter that controls\nthe input to the DTEM, and to use separate software to process input values\nthat may lead to failures. To develop the input filter, it is necessary to\nspecify the filtering condition of the input value that leads to the\nmalfunction of the system.

The use of TRS codes in the McEliece cryptosystem has\nbeen motivated by the fact that a large subfamily of TRS codes is resilient to\na direct use of known algebraic key-recovery methods.

We explored\nthe multiscale organization of human connectomes using datasets of healthy\nsubjects reconstructed at five different resolutions. We found that the\nstructure of the human brain remains self-similar when the resolution of\nobservation is progressively decreased by hierarchical coarse-graining of the\nanatomical regions. Strikingly, a geometric network model, where distances are\nnot Euclidean, predicts the multiscale properties of connectomes, including\nself-similarity. The model relies on the application of a geometric\nrenormalization protocol which decreases the resolution by coarse-graining and\naveraging over short similarity distances.

The probabilistic inference is a fundamental problem\nrelated to graphical models, and sampling is a main approach for the problem.\nIn this paper, we study probabilistic inference problems when the graphical\nmodel itself is changing dynamically with time. Such dynamic inference problems\narise naturally in today's application, e.g.~multivariate time-series data\nanalysis and practical learning procedures.\n  We give a dynamic algorithm for sampling-based probabilistic inferences in\nMRFs, where each dynamic update can change the underlying graph and all\nparameters of the MRF simultaneously, as long as the total amount of changes is\nbounded. More precisely, suppose that the MRF has $n$ variables and\npolylogarithmic-bounded maximum degree, and $N(n)$ independent samples are\nsufficient for the inference for a polynomial function $N(\\cdot)$. Our\nalgorithm dynamically maintains an answer to the inference problem using\n$\\widetilde{O}(n N(n))$ space cost, and $\\widetilde{O}(N(n) + n)$ incremental\ntime cost upon each update to the MRF, as long as the well-known\nDobrushin-Shlosman condition is satisfied by the MRFs.

Therefore, the purpose of this work was to\ninvestigate the usefulness of multispectral PA imaging in assessing sO2 in a\ngyrencephalic brain.

We aim to investigate the ionisation conditions and distances of\nGalactic high-velocity clouds (HVCs) in the Galactic halo and beyond in the\ndirection of the Local Group (LG) barycentre and anti-barycentre, by studying\nspectral data of 29 extragalactic background sources obtained with Cosmic\nOrigins Spectropgraph (COS) installed on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).\nMethods. We model column-densities of low, intermediate, and high ions, such as\nSi II, C II, Si III, Si IV, and C IV and use this to construct a set of Cloudy\nionisation models. Results. In total, we found 69 high-velocity absorption\ncomponents along the 29 lines of sight. The ones in the direction of the LG\nbarycentre span the entire range of studied velocities, 100 \\lesssim\n|v_{LSR}|\\lesssim 400 km s^-1, while the anti-barycentre sample has velocities\nup to about 300 km s^-1. For 49 components, we infer the gas densities. In the\ndirection of the LG barycentre, the gas densities exhibit a large range between\nlog n_H=-3.96 to -2.55, while in the anti-barycentre direction the densities\nare systematically higher, log n_H>-3.25. The barycentre absorbers can be split\ninto two groups based on their density: a high density group with log\nn_H>-3.54, which can be affected by the Milky Way radiation field, and a low\ndensity group (log n_H \\leq -3.54). The latter has very low thermal pressures\nof P/k<7.3 K cm^-3. Conclusions. Our study shows that part of the absorbers in\nthe LG barycentre direction trace gas at very low gas densities and thermal\npressures. Such properties indicate that these absorbers are located beyond the\nvirial radius of the Milky Way. Our study also confirms results from earlier,\nsingle-sightline studies, suggesting the presence of a metal-enriched\nintragroup medium filling the LG near its barycentre.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 12:59:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

Periodic variations of the Earth's rotation axis\n(nutations) can lead to an exchange of angular momentum between the mantle and\nthe fluid core and excite these inertial modes. In addition to viscous torques\nthat exist regardless of the shape of the boundaries, the small flattening of\nthe core-mantle boundary (CMB) allows inertial modes to exert pressure torques\non the mantle.

These skills are obtained thanks to two\nmajor features: (i) the possibility to alternate between the standard\ngeneration mechanism and a copy one, which allows to directly copy input facts\nto produce outputs, and (ii) the use of an original training pipeline that\nfurther improves the quality of the generated texts.\n  We also introduce a new dataset called E2E+, designed to highlight the\ncopying capabilities of character-based models, that is a modified version of\nthe well-known E2E dataset used in the E2E Challenge. We tested our model\naccording to five broadly accepted metrics (including the widely used BLEU),\nshowing that it yields competitive performance with respect to both\ncharacter-based and word-based approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 13:33:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 11:38:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2019 15:35:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 12:48:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

A fast quantitative analysis of\nsuch huge data volumes can be done by comparing the observations to an archive\nof pre-calculated synthetic spectra to infer the thermodynamic properties of\nthe atmosphere. To analyze intensity spectra of the Ca II IR line at 854 nm in\nthe solar atmosphere, we generated an archive with 2,000,000 spectra under the\nassumption of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) with the NICOLE code\n(Socas-Navarro et al, 2015).

First, we provide an analog quantum algorithm that given a Markov\nchain, allows us to sample from its stationary distribution in a time that\nscales as the sum of the square root of the classical mixing time and the\nsquare root of the classical hitting time.

The proposed\ninformation processing architecture is used to support a perceptual\nattention-based predictive control algorithm that leverages model predictive\ncontrol (MPC), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and uncertainty\nquantification methods. The novelty of our approach lies in using MPC to learn\nhow to place attention on relevant areas of the visual input, which ultimately\nallows the system to more rapidly detect unsafe conditions. We accomplish this\nby using MPC to learn to select regions of interest in the input image, which\nare used to output control actions as well as estimates of epistemic and\naleatoric uncertainty in the attention-aware visual input. We use these\nuncertainty estimates to quantify the safety of our network controller under\nthe current navigation condition. The proposed architecture and algorithm is\ntested on a 1:5 scale terrestrial vehicle. Experimental results show that the\nproposed algorithm outperforms previous approaches on early detection of unsafe\nconditions, such as when novel obstacles are present in the navigation\nenvironment.

The MNO offers two quality-of-service (QoS) classes (high\nand low), differentiating the price based on the QoS class. The key question\nthat we address is whether and to which extent the MNO has incentive to adopt\nthis form of QoS-aware pricing. The first step is to model the parameters that\nare controlled by each PMSE user: i) the way to choose between the two QoS\nclasses and ii) the available budget per QoS class. The second step is to\ncompute the maximum revenue of the MNO. Our analysis reveals that the MNO can\nalways tune the prices so as to maximise its revenue for the scenario where all\nusers belong to the high QoS class. This is a consistent result throughout our\nstudy, that holds for any considered set of user-controlled parameters and of\ntechnical parameters. We conclude that the adoption of QoS-aware pricing in the\nLSA market generates a tussle between the MNO and the regulator. The MNO has\nincentive to support fewer users but with high QoS and charge them more, which\nis not aligned with the regulator's goal for social welfare maximisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 15:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-29"}

Applying psychological models of categorization to natural images\nrequired two significant advances.

To capture the prototypes developed through the early stages of a\nproject, a new research tool has been developed for capturing prototypes\nthrough multi-view images, along with metadata describing by whom, why, when\nand where the prototypes were captured. Over the course of 17 months, this\nresearch tool has been used to capture more than 800 physical prototypes from\n76 individual users across many projects. In this article, one project is shown\nin detail to demonstrate how this capturing system can gather empirical data\nfor enriching engineering design project cases that focus on prototyping for\nconcept generation.
