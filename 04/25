Such lack of global hyperbolicity is a well-known property of the\nanti-de Sitter solution and led many authors to question how is it possible to\ndevelop a quantum field theory on this spacetime. Wald and Ishibashi took a\nstep towards the healing of that causal issue when considering the propagation\nof scalar fields on AdS. They proposed a systematic procedure to obtain a\nphysically consistent dynamical evolution. Their prescription relies on\ndetermining the self-adjoint extensions of the spatial component of the\ndifferential wave operator. Such a requirement leads to the imposition of a\nspecific set of boundary conditions at infinity. We employ their scheme in the\nparticular case of the four-dimensional AdS spacetime and compute the\nexpectation values of the field squared and the energy-momentum tensor, which\nwill then bear the effects of those boundary conditions.

Thus, we formulate a physical setup in which\none of those modes satisfy a Robin boundary condition, while all others satisfy\nthe Dirichlet condition.

Their result, the reduction\nformula, is fundamental to practical calculations of scattering processes. A\nknown problem is that the operators that they use to create asymptotic states\ncreate much else besides the intended particles for a scattering process. In\nthe infinite-time limits appropriate to scattering, the extra contributions\nonly disappear in matrix elements with normalizable states, rather than in the\ncreated states themselves, i.e., the infinite-time limits of the LSZ creation\noperators are weak limits. The extra particles that are created are in a\ndifferent region of space-time than the intended scattering process. To be able\nto work with particle creation at non-asymptotic times, e.g., to give a\ntransparent and fully deductive treatment for scattering with long-lived\nunstable particles, it is necessary to have operators for which the\ninfinite-time limits are strong limits.

In\nfact, artificial intelligence algorithms are, in some cases, able to overcome\nhuman professionals. Usually, neural networks have more than a couple of hidden\nlayers, and thus, they involve a large quantity of parameters that need to be\noptimized. Commonly, numeric approaches are used to optimize the inner\nparameters of neural networks, such as the stochastic gradient descent.\nHowever, these techniques tend to be computationally very expensive, and for\nsome tasks, where effectiveness is crucial, high computational costs are not\nacceptable. Along these research lines, in this paper we propose to optimize\nthe parameters of neural networks by means of estimation of distribution\nalgorithms. More precisely, the univariate marginal distribution algorithm is\nused for evolving neural networks in various reinforcement learning tasks. For\nthe sake of validating our idea, we run the proposed algorithm on four OpenAI\nGym benchmark problems. In addition, the obtained results were compared with a\nstandard genetic algorithm. Revealing, that optimizing with UMDAc provides\nbetter results than the genetic algorithm in most of the cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 17:12:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-25"}

The skeletonized representation of the\nseismic traces consists of the low-rank latent-space variables predicted by a\nwell-trained autoencoder neural network. The input to the autoencoder is the\nrecorded common shot gathers, and the implicit function theorem is used to\ndetermine the perturbation of the skeletonized data with respect to the\nvelocity perturbation. The final velocity model is the one that best predicts\nthe observed latent-space parameters. Empirical results suggest that the\ncycle-skipping problem is largely mitigated compared to the conventional full\nwaveform inversion (FWI) method by replacing the waveform differences by those\nof the latent-space parameters. The advantage of this method over other\nskeletonized data methods is that no manual picking of important features is\nrequired because the skeletal data are automatically selected by the\nautoencoder. The most significant contribution of this paper is that it\nprovides a general framework for using solutions to the governing PDE to invert\nskeletal data generated by any type of a neural network. The governing equation\ncan be that for gravity, seismic waves, electromagnetic fields, and magnetic\nfields. The input data can be the records from different types of data and\ntheir skeletal features, as long as the model parameters are sensitive to their\nperturbations. The skeletal data can be the latent space variables of an\nautoencoder, a variational autoencoder, or a feature map from a convolutional\nneural network (CNN), or principal component analysis (PCA) features. In other\nwords, we have combined the best features of Newtonian physics and the pattern\nmatching capabilities of machine learning to invert seismic data by Newtonian\nmachine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 17:21:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-25"}

The introduction of the\nKL-divergence weight $\\beta$ can help steer the model clear of posterior\ncollapse, but its tuning is often a trial-and-error process with no guiding\nmetrics. Here we test the idea of using the total VAE loss of generated samples\n(generated loss) as the proxy metric for generation quality, the related\nhypothesis that VAE reconstruction from the mean latent vector tends to be a\nmore typical example of its class than the original, and the idea of exploiting\nthis property by augmenting training data with generated variants (augmented\ntraining). The results are mixed, but repeated encoding and decoding indeed\nresult in qualitatively and quantitatively more typical examples from both\nconvolutional and fully-connected MNIST VAEs, suggesting that it may be an\ninherent property of the VAE framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 17:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-25"}

To convert the time delay into distances, it is\nwell known that the gravitational potential of the main deflector and the\ncontribution of the matter along the line-of-sight need to be known to a\nsufficient level of precision. In this paper, we discuss a new astrometric\nrequirement that is becoming important as time-delay cosmography improves in\nprecision and accuracy with larger samples, and better data and modelling\ntechniques. We derive an analytic expression for the propagation of astrometric\nuncertainties on the multiple image positions into the inference of the Hubble\nconstant and derive requirements depending on image separation and relative\ntime delay. We note that this requirement applies equally to the image position\nmeasurements and to the accuracy of the model in reproducing them. To\nillustrate the requirement, we discuss some example lensing configurations and\nhighlight that, especially for time delays of order 10 days or shorter, the\nrelative astrometric requirement is of order milli-arcseconds, setting a tight\nrequirement on both measurements and models.

For passively-evolving galaxies with old stellar populations, hot\npost-Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars are the only viable extended source of\nionizing photons. In this work, we present the first prediction of LIER-like\nemission from post-AGB stars that is based on fully self-consistent stellar\nevolution and photoionization models.

Because the primary CMB temperature has been measured at the cosmic\nvariance limit, determining if these anomalies are hints of new physics as\nopposed to foregrounds, systematics, or simply statistical flukes, requires new\nobservables. In this paper, we highlight the potential contribution that future\nmeasurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (kSZ) and the polarized\nSunyaev Zel'dovich effect (pSZ) could make in determining the physical nature\nof several CMB anomalies. The kSZ and pSZ effects, temperature and polarization\nanisotropies induced by scattering from free electrons in the reionized\nUniverse, are the dominant blackbody contribution to the CMB on small angular\nscales. Using the technique of SZ tomography, measurements of kSZ and pSZ\neffects can be combined with galaxy surveys to reconstruct the remote CMB\ndipole and quadrupole fields, providing a 3-dimensional probe of large scale\nmodes inside our Hubble volume. Building on previous work, we forecast the\nadditional constraining power that these observables might offer for a\nrepresentative set of anomaly models. We find that the remote CMB dipole and\nquadrupole contain a similar amount of information on anomaly models as the\nprimary CMB polarization. The information from CMB temperature, polarization,\nand the remote dipole and quadrupole fields is complementary, and the full set\nof observables can improve constraints on anomaly models by a factor of $\\sim\n2-4$ using next-generation CMB experiments and galaxy surveys.

In this paper we first review\nsome strong adversarial attacks that may affect both audio signals and their 2D\nrepresentations and evaluate the resiliency of the most common machine learning\nmodel, namely deep learning models and support vector machines (SVM) trained on\n2D audio representations such as short time Fourier transform (STFT), discrete\nwavelet transform (DWT) and cross recurrent plot (CRP) against several\nstate-of-the-art adversarial attacks. Next, we propose a novel approach based\non pre-processed DWT representation of audio signals and SVM to secure audio\nsystems against adversarial attacks. The proposed architecture has several\npreprocessing modules for generating and enhancing spectrograms including\ndimension reduction and smoothing. We extract features from small patches of\nthe spectrograms using speeded up robust feature (SURF) algorithm which are\nfurther used to generate a codebook using the K-Means++ algorithm. Finally,\ncodewords are used to train a SVM on the codebook of the SURF-generated\nvectors. All these steps yield to a novel approach for audio classification\nthat provides a good trade-off between accuracy and resilience.

A detection of\nthe latter would have implications for the nature of the neutrino and give\naccess to the absolute neutrino mass. Here we report on the first direct\nobservation of $2\\nu$ECEC in $^{124}$Xe with the XENON1T Dark Matter detector.\nThe significance of the signal is $4.4\\sigma$ and the corresponding half-life\n$T_{1/2}^{2\\nu\\text{ECEC}} = (1.8\\pm 0.5_\\text{stat}\\pm 0.1_\\text{sys})\\times\n10^{22}\\;\\text{y}$ is the longest ever measured directly. This study\ndemonstrates that the low background and large target mass of xenon-based Dark\nMatter detectors make them well suited to measuring other rare processes as\nwell, and it highlights the broad physics reach for even larger next-generation\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 18:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-26"}

There\nare also vertical edges connecting two nearest neighbor vertices on distinct\nlayers $\\langle(x, i), (x, i+1)\\rangle$ for $x, i \\in\\mathbb{Z}$. On this graph\nwe consider the following anisotropic independent percolation model: horizontal\nedges are open with probability $1/(2N)$, while vertical edges are open with\nprobability $\\epsilon$ to be suitably tuned as $N$ grows to infinity.

The\nquestion is motivated by a result on the analogous layered ferromagnetic Ising\nmodel at mean field critical temperature [J. Stat. Phys.

However, calculating capacities directly is known to be\nintractable in general. Much recent work has focused on upper bounding certain\ncapacities in terms of more tractable quantities such as specific norms from\noperator theory. In the meantime, there has also been substantial recent\nprogress on estimating decoherence times with techniques from analysis and\ngeometry, even though many hard questions remain open. In this article, we\nintroduce a class of continuous-time quantum channels that we called\ntransferred channels, which are built through representation theory from a\nclassical Markov kernel defined on a compact group. We study two subclasses of\nsuch kernels: H\\\"ormander systems on compact Lie-groups and Markov chains on\nfinite groups. Examples of transferred channels include the depolarizing\nchannel, the dephasing channel, and collective decoherence channels acting on\n$d$ qubits. Some of the estimates presented are new, such as those for channels\nthat randomly swap subsystems. We then extend tools developed in earlier work\nby Gao, Junge and LaRacuente to transfer estimates of the classical Markov\nkernel to the transferred channels and study in this way different\nnon-commutative functional inequalities. The main contribution of this article\nis the application of this transference principle to the estimation of various\ncapacities as well as estimation of entanglement breaking times, defined as the\nfirst time for which the channel becomes entanglement breaking. Moreover, our\nestimates hold for non-ergodic channels such as the collective decoherence\nchannels, an important scenario that has been overlooked so far because of a\nlack of techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 20:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 08:24:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

The challenge only increases when organizations turn to third parties\nto provide technology and business services, which typically require tight\nnetwork integration and sharing of confidential data, potentially increasing\nthe organization's attack surface. The security maturity of an organization\ndescribes how well it mitigates known risks and responds to new threats. Today,\nmaturity is typically assessed with audits and questionnaires, which are\ndifficult to quantify, lack objectivity, and may not reflect current threats.\n  This paper demonstrates how external measurement of an organization can be\nused to assess the relative quality of security among organizations. Using a\nlarge dataset from BitSight(www.bitsight.com), a cybersecurity ratings company,\ncontaining 3.2 billion measurements spanning nearly 37,000 organizations\ncollected during calendar year 2015, we show how per-organizational \"risk\nvectors\" can be constructed that may be related to an organization's overall\nsecurity posture, or maturity. Using statistical analysis, we then study the\ncorrelation between the risk vectors and botnet infections. For example, we\nfind that misconfigured TLS services, publicly available unsecured protocols,\nand the use of peer-to-peer file sharing correlate with organizations that have\nincreased rates of botnet infections. We argue that the methodology used to\nidentify these correlations can easily be applied to other data to provide a\ngrowing picture of organizational security using external measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 20:18:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 16:59:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 May 2019 13:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-23"}

In the present work, we propose a multiscale\nmodel which explains the response of non-equilibrium wall-bounded turbulence\nunder the imposition of three-dimensional strain. The analysis is performed via\ndirect numerical simulation of transient three-dimensional turbulent channels\nsubjected to a sudden lateral pressure gradient at friction Reynolds numbers up\nto 1,000.

The CVS\neffects on the capacitance-voltage curve-shift, the time-dependent leakage\ncurrent, and the time-dependent dielectric breakdown were measured and\nanalyzed. CVS is observed to induce charge in Parylene-C and its interfaces\nwith gold and Pentacene. The net induced charge is positive and negative for,\nrespectively, negative and positive gate bias polarity during CVS. The\nmagnitude of the charge accumulated following positive gate CVS is\nsignificantly higher than that following negative gate bias CVS in the range of\n4 to 25 nC cm$^{-2}$. In contrast, the leakage current during the negative gate\nstress is three orders of magnitude higher than that during the positive gate\nstress for the same bias stress magnitude. The charge buildup and leakage\ncurrent are due to the trapping of electrons and holes near the\nParylene-C/Pentacene interface as well as in the Parylene-C layer. Before the\napplication of the CVS, a dielectric breakdown occurs at an electric field of\n1.62 MV cm$^{-1}$. After the application of the CVS, the breakdown voltage\ndecreases and the density of the trapped charges increases as the stress\nvoltage increases in magnitude, with the polarity of the trapped charges\nopposite to that of the stress voltage.

Thus, it is expected that the\nsuperconducting state is closely related to the intrinsic ferroelectric\ninstability. Indeed, recent experiments suggest existence of a coexistent phase\nof superconductivity and ferroelectricity in Ca-substituted SrTiO$_3$. In this\npaper, we propose that SrTiO$_3$ can be a platform of the ferroelectric\nsuperconductivity, which is characterized by a ferroelectric transition in the\nsuperconducting state. By analyzing a multiorbital model for $t_{2g}$\nelectrons, we show that the ferroelectric superconductivity is stabilized\nthrough two different mechanisms which rely on the presence of the spin-orbit\ncoupling.

That is,\nwhat we know about the data greatly determines our expectations, and therefore,\nwhat results we would find interesting and/or surprising. Given new knowledge\nabout the data, our expectations will change. Hence, in order to avoid\nredundant results, knowledge discovery algorithms ideally should follow such an\niterative updating procedure.\n  With this in mind, we introduce a well-founded approach for succinctly\nsummarizing data with the most informative itemsets; using a probabilistic\nmaximum entropy model, we iteratively find the itemset that provides us the\nmost novel information--that is, for which the frequency in the data surprises\nus the most---and in turn we update our model accordingly. As we use the\nMaximum Entropy principle to obtain unbiased probabilistic models, and only\ninclude those itemsets that are most informative with regard to the current\nmodel, the summaries we construct are guaranteed to be both descriptive and\nnon-redundant.\n  The algorithm that we present, called MTV, can either discover the top-$k$\nmost informative itemsets, or we can employ either the Bayesian Information\nCriterion (BIC) or the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to\nautomatically identify the set of itemsets that together summarize the data\nwell. In other words, our method will `tell you what you need to know' about\nthe data. Importantly, it is a one-phase algorithm: rather than picking\nitemsets from a user-provided candidate set, itemsets and their supports are\nmined on-the-fly. To further its applicability, we provide an efficient method\nto compute the maximum entropy distribution using Quick Inclusion-Exclusion.\n  Experiments on our method, using synthetic, benchmark, and real data, show\nthat the discovered summaries are succinct, and correctly identify the key\npatterns in the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 02:59:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Apr 2019 01:16:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

In addition, the largely ignored expression class\ndistribution bias is also addressed by a learnable re-weighting parameter, so\nthat the training and testing domains can share similar class distribution.\nExtensive cross-database experiments on both lab-controlled datasets (CK+,\nJAFFE, MMI and Oulu-CASIA) and real-world databases (AffectNet, FER2013, RAF-DB\n2.0 and SFEW 2.0) demonstrate that our ECAN can yield competitive performances\nacross various facial expression transfer tasks and outperform the\nstate-of-theart methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 04:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

Multi-view learning is of the\nmethods to achieve such goals. Recent methods propose deep multi-view networks\nvia adaptation of generic Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which concatenate\nfeatures of individual views at intermediate network layers (i.e., fusion\nlayers). In this work, we study the problem of multi-view learning in such\nend-to-end networks. We take a regularization approach via multi-view learning\ncriteria, and propose a novel, effective, and efficient neuron-wise\ncorrelation-maximizing regularizer. We implement our proposed regularizers\ncollectively as a correlation-regularized network layer (CorrReg). CorrReg can\nbe applied to either fully-connected or convolutional fusion layers, simply by\nreplacing them with their CorrReg counterparts. By partitioning neurons of a\nhidden layer in generic DNNs into multiple subsets, we also consider a\nmulti-view feature learning perspective of generic DNNs. Such a perspective\nenables us to study deep multi-view learning in the context of regularized\nnetwork training, for which we present control experiments of benchmark image\nclassification to show the efficacy of our proposed CorrReg. To investigate how\nCorrReg is useful for practical multi-view learning problems, we conduct\nexperiments of RGB-D object/scene recognition and multi-view based 3D object\nrecognition, using networks with fusion layers that concatenate intermediate\nfeatures of individual modalities or views for subsequent classification.\nApplying CorrReg to fusion layers of these networks consistently improves\nclassification performance. In particular, we achieve the new state of the art\non the benchmark RGB-D object and RGB-D scene datasets.

A detailed systematic\ninvestigation is made for a representative set of atoms and molecules, through\na number of properties like total ground-state electronic energies, permanent\ndipole moment ($\\bm{\\mu}$), static average dipole polarizability\n($\\overline{\\alpha}$). This is further extended to first-hyperpolarizability\n($\\bm{\\beta}$) in molecules. It employs a recently developed non-uniform\ngrid-optimization technique, with a suitably chosen fixed initial applied\nfield. A simple variant of the finite-field method, using a rational function\nfit to the dipole moment with respect to electric field, is adopted. We make\nuse of Labello-Ferreira-Kurtz (LFK) basis set, which has performed quite well\nin these scenarios. To assess the efficacy and feasibility, four XC functionals\nsuch as LDA, BLYP, PBE and LBVWN are chosen. Present results are compared with\navailable literature (both theoretical and experimental) values, whenever\npossible. In all instances, they show excellent agreement with the respective\natom-centered-grid results, very widely used in many quantum chemistry\nprograms. This demonstrates a viable alternative towards accurate prediction of\nresponse properties of many-electron systems in Cartesian coordinate grid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 06:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-26"}

To fill the gap, we propose a\nmethod to make abstract interpretation sound under speculative execution. There\nare two contributions. First, we introduce the notion of virtual control flow\nto augment instructions that may be speculatively executed and thus affect\nsubsequent instructions. Second, to make the analysis efficient, we propose\noptimizations to handle merges and loops and to safely bound the speculative\nexecution depth. We have implemented and evaluated the proposed method in a\nstatic cache analysis for execution time estimation and side channel detection.\nOur experiments show that the new method, while guaranteed to be sound under\nspeculative execution, outperforms state-of-the-art abstract interpretation\ntechniques that may be unsound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 06:40:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 03:49:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-16"}

A\nnew code for the solution of two dimensional dissipative magnetohydrodynamics\n(MHD) equations in cartesian geometry specifically developed to this end is\nthus presented. A current-vorticity formulation representative of an\nincompressible model is chosen in order to follow the formation of the current\nsheets and the ensuing magnetic reconnection process. A finite element\ndiscretization using triangles with quadratic basis functions on an\nunstructured grid is employed, and implemented via a highly adaptive\ncharacteristic- Galerkin scheme. The adaptivity of the code is illustrated on\nsimplified test equations and finally for magnetic reconnection associated to\nthe non linear development of the tilt instability between two repelling\ncurrent channels. Varying the Lundquist number S, has allowed to study the\ntransition between the steady-state Sweet-Parker reconnection regime (for S <\n10^4) and plasmoids dominated reconnection one (for S > 10^5).

The main purpose of this\narticle is to construct efficient suboptimal strategies for both players that\ncan be used to solve the above-mentioned infinite-horizon repeated game with\nasymmetric and incomplete information. It has been shown in game-theoretic\nliterature that security strategies provide optimal solution in zero-sum games.\nIt is also shown that both players' security strategies in an infinite-horizon\nasymmetric game depend only on the history of the informed player's actions.\nHowever, fixed-sized sufficient statistics are needed for both players to solve\nthe above-mentioned game efficiently.

To address the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel\nhashing approach, dubbed as \\emph{Discrete Semantic Transfer Hashing} (DSTH).\nThe key idea is to \\emph{directly} augment the semantics of discrete image hash\ncodes by exploring auxiliary contextual modalities. To this end, a unified\nhashing framework is formulated to simultaneously preserve visual similarities\nof images and perform semantic transfer from contextual modalities. Further, to\nguarantee direct semantic transfer and avoid information loss, we explicitly\nimpose the discrete constraint, bit--uncorrelation constraint and bit-balance\nconstraint on hash codes. A novel and effective discrete optimization method\nbased on augmented Lagrangian multiplier is developed to iteratively solve the\noptimization problem.

Conventional solutions first simply combine multiple\npre-constructed view-specific similarity structures into a collaborative\nsimilarity structure, and then perform the subsequent feature selection.

Further, the simple\nundirected view combination may adversely reduce the reliability of the\nultimate similarity structure for feature selection, as the view-specific\nsimilarity structures generally involve noises and outlying entries. To\nalleviate these problems, we propose an adaptive collaborative similarity\nlearning (ACSL) for multi-view feature selection. We propose to dynamically\nlearn the collaborative similarity structure, and further integrate it with the\nultimate feature selection into a unified framework. Moreover, a reasonable\nrank constraint is devised to adaptively learn an ideal collaborative\nsimilarity structure with proper similarity combination weights and desirable\nneighbor assignment, both of which could positively facilitate the feature\nselection.

This algorithm is the first practical solution to the problem. It is\nable to compute small hexahedral meshes of quadrangulations for which the\npreviously known best solutions could only be built by hand or contained\nthousands of hexahedra. These challenging quadrangulations include the\nboundaries of transition templates that are critical for the success of general\nhexahedral meshing algorithms.\n  The algorithm proposed in this paper is dedicated to building combinatorial\nhexahedral meshes of small quadrangulations and ignores the geometrical\nproblem. The key idea of the method is to exploit the equivalence between quad\nflips in the boundary and the insertion of hexahedra glued to this boundary.\nThe tree of all sequences of flipping operations is explored, searching for a\npath that transforms the input quadrangulation Q into a new quadrangulation for\nwhich a hexahedral mesh is known. When a small hexahedral mesh exists, a\nsequence transforming Q into the boundary of a cube is found; otherwise, a set\nof pre-computed hexahedral meshes is used.\n  A novel approach to deal with the large number of problem symmetries is\nproposed. Combined with an efficient backtracking search, it allows small\nshellable hexahedral meshes to be found for all even quadrangulations with up\nto 20 quadrangles. All 54,943 such quadrangulations were meshed using no more\nthan 72 hexahedra. This algorithm is also used to find a construction to fill\narbitrary domains, thereby proving that any ball-shaped domain bounded by n\nquadrangles can be meshed with no more than 78 n hexahedra. This very\nsignificantly lowers the previous upper bound of 5396 n.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 09:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-18"}

To address this issue, recent progress in cross-domain\nrecognition has featured the Mean Teacher, which directly simulates\nunsupervised domain adaptation as semi-supervised learning. The domain gap is\nthus naturally bridged with consistency regularization in a teacher-student\nscheme. In this work, we advance this Mean Teacher paradigm to be applicable\nfor cross-domain detection.

In addition, we\nalso assume that the coordinate along the string's axis is compactified to a\ncircle and presents an extra magnetic flux running along its center. This\ncompactification is implemented by imposing a quasiperiodic condition on the\nfield with an arbitrary phase $\\beta$. The calculation of the VEV of the EMT\nand field squared, are developed by using the positive-energy Wightman\nfunction. The latter is constructed by the mode sum of the complete set of\nnormalized bosonic wave-functions. Due to the compactification, two distinct\ncontributions take place. The first one corresponds to the VEV in a cosmic\nstring spacetime without compactification considering the magnetic interaction.\nSo, this term presents a contribution due to the non-trivial topology of the\nconical space, and an additional contribution due to the interaction between\nthe scalar field with the magnetic flux. The latter is a periodic function of\nthe magnetic flux with period equal to the quantum flux, $\\Phi_0=2\\pi/e$, and\ncorresponds to a Aharanov-Bhom type contribution. The second contribution is\ninduced by the compactification itself and depends on the magnetic flux along\nthe string's core.

Most of it\nwork in three separate steps: similarity graph construction, clustering label\nrelaxing and label discretization with k-means. Such common practice has three\ndisadvantages: 1) the predefined similarity graph is often fixed and may not be\noptimal for the subsequent clustering. 2) the relaxing process of cluster\nlabels may cause significant information loss. 3) label discretization may\ndeviate from the real clustering result since k-means is sensitive to the\ninitialization of cluster centroids. To tackle these problems, in this paper,\nwe propose an effective discrete optimal graph clustering (DOGC) framework. A\nstructured similarity graph that is theoretically optimal for clustering\nperformance is adaptively learned with a guidance of reasonable rank\nconstraint. Besides, to avoid the information loss, we explicitly enforce a\ndiscrete transformation on the intermediate continuous label, which derives a\ntractable optimization problem with discrete solution. Further, to compensate\nthe unreliability of the learned labels and enhance the clustering accuracy, we\ndesign an adaptive robust module that learns prediction function for the unseen\ndata based on the learned discrete cluster labels. Finally, an iterative\noptimization strategy guaranteed with convergence is developed to directly\nsolve the clustering results.

Therefore, formal methods for these kinds\nof systems are greatly required. In this paper, we use a formal language that\nperforms deductive verification on an Ethereum Blockchain application based on\nsmart contracts, which are self-executing digital contracts. Blockchain systems\nmanipulate cryptocurrency and transaction information. Therefore , if a bug\noccurs in the blockchain, serious consequences such as a loss of money can\nhappen.

We first write a Why3 smart contracts program; next\nwe formulate specifications to be proved as absence of RunTime Error properties\nand functional properties, then we verify the behavior of the program using the\nWhy3 system. Finally we compile the Why3 contracts to the Ethereum Virtual\nMachine (EVM). Moreover, we give a set of generic mathematical statements that\nallows verifying functional properties suited to any type of smart contracts\nholding cryptocurrency, showing that Why3 can be a suitable language to write\nsmart contracts.

First,\nthe isovector dipole strength and excitation energies are investigated for the\nNi isotopic chain at zero temperature.

Widely-used neuroimage analysis\npipelines rely heavily on these techniques, which are often computationally\nexpensive. In contrast, there has been a recent surge of approaches that\nleverage deep learning to implement segmentation tools that are computationally\nefficient at test time. However, most of these strategies rely on learning from\nmanually annotated images. These supervised deep learning methods are therefore\nsensitive to the intensity profiles in the training dataset. To develop a deep\nlearning-based segmentation model for a new image dataset (e.g., of different\ncontrast), one usually needs to create a new labeled training dataset, which\ncan be prohibitively expensive, or rely on suboptimal ad hoc adaptation or\naugmentation approaches. In this paper, we propose an alternative strategy that\ncombines a conventional probabilistic atlas-based segmentation with deep\nlearning, enabling one to train a segmentation model for new MRI scans without\nthe need for any manually segmented images.

For the two stars\nto merge when both are in their giant phases the stars must have close masses\nat their zero age main sequence, and the orbital separation must be in the\nright range. After the two giants merge, the two cores spiral-in toward each\nother within a common envelope. We study the energy sources of radiation in\nthis process that include the ejection of mass that powers radiation by both\nrecombination and by collision with previously ejected mass. This process\nincludes no jets, unlike many other types of ILOTs, hence the event will not\nform a bipolar nebula. Using the stellar evolution numerical code mesa for two\nbinary systems with stellar masses of (15Mo, 15.75Mo) and (31Mo, 31.5Mo), we\nfind that the merger of the two cores releases gravitational energy that\nmarginally ejects the entire common envelope.

With recent data on\ngrain heating frequencies as an input for a modified rate-equation\nastrochemical model, this study examines, which whole-grain heating temperature\nregime is the most efficient at altering the chemical composition of gas and\nices. Such a question arises because low-temperature heating, albeit less\neffective at inducing evaporation of adsorbed species, happens much more often\nthan high-temperature grain heating. The model considers a delayed\ngravitational collapse of a Bonnor-Ebert sphere, followed by a quiescent cloud\ncore stage. It was found that the whole-grain heating regimes can be divided in\nthree classes, depending on their induced physico-chemical effects. Heating to\nlow-temperature thresholds of 27 and 30 K induce desorption of the most\nvolatile of species - N2 and O2 ices, and adsorbed atoms. The\nmedium-temperature thresholds 40, 50, and 60 K allow effective evaporation of\nCO and CH4, delaying their accumulation in ices. We find that the 40 K\nthreshold is the most effective cosmic-ray induced whole-grain heating regime\nbecause its induced evaporation of CO promotes major abundance changes also for\nother compounds. An important role in grain cooling may be played by molecular\nnitrogen as the most volatile of the abundant species in the icy mantles.\nWhole-grain heating determines the sequence of accretion for different\nmolecules on to grain surface, which plays a key role in the synthesis of\ncomplex organic molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 14:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-26"}

We validate our Ansatz in the case of the XX and Heisenberg chain,\nand further apply it to the case of a simple, yet paradigmatic model of\nfrustration, namely the $J_1-J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain. For this\nmodel we provide clear evidence that our trial wave function faithfully\ndescribes both the short-range physics (particularly in terms of ground state\nenergy) and the long-range one expressed by the Luttinger exponent, and the\ncentral charge of the related conformal field theory, which govern the decay of\ncorrelations and the scaling of the entanglement entropy, respectively. Finally\nwe successfully reproduce the incommensurate correlations developing in the\nsystem at strong frustration, as a result of the flexible representation of\nsign (phase) structures via complex weights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 15:26:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2019 14:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

However, unlike SORA that utilizes shift-vector\nto shift the design variables within a constraint (independently), in TSM we\npropose to shift the threshold of the constraints.

The\ntraffic characteristic analysis in maintenance work zones is a basis for\nmaintenance work zone related research such as layout design, traffic control\nand safety assessment. Due to the difficulty in vehicle microscopic behaviour\ndata acquisition, traditional traffic characteristic analysis mainly focuses on\nmacroscopic characteristics. With the development of data acquisition\ntechnology, it becomes much easier to obtain a large amount of microscopic\nbehaviour data nowadays, which lays a good foundation for analysing the traffic\ncharacteristics from a new point of view. This paper puts forward a method for\nexpressing and displaying the vehicle behaviour distribution in maintenance\nwork zones. Using portable vehicle microscopic behaviour data acquisition\ndevices, lots of data can be obtained. Based on this data, an endpoint\ndetection technology is used to automatically extract the segments in behaviour\ndata with violent fluctuations, which are segments where vehicles take\nbehaviours such as acceleration or turning. Using the support vector machine\nclassification method, the specific types of behaviours of the segments\nextracted can be identified, and together with a data combination method, a\ntotal of ten types of behaviours can be identified. Then the kernel density\nanalysis is used to cluster different types of behaviours of all passing\nvehicles to show the distribution on maps. By this method, how vehicles travel\nthrough maintenance work zones, and how different vehicle behaviours distribute\nin maintenance work zones can be displayed intuitively on maps, which is a\nnovel traffic characteristic and can shed light to maintenance work zone\nrelated researches such as safety assessment and design method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 10:41:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-29"}

In most state-of-the-art\nhashing-based image retrieval systems, for each image, local descriptors are\nfirst aggregated as a global representation vector. This global vector is then\nsubjected to a hashing function to generate a binary hash code. In previous\nworks, the aggregating and the hashing processes are designed independently.\nHence these frameworks may generate suboptimal hash codes. In this paper, we\nfirst propose a novel unsupervised hashing framework in which feature\naggregating and hashing are designed simultaneously and optimized jointly.\nSpecifically, our joint optimization generates aggregated representations that\ncan be better reconstructed by some binary codes. This leads to more\ndiscriminative binary hash codes and improved retrieval accuracy. In addition,\nthe proposed method is flexible. It can be extended for supervised hashing.\nWhen the data label is available, the framework can be adapted to learn binary\ncodes which minimize the reconstruction loss w.r.t. label vectors.

We\ndemonstrate empirically that our approach out-performs state-of-the-art\napproaches in the task of EEG classification, and the results of visualization\nindicate that our approach can detect brain functional areas related to a\ncertain task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 06:10:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-29"}

Clinicians need tools monitoring and prioritizing the literature\nto understand the clinical implications of the pathogenic genetic variants. We\ndeveloped and evaluated two machine learning models to classify abstracts as\nrelevant to the penetrance (risk of cancer for germline mutation carriers) or\nprevalence of germline genetic mutations. METHODS: We conducted literature\nsearches in PubMed and retrieved paper titles and abstracts to create an\nannotated dataset for training and evaluating the two machine learning\nclassification models. Our first model is a support vector machine (SVM) which\nlearns a linear decision rule based on the bag-of-ngrams representation of each\ntitle and abstract. Our second model is a convolutional neural network (CNN)\nwhich learns a complex nonlinear decision rule based on the raw title and\nabstract. We evaluated the performance of the two models on the classification\nof papers as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. RESULTS: For penetrance\nclassification, we annotated 3740 paper titles and abstracts and used 60% for\ntraining the model, 20% for tuning the model, and 20% for evaluating the model.\nThe SVM model achieves 89.53% accuracy (percentage of papers that were\ncorrectly classified) while the CNN model achieves 88.95 % accuracy. For\nprevalence classification, we annotated 3753 paper titles and abstracts. The\nSVM model achieves 89.14% accuracy while the CNN model achieves 89.13 %\naccuracy. CONCLUSION: Our models achieve high accuracy in classifying abstracts\nas relevant to penetrance or prevalence. By facilitating literature review,\nthis tool could help clinicians and researchers keep abreast of the burgeoning\nknowledge of gene-cancer associations and keep the knowledge bases for clinical\ndecision support tools up to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 17:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-30"}

To illustrate the point I introduce\na toy model of a detector. The form of the model follows common practice in\nquantum optics and cavity QED. Each detector atom can be resonantly excited by\nthe incoming particle, and then emit a detection signature (e.g. bright flash\nof light) or dissipate its energy thermally. Different atoms have slightly\ndifferent resonant energies per the isolated-levels assumption, and the\nprojectile preferentially excites the atom with the closest energy match. The\ntoy model permits one easily to estimate the probability that any atom is\nresonantly excited, and also that a detection signature is produced before\nbeing overtaken by thermal dissipation. The end-to-end detection probability is\nthe product of these two probabilities, and is proportional to the absolute\nsquare of the incoming wavefunction at the atom in question, i.e. the Born\nrule.

However, the intensive multiply-accumulate computations (MACs) executed\nat the crossbars during the inference phase are still the bottleneck for the\nfurther improvement of energy efficiency and throughput. In this work, we\nexplore several methods to reduce the computations for the RRAM-based CNN\naccelerators. First, the output sparsity resulting from the widely employed\nRectified Linear Unit is exploited, and a significant portion of computations\nare bypassed through an early detection of the negative output activations.\nSecond, an adaptive approximation is proposed to terminate the MAC early when\nthe sum of the partial results of the remaining computations is considered to\nbe within a certain range of the intermediate accumulated result and thus has\nan insignificant contribution to the inference. In order to determine these\nredundant computations, a novel runtime estimation on the maximum and minimum\nvalues of each output activation is developed and used during the MAC\noperation. Experimental results show that around 70% of the computations can be\nreduced during the inference with a negligible accuracy loss smaller than 0.2%.\nAs a result, the energy efficiency and the throughput are improved by over 2.9\nand 2.8 times, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art RRAM-based\naccelerators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 13:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}
