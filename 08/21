Most existing methods perform 3D human\npose estimation without explicitly considering the scene. We observe however\nthat the world constrains the body and vice-versa. To motivate this, we show\nthat current 3D human pose estimation methods produce results that are not\nconsistent with the 3D scene. Our key contribution is to exploit static 3D\nscene structure to better estimate human pose from monocular images. The method\nenforces Proximal Relationships with Object eXclusion and is called PROX. To\ntest this, we collect a new dataset composed of 12 different 3D scenes and RGB\nsequences of 20 subjects moving in and interacting with the scenes. We\nrepresent human pose using the 3D human body model SMPL-X and extend SMPLify-X\nto estimate body pose using scene constraints. We make use of the 3D scene\ninformation by formulating two main constraints. The inter-penetration\nconstraint penalizes intersection between the body model and the surrounding 3D\nscene. The contact constraint encourages specific parts of the body to be in\ncontact with scene surfaces if they are close enough in distance and\norientation. For quantitative evaluation we capture a separate dataset with 180\nRGB frames in which the ground-truth body pose is estimated using a motion\ncapture system. We show quantitatively that introducing scene constraints\nsignificantly reduces 3D joint error and vertex error.

This is\nespecially important for imaging requiring low-intensity fields up to the level\nof few-photons. However, quantum imaging generally leads to nonlinear\nestimation problems. The complexity of these problems rapidly increases with\nthe number of parameters describing the object. We suggest a way to drastically\nreduce the complexity for a wide class of problems.

This iterative scheme is linear on the total number of parameters.\nThis scheme is applied to quantum near-field imaging, the inference procedure\nis developed resulting in super-resolving reconstruction of grey compound\ntransmission objects. The functionality of the method is demonstrated with\nexperimental data obtained by measurements of higher-order correlation\nfunctions for imaging with entangled twin-photons and pseudo-thermal light\nsources. By analyzing the informational content of the measurement, it becomes\npossible to predict the existence of optimal photon correlations providing for\nthe best image resolution in the super-resolution regime.

The dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) is\nthe gold standard for measuring human circadian phase (i.e., timing). The\ncollection of DLMO is expensive and time-consuming since multiple saliva or\nblood samples are required overnight in special conditions, and the samples\nmust then be assayed for melatonin. Recently, several computational approaches\nhave been designed for estimating DLMO. These methods collect daily sampled\ndata (e.g., sleep onset/offset times) or frequently sampled data (e.g., light\nexposure/skin temperature/physical activity collected every minute) to train\nlearning models for estimating DLMO. One limitation of these studies is that\nthey only leverage one time-scale data. We propose a two-step framework for\nestimating DLMO using data from both time scales. The first step summarizes\ndata from before the current day, while the second step combines this summary\nwith frequently sampled data of the current day. We evaluate three moving\naverage models that input sleep timing data as the first step and use recurrent\nneural network models as the second step.

Current predictions\nspan a wide range of possibilities, while the recent EDGES observations\ndisagree with the standard models and call, if confirmed, for non-standard\nphysical processes and/or for an early population of extragalactic sources\nproducing a remarkable background at high redshifts almost consistent with the\nARCADE 2 claim of a significant excess of CMB absolute temperature at low\nfrequency.

The observer peculiar motion with\nrespect to a reference frame in rest with respect to the CMB produces boosting\neffects in various observable quantities, remarkable at low multipoles, and\nparticularly in the dipole, with frequency spectral behaviours depending on the\nmonopole emission spectrum. We present a novel investigation at radio\nfrequencies, aimed at predicting the imprints expected in the redshifted 21-cm\nline signal and in the diffuse free-free emission plus the Comptonization\ndistortion for several models.

By reconfigurable, it means that a model can\npreserve the intrinsic one-to-many mapping from a given layout to multiple\nplausible images with different styles, and is adaptive with respect to\nperturbations of a layout and style latent code.

Here we present the results from\nour self-consistent MOND $N$-body simulation of a close flyby of two galaxies\nsimilar to the Milky Way. It turns out that most types of the structures that\nare traditionally assigned to galaxy mergers can be formed by non-merging\nencounters, including tidal arms, bridges, streams, shells, disk warps, thick\ndisks, and most probably also disks of satellites. The success of MOND in\nexplaining the dynamics of galaxies hints us that this way of formation of\ntidal structures should be considered seriously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-22"}

To\nisolate the effects of small- and large-scale turbulent flow motion on the\nyoung flame kernel, a three-dimensional DNS database has been designed to be\nrepresentative for engine part load conditions. The analysis is focussed on\nflame displacement speed and flame area in order to investigate effects of\nflame structure and flame geometry on the global burning rate evolution. It is\nshown that despite a Karlovitz number of up to 13, which is at the upper range\nof conventional engine operation, thickening of the averaged flame structure by\nsmall-scale turbulent mixing is not observed. After ignition effects have\ndecayed, the flame normal displacement speed recovers the behavior of a laminar\nunstretched premixed flame under the considered unity-Lewis-number conditions.\nRun-to-run variations in the global heat release rate are shown to be primarily\ncaused by flame kernel area dynamics. The analysis of the flame area balance\nequation shows that turbulence causes stochastic flame kernel area growth by\naffecting the curvature evolution, rather than by inducing variations in total\nflame area production by strain. Further, it is shown that in local segments of\na fully-developed planar flame with similar surface area as the investigated\nflame kernels, temporal variations in flame area rate-of-change occur.\nContrasting to early flame kernels, these effects can be exclusively attributed\nto curvature variations in negatively curved flame regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 18:21:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Dec 2019 13:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

However,\ntheir robustness against adversarial attacks is criticized. Prior studies show\nthat using unnoticeable modifications on graph topology or nodal features can\nsignificantly reduce the performances of GNNs. It is very challenging to design\nrobust graph neural networks against poisoning attack and several efforts have\nbeen taken. Existing work aims at reducing the negative impact from adversarial\nedges only with the poisoned graph, which is sub-optimal since they fail to\ndiscriminate adversarial edges from normal ones. On the other hand, clean\ngraphs from similar domains as the target poisoned graph are usually available\nin the real world. By perturbing these clean graphs, we create supervised\nknowledge to train the ability to detect adversarial edges so that the\nrobustness of GNNs is elevated. However, such potential for clean graphs is\nneglected by existing work. To this end, we investigate a novel problem of\nimproving the robustness of GNNs against poisoning attacks by exploring clean\ngraphs. Specifically, we propose PA-GNN, which relies on a penalized\naggregation mechanism that directly restrict the negative impact of adversarial\nedges by assigning them lower attention coefficients. To optimize PA-GNN for a\npoisoned graph, we design a meta-optimization algorithm that trains PA-GNN to\npenalize perturbations using clean graphs and their adversarial counterparts,\nand transfers such ability to improve the robustness of PA-GNN on the poisoned\ngraph. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the\nrobustness of PA-GNN against poisoning attacks on graphs.

By composing multiple parallel chain instances, the\nwhole systems' throughput can approach the network capacity. How to coordinate\ndifferent chains' blocks and to construct them into a global ordering is\ncritical to the performance of parallel chain protocol. However, the existed\nsolutions use either the global synchronization clock with the single-chain\nbottleneck or pre-defined ordering sequences with distortion of blocks'\ncausality to order blocks. In addition, the prior ordering methods rely on that\nhonest participants faithfully follow the ordering protocol, but remain silent\nfor any denial of ordering (DoR) attack.\n  On the other hand, the conflicting transactions included into the global\nblock sequence will make Simple Payment Verification (SPV) difficult. Clients\nusually need to store a full record of transactions to distinguish the\nconflictions and tell whether transactions are confirmed. However, the\nrequirement for a full record will greatly hinder blockchains' application,\nespecially for mobile scenarios.\n  In this technical report, we propose Eunomia, which leverages logical clock\nand fine-grained UTXO sharding to realize a simple, efficient, secure and\npermissionless parallel chain protocol. By observing the characteristics of the\nparallel chain, we find the blocks ordering issue in parallel chain has many\nsimilarities with the event ordering in the distributed system. Eunomia thus\nadopts \"virtual\" logical clock, which is optimized to have the minimum protocol\noverhead and runs in a distributed way. In addition, Eunomia combines the\nmining incentive with block ordering, providing incentive compatibility against\nDoR attack. What's more, the fine-grained UTXO sharding does well solve the\nconflicting transactions in parallel chain and is shown to be SPV-friendly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 18:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-22"}

Yield\noptimization is a much more challenging task. On one side, optimizing the\ngenerally non-convex probability measure of performance metrics is difficult.\nOn the other side, evaluating the probability measure in each optimization\niteration requires massive simulation data, especially when the process\nvariations are non-Gaussian correlated. This paper proposes a data-efficient\nframework for the yield-aware optimization of photonic ICs. This framework\noptimizes the design performance with a yield guarantee, and it consists of two\nmodules: a modeling module that builds stochastic surrogate models for design\nobjectives and chance constraints with a few simulation samples, and a novel\nyield optimization module that handles probabilistic objectives and chance\nconstraints in an efficient deterministic way. This deterministic treatment\navoids repeatedly evaluating probability measures at each iteration, thus it\nonly requires a few simulations in the whole optimization flow. We validate the\naccuracy and efficiency of the whole framework by a synthetic example and two\nphotonic ICs.

Our analysis\nestablishes a new framework for deriving fast-rate PAC-Bayes bounds and yields\nnew insights on PAC-Bayesian theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 19:46:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2019 16:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

In particular, a dual-beam mmWave transmitter, comprised\nof two independent antenna arrays, attempts to reliably communicate to a\nreceiver Bob when hiding the existence of transmission from a warden Willie. In\nthis regard, operating over mmWave bands not only increases the covertness\nthanks to directional beams, but also increases the transmission data rates\ngiven much more available bandwidths and enables ultra-low form factor\ntransceivers due to the lower wavelengths used compared to the conventional\nradio frequency (RF) counterpart. We assume that the transmitter Alice employs\none of its antenna arrays to form a directive beam for transmission to Bob. The\nother antenna array is used by Alice to generate another beam toward Willie as\na jamming signal with its transmit power changing independently from a\ntransmission block to another block. We characterize Willie's detection\nperformance with the optimal detector and the closed-form of its expected value\nfrom Alice's perspective. We further derive the closed-form expression for the\noutage probability of the Alice-Bob link, which enables characterizing the\noptimal covert rate that can be achieved using the proposed setup.

We detail an exploratory study on the\neffects of a dynamical magnetic field on the hydrodynamic medium created in the\ncollisions of two ultrarelativistic heavy-ions, using the framework of\nnumerical ideal MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) with the ECHO-QGP code.

Next, we explore the impact of the chiral magnetic\nconductivity on electric charges produced at the edges of the fireball. This\ninitial $\\sigma_\\chi$ can be understood as a long-wavelength effective\ndescription of chiral fermion production.

In particular, precisely controlling the resonance frequency of\nisolated nanoelectromechanical resonators (NEMS) has enabled innovations such\nas tunable mechanical filtering and mixing as well as commercial technologies\nsuch as robust timing oscillators. Much like their electronic device\ncounterparts, the potential of NEMS grows when they are built up into\nlarge-scale arrays. Such arrays have enabled neutral-particle mass spectroscopy\nand have been proposed for ultralow-power alternatives to traditional analog\nelectronics as well as nanomechanical information technologies like memory,\nlogic, and computing. A fundamental challenge to these applications is to\nprecisely tune the vibrational frequency and coupling of all resonators in the\narray, since traditional tuning methods, like patterned electrostatic gating or\ndielectric tuning, become intractable when devices are densely packed. Here, we\ndemonstrate a persistent, rewritable, scalable, and high-speed frequency tuning\nmethod for graphene-based NEMS. Our method uses a focused laser and two shared\nelectrical contacts to photodope individual resonators by simultaneously\napplying optical and electrostatic fields. After the fields are removed, the\ntrapped charge created by this process persists and applies a local\nelectrostatic tension to the resonators, tuning their frequencies. By providing\na facile means to locally address the strain of a NEMS resonator, this approach\nlays the groundwork for fully programmable large-scale NEMS lattices and\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 21:15:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 2019 06:49:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

In the present paper, we address the\nsituation with several factors using a perturbation technique around the case\nwhere these factors are perfectly correlated reducing the problem to the case\nwith a single factor. Our proposed approximation requires to solve numerically\ntwo linear equations in lower dimension instead of a fully non-linear HJB\nequation. A rigorous accuracy result is derived by constructing sub- and super-\nsolutions so that their difference is at the desired order of accuracy. We\nillustrate our result with a particular model for which we have explicit\nformulas for the approximation. In order to keep the notations as explicit as\npossible, we treat the case with one stock and two factors and we describe an\nextension to the case with two stocks and two factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 22:00:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 21:25:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2022 23:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-29"}

The popular assumption about\nthe working of HVS is that it exploits a communal feature subspace exists\nbetween the registering images or fields-of-view that encompasses key\ndrift-invariant features. Mimicking the approach that is potentially adopted by\nthe HVS, herein, we present a representation learning technique of this\ninvariant communal subspace that is shared by registering domains. The proposed\ncommunal domain learning (CDL) framework uses a set of hierarchical nonlinear\ntransforms to learn the communal subspace that minimizes the probability\ndifferences and maximizes the amount of shared information between the\nregistering domains.

In\nparticular, we report the state-of-the-art performance of 81.3 mIoU on the\nCityscapes test set. For a 256x128 input, APNB is around 6 times faster than a\nnon-local block on GPU while 28 times smaller in GPU running memory occupation.\nCode is available at: https://github.com/MendelXu/ANN.git.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 02:26:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 14:59:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2019 03:10:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 13:35:01 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 13:31:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-30"}

Here, we built a database including both CXR\nimages with severe abnormalities and experts' lung segmentation results, and\naimed to evaluate our network's efficacy in lung segmentation from these\nimages. Materials and Methods: For lung segmentation, CXR images from the\nJapanese Society of Radiological Technology (JSRT, N = 247) and Montgomery\ndatabases (N = 138), were included, and 65 additional images depicting severe\nabnormalities from a public database were evaluated and annotated by a\nradiologist, thereby adding lung segmentation results to these images. Baseline\nU-net was used to segment the lungs in images from the three databases.\nSubsequently, the U-net network architecture was automatically optimized for\nlung segmentation from CXR images using Bayesian optimization.

Results: Our results\ndemonstrated that using baseline U-net yielded poorer lung segmentation results\nin our database than those in the JSRT and Montgomery databases, implying that\nrobust segmentation of lungs may be difficult because of severe abnormalities.\nThe DSC values with baseline U-net for the JSRT, Montgomery and our databases\nwere 0.979, 0.941, and 0.889, respectively, and with optimized U-net, 0.976,\n0.973, and 0.932, respectively.

However,\nmost previous approaches usually suffer from the following problems. Many\ndiscriminative models, especially end-to-end (E2E) models, are difficult to\nextract unknown values that are not in the candidate ontology; previous\ngenerative models, which can extract unknown values from utterances, degrade\nthe performance due to ignoring the semantic information of pre-defined\nontology. Besides, previous generative models usually need a hand-crafted list\nto normalize the generated values. How to integrate the semantic information of\npre-defined ontology and dialogue text (heterogeneous texts) to generate\nunknown values and improve performance becomes a severe challenge. In this\npaper, we propose a Copy-Enhanced Heterogeneous Information Learning model with\nmultiple encoder-decoder for DST (CEDST), which can effectively generate all\npossible values including unknown values by copying values from heterogeneous\ntexts. Meanwhile, CEDST can effectively decompose the large state space into\nseveral small state spaces through multi-encoder, and employ multi-decoder to\nmake full use of the reduced spaces to generate values. Multi-encoder-decoder\narchitecture can significantly improve performance. Experiments show that CEDST\ncan achieve state-of-the-art results on two datasets and our constructed\ndatasets with many unknown values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 04:05:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-22"}

The entire spin chirality of the crystal, unless\nmacroscopically canceled, causes the geometrical Hall effect of real-space\nBerry-phase origin, whereas the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in a\nconventional metallic ferromagnet is of the momentum-space Berry-phase origin\ninduced by relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC).

Neutrinos are\ndetected through the observation of Cherenkov light from charged relativistic\nparticles generated in neutrino interactions, using an array of 86~strings of\noptical sensor modules. Currently an upgrade to the IceCube detector is in\npreparation. This IceCube Upgrade will add seven additional strings with new\noptical sensors and calibration devices. A new camera system is designed for\nthis upgrade to be installed with the new optical modules. This camera system\nwill study bulk ice properties and the refrozen ice in the drill hole. The\nsystem can also be utilized to provide information on the detector geometry\nincluding location and orientation of the optical modules and cables that can\nbe used to calibrate IceCube Monte Carlo simulations. A better understanding of\nthe refrozen ice in the drill hole including the complementary knowledge of the\noptical properties of the surrounding glacial ice will be obtained by surveying\nand analyzing the images from this system. The camera system consists of two\ntypes of components: an image sensor module and an illumination module. The\nimage sensor module uses a CMOS image sensor to take pictures for the purpose\nof calibration studies. The illumination module emits static, monochromatic\nlight into a given direction with a specific beam width and brightness during\nthe image taking process. To evaluate the system design and demonstrate its\nfunctionality, a simulation study based on lab measurements is performed in\nparallel with the hardware development. This study allows for the development\nof the preliminary image analysis tool for the system. We present the prototype\nof the camera system and the results of the first system demonstrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 07:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-22"}

However, the same vector cannot accurately\ncapture a user's varying preferences on all items, especially when considering\nthe diverse characteristics of various items. To tackle this problem, in this\npaper, we propose a novel Multimodal Attentive Metric Learning (MAML) method to\nmodel user diverse preferences for various items. In particular, for each\nuser-item pair, we propose an attention neural network, which exploits the\nitem's multimodal features to estimate the user's special attention to\ndifferent aspects of this item. The obtained attention is then integrated into\na metric-based learning method to predict the user preference on this item. The\nadvantage of metric learning is that it can naturally overcome the problem of\ndot product similarity, which is adopted by matrix factorization (MF) based\nrecommendation models but does not satisfy the triangle inequality property. In\naddition, it is worth mentioning that the attention mechanism cannot only help\nmodel user's diverse preferences towards different items, but also overcome the\ngeometrically restrictive problem caused by collaborative metric learning.\nExtensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets show that our model\ncan substantially outperform the state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the\npotential of modeling user diverse preference for recommendation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 07:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-22"}

In this paper, we propose an\nanalytically solvable model to investigate the energy transfer between a\nbosonic bath and a fermionic chain which are nonlinearly-coupled to each other.\nThe bosonic bath consists of an infinite collection of non-interacting bosonic\nmodes, while the fermionic chain is represented by a chain of interacting\nfermions with nearest-neighbor interactions. We compare behaviors of the\ntemperature-dependent energy current $J_{T}$ and temperature-independent energy\ncurrent $J_{TI}$ for different bath configurations. With respect to the bath\nspectrum, $J_{T}$ decays exponentially for Lorentz-Drude type bath, which is\nthe same as the conventional approximations. On the other hand, the decay rate\nis $1/t^{3}$ for Ohmic type and $1/t$ for white noise, which doesn't have\nconventional counterparts. For the temperature-independent current $J_{TI}$,\nthe decay rate is divergent for the Lorentz-Drude type bath, $1/t^{4}$ for the\nOhmic bath, and $1/t$ for the white noise. When further considering the\ndynamics of the fermionic chain, the current will be modulated based on the\nenvelope from the bath. As an example, for a bosonic bath with Ohmic spectrum,\nwhen the fermionic chain is uniformly-coupled, we have $J_{T}\\propto1/t^{6}$\nand $J_{TI}\\propto1/t^{3}$. Remarkably, for perfect state transfer (PST)\ncouplings, there always exists an oscillating quantum energy current $J_{TI}$.\nMoreover, it is interesting that $J_{T}$ is proportional to $(N-1)^{1/2}$ at\ncertain times for PST couplings under Lorentz-Drude or Ohmic bath.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 08:18:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Apr 2020 07:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-04"}

Such standard designs may not always suffice from a\nclinical perspective because clinical relevance may call for more. For example,\nproof-of-concept in phase II often requires not only statistical significance\nbut also a sufficiently large effect estimate.\n  Purpose: We propose dual-criterion designs to complement statistical\nsignificance with clinical relevance, discuss their methodology, and illustrate\ntheir implementation in phase II.\n  Methods: Clinical relevance requires the effect estimate to pass a clinically\nmotivated threshold (the decision value). In contrast to standard designs, the\nrequired effect estimate is an explicit design input whereas study power is\nimplicit. The sample size for a dual-criterion design needs careful\nconsiderations of the study's operating characteristics (type-I error, power).\n  Results: Dual-criterion designs are discussed for a randomized controlled and\na single-arm phase II trial, including decision criteria, sample size\ncalculations, decisions under various data scenarios, and operating\ncharacteristics. The designs facilitate GO/NO-GO decisions due to their\ncomplementary statistical-clinical criterion.\n  Conclusion: To improve evidence-based decision-making, a formal yet\ntransparent quantitative framework is important. Dual-criterion designs offer\nan appealing statistical-clinical compromise, which may be preferable to\nstandard designs if evidence against the null hypothesis alone does not suffice\nfor an efficacy claim.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 08:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-10"}

The aim of\nthis paper is to describe, test, and apply a new DEM method named the Solar\nIterative Temperature Emission Solver (SITES). The method creates an initial\nDEM estimate through a direct redistribution of observed intensities across\ntemperatures according to the temperature response function of the measurement,\nand iteratively improves on this estimate through calculation of intensity\nresiduals. It is simple in concept and implementation, is non-subjective in the\nsense that no prior constraints are placed on the solutions other than\npositivity and smoothness, and can process a thousand DEMs per second on a\nstandard desktop computer. The resulting DEMs replicate model DEMs well in\ntests on Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) synthetic data. The same tests show\nthat SITES performs less well on very narrow DEM peaks, and should not be used\nfor temperature diagnostics below ~0.5MK in the case of AIA observations. The\nSITES accuracy of inversion compares well with two other established methods. A\nsimple yet powerful new method to visualise DEM maps is introduced, based on a\nfractional emission measure (FEM). Applied to a set of AIA full-disk images,\nthe SITES method and FEM visualisation show very effectively the dominance of\ncertain temperature regimes in different large-scale coronal structures. The\nmethod can easily be adapted for any multi-channel observations of\noptically-thin plasma and, given its simplicity and efficiency, will facilitate\nthe processing of large existing and future datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 10:03:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

Magnetization measurements reveal\na net magnetization of 4 $\\mu_B$ with Curie temperature of ~780 K. Resistivity\nmeasurement reveals the presence of localization effect below 35 K while above\n100 K, a linear dependence is observed. Resistivity behavior indicates the\nabsence of single magnon scattering, which indirectly supports the\nhalf-metallic nature. The majority spin band near the Fermi level clearly\nindicates the overlap of flat eg bands with sharply varying conduction bands\nthat are responsible for the localization. In-depth analysis of the projected\natomic d-orbital character of band structure reveals unusual bonding, giving\nrise to the flat eg bands purely arising out of Ru ions. Co-Ru swap disorder\ncalculations indicate the robustness of half-metallic nature, even when the\nstructure changes from Y-type to L21-type, with no major change in the net\nmagnetization of the system. Thus, robust half-metallic nature, stable\nstructure, and high Curie temperature make this alloy quite a promising\ncandidate to be used as a source of highly spin-polarized currents in\nspintronic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 11:47:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

Specifically, AS-LRC performs the\nlatent decomposition of given data into a low-rank reconstruction by a\nblock-diagonal codes matrix, a group sparse locality-adaptive salient feature\npart and a sparse error part. To enforce the block-diagonal structures adaptive\nto different real datasets for the low-rank recovery, AS-LRC clearly computes\nan auto-weighting matrix based on the locality-adaptive features and multiplies\nby the low-rank coefficients for direct minimization at the same time.

However, large\ndata in many applications are heterogeneous in the sense of harboring\ndistributional differences between latent groups. Then, the assumption that the\nconditional distribution of response Y given features X is the same for all\nsamples may not hold. Furthermore, in scientific applications, the covariance\nstructure of the features may contain important signals and its learning is\nalso affected by latent group structure. We propose a class of mixture models\nfor paired data (X, Y) that couples together the distribution of X (using\nsparse graphical models) and the conditional Y | X (using sparse regression\nmodels). The regression and graphical models are specific to the latent groups\nand model parameters are estimated jointly (hence the name \"regularized joint\nmixtures\").

Technically, a novel framework called Twin-Projective Latent\nFlexible DPL (TP-DPL) is proposed, which minimizes the twin-incoherence\nconstrained flexibly-relaxed reconstruction error to avoid the possible\nover-fitting issue and produce accurate reconstruction. In this setting, our\nTP-DPL integrates the twin-incoherence based latent flexible DPL and the joint\nembedding of codes as well as salient features by twin-projection into a\nunified model in an adaptive neighborhood-preserving manner. As a result,\nTP-DPL unifies the salient feature extraction, representation and\nclassification. The twin-incoherence constraint on codes and features can\nexplicitly ensure high intra-class compactness and inter-class separation over\nthem. TP-DPL also integrates the adaptive weighting to preserve the local\nneighborhood of the coefficients and salient features within each class\nexplicitly. For efficiency, TP-DPL uses Frobenius-norm and abandons the costly\nl0/l1-norm for group sparse representation. Another byproduct is that TP-DPL\ncan directly apply the class-specific twin-projective reconstruction residual\nto compute the label of data. Extensive results on public databases show that\nTP-DPL can deliver the state-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 13:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-22"}

Transforming these vehicles into electric vehicles would reduce CO2\nemissions and potentially save energy costs in the context of rising fuel\nprices, if a proper energy management of airport service electric vehicles\n(ASEVs) is performed. To perform such an energy management, this paper proposes\na new customized rollout approach, as a near-optimal control method for a new\nASEV dynamics model, which models the ASEV states, their transitions over time,\nand how control decisions affect them. The rollout approach yields a\nnear-optimal control strategy for the ASEVs to transport luggage and to charge\nbatteries, with the objective to minimize the operation cost, which\nincentivizes the charging of the ASEVs to match renewable generation. Case\nstudies demonstrate that the rollout approach effectively overcomes the \"curse\nof dimensionality\". On both typical summer and winter days, the rollout\nalgorithm results in a total cost approximately 10% less than that of the\nunderlying \"greedy charging\" heuristic, which charges a battery whenever its\nstate of charge is not the maximum.

The gradient descent iteration depth has a favorable complexity\nthat is logarithmically dependent on the system size and inverse of the\nprecision. Moreover, the FQE can be further simplified by exploiting\nperturbation theory for the calculations of intermediate matrix elements, and\nobtain results with a precision that satisfies the requirement of chemistry\napplication.

However, its key step, the quantum\nexponential searching algorithm (QESA), which is based on Grover algorithm, is\nnot a sure-success algorithm. Meanwhile, quantum circuits encounter the gate\ndecomposition problem due to variation of the scale of data. In this paper, we\npropose an optimized quantum algorithm for searching maximum and minimum, based\non DHA and the optimal quantum exact search algorithm.

In this\npaper, we present a large Spitzer follow-up program of 300 Herschel ultrared\nDSFGs. We have obtained high-resolution ALMA, NOEMA, and SMA data for 63 of\nthem, which allow us to securely identify the Spitzer/IRAC counterparts and\nclassify them as gravitationally lensed or unlensed. Within the 63 ultrared\nsources with high-resolution data, $\\sim$65% appear to be unlensed, and\n$\\sim$27% are resolved into multiple components. We focus on analyzing the\nunlensed sample by directly performing multi-wavelength spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) modeling to derive their physical properties and compare\nwith the more numerous $z \\sim 2$ DSFG population. The ultrared sample has a\nmedian redshift of 3.3, stellar mass of 3.7 $\\times$ 10$^{11}$ $M_{\\odot}$,\nstar formation rate (SFR) of 730 $M_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, total dust luminosity of\n9.0 $\\times$ 10$^{12}$ $L_{\\odot}$, dust mass of 2.8 $\\times$ 10$^9$\n$M_{\\odot}$, and V-band extinction of 4.0, which are all higher than those of\nthe ALESS DSFGs. Based on the space density, SFR density, and stellar mass\ndensity estimates, we conclude that our ultrared sample cannot account for the\nmajority of the star-forming progenitors of the massive, quiescent galaxies\nfound in infrared surveys. Our sample contains the rarer, intrinsically most\ndusty, luminous and massive galaxies in the early universe that will help us\nunderstand the physical drivers of extreme star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 15:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

These systems are difficult to\nmodel and analyze due to combination of high dimensionality and uncertainty,\nand there has been much interest in obtaining reduced models, in the form of\nstochastic closures, that can replicate their non-Gaussian statistics in many\ndimensions. Here, we propose a data-driven framework to model stationary\nchaotic dynamical systems through nonlinear transformations and a set of\ndecoupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Specifically, we use\noptimal transport to find a transformation from the distribution of time-series\ndata to a multiplicative reference probability measure such as the standard\nnormal distribution. Then we find the set of decoupled SDEs that admit the\nreference measure as the invariant measure, and also closely match the spectrum\nof the transformed data. As such, this framework represents the chaotic time\nseries as the evolution of a stochastic system observed through the lens of a\nnonlinear map. We demonstrate the application of this framework in Lorenz-96\nsystem, a 10-dimensional model of high-Reynolds cavity flow, and reanalysis\nclimate data. These examples show that SDE models generated by this framework\ncan reproduce the non-Gaussian statistics of systems with moderate dimensions\n(e.g. 10 and more), and predict super-Gaussian tails that are not readily\navailable from little training data. These findings suggest that this class of\nmodels provide an efficient hypothesis space for learning strongly nonlinear\nflows from small amounts of data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 20:10:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 20:20:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 18:49:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 02:41:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 23 Jan 2022 03:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

On the other hand, less-expert\nprogrammers have used software transaction memory (STM) to make atomic one or\nmore updates, albeit at a significant performance cost due largely to ordered\nlog updates.\n  In this work, we propose the middle ground of composable persistent\ndatastructures called Minimally Ordered Durable (MOD) datastructures.

They allow multiple updates to one or more datastructures to be atomic\nwith respect to failure. Moreover, we provide a recipe to create more\nrecoverable datastructures.\n  MOD is motivated by our analysis of real Intel Optane PM hardware showing\nthat allowing unordered, overlapping flushes significantly improves\nperformance. MOD reduces ordering by adapting existing techniques for\nout-of-place updates (like shadow paging) with space-reducing structural\nsharing (from functional programming). MOD exposes a Basic interface for single\nupdates and a Composition interface for atomically performing multiple updates.\nRelative to the state-of-the-art Intel PMDK v1.5 STM, MOD improves map, set,\nstack, queue microbenchmark performance by 40%, and speeds up application\nbenchmark performance by 38%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 15:11:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-02"}

The rate of research development in this area is growing very rapidly.\nNovelty of this research direction resides mainly in the peculiarity of the\napplication field, rather than in the methodological approaches, which are (at\nleast up to now) state-of-the-art ML algorithms. Reviewing the literature shows\nthat many of the ML algorithms have not yet been used in this area, and many of\nthe OC applications are not considered yet, which reflects the fact that the\nresearch topic is pristine. Accordingly, tutorial investigations are quiet\nnecessary in this filed to help researchers be aware about the last\nprogressions and cavities of this field. Although several tutorials have been\nreleased recently, they considered this topic from OC view, and neglected ML\nview. However, it is required to have an investigations about the ML algorithms\nused in this subject. Accordingly, for the first time, this paper reviews ML\nfor OC literature from ML viewpoint. This view could be really helpful because\nonly OC experts work on ML for OC, and they are not ML experts, so it could\nreally help them to have a comprehensive view on the ML subjects implantable in\nOC. It has worth to mention that compared with other works, this survey reviews\nmuch more investigations; therefore, it has more generality, and gives the\nreader to have a comprehensive overview on this topic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 04:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-12"}
