Herein, energy storage modeling is one\nof the crucial design benchmarks that must be treated carefully. Understanding\nthe energy storage dynamics and the throughput levels is essential especially\nfor communication systems in which the performance depends solely on harvested\nenergy. While energy outages should be avoided, energy overflows should also be\nprevented in order to utilize all harvested energy. Hence, a simple, yet\ncomprehensive, analytical model that can represent the characteristics of a\ngeneral class of EH wireless communication systems needs to be established. In\nthis paper, invoking tools from large deviation theory along with Markov\nprocesses, a firm connection between the energy state of the battery and the\ndata transmission process over a wireless channel is established for an EH\ntransmitter. In particular, a simple exponential approximation for the energy\noverflow probability is formulated, with which the energy decay rate in the\nbattery as a measure of energy usage is characterized. Then, projecting the\nenergy outages and supplies on a Markov process, a discrete state model is\nestablished and an expression for the energy outage probability for given\nenergy arrival and demand processes is provided. Finally, under energy overflow\nand outage constraints, the average data service (transmission) rate over the\nwireless channel is obtained and the effective capacity of the system, which\ncharacterizes the maximum data arrival rate at the transmitter buffer under\nquality-of-service (QoS) constraints imposed on the data buffer overflow\nprobability, is derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 17:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}

In order to achieve this, we developed a physics and\ngraphics engine that uses hyperbolic trigonometry to calculate and subsequently\nrender the shapes in a 2D space of constant negative or positive curvature in\nreal-time. We have chosen to use polar coordinates to record the parameters of\nthe objects as well as an azimuthal equidistant projection to render the space\nonto the screen because of the multiple useful properties they have. For\nexample, polar coordinate system works well with trigonometric calculations,\ndue to the distance from the reference point (analogous to origin in Cartesian\ncoordinates) being one of the coordinates by definition. Azimuthal equidistant\nprojection is not a typical projection, used for neither spherical nor\nhyperbolic space, however one of the main features of our engine relies on it:\nchanging the curvature of the world in real-time without stopping the execution\nof the application in order to re-calculate the world. This is due to the\nprojection properties that work identically for both spherical and hyperbolic\nspace, as can be seen in the Figure 1 above. We will also be looking at the\ncomplexity analysis of this method as well as renderings that the engine\nproduces. Finally we will be discussing the limitations and possible\napplications of the created engine as well as potential improvements of the\ndescribed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 17:33:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

While quantum algorithms such as adiabatic quantum optimization (AQO)\nand quantum approximate optimization (QAOA) can minimize Hamiltonians, they are\ninadequate for counting ground states. We modify AQO and QAOA to count the\nground states of arbitrary classical spin Hamiltonians, including counting\nground states with arbitrary nonnegative weights attached to them. As a\nconcrete example, we show how our method can be used to count the weighted\nfraction of edge covers on graphs, with user-specified confidence on the\nrelative error of the weighted count, in the asymptotic limit of large graphs.\nWe find the asymptotic computational time complexity of our algorithms, via\nanalytical predictions for AQO and numerical calculations for QAOA, and compare\nwith the classical optimal Monte Carlo algorithm (OMCS), as well as a modified\nGrover's algorithm.

Finding optimal, sparse, accurate models of various\nforms (linear models with integer coefficients, decision sets, rule lists,\ndecision trees) is generally NP-hard. We often do not know whether the search\nfor a simpler model will be worthwhile, and thus we do not go to the trouble of\nsearching for one. In this work, we ask an important practical question: can\naccurate-yet-simple models be proven to exist, or shown likely to exist, before\nexplicitly searching for them? We hypothesize that there is an important reason\nthat simple-yet-accurate models often do exist. This hypothesis is that the\nsize of the Rashomon set is often large, where the Rashomon set is the set of\nalmost-equally-accurate models from a function class. If the Rashomon set is\nlarge, it contains numerous accurate models, and perhaps at least one of them\nis the simple model we desire. In this work, we formally present the Rashomon\nratio as a new gauge of simplicity for a learning problem, depending on a\nfunction class and a data set. The Rashomon ratio is the ratio of the volume of\nthe set of accurate models to the volume of the hypothesis space, and it is\ndifferent from standard complexity measures from statistical learning theory.\nInsight from studying the Rashomon ratio provides an easy way to check whether\na simpler model might exist for a problem before finding it, namely whether\nseveral different machine learning methods achieve similar performance on the\ndata. In that sense, the Rashomon ratio is a powerful tool for understanding\nwhy and when an accurate-yet-simple model might exist. If, as we hypothesize in\nthis work, many real-world data sets admit large Rashomon sets, the\nimplications are vast: it means that simple or interpretable models may often\nbe used for high-stakes decisions without losing accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 17:52:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 03:34:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 23:32:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 20:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-16"}

In the `hit-and-run' model, a lower mass\nprojectile barely hits the more massive Pluto, kicks up some debris, and\nremains bound to Pluto (see also Asphaug et al. 2006). In a `graze-and-merge'\nscenario, the projectile ejects substantial debris as it merges with Pluto (see\nalso Canup 2001). To investigate the graze-and-merge idea in more detail, we\nconsider the growth of Charon-mass objects within a circum-Pluto ring of\nsolids. Numerical calculations demonstrate that Charon analogs form rapidly\nwithin a swarm of planetesimals with initial radii of 145-230 km. On time\nscales of roughly 30-100 days, newly-formed Charon analogs have semimajor axes,\na = 5-6 Pluto radii, and orbital eccentricities, e = 0.1-0.3, similar to Charon\nanalogs that remain bound after hit-and-run collisions with Pluto. Although the\nearly growth of Charon analogs generates rings of small particles at a = 50-275\nPluto radii, ejection of several 145-230 km leftovers by the central\nPluto-Charon binary removes these small solids in 10-100 yr. Simple estimates\nsuggest small particles might survive the passage of 10-20 km objects ejected\nby the central binary. Our results indicate that the Pluto-Charon circumbinary\nsatellite system was not formed by a graze-and-merge impact when the formation\nof Charon within a circum-Pluto disk leads to the ejection of several 100-200\nkm particles through the orbital plane of the Pluto-Charon binary. If a growing\nCharon ejects only much smaller particles, however, graze-and-merge impacts are\na plausible formation channel for the Pluto-Charon binary and an ensemble of\nsmall, circumbinary satellites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

The aim of this paper is to\ninvestigate how accretion from a circumbinary disc can cause this phenomenon of\ndepletion and how this impacts the evolution of post-AGB stars. We used the\n\\texttt{MESA} code to evolve stars in the post-AGB phase, while including\naccretion of metal-poor gas. We compared the models to a sample of 58 observed\ndisc-type post-AGB stars with chemical abundance data. For each of these stars,\nwe estimated the luminosity and the mass using the Gaia distance. We modelled\nthe accretion rate onto the binary from a viscously evolving disc for a range\nof initial accretion rates and disc masses. We find that large initial\naccretion rates ($\\gtrsim 3\\times10^{-7}$ $M_\\odot$/yr) and large initial disc\nmasses ($\\sim10^{-2}$ $M_\\odot$) are needed to reproduce the observed depleted\npost-AGB stars. Based on these high accretion rates, the evolution timescale of\npost-AGB stars can be significantly extended by a factor between two and five.\nWe distinguish depletion patterns that are unsaturated (plateau profile) from\nthose that are saturated, and we expect that post-red giant branch (post-RGB)\nstars are much more likely to show an unsaturated abundance pattern compared to\npost-AGB stars. Finally, because of the slower evolution of the low-mass\npost-RGB stars, we find that these systems can become depleted at lower\neffective temperatures ($< 5000$ K). We conclude that accretion from a\ncircumbinary disc successfully accounts for the chemical peculiarity of\npost-AGB stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 18:08:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 16:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

If the\nSBHB candidates considered are true binaries, this result would suggest that\nthere is a physical process that allows initially unequal mass systems to\nevolve toward comparable mass ratios (e.g., accretion that occurs\npreferentially onto the smaller of the black holes) or point to some, yet\nunspecified, selection bias. Our method also indicates that the SBHB candidates\nequally favor configurations in which the mini-disks are coplanar or misaligned\nwith the binary orbital plane. If confirmed for true SBHBs, this finding would\nindicate the presence of a physical mechanism that maintains misalignment of\nthe mini-disks down to sub-parsec binary separations (e.g., precession driven\nby gravitational torques). The probability distributions of the SBHB parameters\ninferred for the observed SBHB candidates and our control group of AGNs are\nstatistically indistinguishable, implying that this method can in principle be\nused to interpret the observed emission-line profiles once a sample of\nconfirmed SBHBs is available but cannot be used as a conclusive test of\nbinarity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 18:41:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 19:29:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

Current\nservers mostly use CHIPKILL based schemes to tolerate up-to one/two symbol\nerrors per DRAM beat. Multi-symbol errors arising due to faults in multiple\ndata buses and chips may not be detected by these schemes. In this paper, we\nintroduce Single Symbol Correction Multiple Symbol Detection (SSCMSD) - a novel\nerror handling scheme to correct single-symbol errors and detect multi-symbol\nerrors. Our scheme makes use of a hash in combination with Error Correcting\nCode (ECC) to avoid silent data corruptions (SDCs). SSCMSD can also enhance the\ncapability of detecting errors in address bits. We employ 32-bit CRC along with\nReed-Solomon code to implement SSCMSD for a x4 based DDRx system.

These systems\noften arise in fluid mechanics (incompressible Euler equations) and plasma\nphysics (Vlasov--Poisson equations and gyrokinetic equations), for example. The\ndynamics is described by a distribution function that evolves given a\nHamiltonian and a corresponding Poisson bracket operator, with the Hamiltonian\nitself computed from field equations. Hamiltonian systems have several\nconserved quantities, including the quadratic invariants of total energy and\nthe $L_2$ norm of the distribution function. For accurate simulations one must\nensure that these quadratic invariants are conserved by the discrete scheme. We\nshow that using a discontinuous Galerkin scheme to evolve the distribution\nfunction and ensuring that the Hamiltonian lies in its continuous subspace\nleads to an energy-conserving scheme in the continuous-time limit. Further, the\n$L_2$ norm is conserved if central fluxes are used to update the distribution\nfunction, but decays monotonically when using upwind fluxes.

The number of sources may be\nlarger than the number of sensors, but their activity is sparse and\nintermittent with bursty transmission patterns. To account for this, sources\nare modeled as hidden Markov models with known or unknown parameters. The\nproblem of blind source estimation in the absence of channel state information\nis tackled via a novel algorithm, consisting of a dictionary learning (DL)\nstage and a per-source stochastic filtering (PSF) stage. The two stages work in\ntandem, with the latter operating on the output produced by the former. Both\nstages are designed so as to account for the sparsity and memory of the\nsources. To this end, smooth LASSO is integrated with DL, while the\nforward-backward algorithm and Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm are\nleveraged for PSF. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can enhance the\ndetection and the estimation performance of the sources, and that it is robust\nto the sparsity level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 19:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

The input is the\nfinite-volume two-pion spectrum computed using lattice QCD from six ensembles\non lattices elongated in one of the spatial dimensions. A two-flavor dynamical\nlattice QCD action is used with two quark masses corresponding to a pion mass\nof 315 MeV and 224 MeV. The spectrum in the elastic region is subjected to a\nglobal fit which takes into account full correlations across isospin, pion mass\nand decay constant. The parameters from the fit are used to perform a chiral\nextrapolation to the physical point. The cross-channel fit results in a more\nprecise determination of the parameters of the model when compared with single\nchannel fits.

Employing this technique, we show that we can directly\nresolve transmon gate errors at the level of one part in $10^3.$ Extending this\nidea, we apply the same principles to the measurement of a logical qubit\nencoded in a bosonic mode and detected with a transmon ancilla, implementing a\nproposal by Hann et al. [Phys. Rev. A \\textbf{98} 022305 (2018)]. Qubit state\nassignments are made based on a sequence of repeated readouts, further reducing\nthe overall infidelity. This approach is quite general and several encodings\nare studied; the codewords are more distinguishable when the distance between\nthem is increased with respect to photon loss. The tradeoff between multiple\nreadouts and state relaxation is explored and shown to be consistent with the\nphoton-loss model. We report a logical assignment infidelity of $5.8\\times\n10^{-5}$ for a Fock-based encoding and $4.2\\times 10^{-3}$ for a QEC code (the\n$S=2,N=1$ binomial code). Our results will not only improve the fidelity of\nquantum information applications, but also enable more precise characterization\nof process or gate errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 21:32:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 17:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

To\naddress this limitation, the recently proposed Stability Basin (SB) aims to\ncharacterize the set of perturbations that will cause an individual to fall\nunder a specific motor control strategy. The SB is defined as the set of\nconfigurations that do not lead to failure for an individual under their chosen\ncontrol strategy. This paper presents a novel method to compute the SB and the\nfirst experimental validation of the SB with an 11-person perturbative STS\nexperiment involving forwards or backwards pulls from a motor-driven cable. The\nindividually-constructed SBs are used to identify when a trial fails, i.e.,\nwhen an individual must switch control strategies (indicated by a step or sit)\nto recover from a perturbation. The constructed SBs correctly predict the\noutcome of trials where failure was observed with over 90% accuracy, and\ncorrectly predict the outcome of successful trials with over 95% accuracy. The\nSB was compared to three other methods and was found to estimate the stable\nregion with over 45% more accuracy in all cases. This study demonstrates that\nSBs offer a novel model-based approach for quantifying stability during motion,\nwhich could be used in physical therapy for individuals at risk of falling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 21:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

It starts with a large learning rate and then decays it\nmultiple times. It is empirically observed to help both optimization and\ngeneralization. Common beliefs in how lrDecay works come from the optimization\nanalysis of (Stochastic) Gradient Descent: 1) an initially large learning rate\naccelerates training or helps the network escape spurious local minima; 2)\ndecaying the learning rate helps the network converge to a local minimum and\navoid oscillation. Despite the popularity of these common beliefs, experiments\nsuggest that they are insufficient in explaining the general effectiveness of\nlrDecay in training modern neural networks that are deep, wide, and nonconvex.\nWe provide another novel explanation: an initially large learning rate\nsuppresses the network from memorizing noisy data while decaying the learning\nrate improves the learning of complex patterns. The proposed explanation is\nvalidated on a carefully-constructed dataset with tractable pattern complexity.\nAnd its implication, that additional patterns learned in later stages of\nlrDecay are more complex and thus less transferable, is justified in real-world\ndatasets.

It is shown that the presence of non-minimal coupling can significantly\ninfluence the motion of charged particles around Black Holes. In particular,\nthe vacuum polarization effect, leading to strong amplification or suppression\nof the magnetic field strength around the event horizon (depending on the sign\nof the coupling parameter), can affect the scattering angle and minimal\ndistance for the electrons moving in the gravitational field of the Black Hole\nas well as the dependence of these parameters on the asymptotic magnetic field\nstrength, initial distance and the Black Hole mass. It is further demonstrated\nthat the non-minimal coupling between gravity and astrophysical magnetic\nfields, caused by the vacuum polarization, can cause significant changes of the\nparameter space corresponding to bound trajectories around the Black Hole. In\ncertain cases, the bounded or unbounded character of a trajectory is determined\nsolely by the presence of non-minimal coupling and its strength.

Stateful software LBs that run on commodity\nservers provides flexibility, cost-efficiency, and packet consistency. However\ncurrent designs have two main limitations: 1) states are stored as digests\nwhich may cause packet inconsistency due to digest collisions; 2) the data\nplane needs to update for every new connection, and frequent updates hurt\nthroughput and packet consistency. In this work, we present a new software\nstateful LB called Concury, which is the first solution to solve these\nproblems.

The capacity of a network\nexpresses how much sustained throughput can be maintained for a set of\ncommunication demands, and is therefore a fundamental bound on the usefulness\nof a network. Because of this importance, wireless network capacity has been\nactive area of research for the last two decades.\n  The three capacity problems that we study differ in the structure of the\ncommunication demands. The first problem is pairwise capacity, where the\ndemands are (source, destination) pairs. Pairwise capacity is one of the most\nclassical definitions, as it was analyzed in the seminal paper of Gupta and\nKumar on wireless network capacity. The second problem we study is broadcast\ncapacity, in which a single source must deliver packets to all other nodes in\nthe network. Finally, we turn our attention to all-to-all capacity, in which\nall nodes must deliver packets to all other nodes. In all three of these\nproblems we characterize the optimal achievable throughput for any given\nnetwork, and design algorithms which asymptotically match this performance. We\nalso study these problems in networks generated randomly by a process\nintroduced by Gupta and Kumar, and fully characterize their achievable\nthroughput.\n  Interestingly, the techniques that we develop for all-to-all capacity also\nallow us to design a one-shot gossip algorithm that runs within a\npolylogarithmic factor of optimal in every graph.

While enforcing serializability, this model has long been\ncriticized for not satisfying the applications' availability requirements. When\nentering the era of Internet of Things (IoT), this problem has become more\nsevere, as an increasing number of applications call for the capability of\nhybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP), where aggregation\nconstraints need to be enforced as part of transactions. Current systems work\naround this by creating escrows, allowing occasional overshoots of constraints,\nwhich are handled via compensating application logic.\n  The WiSer DBMS targets consistency with availability, by splitting the\ndatabase commit into two steps. First, a PROMISE step that corresponds to what\nhumans are used to as commitment, and runs without talking to a coordinator.\nSecond, a SERIALIZE step, that fixes transactions' positions in the\nserializable order, via a consensus procedure. We achieve this split via a\nnovel data representation that embeds read-sets into transaction deltas, and\nserialization sequence numbers into table rows. WiSer does no sharding (all\nnodes can run transactions that modify the entire database), and yet enforces\naggregation constraints. Both readwrite conflicts and aggregation constraint\nviolations are resolved lazily in the serialized data. WiSer also covers node\njoins and departures as database tables, thus simplifying correctness and\nfailure handling. We present the design of WiSer as well as experiments\nsuggesting this approach has promise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 00:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

A simpler\napproach based on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), focusing on the effects rather\nthan the causes of asymmetries, yields useful insights into the generation of\nshear flows and radial electric field. The crucial point to recognize is that\nan MHD equilibrium in which the plasma pressure is not a flux function can be\nmaintained only by contributions from mass flows. Coupling between the\nasymmetry-generated forces and toroidal geometry results in a strongly up-down\nasymmetric effect, where the flows exhibit a strong dependence on the location\nof the asymmetry with respect to the midplane. This location-dependence can be\nused as an effective control mechanism for the edge and thus the global\nconfinement in tokamaks. It can also explain a number of poorly-understood\nobservations. For instance, strong dependence of the low to high (L-H)\nconfinement transition power threshold $P_{LH}$ on the magnetic topology can be\nqualitatively explained within this framework. Similarly, upper-lower midplane\ndependence of the poloidal flow direction after massive gas injections (MGI)\nnaturally follows from this discussion.

To tackle this issue, this paper presents a novel paradigm for\nthe design of JPEG steganographic distortion cost function, which calculates\nthe distortion cost via a generalized Distortion Cost Domain Transformation\n(DCDT) function. The proposed function comprises the decompressed pixel block\nembedding changes and their corresponding embedding distortion costs for unit\nchange, where the pixel embedding distortion costs are represented in a more\ngeneral exponential model, aiming to flexibly allocate the embedding data. In\nthis way, the JPEG steganography could be formulated as the optimization\nproblem of minimizing the overall distortion cost in its decompressed spatial\ndomain, which is equivalent to maximizing its statistical undetectability\nagainst JPEG phase-aware steganalysis features. Experimental results show that\nthe proposed DCDT equipped with HiLL (a spatial steganographic distortion cost\nfunction) is superior to other state-of-the-art JPEG steganographic schemes,\ne.g., UERD, J-UNIWARD, and GUED in resisting the detection of JPEG phase-aware\nfeature-based steganalyzers GFR and SCA-GFR, and rivals BET-HiLL with one order\nof magnitude lower computational complexity, along with the possibility of\nbeing further improved by considering the mutually dependent embedding\ninteractions.

However, the contents of these collected videos are\noften complicated, and how to efficiently perform set modeling and feature\nextraction is a big challenge for set-based classification algorithms. In\nrecent years, some proposed image set classification methods have made a\nconsiderable advance by modeling the original image set with covariance matrix,\nlinear subspace, or Gaussian distribution. As a matter of fact, most of them\njust adopt a single geometric model to describe each given image set, which may\nlose some other useful information for classification. To tackle this problem,\nwe propose a novel algorithm to model each image set from a multi-geometric\nperspective.

In order to\nfuse these multiple heterogeneous Riemannian manifoldvalued features, the\nwell-equipped Riemannian kernel functions are first utilized to map them into\nhigh dimensional Hilbert spaces.

The-state-of-the-art is the\npart/region-based approaches that first localize discriminative parts/regions,\nand then learn their fine-grained features. However, these approaches have some\ninherent drawbacks: 1) the discriminative feature representation of an object\nis prone to be disturbed by complicated background; 2) it is unreasonable and\ninflexible to fix the number of salient parts, because the intended parts may\nbe unavailable under certain circumstances due to occlusion or incompleteness,\nand 3) the spatial correlation among different salient parts has not been\nthoroughly exploited (if not completely neglected). To overcome these\ndrawbacks, in this paper we propose a new, simple yet robust method by building\npart sequence model on the attended object region. Concretely, we first try to\nalleviate the background effect by using a region attention mechanism to\ngenerate the attended region from the original image. Then, instead of\nlocalizing different salient parts and extracting their features separately, we\nlearn the part representation implicitly by applying a mapping function on the\nserialized features of the object. Finally, we combine the region attending\nnetwork and the part sequence learning network into a unified framework that\ncan be trained end-to-end with only image-level labels.

It is found that the spin conversion\nefficiency depends on the H$_2$ gas density and the surface temperature.

This explains the failure of the Unified theory\nin predicting the SE breakdown as both the structural relaxation and the\ndiffusion process are described by the comparatively fast MCT like dynamics.\nThe study also predicts that other forms of extended MCT will face a similar\nissue. We next modify the Unified theory by applying the concept of renewal\ntheory, usually used in CTRW models where the distribution has a long tail.\nAccording to this theory the first jump given by the persistent time is slower\nthan the subsequent jumps given by the exchange time. We first show that for\nsystems with two waiting time distributions even when both the distributions\nare exponential the persistent time is larger than the exchange time. We also\nidentify the persistent time with the slower activated process. The extended\nUnified theory can now explain the SE breakdown. In this extended theory at low\ntemperatures the structural relaxation is described by the activated dynamics\nwhereas the diffusion is primarily determined by the MCT like dynamics leading\nto a decoupling between them. We also calculate a dynamic lengthscale from the\nwavenumber dependence of the relaxation time. We find that this dynamic length\nscale grows faster than the static length scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 06:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Most existing methods first\nextract multiple types of hand-crafted features and then learn a joint affinity\nmatrix for clustering. The disadvantage lies in two aspects: 1) Multi-view\nrelations are not embedded into feature learning. 2) The end-to-end learning\nmanner of deep learning is not well used in multi-view clustering. To address\nthe above issues, we propose a novel multi-view deep subspace clustering\nnetwork (MvDSCN) by learning a multi-view self-representation matrix in an\nend-to-end manner. MvDSCN consists of two sub-networks, i.e., diversity network\n(Dnet) and universality network (Unet). A latent space is built upon deep\nconvolutional auto-encoders and a self-representation matrix is learned in the\nlatent space using a fully connected layer. Dnet learns view-specific\nself-representation matrices while Unet learns a common self-representation\nmatrix for all views. To exploit the complementarity of multi-view\nrepresentations, Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) is introduced as\na diversity regularization, which can capture the non-linear and high-order\ninter-view relations. As different views share the same label space, the\nself-representation matrices of each view are aligned to the common one by a\nuniversality regularization. Experiments on both multi-feature and\nmulti-modality learning validate the superiority of the proposed multi-view\nsubspace clustering model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 06:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

The analytic model has been set to match the evolution of the\nglobal stellar mass function since redshift $z\\sim 2.3$ and give reasonable\npredictions of the star formation history of galaxies at the same time. We find\nthat stellar mass and environment play different roles: the star formation\nrate/specific star formation rate-$M_*$ relations are independent of the\nenvironment (defined as the halo mass) at any redshift probed, $0<z<1.5$, for\nboth star forming and quiescent galaxies, while the star formation\nrate-$M_{halo}$ relation strongly depends on stellar mass in the same redshift\nrange, for both star forming and quiescent galaxies. Moreover, the star\nformation rate and the specific star formation rate are strongly dependent on\nstellar mass even when the distance from the cluster core is used as a proxy\nfor the environment, rather than the halo mass.

Memory is investigated using a time-fractional order derivative\nequation, which has proven to be a powerful method to understand phenomena with\nlong-term memory. The memoryless case reveals a characteristic time where node\nactivity behaves differently below and above it.

In recent years, the\nsimilarities between inference and decision making triggered much work, from\ndeveloping unified computational frameworks to pondering about the duality\nbetween the two. In spite of these efforts, inference and control, as well as\ninference and belief space planning (BSP) are still treated as two separate\nprocesses. In this paper we propose a paradigm shift, a novel approach which\ndeviates from conventional Bayesian inference and utilizes the similarities\nbetween inference and BSP. We make the key observation that inference can be\nefficiently updated using predictions made during the decision making stage,\neven in light of inconsistent data association between the two. We developed a\ntwo staged process that implements our novel approach and updates inference\nusing calculations from the precursory planning phase.

We first\nformulate two general problems to unify various special cases studied in the\nliterature: (i) the horizon length is $\\textit{a priori}$ fixed; (ii) the\nhorizon length is unspecified but finite for given destination states. Notably,\nboth problems can incorporate time-variant costs, which are rarely considered\nin existing work, and a variety of constraints. The existence of an optimal\ncontrol sequence is analyzed under mild assumptions. Motivated by BCNs' finite\nstate space and control space, we approach the two general problems in an\nintuitive and efficient way under a graph-theoretical framework. A weighted\nstate transition graph and its time-expanded variants are developed, and the\nequivalence between the FHOC problem and the shortest path problem in specific\ngraphs is established rigorously. Two custom algorithms are developed to find\nthe shortest path and construct the optimal control sequence with lower time\ncomplexity, though technically a classical shortest-path algorithm in graph\ntheory is sufficient for all problems. Compared with existing algebraic\nmethods, our graph-theoretical approach can achieve state-of-the-art time\nefficiency while targeting the most general problems. Furthermore, our approach\nis the first one capable of solving Problem (ii) with time-variant costs.\nFinally, the Ara operon genetic network in $\\textit{E. coli}$ is used as a\nbenchmark example to validate the effectiveness of our approach, and the\nresults of two tasks show that our approach can dramatically reduce the running\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 08:43:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 11:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-01"}

Lauga &\nCossu (Phys. Fluids 17, 088106 (2005)) and Min & Kim (Phys.

Here we study the\nstability of channel flow with streamwise and spanwise slip separately as two\nlimiting cases of anisotropic slip and explore a broader range of slip length\nthan previous studies did. We find that, with sufficiently large slip, both\nstreamwise and spanwise slip trigger three-dimensional leading instabilities.\nOverall, the critical Reynolds number is only slightly increased by streamwise\nslip, whereas it can be greatly decreased by spanwise slip. Streamwise slip\nsuppresses the non-modal transient growth, whereas spanwise slip enlarges the\nnon-modal growth although it does not affect the base flow. Interestingly, as\nthe spanwise slip length increases, the optimal perturbations exhibit flow\nstructures different from the well-known streamwise rolls. However, in the\npresence of equal slip in both directions, the three-dimensional leading\ninstabilities disappear and the flow is greatly stabilized. The results suggest\nthat earlier instability and larger transient growth can be triggered by\nintroducing anisotropy in the velocity slip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 09:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

Realizations of PGST networks have so far mostly relied\neither on very special network geometries or imposed conditions such as\ntranscendental on-site potentials. However, it was recently shown [Eisenberg et\nal., arXiv:1804.01645] that PGST generally arises when a network's eigenvectors\nand the factors $P_{\\pm}$ of its characteristic polynomial $P$ fulfill certain\nconditions, where $P_{\\pm}$ correspond to eigenvectors which have $\\pm 1$\nparity on the input and target sites. We combine this result with the so-called\nisospectral reduction of a network to obtain $P_{\\pm}$ from a dimensionally\nreduced form of the Hamiltonian. Equipped with the knowledge of the factors\n$P_{\\pm}$, we show how a variety of setups can be equipped with PGST by proper\ntuning of $P_{\\pm}$. Having demonstrated a method of designing networks\nfeaturing pretty good state transfer of single site excitations, we further\nshow how the obtained networks can be manipulated such that they allow for\nrobust storage of qubits. We hereby rely on the concept of compact localized\nstates, which are eigenstates of a Hamiltonian localized on a small subdomain,\nand whose amplitudes completely vanish outside of this domain.

This results in particularly interpretable models which can be used\nto explain relationships present in the observed data. Bayesian models are\nuseful when an experiment has only a small number of observations and in\napplications where transparency of data driven decisions is important.\nTraditionally, parameter inference in Bayesian statistics has involved\nconstructing bespoke MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) schemes for each newly\nproposed statistical model. This results in plausible models not being\nconsidered since efficient inference schemes are challenging to develop or\nimplement. Probabilistic programming aims to reduce the barrier to performing\nBayesian inference by developing a domain specific language (DSL) for model\nspecification which is decoupled from the parameter inference algorithms. This\npaper introduces functional programming principles which can be used to develop\nan embedded probabilistic programming language.

This problem has been solved using a single network adaptive\ncritic (SNAC) by expressing the forward kinematics as input affine system.\nUsually in SNAC, the critic weights are updated using back propagation\nalgorithm while little attention is given to convergence to the optimal cost.\nIn this paper, we propose a critic weight update law that ensures convergence\nto the desired optimal cost while guaranteeing the stability of the closed loop\nkinematic control. In kinematic control, the robot is required to reach a\nspecific target position. This has been solved as an optimal regulation problem\nin the context of SNAC based kinematic control. When the robot is required to\nfollow a time varying task space trajectory, then the kinematic control has\nbeen framed as an optimal tracking problem. For tracking, an augmented system\nconsisting of tracking error and reference trajectory is constructed and the\noptimal control policy is derived using SNAC framework. The stability and\nperformance of the system under the proposed novel weight tuning law is\nguaranteed using Lyapunov approach.

Moreover, while the force and gap\ndistributions of isostatic jamming present power-law behaviors, even an\ninfinitesimal asphericity is enough to smooth out these singularities.

One important\nchallenge is to sufficiently train these models to yield good generalizations\nfor hard-to-learn pixels. A typical group of such hard-to-learn pixels are\nboundaries between instances. Many studies have proposed to give specific\nattention to learning the boundary pixels. They include designing multi-task\nnetworks with an additional task of boundary prediction and increasing the\nweights of boundary pixels' predictions in the loss function. Such strategies\nrequire defining what to attend beforehand and incorporating this defined\nattention to the learning model. However, there may exist other groups of\nhard-to-learn pixels and manually defining and incorporating the appropriate\nattention for each group may not be feasible. In order to provide a more\nattainable and scalable solution, this paper proposes AttentionBoost, which is\na new multi-attention learning model based on adaptive boosting. AttentionBoost\ndesigns a multi-stage network and introduces a new loss adjustment mechanism\nfor a dense prediction model to adaptively learn what to attend at each stage\ndirectly on image data without necessitating any prior definition about what to\nattend.

This mechanism enables AttentionBoost to learn different attentions\nfor different pixels at the same stage, according to difficulty of learning\nthese pixels, as well as multiple attentions for the same pixel at different\nstages, according to confidence of these stages on their predictions for this\npixel.

Our\nparametric polynomial method avoids this manifestation of the curse of\ndimensionality, which becomes particularly relevant when working with large\ntime series data sets.\n  Two numerical demonstrations are presented. First, a simple regression test\ncase is used to illustrate the method and to compare the performance with\nstandard Artificial Neural Network techniques. Second, a more substantial test\ncase is the inference of a chaotic spatio-temporal dynamical system, the\nLorenz--Emanuel system, from observations. Our method was able to successfully\ntrack the future behaviour of the system over time periods much larger than the\ntraining data sampling rate. Finally, some limitations of the method are\npresented, as well as proposed directions for future work to mitigate these\nlimitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 12:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

In this way, the\ndetector can learn from both labeled and unlabeled data to become robust. In\nthis paper, we propose an interaction mechanism between a teacher and two\nstudents to generate more reliable pseudo labels for unlabeled data, which are\nbeneficial to semi-supervised facial landmark detection.

The teacher learns to judge the\nquality of the pseudo labels generated by the students and filter out\nunqualified samples before the retraining stage. In this way, the student\ndetectors get feedback from their teacher and are retrained by premium data\ngenerated by itself. Since the two students are trained by different samples, a\ncombination of their predictions will be more robust as the final prediction\ncompared to either prediction.

With proper boundary condtions, the least-stable eigenmodes and\ndecay rates are computed. It is again found that the flows are asymptotically\nstable for all $Re$ up to $2500$. It is discovered that the least-stable\neigenmodes have a boundary-layer-structure at high $Re$, although the\nPoiseuille base flow does not exhibits such structure.

Traditional maximum a posterior (MAP) based\nmethods rely heavily on fixed and handcrafted priors that certainly are\ninsufficient in characterizing clean images and blur kernels, and usually adopt\nspecially designed alternating minimization to avoid trivial solution. In\ncontrast, existing deep motion deblurring networks learn from massive training\nimages the mapping to clean image or blur kernel, but are limited in handling\nvarious complex and large size blur kernels. To connect MAP and deep models, we\nin this paper present two generative networks for respectively modeling the\ndeep priors of clean image and blur kernel, and propose an unconstrained neural\noptimization solution to blind deconvolution.

Adaptive optics (AO) systems greatly increase the resolution of\nlarge telescopes, but produce complex point spread function (PSF) shapes,\nvarying in time and across the field of view. This PSF must be accurately known\nsince it provides crucial information about optical systems for design,\ncharacterisation, diagnostics and image post processing. Aims. We develop here\na model of the AO long exposure PSF, adapted to various seeing conditions and\nany AO system. This model is made to match accurately both the core of the PSF\nand its turbulent halo. Methods. The PSF model we develop is based on a\nparsimonious parameterization of the phase power spectral density with only\nfive parameters to describe circularly symmetric PSFs and seven parameters for\nasymmetrical ones. Moreover, one of the parameters is directly the Fried\nparameter r0 of the turbulence s strength. This physical parameter is an asset\nin the PSF model since it can be correlated with external measurements of the\nr0, such as phase slopes from the AO real time computer (RTC) or site seeing\nmonitoring. Results. We fit our model against endtoend simulated PSFs using\nOOMAO tool, and against on sky PSFs from the SPHERE ZIMPOL imager and the MUSE\nintegral field spectrometer working in AO narrowfield mode. Our model matches\nthe shape of the AO PSF both in the core and the halo, with a sub 1 percent\nrelative error for simulated and experimental data. We also show that we\nretrieve the r0 parameter with subcentimeter precision on simulated data. For\nZIMPOL data, we show a correlation of 97 percent between our r0 estimation and\nthe RTC estimation. Finally, MUSE allows us to test the spectral dependency of\nthe fitted r0 parameter. It follows the theoretical $\\lambda^{6/5}$ evolution\nwith a standard deviation of 0.3 cm. Evolution of other PSF parameters, such as\nresidual phase variance or aliasing, is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 15:07:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 11:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-08"}

Multiple instances of COSI attacks have been found in the\npast under different names such as login detection or access detection attacks.\nBut, those attacks only consider two states (e.g., logged in or not) and focus\non a specific browser leak method (or XS-Leak). This work shows that mounting\nmore complex COSI attacks such as deanonymizing the owner of an account,\ndetermining if the victim owns sensitive content, and determining the victim's\naccount type often requires considering more than two states. Furthermore,\nrobust attacks require supporting a variety of browsers since the victim's\nbrowser cannot be predicted apriori. To address these issues, we present a\nnovel approach to identify and build complex COSI attacks that differentiate\nmore than two states and support multiple browsers by combining multiple attack\nvectors, possibly using different XS-Leaks. To enable our approach, we\nintroduce the concept of a COSI attack class. We propose two novel techniques\nto generalize existing COSI attack instances into COSI attack classes and to\ndiscover new COSI attack classes.

In four dimensions, we find that the positions of the potential\nminima and the cosmological constant evolve more rapidly with scale compared to\nthe standard approach, whereas the quartic coupling evolves more slowly, albeit\nby a small amount. These differences may have implications for the asymptotic\nsafety programme, as well as our understanding of the non-perturbative scale\nevolution of the Standard Model Higgs sector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 15:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

We analyzed the daily number of the simple active\nregions (SARs) and compared that to the abundance of the complex active regions\n(CARs) over the entire solar cycle 23 and cycle 24 until December 2018.\nResults. We show that CARs evolve differently over the solar cycle from SARs.\nThe time evolution of SARs and CARs on different hemispheres also shows\ndifferences, even though on average their latitudinal distributions are shown\nto be similar. The time evolution of SARs closely follows that of the sunspot\nnumber, and their maximum abundance was observed to occur during the early\nmaximum phase, while that of the CARs was seen roughly two years later. We\nfurthermore found that the peak of CARs was reached before the latitudinal\nwidth of the activity band starts to decease. Conclusions. Our results suggest\nthat the active region formation process is a competition between the\nlarge-scale dynamo (LSD) and the small-scale dynamo (SSD) near the surface, the\nformer varying cyclically and the latter being independent of the solar cycle.\nDuring solar maximum, LSD is dominant, giving a preference to SARs, while\nduring the declining phase the relative role of SSD increases.

Despite the remarkable improvements of recent approaches, however, these\nmethods are built upon a large set of training image-sentence pairs. The\nexpensive labor efforts hence limit the captioning model to describe the wider\nworld. In this paper, we present a novel network structure, Cascaded Revision\nNetwork, which aims at relieving the problem by equipping the model with\nout-of-domain knowledge. CRN first tries its best to describe an image using\nthe existing vocabulary from in-domain knowledge. Due to the lack of\nout-of-domain knowledge, the caption may be inaccurate or include ambiguous\nwords for the image with unknown (novel) objects. We propose to re-edit the\nprimary captioning sentence by a series of cascaded operations. We introduce a\nperplexity predictor to find out which words are most likely to be inaccurate\ngiven the input image. Thereafter, we utilize external knowledge from a\npre-trained object detection model and select more accurate words from\ndetection results by the visual matching module. In the last step, we design a\nsemantic matching module to ensure that the novel object is fit in the right\nposition. By this novel cascaded captioning-revising mechanism, CRN can\naccurately describe images with unseen objects.

This\nmethod resolves the multispeed and multipath issue when UWB signals propagate\nin dispersive media. In addition, a multipath effect due to refraction on a\ncurved boundary is also explored. By collecting data using a customized\nmicrowave measurement system of two different objects placed in a plastic\ngraduated cylinder filled with glycerin, along the measured dielectric\nparameters of glycerin (a dispersive medium), highquality reconstructed images\nare formed using PSAS. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons with two other\ntraditional time-shift radar-based microwave imaging algorithms for the same\nobjects under test demonstrate the advantages of PSAS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 14:04:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

Due to\nlimitations of hardware technology (unavailability of data acquisition\napparatus), experimental microwave imaging is very challenging for the\npioneers. However, Probably due to the hardware cost, most of the studies\n(operating at a few GHz) were still focused on software only.
