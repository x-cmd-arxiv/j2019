Favoring\ninstead site-based algorithms, we propose three ways to reduce the cost of KMC\nsimulations: 1.

In such temporal experiments, it has\nbeen observed that the effects of an intervention on a given unit may be large\nwhen the unit is first exposed to it, but then it often attenuates, or even\nvanishes, after repeated exposures. This phenomenon is typically due to units'\nhabituation to the intervention, or some other general form of learning, such\nas when users gradually start to ignore repeated mails sent by a promotional\ncampaign. This paper proposes randomized designs for estimating causal effects\nin temporal experiments when habituation is present.

In this work, we investigate how the Earth's magnetosphere has\nresponded to the change in the solar wind. Earth's magnetosphere is simulated\nusing 3D magnetohydrodynamic models that incorporate the evolving local\nproperties of the solar wind. The solar wind, on the other hand, is modelled in\n1.5D for a range of rotation rates Omega from 50 to 0.8 times the present-day\nsolar rotation (Omega_sun). Our solar wind model uses empirical values for\nmagnetic field strengths, base temperature and density, which are derived from\nobservations of solar-like stars. We find that for rotation rates ~10\nOmega_sun, Earth's magnetosphere was substantially smaller than it is today,\nexhibiting a strong bow shock. As the sun spins down, the magnetopause standoff\ndistance varies with Omega^{-0.27} for higher rotation rates (early ages, > 1.4\nOmega_sun), and with Omega^{-2.04} for lower rotation rates (older ages, < 1.4\nOmega_sun). This break is a result of the empirical properties adopted for the\nsolar wind evolution. We also see a linear relationship between magnetopause\ndistance and the thickness of the shock on the subsolar line for the majority\nof the evolution (< 10 Omega_sun). It is possible that a young fast rotating\nSun would have had rotation rates as high as 30 to 50 Omega_sun. In these\nspeculative scenarios, at 30 Omega_sun, a weak shock would have been formed,\nbut for 50 Omega_sun, we find that no bow shock could be present around Earth's\nmagnetosphere. This implies that with the Sun continuing to spin down, a strong\nshock would have developed around our planet, and remained for most of the\nduration of the solar main sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 16:55:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 13:31:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

One of the\nkey problems is how to acquire high-quality frame labels for untranscribed\ntraining data to facilitate supervised DNN training. It is shown that learning\nof robust BNF representations can be achieved by effectively leveraging\ntranscribed speech data and well-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nsystems from one or more out-of-domain (resource-rich) languages. Out-of-domain\nASR systems can be applied to perform speaker adaptation with untranscribed\ntraining data of the target language, and to decode the training speech into\nframe-level labels for DNN training. It is also found that better frame labels\ncan be generated by considering temporal dependency in speech when performing\nframe clustering. The proposed methods of feature learning are evaluated on the\nstandard task of unsupervised subword modeling in Track 1 of the ZeroSpeech\n2017 Challenge. The best performance achieved by our system is $9.7\\%$ in terms\nof across-speaker triphone minimal-pair ABX error rate, which is comparable to\nthe best systems reported recently.

However, the best studied objects with VLTI/MIDI show that\ninstead a polar dusty wind is dominating these wavelengths, leaving little room\nfor a torus contribution. But is this wind an ubiquitous part of the AGN? To\ntest this, we conducted a straightforward detection experiment, using the\nupgraded VLT/VISIR for deep subarcsecond resolution MIR imaging of a sample of\nnine [O IV]-bright, obscured AGN, all of which were predicted to have\ndetectable polar emission. Indeed, the new data reveal such emission in all\nobjects but one.

These findings support the scenario that polar dust is not only\nubiquitous in AGN but also an integral part of its structure, processing a\nsignificant part of the primary radiation. The polar dust has to be optically\nthin on average, which explains, e.g., the small dispersion in the observed\nmid-infrared--X-ray luminosity correlation. At the same time, it has to be\ntaken into account when deriving covering factors of obscuring material from\nmid-infrared to bolometric luminosity ratios.

In particular, the criterion suggests a canonical way of\ndealing with penalties, consisting in assigning infinite costs to directions\nnot belonging to the gate set. We discuss how this can be implemented through\nthe use of Lagrange multipliers. We argue that one of the surviving cost\nfunctions defines a particularly canonical notion in the sense that: i) it\nstraightforwardly follows from the standard Hermitian metric in Hilbert space;\nii) its associated complexity functional is closely related to Kirillov's\ncoadjoint orbit action, providing an explicit realization of the ``complexity\nequals action'' idea; iii) it arises from a Hamilton-Jacobi analysis of the\n``quantum action'' describing quantum dynamics in the phase space canonically\nassociated to every Hilbert space. Finally, we explain how these structures\nprovide a natural framework for characterizing chaos in classical and quantum\nsystems on an equal footing, find the minimal geodesic connecting two nearby\ntrajectories, and describe how complexity measures are sensitive to Lyapunov\nexponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

MCTDH-B\nand MCTDH-F or, together, MCTDH-X are methods for describing correlated quantum\nsystems of identical particles by solving the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation from first principles. MCTDH-X is used to accurately model the\ndynamics of real-world quantum many-body systems in atomic, molecular, and\noptical physics. The key feature of these approaches is the time-dependence and\noptimization of the single-particle states employed for the construction of a\nmany-body basis set, which yields nonlinear working equations. We briefly\ndescribe the historical developments that have lead to the formulation of the\nMCTDH-X methods and motivate the necessity for wavefunction-based approaches.\nWe sketch the derivation of the unified MCTDH-F and MCTDH-B equations of motion\nfor complete and also specific restricted configuration spaces. The strengths\nand limitations of the MCTDH-X approach are assessed via benchmarks against an\nexactly solvable model and via convergence checks. We highlight some\napplications to instructive and experimentally-realized quantum many-body\nsystems: the dynamics of atoms in Bose-Einstein condensates in magneto-optical\nand optical traps and of electrons in atoms and molecules. We discuss the\ncurrent development and frontiers in the field of MCTDH-X: theories and\nnumerical methods for indistinguishable particles, for mixtures of multiple\nspecies of indistinguishable particles, the inclusion of nuclear motion for the\nnonadiabatic dynamics of atomic and molecular systems, as well as the\nmultilayer and second-quantized-representation approaches, and the\norbital-adaptive time-dependent coupled-cluster theory are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 16:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

Various single-mode bosonic quantum error-correcting codes such as\ncat, binomial, and GKP codes have been implemented experimentally in circuit\nQED and trapped ion systems. Moreover, there have been many theoretical\nproposals to scale up such single-mode bosonic codes to realize large-scale\nfault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, we consider the concatenation of the\nsingle-mode GKP code with the surface code, namely, the surface-GKP code. In\nparticular, we thoroughly investigate the performance of the surface-GKP code\nby assuming realistic GKP states with a finite squeezing and noisy circuit\nelements due to photon losses. By using a minimum-weight perfect matching\ndecoding algorithm on a 3D space-time graph, we show that fault-tolerant\nquantum error correction is possible with the surface-GKP code if the squeezing\nof the GKP states is higher than 11.2dB in the case where the GKP states are\nthe only noisy elements. We also show that the squeezing threshold changes to\n18:6dB when both the GKP states and circuit elements are comparably noisy. At\nthis threshold, each circuit component fails with probability 0.69%. Finally,\nif the GKP states are noiseless, fault-tolerant quantum error correction with\nthe surface-GKP code is possible if each circuit element fails with probability\nless than 0.81%. We stress that our decoding scheme uses the additional\ninformation from GKP-stabilizer measurements and we provide a simple method to\ncompute renormalized edge weights of the matching graphs. Furthermore, our\nnoise model is general as it includes full circuit-level noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 18:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 16:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-14"}

They are classified as classical systems and\nthe supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs). The different behavior of these\nsub-classes of sources in X-rays, with SFXTs displaying much more pronounced\nvariability, is usually (at least) partly ascribed to different physical\nproperties of the massive star clumpy stellar wind. In case of SFXTs, a\nsystematic investigation of the effects of clumps on flares/outbursts of these\nsources has been reported by Bozzo et al. (2017) exploiting the capabilities of\nthe instruments on-board XMM-Newton to perform a hardness-resolved spectral\nanalysis on timescales as short as a few hundreds of seconds. In this paper, we\nuse six XMM-Newton observations of IGR J18027-2016 to extend the above study to\na classical supergiant X-ray binary and compare the findings with those derived\nin the case of SFXTs. As these observations of IGR J18027-2016 span different\norbital phases, we also study its X-ray spectral variability on longer\ntimescales and compare our results with previous publications. Although\nobtaining measurements of the clump physical properties from X-ray observations\nof accreting supergiant X-ray binaries was already proven to be challenging,\nour study shows that similar imprints of clumps are found in the X-ray\nobservations of the supergiant fast X-ray transients and at least one classical\nsystem, i.e. IGR J18027-2016.

This\nnew nonvolatile DIMM supports byte-granularity accesses with access times on\nthe order of DRAM, while also providing data storage that survives power\noutages. Researchers have not idly waited for real nonvolatile DIMMs (NVDIMMs)\nto arrive. Over the past decade, they have written a slew of papers proposing\nnew programming models, file systems, libraries, and applications built to\nexploit the performance and flexibility that NVDIMMs promised to deliver.

However, such a technique is\nprone to overfitting, owing to the lack of regularization methods and the\ndependence of the aforementioned technique on local geometry. In this study,\nfocusing on binary imbalanced data classification, a novel dynamic ensemble\nmethod, namely adaptive ensemble of classifiers with regularization (AER), is\nproposed, to overcome the stated limitations. The method solves the overfitting\nproblem through implicit regularization. Specifically, it leverages the\nproperties of stochastic gradient descent to obtain the solution with the\nminimum norm, thereby achieving regularization; furthermore, it interpolates\nthe ensemble weights by exploiting the global geometry of data to further\nprevent overfitting. According to our theoretical proofs, the seemingly\ncomplicated AER paradigm, in addition to its regularization capabilities, can\nactually reduce the asymptotic time and memory complexities of several other\nalgorithms. We evaluate the proposed AER method on seven benchmark imbalanced\ndatasets from the UCI machine learning repository and one artificially\ngenerated GMM-based dataset with five variations.

Prior attempts at investigating the asymmetric impacts\nfollow a mean-eddy partitioning that condenses the effect of all the\nasymmetries into one term and fails to highlight the differences in the role of\nasymmetries at different scales. In this study, we present a novel\nenergetics-based approach to analyze the asymmetric impacts at multiple\nlength-scales during periods of TC rapid intensity changes. Using model outputs\nof TCs under low and high shear, we compute the different energy pathways that\nenhance/suppress the growth of multi-scale asymmetries in the wavenumber (WN)\ndomain. We then compare and contrast the energetics of the mean flow field (WN\n0) with that of the persistent, coherent vortex-scale asymmetric structures\n(WNs 1,2) and the more local, transient, sub-vortex-scale asymmetries (WNs\n$\\geq$ 3). We find in our case-studies that the dominant mechanisms of\ngrowth/decay of the asymmetries are the baroclinic conversion from available\npotential to kinetic energy at individual scales of asymmetries, and the\ntransactions of kinetic energy between the asymmetries of various\nlength-scales; rather than the barotropic mean-eddy transactions as is\ntypically assumed. Our case-study analysis further shows that the growth/decay\nof asymmetries is largely independent of the mean.

The method\ncombines the perspectives of model reduction and machine learning. Model\nreduction brings in the physics of the problem, constraining the ROM\npredictions to lie on a subspace defined by the governing equations. This is\nachieved by defining the ROM in proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)\ncoordinates, which embed the rich physics information contained in solution\nsnapshots of a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The\nmachine learning perspective brings the flexibility to use transformed physical\nvariables to define the POD basis. This is in contrast to traditional model\nreduction approaches that are constrained to use the physical variables of the\nhigh-fidelity code. Combining the two perspectives, the approach identifies a\nset of transformed physical variables that expose quadratic structure in the\ncombustion governing equations and learns a quadratic ROM from transformed\nsnapshot data. This learning does not require access to the high-fidelity model\nimplementation. Numerical experiments show that the ROM accurately predicts\ntemperature, pressure, velocity, species concentrations, and the limit-cycle\namplitude, with speedups of more than five orders of magnitude over\nhigh-fidelity models.

By drawing the analogy between\ninductor-capacitor circuit lattices and quantum mechanical tight-binding (TB)\nmodels, we show that the energy flux in a TE network is analogous to the\nprobability flux in a TB Hamiltonian. TE systems offer a key advantage in that\nthey can be easily tuned to achieve different topological WSM phases simply by\nvarying the capacitances and inductances. The above analogy opens the way to\nthe study of tunneling across heterojunctions separating different types of\nWSMs in TE circuits, a situation which is virtually impossible to realize in\nphysical WSM materials. We show that the energy flux transmission in a WSM\nheterostructure depends highly on the relative orientation of the transport\ndirection and the $k$-space tilt direction. For the transmission from a Type I\nWSM source lead to a Type II WSM drain lead, all valleys transmit equally when\nthe tilt and transmission directions are perpendicular to each other. In\ncontrast, large inter-valley scattering is required for transmission when the\ntilt and transport directions are parallel to each other, leading to\nvalley-dependent transmission. We describe a Type III WSM phase intermediate\nbetween the Type I and Type II phases. An `anti-Klein' tunneling occurs between\na Type I source and Type III drain where the transmission is totally suppressed\nfor some valleys at normal incidence. This is in direct contrast to the usual\nKlein tunneling in Dirac materials where normally incident flux is perfectly\ntransmitted. Owing to the ease of fabrication and experimental accessibility,\nTE circuits offer an excellent testbed to study the extraordinary transport\nphenomena in WSM based heterostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 21:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

Although experimental data including\nstripe/quasi-stripe structure and hidden states have been reported, the ground\nstate of ultrathin MX$ _2$ compounds and, in particular, the origin of\nanisotropic (stripe and quasi-stripe) CDW phases is a long-standing problem.\nAnisotropic CDW phases have been explained by Coulomb interaction between\ndomain walls and inter-layer interaction. However, these models assume that\nanisotropic domain walls can exist in the first place. Here, we report that\nanisotropic CDW domain walls can appear naturally without assuming anisotropic\ninteractions: We explain the origin of these phases by topological defect\ntheory (line defects in a two-dimensional plane) and interference between\nharmonics of macroscopic CDW wave functions. We revisit the\nMcMillan-Nakanishi-Shiba model for monolayer 1$T$-TaS$ _2$ and 2$H$-TaSe$ _2$\nand show that CDWs with wave vectors that are separated by $120^\\circ$ (i.e.\nthe three-fold rotation symmetry of the underlying lattice) contain a\nfree-energy landscape with many local minima.

Our results imply that Coulomb interaction\nbetween domain walls and inter-layer interaction may be secondary factors for\nthe appearance of these phases. Furthermore, this model can predict new CDW\nphases, hence it may become the basis to study CDW further.

We show that\nB0031-07's three drift modes (A, B, and C) can be understood in terms of a\nsingle carousel rotation rate if the number of sparks is allowed to change by\nan integral number, and where the different drift rates are due to\n(first-order) aliasing effects.

An outstanding need of such quantum network is to have high\nfidelity and efficiency on-chip state transfer between distant nodes. Although\nthe nodes are naturally connected via waveguides, it is challenging to fulfill\nthis need because stringent conditions such as spatial mode-matching\nconfiguration and time-reversal symmetry have to be satisfied. Here we report a\ntype of quantum photonic nodes consisting of single quantum emitters and\ncascaded microring resonators for on-chip state transfer.

And the task is to estimate the total count in\na crowd scene. Most of the state-of-the-art methods are based on density map\nestimation, which convert the sparse point annotations into a \"ground truth\"\ndensity map through a Gaussian kernel, and then use it as the learning target\nto train a density map estimator. However, such a \"ground-truth\" density map is\nimperfect due to occlusions, perspective effects, variations in object shapes,\netc. On the contrary, we propose \\emph{Bayesian loss}, a novel loss function\nwhich constructs a density contribution probability model from the point\nannotations. Instead of constraining the value at every pixel in the density\nmap, the proposed training loss adopts a more reliable supervision on the count\nexpectation at each annotated point. Without bells and whistles, the loss\nfunction makes substantial improvements over the baseline loss on all tested\ndatasets. Moreover, our proposed loss function equipped with a standard\nbackbone network, without using any external detectors or multi-scale\narchitectures, plays favourably against the state of the arts.

We demonstrate that hole patterns with very\nhigh Q factors can be efficiently found by the iteration procedure consisting\nof: machine learning of the relation between the hole pattern and the\ncorresponding Q factor, and new dataset generation based on the regression\nfunction obtained by machine learning. First a dataset comprising randomly\ngenerated cavity structures and their first principles Q factors is prepared.\nThen a deep neural network is trained using the initial dataset to obtain a\nregression function that approximately predicts the Q factors from the\nstructural parameters. Several candidates for higher Q factors are chosen by\nsearching the parameter space using the regression function. After adding these\nnew structures and their first principles Q factors to the training dataset,\nthe above process is repeated. As an example, a standard silicon-based L3\ncavity is optimized by this method. A cavity design with a high Q factor\nexceeding 11 million is found within 101 iteration steps and a total of 8070\ncavity structures. This theoretical Q factor is more than twice of the\npreviously reported record values of the cavity designs detected by the\nevolutionary algorithm and the leaky mode visualization method.

As a preliminary\nstudy, we performed a canonical quantization of the Proca model to describe a\nmassive vector particle that shares common properties with the massive\nsymmetric rank-two tensor model. By performing a canonical analysis of the\nLagrangian, which describes the symmetric rank-two tensor, obtained by Siegel\nand Zwiebach (SZ) from string field theory, we deduced that the Lagrangian\npossesses only first class constraints that generate local gauge\ntransformation. By explicit calculations, we show that the massive symmetric\nrank-two tensor theory is gauge invariant only in the critical dimension of\nopen bosonic string theory, i.e., $d=26$. This emphasizes that the origin of\nlocal symmetry is the nilpotency of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST)\noperator, which is valid only in the critical dimension. For a particular gauge\nimposed on the Stueckelberg fields, the gauge-invariant Lagrangian of the SZ\nmodel reduces to the Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian of a massive spin-two particle.\nThus, the Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian is a gauge-fixed version of the\ngauge-invariant Lagrangian for a massive symmetric rank-two tensor. By noting\nthat the Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian is not suitable for studying massive spin-two\nparticles with small masses, we propose the transverse-traceless (TT) gauge to\nquantize the SZ model as an alternative gauge condition. In the TT gauge, the\ntwo Stueckelberg fields can be decoupled from the symmetric rank-two tensor and\nintegrated trivially.

In addition to the 41\nindividual AGN SEDs, we have produced 72 Seyfert SEDs by mixing SEDs of the\ncentral regions of Seyferts with galaxy SEDs. Relative to the literature, our\ntemplates have broader wavelength coverage and/or higher spectral resolution.\nWe have tested the utility of our SEDs by using them to generate photometric\nredshifts for 0 < z < 6.12 AGNs in the Bootes field (selected with X-ray, IR\nand optical criteria) and, relative to SEDs from the literature, they produce\ncomparable or better photometric redshifts with reduced flux density residuals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Aug 2019 09:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Does such a phenomenon exist in single cells, which are the\nbuilding blocks of tissues? One expects an individual cell to compression\nsoften since the semiflexible biopolymer-based cytoskeletal network maintains\nthe mechanical integrity of the cell and in vitro semiflexible biopolymer\nnetworks typically compression soften. To the contrary, we find that mouse\nembryonic fibroblasts (mEFs) compression stiffen under uniaxial compression via\natomic force microscopy (AFM) studies. To understand this finding, we uncover\nseveral potential mechanisms for compression stiffening. First, we study a\nsingle semiflexible polymer loop modeling the actomyosin cortex enclosing a\nviscous medium modeled as an incompressible fluid. Second, we study a\ntwo-dimensional semiflexible polymer/fiber network interspersed with\narea-conserving loops, which are a proxy for vesicles and fluid-based\norganelles. Third, we study two-dimensional fiber networks with\nangular-constraining crosslinks, i.e. semiflexible loops on the mesh scale. In\nthe latter two cases, the loops act as geometric constraints on the fiber\nnetwork to help stiffen it via increased angular interactions. We find that the\nsingle semiflexible polymer loop model agrees well with our AFM experiments\nuntil approximately 35% compressive strain. We also find for the fiber network\nwith area-conserving loops model that the stress-strain curves are sensitive to\nthe packing fraction and size distribution of the area-conserving loops,\nthereby creating a mechanical fingerprint across different cell types. Finally,\nwe make comparisons between this model and experiments on fibrin networks\ninterlaced with beads as well as discuss the tissue-scale implications of\ncellular compression stiffening.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Aug 2019 10:45:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 04:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

To fast localize\nand quantitively evaluate the acute ischemic stroke (AIS) lesions, many\ndeep-learning-based lesion segmentation methods have been proposed in the\nliterature, where a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on\nhundreds of fully labeled subjects with accurate annotations of AIS lesions.\nDespite that high segmentation accuracy can be achieved, the accurate labels\nshould be annotated by experienced clinicians, and it is therefore very\ntime-consuming to obtain a large number of fully labeled subjects.

Unfortunately, little\nresearch focuses on cross-modal correlation learning where temporal structures\nof different data modalities, such as audio and video, should be taken into\naccount. Music video retrieval by given musical audio is a natural way to\nsearch and interact with music contents. In this work, we study cross-modal\nmusic video retrieval in terms of emotion similarity. Particularly, audio of an\narbitrary length is used to retrieve a longer or full-length music video. To\nthis end, we propose a novel audio-visual embedding algorithm by Supervised\nDeep CanonicalCorrelation Analysis (S-DCCA) that projects audio and video into\na shared space to bridge the semantic gap between audio and video. This also\npreserves the similarity between audio and visual contents from different\nvideos with the same class label and the temporal structure. The contribution\nof our approach is mainly manifested in the two aspects: i) We propose to\nselect top k audio chunks by attention-based Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM)model, which can represent good audio summarization with local\nproperties. ii) We propose an end-to-end deep model for cross-modal\naudio-visual learning where S-DCCA is trained to learn the semantic correlation\nbetween audio and visual modalities.

When partial melting occurs at depth, the\npartitioning of NGs between phases is controlled by a distribution coefficient\nthat can be determined from the solubility of the NGs in each phase. Here we\nreport quantitative calculations of the solubility of He, Ne, Ar and Xe in\ncarbonate melts based on molecular dynamics simulations. The NG solubilities\nare first calculated in K2CO3-CaCO3 mixtures at 1 bar and favorably compared to\nthe only experimental data available to date. Then we investigate the effect of\npressure (up to 6 GPa), focusing on two melt compositions: a dolomitic one and\na natrocarbonatitic one (modeling the lava of Ol Doinyo Lengai). The solubility\ndecreases with the amount of alkaline-earth cation in the melt and with the\nsize of the noble gas. In the natrocarbonatitic melt, Henry's law is fulfilled\nat low pressures (up to ~ 0.1 GPa). At higher pressures the solubility levels\noff or even starts to diminish smoothly. In contrast, in molten dolomite the\neffect of pressure is negligible on the studied P range (3-6 GPa). At the\npressures of the Earth's mantle, the solubilities of noble gases in carbonate\nmelts are still of the same order of magnitude as the ones in molten silicates\n(~ 1-10 mol%). This suggests that carbonatitic melts at depth are not\npreferential carriers of noble gases, even if the dependence with the melt\ncomposition is not negligible and has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\nFinally we evaluate the surface tension at the interface between carbonate\nmelts and noble gases and its evolution with pressure.

In this paper, a new\nMARL, called Cooperative double Q-learning (Co-DQL), is proposed, which has\nseveral prominent features. It uses a highly scalable independent double\nQ-learning method based on double estimators and the UCB policy, which can\neliminate the over-estimation problem existing in traditional independent\nQ-learning while ensuring exploration.

Szilard engines are in general\noperated by a Maxwell's Demon where Landauer's principle resolves the apparent\nparadoxes. Here we propose a Szilard engine setup without featuring an explicit\nMaxwell's demon. In a demonless Szilard engine, the acquisition of which-side\ninformation is not required, but erasure and the related heat dissipation still\ntake place implicitly by the very nature of the work extraction process. We see\nthat the insertion of the partition in a quantum Szilard engine does not\nlocalize the particle to one side, instead it creates a superposition state of\nthe particle being in both sides. To be able to extract work from the system,\nparticle has to be localized at one side. The localization occurs as a result\nof quantum measurement on the particle, which shows the importance of the\nmeasurement process regardless of whether one uses the acquired information or\nnot. In accordance with the Landauer's principle, localization by quantum\nmeasurement corresponds to a logically irreversible operation and for this\nreason it has to be accompanied by the corresponding heat dissipation. This\nshows the validity of the Landauer's principle even in quantum Szilard engines\nwithout Maxwell's demon. Furthermore, we take quantum confinement effects fully\ninto account to analyze the Szilard cycle in the quantum regime thoroughly and\nobtain highly accurate analytical expressions for work and heat exchanges. Our\nresults show that Landauer's principle holds the key role to understand the\nthermodynamics of the localization of the particle by quantum measurement,\nwhich explicitly saves the second law in demonless engines and shows that\nquantum-mechanical considerations are essential to reconcile thermodynamics and\ninformation theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 16:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

While it has shown\noutstanding performance compared to several state-of-the-art OBL variants, the\nhigh computational cost of BetaCOBL may hinder it from cost-sensitive\noptimization problems.
