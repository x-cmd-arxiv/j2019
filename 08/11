This coupling is well-captured by augmenting the\nplanning objective with a posterior-covariance penalty -- however, prediction\nof the estimator covariance is challenging when the observation model depends\non unknown landmarks, as is the case in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping\n(SLAM). This paper addresses these challenges in the case of landmark- and\nSLAM-based estimators, enabling efficient prediction (and ultimately\nminimization) of this performance metric. First, we provide an interval-based\nfiltering approximation of the SLAM inference process which allows for\nrecursive propagation of the ego-covariance while avoiding the quadratic\ncomplexity of explicitly tracking landmark uncertainty. Secondly, we introduce\na Lie-derivative measurement bundling scheme that simplifies the recursive\n\"bundled\" update, representing significant computational savings for high-rate\nsensors such as cameras. Finally, we identify a large class of measurement\nmodels (which includes orthographic camera projection) for which the\ncontributions from each landmark can be directly combined, making evaluation of\nthe information gained at each timestep (nearly) independent of the number of\nlandmarks. This also enables the generalization from finite sets of landmarks\n$\\{\\ell^{(n)} \\}$ to distributions, foregoing the need for fully-specified\nlinearization points at planning time and allowing for new landmarks to be\nanticipated.

Introduction of large\nscale geometries poses several questions. The first question asks to study the\npartial order induced by quasi-isometries. This partial order compares large\nscale geometries; as such it presents an algebraic tool for classification of\nglobal patterns. We prove there is a greatest large scale geometry and\ninfinitely many minimal large scale geometries. The second question is related\nto understanding the quasi-isometric maps on various classes of strings. The\nthird question investigates the sets of large scale geometries of strings\naccepted by computational models, e.g. B\\\"uchi automata.

We show that for the classical network ensemble in which the only\nconstraints are the expected degrees a power-law degree distribution is\noptimal. Also, we study spatially embedded networks finding that the\ninteractions between nodes naturally lead to non-uniform spread of nodes in the\nspace, with pairs of nodes at a given distance not necessarily obeying a\npower-law distribution. The pertinent features of real-world air transportation\nnetworks are well described by the proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Aug 2019 21:35:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 18:08:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 22:08:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 11:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

Some of the data instances\nwithin a multi-modal context are often not anomalous when they are viewed\nseparately in each individual modality, but contains inconsistent patterns when\nmultiple sources are jointly considered. The existence of multi-modal data in\nmany real-world scenarios brings both opportunities and challenges to the\ncanonical task of anomaly detection. On the one hand, in multi-modal data,\ninformation of different modalities may complement each other in improving the\ndetection performance. On the other hand, complicated distributions across\ndifferent modalities call for a principled framework to characterize their\ninherent and complex correlations, which is often difficult to capture with\nconventional linear models.

Most\nexisting approaches independently address task-transferability and cross-domain\nadaptation, resulting in limited generalization. In this paper, we propose\nUM-Adapt - a unified framework to effectively perform unsupervised domain\nadaptation for spatially-structured prediction tasks, simultaneously\nmaintaining a balanced performance across individual tasks in a multi-task\nsetting. To realize this, we propose two novel regularization strategies; a)\nContour-based content regularization (CCR) and b) exploitation of inter-task\ncoherency using a cross-task distillation module. Furthermore, avoiding a\nconventional ad-hoc domain discriminator, we re-utilize the cross-task\ndistillation loss as output of an energy function to adversarially minimize the\ninput domain discrepancy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate\nsuperior generalizability of the learned representations simultaneously for\nmultiple tasks under domain-shifts from synthetic to natural environments.\nUM-Adapt yields state-of-the-art transfer learning results on ImageNet\nclassification and comparable performance on PASCAL VOC 2007 detection task,\neven with a smaller backbone-net.

Among the\nclassical theories of neural coding, the population rate coding has been\nstudied widely in many works. Most computational studies considered the neurons\nand the corresponding presynaptic synapses as pre-determined excitatory or\ninhibitory types. According to physiological evidence, however, that the real\neffect of a synapse is inhibitory or excitatory is determined by the type of\nthe activated receptors. The co-release of excitatory and inhibitory receptors\nin the same synapse exists widely in the brain. In this paper, we study the\npopulation rate coding in recurrent neuronal networks with undetermined neurons\nand synapses, different from the traditional works, in which one neuron can\nperform either excitatory or inhibitory effect to the corresponding\npostsynaptic neurons. We find such neuronal networks can encode the stimuli\ninformation in population firing rate well. We find that intermediate recurrent\nprobability together with moderate Inhibitory-Excitatory strength ratio can\nenhance the encoding performance. Suitable combinations of the previous two\nparameters with the noise intensity, the excitatory synaptic strength and the\nsynaptic time constant have promoting effects on the performance of population\nrate coding. Finally, we compare the performance of population rate coding\nbetween the traditional (determined) model and ours, and we find that it is\nrational to consider the co-release of inhibitory and excitatory receptors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 2019 11:23:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

Common time-varying source localization methods assume the source\ncurrent with a time-varying structure and solve the MEG inverse problem by\nmainly estimating the source moment parameters. These methods use the fact that\nthe magnetic fields linearly depend on the moment parameters of the source, and\nwork well under the linear dynamic system. However, magnetic fields are known\nto be non-linearly related to the location parameters of the source. The\nexisting work on estimating the time-varying unknown location parameters is\nlimited. We are motivated to investigate the source distribution for the\nlocation parameters based on a dynamic framework, where the posterior\ndistribution of the source is computed in a closed form discretely. The new\nframework allows us not only to directly approximate the posterior distribution\nof the source current, where sequential sampling methods may suffer from slow\nconvergence due to the large volume of measurement, but also to quantify the\nsource distribution at any time point from the entire set of measurements\nreflecting the distribution of the source, rather than using only the\nmeasurements up to the time point of interest.

While the\napplication of predictive analytics in ICU patients has shown early promising\nresults, much of the work has been encumbered by high false-alarm rates.\nEfforts to improve specificity have been limited by several factors, most\nnotably the difficulty of labeling sepsis onset time and the low prevalence of\nseptic-events in the ICU.

The\nmain challenge of cross-domain recommendation is to weigh and learn users'\ndifferent behaviors in multiple domains. In this paper, we propose a\nCross-Domain collaborative filtering model following a Translation-based\nstrategy, namely CDT. In our model, we learn the embedding space with\ntranslation vectors and capture high-order feature interactions in users'\nmultiple preferences across domains. In doing so, we efficiently compute the\ntransitivity between feature latent embeddings, that is if feature pairs have\nhigh interaction weights in the latent space, then feature embeddings with no\nobserved interactions across the domains will be closely related as well. We\nformulate our objective function as a ranking problem in factorization machines\nand learn the model's parameters via gradient descent. In addition, to better\ncapture the non-linearity in user preferences across domains we extend the\nproposed CDT model by using a deep learning strategy, namely DeepCDT. Our\nexperiments on six publicly available cross-domain tasks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed models, outperforming other state-of-the-art\ncross-domain strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 2019 15:23:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

Both\nvehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications\nwill be needed to reliably disseminate information in a vehicular network. In\nthis regard, a roadside unit (RSU) equipped with multiple antennas can improve\nthe network capacity. While the traditional approaches assume antennas to\nexperience independent fading, we consider a more practical uplink scenario\nwhere antennas at the RSU experience correlated fading. In particular, we\nevaluate the packet error probability for two renowned antenna correlation\nmodels, i.e., constant correlation (CC) and exponential correlation (EC). We\nalso consider intermediate cooperative vehicles for reliable communication\nbetween the source vehicle and the RSU. Here, we derive closed-form expressions\nfor packet error probability which help quantify the performance variations due\nto fading parameter, correlation coefficients and the number of intermediate\nhelper vehicles. To evaluate the optimal transmit power in this network\nscenario, we formulate a Stackelberg game, wherein, the source vehicle is\ntreated as a buyer and the helper vehicles are the sellers. The optimal\nsolutions for the asking price and the transmit power are devised which\nmaximize the utility functions of helper vehicles and the source vehicle,\nrespectively. We verify our mathematical derivations by extensive simulations\nin MATLAB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 2019 11:15:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

Despite its sustainability, end-to-end delay in an MEHWN could be\nvery large, due to the large waiting delay on each hop in the network. In this\nwork, we consider an MEHWN where every node constantly switches between on and\noff states, due to the limited amount of harvested energy. The network delay of\nan MEHWN is not well understood because of the energy uncertainty,\nasynchronized working schedules, and complex network topology in an MEHWN. To\nclose this research gap, we define the relative network delay as the ratio\nbetween end-to-end delay and distance. Compared to previous works, we are able\nto identify a closed-form expression of the lower bound and a tighter upper\nbound of the relative network delay. The theoretical findings are verified in\nsimulations. Our theoretical analysis deepens the understanding about the\ninterplay of network delay, energy harvesting rate, and node density in an\nMEHWN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Aug 2019 23:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

For classification, we progressively train a\nclassifier generative adversarial network on the characters from low to high\nresolution.

This notion is inspired by an observation in the decoding\nprocess of deep image matting where indices-guided unpooling can often recover\nboundary details considerably better than other upsampling operators such as\nbilinear interpolation. By viewing the indices as a function of the feature\nmap, we introduce the concept of \"learning to index\", and present a novel\nindex-guided encoder-decoder framework where indices are self-learned\nadaptively from data and are used to guide the downsampling and upsampling\nstages, without extra training supervision. At the core of this framework is a\nnew learnable module, termed Index Network (IndexNet), which dynamically\ngenerates indices conditioned on the feature map itself. IndexNet can be used\nas a plug-in applying to almost all off-the-shelf convolutional networks that\nhave coupled downsampling and upsampling stages, giving the networks the\nability to dynamically capture variations of local patterns. In particular, we\ninstantiate and investigate five families of IndexNet and demonstrate their\neffectiveness on four dense prediction tasks, including image denoising, image\nmatting, semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation.
