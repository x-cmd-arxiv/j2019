Three important channel\nmodeling components, spatial consistency, human blockage, and outdoor-to-indoor\npenetration loss, were proposed in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project\nRelease 14 for mmWave communication system design. This paper presents NYUSIM\n2.0, an improved channel simulator which can simulate spatially consistent\nchannel realizations based on the existing drop-based channel simulator NYUSIM\n1.6.1. A geometry-based approach using multiple reflection surfaces is proposed\nto generate spatially correlated and time-variant channel coefficients. Using\nresults from 73 GHz pedestrian measurements for human blockage, a four-state\nMarkov model has been implemented in NYUSIM to simulate dynamic human blockage\nshadowing loss. To model the excess path loss due to penetration into\nbuildings, a parabolic model for outdoor-to-indoor penetration loss has been\nadopted from the 5G Channel Modeling special interest group and implemented in\nNYUSIM 2.0. This paper demonstrates how these new modeling capabilities\nreproduce realistic data when implemented in Monte Carlo fashion using NYUSIM\n2.0, making it a valuable measurement-based channel simulator for\nfifth-generation and beyond mmWave communication system design and evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 16:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

Galaxies with high [O III]/[O II] have higher H-alpha\nequivalent widths (EWs), and high intrinsic Ly-alpha production may explain the\nprevalence of high Ly-alpha EWs among GPs. While Ly-alpha escape fraction is\nclosely linked to low gas covering fractions, implying a clumpy gas geometry,\nnarrow Ly-alpha velocity peak separation (delta_v,LyA) correlates with the\nionization state, suggesting a density-bounded geometry. We therefore suggest\nthat delta_v,LyA may trace the residual transparency of low-column-density\npathways. Metallicity is associated with both [O III]/[O II] and delta_v,LyA.\nThis trend may result from catastrophic cooling around low-metallicity star\nclusters, which generates a compact geometry of dense clouds within a\nlow-density inter-clump medium. We find that the relative strength of\nlow-ionization UV emission to absorption correlates with Ly-alpha emission\nstrength and is related to Ly-alpha profile shape.

The strengths of the\nlow-ionization absorption and emission lines in a stacked spectrum do not\ncorrespond to any individual spectrum.

Conventional approaches\neither manually design or use neural architecture search (NAS) to find a\nspecialized neural network and train it from scratch for each case, which is\ncomputationally prohibitive (causing $CO_2$ emission as much as 5 cars'\nlifetime) thus unscalable. In this work, we propose to train a once-for-all\n(OFA) network that supports diverse architectural settings by decoupling\ntraining and search, to reduce the cost. We can quickly get a specialized\nsub-network by selecting from the OFA network without additional training. To\nefficiently train OFA networks, we also propose a novel progressive shrinking\nalgorithm, a generalized pruning method that reduces the model size across many\nmore dimensions than pruning (depth, width, kernel size, and resolution). It\ncan obtain a surprisingly large number of sub-networks ($> 10^{19}$) that can\nfit different hardware platforms and latency constraints while maintaining the\nsame level of accuracy as training independently.

This is at the\nheart of the so called $\\eta$-problem in inflation, since large contributions\nto the masses of the inflatons might spoil the slow-roll conditions required\nfor inflation. We show that, while this is an unavoidable conclusion in single\nfield inflation, in multifield inflation, heavy fields as defined above, may be\nfully responsible for a successful period of what we call fat slow-roll\ninflation. Moreover we show that in this scenario, the turning rate of the\ninflationary trajectory, $\\Omega/H$, is larger than one. Thus, the\n$\\eta$-problem is evaded with large turns in fat inflation. Depending on the\nperturbations' mass spectra, cosmological predictions will differ either\nslightly or largely with respect to those of the single field case. We\nillustrate this scenario in a concrete example in Type IIB string flux\ncompactifications, where a probe D5-brane moving along the angular and radial\ndirections in a warped throat drives fat D5-brane natural inflation. An\ninstantaneous superplanckian decay constant can be defined, consistent with our\nlow energy approximations, thanks to the strong warping of the geometry.

The dramatic\nprogress made by modern probe techniques to uncover the microscopic structure\nof matter is fundamentally rooted in our control of two defining traits of\nquantum mechanics: discreteness of physical properties and interference\nphenomena. Magnetic Resonance Imaging, for instance, exploits the fact that\nprotons have spin and can absorb photons at frequencies that depend on the\nmedium to image the anatomy and physiology of living systems. Scattering\ntechniques, in which photons, electrons, protons or neutrons are used as\nprobes, make use of quantum interference to directly image the spatial position\nof individual atoms, their magnetic structure, or even unveil their concomitant\ndynamical correlations. None of these probes have so far exploited a unique\ncharacteristic of the quantum world: entanglement. Here we introduce a\nfundamentally new quantum probe, an entangled neutron beam, where individual\nneutrons can be entangled in spin, trajectory and energy. Its tunable\nentanglement length from nanometers to microns and energy differences from peV\nto neV will enable new investigations of microscopic magnetic correlations in\nsystems with strongly entangled phases, such as those believed to emerge in\nunconventional superconductors. We develop an interferometer to prove\nentanglement of these distinguishable properties of the neutron beam by\nobserving clear violations of both Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt and Mermin\ncontextuality inequalities in the same experimental setup.

Using prescribed gas density\nand magnetic field distributions, wind profiles, CR injection rates, and\nstellar radiation fields, we simultaneously fit both the integrated gamma-ray\nemission and the spatially-resolved multi-frequency radio emission extended\nalong M82's minor axis.

In order to form chondrules,\nchondrule precursors must be heated to temperatures much higher than the\ntypical conditions in the current asteroid belt. One proposed mechanism for\nchondrule heating is the passage through bow shocks of highly eccentric\nplanetesimals in the protoplanetary disk in the early solar system. However, it\nis difficult for planetesimals to gain and maintain such high eccentricities.\nIn this paper, we present a new scenario in which planetesimals in the asteroid\nbelt region are excited to high eccentricities by the Jovian sweeping secular\nresonance in a depleting disk, leading to efficient formation of chondrules. We\nstudy the orbital evolution of planetesimals in the disk using semi-analytic\nmodels and numerical simulations. We investigate the dependence of eccentricity\nexcitation on the planetesimal's size as well as the physical environment, and\ncalculate the probability for chondrule formation. We find that 50 - 2000 km\nplanetesimals can obtain eccentricities larger than 0.6 and cause effective\nchondrule heating. Most chondrules form in high velocity shocks, in low density\ngas, and in the inner disk. The fraction of chondrule precursors which become\nchondrules is about 4 - 9 % between 1.5 - 3 AU. Our model implies that the disk\ndepletion timescale is $\\tau_\\mathrm{dep}\\approx 1~\\mathrm{Myr}$, comparable to\nthe age spread of chondrules; and that Jupiter formed before chondrules, no\nmore than 0.7 Myr after the formation of the CAIs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

In this work we begin a systematic exploration into truly\nnatural models of dark matter, organized by only relativity and quantum\nmechanics, without the appeal to any additional global symmetries, no\nfine-tuning, and no small parameters.

Empirical estimates of the importance of trait-matching for determining\nspecies interactions, however, vary significantly among different types of\necological networks. Here, we show that ambiguity among empirical\ntrait-matching studies may have arisen at least in parts from using overly\nsimple statistical models. Using simulated and real data, we contrast\nconventional generalized linear models (GLM) with more flexible Machine\nLearning (ML) models (Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, Deep Neural\nNetworks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, naive Bayes,\nand k-Nearest-Neighbor), testing their ability to predict species interactions\nbased on traits, and infer trait combinations causally responsible for species\ninteractions. We find that the best ML models can successfully predict species\ninteractions in plant-pollinator networks, outperforming GLMs by a substantial\nmargin.

We conclude that flexible ML models offer many advantages over\ntraditional regression models for understanding interaction networks.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a comprehensive framework for crosstalk errors and a protocol for\ndetecting and localizing them.

This paper provides a general discussion of design\nprinciples for introducing fractures in simulators, and defines a framework for\nintegrated modeling, discretization and computer implementation. The framework\nis implemented in the simulation software PorePy, which can serve as a flexible\nprototyping tool or multiphysics problems in fractured rocks. Based on a\nrepresentation of the fractures and their intersections as lower-dimensional\nobjects, we discuss data structures for mixed-dimensional meshes, formulation\nof multiphysics problems and discretizations that utilize existing software. We\nfurther present the implementation of these concepts in the PorePy open-source\nsoftware tool, which is aimed at coupled simulation of flow and transport in\nthree-dimensional fractured reservoirs as well as deformation of fractures and\nthe reservoir in general. We present validation by benchmarks for flow,\nporoelasticity and fracture deformation in fractured porous media.

Aggregated Relational Data (ARD), which capture information about a\nsocial network by asking a respondent questions of the form ``How many people\nwith trait X do you know?'' provide a low-cost option when collecting complete\nnetwork data is not possible. Rather than asking about connections between each\npair of individuals directly, ARD collects the number of contacts the\nrespondent knows with a given trait. Despite widespread use and a growing\nliterature on ARD methodology, there is still no systematic understanding of\nwhen and why ARD should accurately recover features of the unobserved network.\nThis paper provides such a characterization by deriving conditions under which\nstatistics about the unobserved network (or functions of these statistics like\nregression coefficients) can be consistently estimated using ARD. We do this by\nfirst providing consistent estimates of network model parameters for three\ncommonly used probabilistic models: the beta-model with node-specific\nunobserved effects, the stochastic block model with unobserved community\nstructure, and latent geometric space models with unobserved latent locations.\nA key observation behind these results is that cross-group link probabilities\nfor a collection of (possibly unobserved) groups identifies the model\nparameters, meaning ARD is sufficient for parameter estimation. With these\nestimated parameters, it is possible to simulate graphs from the fitted\ndistribution and analyze the distribution of network statistics. We can then\ncharacterize conditions under which the simulated networks based on ARD will\nallow for consistent estimation of the unobserved network statistics, such as\neigenvector centrality or response functions by or of the unobserved network,\nsuch as regression coefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 19:04:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Oct 2021 22:04:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 18:15:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 05:55:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-24"}

The low field melting is accompanied by a significant\nchange in local magnetization ~ 3 G, which decreases with increasing applied\nfield. The observed vortex melting phenomena is traced on a field temperature\nphase diagram and which lies very close to theoretically predicted Lindemann\ncriteria based low field melting line. Our analysis shows a Lindemann number cL\n= 0.14 associated with the low field melting.

For this reason, it has been suggested to model malware spread\nusing epidemiological models developed to characterize the spread of biological\npathogens. However, most work examining the similarities between malware and\npathogens using such methods was based on theoretical analysis and simulation.\n  Here we extend the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)\nepidemiological model to describe two of the most common infection methods used\nby malware. We fit the proposed model to malware collected over a period of one\nyear from a major anti-malware vendor. We show that by fitting the proposed\nmodel it is possible to identify the method of transmission used by the\nmalware, its rate of infection, and the number of machines which will be\ninfected unless blocked by anti-virus software. The Spearman correlation\nbetween the number of actual and predicted infected machines is 0.84.\n  Examining cases where an anti-malware \"signature\" was transmitted to\nsusceptible computers by the anti-virus provider, we show that the time to\nremove the malware will be short and independent of the number of infected\ncomputers if fewer than approximately 60% of susceptible computers have been\ninfected. If more computers were infected, the time to removal will be\napproximately 3.2 greater, and will depend on the fraction of infected\ncomputers.\n  Our results show that the application of epidemiological models of infection\nto malware can provide anti-virus providers with information on malware spread\nand its potential damage.

However, under some circumstances, these biological systems may\nexperience instantaneous and periodic perturbations (e.g. harvest, birth,\nrelease, fire events, etc) such that an appropriate formalism is necessary,\nusing, for instance, impulsive reaction-diffusion equations. While several\nworks tackled the issue of traveling waves for monotone reaction-diffusion\nequations and the computation of spreading speeds, very little has been done in\nthe case of monotone impulsive reaction-diffusion equations. Based on\nvector-valued recursion equations theory, we aim to present in this paper\nresults that address two main issues of monotone impulsive reaction-diffusion\nequations. First, they deal with the existence of traveling waves for monotone\nsystems of impulsive reaction-diffusion equations. Second, they allow the\ncomputation of spreading speeds for monotone systems of impulsive\nreaction-diffusion equations. We apply our methodology to a planar system of\nimpulsive reaction-diffusion equations that models tree-grass interactions in\nfire-prone savannas. Numerical simulations, including numerical approximations\nof spreading speeds, are finally provided in order to illustrate our\ntheoretical results and support the discussion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 20:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

Drones often come in various sizes and are designed for a multitude of\npurposes. Nowadays many people have small-sized personal drones for\nentertainment, filming, or transporting items from one place to another.\nHowever, personal drones lack a privacy-preserving mechanism. While in mission,\ndrones often trespass into the personal territories of other people and capture\nphotos or videos through windows without their knowledge and consent. They may\nalso capture video or pictures of people walking, sitting, or doing private\nthings within the drones' reach in clear form without their go permission. This\ncould potentially invade people's personal privacy.

It is a fast window object detection and scrambling technology\nbuilt based on image-enhancing, morphological transformation, segmentation and\ncontouring processes (MASP). Besides, a chaotic scrambling technique is\nincorporated into it for privacy purpose. Hence, this mechanism detects window\nobjects in every image or frame of a real-time video and masks them chaotically\nto protect the privacy of people.

The setup is\nstrongly related to a DC pension plan where additionally (individual)\nconsumption is taken into account. The consumption rate is subject to a\ntime-varying minimum level and terminal wealth is subject to a terminal floor.\nMoreover, the preference between consumption and terminal wealth as well as the\nintertemporal coefficient of risk aversion are time-varying and therefore\ndepend on the age of the considered pension cohort. The optimal consumption and\ninvestment policies are calculated in the case of a Black-Scholes financial\nmarket framework and hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) utility\nfunctions. We generalize Ye (2008) (2008 American Control Conference, 356-362)\nby adding an age-dependent coefficient of risk aversion and extend Steffensen\n(2011) (Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 35(5), 659-667), Hentschel\n(2016) (Doctoral dissertation, Ulm University) and Aase (2017) (Stochastics,\n89(1), 115-141) by considering consumption in combination with terminal wealth\nand allowing for consumption and terminal wealth floors via an application of\nHARA utility functions. A case study on fitting several models to realistic,\ntime-dependent life-cycle consumption and relative investment profiles shows\nthat only our extended model with time-varying preference parameters provides\nsufficient flexibility for an adequate fit. This is of particular interest to\nlife-cycle products for (private) pension investments or pension insurance in\ngeneral.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 01:17:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-03"}

XRPIX is a monolithic active\npixel sensor consisting of a high-resistivity Si sensor, thin SiO$_2$\ninsulator, and CMOS pixel circuits that utilize SOI technology. Since XRPIX is\ncapable of event-driven readouts, it can achieve high timing resolution greater\nthan $\\sim 10{\\rm ~\\mu s}$, which enables low background observation by\nadopting the anti-coincidence technique. One of the major issues in the\ndevelopment of XRPIX is the electrical interference between the sensor layer\nand circuit layer, which causes nonuniform detection efficiency at the pixel\nboundaries. In order to reduce the interference, we introduce a Double-SOI\n(D-SOI) structure, in which a thin Si layer (middle Si) is added to the\ninsulator layer of the SOI structure.

The hashtags, that a user\nprovides to a post (e.g., a micro-video), are the ones which in her mind can\nwell describe the post content where she is interested in. It means that we\nshould consider both users' preferences on the post contents and their personal\nunderstanding on the hashtags. Most existing methods rely on modeling either\nthe interactions between hashtags and posts or the interactions between users\nand hashtags for hashtag recommendation. These methods have not well explored\nthe complicated interactions among users, hashtags, and micro-videos. In this\npaper, towards the personalized micro-video hashtag recommendation, we propose\na Graph Convolution Network based Personalized Hashtag Recommendation (GCN-PHR)\nmodel, which leverages recently advanced GCN techniques to model the complicate\ninteractions among <users, hashtags, micro-videos> and learn their\nrepresentations. In our model, the users, hashtags, and micro-videos are three\ntypes of nodes in a graph and they are linked based on their direct\nassociations. In particular, the message-passing strategy is used to learn the\nrepresentation of a node (e.g., user) by aggregating the message passed from\nthe directly linked other types of nodes (e.g., hashtag and micro-video).\nBecause a user is often only interested in certain parts of a micro-video and a\nhashtag is typically used to describe the part (of a micro-video) that the user\nis interested in, we leverage the attention mechanism to filter the message\npassed from micro-videos to users and hashtags, which can significantly improve\nthe representation capability. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two\nreal-world micro-video datasets and demonstrate that our model outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art approaches by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 02:14:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

Most existing work in activity recognition pay more attention\nto design efficient architecture or video sampling strategy. However, due to\nthe property of fine-grained action and long term structure in video, activity\nrecognition is expected to reason temporal relation between video sequences. In\nthis paper, we propose an efficient temporal reasoning graph (TRG) to\nsimultaneously capture the appearance features and temporal relation between\nvideo sequences at multiple time scales. Specifically, we construct learnable\ntemporal relation graphs to explore temporal relation on the multi-scale range.\nAdditionally, to facilitate multi-scale temporal relation extraction, we design\na multi-head temporal adjacent matrix to represent multi-kinds of temporal\nrelations. Eventually, a multi-head temporal relation aggregator is proposed to\nextract the semantic meaning of those features convolving through the graphs.\nExtensive experiments are performed on widely-used large-scale datasets, such\nas Something-Something and Charades, and the results show that our model can\nachieve state-of-the-art performance.

A spinning B-WD could\nalso be an ideal source for continuous gravitational radiation and soft\ngamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs). SGRs/AXPs are\ngenerally believed to be highly magnetized, but observationally not confirmed\nyet, neutron stars. Invoking B-WDs does not require the magnetic field to be as\nhigh as for neutron star based model, however reproducing other observed\nproperties intact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 06:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

It plays an important role in model regularization, semi-supervised\nlearning and domain adaption. However, despite its empirical success, its\ndeficiency of randomly mixing samples has poorly been studied. Since deep\nnetworks are capable of memorizing the entire dataset, the corrupted samples\ngenerated by vanilla MixUp with a badly chosen interpolation policy will\ndegrade the performance of networks. To overcome the underfitting by corrupted\nsamples, inspired by Meta-learning (learning to learn), we propose a novel\ntechnique of learning to mixup in this work, namely, MetaMixUp.

A major\nshare of that reduction needs to be covered by the heat sector, which accounts\nfor ~35% of the energy based emissions in Germany. Biomass is the renewable key\nplayer in the heterogeneous heat sector today. Its properties such as weather\nindependency, simple storage and flexible utilization open up a wide field of\napplications for biomass. However, in a future heat sector fulfilling GHG\nreduction targets and energy sectors being increasingly connected: which\nbioenergy technology concepts are competitive options against other renewable\nheating systems? In this paper, the cost optimal allocation of the limited\nGerman biomass potential is investigated under longterm scenarios using a\nmathematical optimization approach. The model results show that bioenergy can\nbe a competitive option in the future. Especially the use of biomass from\nresidues can be highly competitive in hybrid combined heat and power (CHP)\npellet combustion plants in the private household sector.

We construct a novel gated fusion network,\nwith one particularly designed cross-gating (CG) block, to effectively encode\nand fuse different types of representations, e.g., the motion and content\nfeatures of an input video. One POS sequence generator relies on this fused\nrepresentation to predict the global syntactic structure, which is thereafter\nleveraged to guide the video captioning generation and control the syntax of\nthe generated sentence. Specifically, a gating strategy is proposed to\ndynamically and adaptively incorporate the global syntactic POS information\ninto the decoder for generating each word. Experimental results on two\nbenchmark datasets, namely MSR-VTT and MSVD, demonstrate that the proposed\nmodel can well exploit complementary information from multiple representations,\nresulting in improved performances.

Earlier studies suggested that velocity superstructures were smaller\nthan their thermal counterparts in the center of the domain. However, a\nscale-by-scale analysis of the correlation between the two fields employing the\nlinear coherence spectrum reveals that superstructures of the same size exist\nin both fields, which are almost perfectly correlated. The issue is further\nclarified by the observation that in contrast to the temperature, and unlike\nassumed previously, superstructures in the vertical velocity field do not\nresult in a peak in the power spectrum of $w$. The origin of this difference is\ntraced back to the production terms of the $\\theta$- and $w$-variance. These\nresults are confirmed for a range of Rayleigh numbers $Ra = 10^5$--$10^9$, the\nsuperstructure size is seen to increase monotonically with $Ra$. Furthermore,\nthe scale distribution of particularly the temperature fluctuations is\npronouncedly bimodal.

However, few existing LF-IQA\nmethods concentrate on effects caused by angular inconsistency. Especially,\nno-reference methods lack effective utilization of 2-D angular information. In\nthis paper, we focus on measuring the 2-D angular consistency for LF-IQA. The\nMicro-Lens Image (MLI) refers to the angular domain of the LF image, which can\nsimultaneously record the angular information in both horizontal and vertical\ndirections. Since the MLI contains 2-D angular information, we propose a\nNo-Reference Light Field image Quality assessment model based on MLI (LF-QMLI).\nSpecifically, we first utilize Global Entropy Distribution (GED) and Uniform\nLocal Binary Pattern descriptor (ULBP) to extract features from the MLI, and\nthen pool them together to measure angular consistency.

This choice of regime has important\nimplications for cortical functional responses, as we describe: loose balance,\nbut not tight balance, can yield many nonlinear population behaviors seen in\nsensory cortical neurons, allow the presence of correlated variability, and\nyield decrease of that variability with increasing external stimulus drive as\nobserved across multiple cortical areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 09:29:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 09:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-29"}

For\neach of the homogenous and heterogenous model ensembles, the study investigates\nthe performance of three model ensembling approaches: linear averaging\n(non-weighted), ranked weighted averaging and model stacking using artificial\nneural networks. Using the approach of 'over-produce then select', the study\nused 17 years of data on 16 selected variables for predictive drought\nmonitoring to build 244 individual ANN and SVR models from which 111 models\nwere selected for the building of the model ensembles.

Heavy-duty\nvehicles (HDV) emit a large share of GHG emissions in the transport sector and\nare therefore the subject of growing attention from global regulators. Fuel\ncell and green hydrogen technologies are a promising option to decarbonize\nHDVs, as their fast refueling and long vehicle ranges are in line with current\nlogistic operation concepts. Moreover, the application of green hydrogen in\ntransport could enable more effective integration of renewable energies (RE)\nacross different energy sectors. This paper explores the interplay between HDV\nHydrogen Refueling Stations (HRS) that produce hydrogen locally and the power\nsystem by combining an infrastructure location planning model and an energy\nsystem optimization model that takes grid expansion options into account. Two\nscenarios - one sizing refueling stations in symbiosis with the power system\nand one sizing them independently of it - are assessed regarding their impacts\non the total annual energy system costs, regional RE integration and the\nlevelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). The impacts are calculated based on\nlocational marginal pricing for 2050. Depending on the integration scenario, we\nfind average LCOH of between 5.66 euro/kg and 6.20 euro/kg, for which nodal\nelectricity prices are the main determining factor as well as a strong\ndifference in LCOH between north and south Germany. From a system perspective,\ninvesting in HDV-HRS in symbiosis with the power system rather than\nindependently promises cost savings of around one billion-euros per annum. We\ntherefore conclude that the co-optimization of multiple energy sectors is\nimportant for investment planning and has the potential to exploit synergies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 10:26:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-25"}

Such a trajectory has its influence on the\nnon-thermal emission of the jets, which also depends strongly on the observing\nangle due to Doppler boosting effects. We explore how the expected non-thermal\nemission of HMMQ jets at small scales is affected by the impact of the stellar\nwind and the orbital motion on the jet propagation. We studied the broadband\nnon-thermal emission, from radio to gamma rays, produced in HMMQ jets up to a\ndistance of several orbital separations, taking into account a realistic jet\ntrajectory, different model parameters, and orbital modulation. The jet\ntrajectory is computed by considering momentum transfer with the stellar wind.\nElectrons are injected at the position where a recollimation shock in the jets\nis expected due to the wind impact. Their distribution along the jet path is\nobtained assuming local acceleration at the recollimation shock, and cooling\nvia adiabatic, synchrotron, and inverse Compton processes. The synchrotron and\ninverse Compton emission is calculated taking into account synchrotron\nself-absorption within the jet, free-free absorption with the stellar wind, and\nabsorption by stellar photons via pair production. Asymmetric light curves are\nobtained owing to the helical trajectory of the jets.

A graphical user interface enables to control the\nbioimpedance excitation current in a range from 100 {\\mu}A to 1 mA in a\nfrequency range from 50 kHz to 333 kHz. Results: A system characterization\ndemonstrated that bioimpedance magnitude changes of less than 250 ppm and phase\nchanges below 0.05{\\deg} can be detected reliably. Measurements from a subject\nhave shown the timing relationship between EMG and bioimpedance signals as well\nas their robustness against mechanical disturbances. A measurement of five\nexemplary hand gestures has demonstrated the increase of usable information for\ndetecting muscle contractions. Conclusion: Bioimpedance measurements of muscles\nprovide useful information about contractions. Furthermore, the usage of a\nknown high-frequency excitation current enables a reliable differentiation\nbetween the actual information and disturbances. Significance: By combining EMG\nand bioimpedance measurements, muscle contractions can be detected much more\nreliably. This setup can be adopted to prostheses and many other human-computer\ninterfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 11:24:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

The uncertainties on the diffractive PDFs are calculated\nusing the standard \"Hessian error propagation\" which served to provide a more\nrealistic estimate of the uncertainties. This analysis are enriched, for the\nfirst time, by including the nonperturbative higher twist (HT) effects in the\ncalculation of diffractive DIS cross sections which are particularly important\nat large-$x$ and low $Q^{2}$ regions. Then, the stability and reliability of\nthe extracted diffractive PDFs are investigated upon inclusion of HT effects.\nWe discuss the novel aspects of the approach used in this QCD fit, namely,\noptimized and flexible parameterizations of diffractive PDFs, the inclusion of\nHT effects, and considering the recent H1/ZEUS combined dataset. Finally, we\npresent the extracted diffractive PDFs with and without the presence of HT\neffects, and discuss the fit quality and the stability upon variations of the\nkinematic cuts and the fitted datasets. We show that the inclusion of HT\neffects in diffractive DIS can improve the description of the data which leads,\nin general, to a very good agreement between data and theory predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 12:15:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 2019 07:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-20"}

In particular, a robust Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)\nscheme is presented for the case of underactuated Autonomous Underwater\nVehicles (AUVs) (i.e., vehicles actuated only in surge, heave and yaw). The\npurpose of the controller is to steer the underactuated AUV to a desired\ntrajectory with guaranteed input and state constraints within a partially known\nand dynamic environment where the knowledge of the operating workspace is\nconstantly updated on-line via the vehicle's on-board sensors. In particular,\nby considering a ball that covers the volume of the system, obstacle avoidance\nwith any of the detected obstacles is guaranteed, despite the model dynamic\nuncertainties and the presence of external disturbances representing ocean\ncurrents and waves.

Here, the\ngeometrical confinement leads to entropic barriers which effectively control\nthe transport properties of the particles. We show that compared to no-flow\nboundary conditions, the transport properties exhibit distinct features in a\nchannel with reflection boundary conditions. For example, the nonlinear\nmobility exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior as a function of the scaling\nparameter $f$, which is a ratio of the work done to the particles to available\nthermal energy. Also, the effective diffusion exhibits a rapidly increasing\nbehavior at higher $f$. The nature of reflection, i.e., elastic or inelastic,\nalso influences the transport properties firmly. We find that inelastic\nreflections increase both the mobility and the effective diffusion for smaller\n$f$. In addition, by including the short range interaction force between the\nBrownian particles, the mobility decreases and the effective diffusion\nincreases for various values of $f$. These findings, which are a signature of\nthe entropic nature of the system, can be useful to understand the transport of\nsmall particles or molecules in systems such as microfluidic channels, membrane\npores, and molecular sieves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 13:33:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

Compared with existing $l_1$ norm regularized\ntensor decomposition methods, our algorithm can exactly recover the values of\nuncorrupted fibers of a low rank tensor and find the positions of corrupted\nfibers under mild conditions. Numerical experiments illustrate that our\nalgorithm can exactly detect outliers even with missing data rates as high as\n40%, conditioned on the outlier corruption rate and the Tucker rank of the low\nrank tensor. Finally, we apply our method on a real traffic dataset\ncorresponding to downtown Nashville, TN, USA and successfully detect the events\nlike severe car crashes, construction lane closures, and other large events\nthat cause significant traffic disruptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 13:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

We study\nthe effect of dynamical friction against DM minispike on the evolution of\neccentric IMRI. For such investigation we construct the dynamical equations\nwhich describes the evolution of eccentric IMRI under the effect of dynamical\nfriction. As dynamical friction is large for small velocity, the dissipation of\nenergy near apastron is more than that near periastron. This will greatly\nenhance the eccentricity. For instance, with an initial semi-latus rectum of\n$1\\rm AU$, even a moderate DM minispike can make the eccentricity grow from\n$0.3$ to $0.85$. In the extremal case the eccentricity could be enhanced to\nnear $1$. We also study a specific case which corresponds to an IMRI in the\ncenter of a globular cluster (GC) and find the eccentricity can keep its value\nabove $0.95$ until the IMRI enters LISA band. These gravitational wave with\nenhanced eccentricity by DM minispikes can be easly distinguished from that\nwithout DM at $10^{-3}\\rm Hz$ due to the eccentricity difference.

The\nHaumea family members larger than approximately 20 km in diameter must be\ncharacterized by a shallow H-distribution slope in order to produce only these\nthree large detections. This shallow size distribution suggests that the family\nformed in a graze-and-merge scenario, not a catastrophic collision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 15:46:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

CO\nis one of the most dangerous gases in the atmosphere, as it binds to the\nhemoglobin in blood cells 200 times easier than O2. As the amount of CO in the\nblood stream increases, the level of oxygen decreases, which can lead to many\nneurological problems. To reduce the amount of CO in the atmosphere, scientists\nhave focused on the adsorption of oxygen. The best substrates used today are\nplatinum and palladium monolayers, which are very expensive. Because of this,\nresearchers have searched for cheap materials, such as MoS2, that are able to\nadsorb oxygen. However, sulfur is a chemically inert site for the oxygen, which\ngreatly decreases the catalytic potential of monolayer MoS2 sheets. Therefore,\nwe carried out first-principles calculations to study the effect of\nsubstitutional doping and creating sulfur vacancies on the catalytic properties\nof MoS2. We calculated the adsorption energy of O on doped MoS2 sheets with\nvacancies, and compared it to the adsorption energy of O on a Pd monolayer. We\nfound that doping MoS2 with Ir, Rh, Co and Fe significantly decreased the\nadsorption energy, to below -4 eV, indicating that doped MoS2 is a more\neffective catalyst than Pd. Incorporating sulfur vacancies into the doped MoS2\nsheet was extremely effective, and decreased the adsorption energy below -6 eV.\nOur results show that iridium is the best catalyst as it has the lowest\nadsorption energy before and after sulfur vacancies were induced. We concluded\nthat a combination of doping and creating vacancies in monolayer MoS2 sheets\ncan greatly impact the catalytic behavior and make it a more effective, less\nexpensive catalyst than Pt and Pd.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 17:02:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Creating such smooth color variations through scattering by the\nstructural patterning of a surface, as opposed to color pigments, has long\nremained a challenge. Here, we borrow from the painter's approach and\ndemonstrate color mixing generated by an optical metasurface. We propose a\nsingle-layer plasmonic color pixel and a method for nanophotonic structural\ncolor mixing based on the additive RGB color model. The color pixels consist of\nplasmonic nanorod arrays that generate vivid primary colors and enable\nindependent control of color brightness without affecting chromaticity, by\nsimply varying geometric in-plane parameters. By interleaving different nanorod\narrays, we combine up to three primary colors on a single pixel. Based on this,\ntwo and three color mixing is demonstrated, enabling the continuous coverage of\na plasmonic RGB color gamut and yielding a palette with a virtually unlimited\nnumber of colors. With this multi-resonant color pixel, we show the\nphotorealistic printing of color and monochrome images at the nanoscale, with\nultra-smooth transitions in color and brightness.

Using an integral equation for the surface traction\nwe derive the expression for the particles' relative velocity as a sum of the\nBG's velocity and the term due to the presence of a wall at finite distance,\nz_0. Our calculation is not the perturbation theory of the BG solution, so the\ncontribution due to the wall is not necessarily small. The distance at which\nthe wall significantly alters the particles interaction scales as z_0^{3/5}.\nThe phase portrait of the particles' relative motion is different from the BG\ntheory, where there are two singly-connected regions of open and closed\ntrajectories both of infinite volume. For finite z_0, there is a new domain of\nclosed (dancing) and open (swapping) trajectories. The width of this region\nbehaves as 1/z_0. Along the swapping trajectories, that have been previously\nobserved numerically, the incoming particle is turning back after the encounter\nwith the reference particle, rather than passing it by, as in the BG theory.\nThe region of dancing trajectories has infinite volume. We found a\none-parameter family of equilibrium states, overlooked previously, whereas the\npair of spheres flows as a whole without changing its configuration. These\nstates are marginally stable and their perturbation yields a two-parameter\nfamily of the dancing trajectories, where the particle is orbiting around a\nfixed point in a frame co-moving with the reference particle. We suggest that\nthe phase portrait obtained at z_0>>a is topologically stable and can be\nextended down to rather small z_0 of several particle diameters.

It enables flexibility in\nnetwork management and control. Energy efficiency is one of the challenging\nglobal problems which has both economic and environmental impact. A massive\namount of information is generated in the controller of an SDN based network.\nMachine learning gives the ability to computers to progressively learn from\ndata without having to write specific instructions. In this work, we propose\nMER-SDN: a machine learning framework for traffic-aware energy efficient\nrouting in SDN. Feature extraction, training, and testing are the three main\nstages of the learning machine. Experiments are conducted on Mininet and POX\ncontroller using real-world network topology and dynamic traffic traces from\nSNDlib. Results show that our approach achieves more than 65\\% feature size\nreduction, more than 70% accuracy in parameter prediction of an energy\nefficient heuristics algorithm, also our prediction refine heuristics converges\nthe predicted value to the optimal parameters values with up to 25X speedup as\ncompared to the brute force method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 14:42:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 09:57:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 2021 04:51:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

It is executed\nhere in a single `monolithic' model which can asymptotically capture both\ndamageable solids (rocks) and (visco-)elastic fluids (outer core or oceans).\nBoth ruptures on pre-existing lithospheric faults and a birth of new faults in\ncompact rocks are covered by this model, together with emission and propagation\nof seismic waves, including, e.g., reflection of S-waves and refraction of\nP-waves on the solid-fluid interfaces. A robust, energy conserving, and\nconvergent staggered FEM discretisation is devised. Using a rather simplified\nvariant of such models for rupture, three computational experiments documenting\nthe applicability of this approach are presented. Some extensions of the model\ntowards more realistic geophysical modelling are outlined, too.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 19:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-19"}
