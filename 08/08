First, a unified\nmodular modeling framework compatible with different types of vehicles is\nproposed with methods to ensure modeling credibility.

In the end, the proposed platform is applied to a multicopter\ncontrol system. By comparing with experimental results, the accuracy and\ncredibility of the simulation testing results are verified by using the\nsimulation credibility assessment method proposed in our previous work.

In this paper, we theoretically investigate how the bagging method\ncan reduce the Mean Squared Error (MSE) when applied on a statistical\nestimator. First, we prove that for any estimator, increasing the number of\nbagged estimators $N$ in the average can only reduce the MSE. This intuitive\nresult, observed empirically and discussed in the literature, has not yet been\nrigorously proved. Second, we focus on the standard estimator of variance\ncalled unbiased sample variance and we develop an exact analytical expression\nof the MSE for this estimator with bagging.\n  This allows us to rigorously discuss the number of iterations $N$ and the\nbatch size $m$ of the bagging method. From this expression, we state that only\nif the kurtosis of the distribution is greater than $\\frac{3}{2}$, the MSE of\nthe variance estimator can be reduced with bagging. This result is important\nbecause it demonstrates that for distribution with low kurtosis, bagging can\nonly deteriorate the performance of a statistical prediction.

The non-thermal Bogoliubov coefficient for a vacuum\nfluctuation near the black hole horizon to produce a particle that crosses the\ncosmological horizon is shown to equal to the convolution of two thermal\ncoefficients, one at the cosmological temperature and one at the black hole\ntemperature, weighted by the transmission coefficient for wave propagation in\nstatic SdS coordinates. In this sense virtual thermal propagation underlies the\nproduction process. This representation leads to the useful result that the\ngeometric optics approximation is reliable when used together with a low\nfrequency cut-off determined by the transmission coefficient.

This ensures that the material they accrete - pebbles,\nas well as (small) planetesimals - will vaporize to enrich their atmospheres.\nEnrichment modifies an envelope's structure and significantly alters its\nfurther evolution. Our aim is to describe the formation of planets with\npolluted envelopes from the moment that impactors begin to sublimate to beyond\nthe disk's eventual dissipation. We constructed an analytical interior\nstructure model, characterized by a hot and uniformly mixed high-Z vapor layer\nsurrounding the core, located below the usual unpolluted radiative-convective\nregions. The evolution of planets with uniformly mixed polluted envelopes\nfollows four potential phases. Initially, the central core grows directly\nthrough impacts and rainout until the envelope becomes hot enough to vaporize\nand absorb all incoming solids. We find that a planet reaches runaway accretion\nwhen the sum of its core and vapor mass exceeds a value that we refer to as the\ncritical metal mass - a criterion that supersedes the traditional critical core\nmass. It scales positively with both the pollutant's evaporation temperature\nand with the planet's core mass. Hence, planets at shorter orbital separations\nrequire the accretion of more solids to reach runaway as they accrete less\nvolatile materials. If the solids accretion rate dries up, we identify the\ndecline of the mean molecular weight - dilution - as a mechanism to limit gas\naccretion during a polluted planet's embedded cooling phase. When the disk\nultimately dissipates, the envelope's inner temperature declines and its vapor\neventually rains out, augmenting the mass of the core. The energy release that\naccompanies this does not result in significant mass-loss, as it only occurs\nafter the planet has substantially contracted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 17:43:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 13:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

Using Gaia DR2 distance estimates, it is now possible to estimate stellar\nages for a larger volume of evolved stars through isochrone matching. This work\npresents [M/H]-age and [$\\alpha$/M]-age relations derived for different spatial\nlocations in the Milky Way disc. These relations are derived by hierarchically\nmodelling the star formation history of stars within a given chemical abundance\nbin. For the first time, we directly observe that significant variation is\napparent in the [M/H]-age relation as a function of both Galactocentric radius\nand distance from the disc mid-plane. The [M/H]-age relations support claims\nthat radial migration has a significant effect in the plane of the disc. Using\nthe [M/H] bin with the youngest mean age at each radial zone in the plane of\nthe disc, the present-day metallicity gradient is measured to be $-0.059 \\pm\n0.010$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, in agreement with Cepheids and young field stars. We\nfind a vertically flared distribution of young stars in the outer disc,\nconfirming predictions of models and previous observations. The mean age of the\n[M/H]-[$\\alpha$/M] distribution of the solar neighborhood suggests that the\nhigh-[M/H] stars are not an evolutionary extension of the low-$\\alpha$\nsequence.

The\nintuition is that the model should focus on important regions of the input\nimage and optimize its capacity allocation conditioning on the crowd intensive\ndegree. ACM-CNN consists of three types of modules: a coarse network, a fine\nnetwork, and a smooth network. The coarse network is used to explore the areas\nthat need to be focused via count attention mechanism, and generate a rough\nfeature map. Then the fine network processes the areas of interest into a fine\nfeature map.

In recent years, narrowband radio\ntechnology has emerged to address this situation: Narrowband Internet of Things\n(NB-IoT), which is now part of 5G. Supporting massive connectivity becomes\nparticularly demanding in extreme coverage scenarios such as underground or\ndeep inside buildings sites. We propose a novel strategy for these situations\nfocused on optimizing NB-IoT shared channels through the selection of link\nparameters: modulation and coding scheme, as well as the number of repetitions.\nThese parameters are established by the base station (BS) for each block\ntransmitted until reaching a target block error rate (BLER_t ). A wrong\nselection of these magnitudes leads to radio resource waste and a decrease in\nthe number of possible concurrent connections. Specifically, our strategy is\nbased on a look-up table (LUT) scheme which is used for rapidly delivering the\noptimal link parameters given a target QoS. To validate our proposal, we\ncompare with alternative strategies using an open source NB-IoT uplink\nsimulator. The experiments are based on transmitting blocks of 256 bits using\nan AWGN channel over the NPUSCH. Results show that, especially under extreme\nconditions, only a few options for link parameters are available, favoring\nrobustness against measurement uncertainties.

In light of this challenge, an active effort is underway to\nintegrate fermionic spins with circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED), which\nwas originally developed in the field of superconducting qubits to achieve\nsingle-shot, quantum-non-demolition (QND) measurements and long-range\ncouplings. However, single-shot readout of an individual spin with cQED has\nremained elusive due to the difficulty of coupling a resonator to a particle\ntrapped by a charge-confining potential.

In our novel implementation, the\nspin is that of an individual superconducting quasiparticle trapped in the\nAndreev levels of a semiconductor nanowire Josephson element. Due to a\nspin-orbit interaction inside the nanowire, this \"superconducting spin\"\ndirectly determines the flow of supercurrent through the element. We harnessed\nthis spin-dependent supercurrent to achieve both a zero-field spin splitting as\nwell as a long-range interaction between the quasiparticle and a\nsuperconducting microwave resonator. Owing to the strength of this interaction\nin our device, measuring the resultant spin-dependent resonator frequency\nyielded QND spin readout with 92% fidelity in 1.9 $\\mu$s and allowed us to\nmonitor the quasiparticle's spin in real time.

Alternatively, the local properties\nof a gauge-invariant state are fully determined by specifying that its\nholonomies in the region are trivial.

This complicates decisions on long-lived\nprojects involving the height of coastal flood protection strategies that seek\nto reduce damages from rising sea levels. If a prescribed margin of safety does\nnot properly account for sea-level rise and its uncertainties, the\neffectiveness of flood protection will decrease over time, potentially putting\nlives and property at greater risk. We develop a flood damage allowance\nframework for calculating the height of a flood protection strategy needed to\nensure that a given level of financial risk is maintained (i.e., the average\nflood damage in a given year). The damage allowance framework considers\ndecision-maker preferences such as planning horizons, preferred protection\nstrategies (storm surge barrier, levee, elevation, and coastal retreat), and\nsubjective views of AIS stability.

Studies have shown\nthat LS brine injection can increase oil production relative to conventional\nhigh-salinity (HS) brine injection, but contradictory results have also been\nreported and an understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains elusive. We\nhave recently developed a steady-state pore network model to simulate oil\nrecovery by LS brine injection in uniformly wetted pore structures (Watson et\nal., Transp. Porous Med. 118, 201-223, 2017). We extend this approach here to\ninvestigate the low-salinity effect (LSE) in heterogeneously wetted media. We\ncouple a model of capillary force-driven fluid displacement to a novel tracer\nalgorithm and track the salinity front in the pore network as oil and HS brine\nare displaced by injected LS brine. The wettability of the pore structure is\nmodified in regions where water salinity falls below a critical threshold, and\nsimulations show that this can have significant consequences for oil recovery.\nFor networks that contain spanning clusters of both water-wet and oil-wet (OW)\npores prior to flooding, our results demonstrate that the OW pores contain the\nonly viable source of incremental oil recovery by LS brine injection. Moreover,\nwe show that a LS-induced increase in microscopic sweep efficiency in the OW\npore fraction is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to guarantee\nadditional oil production. Simulations suggest that the fraction of OW pores in\nthe network, the average network connectivity and the initial HS brine\nsaturation are key factors that can determine the extent of any improvement in\noil recovery in heterogeneously wetted networks following LS brine injection.\nThis study highlights that the mechanisms of the LSE can be markedly different\nin uniformly wetted and non-uniformly wetted porous media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 23:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-09"}

In mature plaques, vascular smooth muscle\ncells (SMCs) are recruited from the adjacent medial layer to deposit a cap of\nfibrous collagen over the fatty plaque core. The fibrous cap isolates the\nthrombogenic content of the plaque from the bloodstream and prevents the\nformation of blood clots that cause myocardial infarction or stroke. Despite\nthe important protective role of the cap, the mechanisms that regulate cap\nformation and maintenance are not well understood. It remains unclear why\ncertain caps become stable, while others become vulnerable to rupture. We\ndevelop a multiphase PDE model with non-standard boundary conditions to\ninvestigate collagen cap formation by SMCs in response to growth factor signals\nfrom the endothelium. Diffusible platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)\nstimulates SMC migration, proliferation and collagen degradation, while\ndiffusible transforming growth factor (TGF)-$\\beta$ stimulates SMC collagen\nsynthesis and inhibits collagen degradation. The model SMCs respond\nhaptotactically to gradients in the collagen phase and have reduced rates of\nmigration and proliferation in dense collagenous tissue. The model, which is\nparameterised using a range of in vivo and in vitro experimental data,\nreproduces several observations from studies of plaque growth in\natherosclerosis-prone mice. Numerical simulations and model analysis\ndemonstrate that a stable cap can be formed by a relatively small SMC\npopulation and emphasise the critical role of TGF-$\\beta$ in effective cap\nformation and maintenance. These findings provide unique insight into the\ncellular and biochemical mechanisms that may lead to plaque destabilisation and\nrupture.

In particular, mode frequencies are observed to increase\nwith increasing activity level.

Thus, the unprecedented long-term\nKepler photometric observations provide a unique opportunity to study stellar\nactivity through asteroseismology. The goal of this work is to investigate the\ndependencies of the observed mode frequency variations on the stellar\nparameters and whether those are consistent with an activity-related origin. We\nselect the solar-type oscillators with highest signal-to-noise ratio, in total\n75 targets. Using the temporal frequency variations determined in Santos et al.\n(2018), we study the relation between those variations and the fundamental\nstellar properties. We also compare the observed frequency shifts with\nchromospheric and photometric activity indexes, which are only available for a\nsubset of the sample. We find that frequency shifts increase with increasing\nchromospheric activity, which is consistent with an activity-related origin of\nthe observed frequency shifts. Frequency shifts are also found to increase with\neffective temperature, which is in agreement with the theoretical predictions\nfor the activity-related frequency shifts by Metcalfe et al. (2007). Frequency\nshifts are largest for fast rotating and young stars, which is consistent with\nthose being more active than slower rotators and older stars. Finally, we find\nevidence for frequency shifts increasing with stellar metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 01:38:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-30"}

The proposed\nplanning method first generates via-points and path primitives around the\ntarget object by using sampling methods based on voxel dilation and\nsubtraction. A novel Primitive Coverage Graph (PCG) is then proposed to encode\nthe topological information, flying distances, and visibility information, with\nthe sampled via-points and path primitives. Finally graph search is performed\nto find the resultant path in the PCG to complete the inspection task with the\ncoverage requirements.

A key\nresearch question in CTOP is how to set traffic flow rates under traffic demand\nand airspace capacity uncertainties. In this paper, we first investigate\nexisting CTOP related stochastic optimization models and point out their roles\nin CTOP flow rate planning, and their advantages and disadvantages in terms of\nmodel flexibility, performance, practicality and Collaborative Decision Making\n(CDM) software compatibility, etc. CTOP FCA rate planning problem has been\nsplit into two steps: traffic flow rate optimization given demand estimation,\nand flow rate adaptation when flight rerouting is considered. Second, we\ndiscuss in detail a class of models called FCA-PCA (Potentially Constrained\nArea) models, which are extended from GDP models to solve the first step of the\nproblem, and were considered promising as they are designed to be consistent\nwith current CTOP software implementation. We will reveal one inherent\nshortcoming suffered by FCA-PCA models and show that how this deficiency can be\naddressed by the PCA model family. We will talk about the problems that prevent\nstochastic programming being optimal in the second step of the problem. Third,\nwe discuss the applicability of simulation-based optimization, combine it with\nstochastic programming based heuristics and test the resulting new model on a\nrealistic use case. The results are very encouraging.

Methods: The U-Net convolutional neural\nnetwork architecture was adapted to learn pixelwise axon count density\nestimates, which were then integrated over the image area to determine axon\ncounts. The tool, termed AxoNet, was trained and evaluated using a dataset\ncontaining images of optic nerve regions randomly selected from complete cross\nsections of intact rat optic nerves and manually annotated for axon count and\nlocation. Both control and damaged optic nerves were used. This rat-trained\nnetwork was then applied to a separate dataset of non-human primate (NHP) optic\nnerve images. AxoNet was then compared to two existing automated axon counting\ntools, AxonMaster and AxonJ, using both datasets. Results: AxoNet outperformed\nthe existing tools on both the rat and NHP optic nerve datasets as judged by\nmean absolute error, R2 values when regressing automated vs. manual counts, and\nBland-Altman analysis. Conclusion: The proposed tool allows for accurate\nquantification of axon numbers as a measure of glaucomatous damage. AxoNet is\nrobust to variations in optic nerve tissue damage extent, image quality, and\nspecies of mammal. Significance: The deep learning method does not rely on\nhand-crafted image features for axon recognition. Therefore, this approach is\nnot species-specific and can be extended to quantify additional optic nerve\nfeatures. It will aid evaluation of optic nerve changes in glaucoma and\npotentially other neurodegenerative diseases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 03:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-07"}

Although randomized ``geo experiments'' are\nfrequently employed for this evaluation, obtaining reliable estimates of iROAS\ncan be challenging as oftentimes only a small number of highly heterogeneous\nunits are used.

This paper addresses\nthis issue by proposing novel image captioning models which use facial\nexpression features to generate image captions.

We compare a\ncomprehensive collection of image captioning models with and without facial\nfeatures using all standard evaluation metrics.

In this review, we address radiation cooling in 2D materials,\nspecifically graphene hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) heterostructures. We\npresent the hyperbolic dispersion of electromagnetic waves due to anisotropy,\nand describe how the spontaneous fluctuations of current in a 2D electronic\nchannel can radiate thermal energy in its hyperbolic surrounding medium.

In a high\nmobility semimetal like graphene at large bias, a steady-state\nout-of-equilibrium situation is caused by the constant Zener tunneling of\nelectrons opening a route for electroluminescence of hyperbolic electromagnetic\nmodes. Experiments reveal that, compared to superPlanckian thermal emission,\nelectroluminescence cooling is particularly prominent once the Zener tunneling\nregime is reached: observed cooling powers are nine orders of magnitude larger\nthan in conventional LEDs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 07:14:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-11"}

This\ntorus has been shown to be unstable to a global non-axisymmetric hydrodynamic\ninstability, the Papaloizou-Pringle instability, in the case where it is not\nalready accreting and has a weak magnetic field. We start by deriving\nanalytical estimates of the maximum amplitude of the gravitational wave signal,\nwith the aim to establish its detectability by the Laser Interferometer Space\nAntenna (LISA). Then, we compare these estimates with those obtained through a\nnumerical simulation of the torus, made with a 3D smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics code. Our numerical analysis shows that the measured strain is\ntwo orders of magnitude lower than the maximum value obtained analytically.\nHowever, accretion discs affected by the Papaloizou-Pringle instability may\nstill be interesting sources for LISA, if we consider discs generated after\ndeeply penetrating tidal disruptions of main sequence stars of higher mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 08:21:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

Extending previous work that focused exclusively on\nphotometry, we simultaneously model the multi-band light curves and optical\nspectra of Type II SNe using RSG progenitors that are characterized by their\nH-rich envelope masses or the mass and extent of an enshrouding cocoon at the\nstar's surface. Reducing the H-rich envelope mass yields faster declining light\ncurves, a shorter duration of the photospheric phase, broader line profiles at\nearly times, but only a modest boost in early-time optical brightness.\nIncreasing the mass of the circumstellar material (CSM) is more effective at\nboosting the early-time brightness and producing a fast-declining light curve\nwhile leaving the duration of the photospheric phase intact. It also makes the\noptical color bluer, delays the onset of recombination, and can severely reduce\nthe speed of the fastest ejecta material. The early ejecta interaction with CSM\nis conducive to producing featureless spectra at $10-20$ d and a weak or absent\nH$\\alpha$ absorption during the recombination phase. The slow decliners SNe\n1999em, 2012aw, and 2004et can be explained with a $1.2 \\times 10^{51}$ erg\nexplosion in a compact ($\\sim$600 R$_\\odot$) RSG star from a 15 M$_\\odot$\nstellar evolution model. A small amount of CSM ($<0.2$ M$_\\odot$) improves the\nmatch to the SN photometry at times $<$ 10 d. With more extended RSG\nprogenitors, one predicts lower ejecta kinetic energies, but the SN color stays\nblue for too long and the spectral line widths are too narrow. The fast\ndecliners SNe 2013ej and 2014G may require $0.5-1.0$ M$_\\odot$ of CSM, although\nthis depends on the CSM structure. A larger boost to the luminosity (as for\nfast decliners SNe 1979C or 1998S) requires interaction with a more spatially\nextended CSM, which might also be detached from the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 08:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

The proposed method named as manifold\nmodeling in embedded space (MMES) is implemented by using a novel\ndenoising-auto-encoder in combination with multi-way delay-embedding transform.\nIn spite of its simplicity, the image/tensor completion, super-resolution,\ndeconvolution, and denoising results of MMES are quite similar even competitive\nto DIP in our extensive experiments, and these results would help us for\nreinterpreting/characterizing the DIP from a perspective of ``low-dimensional\npatch-manifold prior''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 10:05:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 08:14:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

We introduce a definition of\nfidelity to the underlying classifier for local explanation models which is\nbased on distances to a target decision boundary. A system called CLEAR:\nCounterfactual Local Explanations via Regression, is introduced and evaluated.\nCLEAR generates w-counterfactual explanations that state minimum changes\nnecessary to flip a prediction's classification. CLEAR then builds local\nregression models, using the w-counterfactuals to measure and improve the\nfidelity of its regressions. By contrast, the popular LIME method, which also\nuses regression to generate local explanations, neither measures its own\nfidelity nor generates counterfactuals.

The main results of this work are (1) The clock of\nPSR J1939+2134 is stable at the level of almost one part in $10^{15}$ over\nabout $31$ years, (2) the power law index of the spectrum of electron density\nfluctuations in the direction of PSR J1939+2134 is $3.86 \\pm 0.04$, (3) a Moon\nsized planetary companion, in an orbit of semi major axis about $11$\nastronomical units and eccentricity $\\approx 0.2$, can explain the timing noise\nof PSR J1939+2134, (4) Precession under electromagnetic torque with very small\nvalues of oblateness and wobble angle can also be the explanation, but with\nreduced confidence, and (5) there is excess timing noise of about $8$ $\\mu$s\namplitude during the epochs of steepest DM gradient, of unknown cause.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 11:48:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 10:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-10"}

Many rule learning\nalgorithms employ a heuristic-guided search for rules that model regularities\ncontained in the training data and it is commonly accepted that the choice of\nthe heuristic has a significant impact on the predictive performance of the\nlearner. Whereas the properties of rule learning heuristics have been studied\nin the realm of single-label classification, there is no such work taking into\naccount the particularities of multi-label classification. This is surprising,\nas the quality of multi-label predictions is usually assessed in terms of a\nvariety of different, potentially competing, performance measures that cannot\nall be optimized by a single learner at the same time. In this work, we show\nempirically that it is crucial to trade off the consistency and coverage of\nrules differently, depending on which multi-label measure should be optimized\nby a model. Based on these findings, we emphasize the need for configurable\nlearners that can flexibly use different heuristics. As our experiments reveal,\nthe choice of the heuristic is not straight-forward, because a search for rules\nthat optimize a measure locally does usually not result in a model that\nmaximizes that measure globally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 12:13:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

This task is challenging, as the styles of both\nbackground and text need to be preserved so that the edited image is visually\nindistinguishable from the source image. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end\ntrainable style retention network (SRNet) that consists of three modules: text\nconversion module, background inpainting module and fusion module. The text\nconversion module changes the text content of the source image into the target\ntext while keeping the original text style. The background inpainting module\nerases the original text, and fills the text region with appropriate texture.\nThe fusion module combines the information from the two former modules, and\ngenerates the edited text images. To our knowledge, this work is the first\nattempt to edit text in natural images at the word level. Both visual effects\nand quantitative results on synthetic and real-world dataset (ICDAR 2013) fully\nconfirm the importance and necessity of modular decomposition.

Spatial gradients in the local Alfv\\'en speed\nand variations in the length of magnetic field lines ensure that small scales\nform throughout the propagating wave front due to phase mixing. Additionally,\nthe presence of complex, intricate current sheets associated with the\nbackground field locally modifies the polarisation of the wave front. The\ncombination of these two effects enhances the rate of viscous dissipation,\nparticularly in more complex field configurations. Unlike in classical phase\nmixing configurations, the greater spatial extent of Alfv\\'en speed gradients\nensures that wave energy is deposited over a larger cross-section of the\nmagnetic structure. Further, the complexity of the background magnetic field\nensures that small gradients in a wave driver can map to large gradients within\nthe coronal plasma. The phase mixing of MHD waves in a complex magnetic field\nwill progress throughout the braided volume. As a result, in a non-ideal regime\nwave energy will be dissipated over a greater cross-section than in classical\nphase mixing models. The formation rate of small spatial scales in a\npropagating wave front is a function of the complexity of the background\nmagnetic field. As such, if the coronal field is sufficiently complex it\nremains plausible that phase mixing induced wave heating can contribute to\nmaintaining observed temperatures.

However, the problem has\nbeen considered as a subset of the object segmentation problem. bviously,\nportrait segmentation has its unique requirements. First, because the portrait\nsegmentation is performed in the middle of a whole process of many realworld\napplications, it requires extremely lightweight models. Second, there has not\nbeen any public datasets in this domain that contain a sufficient number of\nimages with unbiased statistics. To solve the problems, we introduce a new\nextremely lightweight portrait segmentation model consisting of a two-branched\narchitecture based on the concentrated-comprehensive convolutions block. Our\nmethod reduces the number of parameters from 2.1M to 37.7K (around 98.2%\nreduction), while maintaining the accuracy within a 1% margin from the\nstate-of-the-art portrait segmentation method.

The Bleher central limit theorem (CLT)\nstates that the distribution of the particle displacement divided by\n$\\sqrt{t\\ln t}$ is Gaussian in the limit of infinite time $t$. However it was\nstressed recently that the slow convergence makes this result unobservable.\nUsing a L\\'{e}vy walk model (LW) of the LG, it was proposed that the use of a\nrescaled Lambert function instead of $\\sqrt{t\\ln t}$ provides a fast\nconvergent, observable CLT, which was confirmed by the LG simulations. We\ndemonstrate here that this result can simplified to a mixed CLT where the\nscaling factor combines normal and anomalous diffusions. For narrow infinite\ncorridors the particle for long time obeys the usual normal diffusion, which\nexplains the previous numerical observations. In the opposite limit of small\nscatterers the Bleher CLT gives a good guiding. In the intermediate cases the\nmixed CLT applies. The Gaussian peak determines moments of order smaller than\ntwo. In contrast, the CLT gives only half the coordinate dispersion. The\nmissing half of the dispersion and also moments of order higher than two are\ndescribed by the distribution's tail (the infinite density) which we derive\nhere. The tail is supported along the infinite corridors and formed by\nanomalously long flights whose duration is comparable with the whole time of\nobservation. The moments' calculation from the tail is confirmed by direct\ncalculation of the fourth moment from the statistics of the backward recurrence\ntime defined as time that elapsed since the last collision. This completes the\nsolution of the LW model allowing full comparison with the LG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 14:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-09"}

The primary science goal of VERITAS-SII is to perform stellar\ndiameter measurements and image analysis in the visible wavebands on a\nselection of bright (m< 6), hot (O/B/A) stars. The VERITAS Collaboration has\nagreed to the deployment and operation of VERITAS-SII during several days each\nmonth around the full moon period when VERITAS does not perform VHE gamma-ray\nobservations. The VERITAS-SII augmentation employs custom high-speed/low-noise\nfocal plane instrumentation using high quantum efficiency photomultiplier\ntubes, and a battery-powered, fiber-optic controlled High Voltage supply. To\nreduce engineering time, VERITAS-SII uses commercially available high-speed\n(250 MS/sec), continuously streaming electronics to record the time dependence\nof the intensity fluctuations at each VERITAS telescope. VERITAS-SII also uses\nfast ( < 100 psec) data acquisition clock synchronization over inter-telescope\ndistances (greater than 100 m) using a commercially available White Rabbit\nbased timing solution. VERITAS-SII is now in full operation at the VERITAS\nobservatory, F.L.Whipple Observatory, Amado, AZ USA.

This paper extends the scope of VB to the case where\nthe variational parameter space is a Riemannian manifold. We develop an\nefficient manifold-based VB algorithm that exploits both the geometric\nstructure of the constraint parameter space and the information geometry of the\nmanifold of VB approximating probability distributions. Our algorithm is\nprovably convergent and achieves a convergence rate of order $\\mathcal\nO(1/\\sqrt{T})$ and $\\mathcal O(1/T^{2-2\\epsilon})$ for a non-convex evidence\nlower bound function and a strongly retraction-convex evidence lower bound\nfunction, respectively.

From\nchatbots to robots, human experience in the developed world is moving towards a\nsocio-technical system in which agents can be technological or biological, with\nincreasingly blurred distinctions between. Given that emotion is a key element\nof human interaction, enabling artificial agents with the ability to reason\nabout affect is a key stepping stone towards a future in which technological\nagents and humans can work together. This paper presents work on building\nintelligent computational agents that integrate both emotion and cognition.\nThese agents are grounded in the well-established social-psychological Bayesian\nAffect Control Theory (BayesAct). The core idea of BayesAct is that humans are\nmotivated in their social interactions by affective alignment: they strive for\ntheir social experiences to be coherent at a deep, emotional level with their\nsense of identity and general world views as constructed through culturally\nshared symbols. This affective alignment creates cohesive bonds between group\nmembers, and is instrumental for collaborations to solidify as relational group\ncommitments. BayesAct agents are motivated in their social interactions by a\ncombination of affective alignment and decision theoretic reasoning, trading\nthe two off as a function of the uncertainty or unpredictability of the\nsituation. This paper provides a high-level view of dual process theories and\nadvances BayesAct as a plausible, computationally tractable model based in\nsocial-psychological theory. We introduce a revised BayesAct model that more\ndeeply integrates social-psychological theorising, and we demonstrate a\ncomponent of the model as being sufficient to account for cognitive biases\nabout fairness, dissonance and conformity. We show how the model can unify\ndifferent exploration strategies in reinforcement learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 15:04:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 01:19:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2019 11:21:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

We report here asymmetric breakup of a charged drop, levitated\nin a loose trap, wherein, the droplet is stabilized at an off-center location\nin the trap. This aspect of levitation leads to an asymmetric breakup of the\ncharged drop, predominantly in a direction opposite to that of gravity. In a\nfirst of its kind of study, we capture the successive events of the droplet\ndeformation, breakup and relaxation of the drop after jet ejection using high\nspeed imaging at a couple of hundred thousand frames per second. A pertinent\nquestion of the effect of the electrodynamic trap parameters such as applied\nvoltage as well as physical parameters such as the size of the drop, gravity\nand conductivity on the characteristics of droplet breakup is also explored. A\nclear effect of the trap strength on the deformation (both symmetric and\nasymmetric) is observed. Moreover, the cone angle at the pole undergoing\nasymmetric breakup is almost independent of the applied field investigated in\nthe experiments. All the experimental observations are compared with numerical\nsimulations carried out using the boundary element method (BEM) in the Stokes\nflow limit. The BEM simulations are also extended to other experimentally\nachievable parameters. It is observed that the breakup is mostly field\ninfluenced, and not field induced. A plausible theory for the observations is\nreported, and a sensitive role of the sign of the charge on the droplet and the\nsign of the end cap potential, as well as the off-center location of the\ndroplet in the trap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 15:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

As part of this investigation, we study the\ntemperature measurements obtained from the same axial plane across five\ndifferent engines yielding a total of 82 data-sets.

To\njustify such discrepancies, we are forced to model about existences of black\nhole mimickers and exotic phenomena acting near the supermassive black holes.\nMotivated by these we study the natures of exotic matters, especially dark\nenergy near the black holes. We choose modified Chaplygin gas as dark energy\ncandidate. Again, the descriptions of gravitational waves or the attenuations\nof them when they are tunnelling through cosmological distances help us to\nmeasure the shear viscosity of the medium through which the waves have been\ntravelled. Delayed decaying models of dark matters also suggest that dark\nenergy and viscosity may come up as a byproduct of such decays or interactions.\nWe consider the viscous nature of the medium, i.e., the dark energy. To do so,\nwe choose an alpha-disc model as proposed by Shakura and Sunyaev. We study the\nvariations of densities through accretion and wind branches for a different\namount of viscosity regulated by the Shakura-Sunyaev's alpha parameter, spin\nparameter and different properties of accreting fluids, viz, the properties of\nadiabatic fluid and modified Chaplygin gas.
