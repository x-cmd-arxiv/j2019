However, source code and system models might not always be\navailable at testing time. On the other hand, if the optimal performance\ntesting policy for the intended objective in a testing process instead could be\nlearned by the testing system, then test automation without advanced\nperformance models could be possible. Furthermore, the learned policy could\nlater be reused for similar software systems under test, thus leading to higher\ntest efficiency. We propose SaFReL, a self-adaptive fuzzy reinforcement\nlearning-based performance testing framework.

Then, the confidence scores of these mappings propagate through\nthe graph structure to locate the answer entities. Finally, these are\naggregated depending on the identified question type. This approach can be\nefficiently implemented as a series of sparse matrix multiplications mimicking\njoins over small local subgraphs. Our evaluation results show that the proposed\napproach outperforms the state-of-the-art on the LC-QuAD benchmark. Moreover,\nwe show that the performance of the approach depends only on the quality of the\nquestion interpretation results, i.e., given a correct relevance score\ndistribution, our approach always produces a correct answer ranking. Our error\nanalysis reveals correct answers missing from the benchmark dataset and\ninconsistencies in the DBpedia knowledge graph. Finally, we provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach accompanied with an ablation\nstudy and an error analysis, which showcase the pitfalls for each of the\nquestion answering components in more detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

In this paper, we consider a\nmultiscale regularization strategy for nonlinear spectral unmixing with\nkernels.

We therefore\npropose an adaptation that directly injects arbitrary conditioning into self\nattention, an approach we call pseudo self attention. Through experiments on\nfour diverse conditional text generation tasks we show that this\nencoder-agnostic technique outperforms strong baselines, produces coherent\ngenerations, and is data efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 17:22:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 02:45:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-12"}

It is often impossible\nto obtain such estimates directly, as the computer is restricted to measuring\nin a fixed computational basis. One common solution splits the operator into a\nweighted sum of Pauli operators and measures each separately, at the cost of\nmany measurements. An improved version collects mutually commuting Pauli\noperators together before measuring all operators within a collection\nsimultaneously. The effectiveness of doing this depends on two factors.\nFirstly, we must understand the improvement offered by a given arrangement of\nPaulis in collections. In our work, we propose two natural metrics for\nquantifying this, operating under the assumption that measurements are\ndistributed optimally among collections so as to minimise the overall finite\nsampling error. Motivated by the mathematical form of these metrics, we\nintroduce SORTED INSERTION, a collecting strategy that exploits the weighting\nof each Pauli operator in the overall sum. Secondly, to measure all Pauli\noperators within a collection simultaneously, a circuit is required to rotate\nthem to the computational basis. In our work, we present two efficient circuit\nconstructions that suitably rotate any collection of $k$ independent commuting\n$n$-qubit Pauli operators using at most $kn-k(k+1)/2$ and $O(kn/\\log k)$\ntwo-qubit gates respectively.

As measured by our metrics, SORTED INSERTION\noutperforms four conventional greedy colouring algorithms that seek the minimum\nnumber of collections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 17:27:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 16:59:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 18:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

Starting from\nthe notion of an edge electron gas put forth by Kohn and Mattsson, we here use\nan \\emph{exactly soluble}, strongly correlated few-electron model of a\nharmonically confined electron gas in order to parameterize the\npositive-definite non-interacting KS KED in terms of the density and its\nreduced second-order gradients.

This scaling invariance ensures the\nexistence of an ultra-light fluctuation that freezes after horizon crossing.

Thus, alternative detection strategies may be necessary to\nstudy planets in clusters that may no longer be bound to a host star. Here, we\nuse the cluster Monte Carlo code CMC to explore the evolution of planetary\nsystems in dense star clusters.

We model the delivery of rocky planets to the\nstellar surface both by planet-planet scattering in a realistic multi-planet\nsystem, and by Lidov-Kozai cycles driven by a more massive planetary or stellar\ncompanion. In both cases almost all planets that are ingested arrive at the\nstar on grazing orbits and hence will dissolve in the surface convection zone.\nWe conclude that super-Earth ingestion is a good explanation for the metal\nenhancement in M67 Y2235, and that a high-resolution spectroscopic survey of\nstellar abundances around the turn-off and main sequence of M67 has the\npotential to constrain the frequency of late-time dynamical instability in\nplanetary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In this context, the magnetic thermal transport\nis a particularly sensitive probe of the elementary spin and exotic topological\nexcitations in unconventional magnetic insulators. However, magnetic\ncontributions to heat conduction are invariably intertwined with lattice\ncontributions, and thus the issue of spin-phonon coupling in determining the\nspin and thermal transport properties becomes more important with emergent\ntopological magnetic system. Here we report the observation of an anomalously\nstrong enhancement of the thermal conductivity, occurring at all relevant\ntemperatures, in the layered honeycomb material CrCl$_3$ in the presence of an\napplied magnetic field. Away from the magnetically ordered phase at low\ntemperatures and small fields, there is no coherent spin contribution to the\nheat conduction, and hence the effect must be caused by a strong suppression of\nthe phonon thermal conductivity due to magnetic fluctuations, which are in turn\nsuppressed by the field. We build an empirical model for the thermal\nconductivity of CrCl$_3$ within a formalism assuming an independently\ndetermined number of spin-flip processes and an efficiency of the phonon\nscattering events they mediate. By extracting the intrinsic phonon thermal\nconductivity we obtain a quantitative description at all fields and\ntemperatures and demonstrate that the scattering efficiency is entirely\nindependent of the field. In this way we use CrCl$_3$ as a model system to\nunderstand the interactions between spin and phonon excitations in the context\nof thermal transport. We anticipate that the completely general framework we\nintroduce will have broad implications for the interpretation of transport\nphenomena in magnetic quantum materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 18:07:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 16:08:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

Our contribution to this field is interpreting the set\nof digital Jordan curves that can exist within a given digital plane as a\nfinite topological space. Computing the topological complexity of this space\ndetermines the minimal number of continuous motion planning rules required to\ntransform one image into another, and determining the motion planners\nassociated to topological complexity provides the specific algorithms for doing\nso.

Most available works limit the gradient noise component to\nbe bounded with probability one or sub-Gaussian and leverage concentration\ninequalities to arrive at high-probability results. We present an alternate\napproach, relying primarily on mean-square arguments and show that a more\nrelaxed relative bound on the gradient noise variance is sufficient to ensure\nefficient escape from saddle-points without the need to inject additional\nnoise, employ alternating step-sizes or rely on a global dispersive noise\nassumption, as long as a gradient noise component is present in a descent\ndirection for every saddle-point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 18:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

This paper describes a modified mobile ad hoc\nsurveillance ecosystem to suite smallholder farmer agents, a communication\nmodel and data collection model designed to cover the spatial interests for the\nscale of surveillance, a deployment plan, the training methodology and\nincentives structure. The paper also presents very early results of\ncontributions from farmer agents, that could be usable in monitoring the\nmovement of planting materials between districts, mapping cassava varieties,\nmultiplication sites, and communities with little or no access to agricultural\nextension services, and possibly guide precision expert surveys in areas of\nhigh disease incidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 19:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

In this paper, we propose a general\nmathematical model framework for the evolutionary dynamics of cancer with\nplasticity and heterogeneity in cancer cells. Cancer is a group of diseases\ninvolving abnormal cell growth, during which abnormal regulations in stem cell\nregeneration are essential for the dynamics of cancer development. In general,\nthe dynamics of stem cell regeneration can be simplified as a $\\mathrm{G_0}$\nphase cell cycle model, which lead to a delay differentiation equation. When\ncell heterogeneity and plasticity are considered, we establish a\ndifferential-integral equation based on the random transition of epigenetic\nstates of stem cells during cell division. The proposed model highlights cell\nheterogeneity and plasticity, and connects the heterogeneity with cell-to-cell\nvariance in cellular behaviors, e.g. proliferation, apoptosis, and\ndifferentiation/senescence, and can be extended to include gene\nmutation-induced tumor development. Hybrid computations models are developed\nbased on the mathematical model framework, and are applied to the process of\ninflammation-induced tumorigenesis and tumor relapse after CAR-T therapy.\nFinally, we give rise to several mathematical problems related to the proposed\ndifferential-integral equation.

Plausible physical\nexplanations for the cause of these long-term variations of the solar cycle are\nstill elusive, with possible theories including stochasticity of alpha effect\nand fluctuations of the differential rotation. It has been suggested recently\nin the literature that there exists a possible relation between the\nspatio-temporal structure of Solar cycle and the nonlinear dynamics of\nmagnetohydrodynamic Rossby waves at the solar tachocline, including both\nwave-wave and wave-mean flow interactions. Here we extend the nonlinear theory\nof MHD Rossby waves presented in a previous article to take into account long\nterm modulation effects due to a recently discovered mechanism that allows\nsignificant energy transfers throughout different wave triads: the precession\nresonance mechanism. We have found a large number of Rossby-Haurwitz wave\ntriads whose frequency mismatches are compatible with the solar cycle\nfrequency. Consequently, by analyzing the reduced dynamics of two triads\ncoupled by a single mode (five-wave system), we have demonstrated that in the\namplitude regime in which precession resonance occurs, the energy transfer\nthroughout the system yields significant long-term modulations on the main\n$\\sim 11$yr period associated with intra-triad energy exchanges. We further\nshow that such modulations display an inverse relationship between the\ncharacteristic wave amplitude and the period of intra-triad energy exchanges,\nwhich is consistent with the Waldmeier's law for the solar cycle. In the\npresence of a constant forcing and dissipation, the five-wave system in the\nprecession resonance regime exhibits irregular amplitude fluctuations with some\nperiods resembling the Grand Minimum states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 20:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-08"}

The distribution of $\\Pi(d)$ is identified only through its\ncharacteristic function. Implications of this result include: (i) The empirical\nnode distribution may not be used as a proxy for or as an estimate to the\nlimiting nodal pmf; (ii) Even in homogeneous graphs, the network-wide degree\ndistribution and the nodal degree distribution may capture vastly different\ninformation; and (iii) Random threshold graphs with exponential distributed\nfitness do not provide an alternative scale-free model to the Barab\\'asi-Albert\nmodel as was argued by some authors; the two models cannot be meaningfully\ncompared in terms of their degree distributions!\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 21:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

We then calculate the\noverlap between our approximate analytical waveforms and an eccentric numerical\nmodel (TaylorT4) to determine the regime of validity (in eccentricity) of the\nformer. With this at hand, we carry out a Fisher analysis to determine the\naccuracy to which Jordan-Brans-Dicke-Fierz theory could be constrained given\nfuture eccentric detections consistent with General Relativity.

Training these models typically\nrequires paired data with direct correspondence between modalities. We\nintroduce the novel problem of translating instances from one modality to\nanother without paired data by leveraging an intermediate modality shared by\nthe two other modalities. To demonstrate this, we take the problem of\ntranslating images to speech. In this case, one could leverage disjoint\ndatasets with one shared modality, e.g., image-text pairs and text-speech\npairs, with text as the shared modality. We call this problem \"skip-modal\ngeneration\" because the shared modality is skipped during the generation\nprocess. We propose a multimodal information bottleneck approach that learns\nthe correspondence between modalities from unpaired data (image and speech) by\nleveraging the shared modality (text). We address fundamental challenges of\nskip-modal generation: 1) learning multimodal representations using a single\nmodel, 2) bridging the domain gap between two unrelated datasets, and 3)\nlearning the correspondence between modalities from unpaired data. We show\nqualitative results on image-to-speech synthesis; this is the first time such\nresults have been reported in the literature.

We\napproach this question from a Bayesian persuasion viewpoint. We consider a\nbasic routing game with two parallel routes and an uncertain state that affects\nthe travel cost on one of the routes. The authority sends a noisy signal of the\nstate to a given fraction of travelers. The information structure (i.e.,\ndistribution of signals in each state) chosen by the authority creates a\nheterogeneous information environment for the routing game. The solution\nconcept governing the travelers' route choices is Bayesian Wardrop Equilibrium.\nWe design an information structure to minimize the average traffic spillover --\nthe amount of equilibrium route flow exceeding a certain threshold -- on one of\nthe routes. We provide an analytical characterization of the optimal\ninformation structure for any fraction of travelers receiving the signal. We\nfind that it can achieve the minimum spillover so long as the fraction of\ntravelers receiving the signal is larger than a threshold (smaller than 1).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 23:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

However, one critical drawback of current\ndefenses is that the robustness enhancement is at the cost of noticeable\nperformance degradation on legitimate data, e.g., large drop in test accuracy.\nThis paper is motivated by pursuing for a better trade-off between adversarial\nrobustness and test accuracy for stochastic network defenses.

In more recent years\nvarious lines of observational evidence, including gamma-ray upper limits, have\ndisfavored this explanation in favor of a synchrotron origin. While the IC/CMB\nmodel generally predicts a high level of gamma-ray emission, it has never been\ndetected. Here we report the detection of a low-state Fermi/LAT gamma-ray\nspectrum associated with two jetted AGN which is consistent with the\npredictions of the IC/CMB model for their X-ray emission. We have used archival\nmultiwavelength observations to make precise predictions for the expected\nminimum flux in the GeV band, assuming that the X-ray emission from the\nkpc-scale jet is entirely due to the IC/CMB process. In both sources -- OJ 287\nand PKS 1510-089 -- the minimum-detected gamma-ray flux level agrees with\npredictions. Both sources exhibit extreme superluminal proper motions relative\nto their jet power, which argues for the well-aligned jets required by the\nIC/CMB model. In the case of PKS~1510-089, it cannot be ruled out that the\nminimum gamma-ray flux level is due to a low state of the variable core which\nonly matches the IC/CMB prediction by chance. Continued long-term monitoring\nwith the Fermi/LAT could settle this issue by detecting a plateau signature in\nthe recombined light-curve which would clearly signal the presence of a\nnon-variable emission component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 03:06:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 11:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Interacting with dynamic touchscreens is difficult\nnon-visually because the visual user interfaces change, interactions often\noccur over multiple different screens, and it is easy to accidentally trigger\ninterface actions while exploring the screen. To solve these problems, we\nintroduce StateLens - a three-part reverse engineering solution that makes\nexisting dynamic touchscreens accessible.

In these systems, superconductivity is often found near a\nmagnetic quantum critical point (QCP) where a magnetic phase vanishes in the\nzero-temperature limit. Moreover, the maximum of superconducting transition\ntemperature Tc frequently locates near the magnetic QCP, suggesting that the\nproliferation of critical spin fluctuations emanating from the QCP plays an\nimportant role in Cooper pairing. In cuprate superconductors, however, the\nsuperconducting dome is usually separated from the antiferromagnetic phase and\nTc attains its maximum value near the verge of enigmatic pseudogap state that\nappears below doping-dependent temperature T*. Thus a clue to the pairing\nmechanism resides in the pseudogap and associated anomalous transport\nproperties.

Near the pseudogap end point, where Tc is not far from its\npeak in the superconducting dome, nematic susceptibility becomes singular and\ndivergent, indicating the presence of a nematic QCP.

Recently, cumulative\nevidence indicates that extragalactic GCs that are older than 2 Gyr, seem to\nalso harbor MPs, however, those that are younger than 2 Gyr do not. These\nobservations seem to imply that age is a primary property that controls the\npresence of MPs in star clusters. However, because of the lack of studies of\n{intermediate-age (~2--6 Gyr-old),} low mass clusters, it is unclear if the\ncluster mass, in addition to age, also plays a role in the occurrence of MPs.\nIn this work, we studied a $\\sim$4 Gyr-old, low mass (~23,000 Msun) cluster,\nLindsay-113, in the Small Magellanic Cloud.

The\ncomparison of observations with predictions from synthetic spectra indicates\nthat the internal chemical spread in nitrogen abundance, which is a signature\nof MPs, would not exceed 0.2 dex.

In particular, we focus on\nthe problem of capturing 3D information about Grevy's zebras from a collection\nof images. The Grevy's zebra is one of the most endangered species in Africa,\nwith only a few thousand individuals left. Capturing the shape and pose of\nthese animals can provide biologists and conservationists with information\nabout animal health and behavior. In contrast to research on human pose, shape\nand texture estimation, training data for endangered species is limited, the\nanimals are in complex natural scenes with occlusion, they are naturally\ncamouflaged, travel in herds, and look similar to each other. To overcome these\nchallenges, we integrate the recent SMAL animal model into a network-based\nregression pipeline, which we train end-to-end on synthetically generated\nimages with pose, shape, and background variation. Going beyond\nstate-of-the-art methods for human shape and pose estimation, our method learns\na shape space for zebras during training. Learning such a shape space from\nimages using only a photometric loss is novel, and the approach can be used to\nlearn shape in other settings with limited 3D supervision. Moreover, we couple\n3D pose and shape prediction with the task of texture synthesis, obtaining a\nfull texture map of the animal from a single image. We show that the predicted\ntexture map allows a novel per-instance unsupervised optimization over the\nnetwork features.

As a result of the increasing\npedestrian demand in public space, the limits of pedestrian spaces are of\nincreasing interest. Some research on the maximum demand that can flow through\na cross-section has been presented, which mainly features simple movement base\ncases, low-density situations and/or a homogeneous crowd. Consequently, it is\ncurrently unclear to what extent their findings apply to heterogeneous\nhigh-density crowds, which are often encountered during real-world scenarios.\nThe CrowdLimits experiment attempted to reproduce crowd movement dynamics of\nheterogeneous crowds experiencing higher densities than have been recorded up\nto this moment. Here, the aim was to study the impact of the three important\ndifferences between the current laboratory studies and real-world crowd\ndynamics in crowded pedestrian spaces simultaneously, namely crowd\nheterogeneity, high densities movements, and (more) complex movement base\ncases. This study shows that there are substantial differences in the maximum\nsustainable flow rate, and the maximum local and global sustainable density for\ndistinct movement base cases and flow ratios. Moreover, the results provide\nevidence of that continuation of flow under very high densities can be\nrecreated under laboratory conditions using a heterogeneous population of\npedestrians. Besides, the experimental results indicate that the maximum global\nflow rate decreases when the scenario becomes more difficult (i.e.\nbidirectional to intersecting) and the collision avoidance opportunities\ndecrease (i.e. 80-20 to 50-50 flow ratio). Thus, this paper concludes that the\nmaximum flow rate of pedestrian infrastructures decreases with increasing\ncomplexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 08:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

Recent research has shown that such problems can be\napproached by learning a natural motion manifold using deep learning to address\nthe shortcomings of traditional data-driven approaches. However, previous\nmethods can be sub-optimal for two reasons. First, the skeletal information has\nnot been fully utilized for feature extraction. Unlike images, it is difficult\nto define spatial proximity in skeletal motions in the way that deep networks\ncan be applied. Second, motion is time-series data with strong multi-modal\ntemporal correlations. A frame could be followed by several candidate frames\nleading to different motions; long-range dependencies exist where a number of\nframes in the beginning correlate to a number of frames later. Ineffective\nmodeling would either under-estimate the multi-modality and variance, resulting\nin featureless mean motion or over-estimate them resulting in jittery motions.\nIn this paper, we propose a new deep network to tackle these challenges by\ncreating a natural motion manifold that is versatile for many applications. The\nnetwork has a new spatial component for feature extraction. It is also equipped\nwith a new batch prediction model that predicts a large number of frames at\nonce, such that long-term temporally-based objective functions can be employed\nto correctly learn the motion multi-modality and variances. With our system,\nlong-duration motions can be predicted/synthesized using an open-loop setup\nwhere the motion retains the dynamics accurately.

This is the region where\nthe force-free approximation should work the best, and where the jets are\nlocated. We perform a systematic study of the asymptotic region with\n(split-)monopole, paraboloidal and vertical asymptotic behaviors.

To\nestimate the relevant statistics in the neighbourhood of an accreting\nprotostar, we perform high resolution numerical simulations. We also use these\nsimulations to further test the idea that fragmentation in the vicinity of an\nexisting protostar is determinant in setting the peak of the stellar mass\nspectrum.

In such dynamic scenarios, robotic\ntasks may be programmed through learning-from-demonstration approaches, where a\nnominal plan of the task is learned by the robot. However, the learned plan may\nneed to be adapted in order to fulfill additional requirements or overcome\nunexpected environment changes. When the required adaptation occurs at the\nend-effector trajectory level, a human operator may want to intuitively show\nthe robot the desired changes by physically interacting with it. In this\nscenario, the robot needs to understand the human intended changes from noisy\nhaptic data, quickly adapt accordingly and execute the nominal task plan when\nno further adaptation is needed. This paper addresses the aforementioned\nchallenges by leveraging LfD and Bayesian optimization to endow the robot with\ndata-efficient adaptation capabilities. Our approach exploits the sensed\ninteraction forces to guide the robot adaptation, and speeds up the\noptimization process by defining local search spaces extracted from the learned\ntask model.

This paper pushes forward high-resolution\nsaliency detection, and contributes a new dataset, named High-Resolution\nSalient Object Detection (HRSOD). To our best knowledge, HRSOD is the first\nhigh-resolution saliency detection dataset to date. As another contribution, we\nalso propose a novel approach, which incorporates both global semantic\ninformation and local high-resolution details, to address this challenging\ntask.

Our aims are to characterize the\noptical properties of different classes based on radio-loudness within the\nquasar main sequence (MS) and to test whether the condition RK > 10 is\nsufficient for the identification of RL AGNs. A sample of 355 quasars was\nselected by cross-correlating the FIRST survey with the SDSS DR14 quasar\ncatalog. We classified the optical spectra according to their spectral types\nalong the quasars MS. For each spectral type, we distinguished compact and\nextended morphology, and three classes of radio-loudness: detected (specific\nflux ratio in the g band and at 1.4GHz, RK' < 10, RD), intermediate (10 < RK' <\n70, RI), and radio loud (RK' > 70). The analysis revealed systematic\ndifferences between RD, RI, and RL in each spectral type along the MS. We show\nthat spectral bins that contain the extreme Population A sources have radio\npower compatible with emission by mechanisms ultimately due to star formation\nprocesses. RL sources of Population B are characteristically jetted. Their\nbroad H-beta profiles can be interpreted as due to a binary broad-line region.\nWe suggest that RL Population B sources should be preferential targets for the\nsearch of black hole binaries, and present a sample of binary black hole AGN\ncandidates. The validity of the Kellermann's criterion may be dependent on the\nsource location along the quasar MS.

The study of such systems goes back to Turing, who\nshowed how patterns can emerge from a homogenous steady state when two reactive\ncomponents have different diffusivities (e.g. membrane-bound and cytosolic\nstates). However, in nature, systems typically develop in a heterogeneous\nenvironment, where upstream protein patterns affect the formation of protein\npatterns downstream. Examples for this are the polarization of Cdc42 adjacent\nto the previous bud-site in budding yeast, and the formation of an\nactin-recruiter ring that forms around a PIP3 domain in macropinocytosis. This\nsuggests that previously established protein patterns can serve as a template\nfor downstream proteins and that these downstream proteins can 'sense' the edge\nof the template.

With the number of surgical procedures increasing annually,\nthere is an unprecedented need to provide an accurate, objective and automatic\nevaluation of trainees' surgical skills in order to improve surgical practice.\nMethods: In this paper, we designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to\nclassify surgical skills by extracting latent patterns in the trainees' motions\nperformed during robotic surgery. The method is validated on the JIGSAWS\ndataset for two surgical skills evaluation tasks: classification and\nregression.

Altering the ball to simplify\nthe tracking using for instance infrared coating changes the physics of the\nball trajectory. As a result, table tennis systems use custom tracking systems\nto track the ball based on heuristic algorithms respecting the real time\nconstrains applied to RGB images captured with a set of cameras. However, these\nheuristic algorithms often report erroneous ball positions, and the table\ntennis policies typically need to incorporate additional heuristics to detect\nand possibly correct outliers. In this paper, we propose a vision system for\nobject detection and tracking that focus on reliability while providing real\ntime performance. Our assumption is that by using multiple cameras, we can find\nand discard the errors obtained in the object detection phase by checking for\nconsistency with the positions reported by other cameras. We provide an open\nsource implementation of the proposed tracking system to simplify future\nresearch in robot table tennis or related tracking applications with strong\nreal time requirements. We evaluate the proposed system thoroughly in\nsimulation and in the real system, outperforming previous work. Furthermore, we\nshow that the accuracy and robustness of the proposed system increases as more\ncameras are added. Finally, we evaluate the table tennis playing performance of\nan existing method in the real robot using the proposed vision system. We\nmeasure a slight increase in performance compared to a previous vision system\neven after removing all the heuristics previously present to filter out\nerroneous ball observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 13:35:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

However, currently available observations only allow deriving weak\nconclusions about the existence of water ice in debris disks. We investigate\nwhether it is feasible to detect water ice in typical debris disk systems.

We consider icy dust mixture particles with various\nshapes consisting of amorphous ice, crystalline ice, astrosilicate, and vacuum\ninclusions.

Water can originate from interplanetary dust particles, icy rings and\nsatellites and large comet impacts. Analysis of Herschel Space Observatory\nobservations have proven that the bulk of Jupiter's stratospheric water was\ndelivered by the Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacts in 1994. In 2006, the Cassini mission\ndetected water plumes at the South Pole of Enceladus, placing the moon as a\nserious candidate for Saturn's stratospheric water. Further evidence was found\nin 2011, when Herschel demonstrated the presence of a water torus at the\norbital distance of Enceladus, fed by the moon's plumes. Finally, water falling\nfrom the rings onto Saturn's uppermost atmospheric layers at low latitudes was\ndetected during the final orbits of Cassini's end-of-mission plunge into the\natmosphere. Aims. In this paper, we use Herschel mapping observations of water\nin Saturn's stratosphere to identify its source. Methods. Several empirical\nmodels are tested against the Herschel-HIFI and -PACS observations, which were\ncollected on December 30, 2010, and January 2nd, 2011 (respectively). Results.\nWe demonstrate that Saturn's stratospheric water is not uniformly mixed as a\nfunction of latitude, but peaking at the equator and decreasing poleward with a\nGaussian distribution. We obtain our best fit with an equatorial mole fraction\n1.1 ppb and a half-width at half-maximum of 25{\\deg}, when accounting for a\ntemperature increase in the two warm stratospheric vortices produced by\nSaturn's Great Storm of 2010-2011. Conclusions. This work demonstrates that\nEnceladus is the main source of Saturn's stratospheric water.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 14:39:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

The algorithm consists of two steps; first\nan evaluation of a nonlinear forward-backward map followed by a relaxed\nprojection onto the separating hyperplane it constructs. The key of the method\nis the nonlinearity in the forward-backward step, where the backward part is\nbased on a nonlinear resolvent construction that allows for the kernel in the\nresolvent to be a nonlinear single-valued maximal monotone operator. This\ngeneralizes the standard resolvent as well as the Bregman resolvent, whose\nresolvent kernels are gradients of convex functions. This construction opens up\nfor a new understanding of many existing operator splitting methods and paves\nthe way for devising new algorithms. In particular, we present a four-operator\nsplitting method as a special case of NOFOB that relies nonlinearity and\nnonsymmetry in the forward-backward kernel. We show that\nforward-backward-forward splitting (FBF), forward-backward-half-forward\nsplitting (FBHF), asymmetric forward-backward-adjoint splitting (AFBA) with its\nmany special cases, as well as synchronous projective splitting are special\ncases of the four-operator splitting method and hence of NOFOB. We also show\nthat standard formulations of FB(H)F use smaller relaxations in the projections\nthan allowed in NOFOB. Besides proving convergence for NOFOB, we show linear\nconvergence under a metric subregularity assumption, which in a unified manner\nshows (in some cases new) linear convergence results for its special cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 15:53:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 06:38:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 09:12:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

However, one of the problems, in anthropology including\npalaeoanthropology (more often there), is the lack of big enough samples or the\nexistence of samples without sufficiently measured traits. Since 1969, with the\nadvent of bootstrapping techniques, this issue has been tackled successfully in\nmany different ways. Here, we present a parametric bootstrap technique based on\nthe fact that the transformed $ \\theta $, obtained from the Anscombe\ntransformation to stabilize the variance, nearly follows a normal distribution\nwith zero mean and variance $ \\sigma^2 = 1 / (N + 1/2) $, where $ N $ is the\nsize of the measured trait. When the probabilistic distribution is known,\nparametric procedures offer more powerful results than non-parametric ones. We\nprofit from knowing the probabilistic distribution of $ \\theta $ to develop a\nparametric bootstrapping method. We explain it carefully with mathematical\nsupport. We give examples, both with artificial data and with real ones.

Using patient data, we compare the\nproposed method to the benchmark Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization\n(OSEM) algorithm using signal-to-noise ratio, bias, mean absolute error and\nstructural similarity measures.

In interplanetary orbit determination, Doppler\nobservables, obtained by measuring the average frequency shift of the received\ncarrier signal over a certain count time, are compared against their predicted\nvalues, usually computed by differencing two round-trip light-times. This\nformulation is known to be sensitive to round-off errors, caused by the use of\nfinite arithmetic in the computation, giving rise to an additional noise in the\nresiduals, called numerical noise, that degrades the accuracy of the orbit\ndetermination solution.

The objective of NILM is to identify the power consumption of\nindividual appliances and to detect when particular devices are on or off from\nmeasuring the power consumption of an entire house. This information allows\nhouseholds to receive customized advice on how to better manage their\nelectrical consumption. In this paper, we present an alternative NILM method\nthat breaks down the aggregated power signal into categories of appliances. The\nultimate goal is to use this approach for demand-side management to estimate\npotential flexibility within the electricity consumption of households. Our\nmethod is implemented as an algorithm combining NILM and load profile\nsimulation. This algorithm, based on a Markov model, allocates an activity\nchain to each inhabitant of the household, deduces from the whole-house power\nmeasurement and statistical data the appliance usage, generate the power\nprofile accordingly and finally returns the share of energy consumed by each\nappliance category over time. To analyze its performance, the algorithm was\nbenchmarked against several state-of-the-art NILM algorithms and tested on\nthree public datasets. The proposed algorithm is unsupervised; hence it does\nnot require any labeled data, which are expensive to acquire. Although better\nperformance is shown for the supervised algorithms, our proposed unsupervised\nalgorithm achieves a similar range of uncertainty while saving on the cost of\nacquiring labeled data. Additionally, our method requires lower computational\npower compared to most of the tested NILM algorithms. It was designed for\nlow-sampling-rate power measurement (every 15 min), which corresponds to the\nfrequency range of most common smart meters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 15:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}

Modern discussions of the topic\ntend to use mid-19th century physics, neglecting both locality and Noether's\ntheorem and its converse. The relevance of General Relativity (GR) has rarely\nbeen considered. But a few authors have proposed that the non-localizability of\ngravitational energy and consequent lack of physically meaningful local\nconservation laws answers the conservation objection to mental causation:\nconservation already fails in GR, so there is nothing for minds to violate.\n  This paper is motivated by two ideas. First, one might take seriously the\nfact that GR formally has an infinity of rigid symmetries of the action and\nhence, by Noether's first theorem, an infinity of conserved energies-momenta\n(thus answering Schr\\\"{o}dinger's 1918 false-negative objection). Second, Sean\nCarroll has asked (rhetorically) how one should modify the\nDirac-Maxwell-Einstein equations to describe mental causation. This paper uses\nthe generalized Bianchi identities to show that General Relativity tends to\nexclude, not facilitate, such Cartesian mental causation. In the simplest case,\nCartesian mental influence must be spatio-temporally constant, and hence 0. The\ndifficulty may diminish for more complicated models. Its persuasiveness is also\naffected by larger world-view considerations.\n  The new general relativistic objection provides some support for realism\nabout gravitational energy-momentum in GR (taking pseudotensor laws seriously).\nSuch realism also answers an objection to theories of causation involving\nconserved quantities, because energies-momenta would be conserved even in GR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 14:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}
