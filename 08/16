Methods: A deep learning model\nbased on an ensemble of encoder-decoder architectures was implemented and\noptimized for the segmentation of GA in CFIs. Four experienced graders\ndelineated GA in CFIs from RS and BMES. These manual delineations were used to\nevaluate the segmentation model using 5-fold cross-validation.

Linear\nregression analysis was used to study associations between structural\nbiomarkers at baseline and GA growth rate. A general estimate of the\nprogression of GA area over time was made by combining growth rates of all eyes\nwith GA from the AREDS set. Results: The model obtained an average Dice\ncoefficient of 0.72 $\\pm$ 0.26 on the BMES and RS.

Topological edge\nstates, for instance, have been realized in versatile systems including\nelectromagnetic-waves. Typically, topological properties are revealed in\nmomentum space, using concepts such as Chern number and Berry phase. Here, we\ndemonstrate a universal mapping of the topology of Dirac-like cones from\nmomentum space to real space. We evince the mapping by exciting the cones in\nphotonic honeycomb (pseudospin-1/2) and Lieb (pseudospin-1) lattices with\nvortex beams of topological charge l, optimally aligned for a chosen pseudospin\nstate s, leading to direct observation of topological charge conversion that\nfollows the rule of l to l+2s. The mapping is theoretically accounted for all\ninitial excitation conditions with the pseudospin-orbit interaction and\nnontrivial Berry phases. Surprisingly, such a mapping exists even in a deformed\nlattice where the total angular momentum is not conserved, unveiling its\ntopological origin. The universality of the mapping extends beyond the photonic\nplatform and 2D lattices: equivalent topological conversion occurs for 3D\nDirac-Weyl synthetic magnetic monopoles, which could be realized in ultracold\natomic gases and responsible for mechanism behind the vortex creation in\nelectron beams traversing a magnetic monopole field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 16:47:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

However, we find that the loss\nfunctions adopted by single-stage object detectors hurt the localization\naccuracy seriously. Firstly, the standard cross-entropy loss for classification\nis independent of the localization task and drives all the positive examples to\nlearn as high classification scores as possible regardless of localization\naccuracy during training. As a result, there will be many detections that have\nhigh classification scores but low IoU or detections that have low\nclassification scores but high IoU. Secondly, for the standard smooth L1 loss,\nthe gradient is dominated by the outliers that have poor localization accuracy\nduring training.

Given the knowledge of the existence of localized glitches\nin particular segments of data, we also develop a method to insulate\nstatistical inference from these glitches, so as to cleanly excise them without\naffecting the search background in neighboring seconds. We show the importance\nof applying these methods on the publicly available LIGO data, and measure an\nincrease in the detection volume of at least $15\\%$ from the PSD-drift\ncorrection alone, due to the improved background distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 17:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

We find broad agreement with observed cluster UDGs and predict\nthat they are not separate from the overall cluster dwarf population. UDGs in\ncluster environments form primarily from dwarf galaxies that experienced early\ncluster in-fall and subsequent quenching due to ram pressure. The ensuing\ndimming of these dwarf galaxies due to passive stellar evolution results in a\npopulation of very low surface brightness galaxies that are otherwise typical\ndwarfs. UDGs and non-UDGs alike are affected by tidal interactions with the\ncluster potential. Tidal stripping of dark matter, as well as mass loss from\nstellar evolution, results in the adiabatic expansion of stars, particularly in\nthe lowest mass dwarfs. High mass dwarf galaxies show signatures of tidal\nheating while low mass dwarfs that survive until $z=0$ typically have not\nexperienced such impulsive interactions. There is little difference between\nUDGs and non-UDGs in terms of their dark matter halos, stellar morphology,\ncolors, and location within the cluster. In most respects cluster UDG and\nnon-UDGs alike are similar to isolated dwarf galaxies, except for the fact that\nthey are typically quenched.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 17:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

One\nproposed microscopic mechanism for this effect entails an increase in\nhydrophobicity upon mutagenesis. Recent crystal structures of a double mutant\nthat includes the P23T mutation allows for a more careful investigation of this\nproposal. Here, we first measure the surface hydrophobicity of various mutant\nstructures of this protein and determine that it does not discernibly increase\nupon the mutating the 23$^\\mathrm{rd}$ residue. We then investigate the\nsolubility inversion regime with a schematic patchy particle model that\nincludes one of three models for temperature-dependent patch energies: two of\nthe hydrophobic effect, and a more generic description. We conclude that while\nsolubility inversion due to the hydrophobic effect may be possible, microscopic\nevidence to support it in $\\gamma$D-crystallin is weak. More generally, we find\nthat solubility inversion requires a fine balance between patch strengths and\nthe temperature-dependent contribution, which may explain why inverted\nsolubility is not commonly observed in proteins.

This is a natural relaxation of the perfect matching\nproblem, in which each node is selected just by one neighbor. Previous\n(approximate) solutions for backup placement are non-trivial, even for simple\ngraph topologies, such as dense graphs. In this paper we devise an algorithm\nfor dense graph topologies, including unit disk graphs, unit ball graphs, line\ngraphs, graphs with bounded diversity, and many more. Our algorithm requires\njust one round, and is as simple as the following operation. Consider a\ncircular list of neighborhood IDs, sorted in an ascending order, and select the\nID that is next to the selecting vertex ID. Surprisingly, such a simple\none-round strategy turns out to be very efficient for backup placement\ncomputation in dense networks. Not only that it improves the number of rounds\nof the solution, but also the approximation ratio is improved by a\nmultiplicative factor of at least $2$.\n  Our new algorithm has several interesting implications. In particular, it\ngives rise to a $(2 + \\epsilon)$-approximation to maximum matching within\n$O(\\log^* n)$ rounds in dense networks. The resulting algorithm is very simple\nas well, in sharp contrast to previous algorithms that compute such a solution\nwithin this running time. Moreover, these algorithms are applicable to a\nnarrower graph family than our algorithm. For the same graph family, the best\npreviously-known result has $O(\\log {\\Delta} + \\log^* n)$ running time.

This paper investigates\nthe question of when modifying $K$ by adding $m>0$ half-twists to two\noppositely-oriented strands, while keeping the rest of $K$ fixed, produces a\nknot isotopic to $K$. Such a two-strand twist of order $m$, as we define it, is\na generalized crossing change when $m$ is even and a non-coherent band surgery\nwhen $m=1$. A cosmetic two-strand twist on $K$ is a non-nugatory one that\nproduces an isotopic knot. We prove that fibered knots in $M$ admit no cosmetic\ngeneralized crossing changes. Further, we show that if $K$ is fibered, then a\ntwo-strand twist of odd order $m$ that is determined by a separating arc in a\nfiber surface for $K$ can only be cosmetic if $m=\\pm 1$.\n  After proving these theorems, we further investigate cosmetic two-strand\ntwists of odd orders.

As an application, we prove\nthat every cosmetic band surgery on the unknot is of this type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 18:34:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:55:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 17:51:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

The role of resonance in performance\nremains unclear for two reasons: i) a lack of definition of resonance for the\nfully-coupled fluid-structure interaction system in a viscous flow, and ii) the\npresence of nonlinear effects, which makes it difficult to disentangle resonant\nand non-resonant mechanisms in finite-amplitude swimming. We address point i)\nand provide an unambiguous definition for system resonance by computing global\nlinear stability modes of the fully-coupled fluid-structure interaction system\nthat account for the viscous fluid, the plate, and the coupling between them.\nWe then resolve point ii) by considering high-fidelity nonlinear simulations of\nsystematically increased amplitude. By comparing the results for different\namplitudes with one another and with the linear stability modes, we separate\nlinear and/or resonant effects from nonlinear and/or non-resonant effects.\nResonant behavior is observed over a wide range of plate stiffnesses, with\npeaks in trailing-edge motion and thrust occurring near the resonant frequency\ndefined by the global linear analysis. The peaks broaden and weaken with\nincreasing heave amplitude, consistent with an increased damping effect from\nthe fluid. At the same time, non-resonant mechanisms are present at large heave\namplitudes. The input power exhibits qualitatively different dynamics at large\nheave amplitudes compared to smaller heave amplitudes, where resonance\ndominates. Moreover, leading-edge separation is present for stiff plates at\nlarge heave amplitudes, which can drastically alter the performance\ncharacteristics from what one would expect through linear predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 18:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

The apparently complicated dynamics\ncan in most cases be described as simple precession of the orbital angular\nmomentum about an approximately fixed total angular momentum. However, the\nimprint of the precession on the observed gravitational-wave signal is yet more\ncomplicated, with a non-trivial time-varying dependence on black-hole dynamics,\nthe binary's orientation and the detector polarization. As a result, it is\ndifficult to predict under which conditions precession effects are measurable\nin gravitational-wave observations, and their impact on both signal detection\nand source characterization. We show that the observed waveform can be\nsimplified by decomposing it as a power series in a new precession parameter $b\n= \\tan(\\beta/2)$, where $\\beta$ is the opening angle between the orbital and\ntotal angular momenta. The power series is made up of five harmonics, with\nfrequencies that differ by the binary's precession frequency, and individually\ndo not exhibit amplitude and phase modulations. In many cases, the waveform can\nbe well approximated by the two leading harmonics. In this approximation we are\nable to obtain a simple picture of precession as caused by the beating of two\nwaveforms of similar frequency. This enables us to identify regions of the\nparameter space where precession is likely to have an observable effect on the\nwaveform, and to propose a new approach to searching for signals from\nprecessing binaries, based upon the two-harmonic approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 18:54:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 09:46:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

In this paper, we\nelaborate on this picture, particularly emphasizing the importance of the\nchaotic nature of the string (UV) dynamics across all low energy species in\ngenerating large (IR) spacetime behind the horizon. Implications of this UV/IR\nrelation include O(1) breaking of global symmetries at the string scale and a\nself-repair mechanism of black holes restoring the smoothness of their\nhorizons.

To begin to address this challenge, we examine the use of online\nstep-size adaptation using a sensor-rich robotic arm. Our method of choice,\nTemporal-Difference Incremental Delta-Bar-Delta (TIDBD), learns and adapts step\nsizes on a feature level; importantly, TIDBD allows step-size tuning and\nrepresentation learning to occur at the same time. We show that TIDBD is a\npractical alternative for classic Temporal-Difference (TD) learning via an\nextensive parameter search. Both approaches perform comparably in terms of\npredicting future aspects of a robotic data stream. Furthermore, the use of a\nstep-size adaptation method like TIDBD appears to allow a system to\nautomatically detect and characterize common sensor failures in a robotic\napplication.

Reasoning about reachability is difficult for two\nmain reasons. First, any heap modification may affect an unbounded number of\nreference chains, which complicates modular verification, in particular,\nframing. Second, general graph reachability is not supported by SMT solvers,\nwhich impedes automatic verification. In this paper, we present a modular\nspecification and verification technique for reachability properties in\nseparation logic. For each method, we specify reachability only locally within\nthe fragment of the heap on which the method operates. A novel form of\nreachability framing for relatively convex subheaps allows one to extend\nreachability properties from the heap fragment of a callee to the larger\nfragment of its caller, enabling precise procedure-modular reasoning. Our\ntechnique supports practically important heap structures, namely acyclic graphs\nwith a bounded outdegree as well as (potentially cyclic) graphs with at most\none path (modulo cycles) between each pair of nodes. The integration into\nseparation logic allows us to reason about reachability and other properties in\na uniform way, to verify concurrent programs, and to automate our technique via\nexisting separation logic verifiers. We demonstrate that our verification\ntechnique is amenable to SMT-based verification by encoding a number of\nbenchmark examples into the Viper verification infrastructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 00:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

In this paper, we formulate a linear\nstochastic multi-armed bandit problem with safety constraints that depend\n(linearly) on an unknown parameter vector. As such, the learner is unable to\nidentify all safe actions and must act conservatively in ensuring that her\nactions satisfy the safety constraint at all rounds (at least with high\nprobability). For these bandits, we propose a new UCB-based algorithm called\nSafe-LUCB, which includes necessary modifications to respect safety\nconstraints. The algorithm has two phases. During the pure exploration phase\nthe learner chooses her actions at random from a restricted set of safe actions\nwith the goal of learning a good approximation of the entire unknown safe set.\nOnce this goal is achieved, the algorithm begins a safe\nexploration-exploitation phase where the learner gradually expands their\nestimate of the set of safe actions while controlling the growth of regret. We\nprovide a general regret bound for the algorithm, as well as a problem\ndependent bound that is connected to the location of the optimal action within\nthe safe set.

We first develop an embedded C++\nStructure of Arrays (SOA) data layout DSL for SMMO applications. We then design\na lock-free, dynamic memory allocator that stores allocations in SOA layout.\nFinally, we show how to further optimize the memory access of SMMO applications\nwith memory defragmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 04:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

Rent-by-the-minute pricing and a healthy competition between\nmicromobility service providers is also benefiting riders with low trip costs.\nHowever, an unprepared urban infrastructure, combined with uncertain operation\npolicies and poor regulation enforcement, has resulted in e-scooter riders\nencroaching public spaces meant for pedestrians, thus causing significant\nsafety concerns both for themselves and the pedestrians. As a consequence, it\nhas become critical to understand the current state of pedestrian safety in our\nurban communities vis-\\`{a}-vis e-scooter services, identify factors that\nimpact pedestrian safety due to such services, and determine how to support\npedestrian safety going forward. Unfortunately, to date there have been no\nrealistic, data-driven efforts within the research community that address these\nissues. In this work, we conduct a field study to empirically investigate\ncrowd-sensed encounter data between e-scooters and pedestrian participants on\ntwo urban university campuses over a three-month period. We also analyze\nencounter statistics and mobility trends that could identify potentially unsafe\nspatio-temporal zones for pedestrians.

The primary\naversion towards the latter genre is due to its prohibitively slow iterative\noptimization requirement during inference to find a matching noise prior for a\nmasked image. In this paper, we show that priors matter in GAN: we learn a data\ndriven parametric network to predict a matching prior for a given image. This\nconverts an iterative paradigm to a single feed forward inference pipeline with\na massive 1500X speedup and simultaneous improvement in reconstruction quality.\nWe show that an additional structural prior imposed on GAN model results in\nhigher fidelity outputs.

Yan et al. reformulated the centralized coded\ncaching scheme as designing a corresponding $F\\times K$ array called placement\ndelivery array (PDA), where $F$ is the subpacketization and $K$ is the number\nof users. Motivated by several constructions of PDAs, we introduce a framework\nfor constructing PDAs, where each row is indexed by a row vector of some matrix\ncalled row index matrix and each column's index is labelled by an element of a\ndirect product set. Using this framework, a new scheme is obtained, which can\nbe regarded as a generalization of some previously known schemes. When $K$ is\nequal to ${m\\choose t}q^t$ for positive integers $m$, $t$ with $t<m$ and $q\\geq\n2$, we show that the row index matrix must be an orthogonal array if all the\nusers have the same memory size. Furthermore, the row index matrix must be a\ncovering array if the coded gain is ${m\\choose t}$, which is the maximal coded\ngain under our framework. Consequently the lower bounds on the transmission\nload and subpacketization of the schemes are derived under our framework.\nFinally, using orthogonal arrays as the row index matrix, we obtain two more\nexplicit classes of schemes which have significantly advantages on the\nsubpacketization while the transmission load is equal or close to that of the\nschemes constructed by Shangguan et al.

In this paper, we propose a framework to alleviate the\naccuracy decline when semantic segmentation is taken to adverse conditions by\nusing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). To bridge the daytime and\nnighttime image domains, we made key observation that compared to datasets in\nadverse conditions, there are considerable amount of segmentation datasets in\nstandard conditions such as BDD and our collected ZJU datasets. Our GAN-based\nnighttime semantic segmentation framework includes two methods. In the first\nmethod, GANs were used to translate nighttime images to the daytime, thus\nsemantic segmentation can be performed using robust models already trained on\ndaytime datasets. In another method, we use GANs to translate different ratio\nof daytime images in the dataset to the nighttime but still with their labels.\nIn this sense, synthetic nighttime segmentation datasets can be generated to\nyield models prepared to operate at nighttime conditions robustly. In our\nexperiment, the later method significantly boosts the performance at the\nnighttime evidenced by quantitative results using Intersection over Union (IoU)\nand Pixel Accuracy (Acc).

However, in contrast to still images, manually annotating\nvideo attributes needs to consider spatiotemporal evolution which is inherently\nmuch harder and more costly. Critically, the most interesting crowd behaviors\ncaptured in surveillance videos (e.g., street fighting, flash mobs) are either\nrare, thus have few examples for model training, or unseen previously. Existing\ncrowd analysis techniques are not readily scalable to recognize novel (unseen)\ncrowd behaviors. To address this problem, we investigate and develop methods\nfor recognizing visual crowd behavioral attributes without any training\nsamples, i.e., zero-shot learning crowd behavior recognition. To that end, we\nrelax the common assumption that each individual crowd video instance is only\nassociated with a single crowd attribute. Instead, our model learns to jointly\nrecognize multiple crowd behavioral attributes in each video instance by\nexploring multiattribute cooccurrence as contextual knowledge for optimizing\nindividual crowd attribute recognition. Joint multilabel attribute prediction\nin zero-shot learning is inherently nontrivial because cooccurrence statistics\ndoes not exist for unseen attributes. To solve this problem, we learn to\npredict cross-attribute cooccurrence from both online text corpus and\nmultilabel annotation of videos with known attributes. Our experiments show\nthat this approach to modeling multiattribute context not only improves\nzero-shot crowd behavior recognition on the WWW crowd video dataset, but also\ngeneralizes to novel behavior (violence) detection cross-domain in the Violence\nFlow video dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 08:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

Thus we establish a systematic framework in\nterm of the polar spectrum to analyze and construct polar codes.

On the other hand, the whole network\nis split into two paths to learn the high-level semantic features separately.\nMoreover, a contextual feature for orientation prediction is extracted, which\nrepresents the bilateral cue of the foreground and background areas. The\nbilateral cue is then fused with the occlusion cue to precisely locate the\nobject regions. Finally, a stripe convolution is designed to further aggregate\nfeatures from surrounding scenes of the occlusion edge. The proposed OFNet\nremarkably advances the state-of-the-art approaches on PIOD and BSDS ownership\ndataset.

The first problem is the trade-off between speed and accuracy.\nThe second one is to model the arbitrary-shaped text instance. Recently, some\nmethods have been proposed to tackle arbitrary-shaped text detection, but they\nrarely take the speed of the entire pipeline into consideration, which may fall\nshort in practical applications.In this paper, we propose an efficient and\naccurate arbitrary-shaped text detector, termed Pixel Aggregation Network\n(PAN), which is equipped with a low computational-cost segmentation head and a\nlearnable post-processing. More specifically, the segmentation head is made up\nof Feature Pyramid Enhancement Module (FPEM) and Feature Fusion Module (FFM).\nFPEM is a cascadable U-shaped module, which can introduce multi-level\ninformation to guide the better segmentation. FFM can gather the features given\nby the FPEMs of different depths into a final feature for segmentation. The\nlearnable post-processing is implemented by Pixel Aggregation (PA), which can\nprecisely aggregate text pixels by predicted similarity vectors. Experiments on\nseveral standard benchmarks validate the superiority of the proposed PAN.

Because land planets can emit a large amount\nof radiation from the dry tropics, they have a higher runaway threshold than\naqua planets do. Here we systematically investigated the runaway threshold for\nvarious surface water distributions using a three-dimensional dynamic\natmosphere model. The runaway threshold for the meridionally uniform surface\nwater distribution increases from the typical value for the aqua-planet regime\n(~130% S0) to one for the land-planet regime (~155% S0) as the dry surface area\nincreases, where S0 is the present Earth's insolation. Although this result is\nsimilar to the previous work considering zonally uniform surface water\ndistributions, the runaway threshold for the land-planet regime is quite low\ncompared to that of the previous work. This is because a part of the tropical\natmosphere is always wet for the meridionally uniform case. We also considered\nthe surface water distributions determined by the Earth's, Mars' and Venus'\ntopographies. We found that their runaway thresholds are close to that for the\nmeridionally uniform cases, and the amount of water at the boundary between an\naqua- and land-planet regime is around 10% of the Earth's ocean.

In light of this, we\npropose a novel graph structure, \\emph{attribute network}, based on both items'\nco-purchase network and important attributes. A novel neural model called\n\\emph{eRAN} is then proposed to generate recommendations from attribute\nnetworks with explainability and cold-start capability.

Moreover, a pairwise ranking loss is constructed\ninto eRAN to improve recommendations, with the assumption that item pairs\nco-purchased by a user should be more similar than those non-paired with\nnegative sampling in personalized view. Experiments on real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with some state-of-the-art\ncompetitors.

The second session provided the service\nperspective, addressing experiences in forecasting development and operations.\nPresentations in both sessions provided an overview of international efforts on\nthese topics, and panel discussion topics arising in the first session were\nused as a basis for panel discussion in the second session. Discussion topics\nincluded experiences during the September 2017 space weather events, cross\ndomain impacts, timeliness of notifications, and provision of effective user\neducation. Users highlighted that a 'severe' space weather event did not\nnecessarily lead to severe impacts for each individual user across the\ndifferent sectors. Service providers were generally confident that timely and\nreliable information could be provided during severe and extreme events,\nalthough stressed that more research and funding were required in this\nrelatively new field of operational space weather forecasting, to ensure\ncontinuation of capabilities and further development of services, in particular\nimproved forecasting targeting user needs.

Inquiry In highly available, high-throughput systems, such\nas large banking infrastructure, however, 2PL becomes a bottleneck when objects\nare highly contended, when an object is queuing a lot of messages because of\nlocking.\n  Approach: In this paper we introduce Path-Sensitive Atomic Commit (PSAC) to\naddress this situation. We start from message handlers (or methods), which are\ndecorated with pre- and post-conditions, describing their guards and effect.\n  Knowledge: This allows the PSAC lock mechanism to check whether the effect of\ntwo incoming messages at the same time are independent, and to avoid locking if\nthis is the case. As a result, more messages are directly accepted or rejected,\nand higher overall throughput is obtained.\n  Grounding: We have implemented PSAC for a state machine-based DSL called\nRebel, on top of a runtime based on the Akka actor framework. Our performance\nevaluation shows that PSAC exhibits the same scalability and latency\ncharacteristics as standard 2PL/2PC, and obtains up to 1.8 times median higher\nthroughput in congested scenarios.\n  Importance: We believe PSAC is a step towards enabling organizations to build\nscalable distributed applications, even if their consistency requirements are\nnot embarrassingly parallel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 11:52:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 18:30:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

The high statistics of muons enables GRAPES-3 to make precise\nmeasurement of various sun-induced phenomenon including coronal mass ejections\n(CME), Forbush decreases, geomagnetic storms (GMS) and atmosphere acceleration\nduring the overhead passage of thunderclouds. However, the understanding and\ninterpretation of observed data requires Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of PCRs\nand subsequent development of showers in the atmosphere. CORSIKA is a standard\nMC simulation code widely used for this purpose. However, these simulations are\ntime consuming as large number of interactions and decays need to be taken into\naccount at various stages of shower development from top of the atmosphere down\nto ground level. Therefore, computing resources become an important\nconsideration particularly when billion of PCRs need to be simulated to match\nthe high statistical accuracy of the data. During the GRAPES-3 simulations, it\nwas observed that over 60% of simulated events don't really reach the Earth's\natmosphere. The geomagnetic field (GMF) creates a threshold to PCRs called\ncutoff rigidity Rc, a direction dependent parameter below which PCRs can't\nreach the Earth's atmosphere. However, in CORSIKA there is no provision to set\na direction dependent threshold. We have devised an efficient method that has\ntaken into account of this Rc dependence. A reduction by a factor ~3 in\nsimulation time and ~2 in output data size was achieved for GRAPES-3\nsimulations.

In 1991\nArnoux and Rauzy observed that an induction process (invented by Rauzy in the\nlate 1970s), related with the classical continued fraction algorithm, can be\nused to give a very elegant proof of this correspondence. This process, known\nas the Rauzy induction, extends naturally to interval exchange transformations\n(this is the setting in which it was first formalized). It has been conjectured\nsince the early 1990s that these correspondences carry over to rotations on\nhigher dimensional tori, generalized continued fraction algorithms, and\nso-called $S$-adic sequences generated by substitutions. The idea of working\ntowards such a generalization is known as Rauzy's program. Recently Berth\\'e,\nSteiner, and Thuswaldner made some progress on Rauzy's program and were indeed\nable to set up the conjectured generalization of the above correspondences.\nUsing a generalization of Rauzy's induction process in which generalized\ncontinued fraction algorithms show up, they proved that under certain natural\nconditions an $S$-adic sequence gives rise to a dynamical system which is\nmeasurably conjugate to a rotation on a higher dimensional torus. Moreover,\nthey established a metric theory which shows that counterexamples like the one\nconstructed in 2000 by Cassaigne, Ferenczi, and Zamboni are rare. It is the aim\nof the present chapter to survey all these ideas and results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 12:54:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 13:51:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2020 16:05:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

The decision to\nprogress to the confirmatory trial is typically made by comparing these\nestimates to pre-specified thresholds known as progression criteria, although\nthe statistical properties of such decision rules are rarely assessed. Such\nassessment is complicated by several methodological challenges, including the\nsimultaneous evaluation of multiple endpoints, complex multi-level models,\nsmall sample sizes, and uncertainty in nuisance parameters. In response to\nthese challenges, we describe a Bayesian approach to the design and analysis of\nexternal pilot trials. We show how progression decisions can be made by\nminimising the expected value of a loss function, defined over the whole\nparameter space to allow for preferences and trade-offs between multiple\nparameters to be articulated and used in the decision making process. The\nassessment of preferences is kept feasible by using a piecewise constant\nparameterisation of the loss function, the parameters of which are chosen at\nthe design stage to lead to desirable operating characteristics.

To our surprise, in numerical time evolutions we find\nthat, for sufficiently good fine-tuning, the scalar field always dominates on\nsufficiently small scales. We explain our results by the conjectured existence\nof a \"quasi-discretely self-similar\" (QSS) solution shared by the two fields,\nequal to the known Yang-Mills critical solution at infinitely large scales and\nthe known scalar field critical solution (the Choptuik solution) at infinitely\nsmall scales, with a gradual transition from one field to the other. This QSS\nsolution itself has only one unstable mode, and so acts as the critical\nsolution for any mixture of scalar field and Yang-Mills initial data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 13:47:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 21:02:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

In addition, we establish that within these\nPr$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$MgIrO$_6$ double perovskites, changes in Ir-oxidation states\n(4+ for PMIO to 5+ for PSMIO via mixed 4+/5+ for PSMIO1505) lead to markedly\ndifferent magnetic behaviors. While SOC on Ir is at the root of the observed\ninsulating behaviors for all three samples, the correlated magnetic properties\nof these three compounds develop entirely due to the contribution from local Ir\nmoments. Additionally, the magnetic Pr$^{3+}$ (4$f^2$) ions, instead of showing\nany kind of ordering, only contribute to the total paramagnetic moment. It is\nseen that the PrSrMgIrO$_6$ sample does not order down to 2 K despite\nantiferromagnetic interactions. But, the $d^5$ iridate Pr$_2$MgIrO$_6$ shows a\nsharp antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at around 14 K, and in the mixed\nvalent Pr$_{1.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$MgIrO$_6$ sample the AFM transition is shifted to a\nmuch lower temperature ($\\sim$ 6 K) due to weakening of the AFM exchange.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 13:50:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

In binary classification this shows the precise weight that each input\ncontributes towards the logit. The nomogram is a graphical representation of\nthese weights. We show that functions of individual and pairs of variables can\nbe derived from a functional Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) representation,\nenabling an efficient feature selection to be carried by application of the\nlogistic Lasso. This process infers the structure of GANNs which otherwise\nneeds to be predefined.

This has the\nfurther advantage that the resulting GANN can be replicated as a SENN, enabling\nfurther refinement of the univariate and bivariate component functions to take\nplace. The component functions are partial responses hence the SENN is a\npartial response network. The Partial Response Network (PRN) is equally as\ntransparent as a traditional logistic regression model, but capable of\nnon-linear classification with comparable or superior performance to the\noriginal MLP.

The notion \"safe\" means that\nthe objective function $f(x)$ during optimization should not violate a \"safety\"\nthreshold, for instance, a certain a priori given value $h$ in a maximization\nproblem. Thus, any new function evaluation (possibly corrupted by noise) must\nbe performed at \"safe points\" only, namely, at points $y$ for which it is known\nthat the objective function $f(y) > h$. The main difficulty here consists in\nthe fact that the used optimization algorithm should ensure that the safety\nconstraint will be satisfied at a point $y$ before evaluation of $f(y)$ will be\nexecuted. Thus, it is required both to determine the safe region $\\Omega$\nwithin the search domain~$D$ and to find the global maximum within $\\Omega$. An\nadditional difficulty consists in the fact that these problems should be solved\nin the presence of the noise. This paper starts with a theoretical study of the\nproblem and it is shown that even though the objective function $f(x)$\nsatisfies the Lipschitz condition, traditional Lipschitz minorants and\nmajorants cannot be used due to the presence of the noise. Then, a\n$\\delta$-Lipschitz framework and two algorithms using it are proposed to solve\nthe safe global maximization problem. The first method determines the safe area\nwithin the search domain and the second one executes the global maximization\nover the found safe region. For both methods a number of theoretical results\nrelated to their functioning and convergence is established. Finally, numerical\nexperiments confirming the reliability of the proposed procedures are\nperformed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 16:20:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 14:31:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

Even when we are confronted with a general\nscene-motion, the fundamental matrix approach as a model for motion\nsegmentation still suffers from several defects, which we discuss in this\npaper. The full potential of the fundamental matrix approach could only be\nrealized if we judiciously harness information from the simpler homography\nmodel. From these considerations, we propose a multi-model spectral clustering\nframework that synergistically combines multiple models (homography and\nfundamental matrix) together. We show that the performance can be substantially\nimproved in this way. For general motion segmentation tasks, the number of\nindependently moving objects is often unknown a priori and needs to be\nestimated from the observations.

As the number of agents increases, nonstationarity gets more\nserious in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which brings great\ndifficulties to the learning process. Besides, current mainstream algorithms\nconfigure each agent an independent network,so that the memory usage increases\nlinearly with the number of agents which greatly slows down the interaction\nwith the environment. Inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), this\npaper proposes an iterative update method (IU) to stabilize the nonstationary\nenvironment. Further, we add first-person perspective and represent all agents\nby only one network which can change agents' policies from sequential compute\nto batch compute. Similar to continual lifelong learning, we realize the\niterative update method in this unified representative network (IUUR). In this\nmethod, iterative update can greatly alleviate the nonstationarity of the\nenvironment, unified representation can speed up the interaction with\nenvironment and avoid the linear growth of memory usage. Besides, this method\ndoes not bother decentralized execution and distributed deployment.

Modeling has been increasingly used to evaluate the\npotential impact of different control measures and to guide public health\npolicy decisions. In recent years, there has been rapid progress in developing\nspatio-temporal modeling of infectious diseases and an example of such recent\ndevelopments is the discrete time individual-level models (ILMs). These models\nare well developed and provide a common framework for modeling many disease\nsystems, however, they assume the probability of disease transmission between\ntwo individuals depends only on their spatial separation and not on their\nspatial locations. In cases where spatial location itself is important for\nunderstanding the spread of emerging infectious diseases and identifying their\ncauses, it would be beneficial to incorporate the effect of spatial location in\nthe model. In this study, we thus generalize the ILMs to a new class of\ngeographically-dependent ILMs (GD-ILMs), to allow for the evaluation of the\neffect of spatially varying risk factors (e.g., education, environmental), as\nwell as unobserved spatial structure, upon the transmission of infectious\ndisease. Specifically, we consider a conditional autoregressive model to\ncapture the effects of unobserved spatially structured latent covariates or\nmeasurement error. This results in flexible infectious disease models that can\nbe used for formulating etiological hypotheses and identifying geographical\nregions of unusually high risk to formulate preventive action. The reliability\nof these models are investigated on a combination of simulated epidemic data\nand Alberta seasonal influenza outbreak data (2009). This new class of models\nis fitted to data within a Bayesian statistical framework using MCMC methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 23:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

In this Part I, we derive in general terms the real-space\ncoordinate transformation to correct this shear, which originates in the more\nfundamental relationship between the representations of mutually conjugate 3D\nspaces. Such a transformation, applied as a final post-processing step\nfollowing phase retrieval, is crucial for arriving at an un-distorted and\nphysically meaningful image of the 3D scatterer. As the relevance of BCDI grows\nin the field of materials characterization, we take this opportunity to\ngeneralize the available sparse literature that addresses the geometric theory\nof BCDI and the subsequent analysis methods. This aspect, specific to coherent\nBragg diffraction and absent in two-dimensional transmission CDI experiments,\ngains particular importance concerning spatially-resolved characterization of\n3D crystalline materials in a realiable, non-destructive manner.

It is based on the measurement of a\nseries of coherent diffraction intensity patterns that are numerically inverted\nto retrieve an image of the spatial distribution of relative phase and\namplitude of the Bragg structure factor of the scatterer. This 3D information,\nwhich is collected through an angular rotation of the sample, is necessarily\nobtained in a non-orthogonal frame in Fourier space that must be eventually\nreconciled. To deal with this, the currently favored approach (detailed in Part\nI) is to perform the entire inversion in conjugate non-orthogonal real and\nFourier space frames, and to transform the 3D sample image into an orthogonal\nframe as a post-processing step for result analysis. In this article, a direct\nfollow-up of Part I, we demonstrate two different transformation strategies\nthat enable the entire inversion procedure of the measured data set to be\nperformed in an orthogonal frame. The new approaches described here build\nmathematical and numerical frameworks that apply to the cases of evenly and\nnon-evenly sampled data along the direction of sample rotation (the rocking\ncurve). The value of these methods is that they rely on and incorporate\nsignificantly more information about the experimental geometry into the design\nof the phase retrieval Fourier transformation than the strategy presented in\nPart I. Two important outcomes are 1) that the resulting sample image is\ncorrectly interpreted in a shear-free frame, and 2) physically realistic\nconstraints of BCDI phase retrieval that are difficult to implement with\ncurrent methods are easily incorporated.
