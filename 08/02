When the observations used are uncertain, however, KF suffers from\nconditional bias (CB) which results in consistent under- and overestimation of\nextremes in the right and left tails, respectively. Recently, CB-penalized KF,\nor CBPKF, has been developed to address CB. In this paper, we present an\nalternative formulation based on variance-inflated KF to reduce computation and\nalgorithmic complexity, and describe adaptive implementation to improve\nunconditional performance. For theoretical basis and context, we also provide a\ncomplete self-contained description of CB-penalized Fisher-like estimation and\nCBPKF. The results from 1-dimensional synthetic experiments for a linear system\nwith varying degrees of nonstationarity show that adaptive CBPKF reduces root\nmean square error at the extreme tail ends by 20 to 30% over KF while\nperforming comparably to KF in the unconditional sense. The alternative\nformulation is found to approximate the original formulation very closely while\nreducing computing time to 1.5 to 3.5 times of that for KF depending on the\ndimensionality of the problem.

Machine learning approaches are intensely being applied to this\nproblem due to their ability to classify seizure conditions from a large amount\nof data, and provide pre-screened results for neurologists. Several features,\ndata transformations, and classifiers have been explored to analyze and\nclassify seizures via EEG signals. In the literature, some jointly-applied\nfeatures used in the classification may have shared similar contributions,\nmaking them redundant in the learning process. Therefore, this paper aims to\ncomprehensively summarize feature descriptions and their interpretations in\ncharacterizing epileptic seizures using EEG signals, as well as to review\nclassification performance metrics. To provide meaningful information of\nfeature selection, we conducted an experiment to examine the quality of each\nfeature independently. The Bayesian error and non-parametric probability\ndistribution estimation were employed to determine the significance of the\nindividual features. Moreover, a redundancy analysis using a correlation-based\nfeature selection was applied. The results showed that the following features\n--variance, energy, nonlinear energy, and Shannon entropy computed on a raw EEG\nsignal, as well as variance, energy, kurtosis, and line length calculated on\nwavelet coefficients-- were able to significantly capture the seizures. An\nimprovement of 4.77--13.51% in the Bayesian error from the baseline was\nobtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 16:40:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-02"}

For a benchmark value of the dark matter\nmass $M_{\\rm DM} = 220\\,{\\rm TeV}$, we show the evolution of the abundance and\nhow this depends on reheat temperature, dark matter lifetime and source RH\nneutrino mass $M_{\\rm S}$, with the assumption $M_{\\rm S} < M_{\\rm DM}$. We\ncompare the results with those obtained within the Landau-Zener approximation,\nshowing that the latter largely overestimates the final abundance giving some\nanalytical insight. However, we also notice that since in the density matrix\nformalism the production is non-resonant, this allows source RH neutrino masses\nbelow the W boson mass, making dark matter more stable at large mass values.\nThis opens an allowed region for initial vanishing source RH neutrino\nabundance.

Methods. Angularly resolved common\nproper motion pairs were detected using a simple progressive selection\nalgorithm to separate the most probable candidate companions from the unrelated\nfield stars. Results. We found 27 resolved, high probability gravitationally\nbound systems with CCs out of 456 examined stars, and one unbound star embedded\nin the circumstellar dusty nebula of the long-period Cepheid RS Pup. We found\nseven spatially resolved, probably bound systems with RRL primaries out of 789\ninvestigated stars, and 22 additional candidate pairs.

The model\nrestricts the role of baryonic astrophysics to setting the relation between\ngalaxies and their haloes. Using this approach, galaxy properties can be\ndirectly predicted from the growth of their host dark matter haloes. We explore\nmodels in which the effective star formation efficiency within haloes is a\nfunction of mass (or virial temperature) and independent of time. Despite its\nsimplicity, the model reproduces self-consistently the shape and evolution of\nthe cosmic star formation rate density, the specific star formation rate of\ngalaxies, and the galaxy stellar mass function, both at the present time and at\nhigh redshifts. By systematically varying the effective star formation\nefficiency in the model, we explore the emergence of the characteristic shape\nof the galaxy stellar mass function. The origin of the observed double\nSchechter function at low redshifts is naturally explained by two efficiency\nregimes in the stellar to halo mass relation, namely, a stellar feedback\nregulated stage, and a supermassive black hole regulated stage.

In the second, the tensor factors are each\nisomorphic to the CoHAs of the corresponding Dynkin subquivers. When the quiver\nis already an orientation of a simply-laced Dynkin diagram, our results\ninterpolate between isomorphisms proved by Rimanyi. Such CoHA decompositions\nappear in prior work of Davison--Meinhardt and Franzen--Reineke, but our proof\ngives an explicit topological realization of these results. As a consequence of\nour method, we deduce that certain structure constants in the CoHA naturally\narise as CoHA products of classes of Dynkin quiver polynomials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 18:18:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 19:54:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 18:14:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

Appropriate analysis of scRNA-seq data\ncan characterize molecular heterogeneity and shed light into the underlying\ncellular process to better understand development and disease mechanisms. The\nunique analytic challenge is to appropriately model highly over-dispersed\nscRNA-seq count data with prevalent dropouts (zero counts), making\nzero-inflated dimensionality reduction techniques popular for scRNA-seq data\nanalyses.

Recently, these reactions have been applied to rare-isotope beams at\nintermediate energies in inverse kinematics to study the quenching of\nspectroscopic factors.\n  Purpose: Our goal is to investigate the effects of various corrections and\nuncertainties within the standard DWIA formalism on the $(p,pN)$ cross\nsections. The consistency of the extracted reduction factors between DWIA and\nother methods is also evaluated.\n  Method: We analyze the $(p,2p)$ and $(p,pn)$ reactions data measured at the\nR$^3$B/LAND setup at GSI for carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopes in the\nincident energy range of 300--450 MeV/u.

To this end, we\nfirst construct a synthetic dataset with carefully designed low-light\nsimulation strategies. The dataset is much larger and more diverse than\nexisting ones.

Prior research on this problem assumes the dominance of\nthe trigger in an image's representation, which causes any image with the\ntrigger to be recognized as a member in the target class. Such a trigger also\nexhibits unique features in the representation space and can therefore be\neasily separated from legitimate images. Our research, however, shows that\nsimple target contamination can cause the representation of an attack image to\nbe less distinguishable from that of legitimate ones, thereby evading existing\ndefenses against the backdoor infection.\n  In our research, we show that such a contamination attack actually subtly\nchanges the representation distribution for the target class, which can be\ncaptured by a statistic analysis. More specifically, we leverage an EM\nalgorithm to decompose an image into its identity part (e.g., person, traffic\nsign) and variation part within a class (e.g., lighting, poses). Then we\nanalyze the distribution in each class, identifying those more likely to be\ncharacterized by a mixture model resulted from adding attack samples to the\nlegitimate image pool.

In this paper, we\nstudy the tradeoffs between efficiency and fairness in operating a shared\nbattery. We develop a framework based on constrained Markov decision processes\nto study both regimes, namely, optimizing efficiency under a hard fairness\nconstraint and optimizing fairness under hard efficiency constraint. Our\nresults show that there are fundamental limits to efficiency under fairness and\nvice-versa, and, in general, the two cannot be achieved simultaneously.

In contrast, more advanced approaches inspired by the recent success of\ndeep learning often lack seamless interpretability of the detected results. To\novercome this challenge, we propose the application of adversarial autoencoder\nnetworks. We demonstrate that such artificial neural networks are capable of\nlearning a semantic meaningful representation of real-world journal entries.\nThe learned representation provides a holistic view on a given set of journal\nentries and significantly improves the interpretability of detected accounting\nanomalies. We show that such a representation combined with the networks\nreconstruction error can be utilized as an unsupervised and highly adaptive\nanomaly assessment. Experiments on two datasets and initial feedback received\nby forensic accountants underpinned the effectiveness of the approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 07:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-05"}

However, dealing fully with three-nucleon, possibly\nfour-nucleon, interactions makes the solving of the A-body Schr\\\"odinger\nequation particularly cumbersome, if not impossible beyond a certain nuclear\nmass. Consequently, ab initio calculations of mid-mass nuclei are typically\nperformed on the basis of the normal-ordered two-body (NO2B) approximation that\ncaptures dominant effects of three-nucleon forces while effectively working\nwith two-nucleon operators. A powerful idea currently employed to extend ab\ninitio calculations to open-shell nuclei consists of expanding the exact\nsolution of the A-body Schr\\\"odinger equation while authorizing the approximate\nsolution to break symmetries of the Hamiltonian. In this context, operators are\nnormal ordered with respect to a symmetry-breaking reference state such that\nproceeding to a naive truncation may lead to symmetry-breaking approximate\noperators. The purpose of the present work is to design a normal-ordering\napproximation of operators that is consistent with the symmetries of the\nHamiltonian while working in the context of symmetry broken (and potentially\nrestored) methods. Focusing on many-body formalisms in which U(1) global-gauge\nsymmetry associated with particle number conservation is broken (and\npotentially restored), a particle-number-conserving normal-ordered k-body\n(PNOkB) approximation of an arbitrary N-body operator is designed on the basis\nof Bogoliubov reference states. A numerical test based on particle-number\nprojected Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations permits to check the\nparticle-number conserving/violating character of a given approximation to a\nparticle-number conserving operator. Using the presently proposed PNOkB\napproximation, ab initio calculations based on symmetry-breaking and restored\nformalisms can be safely performed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 09:06:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

We achieve high photo-z precision\n($\\sigma_{\\Delta z/(1+z_{spec})}\\lesssim0.04$), high accuracy (i.e., minimal\noffset biases; median$(\\Delta z/(1+z_{spec}))\\lesssim0.02$), and low\ncatastrophic failure rates ($\\eta\\simeq4\\%$) over all redshifts. Interestingly,\nwe find that a weak 2175A absorption feature in the attenuation curve models is\nrequired to remove a subtle systematic photo-z offset\n($z_{phot}-z_{spec}\\simeq-0.03$) that occurs when this feature is not included.\nAs expected, the accuracy of derived physical properties in MAGPHYS+photo-z\ndecreases strongly as redshift uncertainty increases. The all-in-one treatment\nof uncertainties afforded with this code is beneficial for accurately\ninterpreting physical properties of galaxies in large photometric datasets.\nFinally, we emphasize that MAGPHYS+photo-z is not intended to replace existing\nphoto-z codes, but rather offer flexibility to robustly interpret physical\nproperties when spectroscopic redshifts are unavailable. The MAGPHYS+photo-z\ncode is publicly available online.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 09:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

The adjective `proper' alludes to the feature\nthat equivalences are tested on compact subgroups, and that the objects are\nbuilt from equivariant cells with compact isotropy groups; the adjective\n`genuine' indicates that the theory comes with appropriate transfers and\nWirthm\\\"uller isomorphisms, and the resulting equivariant cohomology theories\nsupport the analog of an $RO(G)$-grading.\n  Our model for genuine proper $G$-equivariant stable homotopy theory is the\ncategory of orthogonal $G$-spectra; the equivalences are those morphisms that\ninduce isomorphisms of equivariant stable homotopy groups for all compact\nsubgroups of $G$. This class of $\\pi_*$-isomorphisms is part of a symmetric\nmonoidal stable model structure and the associated tensor triangulated homotopy\ncategory is compactly generated. Every orthogonal $G$-spectrum represents an\nequivariant cohomology theory on the category of $G$-spaces, depending only on\nthe `proper $G$-homotopy type', tested by fixed points under all compact\nsubgroups.\n  An important special case are infinite discrete groups. For these, our\ngenuine equivariant theory is related to finiteness properties, in the sense of\ngeometric group theory; for example, the $G$-sphere spectrum is a compact\nobject in the equivariant homotopy category if the universal space for proper\n$G$-actions has a finite $G$-CW-model. For discrete groups, the represented\nequivariant cohomology theories on finite proper $G$-CW-complexes admit a more\nexplicit description in terms of parameterized equivariant homotopy theory,\nsuitably stabilized by $G$-vector bundles. Via this description, we can\nidentify the previously defined $G$-cohomology theories of equivariant stable\ncohomotopy and equivariant K-theory as cohomology theories represented by\nspecific orthogonal $G$-spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 09:53:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 09:20:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-15"}

The configuration of these\nmultibead chains can be described by a distribution function that evolves\naccording to a Liouville or Fokker--Planck equation. For example, when we\nconsider a suspension of Hookean bead-spring pairs, this approach leads to the\nwell-known upper-convected Maxwell model. This is done by taking the second\nmoment of the Fokker--Planck equation that governs the distribution function,\nwhich describes the stress of the bead-spring pairs on the fluid. The evolution\nof these multibead-chain suspensions can be described using a double bracket\nformulation with a Hamiltonian functional. The conservative part of the\ndynamics is described by a Poisson bracket, and the dissipative part by an\nadditional symmetric bracket. We treat the configuration space of multibead\nchains as a higher order tangent bundle. Lifting the fluid velocity field to\nthe bundle leads naturally to a semidirect product Lie--Poisson bracket for the\nconservative dynamics. The elastic stress exerted by the chains then follows\ndirectly from the Hamiltonian functional. For chains with three or more beads,\nthe possible bending of the chain introduces an angular momentum flux that is\nabsent for chains with two beads. This flux appear as an asymmetric elastic\nstress whose antisymmetric part is the divergence of a rank-$3$ tensor, as in\nthe Cosserats' theory of couple stresses. We investigate the possibility of an\nexact closure, passing from a distribution function description to a closed\ninternal state variable description of the fluid suspension, and obtain some\nsufficient conditions for their existence. The resulting exactly closable\nmodels are generalisations of the upper-convected Maxwell model to Hookean\nbead-spring chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 10:55:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 16:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

The enthalpy of formation of the biomass is\nestimated through a direct correlation based on ultimate and proximate\nanalysis, whose parameters can easily be fitted with experimental data\navailable from sources such as the Phillys database for different biomass types\nand implemented in process simulators such as Aspen Plus.

We propose to use deep neural networks as precoders for\ncurrent and future video codecs and adaptive video streaming systems.

We show for the isovolume series\nCe$_3$Bi$_4$(Pt$_{1-x}$Pd$_x$)$_3$ that the Kondo coupling is in fact\nsubstantially modified by the different radial extent of the $5d$ (Pt) and $4d$\n(Pd) orbitals, while spin-orbit coupling mediated changes are minute. Combining\nexperimental Kondo temperatures with simulated hybridization functions, we also\npredict effective masses $m^*$, finding excellent agreement with many-body\nresults for Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pt$_3$. Our analysis motivates studying the so-far\nunknown Kondo insulator Ce$_3$Sb$_4$Pd$_3$, for which we predict\n$m^*/m_{band}=\\mathcal{O}(10)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 13:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

The loss from hand blockage on the antenna gains can be up to 20-25\ndB, which implies that the possible hand grip profiles need to be taken into\naccount while designing beam codebooks. Specifically, we consider three\ndifferent codebook adaption schemes: a grip-aware scheme, where perfect\nknowledge of the hand grip is available; a semi-aware scheme, where just the\napplication (voice call, messaging, etc.) and the orientation of the mobile\nhandset is known; and a grip-agnostic scheme, where the codebook ignores hand\nblockage.

The key idea is to first identify sets of assignments which fall in\nthe same symmetry class, and then impose ordering constraints, called Symmetry\nBreaking Predicates (SBPs), such that only one (or a small subset) of these\nassignments is allowed to be a solution of the original SAT formula. While this\ntechnique has been exploited extensively in the SAT literature, there is little\nwork on using symmetry breaking for SAT Modulo Theories (SMT). In SMT, logical\nconstraints in SAT theories are combined with another set of theory operations\ndefined over non-Boolean variables such as integers, reals, etc. SMT solvers\ntypically use a combination of SAT solving techniques augmented with calls to\nthe theory solver. In this work, we take up the advances in SAT symmetry\nbreaking and apply them to the domain of SMT. Our key technical contribution is\nthe formulation of symmetry breaking over the Boolean skeleton variables, which\nare placeholders for actual theory operations in SMT solving. These SBPs are\nthen applied over the SAT solving part of the SMT solver. We implement our SBP\nideas on top of CVC4, which is a state-of-the-art SMT solver.

In\nreal-world applications, the intra-camera label information can be easily\ncaptured by tracking algorithms or few manual annotations.

It also has a long history in physics, ranging from the\nminimal action principle to finding ground states of disordered systems such as\nspin glasses. Proximal algorithms form a class of methods that are broadly\napplicable and are particularly well-suited to nonsmooth, constrained,\nlarge-scale, and distributed optimization problems. There are essentially five\nproximal algorithms currently known: Forward-backward splitting, Tseng\nsplitting, Douglas-Rachford, alternating direction method of multipliers, and\nthe more recent Davis-Yin. These methods sit on a higher level of abstraction\ncompared to gradient-based ones, with deep roots in nonlinear functional\nanalysis. We show that all of these methods are actually different\ndiscretizations of a single differential equation, namely, the simple gradient\nflow which dates back to Cauchy (1847). An important aspect behind many of the\nsuccess stories in machine learning relies on \"accelerating\" the convergence of\nfirst-order methods. We show that similar discretization schemes applied to\nNewton's equation with an additional dissipative force, which we refer to as\naccelerated gradient flow, allow us to obtain accelerated variants of all these\nproximal algorithms -- the majority of which are new although some recover\nknown cases in the literature. Furthermore, we extend these methods to\nstochastic settings, allowing us to make connections with Langevin and\nFokker-Planck equations. Similar ideas apply to gradient descent, heavy ball,\nand Nesterov's method which are simpler. Our results therefore provide a\nunified framework from which several important optimization methods are nothing\nbut simulations of classical dissipative systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 14:01:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 15:10:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 20:54:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 17:10:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 16:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

The novelty of our model is in considering the case where the\nreceivers interact in a sequential game with imperfect information, with\nutilities depending on the game outcome and the realized action types. After\nformalizing the notions of ex ante and ex interim persuasiveness (which differ\nin the time at which the receivers commit to following the sender's signaling\nscheme), we investigate the continuous optimization problem of computing a\nsignaling scheme which maximizes the sender's expected revenue.

An application expert that wants to simulate a PDE-governed\nproblem has to extend the framework with a description of the weak form of the\nPDE at hand (and additional perturbation terms for non-conforming\napproximations). We show how to use the library by going through three\ndifferent tutorials. The first tutorial simulates a linear PDE (Poisson\nequation) in a serial environment for a structured mesh using both continuous\nand discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods. The second tutorial extends\nit with adaptive mesh refinement on octree meshes.

Previous studies show that the growth will be inside-out, but it is\nstill common practice to assume that the entire inner disk will eventually\nreach a bi-modal distribution of embryos and planetesimals. For the\ncombinations of disk mass, initial planetesimal radius and gas disk lifetime\nexplored in this work the entire disk never reaches a simple bi-modal mass\ndistribution. We find that the inside-out growth is amplified by the combined\neffects of collisional evolution of solid bodies and interactions with a\ndissipating gas disk. This leads to oligarchic growth never being achieved in\ndifferent places of the disk at the same time, where in some cases the disk can\nsimultaneoulsy support chaotic growth and giant impacts inside 1 au and runaway\ngrowth beyond 2 au. The planetesimal population is efficiently depleted in the\ninner disk where embryo growth primarily advances in the presence of a\nsignificant gas disk. Further out in the disk growth is slower relative to the\ngas disk dissipation, resulting in more excited planetesimals at the same stage\nof growth and less efficient accretion. This same effect drives mass loss due\nto collisional grinding strongly altering the surface density of the accreted\nplanets relative to the initial mass distribution. This effect decreases the\nMars-to-Earth mass ratios compared to previous works with no collisional\ngrinding. Similar to some previous findings utilizing vastly different growth\nscenarios these simulations produce a first generation of planetary embryos\nthat are stable for 10-20 Myr, or 5-10 e-folding times of the gas dissipation\ntimescale, before having an instability and entering the chaotic growth stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 15:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-05"}

Near the parameter region of zero-temperature valence\ntransition, rise of temperature can generate a thermal valence transition from\nmixed valence to Kondo region, accompanied by a first-order topological\ntransition. Remarkably, above a critical $U_{fc}$ which is considerable smaller\nthan that generating paramagnetic valence transition, the original continuous\nantiferromagnetic transition is shifted to first order one, at which a\ndiscontinuous valence shift takes place.

The continuous antiferromagnetic transition, first-order\nantiferromagnetic transition, paramagnetic valence transition and topological\ntransitions are all summarized in a global phase diagram.

Density functional theory (DFT), the most widely used\nquantum chemical method, is a physical approach predicting energies and\nelectron densities of molecules. Recently, numerous papers on machine learning\n(ML) of molecular properties have also been published. ML models greatly\noutperform DFT in terms of computational costs, and may even reach comparable\naccuracy, but they are missing physicality - a direct link to Quantum Physics -\nwhich limits their applicability.

Based on these equations, we build a deep neural\nnetwork that can compute electron densities and energies of a wide range of\norganic molecules not only much faster, but also closer to exact physical\nvalues than current versions of DFT. In particular, we reached a mean absolute\nerror in energies of molecules with up to eight non-hydrogen atoms as low as\n0.9 kcal/mol relative to CCSD(T) values, noticeably lower than those of DFT\n(down to ~3 kcal/mol on the same set of molecules) and ML (down to ~1.5\nkcal/mol) methods.

The conditions\ntypically reflect the selection of a set of node signals that are taken as\npredictor inputs in a MISO identification setup. In this paper an extension is\nmade to arrive at an identification setup for the situation that process noises\non the different node signals can be correlated with each other.

The characteristics of NVM devices,\nhowever, tend to be fundamentally different from those of DRAM (i.e., the\nmemory device currently used for main memory), because of differences in\nprinciples of memory cells. Typically, the write latency of an NVM device such\nas PCM and ReRAM is much higher than its read latency. The asymmetry in\nread/write latencies likely affects the performance of applications\nsignificantly. For analyzing behavior of applications running on NVM-based main\nmemory, most researchers use software-based emulation tools due to the limited\nnumber of commercial NVM products. However, these existing emulation tools are\ntoo slow to emulate a large-scale, realistic workload or too simplistic to\ninvestigate the details of application behavior on NVM with asymmetric\nread/write latencies. This paper therefore proposes a new NVM emulation\nmechanism that is not only light-weight but also aware of a read/write latency\ngap in NVM-based main memory. We implemented the prototype of the proposed\nmechanism for the Intel CPU processors of the Haswell architecture. We also\nevaluated its accuracy and performed case studies for practical benchmarks. The\nresults showed that our prototype accurately emulated write-latencies of\nNVM-based main memory: it emulated the NVM write latencies in a range from 200\nns to 1000 ns with negligible errors from 0.2% to 1.1%. We confirmed that the\nuse of our emulator enabled us to successfully estimate performance of\npractical workloads for NVM-based main memory, while an existing light-weight\nemulation model misestimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 04:37:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}
