We need to understand how the Sun creates the heliosphere, and\nhow the planets interact with the solar wind and its magnetic field, not just\nas a matter of scientific curiosity, but to address a clear and pressing\npractical problem: space weather, which can influence the performance and\nreliability of our technological systems, in space and on the ground, and can\nendanger human life and health.\n  Much knowledge has already been acquired over the past decades, but the\ninfant stage of space weather forecasting demonstrates that we still have a\nvast amount of learning to do. We can tackle this issue in two ways: 1) By\nusing multiple spacecraft measuring conditions in situ in the magnetosphere in\norder to make sense of the fundamental small scale processes that enable\ntransport and coupling, or 2) By taking a global approach to observations of\nthe conditions that prevail throughout geospace in order to quantify the global\neffects of external drivers.\n  A global approach is now being taken by a number of space missions under\ndevelopment and the first tantalising results of their exploration will be\navailable in the next decade. Here we propose the next step-up in the quest for\na complete understanding of how the Sun gives rise to and controls the Earth's\nplasma environment: a tomographic imaging approach comprising two spacecraft\nwhich enable global imaging of magnetopause and cusps, auroral regions,\nplasmasphere and ring current, alongside in situ measurements. Such a mission\nis going to be crucial on the way to achieve scientific closure on the question\nof solar-terrestrial interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 16:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

The GW170817 event together with the short gamma-ray\nburst GRB 170817A was the first-ever detection of the gravitational waves and\nan electromagnetic counterpart. These detections encourage us to think that in\nthe following years we will detect a single event through three different\nchannels: including the mentioned above plus neutrinos from multiple\nastrophysical sources, like those detected from SN1987A. It is believed that\nshort GRBs are originated in the merger of a black-hole (BH) with a neutron\nstar (NS) or NS-NS scenario. Particularly only in the latter case, several\nsimulations suggest that the magnetic field can be amplified up to $10^{16}$ G.\nConsidering this effect over created thermal neutrinos during the initial\nstage, we could differentiate short GRB progenitors through the neutrino\nexpected flavor ratio and the opacity created by the baryon-loaded winds\nejected in each scenario. Moreover, We find that it is more feasible to detect\nneutrinos from BH-NS than NS-NS systems.

MMR can allow planets to remain stable in regions of phase space\nwhere strong planet-planet interactions would otherwise destabilize the system.\nThese stable orbits can occupy small phase space volumes, allowing MMRs to\nstrongly constrain system parameters, but making searches for stable orbital\nparameters challenging. Furthermore, libration of the resonant angle and\ndynamical interaction between the planets introduces another, long period\nvariation into the observed RV signal, complicating analysis of the periods of\nthe planets in the system. We discuss this phenomenon using the example of HD\n200964. By searching through parameter space and numerically integrating each\nproposed set of planetary parameters to test for long term stability, we find\nstable solutions in the 7:5 and 3:2 MMRs in addition to the originally\nidentified 4:3 MMR. The 7:5 configuration provides the best match to the data,\nwhile the 3:2 configuration provides the most easily understood formation\nscenario. In reanalysis of the originally published shorter-baseline data, we\nfind fits in both the 4:3 and 3:2 resonances, but not the 7:5. Because the time\nbaseline of the data is less than the resonant libration period, the current\nbest fit to the data may not reflect the actual resonant configuration. In the\nabsence of a full sample of the longer libration period, we find that it is of\nparamount importance to incorporate long term stability when fitting for the\nsystem's orbital configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

In each case, we identify a\ncritical zero-sound mode, whose velocity vanishes at the Pomeranchuk\ninstability. For $F_l^{c(s)} < -1$, this mode is located in the upper frequency\nhalf-plane, which signals an instability of the ground state. In a clean Fermi\nliquid the critical mode may be either purely relaxational or almost\npropagating, depending on the parity of $l$ and on whether the response\nfunction is longitudinal or transverse. These differences lead to qualitatively\ndifferent types of time evolution of the order parameter following an initial\nperturbation. A special situation occurs for the $l = 1$ order parameter that\ncoincides with the spin or charge current. In this case the residue of the\ncritical mode vanishes at the Pomeranchuk transition.

Beyond\ngathering and organizing a large majority of the material on missing data\n(bibliography, courses, tutorials, implementations), \"R-miss-tastic\" covers the\ndevelopment of standardized analysis workflows. Indeed, we have developed\nseveral pipelines in R and Python to allow for hands-on illustration of and\nrecommendations on missing values handling in various statistical tasks such as\nmatrix completion, estimation and prediction, while ensuring reproducibility of\nthe analyses. Finally, the platform is dedicated to users who analyze\nincomplete data, researchers who want to compare their methods and search for\nan up-to-date bibliography, and also teachers who are looking for didactic\nmaterials (notebooks, video, slides).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 18:52:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 14:06:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 18:51:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

We consider this at different\nextents of the driving force, which here is the extent of supersaturation, and\ncalculate a reaction coordinate (RC) for nucleation as the driving force is\nvaried. The RC is constructed as a linear combination of three order\nparameters, where one accounts for the number of liquid-like atoms, and the\nother two for local density fluctuations. The RC is calculated from all-atom\nbiased and unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the spectral gap\noptimization approach \"SGOOP\" [P. Tiwary and B. J. Berne, Proc. Natl. Acad.\nSci. U. S. A. 113, 2839 (2016)]. Our key finding is that as the supersaturation\ndecreases, the RC ceases to simply be the number of liquid-like atoms, and\ninstead it becomes important to explicitly consider local density fluctuations\nthat correlate with shape and density variations in the nucleus. All three\norder parameters are found to have similar barriers in their respective\npotentials of mean force, however, as the supersaturation decreases the density\nfluctuations decorrelate slower and thus carry longer memory. Thus at lower\nsupersaturations density fluctuations are non-Markovian and can not be simply\nignored from the RC by virtue of being noise. Finally, we use this optimized RC\nto calculate nucleation rates in the infrequent metadynamics framework, and\nshow it leads to more accurate estimate of the nucleation rate with four orders\nof magnitude acceleration relative to unbiased MD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 20:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

To maximize\nthe weighted sum rate (WSR) of IRs, the transmit precoding (TPC) matrices of\nthe BS and passive phase shift matrix of the IRS should be jointly optimized.\nTo tackle this challenging optimization problem, we first adopt the classic\nblock coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm for decoupling the original\noptimization problem into several subproblems and alternatively optimize the\nTPC matrices and the phase shift matrix. For each subproblem, we provide a\nlow-complexity iterative algorithm, which is guaranteed to converge to the\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of each subproblem. The BCD algorithm is\nrigorously proved to converge to the KKT point of the original problem. We also\nconceive a feasibility checking method to study its feasibility. Our extensive\nsimulation results confirm that employing IRSs in SWIPT beneficially enhances\nthe system performance and the proposed BCD algorithm converges rapidly, which\nis appealing for practical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 21:07:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 22:51:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 20:14:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 16:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Thermoelectric nanoscale heat engines convert heat flows into\nuseful work in the form of electrical power and promise the realization of\non-chip power production. Considerable studies have so far revealed the\npotentials to yield an enhanced efficiency originating from quantum confinement\neffects and energy-dependent transport properties. However, the full benefit of\nmany-body interactions in thermoelectric is yet to be investigated; identifying\nthe optimal interaction is a hard problem due to combinatorial explosion of the\nsearch space, which makes brute-force searches infeasible. Here we tackle this\nproblem with reinforcement learning of network topology in interacting\nelectronic systems, and identify a set of the best thermoelectric nanoscale\nengines. Harnessing many-body interactions, we show that the maximum possible\nvalues of the thermoelectric figure of merit and the power factor can be\nenhanced by orders of magnitudes for generic single-electron levels. This\nallows for simple and flexible design of realizing the asymptotic Carnot\nefficiency with subextensive, but still nonzero and stable power. To realize\nthe optimal nanoscale engines, we propose concrete physical setups based on\nquantum-dot arrays.

Audits can reveal fraudulent\n(or simply careless) policyholders not following reported security procedures,\nin which case the insurer can refuse to indemnify the policyholder. However,\nthe insurer has to bear an audit cost even when the policyholders have followed\nthe prescribed security procedures. As audits can be expensive, a key problem\ninsurers face is to devise an auditing strategy to deter policyholders from\nmisrepresenting their security levels to gain a premium discount. This\ndecision-making problem was motivated by conducting interviews with\nunderwriters and reviewing regulatory filings in the U.S.; we discovered that\npremiums are determined by security posture, yet this is often self-reported\nand insurers are concerned by whether security procedures are practised as\nreported by the policyholders.\n  To address this problem, we model this interaction as a Bayesian game of\nincomplete information and devise optimal auditing strategies for the insurers\nconsidering the possibility that the policyholder may misrepresent her security\nlevel. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first theoretical\nconsideration of post-incident claims management in cyber security. Our model\ncaptures the trade-off between the incentive to exaggerate security posture\nduring the application process and the possibility of punishment for\nnon-compliance with reported security policies. Simulations demonstrate that\ncommon sense techniques are not as efficient at providing effective cyber\ninsurance audit decisions as the ones computed using game theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 21:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

Our main focus is the unexpected temperature dependence of\nthe excitations at the $M$ point. These have been identified as having $xz$ and\n$yz$ orbital character well below $T_{{\\rm nem}}$, but remain split at\n$T>T_{{\\rm nem}}$, in apparent contradiction to the fact that in the tetragonal\nphase the $xz$ and $yz$ orbitals are degenerate. Here we present two scenarios\nwhich can describe the data. In both scenarios, hybridization terms present in\nthe tetragonal phase leads to an orbital transmutation, a change in the\ndominant orbital character of some of the bands, between $T > T_{\\rm nem}$ and\n$T \\ll T_{\\rm nem}$. The first scenario relies on the spin-orbit coupling at\nthe $M$ point. We show that a finite spin-orbit coupling gives rise to orbital\ntransmutation, in which one of the modes, identified as $xz$ ($yz)$ at $T \\ll\nT_{{\\rm nem}}$, becomes predominantly $xy$ at $T > T_{{\\rm nem}}$ and hence\ndoes not merge with the predominantly $yz$ ($xz$) mode. The second scenario,\ncomplementary to the first, takes into consideration the fact that both ARPES\nand STM are surface probes. In the bulk, a direct hybridization between the\n$xz$ and $yz$ orbitals is not allowed at the $M$ point, however, it is\npermitted on the surface. In the presence of a direct $xz/yz$ hybridization,\nthe orbital character of the $xz/yz$ modes changes from pure $xz$ and pure $yz$\nat $T \\ll T_{{\\rm nem}}$ to $xz \\pm yz$ at $T > T_{{\\rm nem}}$, i.e., the two\nmodes again have mono-orbital character at low $T$, but do not merge at\n$T_{{\\rm nem}}$.

For\nintermediate times, the mean-square displacement of the particle often\nincreases approximately as $~t^\\alpha$, with $\\alpha<1$, typical of what is\ngenerally called anomalous diffusion.

In this paper, we use two exact numerical approaches to\nobtain diffusion data for a simple Lattice Monte Carlo model in both time\nlimits.

This work studies the problem of\naggregating individual's voting data under the local differential privacy\nsetting, where usefulness and soundness of the aggregated scores are of major\nconcern. One naive approach to the problem is adding Laplace random noises,\nhowever, it makes aggregated scores extremely fragile to new types of strategic\nbehaviors tailored to the local privacy setting: data amplification attack and\nview disguise attack. The data amplification attack means an attacker's\nmanipulation power is amplified by the privacy-preserving procedure when\ncontributing a fraud vote. The view disguise attack happens when an attacker\ncould disguise malicious data as valid private views to manipulate the voting\nresult.\n  In this work, after theoretically quantifying the estimation error bound and\nthe manipulating risk bound of the Laplace mechanism, we propose two mechanisms\nimproving the usefulness and soundness simultaneously: the weighted sampling\nmechanism and the additive mechanism. The former one interprets the score\nvector as probabilistic data. Compared to the Laplace mechanism for Borda\nvoting rule with $d$ candidates, it reduces the mean squared error bound by\nhalf and lowers the maximum magnitude risk bound from $+\\infty$ to\n$O(\\frac{d^3}{n\\epsilon})$. The latter one randomly outputs a subset of\ncandidates according to their total scores. Its mean squared error bound is\noptimized from $O(\\frac{d^5}{n\\epsilon^2})$ to $O(\\frac{d^4}{n\\epsilon^2})$,\nand its maximum magnitude risk bound is reduced to $O(\\frac{d^2}{n\\epsilon})$.\nExperimental results validate that our proposed approaches averagely reduce\nestimation error by $50\\%$ and are more robust to adversarial attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 01:53:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

To\naddress this issue, we performed 540 N-body simulations of protoplanetary disks\nrepresentative of typical models in the literature. We identified a total of\n194 analog systems containing at least three analogs, but only 17 systems\nsimultaneously contained analogs of the four terrestrial planets. From an\nanalysis of our analog systems, we found that, compared to the real planets,\ntruncated disks based on typical outcomes of the Grand Tack model produced\nanalogs of Mercury and Mars that were too dynamically cold and located too\nclose to the Venus and Earth analogs.

For this purpose we construct a realistic\nmodel describing the behavior of magnetic Fe $3d$ electrons and further map it\nonto the isotropic spin model. Our analysis suggests two possible scenaria for\nFe$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$. The first one is based on the homogeneous charge\ndistribution of the Fe$^{2+}$ ions amongst tetrahedral ($t$) and octahedral\n($o$) sites, which tends to low the crystallographic P6$_3$mc symmetry through\nthe formation of an orbitally ordered state. Nevertheless, the effect of the\norbital ordering on interatomic exchange interactions does not seem to be\nstrong, so that the magnetic properties can be described reasonably well by\naveraged interactions obeying the P6$_3$mc symmetry. The second scenario, which\nis supported by obtained parameters of on-site Coulomb repulsion and respects\nthe P6$_3$mc symmetry, implies the charge disproportionation involving somewhat\nexotic $1+$ ionization state of the $t$-Fe sites (and $3+$ state of the $o$-Fe\nsites). Somewhat surprisingly, these scenarios are practically\nindistinguishable from the viewpoint of exchange interactions, which are\npractically identical in these two cases.

We find that the rest mass\ndensity and the neutrino energy are the most relevant quantities in determining\nthe location of the decoupling surfaces. For mean energy neutrinos ($\\langle\nE_{{\\nu}_e} \\rangle \\approx 9~{\\rm MeV}$, $\\langle E_{{\\bar{\\nu}}_e} \\rangle\n\\approx 15~{\\rm MeV}$, $\\langle E_{{\\nu}_{\\mu,\\tau}} \\rangle \\approx 25~{\\rm\nMeV}$), diffusion surfaces are located around $10^{11}{\\rm g~cm^{-3}}$ for all\nneutrino species, while equilibrium surfaces for heavy flavor neutrinos are\nsignificantly deeper (several $10^{12}{\\rm g~cm^{-3}}$) than the ones of\n$\\bar{\\nu}_e$ and $\\nu_e$ ($\\gtrsim 10^{11}{\\rm g~cm^{-3}}$).

An algorithm in this setting has access to an oracle with full\nknowledge of an optimal clustering, and the algorithm can ask the oracle\nqueries of the form, \"Does the optimal clustering put vertices $ u $ and $ v $\nin the same cluster?\" Due to its simplicity, this querying model can easily be\nimplemented in real crowd-sourcing platforms and has attracted a lot of recent\nwork. In this paper, we study the popular correlation clustering problem\n(Bansal et al., 2002) under this framework. Given a complete graph $G=(V,E)$\nwith positive and negative edge labels, correlation clustering objective aims\nto compute a graph clustering that minimizes the total number of disagreements,\nthat is the negative intra-cluster edges and positive inter-cluster edges.

We first augment an episodic memory module into the\nnetwork, which can provide more relevant neighbours for both training and\ntesting. Then the neighbours are organized in a tree graph with the target\ninstance as the root node. The neighbourhood information is gradually\naggregated to the root node in a bottom-up manner, and aggregation weights are\nsupervised by the class relationships between the nodes.

The acceleration\ncontrol of the multi-rotor requires conversion of the desired acceleration\nsignal to the desired roll, pitch, and total thrust. But because the attitude\ndynamics and the thrust dynamics are different, simple kinematic signal\nconversion without consideration of those difference can cause serious\nperformance degradation in acceleration tracking. Unlike most existing\ntranslational force control techniques that are based on such simple inversion,\nour new method allows controlling the acceleration of the multi-rotor more\nprecisely by considering the dynamics of the multi-rotor during the kinematic\ninversion. By combining the DOB with the translational force system that\nincludes the improved conversion technique, we achieve robustness with respect\nto the external force disturbances that hinders the accurate acceleration\ncontrol. mu-analysis is performed to ensure the robust stability of the overall\nclosed-loop system, considering the combined effect of various possible model\nuncertainties. Both simulation and experiment are conducted to validate the\nproposed technique, which confirms the satisfactory performance to track the\ndesired acceleration of the multi-rotor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 07:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-16"}

The goal is to\nidentify faulty states in the program, triggered by malformed inputs. Even\nthough this technique is widely performed, fuzzing cannot be applied to\nembedded devices to its full extent. Due to the lack of adequately powerful I/O\ncapabilities or an operating system the feedback needed for fuzzing cannot be\nacquired.\n  In this paper we present and evaluate a new approach to extract feedback for\nfuzzing on embedded devices using information the power consumption leaks.\nSide-channel aware fuzzing is a threefold process that is initiated by sending\nan input to a target device and measuring its power consumption. First, we\nextract features from the power traces of the target device using machine\nlearning algorithms. Subsequently, we use the features to reconstruct the code\nstructure of the analyzed firmware. In the final step we calculate a score for\nthe input, which is proportional to the code coverage.\n  We carry out our proof of concept by fuzzing synthetic software and a\nlight-weight AES implementation running on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller.\nOur results show that the power side-channel carries information relevant for\nfuzzing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 08:18:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

Instead of collecting data individually, a more efficient\ntechnique, computation over multi-access channels (CoMAC), has emerged to\ncompute functions by exploiting the signal-superposition property of wireless\nchannels. However, the implementation of CoMAC in disorganized networks with\nmultiple relays (hops) is still an open problem.

First, to make the disorganized\nnetwork more tractable, we reorganize the disorganized network into a\nhierarchical network with multiple layers that consists of subgroups and\ngroups.

By computing and communicating\nsubgroup and group functions over layers, the desired functions are\nreconstructed at the fusion center. The general computation rate is derived and\nthe performance is further improved through time allocation and power control.\nThe closed-form solutions to optimization are obtained, which suggest that\nexisting CoMAC and orthogonal communication schemes can be generalized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 09:16:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

The\nissue of building temperature control is analyzed in which the controller is to\ndevise a scheme to distribute available scarce power to every room to regulate\ntheir temperature as per the comfort of user in the best possible manner. The\npaper correlates the global constraint of fixed resource amount with the\nconstant population size. The respective population game is evaluated by means\nof a dynamical model of the evolutionary game theory to find the necessary\ncontrol action. The robustness of optimal solution with respect to minor\nfluctuations in the temperature distribution is characterized using\nevolutionary stable strategy ( ESS ). Along with the global constraint, the\nproblem formulation constitutes local constraint over an individual control\nunit located in every room. The classical dynamical models of evolutionary game\ntheory such as replicator dynamics, logit dynamics, etc. fail to incorporate\nrespective constraints. With the escort evolutionary dynamical (ED) model it is\npossible to address these local constraints through the concept of the\nintersection of simplices. However, evaluation of these classical dynamics\nalong with ED is driven by expected payoff obtained by the overall population,\nwhich renders a centralized implementation approach. To mitigate this central\ndependency a distributed version of the ED model referred to as distributed\nescort dynamics (DED) is proposed.

During the\ntraining process, the proposed CL offers separate control over preservation of\nthe speech component quality, suppression of the residual noise component, and\npreservation of a naturally sounding residual noise component. We illustrate\nthe potential of the proposed CL by evaluating a standard convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) for mask-based speech enhancement. The new CL obtains a better\nand more balanced performance in almost all employed instrumental quality\nmetrics over the baseline losses, the latter comprising the conventional mean\nsquared error (MSE) loss and also auditory-related loss functions, such as the\nperceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) loss and the recently proposed\nperceptual weighting filter loss.

The reconnection at\nthese sites is expected to cause localised bi-directional flows and extended\nshock waves; however, these signatures are rarely observed as extremely high\nspatial-resolution data are required. Here, we use H-alpha imaging data sampled\nby the Swedish Solar Telescope's CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter to\ninvestigate whether bi-directional flows can be detected within inverted-Y\nshaped jets near the solar limb. These jets are apparent in the H-alpha line\nwings, while no signature of either jet is observed in the H-alpha line core,\nimplying reconnection took place below the chromospheric canopy. Asymmetries in\nthe H-alpha line profiles along the legs of the jets indicate the presence of\nbi-directional flows, consistent with cartoon models of reconnection in\nchromospheric anemone jets. These asymmetries are present for over two minutes,\nlonger than the lifetimes of Rapid Blue Excursions, and beyond \\pm 1 \\AA\\ into\nthe wings of the line indicating that flows within the inverted-Y shaped jets\nare responsible for the imbalance in the profiles, rather than motions in the\nforeground. Additionally, surges form following the occurrence of the\ninverted-Y shaped jets. This surge formation is consistent with models which\nsuggest such events could be caused by the propagation of shock waves from\nreconnection sites in the photosphere to the upper atmosphere. Overall, our\nresults provide evidence that magnetic reconnection in the photosphere can\ncause bi-directional flows within inverted-Y shaped jets and could be the\ndriver of surges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 13:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

Construction accidents are the result of the interaction between\nunsafe work conditions and workers unsafe behaviors. Given this relation,\nperceived risk is determined by an individual response to a potential work\nhazard during the work. As such, risk perception is critical to understand\nworkers unsafe behaviors. Established methods of assessing workers perceived\nrisk have mainly relied on surveys and interviews. However, these post-hoc\nmethods, which are limited to monitoring dynamic changes in risk perception and\nconducting surveys at a construction site, may prove cumbersome to workers.\nAdditionally, these methods frequently suffer from self-reported bias. To\novercome the limitations of previous subjective measures, this study aims to\ndevelop a framework for the objective and continuous prediction of construction\nworkers perceived risk using physiological signals [e.g., electrodermal\nactivity (EDA)] acquired from workers wristband-type biosensors. To achieve\nthis objective, physiological signals were collected from eight construction\nworkers while they performed regular tasks in the field. Various filtering\nmethods were applied to exclude noises recorded in the signal and to extract\nvarious features of the signals as workers experienced different risk levels.\nThen, a supervised machine-learning model was trained to explore the\napplicability of the collected physiological signals for the prediction of risk\nperception. The results showed that features based on EDA data collected from\nwristbands are feasible and useful to the process of continuously monitoring\nworkers perceived risk during ongoing work. This study contributes to an\nin-depth understanding of construction workers perceived risk by developing a\nnoninvasive means of continuously monitoring workers perceived risk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 14:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

The LD in\nhis form is shown to enable semi-analytical decompositions of self-similar\nturbulent flows in general coordinate systems. The decomposition is applied to\nthe far-field region of the fully developed turbulent axi-symmetric jet, which\nis expressed in stretched spherical coordinates in order to exploit the\nself-similar nature of the flow while ensuring the self-adjointness of the LD\nintegral. From the LD integral it is deduced that the optimal eigenfunctions in\nthe streamwise direction are stretched amplitude-decaying Fourier modes\n(SADFM). The SADFM are obtained from the LD integral upon the introduction of a\nstreamwise-decaying weight function in the vector space definition. The\nwavelength of the Fourier modes is linearly increasing in the streamwise\ndirection with an amplitude which decays with the -3/2 power of distance from\nthe virtual origin. The streamwise evolution of the SADFM re-sembles reversed\nwave shoaling known from surface waves. The energy- and cross-spectra obtained\nfrom these SADFM exhibit a -5/3- and a -7/3-slope region, respectively, as\nwould be expected for regular Fourier modes in homogeneous and constant shear\nflows. The approach introduced in this work can be extended to other flows\nwhich admit to equilibrium similarity, such that a Fourier-based decomposition\nalong inhomogeneous flow directions can be performed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 14:05:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 10:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-05"}

The pseudo\nlarge separation of chaotic modes is very close to the large separation of\nisland modes. Its value is related to the sound speed averaged over the\nmeridional plane of the star.

We introduce a\nhooking layer, called a LinearScope, which allows us to run the network and the\nlinear interpreter in parallel. Its implementation is simple, flexible and\nefficient. From here we can make many curious inquiries: how do these linear\nsystems look like? When the rows and columns of the transformation matrix are\nimages, how do they look like? What type of basis do these linear\ntransformations rely on? The answers depend on the problems presented, through\nwhich we take a tour to some popular architectures used for classification,\nsuper-resolution (SR) and image-to-image translation (I2I).

The former decrease with the distance, while\nthe latter increase. In the intermediate regime where they have the same order\nof magnitude (the 'inert Oort cloud'), both are weak, resulting in very long\nevolution timescales. To date, three observed objects can be considered to\nbelong to this category.\n  Aims: We aim to provide a clear understanding of where this transition\noccurs, and to characterise the long-term dynamics of small bodies in the\nintermediate regime: relevant resonances, chaotic zones (if any), and\ntimescales at play.\n  Results: There exists a tilted equilibrium plane (Laplace plane) about which\norbits precess. The dynamics is integrable in the low and high semi-major axis\nregimes, but mostly chaotic in between. From 800 to 1100 au, the chaos covers\nalmost all the eccentricity range. The diffusion timescales are large, but not\nto the point of being indiscernible in a 4.5 Gyrs duration: the perihelion\ndistance can actually vary from tens to hundreds of au. Orbital variations are\nfavoured in specific ranges of inclination corresponding to well-defined\nresonances. Starting from uniform distributions, the orbital angles cluster\nafter 4.5 Gyrs for semi-major axes larger than 500 au, because of a very slow\ndifferential precession.\n  Conclusions: Even if it is characterised by very long timescales, the inert\nOort cloud is much less inert than it appears. Orbits can be considered inert\nover 4.5 Gyrs only in small portions of the space of orbital elements, which\ninclude (90377) Sedna and 2012VP113. Effects of the galactic tides are\ndiscernible down to semi-major axes of about 500 au. We advocate including the\ngalactic tides in simulations of distant trans-Neptunian objects, especially\nwhen studying the formation of detached bodies or the clustering of orbital\nelements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 15:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

We remark that some standard notions\nabout FRW Universes collapse in these theories, most notably spatial\nhomogeneity and isotropy may now co-exist with violations of parity invariance.\nThe parity violating solutions have non-vanishing Weyl curvature even within\nFRW models. The presence of parity violating torsion opens up the space of\npossible such theories with relevant FRW modifications: in particular the\nPontryagin term can play an important role even in the absence of spinorial\nmatter. We present a number of parity violating solutions with and without\nmatter. The former are the non-self dual vacuum solutions long suspected to\nexist. The latter lead to tracking and non-tracking solutions with a number of\nobservational problems, unless we invoke the Pontryagin term. An examination of\nthe Hamiltonian structure of the theory reveals that the parity even and the\nparity violating solutions belong to two distinct branches of the theory, with\ndifferent gauge symmetries (constraints) and different numbers of degrees of\nfreedom. The parity even branch is nothing but standard relativity with a\ncosmological constant which has become pure gauge under conformal invariance if\nmatter is absent, or a slave of matter (and so not an independent degree of\nfreedom) if non-conformally invariant matter is present. In contrast, the\nparity violating branch contains a genuinely new degree of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 15:59:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 15:58:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 16:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}

However, current generation-based methods are only able\nto attack one specific target (category) within one model, thus making them not\napplicable to real classification systems that often have hundreds/thousands of\ncategories.

By incorporating the specified category information into the\nintermediate features, it can attack any category of the target classification\nmodel during runtime. Experiments show that the proposed MAN can produce\nstronger attack results and also have better transferability than previous\nstate-of-the-art methods in both multi-target attack task and single-target\nattack task.

In the proposed framework, a\ncore machine learning algorithm can have three implementations: server layer\nimplementation, streaming layer implementation, and smart contract\nimplementation. However, there are still open questions. First, the streaming\nlayer usually deploys on edge devices and therefore has limited memory and\ncomputing power. How can we run machine learning on the streaming layer?\nSecond, most data that are stored on blockchain are financial transactions, for\nwhich fraud detection is often needed. However, in some applications, training\ndata are hard to obtain. Can we build good machine learning models to do fraud\ndetection with limited training data? These questions motivated this paper;\nwhich makes two contributions. First, it proposes training a machine learning\nmodel on the server layer and saving the model with a special binary data\nformat. Then, the streaming layer can take this blob of binary data as input\nand score incoming data online. The blob of binary data is very compact and can\nbe deployed on edge devices. Second, the paper presents a new method of\nsynthetic data generation that can enrich the training data set. Experiments\nshow that this synthetic data generation is very effective in applications such\nas fraud detection in financial data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 00:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

In this study, we investigate hypothesized interactions of the\ninflammatory system with the thermal and cardiovascular regulatory systems in\nresponse to an endotoxin challenge using mathematical modeling.

With the\ngrowing size and complexity of these networks, hardware implementation becomes\nchallenging because scaling up the size of a single array (crossbar) of fully\nconnected neurons is no longer feasible due to strict energy budget. Modern\nneromorphic hardware integrates small-sized crossbars with time-multiplexed\ninterconnects. Partitioning SNNs becomes essential in order to map them on\nneuromorphic hardware with the major aim to reduce the global communication\nlatency and energy overhead. To achieve this goal, we propose our instantiation\nof particle swarm optimization, which partitions SNNs into local synapses\n(mapped on crossbars) and global synapses (mapped on time-multiplexed\ninterconnects), with the objective of reducing spike communication on the\ninterconnect. This improves latency, power consumption as well as application\nperformance by reducing inter-spike interval distortion and spike disorders.\nOur framework is implemented in Python, interfacing CARLsim, a GPU-accelerated\napplication-level spiking neural network simulator with an extended version of\nNoxim, for simulating time-multiplexed interconnects. Experiments are conducted\nwith realistic and synthetic SNN-based applications with different computation\nmodels, topologies and spike coding schemes.

We model this dynamic learning process as an\n$L_0$-norm regularized binary optimization problem, in which each unit of a\nneural network (e.g., weight, neuron or channel, etc.) is attached with a\nstochastic binary gate, whose parameters determine the level of activity of a\nunit in the network. At the beginning, only a small portion of binary gates\n(therefore the corresponding neurons) are activated, while the remaining\nneurons are in a hibernation mode. As the learning proceeds, some neurons might\nbe activated or deactivated if doing so can be justified by the cost-benefit\ntradeoff measured by the $L_0$-norm regularized objective. As the training gets\nmature, the probability of transition between activation and deactivation will\ndiminish until a final hardening stage. We demonstrate that all of these\nlearning dynamics can be modulated by a single parameter $k$ seamlessly. Our\nneural plasticity network (NPN) can prune or expand a network depending on the\ninitial capacity of network provided by the user; it also unifies dropout (when\n$k=0$), traditional training of DNNs (when $k=\\infty$) and interpolates between\nthese two. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learning framework\nthat unifies network sparsification and network expansion in an end-to-end\ntraining pipeline.

We present a detailed model of\nthe light-harvesting complexes in purple bacteria, including explicit\ninteraction with sunlight; energy loss through radiative and non-radiative\nprocesses; and dephasing and thermalizing effects of coupling to a vibrational\nbath. An important feature of the model is that we capture the effect of slow\nvibrational modes by introducing time-dependent disorder. Our model describes\nthe experimentally observed high efficiency of light harvesting, despite the\nabsence of long-range quantum coherence. The one-exciton part of the quantum\nstate fluctuates due to slow vibrational changes, but remains highly mixed at\nall times. This lack of long-range coherence suggests a relatively minor role\nfor structure in determining the efficiency of bacterial light harvesting. To\ninvestigate this we built hypothetical models with randomly arranged\nchromophores, but still observed high efficiency when typical nearest-neighbour\ndistances are comparable with those found in nature. This helps to explain the\nefficiency of energy transport in organisms whose chromophore networks differ\nwidely in structure, while also suggesting new design criteria for efficient\nartificial light-harvesting devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 15:12:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-23"}
