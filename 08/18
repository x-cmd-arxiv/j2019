In this paper, we argue that the\ndynamical activity of the nodes may strongly reshape their relevance inside the\nnetwork making centrality measures in many cases misleading.

Some observations\nsuggest a decline in exacerbation rates in clinical trials over time. A more\nsystematic understanding would help to improve the design and interpretation of\nCOPD trials.\n  METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-regression of the placebo\ngroups in published randomized controlled trials reporting exacerbations as an\noutcome. A Bayesian negative binomial model was developed to accommodate\nresults that are reported in different formats; results are reported with\ncredible intervals (CI) and posterior tail probabilities ($p_B$).\n  RESULTS: Of 1114 studies identified by our search, 55 were ultimately\nincluded. Exacerbation rates decreased by 6.7% (95% CI (4.4, 9.0); $p_B$ <\n0.001) per year, or 50% (95% CI (36, 61)) per decade. Adjusting for available\nstudy and baseline characteristics such as forced expiratory volume in 1 s\n(FEV1) did not alter the observed trend considerably. Two subsets of studies,\none using a true placebo group and the other allowing inhaled corticosteroids\nin the \"placebo\" group, also yielded consistent results.\n  CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this meta-regression indicates that the rate of\nCOPD exacerbations decreased over the past two decades to a clinically relevant\nextent independent of important prognostic factors. This suggests that care is\nneeded in the design of new trials or when comparing results from older trials\nwith more recent ones. Also a considerable effect of adjunct therapy on COPD\nexacerbations can be assumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Aug 2019 20:32:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

Traditionally, the study of dark matter structure in\ncompact-source strong gravitational lenses has been limited to radio-loud\nsystems, as the radio emission is extended and thus unaffected by microlensing\nwhich can mimic the signal of dark matter structure. An alternate approach is\nto measure quasar nuclear-narrow line emission, which is free from microlensing\nand present in virtually all quasar lenses.

In this paper, a new\napproach is presented to bridge the gap between Demand-Side Management (DSM)\nand microgrid portfolio, sizing and placement optimization. Although DSM helps\nenergy consumers to take advantage of recent developments in utilization of\nDistributed Energy Resources (DERs) especially microgrids, a huge need of\nconnecting DSM results to microgrid optimization is being felt. Consequently, a\nnovel model that integrates the DSM techniques and microgrid modules in a\ntwo-layer configuration is proposed. In the first layer, DSM is employed to\nminimize the electricity demand (e.g. heating and cooling loads) based on zone\ntemperature set-point. Using the optimal load profile obtained from the first\nlayer, all investment and operation costs of a microgrid are then optimized in\nthe second layer.

This novel framework integrates the\nstate-of-the-art Bayesian formulations into a hierarchical setting aiming to\ncapture both the identification precision and the ensemble variability prompted\ndue to modeling errors. Such cutting-edge developments have been absent from\nthe modal identification literature, sustained as a long-standing problem at\nthe research spotlight. Central to this framework is a Gaussian hyper\nprobability model, whose mean and covariance matrix are unknown encapsulating\nthe uncertainty of the modal parameters. Detailed computation of this\nhierarchical model is addressed under two major algorithms using Markov chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and Laplace asymptotic approximation methods. Since\nfor a small number of data sets the hyper covariance matrix is often\nunidentifiable, a practical remedy is suggested through the eigenbasis\ntransformation of the covariance matrix, which effectively reduces the number\nof unknown hyper-parameters. It is also proved that under some conditions the\nmaximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the hyper mean and covariance coincide\nwith the ensemble mean and covariance computed using the MAP estimations\ncorresponding to multiple data sets. This interesting finding addresses\nrelevant concerns related to the outcome of the mainstream Bayesian methods in\ncapturing the stochastic variability from dissimilar data sets. Finally, the\ndynamical response of a prototype structure tested on a shaking table subjected\nto Gaussian white noise base excitation and the ambient vibration measurement\nof a cable footbridge are employed to demonstrate the proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Aug 2019 03:56:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 06:00:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 28 Dec 2019 11:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

High-level autonomous decision making is implemented as a\nhierarchy of master and slave state machines.

The\nreason lies in the fact that obtaining high-quality 3D annotations for\nin-the-wild images is an extremely hard task that consumes enormous amount of\nresources and manpower. To tackle this problem, previous methods adopt a hybrid\ntraining strategy that exploits multiple heterogeneous types of annotations\nincluding 3D and 2D while leaving the efficacy of each annotation not\nthoroughly investigated. In this work, we aim to perform a comprehensive study\non cost and effectiveness trade-off between different annotations.\nSpecifically, we focus on the challenging task of in-the-wild 3D human recovery\nfrom single images when paired 3D annotations are not fully available. Through\nextensive experiments, we obtain several observations: 1) 3D annotations are\nefficient, whereas traditional 2D annotations such as 2D keypoints and body\npart segmentation are less competent in guiding 3D human recovery. 2) Dense\nCorrespondence such as DensePose is effective. When there are no paired\nin-the-wild 3D annotations available, the model exploiting dense correspondence\ncan achieve 92% of the performance compared to a model trained with paired 3D\ndata.

Unfortunately, the Euler characteristic\nnumber does not change when crossing the critical points $|h|=1$ and thus can\nnot be used to characterize the topological phase transition of the present\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Aug 2019 15:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

Our main finding is\nthat the conversion efficiency of the laser energy into a beam of gamma-rays\n($5^{\\circ}$ opening angle) can be significantly increased without increasing\nthe laser intensity by utilizing channels with an optimal density. The\nconversion efficiency into multi-MeV photons increases roughly linearly with\nthe incident laser power $P$, as we increase $P$ from 1 PW to 4 PW while\nkeeping the laser peak intensity fixed at $5 \\times 10^{22}$ W/cm$^2$.

The main result of this\npaper is that, under the same hypotheses, the ground-state energy is analytic\nfor values of the coupling constant belonging to a fixed interval, uniformly in\nthe length of the chain. Furthermore, assuming that the interaction potentials\nare invariant under translations, we prove that, in the thermodynamic limit,\nthe energy per site is analytic for values of the coupling constant in the same\nfixed interval. In our proof we use a new method introduced in [FP], which is\nbased on local Lie-Schwinger conjugations of the Hamiltonians associated with\nconnected subsets of the chain. We prove a rather strong result concerning\ncomplex Hamiltonians corresponding to complex values of the coupling constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Aug 2019 09:17:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

The\nemergence of cyber attacks has brought new challenges to the state estimation\nof generators. Especially, false data injection (FDI) attacks deteriorate the\naccuracy of state estimation by injecting the false data into the measurement\ndevice. In this regard, this paper proposes for the first time an FDI attack\nmodel based on the dynamic state estimation of generators. Firstly, Taylor's\nformula was used to linearize the generator's measurement equation. Secondly,\naccording to the principle that the measurement residuals before and after the\nFDI attack are equal, the expressions of the attack vectors were established,\nand they were applied to the measurement quantities to avoid the conventional\nbad data detection. Thereby, the FDI attacks were successfully implemented.\nThen, three attack scenarios were set according to the degree of the FDI\nattacks, and they were tested by the cubature Kalman filter (CKF) and the\nrobust cubature Kalman filter (RCKF). Finally, the simulation results of the\nIEEE 9-bus system and the New England 16-machine 68-bus system verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed FDI attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Aug 2019 14:32:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-15"}

However, in many languages and\nspecialized corpora, words are composed by concatenating semantically\nmeaningful subword structures. Word-level analysis cannot leverage the semantic\ninformation present in such subword structures. With regard to word embedding\ntechniques, this leads to not only poor embeddings for infrequent words in\nlong-tailed text corpora but also weak capabilities for handling\nout-of-vocabulary words. In this paper we propose MorphMine for unsupervised\nmorpheme segmentation. MorphMine applies a parsimony criterion to\nhierarchically segment words into the fewest number of morphemes at each level\nof the hierarchy. This leads to longer shared morphemes at each level of\nsegmentation. Experiments show that MorphMine segments words in a variety of\nlanguages into human-verified morphemes. Additionally, we experimentally\ndemonstrate that utilizing MorphMine morphemes to enrich word embeddings\nconsistently improves embedding quality on a variety of of embedding\nevaluations and a downstream language modeling task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Aug 2019 00:45:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 22:18:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}
