In this work, we propose a method for learning disentangled\nrepresentations to allow for localized image manipulations. We use face images\nas our example of choice. Depending on the image region, identity and other\nfacial attributes can be modified. The proposed network can transfer parts of a\nface such as shape and color of eyes, hair, mouth, etc.~directly between\npersons while all other parts of the face remain unchanged. The network allows\nto generate modified images which appear like realistic images. Our model\nlearns disentangled representations by weak supervision. We propose a localized\nresnet autoencoder optimized using several loss functions including a loss\nbased on the semantic segmentation, which we interpret as masks, and a loss\nwhich enforces disentanglement by decomposition of the latent space into\nstatistically independent subspaces. We evaluate the proposed solution w.r.t.\ndisentanglement and generated image quality. Convincing results are\ndemonstrated using the CelebA dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 09:08:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

However, the high demand for\ncomputing resources in training such models hinders their application in\npractice. In order to alleviate this resource hunger in large-scale model\ntraining, we propose a Patient Knowledge Distillation approach to compress an\noriginal large model (teacher) into an equally-effective lightweight shallow\nnetwork (student). Different from previous knowledge distillation methods,\nwhich only use the output from the last layer of the teacher network for\ndistillation, our student model patiently learns from multiple intermediate\nlayers of the teacher model for incremental knowledge extraction, following two\nstrategies: ($i$) PKD-Last: learning from the last $k$ layers; and ($ii$)\nPKD-Skip: learning from every $k$ layers. These two patient distillation\nschemes enable the exploitation of rich information in the teacher's hidden\nlayers, and encourage the student model to patiently learn from and imitate the\nteacher through a multi-layer distillation process. Empirically, this\ntranslates into improved results on multiple NLP tasks with significant gain in\ntraining efficiency, without sacrificing model accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2019 16:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

While OVA and\nOVO are quite simple, both of them assume all classes are orthogonal which\nneglect the latent correlation between classes in real-world.\nError-Correcting-Output-Code (ECOC) based decomposition methods, on the other\nhand, are more preferable due to its integration of the correlation among\nclasses.

For systems with SFR > 1 M(sun)/yr,\nthe volume and mass of hot gas are strongly and linearly correlated with the\nstar formation rate (SFR). This supports the idea that stellar/supernovae\nfeedback dominates the production of hot gas in these galaxies. We compared the\nmass of X-ray-emitting hot gas Mx(gas) with the molecular and atomic hydrogen\ninterstellar gas masses in these galaxies (M(H2) and M(HI), respectively),\nusing published carbon monoxide and 21 cm HI measurements.

The ratio Mx(gas)/SFR is anti-correlated with the IRAS\n60 micron to 100 micron flux ratio and with the Spitzer 3.6 micron to 24\nmicron. These trends may be due to variations in the spatial density of young\nstars, the stellar age, the ratio of young to old stars, the initial mass\nfunction, and/or the efficiency of stellar feedback. Galaxies with low SFR (<1\nM(sun)/yr) and high K band luminosities may have an excess of hot gas relative\nto the relation for higher SFR galaxies, while galaxies with low K band\nluminosities (and therefore low stellar masses) may have a deficiency in hot\ngas, but our sample is not large enough for strong statistical significance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2019 22:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

The new feature considered here is the\npossibility that these nuggets become ferromagnetic. This possibility was\npointed out in \\cite{tatsumi}, although ferromagnetism may also take place due\nsome anomaly terms found in \\cite{son}-\\cite{son2}. The purpose of the present\nletter however, is not to give evidence in favor or against these statements.\nInstead, it is focused in some direct consequences of this ferromagnetic\nbehavior, if it exists. The first is that the nugget magnetic field induces an\nelectric field due to the axion wall, which may induce pair production by\nSchwinger effect. Depending on the value of the magnetic field, the pair\nproduction can be quite large. A critical value for such magnetic field at the\nsurface of the nugget is obtained, and it is argued that the value of the\nmagnetic field of \\cite{tatsumi} is at the verge of stability and may induce\nlarge pair production. The consequences of this enhanced pair production may be\nunclear. It may indicate that the the nugget evaporates, but on the other hand\nit may be just an indication that the intrinsic magnetic field disappears and\nthe nuggets evolves to a non magnetized state such as\n\\cite{zhitnitsky}-\\cite{zhitnitsky13}. The interaction of such magnetic and\nelectric nugget with the troposphere of the earth is also analyzed. However, if\nthe magnetic field does not decay before the actual universe, then this would\nlead to high energy electron flux due to its interaction with the electron\ngases of the Milky Way. This suggests that these magnetized quarks may be a\nconsiderably part of dark matter, but only if their hypothetical magnetic and\nelectric fields are evaporated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2019 23:30:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Oct 2019 22:47:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 2019 22:02:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 17:48:04 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 23:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Beside the\ntopologically protected surface states (TSS), parallel channels may exist,\nnamely the interior of the not-ideally insulating TI film, the interface layer\nto the substrate, and the substrate itself. To be able to take advantage of the\nauspicious transport properties of the TSS, the influence of the parasitic\nparallel channels on the total current transport has to be minimized. Because\nthe conductivity of the interior (bulk) of the thin TI film is difficult to\naccess by measurements, we propose here an approach for calculating the mobile\ncharge carrier concentration in the TI film. To this end, we calculate the\nnear-surface band bending using parameters obtained experimentally from\nsurface-sensitive measurements, namely (gate-dependent) four-point resistance\nmeasurements and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES). While in\nmost cases another parameter in the calculations, i.e. the concentration of\nunintentional dopants inside the thin TI film, is unknown, it turns out that in\nthe thin-film limit the band bending is largely independent of the dopant\nconcentration in the film. Thus, a well-founded estimate of the total mobile\ncharge carrier concentration and the conductivity of the interior of the thin\nTI film proves possible. Since the interface and substrate conductivities can\nbe measured by a four-probe conductance measurement prior to the deposition of\nthe TI film, the total contribution of all parasitic channels, and therefore\nalso the contribution of the vitally important TSS, can be determined reliably.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 00:31:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2020 23:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

In order to clarify the role of contact angles\nand to obtain a tractable model, we consider a two-dimensional droplet.

However, employing separate kernels for individual\nbranches degrades the generalization and representation abilities of the\nnetwork, and the number of parameters increases linearly in the number of\nbranches. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel network structure namely\nKernel-Sharing Atrous Convolution (KSAC), where branches of different receptive\nfields share the same kernel, i.e., let a single kernel see the input feature\nmaps more than once with different receptive fields, to facilitate\ncommunication among branches and perform feature augmentation inside the\nnetwork.

Since large size single crystal of Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$\ncan be easily grown, many researches have been performed. However, a large part\nof the reported results are under controversy, including the resistivity,\nsusceptibility, Hall effect, gap structure, phase diagram, etc. These\ncontroversies are believed to come from the sample-dependent Fe\nnonstoichiometries, which originate from the partial occupation of the second\nFe site (excess Fe) in the Te/Se layer. The excess Fe with valence near Fe$^+$\nwill provide electron doping into the system. Meanwhile, the excess Fe is also\nstrongly magnetic, which will act as a paring breaker and also localize the\ncharge carriers. Removing the excess Fe is essential to probe the intrinsic\nproperties and mechanism of superconductivity of Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_x$\ncompounds.

ZDA poses a formidable security challenge since its attack\nsignal is hidden in the null-space of the state-space representation of the\ncontrol system and hence it can evade conventional detection methods. An\nintuitive defense strategy builds on changing the aforementioned representation\nvia switching through a set of carefully crafted topologies. In this paper, we\npropose realistic ZDA variations where the attacker is aware of this\ntopology-switching strategy, and hence employs the following policies to avoid\ndetection: (i) pause, update and resume ZDA according to the knowledge of\nswitching topologies; (ii) cooperate with a concurrent stealthy topology attack\nthat alters network topology at switching times, such that the original ZDA is\nfeasible under the corrupted topology.

Such forces often lead to a complex pattern of dependence among\nedges, with non-trivial large-scale structures emerging from relatively simple\nlocal mechanisms. While this provides a powerful tool for probing macro-micro\nconnections, much remains to be understood about how local forces shape global\noutcomes. One simple question of this type is that of the conditions needed for\nsocial forces to stabilize a particular structure. We refer to this property as\nlocal stability and seek a general means of identifying the set of parameters\nunder which a target graph is locally stable with respect to a set of\nalternatives. Here, we provide a complete characterization of the region of the\nparameter space inducing local stability, showing it to be the interior of a\nconvex cone whose faces can be derived from the change-scores of the sufficient\nstatistics vis-a-vis the alternative structures. As we show, local stability is\na necessary but not sufficient condition for more general notions of stability,\nthe latter of which can be explored more efficiently by using the ``stable\ncone'' within the parameter space as a starting point.

The main contribution of the paper is threefold:\n(1) We show an $O(1)$-round algorithm which constructs a low-congestion\nshortcut with quality $O(kD)$ for any $k$-chordal graph, and prove that the\nquality and running time of this construction is nearly optimal up to\npolylogarithmic factors.

Nevertheless, the problem is not trivial\nespecially when exploring the interactions between objects to boost video\nobject detectors. The difficulty originates from the aspect that reliable\nobject relations in a video should depend on not only the objects in the\npresent frame but also all the supportive objects extracted over a long range\nspan of the video. In this paper, we introduce a new design to capture the\ninteractions across the objects in spatio-temporal context. Specifically, we\npresent Relation Distillation Networks (RDN) --- a new architecture that\nnovelly aggregates and propagates object relation to augment object features\nfor detection. Technically, object proposals are first generated via Region\nProposal Networks (RPN). RDN then, on one hand, models object relation via\nmulti-stage reasoning, and on the other, progressively distills relation\nthrough refining supportive object proposals with high objectness scores in a\ncascaded manner. The learnt relation verifies the efficacy on both improving\nobject detection in each frame and box linking across frames.

In a BBC, the\nconversation is grounded in a knowledge source. A key challenge in BBCs is\nKnowledge Selection (KS): given a conversational context, try to find the\nappropriate background knowledge (a text fragment containing related facts or\ncomments, etc.) based on which to generate the next response. Previous work\naddresses KS by employing attention and/or pointer mechanisms.

We argue for the adoption of a global perspective,\ni.e., pre-selecting some text fragments from the background knowledge that\ncould help determine the topic of the next response. We enhance KS in BBCs by\nintroducing a Global-to-Local Knowledge Selection (GLKS) mechanism.

It greatly limits the\ncapability of modeling the long-range temporal dependencies since one-order\ninteractions cannot be maintained for a long term due to information dilution\nand gradient vanishing.

The generated network consists of a sequence of stacked\ncomputation cells. A computation cell is represented as a directed acyclic\ngraph, in which each node is a hidden representation (i.e., feature map) and\neach edge is associated with an operation (e.g., convolution and pooling),\nwhich transforms data to a new layer. During the training, the CAS algorithm\nexplores the search space for an optimized computation cell to build a network.\nThe cells of the same type share one architecture but with different weights.\nIn real applications, however, an optimization may need to be conducted under\nsome constraints such as GPU time and model size. To this end, a cost\ncorresponding to the constraint will be assigned to each operation. When an\noperation is selected during the search, its associated cost will be added to\nthe objective. As a result, our CAS is able to search an optimized architecture\nwith customized constraints. The approach has been thoroughly evaluated on\nCityscapes and CamVid datasets, and demonstrates superior performance over\nseveral state-of-the-art techniques.

Especially in volumetric imaging of thoracic and\nabdominal organs, motion-awareness is essential for reducing motion artifacts\nin the final image. A recently proposed MR imaging approach copes with motion\nby observing the motion patterns during the acquisition. Repetitive scanning of\nthe k-space center region enables the extraction of the patient motion while\nacquiring the remaining part of the k-space. Due to highly redundant\nmeasurements of the center, the required scanning time of over 11 min and the\nreconstruction time of 2 h exceed clinical applicability though. We propose an\naccelerated motion-aware MR imaging method where the motion is inferred from\nsmall-sized k-space center patches and an initial training phase during which\nthe characteristic movements are modeled.

Since Nakamoto's\nBitcoin cryptocurrency system, an enormous number of decentralised applications\nhave been proposed on top of these technologies, aiming at more transparency\nand trustworthiness than their traditional counterparts. These applications\nspread over a lot of areas, e.g. financial services, healthcare,\ntransportation, supply chain management, and cloud computing. While Blockchain\nbrings transparency and decentralised trust intuitively due to the consensus of\na (very large) group of nodes (or, miners), it introduces very subtle\nimplications for other desirable properties such as privacy. In this work, we\ndemonstrate these subtle implications for Blockchain-based searchable\nencryption solutions, which are one specific use case of cloud computing\nservices. These solutions rely on Blockchain to achieve both the standard\nprivacy property and the new fairness property, which requires that search\noperations are carried out faithfully and are rewarded accordingly.

The significance of these experiments heavily\ndepends on the representativeness of artificial topologies. Indeed, if they\nwere not drawn fairly, obtained results would apply only to a subset of\npossible configurations, hence they would lack of the appropriate generality\nrequired to port them to the real world. Although using many TGs could mitigate\nthis issue by generating topologies in several different ways, that would\nentail a significant additional effort. Hence, the problem arises of what TGs\nto choose, among a number of available generators, to maximise the\nrepresentativeness of generated topologies and reduce the number of TGs to use.\n  In this paper, we address that problem by investigating the presence of bias\nin the initial placement of nodes in artificial WANET topologies produced by\ndifferent TGs.

However, in many\napplications gaining an approximation of the spectrum is not enough. Often it\nis vital to determine geometric features of spectra such as Lebesgue measure,\ncapacity or fractal dimensions, different types of spectral radii and numerical\nranges, or to detect essential spectral gaps and the corresponding failure of\nthe finite section method. Despite new results on computing spectra and the\nsubstantial interest in these geometric problems, there remain no general\nmethods able to compute such geometric features of spectra of\ninfinite-dimensional operators. We provide the first algorithms for the\ncomputation of many of these longstanding problems (including the above). As\ndemonstrated with computational examples, the new algorithms yield a library of\nnew methods. Recent progress in computational spectral problems in infinite\ndimensions has led to the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) hierarchy, which\nclassifies the difficulty of computational problems. These results reveal that\ninfinite-dimensional spectral problems yield an intricate infinite\nclassification theory determining which spectral problems can be solved and\nwith which type of algorithm. This is very much related to S. Smale's\ncomprehensive program on the foundations of computational mathematics initiated\nin the 1980s. We classify the computation of geometric features of spectra in\nthe SCI hierarchy, allowing us to precisely determine the boundaries of what\ncomputers can achieve (in any model of computation) and prove that our\nalgorithms are optimal.

This key feature\nappears only in thin multilayers and it is not inherited from bulk crystals,\nwhere instead neighbouring layers share the same ferromagnetic spin\norientation.

In the numerical analysis\ndifferent implant materials, stem/extension lengths and implant-to-stem\ninterface conditions are considered, from a stiff fully cemented fixation to\nsliding contact conditions with a low friction coefficient.

These two experiments, which coincidentally happened around\nthe same time, allowed determination of the vertical and meridional profiles of\nthe zonal flows on both planets. This paper reviews the topic of zonal jets on\nthe gas giants in light of the new data from these two experiments. The gravity\nmeasurements not only allow the depth of the jets to be constrained, yielding\nthe inference that the jets extend roughly 3000 and 9000 km below the observed\nclouds on Jupiter and Saturn, respectively, but also provide insights into the\nmechanisms controlling these zonal flows. Specifically, for both planets this\ndepth corresponds to the depth where electrical conductivity is within an order\nof magnitude of 1 S/m, implying that the magnetic field likely plays a key role\nin damping the zonal flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 11:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

The general hypothesis of their\nmass loss mechanism is a combination of stellar pulsations and radiative\npressure on dust grains. However, current models simplify dust formation, which\nstarts as a microscopic phase transition called nucleation. Various nucleation\ntheories exist, yet all assume chemical equilibrium, growth restricted by\nmonomers, and commonly use macroscopic properties for a microscopic process.\nSuch simplifications for initial dust formation can have large repercussions on\nthe type, amount, and formation time of dust. By abandoning equilibrium\nassumptions, discarding growth restrictions, and using quantum mechanical\nproperties, we have constructed and investigated an improved nucleation theory\nin AGB wind conditions for four dust candidates, TiO$_2$, MgO, SiO and\nAl$_2$O$_3$. This paper reports the viability of these candidates as first dust\nprecursors and reveals implications of simplified nucleation theories. Monomer\nrestricted growth underpredicts large clusters at low temperatures and\noverpredicts formation times. Assuming the candidates are present, Al$_2$O$_3$\nis the favoured precursor due to its rapid growth at the highest considered\ntemperatures. However, when considering an initially atomic chemical mixture,\nonly TiO$_2$-clusters form. Still, we believe Al$_2$O$_3$ to be the prime\ncandidate due to substantial physical evidence in presolar grains, observations\nof dust around AGB stars at high temperatures, and its ability to form at high\ntemperatures and expect the missing link to be insufficient quantitative data\nof Al-reactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 12:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

We also show that DTML can encode\npreviously discussed dynamics for which finding a complete logic was left open.\nAs complete reduction axioms systems exist for DTML, this yields a complete\nsystem for the dynamics in question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 13:08:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

The sub-class of X-ray\ntransient sources show multifrequency behaviour which deserve particular\nattention in order to understand the causing physics. These binary systems\nconsist of a compact star and an optical star, therefore there is a mutual\ninfluence between these two stars that drive the low energy (LE) (i.e. radio,\nIR, optical) and high energy (HE) (i.e. UV, X-ray, $\\gamma$-ray) processes. The\nLE processes are produced mostly on the optical star and the HE processes\nmostly on the compact star, typically a neutron star. Thus it appears evident\nthat through the study of LE processes it is possible to understand also the HE\nprocesses and vice versa. In this paper we will discuss this problem starting\nfrom the experimental evidence of a delay between LE and HE processes detected\nfor the first time in the X-ray/Be system A0535+26/HDE245770 (e.g. Giovannelli\n\\& Sabau-Graziati, 2011; Giovannelli, Bisnovatyi-Kogan \\& Klepnev, 2013 (here\nafter GBK13); Giovannelli et al., 2015b).

Unconventional ferroelectric switching\nin $\\epsilon$-Fe2O3 films, a material that combines ferrimagnetism and\nferroelectricity at room temperature, is reported here. High-resolution in-situ\nscanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) experiments and\nfirst-principles calculations demonstrate that polarization reversal in\n$\\epsilon$-Fe2O3 occurs around pre-existing domain walls only, triggering local\ndomain wall motion in moderate electric fields of 250 - 500 kV/cm. Calculations\nindicate that the activation barrier for switching at domain walls is nearly a\nquarter of that corresponding to the most likely transition paths inside\n$\\epsilon$-Fe2O3 domains. Moreover, domain walls provide symmetry lowering,\nwhich is shown to be necessary for ferroelectric switching. Local polarization\nreversal in $\\epsilon$-Fe2O3 limits the macroscopic ferroelectric response and\noffers important hints on how to tailor ferroelectric properties by domain\nstructure design in other relevant ferroelectric materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 14:00:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

Despite two decades of investigations, one of the big\nopen questions is to obtain an experimental determination of the temperature\nreached in a heavy-ion collision, and a simultaneous determination of another\nthermodynamic quantity, such as the entropy density, that would give access to\nthe number of degrees of freedom.

A framework in which all the experimental outcomes arise\nfrom unitary evolutions is proposed. Within it, a measurement is not completed\nuntil an uncontrolled environment monitorizes the state composed by the system,\nthe apparatus and the observer. The (apparent) wave-function collapse and the\ncorresponding randomness result from tracing out this environment; it is thus\nthe ultimate responsible for the emergence of definite outcomes. Two main\neffects arise from this fact. First, external interference measurements,\ntrademark of Wigner's friend experiments, modify the memory records of the\ninternal observers; this framework provides a univocal protocol to calculate\nall these changes. Second, it can be used to build a consistent scenario for\nthe recenly proposed extended versions of the Wigner's friend experiment.\nRegarding [D. Frauchiger and R.

A variation of this setup, devised to fill this gap, makes it\npossible to assign joint truth values to the observations made by all the\nagents.

In the real world, the class samples follow a long-tailed\ndistribution, and the discriminative information in the sample-scarce seen\nclasses is hard to be transferred to the related unseen classes in the\ntraditional batch-based training manner, which degrades the overall\ngeneralization ability a lot.

To summarize these methodologies of\nurban flows prediction, in this paper, we first introduce four main factors\naffecting urban flows. Second, in order to further analysis urban flows, a\npreparation process of multi-sources spatial-temporal data related with urban\nflows is partitioned into three groups. Third, we choose the spatial-temporal\ndynamic data as a case study for the urban flows prediction task. Fourth, we\nanalyze and compare some well-known and state-of-the-art flows prediction\nmethods in detail, classifying them into five categories: statistics-based,\ntraditional machine learning-based, deep learning-based, reinforcement\nlearning-based and transfer learning-based methods.

One of the most important\nconcerns for network designers is maintaining the high performance of the\nnetwork when the quality of connections between sources and their destinations\nis poor. Thus the careful selection of relays between data sources and their\ndestinations is a very important issue. The possibility of simultaneous use of\ndifferent Radio Frequency (RF) interfaces for transmitting data, which\ncommunication devices are equipped with them, can increase the capacity of data\ntransmission over the network. In this paper, two novel M2M relay selection\nalgorithms are proposed, named as Optimal Relay Selection Algorithm (ORSA) and\nMatching based Relay Selection Algorithm (MRSA). ORSA is a centralized\nalgorithm for the optimal selection of relays by transforming the main problem\nto a k-cardinality assignment problem that can be solved using the Hungarian\nalgorithm. MRSA is a distributed algorithm that leverages concepts from\nmatching theory to provide a stable solution for the relay selection problem.\nIn both proposed algorithms static RF interfaces usage is applied to enable\nsimultaneous use of different interfaces for data transmission. The simulations\nshow that ORSA is optimally solving the relay selection problem. MRSA has an\noptimal stable result, that when there is no restriction on the number of\nchannels, is only about 1% lower than ORSA.

Public discussion on\nincidents and events -- controversies -- of companies can provide valuable\ninsights on how well the company operates with regards to social consciousness\nand indicate the company's overall operational capability. However, there are\nchallenges in evaluating the degree of a company's social consciousness and\nenvironmental sustainability due to the lack of systematic data. We introduce a\nsystem that utilizes Twitter data to detect and monitor controversial events\nand show their impact on market volatility. In our study, controversial events\nare identified from clustered tweets that share the same 5W terms and sentiment\npolarities of these clusters. Credible news links inside the event tweets are\nused to validate the truth of the event. A case study on the Starbucks\nPhiladelphia arrests shows that this method can provide the desired\nfunctionality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2019 18:36:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-15"}

The Einstein-Maxwell's field equations have\nbeen written in the framework of Rastall-Rainbow gravity. The gravastar\nconsists of three regions: interior region, thin shell region and exterior\nregion. In the interior region, the gravastar follows the equation of sate\n(EoS) $p=-\\rho$ and we have found the solutions of all physical quantities like\nenergy density, pressure, electric field, charge density, gravitational mass\nand metric coefficients. In the exterior region, we have obtained the exterior\nRiessner-Nordstrom solution for vacuum model ($p=\\rho=0$). Since in the shell\nregion, the fluid source follows the EoS $p=\\rho$ (ultra-stiff fluid) and the\nthickness of the shell of the gravastar is infinitesimal, so by the\napproximation $h~(\\equiv A^{-1})\\ll 1$, we have found the analytical solutions\nwithin the thin shell. The physical quantities like the proper length of the\nthin shell, entropy and energy content inside the thin shell of the charged\ngravastar have been computed and we have shown that they are directly\nproportional to the proper thickness of the shell ($\\epsilon$) due to the\napproximation ($\\epsilon\\ll 1$). The physical parameters significantly depend\non the Rastall parameter and Rainbow function. Next we have studied the\nmatching between the surfaces of interior and exterior regions of the charged\ngravastar and using the matching conditions, the surface energy density and the\nsurface pressure have been obtained. Also the equation of state parameter on\nthe surface, mass of the thin shell, mass of the gravastar have been obtained.\nFinally, we have explored the stable regions of the charged gravastar in\nRastall-Rainbow gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 15:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}
