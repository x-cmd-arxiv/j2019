On a manifold\nwith a boundary, we will show that the (1+1)-dimensional Lifshitz Weyl anomaly\ncan be derived from a specific term, the torsional CS (tCS) term, in the NRSCS\naction built from the gauge fields of the Weyl and special conformal symmetry\ngenerators of the centrally-extended Schr$\\mathrm{\\ddot{o}}$dinger algebra. We\nalso focus on the $z=1$ Lifshitz Weyl anomaly and attempt to elicit its\ngeometric and physical nature, in particular its relationship with the Lorentz\nanomaly of a (1+1)-dimensional CFT effective actions. We show that it is\ndirectly related to the curvature scalar of the dual Lorentz connection, the\nintegral of which is known to be a topological invariant. We also point out\nthat making the anomalous Lifshitz quantum effective action Weyl-invariant\namounts to obtaining the equation of motion for a stationary chiral boson which\nhappens to be the spatial-component of the acceleration vector. By putting\nboundary conditions on the spatial slices, the time dependence of the lapse\nfunction in the Arnowitt, Deser and Misner (ADM) decomposition is eliminated\nand the result is a Rindler metric.

We investigate the s-process during the AGB phase of stellar models\nwhose cores are enforced to rotate at rates consistent with asteroseismology\nobservations of their progenitors and successors. Methods. We calculated new\n2M$_{\\odot}$, Z=0.01 models, rotating at 0, 125, and 250 km/s at the start of\nmain sequence. An artificial, additional viscosity was added to enhance the\ntransport of angular momentum in order to reduce the core rotation rates to be\nin agreement with asteroseismology observations. We compared rotation rates of\nour models with observed rotation rates during the MS up to the end of core He\nburning, and the white dwarf phase. Results. We present nucleosynthesis\ncalculations for these rotating AGB models that were enforced to match the\nasteroseismic constraints on rotation rates of MS, RGB, He-burning, and WD\nstars. In particular, we calculated one model that matches the upper limit of\nobserved rotation rates of core He-burning stars and we also included a model\nthat rotates one order of magnitude faster than the upper limit of the\nobservations. The s-process production in both of these models is comparable to\nthat of non-rotating models. Conclusions. Slowing down the core rotation rate\nin stars to match the above mentioned asteroseismic constraints reduces the\nrotationally induced mixing processes to the point that they have no effect on\nthe s-process nucleosynthesis. This result is independent of the initial\nrotation rate of the stellar evolution model. However, there are uncertainties\nremaining in the treatment of rotation in stellar evolution, which need to be\nreduced in order to confirm our conclusions, including the physical nature of\nour approach to reduce the core rotation rates of our models, and magnetic\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2019 16:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

The economic inefficiency of\ncollecting accurate prior maps for navigation motivates the use of planning\nalgorithms that operate in unmapped environments. However, these algorithms\ntypically waste time exploring regions that are unlikely to contain the\ndelivery destination. Context is key information about structured environments\nthat could guide exploration toward the unknown goal location, but the abstract\nidea is difficult to quantify for use in a planning algorithm. Some approaches\nspecifically consider contextual relationships between objects, but would\nperform poorly in object-sparse environments like outdoors. Recent deep\nlearning-based approaches consider context too generally, making\ntraining/transferability difficult. Therefore, this work proposes a novel\nformulation of utilizing context for planning as an image-to-image translation\nproblem, which is shown to extract terrain context from semantic gridmaps, into\na metric that an exploration-based planner can use.

Since this question is of practical importance for the\noccurrence of cycle-to-cycle variations in spark ignition engines, the\nobjective of the present work is to fundamentally differentiate early flame\nkernel development from well-established turbulent flame configurations. For\nthis purpose, a DNS database consisting of three flames propagating in\nhomogeneous isotropic turbulence (Falkenstein et al., Combust. Flame, 2019) is\nconsidered. The flames feature different ratios of the initially laminar flame\ndiameter to the integral length scale. To quantify flame kernel development,\nthe time evolution of flame topology and flame front geometry are analysed in\ndetail. It is shown that some realizations of the early flame kernel are\nsubstantially influenced by high compressive strain caused by large-scale\nturbulent flow motion with characteristic length scales greater than the flame\nkernel size. As a result, the initial spherical kernel topology may become\nhighly distorted, which is reflected in the stochastic occurrence of excessive\ncurvature variance. Two mechanisms of curvature production resulting from early\nflame kernel/turbulence interactions are identified by analysis of the mean\ncurvature balance equation. Further, it is shown that the curvature\ndistribution of small flame kernels becomes strongly skewed towards positive\ncurvatures, which is contrary to developed turbulent flames. Hence, the\ntransition of ignition kernels to self-sustaining turbulent flames is very\ndifferent in nature compared with the development of a statistically planar\nflame brush.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2019 18:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

Campaigns are\nseeded with sponsored ads to some users, but no user must be exposed to too\nmany sponsored ads. Thus, while ad campaigns proceed independently over the\nnetwork, they need to be carefully coordinated with respect to their seed sets.\n  We study the objective of maximizing host's total ad revenue. Our main result\nis to show that under a broad class of influence models, the problem can be\nreduced to maximizing a submodular function subject to two matroid constraints;\nit can therefore be approximated within a factor essentially 1/2 in polynomial\ntime.

However, they are hard to handle for machine learning algorithms due to\ntheir unordered structure. One common approach is to apply occupancy grid\nmapping, which dramatically increases the amount of data stored and at the same\ntime loses details through discretization. Recently, deep learning models were\nproposed to handle point clouds directly and achieve input permutation\ninvariance. However, these architectures often use an increased number of\nparameters and are computationally inefficient. In this work, we propose basis\npoint sets (BPS) as a highly efficient and fully general way to process point\nclouds with machine learning algorithms. The basis point set representation is\na residual representation that can be computed efficiently and can be used with\nstandard neural network architectures and other machine learning algorithms.\nUsing the proposed representation as the input to a simple fully connected\nnetwork allows us to match the performance of PointNet on a shape\nclassification task while using three orders of magnitude less floating-point\noperations. In a second experiment, we show how the proposed representation can\nbe used for registering high-resolution meshes to noisy 3D scans.

In this paper, we present a two-fluid model for fast solar wind\nwith anisotropic Kappa-Maxwellian electrons and Bi-Maxwellian protons.

A set of eleven coupled equations is derived by\napplying the zeroth- to fourth-order moments of the Vlasov equation and the\nmodified electromagnetic Maxwell equations. A characteristic of the Kappa\ndistribution (indicated by $\\kappa$ index) is explicit in the equation for the\nparallel component of the electron heat flux (parallel to the ambient magnetic\nfield line) and differs from the equation derived for the proton heat flux due\nto the different nature of the distributions. Within the large $\\kappa$ index,\nthe equations for the two-fluid model tend to the equations obtained by the\nMaxwellian distribution. Using an iterated Crank-Nicolson method, the coupled\nequations are numerically solved for the fast solar wind conditions. We show\nthat at (0.3 - 1) AU from the Sun, the electron density, components of\ntemperature, and components of heat flux follow the power-law behavior.

The\nevaluation showed above 99% similarity in terms of multi-scale structural\nsimilarity (MS-SSIM) when the compression ratio is as high as 40. Furthermore,\nthe reconstructed images of compression ratio 80 from the proposed framework\neven have better quality than that of compression ratio 20 from JPEG by visual\ncomparison. The testing result outperforms JPEG in term of both of MS-SSIM and\nvisualization, which is more obvious as the increase of compression ratio. Our\npreliminary result indicates the huge potential of deep neural networks on\ncustomized medical image compression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2019 21:38:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 15:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

To address this issue, we propose a novel Dynamic\nKernel Distillation (DKD) model to facilitate small networks for estimating\nhuman poses in videos, thus significantly lifting the efficiency. In\nparticular, DKD introduces a light-weight distillator to online distill pose\nkernels via leveraging temporal cues from the previous frame in a one-shot\nfeed-forward manner. Then, DKD simplifies body joint localization into a\nmatching procedure between the pose kernels and the current frame, which can be\nefficiently computed via simple convolution. In this way, DKD fast transfers\npose knowledge from one frame to provide compact guidance for body joint\nlocalization in the following frame, which enables utilization of small\nnetworks in video-based pose estimation. To facilitate the training process,\nDKD exploits a temporally adversarial training strategy that introduces a\ntemporal discriminator to help generate temporally coherent pose kernels and\npose estimation results within a long range. Experiments on Penn Action and\nSub-JHMDB benchmarks demonstrate outperforming efficiency of DKD, specifically,\n10x flops reduction and 2x speedup over previous best model, and its\nstate-of-the-art accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2019 21:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

Existing methods are\nmostly two-stage based--one stage for proposal generation and the other for\nallocating poses to corresponding persons.

In this work, we present the first\nsingle-stage model, Single-stage multi-person Pose Machine (SPM), to simplify\nthe pipeline and lift the efficiency for multi-person pose estimation. To\nachieve this, we propose a novel Structured Pose Representation (SPR) that\nunifies person instance and body joint position representations. Based on SPR,\nwe develop the SPM model that can directly predict structured poses for\nmultiple persons in a single stage, and thus offer a more compact pipeline and\nattractive efficiency advantage over two-stage methods. In particular, SPR\nintroduces the root joints to indicate different person instances and human\nbody joint positions are encoded into their displacements w.r.t. the roots. To\nbetter predict long-range displacements for some joints, SPR is further\nextended to hierarchical representations. Based on SPR, SPM can efficiently\nperform multi-person poses estimation by simultaneously predicting root joints\n(location of instances) and body joint displacements via CNNs. Moreover, to\ndemonstrate the generality of SPM, we also apply it to multi-person 3D pose\nestimation.

Real-world data show that approximately 50% of psoriasis patients\ntreated with a biologic agent will discontinue the drug because of loss of\nefficacy. History of previous therapy with another biologic, female sex and\nobesity were identified as predictors of drug discontinuations, but their\nindividual predictive value is low. Objectives. To determine whether machine\nlearning algorithms can produce models that can accurately predict outcomes of\nbiologic therapy in psoriasis on individual patient level. Results. All tested\nmachine learning algorithms could accurately predict the risk of drug\ndiscontinuation and its cause (e.g. lack of efficacy vs adverse event). The\nlearned generalized linear model achieved diagnostic accuracy of 82%, requiring\nunder 2 seconds per patient using the psoriasis patients dataset. Input\noptimization analysis established a profile of a patient who has best chances\nof long-term treatment success: biologic-naive patient under 49 years,\nearly-onset plaque psoriasis without psoriatic arthritis, weight < 100 kg, and\nmoderate-to-severe psoriasis activity (DLQI $\\geq$ 16; PASI $\\geq$ 10).\nMoreover, a different generalized linear model is used to predict the length of\ntreatment for each patient with mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.5 months.\nHowever Pearson Correlation Coefficient indicates 0.935 linear dependencies\nbetween the actual treatment lengths and predicted ones. Conclusions. Machine\nlearning algorithms predict the risk of drug discontinuation and treatment\nduration with accuracy exceeding 80%, based on a small set of predictive\nvariables. This approach can be used as a decision-making tool, communicating\nexpected outcomes to the patient, and development of evidence-based guidelines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2019 05:07:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

Dependence of reversal times on\ntemperature and different widths of the distributions of random fields are also\nreported.

For\nlarger width of the distribution of random field, the system fails to show the\nreversal via the nucleation of a single droplet (for small values of uniform\nfield only).

It separates the specification of application logic (in\na dataflow graph) from the execution of the logic. TensorFlow's native runtime\nexecutes the application with low overhead across a diverse set of hardware\nincluding CPUs, GPUs, and ASICs. Although the underlying dataflow engine\nsupporting these features could be applied to computations beyond machine\nlearning, certain design decisions limit this broader application, such as the\ninability for an application to differentiate between data items across\nconcurrent requests.\n  This paper introduces Pipelined TensorFlow (PTF), a system that extends\nTensorFlow's semantics to provide support for a broader variety of application\nlogic. In particular, PTF supports applications that concurrently process\nfinite batches of data on a single instantiation. PTF adds these semantics by\npartitioning the dataflow graph into a pipeline of smaller graphs and tagging\neach data item with metadata. These smaller graphs are separated by gates: new\ndata structures in PTF that buffer data items between graphs and interpret the\nmetadata to apply the new semantics. PTF's pipeline architecture executes on an\nunmodified TensorFlow runtime, maintaining compatibility with many existing\nTensorFlow library functions. Our evaluation shows that the pipelining\nmechanism of PTF can increase the throughput of a bioinformatics application by\n4$\\times$ while only increasing its latency by 0.13$\\times$.

At late times, the rate of change of complexity is essentially\ndetermined by the generalised Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term evaluated at\nthe future singularity. In particular, its ratio to black hole mass is a\ncharacteristic constant, independent of the higher order couplings. Thus, in\nthe vanishing coupling limit, the result in general does not reduce to that of\nSchwarzschild black holes, in spite of that the metric reduces to the latter as\nwell as the gravitational action.

Results. Unexpectedly,\ncode quality turned out not to affect the acceptance of a pull request at all.\nAs suggested by other works, other factors such as the reputation of the\nmaintainer and the importance of the feature delivered might be more important\nthan code quality in terms of pull request acceptance. Conclusions. Researchers\nalready investigated the influence of the developers' reputation and the pull\nrequest acceptance. This is the first work investigating if quality of the code\nin pull requests affects the acceptance of the pull request or not. We\nrecommend that researchers further investigate this topic to understand if\ndifferent measures or different tools could provide some useful measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2019 13:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

Given there are\nthousands of languages in the world and some of them are very different, it is\nextremely burdensome to handle them all in a single model or use a separate\nmodel for each language pair. Therefore, given a fixed resource budget, e.g.,\nthe number of models, how to determine which languages should be supported by\none model is critical to multilingual NMT, which, unfortunately, has been\nignored by previous work. In this work, we develop a framework that clusters\nlanguages into different groups and trains one multilingual model for each\ncluster. We study two methods for language clustering: (1) using prior\nknowledge, where we cluster languages according to language family, and (2)\nusing language embedding, in which we represent each language by an embedding\nvector and cluster them in the embedding space. In particular, we obtain the\nembedding vectors of all the languages by training a universal neural machine\ntranslation model.

We analyze the problem of determining whether the\nweight of a given cycle can be decreased by a popular $k$-opt move. Earlier\nwork has shown that (i) assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis, there is no\nalgorithm to find an improving $k$-opt move in time $f(k)n^{o(k/\\log k)}$ for\nany function $f$, while (ii) it is possible to improve on the brute-force\nrunning time of $O(n^k)$ and save linear factors in the exponent. Modern TSP\nheuristics show that very good global solutions can already be reached using\nonly the top-$O(1)$ most promising edges incident to each vertex. Motivated by\nthis, we study the problem of finding an improving $k$-move in bounded degree\ngraphs, presenting new algorithms and conditional lower bounds. We show that\nthe aforementioned ETH lower bound also holds for graphs of maximum degree\nthree, but that in bounded-degree graphs the best improving $k$-move can be\nfound in time $O(n^{23k/135+o(k)})$. This improves upon the best-known bounds\nfor general graphs. Due to its practical importance, we devote special\nattention to the range of $k$ in which improving $k$-moves in bounded-degree\ngraphs can be found in quasi-linear time. For $k\\le 7$, we give quasi-linear\ntime algorithms for general weights. For $k=8$ we obtain a quasi-linear time\nalgorithm for polylogarithmic weights. On the other hand, based on established\nfine-grained complexity hypotheses, we prove that the $k=9$ case does not admit\nquasi-linear time algorithms. Hence we fully characterize the values of $k$ for\nwhich quasi-linear time algorithms exist for polylogarithmic weights on\nbounded-degree graphs. As a byproduct, we show a new bound on pathwidth of even\ngraphs which results in improved running time bounds for counting $k$-vertex\npaths and cycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2019 13:28:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 2019 07:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Their inherent nonlinearity and sensitivity to small\nperturbations make them challenging to study, particularly in the presence of\nexternal driving, which can alter the relative stability of different\nattractors. Under such circumstances, one may ask whether any clear\nrelationship holds between the specific pattern of external driving and the\nparticular attractor states selected by a driven multistable system. To gain\ninsight into this question, we numerically study driven disordered mechanical\nnetworks of bistable springs which possess a vast number of stable\nconfigurations arising from the two stable rest lengths of each spring, thereby\ncapturing the essential physical properties of a broad class of multistable\nsystems.

This structure was based on two\ngeneralizations of the traditional relational model: (1) A tuple component can\nbe any subset of the corresponding domain, rather than a single element and (2)\nA similarity relation is defined on each domain. This relation satisfies the\nproperties of reflexivity, symmetry and max-min transitivity, thus having the\nequality relation as a special case. This generalization keeps two key\nproperties of the relational model - that no two different tuples represent the\nsame information and that the application of any operation of the relation\nalgebra has a unique result.\n  Shenoi and Melton generalized this model and showed how the existence of\nequivalence classes over the attribute domains can also be preserved with a\nrelation that only satisfies the properties of reflexivity and symmetry\n(proximity relation). The motivation for this generalization is the strictness\nof the max-min transitivity property of similarity relations, which complicates\nthe construction of this relation for some domain types.\n  An important characteristic of the Shenoi-Melton model is the dependence of\nthe equivalence classes upon the current content of the database. This\ncharacteristic, together with the way the equivalence relation is constructed\nby the proximity relation, can lead to the equivalence classes that don't\ncorrespond well with some database query types.\n  Here we will present a different way of forming the equivalence classes over\nthe attribute domains in fuzzy relational databases in which they depend only\non the attribute domain and not on the current database state.

Dual systems are\nrelated by duality transforms. All mechanical systems that are dual to each\nother form a duality family.

This newly coupled methodologies are used to\nstudy the motion of a spherical particle driven by a constant body force in a\nconfined channel with a fixed square cross-section. The channel is filled with\na mixture of two liquids under the effect of thermal fluctuations. After some\nvalidations steps in absence of fluctuations, we study the fluctuations in the\nparticle's velocity at changing thermal energy, applied force, particle size,\nand particle wettability. The importance of fluctuations with respect to the\nmean settling velocity is quantitatively assessed, especially in comparison to\nunconfined situations. Results show that the expected effects of confinement\nare very well captured by the numerical simulations, wherein the confinement\nstrongly enhances the importance of velocity fluctuations, which can be one\norder of magnitude larger than what expected in unconfined domains. The\nobserved findings underscore the versatility of the proposed methodology in\nhighlighting the effects of confinement on the motion of particles in presence\nof thermal fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 2019 09:30:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 18:41:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2022 19:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}
