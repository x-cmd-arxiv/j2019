In order to gradually tune the Sr-doping level\nalong the axis perpendicular to the samples we have grown a series of bilayers\nwith different thicknesses of low-doped manganites (from 0 nm to 6 nm)\ndeposited over a La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 metallic layer.

We found that the\nantiferromagnetic spin axis points preferentially out of the sample plane\nregardless the capping layer thickness. However, it tilts partially into the\nsample plane far from this critical thickness, owing to the jointed\ncontributions of the external structural strain and electron doping.\nFurthermore, we found that the doping level of the capping layer sensibly\naffects the critical thickness, giving clear evidence of the influence exerted\nby the electron doping on the orbital and magnetic configurations.

Using the combination of those basic\nfunctions, it is possible to construct a wide class of functions. The user\nwishes to compute a particular combination of the basic functions, by\noffloading the computation to $N$ servers, while the servers should not obtain\nany information about which combination of the basic functions is to be\ncomputed. The objective is to minimize the total number of queries asked by the\nuser from the servers to achieve the desired result.\n  As a first step toward this problem, in this paper, we consider the case\nwhere the user is interested in a class of functions which are composition of\nthe basic functions, while each basic function appears in the composition\nexactly once. This means that in this case, to ensure privacy, we only require\nto hide to the order of the basic functions in the desired composition of the\nuser. We further assume that the basic functions are linear and can be\nrepresented by (possibly large-scale) matrices. We call this problem as private\nsequential function computation. We study the capacity $C$, defined as the\nsupremum of the number of desired computations, normalized by the number of\ncomputations done at the servers, subject to the privacy constraint. We prove\nthat $(1-\\frac{1}{N})/ (1-\\frac{1}{\\max(K,N)}) \\le C \\le 1$. For the\nachievability, we show that the user can retrieve the desired order of\ncomposition, by choosing a proper order of inquiries among different servers,\nwhile keeping the order of computations for each server fixed, irrespective of\nthe desired order of composition. In the end, we develop an\ninformation-theoretic converse which results in an upper bound on the capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Aug 2019 17:32:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2020 01:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

Representation\nlearning presents an attractive opportunity to model the dynamic evolution of\nusers and items, where each user/item can be embedded in a Euclidean space and\nits evolution can be modeled by an embedding trajectory in this space. However,\nexisting dynamic embedding methods generate embeddings only when users take\nactions and do not explicitly model the future trajectory of the user/item in\nthe embedding space. Here we propose JODIE, a coupled recurrent neural network\nmodel that learns the embedding trajectories of users and items. JODIE employs\ntwo recurrent neural networks to update the embedding of a user and an item at\nevery interaction. Crucially, JODIE also models the future embedding trajectory\nof a user/item. To this end, it introduces a novel projection operator that\nlearns to estimate the embedding of the user at any time in the future. These\nestimated embeddings are then used to predict future user-item interactions. To\nmake the method scalable, we develop a t-Batch algorithm that creates\ntime-consistent batches and leads to 9x faster training. We conduct six\nexperiments to validate JODIE on two prediction tasks---future interaction\nprediction and state change prediction---using four real-world datasets.

We\nbuild a low-energy effective model and show that the lowest hydrodynamic mode\ncarries a portion of the heat flux quantum which is the same both at $\\nu = 1$\nand $\\nu = 2$. Although our results are consistent with the experiment, a\nmicroscopic model of dissipation is needed to confirm the prediction of the\nlow-energy approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Aug 2019 18:20:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}

We\nconsider the case that the new-physics spectrum has a little hierarchy with two\nparticle mass scales m1, m2 and m2 = O(10 m1) and no tree-level couplings of\nthe heavier particles to Higgs doublets. As a concrete example we study the\n(next-to-)minimal supersymmetric standard model ((N)MSSM) for the case that the\ngluino mass M3 is significantly larger than the stop mass parameters m_{L,R}\nand show that the usual one-loop fine-tuning analysis breaks down. If m_{L,R}\nis defined in the dimensional-reduction (DR-bar) or any other fundamental\nscheme, corrections enhanced by powers of M3^2/m_{L,R}^2 occur in all higher\nloop orders. After resumming these terms we find the fine-tuning measure\nsubstantially improved compared to the usual analyses with M3 <~ m_{L,R}. In\nour hierarchical scenario the stop self-energies grow like M3^2, so that the\nstop masses m_{L,R}^{OS} in the on-shell (OS) scheme are naturally much larger\nthan their DR-bar counterparts m_{L,R}^{DR-bar}. This feature permits a novel\nsolution to the little fine-tuning problem: DR-bar stop masses are close to the\nelectroweak scale, but radiative corrections involving the heavy gluino push\nthe OS masses, which are probed in collider searches, above their experimental\nlower limits. As a byproduct, we clarify which renormalization scheme must be\nused for squark masses in loop corrections to low-energy quantities such as the\nB-B-bar mixing amplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Aug 2019 19:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}

In these\ncases it is difficult to analyze the eigenvectors of the data matrix. To\naddress this issue, we propose simple estimators of the latent factors using\ncross-sectional projections of the panel data, by weighted averages with\npre-determined weights.

In practice,\nwith a careful characterization of quantum sources and the decoy-state method,\nmeasure-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) provides secure\nkey distribution. While short-distance fibre-based QKD has already been\navailable for real-life implementation, the bottleneck of practical QKD lies on\nthe limited transmission distance. Due to photon losses in transmission, it was\nbelieved that the key generation rate is bounded by a linear function of the\nchannel transmittance, $O(\\eta)$, without a quantum repeater, which puts an\nupper bound on the maximal secure transmission distance. Interestingly, a new\nphase-encoding MDI-QKD scheme, named twin-field QKD, has been suggested to beat\nthe linear bound, while another variant, named phase-matching quantum key\ndistribution (PM-QKD), has been proven to have a quadratic key-rate\nimprovement, $O(\\sqrt{\\eta})$. In reality, however, the intrinsic optical mode\nmismatch of independent lasers, accompanied by phase fluctuation and drift,\nimpedes the successful experimental implementation of the new schemes. Here, we\nsolve this problem with the assistance of the laser injection technique and the\nphase post-compensation method. In the experiment, the key rate surpasses the\nlinear key-rate bound via 302 km and 402 km commercial-fibre channels,\nachieving a key rate over 4 orders of magnitude higher than the existing\nresults in literature. Furthermore, with a 502 km ultralow-loss fibre, our\nsystem yields a secret key rate of 0.118 bps. We expect this new type of QKD\nschemes to become a new standard for future QKD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Aug 2019 04:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

Existing data-driven prediction approaches for DDIs typically rely\non a single source of information, while using information from multiple\nsources would help improve predictions.

Currently, it is common to conduct AQA using deep neural\nnetworks that require fixed-size inputs. Existing methods mainly transform\nimages by resizing, cropping, and padding or employ adaptive pooling to\nalternately capture the aesthetic features from fixed-size inputs. However,\nthese transformations potentially damage aesthetic features. To address this\nissue, we propose a simple but effective method to accomplish full-resolution\nimage AQA by combining image padding with region of image (RoM) pooling.\nPadding turns inputs into the same size. RoM pooling pools image features and\ndiscards extra padded features to eliminate the side effects of padding. In\naddition, the image aspect ratios are encoded and fused with visual features to\nremedy the shape information loss of RoM pooling. Furthermore, we observe that\nthe same image may receive different aesthetic evaluations under different\nthemes, which we call theme criterion bias. Hence, a theme-aware model that\nuses theme information to guide model predictions is proposed. Finally, we\ndesign an attention-based feature fusion module to effectively utilize both the\nshape and theme information.

In practice, however, covariate values may\nbe missing for some data subjects. To handle missing values, analysts can use\nimputation methods to create completed datasets, from which they can estimate\ntreatment effects. Common imputation methods include mean imputation, single\nimputation via regression, and multiple imputation. For each of these methods,\nwe investigate the benefits of leveraging randomized treatment assignment in\nthe imputation routines, that is, making use of the fact that the true\ncovariate distributions are the same across treatment arms. We do so using\nsimulation studies that compare the quality of inferences when we respect or\ndisregard the randomization.

The vision is to automate the process from the time an\nincident/ticket arrives till it is resolved and closed.

The ASNet is a neural network architecture that exploits the\nrelational structure of (P)PDDL planning problems to learn a common set of\nweights that can be applied to any problem in a domain. By mimicking the\nactions chosen by a traditional, non-learning planner on a handful of small\nproblems in a domain, ASNets are able to learn a generalised reactive policy\nthat can quickly solve much larger instances from the domain. This work extends\nthe ASNet architecture to make it more expressive, while still remaining\ninvariant to a range of symmetries that exist in PPDDL problems. We also\npresent a thorough experimental evaluation of ASNets, including a comparison\nwith heuristic search planners on seven probabilistic and deterministic\ndomains, an extended evaluation on over 18,000 Blocksworld instances, and an\nablation study.

Examples of such\nspaces appear everywhere in topology and geometry. The study of stratified\nspaces involves invariants such as intersection cohomology which are only\ninvariants under stratification-preserving homotopies. In this thesis, we study\nthe homotopy theory of stratified spaces with respect to those stratified\nhomotopies. To do so, we construct model categories for stratified spaces and\nwe introduce new invariants to characterize them, the filtered homotopy groups.\nA stratified space can be seen as a topological space $X$ together with a\ncontinuous map to a poset of strata $X\\to P$. We begin our study by restricting\nourselves to the filtered case, where the poset of strata is fixed. We define\nthe model category of filtered simplicial sets, show that it admits a\ndescription \"\\`a la Kan\", and characterize its weak-equivalences using the\nfiltered homotopy groups. We deduce a proof of a filtered version of Whitehead\ntheorem. We then construct a model category of filtered spaces. Its\nweak-equivalences are the morphisms that induce isomorphisms on all filtered\nhomotopy groups, and its fibrations satisfy a filtered version of Serre's\nlifting conditions. We show that it is Quillen-equivalent to a category of\ndiagrams of simplicial sets. We then work toward a comparison between the model\ncategories of filtered simplicial sets and of filtered spaces. They are\nconnected by a Quillen-adjunction, similar to the classical Kan-Quillen\nadjunction. We conjecture that it is in fact a Quillen equivalence. Lastly,\nworking with the notion of Quillen bifibration, we show that there are model\ncategories of stratified spaces and of stratified simplicial sets.

From this perspective, we propose a novel direct feature odometry\nframework, named DFO, for depth estimation and hierarchical feature\nrepresentation learning from monocular videos.

The information in virtual environments is perceived by sight, sound\nand touch, but the relationship or impact that these stimuli can have on the\noscillatory activity of the brain such as the processing, propagation and\nsynchronization of information still needs to be established in relation to the\ncognitive load of attention. Therefore, this study seeks to identify the\nsuggested epistemological basis through literature review and current research\nagendas in the relationship that exists between the immersive virtual\nenvironment and the neurophysiology of learning processes by means of the\nanalysis of visual information. The suggested dimensional modeling of this\nresearch is composed by the theory of information processing which allows the\nincorporation of learning through stimuli with the use of attention, perception\nand storage by means of information management and the Kolb's learning model\nwhich defines the perception and processing of information as dimensions of\nlearning. Regarding to the neurophysiology of learning, the literature has\nestablished he links between the prefrontal cortex and working memory within\nthe process of information management. The challenges and advances discussed in\nthis research are based in the relationship between the identified constructs\n(Income Stimuli, Information Management and Cognitive Processing) and the\nestablishment of a research agenda on how to identify the necessary indicators\nto measure memory and attention in the virtual immersion environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Aug 2019 05:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

Although numerical models\nhave been widely used for analyzing rate and state friction, in general they\nconsider infinite elastic domains surrounding the sliding interface and rely on\nboundary integral formulations. Much less work has been dedicated to modeling\nfinite size systems to account for interactions with boundaries. This paper\ninvestigates rate and state frictional interfaces in the context of finite size\nsystems with the finite element method in explicit dynamics. We investigate the\nlong term behavior of the sliding interface for two different friction laws: a\nvelocity weakening law, for which the friction monotonously decreases with\nincreasing sliding velocity, and a velocity weakening-strengthening law, for\nwhich the friction coefficient first decreases but then increases above a\ncritical velocity. We show that for both friction laws at finite times, that is\nbefore wave reflections from the boundaries come back to the sliding interface,\na temporary steady state sliding is reached, with a well-defined stress drop at\nthe interface. This stress drop gives rise to a stress concentration and leads\nto an analogy between friction and fracture. However, at longer times, that is\nafter multiple wave reflections, the stress drop is essentially zero, resulting\nin losing the analogy with fracture mechanics. Finally, the simulations reveal\nthat velocity weakening is unstable at long time scales, as it results in an\nacceleration of the sliding blocks. On the other hand, velocity\nweakening-strengthening reaches a steady state sliding configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Aug 2019 21:27:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

In this article, we\npropose a novel learning strategy based on neuroevolution to design and train\nthe ONNs. Two typical neuroevolution algorithms are used to determine the\nhyper-parameters of the ONNs and to optimize the weights (phase shifters) in\nthe connections. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the training\nalgorithms, the trained ONNs are applied in the classification tasks for iris\nplants dataset, wine recognition dataset and modulation formats recognition.\nThe calculated results exhibit that the training algorithms based on\nneuroevolution are competitive with other traditional learning algorithms on\nboth accuracy and stability.

This\ntheory will encompass process algebra, temporal logic and semantic models.

Contemporary process algebras\nand temporal logics fail to make distinctions between systems of which one has\na crucial liveness property and the other does not, at least when assuming\njustness, a strong progress property, but not assuming fairness. Setting up an\nalternative framework involves giving up on identifying strongly bisimilar\nsystems, inventing new induction principles, developing new axiomatic bases for\nprocess algebras and new congruence formats for operational semantics, and\ncreating matching treatments of time and probability. Even simple systems like\nfair schedulers or mutual exclusion protocols cannot be accurately specified in\nstandard process algebras (or Petri nets) in the absence of fairness\nassumptions.
