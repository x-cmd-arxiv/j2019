As\nit turns out, numerous replication studies have been carried out based on that\nwork, which have both confirmed prior findings and shined new light on our\nunderstanding of human perception.

To mitigate this\nincreased computation, we focus on the GRU cells and quantize the feedforward\nprocedure with binarized values and bitwise operations. The BGRU network is\ntrained in two stages. The real-valued weights are pretrained and transferred\nto the bitwise network, which are then incrementally binarized to minimize the\npotential loss that can occur from a sudden introduction of quantization. As\nthe proposed binarization technique turns only a few randomly chosen parameters\ninto their binary versions, it gives the network training procedure a chance to\ngently adapt to the partly quantized version of the network. It eventually\nachieves the full binarization by incrementally increasing the amount of\nbinarization over the iterations. Our experiments show that the proposed BGRU\nmethod produces source separation results greater than that of a real-valued\nfully connected network, with 11-12 dB mean Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR).

At present,\nexisting algorithms are able to compute the Riemannian barycentre of a\nprobability distribution, only if i.i.d. samples of this distribution are\nreadily available. However, there are many cases where i.i.d. samples are quite\ndifficult to obtain, and have to be replaced with non-independent samples,\ngenerated by a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. To overcome this difficulty,\nthe present paper proposes a new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for\ncomputing the Riemannian barycentre of a probability distribution on a Hadamard\nmanifold (a simply connected, complete Riemannian manifold with non-positive\ncurvature). This algorithm relies on two original propositions, proved in the\npaper. The first proposition states that the recursive barycentre of samples\ngenerated from a geometrically ergodic Markov chain converges in the\nmean-square to the Riemannian barycentre of the stationary distribution of this\nchain. The second proposition provides verifiable conditions which ensure a\nMetropolis-Hastings Markov chain, with its values in a symmetric Hadamard\nmanifold, is geometrically ergodic. This latter result yields a partial\nsolution, in the context of Riemannian manifolds, to the problem of geometric\nergodicity of Metropolis-Hastings chains, which has previously attracted\nextensive attention when considered in Euclidean space. In addition to these\ntwo propositions, the new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, proposed in this\npaper, is applied to a problem of Bayesian inference, arising from computer\nvision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 17:36:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 08:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

Particular care is used here in the experimental design to overcome\nthe difficulties inherent in bead pack studies. This includes the design of the\nbead pack support, the use of low frequency conditioning, and the use of\nultrasonic waves as a probe with coda wave interferometry to assess changes.\nSlow dynamics is observed in our system after three different methods for\nlow-frequency conditioning, one of which has not been reported in the\nliterature previously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 17:58:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 19:55:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 2019 19:24:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 21:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

Mathematically, this corresponds to\nfinding a mapping $X\\to Z\\equiv f(X)$ that maximizes the mutual information\n$I(Z,Y)$ while the entropy $H(Z)$ is kept below some fixed threshold.

We hypothesize that stress produces modulations\nthat can hide the true underlying emotions of individuals and that we can make\nemotion recognition algorithms more generalizable by controlling for variations\nin stress. To this end, we use adversarial networks to decorrelate stress\nmodulations from emotion representations. We study how stress alters acoustic\nand lexical emotional predictions, paying special attention to how modulations\ndue to stress affect the transferability of learned emotion recognition models\nacross domains. Our results show that stress is indeed encoded in trained\nemotion classifiers and that this encoding varies across levels of emotions and\nacross the lexical and acoustic modalities. Our results also show that emotion\nrecognition models that control for stress during training have better\ngeneralizability when applied to new domains, compared to models that do not\ncontrol for stress during training. We conclude that is is necessary to\nconsider the effect of extraneous psychological factors when building and\ntesting emotion recognition models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 19:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

A wide range of scoring\nrules have been defined over time and there is some debate as to which are the\nmost appropriate for evaluating the performance of forecasts of sporting\nevents. This paper focuses on forecasts of the outcomes of football matches.\nThe ranked probability score (RPS) is often recommended since it is `sensitive\nto distance', that is it takes into account the ordering in the outcomes (a\nhome win is `closer' to a draw than it is to an away win, for example). In this\npaper, this reasoning is disputed on the basis that it adds nothing in terms of\nthe actual aims of using scoring rules. A related property of scoring rules is\nlocality. A scoring rule is local if it only takes the probability placed on\nthe outcome into consideration. Two simulation experiments are carried out in\nthe context of football matches to compare the performance of the RPS, which is\nnon-local and sensitive to distance, the Brier score, which is non-local and\ninsensitive to distance, and the ignorance score, which is local and\ninsensitive to distance. The ignorance score is found to outperform both the\nRPS and the Brier score, casting doubt on the value of non-locality and\nsensitivity to distance as properties of scoring rules in this context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 19:04:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

However, there still\nremain challenges for multi-target tracking due to object number fluctuation\nand occlusion. To overcome these challenges, we propose a constrained mixture\nsequential Monte Carlo (CMSMC) method in which a mixture representation is\nincorporated in the estimated posterior distribution to maintain\nmulti-modality. Multiple targets can be tracked simultaneously within a unified\nframework without explicit data association between observations and tracking\ntargets. The framework can incorporate an arbitrary prediction model as the\nimplicit proposal distribution of the CMSMC method. An example in this paper is\na learning-based model for hierarchical time-series prediction, which consists\nof a behavior recognition module and a state evolution module. Both modules in\nthe proposed model are generic and flexible so as to be applied to a class of\ntime-series prediction problems where behaviors can be separated into different\nlevels. Finally, the proposed framework is applied to a numerical case study as\nwell as a task of on-road vehicle tracking, behavior recognition, and\nprediction in highway scenarios. Instead of only focusing on forecasting\ntrajectory of a single entity, we jointly predict continuous motions for\ninteractive entities simultaneously.

This study is aimed to identify subphenotypes of\npediatric sepsis and demonstrate the potential value of partitioned\ndata/subtyping-based training. Methods: This was a retrospective study of\nclinical data extracted from medical records of 6,446 pediatric patients that\nwere admitted at a major hospital system in the DC area. Vitals and labs\nassociated with patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for sepsis were used\nto perform latent profile analysis. Modern ML algorithms were used to explore\nthe predictive performance benefits of reduced training data heterogeneity via\nlabel profiling. Results: In total 134 (2.1%) patients met the diagnostic\ncriteria for sepsis in this cohort and latent profile analysis identified four\nprofiles/subphenotypes of pediatric sepsis. Profiles 1 and 3 had the lowest\nmortality and included pediatric patients from different age groups.

We\nadapt and extend a method, previously devised to describe the effect of gaseous\nfluctuations on cold dark matter cusps, in order to determine the imprints of\nultra-light axion haloes on the motion of classical test particles. We first\nevaluate the effect of fluctuations in a statistically homogeneous medium of\nclassical particles, then in a similar system of ultra light axions. In the\nfirst case, one recovers the classical two body relaxation time (and diffusion\ncoefficients) from white noise density fluctuations. In the second situation,\nthe fluctuations are not born of discreteness noise but from the finite de\nBroglie wavelength; correlation therefore exists over this scale, while white\nnoise is retained on larger scales, elucidating the correspondence with\nclassical relaxation. The resulting density power spectra and correlation\nfunctions are compared with those inferred from numerical simulations, and the\nrelaxation time arising from the associated potential fluctuations is\nevaluated. We then apply our results to estimate the heating of disks embedded\nin axion dark haloes. We find that this implies an axion mass $m \\ga 2 \\times\n10^{-22} {\\rm eV}$.

In this paper, we introduce the DAST model, which stands for\nDeciding About Semantic Complexity of a Text. DAST proposes an intuitionistic\napproach to semantics that lets us have a well-defined model for the semantics\nof a text and its complexity: semantic is considered as a lattice of intuitions\nand, as a result, semantic complexity is defined as the result of a calculation\non this lattice. A set theoretic formal definition of semantic complexity, as a\n6-tuple formal system, is provided. By using this formal system, a method for\nmeasuring semantic complexity is presented. The evaluation of the proposed\napproach is done by a set of three human-judgment experiments. The results show\nthat DAST model is capable of deciding about semantic complexity of text.\nFurthermore, the analysis of the results leads us to introduce a Markovian\nmodel for the process of common-sense, multiple-steps and semantic-complexity\nreasoning in people.

Visual understanding aims to extract\neffective visual features. Visual matching aims to model a human notion of\ncompatibility to compute a match between fashion items. Most previous studies\nrely on recommendation loss alone to guide visual understanding and matching.\nAlthough the features captured by these methods describe basic characteristics\n(e.g., color, texture, shape) of the input items, they are not directly related\nto the visual signals of the output items (to be recommended). This is\nproblematic because the aesthetic characteristics (e.g., style, design), based\non which we can directly infer the output items, are lacking. Features are\nlearned under the recommendation loss alone, where the supervision signal is\nsimply whether the given two items are matched or not. To address this problem,\nwe propose a neural co-supervision learning framework, called the FAshion\nRecommendation Machine (FARM). FARM improves visual understanding by\nincorporating the supervision of generation loss, which we hypothesize to be\nable to better encode aesthetic information. FARM enhances visual matching by\nintroducing a novel layer-to-layer matching mechanism to fuse aesthetic\ninformation more effectively, and meanwhile avoiding paying too much attention\nto the generation quality and ignoring the recommendation performance.\nExtensive experiments on two publicly available datasets show that FARM\noutperforms state-of-the-art models on outfit recommendation, in terms of AUC\nand MRR.

This\nasymmetry is the basis for a large number of selection oriented methods that\nuse a generator system to guess a set of solutions and an evaluator system to\nrank and select the best solutions. This work examines the use of this approach\nto the problem of panoptic image segmentation and class agnostic parts\nsegmentation. The generator/evaluator approach for this case consists of two\nindependent convolutional neural nets: a generator net that suggests variety\nsegments corresponding to objects, stuff and parts regions in the image, and an\nevaluator net that chooses the best segments to be merged into the segmentation\nmap. The result is a trial and error evolutionary approach in which a generator\nthat guesses segments with low average accuracy, but with wide variability, can\nstill produce good results when coupled with an accurate evaluator. The\ngenerator consists of a Pointer net that receives an image and a point in the\nimage, and predicts the region of the segment containing the point. Generating\nand evaluating each segment separately is essential in this case since it\ndemands exponentially fewer guesses compared to a system that guesses and\nevaluates the full segmentation map in each try. The classification of the\nselected segments is done by an independent region-specific classification net.\nThis allows the segmentation to be class agnostic and hence, capable of\nsegmenting unfamiliar categories that were not part of the training set. The\nmethod was examined on the COCO Panoptic segmentation benchmark and gave\nresults comparable to those of the basic semantic segmentation and Mask-RCNN\nmethods. In addition, the system was used for the task of splitting objects of\nunseen classes (that did not appear in the training set) into parts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2019 09:01:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 02:02:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 19:28:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 08:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

Why do they work? At which point in the proof is \"the real work\"\ndone?\n  Hoping to build a programming intuition of these proofs, we implement a\nnormalization argument for the simply-typed lambda-calculus with sums: instead\nof a proof, it is described as a program in a dependently-typed meta-language.\n  The semantic technique we set out to study is Krivine's classical\nrealizability, which amounts to a proof-relevant presentation of reducibility\narguments -- unary logical relations. Reducibility assigns a predicate to each\ntype, realizability assigns a set of realizers, which are abstract machines\nthat extend lambda-terms with a first-class notion of contexts.

Due to its high-accuracy performance,\ndeep face verification models of which the inference stage occurs on cloud\nplatform through internet plays the key role on most prectical scenes. However,\ntwo critical issues exist: First, individual privacy may not be well protected\nsince they have to upload their personal photo and other private information to\nthe online cloud backend. Secondly, either training or inference stage is\ntime-comsuming and the latency may affect customer experience, especially when\nthe internet link speed is not so stable or in remote areas where mobile\nreception is not so good, but also in cities where building and other\nconstruction may block mobile signals. Therefore, designing lightweight\nnetworks with low memory requirement and computational cost is one of the most\npractical solutions for face verification on mobile platform. In this paper, a\nnovel mobile network named SeesawFaceNets, a simple but effective model, is\nproposed for productively deploying face recognition for mobile devices.

All prokaryotes have genomes consisting of\ndouble-stranded DNA, where the A's and G's (purines) of one strand bind\nrespectively to the T's and C's (pyrimidines) of the other. As such, the number\nof A's on one strand nearly equals the number of T's on the other, and the same\nis true of one strand's G's and the other's C's. Globally, this relationship is\nformalized as Chargaff's first parity rule; its strandwise equivalent is\nChargaff's second parity rule. Therefore, the GC content of any double-stranded\nDNA genome can be expressed as %GC=100%-%AT. Variation in prokaryotic GC\ncontent can be substantial between taxa but is generally small within microbial\ngenomes. This variation has been found to correlate with both phylogeny and\nenvironmental factors. Since novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)\nwithin genomes are at least partially linked to the environment, SNP GC content\ncan be considered a compound measure of an organism's environmental influences,\nlifestyle and phylogeny. We present a mathematical model that describes how SNP\nGC content in microbial genomes evolves over time as a function of the AT->GC\nand GC->AT mutation rates with Gaussian white noise disturbances. The model\nsuggests that, in non-recombining bacteria, mutations can first accumulate\nunnoticeably and then abruptly fluctuate out of control. Thus, minuscule\nvariations in mutation rates can suddenly become unsustainable, ultimately\ndriving a species to extinction if not counteracted early enough. This model,\nwhich is suited specifically to symbiotic prokaryotes, conforms to scenarios\npredicted by Muller's ratchet and may suggest that this is not always a\ngradual, degrading process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2019 14:51:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

By utilizing radio dynamic spectroscopic imaging of decimetric\nstochastic spike bursts in an eruptive flare, Chen et al. found that the bursts\nform a dynamic surface-like feature located at the ending points of fast plasma\ndownflows above the looptop, interpreted as a flare termination shock. One\npiece of observational evidence that strongly supports the termination shock\ninterpretation is the occasional split of the emission band into two finer\nlanes in frequency, similar to the split-band feature seen in\nfast-coronal-shock-driven type II radio bursts. Here we perform spatially,\nspectrally, and temporally resolved analysis of the split-band feature of the\nflare termination shock event. We find that the ensemble of the radio centroids\nfrom the two split-band lanes each outlines a nearly co-spatial surface. The\nhigh-frequency lane is located slightly below its low frequency counterpart by\n~0.8 Mm, which strongly supports the shock upstream-downstream interpretation.\nUnder this scenario, the density compression ratio across the shock front can\nbe inferred from the frequency split, which implies a shock with a Mach number\nof up to 2.0. Further, the spatiotemporal evolution of the density compression\nalong the shock front agrees favorably with results from magnetohydrodynamics\nsimulations. We conclude that the detailed variations of the shock compression\nratio may be due to the impact of dynamic plasma structures in the reconnection\noutflows, which results in distortion of the shock front.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2019 15:04:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 23:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

Entropy and group\ntheory are connected here by their common relation to sets of permutations. A\ncombinatorial measure of information and disorder is proposed, in terms of\nintegers and discrete functions, that we call the integer entropy. The Shannon\nmeasure of information is the limiting case of a richer, more general\nconceptual structure that reveals relations among finite groups, information,\nand symmetries. It is shown that the integer entropy converges uniformly to the\nShannon entropy when the group includes all permutations, the Symmetric group,\nand the number of objects increases without bound. The harmonic numbers have a\nwell-known combinatorial meaning as the expected number of disjoint, non-empty\ncycles in permutations of n objects, and since integer entropy is defined in\nterms of the expected value of the number of cycles over the set of\npermutations, it also has a clear combinatorial meaning. Since all finite\ngroups are isomorphic to subgroups of the Symmetric group, every finite group\nhas a corresponding information functional, analogous to the Shannon entropy\nand a number series analogous to the harmonic numbers. The Cameron-Semeraro\ncycle polynomial is used to analyze the integer entropy for finite groups, and\nto characterize the series analogous to the Harmonic numbers. We introduce and\nuse a reciprocal polynomial, the transposition polynomial that provides an\nadditional tool and new insights. Broken symmetries and conserved quantities\nare linked through the cycle and transposition properties of the groups, and\ncan be used to generalize the analysis of stochastic processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 17:05:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 23:14:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-25"}

Nonetheless, the predictive accuracy largely depends on\nprecisely specified boundary conditions and model parameters, which, however,\nare usually uncertain in most patient-specific cases. Quantifying the\nuncertainties in model predictions due to input randomness can provide\npredictive confidence and is critical to promote the transition of CFD modeling\nin clinical applications. In the meantime, forward propagation of input\nuncertainties often involves numerous expensive CFD simulations, which is\ncomputationally prohibitive in most practical scenarios. This paper presents an\nefficient bi-fidelity surrogate modeling framework for uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) in cardiovascular simulations, by leveraging the accuracy\nof high-fidelity models and efficiency of low-fidelity models. Contrary to most\ndata-fit surrogate models with several scalar quantities of interest, this work\naims to provide high-resolution, full-field predictions. Moreover, a novel\nempirical error bound estimation approach is introduced to evaluate the\nperformance of the surrogate a priori. The proposed framework is tested on a\nnumber of vascular flows with both standardized and patient-specific vessel\ngeometries, and different combinations of high- and low-fidelity models are\ninvestigated. The results show that the bi-fidelity approach can achieve high\npredictive accuracy with a significant reduction of computational cost,\nexhibiting its merit and effectiveness. Particularly, the uncertainties from a\nhigh-dimensional input space can be accurately propagated to clinically\nrelevant quantities of interest in the patient-specific case using only a\nlimited number of high-fidelity simulations, suggesting a good potential in\npractical clinical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 16:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

The\nstate-of-the-art fiducial marker detection algorithms rely on the consistency\nof the ambient lighting. This paper introduces LiDARTag, a novel fiducial tag\ndesign and detection algorithm suitable for light detection and ranging (LiDAR)\npoint clouds. The proposed method runs in real-time and can process data at 100\nHz, which is faster than the currently available LiDAR sensor frequencies.\nBecause of the LiDAR sensors' nature, rapidly changing ambient lighting will\nnot affect the detection of a LiDARTag; hence, the proposed fiducial marker can\noperate in a completely dark environment. In addition, the LiDARTag nicely\ncomplements and is compatible with existing visual fiducial markers, such as\nAprilTags, allowing for efficient multi-sensor fusion and calibration tasks. We\nfurther propose a concept of minimizing a fitting error between a point cloud\nand the marker's template to estimate the marker's pose. The proposed method\nachieves millimeter error in translation and a few degrees in rotation. Due to\nLiDAR returns' sparsity, the point cloud is lifted to a continuous function in\na reproducing kernel Hilbert space where the inner product can be used to\ndetermine a marker's ID.

We observe that a mobile SoC provides up to 2x\nimprovement with parallel inference when all its components are engaged, as\nopposed to engaging only one component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2019 07:13:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 16:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Person-generated data sources, such as actively contributed surveys as\nwell as passively mined data from social media offer opportunity to capture\nsuch context, however the self-reported nature and sparsity of such data mean\nthat such data are noisier and less specific than physiological measures such\nas blood glucose values themselves. Therefore, here we propose a Gaussian\nProcess model to both address these data challenges and combine blood glucose\nand latent feature representations of contextual data for a novel multi-signal\nblood glucose prediction task. We find this approach outperforms common methods\nfor multi-variate data, as well as using the blood glucose values in isolation.\nGiven a robust evaluation across two blood glucose datasets with different\nforms of contextual information, we conclude that multi-signal Gaussian\nProcesses can improve blood glucose prediction by using contextual information\nand may provide a significant shift in blood glucose prediction research and\npractice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2019 11:02:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-05"}
