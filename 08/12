Supersonic disordered flows accompany the formation and evolution of\nMCs. It has been argued that turbulence can support against gravitational\ncollapse and form hierarchical sub-structures. Aims. We study the time\nevolution of simulated MCs to investigate: What physical process dominates the\ndriving of turbulent flows? How can these flows be characterised? Do the\nsimulated flows agree with observations? Methods. We analyse three MCs that\nhave formed self-consistently within kpc-scale numerical simulations of the\nISM. The simulated ISM evolves under the influence of physical processes\nincluding self-gravity, stratification, magnetic fields, supernova-driven\nturbulence, and radiative heating and cooling. We characterise the flows using\nVSFs with/out density weighting or a density cutoff, and computed in one or\nthree dimensions. Results. In regions with sufficient resolution, the\ndensity-weighted VSFs initially appear to follow the expectations for uniform\nturbulence consistent with Larson's size-velocity relationship. SN blast wave\nimpacts produce short-lived coherent motions at large scales, increasing the\nscaling exponents for a crossing time. Gravitational contraction drives\nsmall-scale motions, producing scaling coefficients that drop or even turn\nnegative as small scales become dominant. Conclusions. We conclude that two\ndifferent effects coincidentally reproduce Larson's size velocity relationship.\nInitially, uniform turbulence dominates, so the energy cascade produces VSFs\nconsistent with Larson's relationship. Later, contraction dominates, the\ndensity-weighted VSFs become much shallower or even inverted, but the\nrelationship of the global average velocity dispersion of the MCs to their\nradius follows Larson's relationship, reflecting virial equilibrium or\nfree-fall collapse. The injection of energy by shocks is visible in the VSFs,\nbut decays within a crossing time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 2019 19:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

Supposing you are a zoologist, for a presented animal\nimage, you can recognize it immediately if you know its class. Otherwise, you\nwould more likely attempt to cognize it by exploiting the side-information\n(e.g., semantic information, etc.) you have accumulated. Inspired by this, this\npaper decomposes the generalized zero-shot learning (G-ZSL) task into an open\nset recognition (OSR) task and a zero-shot learning (ZSL) task, where OSR\nrecognizes seen classes (if we have seen (or known) them) and rejects unseen\nclasses (if we have never seen (or known) them before), while ZSL identifies\nthe unseen classes rejected by the former. Simultaneously, without violating\nOSR's assumptions (only known class knowledge is available in training), we\nalso first attempt to explore a new generalized open set recognition (G-OSR) by\nintroducing the accumulated side-information from known classes to OSR. For\nG-ZSL, such a decomposition effectively solves the class overfitting problem\nwith easily misclassifying unseen classes as seen classes. The problem is\nubiquitous in most existing G-ZSL methods. On the other hand, for G-OSR,\nintroducing such semantic information of known classes not only improves the\nrecognition performance but also endows OSR with the cognitive ability of\nunknown classes. Specifically, a visual and semantic prototypes-jointly guided\nconvolutional neural network (VSG-CNN) is proposed to fulfill these two tasks\n(G-ZSL and G-OSR) in a unified end-to-end learning framework.

Given that\nthe majority of astrophysical systems are not governed by isothermal dynamics,\nwe aim to quantify the impact of thermodynamics on the physics of turbulence,\nthrough varying adiabatic index, $\\gamma$, combined with a range of optically\nthin cooling functions. In this paper, we present a suite of ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamics simulations of thermally balanced stationary turbulence in\nthe subsonic, super-Alfv\\'enic, high beta (ratio of thermal to magnetic\npressure) regime, where turbulent dissipation is balanced by two idealized\ncooling functions (approximating linear cooling and free-free emission) and\nexamine the impact of the equation of state by considering cases that\ncorrespond to isothermal, monatomic and diatomic gases.

Similarly,\nwith the linear relation between variations in density and thermal pressure\nwith sonic Mach number becomes steeper with increasing $\\gamma$. This suggests\nthat there exists a degeneracy in these relations with respect to\nthermodynamics and Mach number in this regime, which is dominated by slow\nmagnetosonic modes. These results have implications for attempts to infer\n(e.g.) Mach numbers from (e.g.) Faraday rotation measurements, without\nadditional information regarding the thermodynamics of the plasma.

Although 3D plant point clouds contain\nabundant phenotypic features, plant leaves are usually distributed in clusters\nand are sometimes seriously overlapped in the canopy. Therefore, it is still a\nbig challenge to automatically segment each individual leaf from a highly\ncrowded plant canopy in 3D for plant phenotyping purposes. In this work, we\npropose an overlapping-free individual leaf segmentation method for plant point\nclouds using the 3D filtering and facet region growing. In order to separate\nleaves with different overlapping situations, we develop a new 3D joint\nfiltering operator, which integrates a Radius-based Outlier Filter (RBOF) and a\nSurface Boundary Filter (SBF) to help to separate occluded leaves. By\nintroducing the facet over-segmentation and facet-based region growing, the\nnoise in segmentation is suppressed and labeled leaf centers can expand to\ntheir whole leaves, respectively. Our method can work on point clouds generated\nfrom three types of 3D imaging platforms, and also suitable for different kinds\nof plant species. In experiments, it obtains a point-level cover rate of 97%\nfor Epipremnum aureum, 99% for Monstera deliciosa, 99% for Calathea makoyana,\nand 87% for Hedera nepalensis sample plants. At the leaf level, our method\nreaches an average Recall at 100.00%, a Precision at 99.33%, and an average\nF-measure at 99.66%, respectively. The proposed method can also facilitate the\nautomatic traits estimation of each single leaf (such as the leaf area, length,\nand width), which has potential to become a highly effective tool for plant\nresearch and agricultural engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 06:18:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

In this paper, we define a distinctively new\ntask, namely sentence specified dynamic video thumbnail generation, where the\ngenerated thumbnails not only provide a concise preview of the original video\ncontents but also dynamically relate to the users' searching intentions with\nsemantic correspondences to the users' query sentences. To tackle such a\nchallenging task, we propose a novel graph convolved video thumbnail pointer\n(GTP). Specifically, GTP leverages a sentence specified video graph\nconvolutional network to model both the sentence-video semantic interaction and\nthe internal video relationships incorporated with the sentence information,\nbased on which a temporal conditioned pointer network is then introduced to\nsequentially generate the sentence specified video thumbnails. Moreover, we\nannotate a new dataset based on ActivityNet Captions for the proposed new task,\nwhich consists of 10,000+ video-sentence pairs with each accompanied by an\nannotated sentence specified video thumbnail. We demonstrate that our proposed\nGTP outperforms several baseline methods on the created dataset, and thus\nbelieve that our initial results along with the release of the new dataset will\ninspire further research on sentence specified dynamic video thumbnail\ngeneration. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/yytzsy/GTP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 08:35:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 09:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-17"}

Reconditioning methods are used to improve the\nconditioning of covariance matrices while retaining correlation information. In\nthis paper we study the impact of using the 'ridge regression' method of\nreconditioning to assimilate Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer\n(IASI) observations in the Met Office 1D-Var system. This is the first\nsystematic investigation of how changing target condition numbers affects\nconvergence of a 1D-Var routine.

This suggests that using a correlated OEC matrix in the 1D-Var routine\nwould have computational benefits for IASI observations. Using reconditioned\ncorrelated OEC matrices also increases the number of observations that pass\nquality control. However, the impact on skin temperature, cloud fraction and\ncloud top pressure is less clear. As the reconditioning parameter is increased,\ndifferences between retrieved variables for correlated OEC matrices and the\noperational diagonal OEC matrix reduce. As correlated choices of OEC matrix\nyield faster convergence, using stricter convergence criteria along with these\nmatrices may increase efficiency and improve quality control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 09:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

In modern cosmology, the generalised\nsecond law of thermodynamics (GSLT) plays an important role in deciding\nthermodynamical compliance of a model as one cannot consider a model to be\nviable if it fails to respect GSLT. Hence, for comparing thermodynamical\nviability, we examine the validity of GSLT for these two models. For this\npurpose, by employing the Unified first law (UFL), we calculate the total\nentropy of these two models in apparent and event horizons. The validity of\nGSLT is then examined from the autonomous systems as the original expressions\nof total entropy are very complicated. Although, at the background level, both\nmodels give interesting cosmological dynamics, however, thermodynamically we\nfound that the square kinetic correction is more realistic as compared to the\nsquare root kinetic correction. More precisely, the GSLT holds for the square\nkinetic correction throughout the evolutionary history except only during the\nradiation epoch where the scalar field may not represent a true description of\nthe matter content. On the other hand, the square root kinetic model fails to\nsatisfy the GSLT in major cosmological eras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 11:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

To compare the performance of DLEPT\nnetworks on different datasets, three datasets were used throughout this work,\none from simulations and two from in-vivo measurements from healthy volunteers\nand cancer patients, respectively. At first, networks trained on simulations\nare tested on all datasets with different levels of homogeneous Gaussian noise\nintroduced in training and testing.

Deep learning (DL) based methods have shown potential in this realm and\nare the current state-of-the-art, however, their robustness to heterogeneity of\nMRI acquisition settings remains an open problem. In this study, we\ninvestigated two modern regularization techniques -- mixup and adversarial\nunsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) -- to improve the robustness of DL-based\nknee cartilage segmentation to new MRI acquisition settings. Our validation\nsetup included two datasets produced by different MRI scanners and using\ndistinct data acquisition protocols.

Combining localization into\ncommunications and designing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)\nalgorithms are challenging problems. This study considers the joint position\nand velocity estimation and environment mapping problem in a three-dimensional\nmmWave CRAN architecture. We first embed cooperative localization into\ncommunications and establish the joint estimation and mapping model with hybrid\ndelay and angle measurements. Then, we propose a closed-form weighted least\nsquare (WLS) solution for the joint estimation and mapping problems. The\nproposed WLS estimator is proven asymptotically unbiased and confirmed by\nsimulations as effective in achieving the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and the\ndesired decimeter-level accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a WLS-Net-based SLAM\nalgorithm by embedding neural networks into the proposed WLS estimators to\nreplace the linear approximations. The solution possesses both powerful\nlearning ability of the neural network and robustness of the proposed geometric\nmodel, and the ensemble learning is applied to further improve positioning\naccuracy. A public ray-tracing dataset is used in the simulations to test the\nperformance of the WLS-Net-based SLAM algorithm, which is proven fast and\neffective in attaining the centimeter-level accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 13:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

The KL effect\nacts on a disc that is highly inclined to the binary orbital plane provided\nthat the disc aspect ratio is sufficiently small. The eccentric disc overflows\nits Roche lobe and material flows from the Be star disc over to the companion\nneutron star causing X-ray activity. With N-body simulations and steady state\ndecretion disc models we explore system parameters for which a disc in the\nBe/X-ray binary 4U 0115+634 is KL unstable and the resulting timescale for the\noscillations. We find good agreement between predictions of the model and the\nobserved giant outburst timescale provided that the disc is not completely\ndestroyed by the outburst. This allows the outer disc to be replenished between\noutbursts and a sufficiently short KL oscillation timescale. An initially\neccentric disc has a shorter KL oscillation timescale compared to an initially\ncircular orbit disc. We suggest that the chaotic nature of the outbursts is\ncaused by the sensitivity of the mechanism to the distribution of material\nwithin the disc. The outbursts continue provided that the Be star supplies\nmaterial that is sufficiently misaligned to the binary orbital plane. We\ngeneralise our results to Be/X-ray binaries with varying orbital period and\nfind that if the Be star disc is flared, it is more likely to be unstable to KL\noscillations in a smaller orbital period binary, in agreement with\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 13:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

We ran numerous N-body\nsimulations, coupled to a thermally evolving viscous disc model, including\nprescriptions for planet migration and photoevaporation. We examine the\ndifferences between the pebble and planetesimal accretion scenarios, but also\nlook at the influences of disc mass, planetesimal size, and the percentage of\nsolids locked up within pebbles. When comparing the resulting planetary systems\nto Trappist-1, we find that a wide range of initial conditions for both\naccretion scenarios can form planetary systems similar to Trappist-1, in terms\nof planet mass, periods, and resonant configurations. Typically these planets\nformed exterior to the water iceline and migrated in resonant convoys to close\nto the central star. When comparing the planetary systems formed from pebbles\nto those formed from planetesimals, we find a large number of similarities,\nincluding average planet masses, eccentricities, inclinations and period\nratios. One major difference was that of the water content of the planets. When\nincluding the effects of ablation and full recycling of the planets envelope\nwith the disc, planets formed from pebbles were extremely dry, whilst those\nformed from planetesimals were extremely wet. If the water content is not fully\nrecycled and instead falls to the planets core, or if ablation of the water is\nneglected, then the planets formed from pebbles are extremely wet, similar to\nthose formed from planetesimals. Should the water content of the Trappist-1\nplanets be determined accurately, this could point to a preferred formation\npathway for planetary systems, or to specific physics that may be at play.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 14:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

Existing TMOs can successfully tone-map only a\nlimited number of HDR content and require an extensive parameter tuning to\nyield the best subjective-quality tone-mapped output. In this paper, we address\nthis problem by proposing a fast, parameter-free and scene-adaptable deep tone\nmapping operator (DeepTMO) that yields a high-resolution and high-subjective\nquality tone mapped output. Based on conditional generative adversarial network\n(cGAN), DeepTMO not only learns to adapt to vast scenic-content (e.g., outdoor,\nindoor, human, structures, etc.) but also tackles the HDR related\nscene-specific challenges such as contrast and brightness, while preserving the\nfine-grained details. We explore 4 possible combinations of\nGenerator-Discriminator architectural designs to specifically address some\nprominent issues in HDR related deep-learning frameworks like blurring, tiling\npatterns and saturation artifacts. By exploring different influences of scales,\nloss-functions and normalization layers under a cGAN setting, we conclude with\nadopting a multi-scale model for our task. To further leverage on the\nlarge-scale availability of unlabeled HDR data, we train our network by\ngenerating targets using an objective HDR quality metric, namely Tone Mapping\nImage Quality Index (TMQI). We demonstrate results both quantitatively and\nqualitatively, and showcase that our DeepTMO generates high-resolution,\nhigh-quality output images over a large spectrum of real-world scenes. Finally,\nwe evaluate the perceived quality of our results by conducting a pair-wise\nsubjective study which confirms the versatility of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 15:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

The aim of this work is to present a new friction formulation that can\nmodel the tangential contact behavior between osseointegrated implants and bone\ntissue, with focus on debonding. The classical Coulomb's law is combined with a\nstate variable friction law to model a displacement-dependent friction\ncoefficient. A smooth state function, based on the sliding distance, is used to\nmodel implant debonding.

We highlight three primary needs in\nthe design of new smart health technologies: 1) the need for sensing technology\nthat can track longitudinal trends in signs and symptoms of the cardiovascular\ndisorder despite potentially infrequent, noisy, or missing data measurements;\n2) the need for new analytic techniques that model data captured in a\nlongitudinal, continual fashion to aid in the development of new risk\nprediction techniques and in tracking disease progression; and 3) the need for\nmachine learning techniques that are personalized and interpretable, allowing\nfor advancements in shared clinical decision making. We highlight these needs\nbased upon the current state-of-the-art in smart health technologies and\nanalytics and discuss the ample opportunities that exist in addressing all\nthree needs in the development of smart health technologies and analytics\napplied to the field of cardiovascular disorders and care.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 03:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

Therefore, sleep monitoring has drawn significant\nattention from both research and industry communities. In this article, we\nfirst review the sleep monitoring issue and point out three essential\nproperties of an ideal sleep healthcare system, i.e., realtime guarding,\nfine-grained logging, and cost-effectiveness. Based on the analysis, we present\nSleepGuardian, a Radio Frequence (RF) based sleep healthcare system leveraging\nsignal processing, edge computing and machine learning.SleepGuardian offers an\noffline sleep logging service and an online abnormality warning service. The\noffline service provides a fine-grained sleep log like timing and regularity of\nbed time, onset of sleep and night time awakenings. The online service keeps\nguarding the subject for any abnormal behaviors during sleep like intensive\nbody twitches and a sudden seizure attack. Once an abnormality happens,it will\nautomatically warn the designated contacts like a nearby emergency room or a\ncloseby relative.We prototype SleepGuardian with low-cost WiFi devices and\nevaluate it in real scenarios.
