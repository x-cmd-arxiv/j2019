To date, none of the proposed scenarios is able\nto explain quantitatively all chemical patterns observed in individual\nclusters, and an extension of the study of multiple populations to resolved\nextragalactic massive clusters beyond the Magellanic Clouds would be welcome,\nfor it would enable to investigate and characterize the presence of multiple\npopulations in different environments and age ranges. To this purpose, the\nJames Webb Space Telescope can potentially play a major role. On the one hand,\nthe JWST promises direct observations of proto-globular cluster candidates at\nhigh redshift; on the other hand, it can potentially push to larger distances\nthe sample of resolved clusters with detected multiple populations. In this\npaper we have addressed this second goal. Using theoretical stellar spectra and\nstellar evolution models, we have investigated the effect of multiple\npopulation chemical patterns on synthetic magnitudes in the JWST infrared\nNIRCam filters. We have identified the colours (F150W-F460M), (F115W-F460M) and\npseudocolours C_{F150W,F460M,F115W}=(F150W-F460M)-(F460M-F115W),\nC_{F150W,F277W,F115W}=(F150W-F277W)-(F277W-F115W), as diagnostics able to\nreveal the presence of multiple populations along the red giant branches of old\nand intermediate age clusters. Using the available on-line simulator for the\nNIRCam detector, we have estimated that multiple populations can be potentially\ndetected --depending on the exposure times, exact filter combination used, plus\nthe extent of the abundance variations and the cluster [Fe/H]--out to a\ndistance of about 5Mpc (approximately the distance to the M83 group).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 16:05:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

Several approaches to enlarge search\nregions have been already proposed in the past years to make up for this\nshortcoming. However, with excessive background information, more background\nnoises are also introduced and the discriminative filter is prone to learn from\nthe ambiance rather than the object. This situation, along with appearance\nchanges of objects caused by full/partial occlusion, illumination variation,\nand other reasons has made it more likely to have aberrances in the detection\nprocess, which could substantially degrade the credibility of its result.\nTherefore, in this work, a novel approach to repress the aberrances happening\nduring the detection process is proposed, i.e., aberrance repressed correlation\nfilter (ARCF).

Adversarial examples are generated by a malicious adversary by\nobtaining access to the model parameters, such as gradient information, to\nalter the input or by attacking a substitute model and transferring those\nmalicious examples over to attack the victim model. Specifically, one of these\nattack algorithms, Robust Physical Perturbations ($RP_2$), generates\nadversarial images of stop signs with black and white stickers to achieve high\ntargeted misclassification rates against standard-architecture traffic sign\nclassifiers. In this paper, we propose BlurNet, a defense against the $RP_2$\nattack. First, we motivate the defense with a frequency analysis of the first\nlayer feature maps of the network on the LISA dataset, which shows that high\nfrequency noise is introduced into the input image by the $RP_2$ algorithm. To\nremove the high frequency noise, we introduce a depthwise convolution layer of\nstandard blur kernels after the first layer. We perform a blackbox transfer\nattack to show that low-pass filtering the feature maps is more beneficial than\nfiltering the input. We then present various regularization schemes to\nincorporate this low-pass filtering behavior into the training regime of the\nnetwork and perform white-box attacks.

(iv) The ability of PPMAP to distinguish different types of\ndust, i.e. dust characterised by different values of the emissivity index,\n$\\beta$, reveals that the dust in the filament has a lower emissivity index,\n$\\beta\\leq1.5$, than the dust outside the filament, $\\beta\\geq 1.7$, implying\nthat the physical conditions in the filament have effected a change in the\nproperties of the dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

This procedure is a priori coordinate-dependent,\nand may not be well-motivated in full, covariant general relativity; however,\nthe fact that physically meaningful quantities such as the entanglement entropy\ncan be obtained by such a regulation procedure suggests some underlying\ncovariance. In this paper, we provide a careful treatment of the radial cutoff\nprocedure for computing holographic entanglement entropy in asymptotically\nanti-de Sitter spacetimes. We prove two results that are frequently assumed in\nthe literature, but that have not been carefully addressed: (i) that the choice\nof a \"globally minimal surface\" among several extremal candidates is\nindependent of the choice of regulator, and (ii) that finite CFT quantities\nsuch as the mutual information which involve \"divergence-cancelling\" sums of\nholographic entanglement entropies are well-defined. Our results imply that the\n\"globally minimal surface\" prescription for computing holographic entanglement\nentropy is well-posed from the perspective of general relativity, and thus\nsupport the belief that this is the correct prescription for identifying the\nentanglement wedge of a boundary subregion in AdS/CFT. We also comment on the\ngeometric source of state-dependent divergences in the holographic entanglement\nentropy, and identify precisely the regime of validity of the \"vacuum\nsubtraction\" protocol for regulating infinite entanglement entropies in\narbitrary states by comparing them to the entanglement entropies of identical\nregions in the vacuum. Our proofs make use of novel techniques for the\ncovariant analysis of extremal surfaces, which are explained in detail and may\nfind use more broadly in the study of holographic entanglement entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 18:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 22:46:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-18"}

Colliders, and particularly hadron colliders,\nproduce both neutrinos and anti-neutrinos of all flavors at very high energies,\nand they are therefore highly complementary to those from other sources. FASER,\nthe recently approved Forward Search Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider,\nis ideally located to provide the first detection and study of collider\nneutrinos. We investigate the prospects for neutrino studies of a proposed\ncomponent of FASER, FASER$\\nu$, a 25cm x 25cm x 1.35m emulsion detector to be\nplaced directly in front of the FASER spectrometer in tunnel TI12. FASER$\\nu$\nconsists of 1000 layers of emulsion films interleaved with 1-mm-thick tungsten\nplates, with a total tungsten target mass of 1.2 tons. We estimate the neutrino\nfluxes and interaction rates at FASER$\\nu$, describe the FASER$\\nu$ detector,\nand analyze the characteristics of the signals and primary backgrounds. For an\nintegrated luminosity of 150 fb$^{-1}$ to be collected during Run 3 of the 14\nTeV Large Hadron Collider from 2021-23, and assuming standard model cross\nsections, approximately 1300 electron neutrinos, 20,000 muon neutrinos, and 20\ntau neutrinos will interact in FASER$\\nu$, with mean energies of 600 GeV to 1\nTeV, depending on the flavor. With such rates and energies, FASER will measure\nneutrino cross sections at energies where they are currently unconstrained,\nwill bound models of forward particle production, and could open a new window\non physics beyond the standard model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 18:20:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 07:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-22"}

Impulsive SEP events, defined by uniquely large\nenhancements of Fe/O, emerge from magnetic reconnection in solar jets. In\nsmall, \"pure,\" shock-free, impulsive SEP events, protons with mass-to-charge\nratio A/Q = 1 fit the power-law dependence of element abundance enhancements\nversus A/Q extrapolated from the heavier elements 2 < Z < 57. Sometimes these\nevents have order-of-magnitude suppressions of He, even though H fits with\nheavier elements, perhaps because of the slower ionization of He during a rapid\nrise of plasma from the chromosphere. In larger impulsive SEP events, He fits,\nbut there are large proton excesses relative to the power-law fit of Z > 2\nions, probably because associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) drive shock\nwaves fast enough to reaccelerate the impulsive SEPs but also to sample protons\nfrom the ambient solar plasma. In contrast, gradual SEP events are accelerated\nby wide, fast CME-driven shock waves, but those with smaller, weaker shocks,\nperhaps quasi-perpendicular, favor impulsive suprathermal residue left by many\nprevious jets, again supplemented with excess protons from ambient coronal\nplasma. In the larger, more common gradual SEP events, faster, stronger shock\nwaves sample the ambient coronal plasma more deeply, overwhelming any\nimpulsive-ion component, so that proton abundances again fit the same power-law\ndistribution as all other elements.

I\ntake advantage of this model to analyse innovative technologies (Homomorphic\nAuthenticators, Verifiable Delay Functions) which developed into their own\nspecialised domains, and I attempt to make them more accessible for newcomers\nto the field. Furthermore, I expand on the future of Verifiable Computation,\nUniversal proof compilers and \"Proofs of All\", by approaching the\nstate-of-the-art zk-STARK construction from a more accessible and informal\ndesign perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 19:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Aug 2019 12:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Notably, the\nphoton field, absorption process, transduction mechanism, and measurement\nprocess are all treated as part of one fully-coupled quantum system, with\nexplicit interactions. Using non-equilibrium, time-dependent quantum transport\nsimulations, we reveal the unique temporal signatures of the single photon\ndetection process, and show that the system can be described using optical\nBloch equations, with a new non-linearity as a consequence of time-dependent\ndetuning caused by the backaction from the transport channel via the dynamical\nStark effect. We compute the photodetector signal-to-noise ratio and\ndemonstrate that single photon detection at high count rate is possible for\nrealistic parameters by exploiting a novel non-equilibrium control of\nbackaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 19:37:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Groundwater is widely\nused to supply water for drinking, industry, and agriculture purposes. The\ngroundwater quality measurements vary for different climates and various human\nbehaviors, and consequently, their spatial variability can be substantial. In\nthis paper, we aim to analyze a groundwater dataset from the Golestan province,\nIran, for November 2003 to November 2013. Our target response variable to\nmonitor the quality of groundwater is the number of counts that the quality of\nwater is good for a drink. Hence, we are facing spatial count data. Due to the\nubiquity of over or underdispersion in count data, we propose a Bayesian\nhierarchical modeling approach based on the renewal theory that relates\nnonexponential waiting times between events and the distribution of the counts,\nrelaxing the assumption of equidispersion at the cost of an additional\nparameter. Particularly, we extend the methodology for the analysis of spatial\ncount data based on the gamma distribution assumption for waiting times. The\nmodel can be formulated as a latent Gaussian model, and therefore, we can carry\nout the fast computation by using the integrated nested Laplace approximation\nmethod. The analysis of the groundwater dataset and a simulation study show a\nsignificant improvement over both Poisson and negative binomial models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 19:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-08"}

In contrast to that, dispersions of polymer-wrapped SWNTs\nin organic solvents feature unrivaled purity, higher PLQY and are easily\nprocessed into thin films for device applications.

The construction\nalso allows a general class of open boundary conditions: as an application of\nthe duality, we find the hydrodynamic limit and stationary measures of the\ngeneralized symmetric simple exclusion process SSEP$(m/2)$ on $\\mathbb{Z}_+$\nfor open boundary conditions.\n  2. For the asymmetric simple exclusion process, the fused process and duality\nfunctions are inhomogeneous generalizations of those found in \\cite{CGRS} for\nthe ASEP$(q,j)$. As a by-product of the construction, we show that the\nmulti-species ASEP$(q,j)$ preserves $q$-exchangeable measures, and use this to\nfind new duality functions for the ASEP, ASEP$(q,j)$ and $q$-Boson.\nAdditionally, the construction leads to duality for ASEP with open boundary\nconditions. As an application of the latter duality, we find the hydrodynamic\nlimit.\n  3. For dynamic models, we fuse the dynamic ASEP from \\cite{BorodinDyn}, and\nproduce a dynamic and inhomogeneous version of ASEP$(q,j)$. We also apply\nstochastic fusion to IRF models and compare them to previously found models.\n  We include an appendix co-authored with Amol Aggarwal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 20:40:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 00:04:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 21:54:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 2019 23:55:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

Choosing how to prioritize the robots is a key\nconsideration. State-of-the-art prioritization heuristics, however, do not\nmodel the coupling between a robot's mobility and its environment.

To this end, we consider the number of homology classes\nof trajectories, and use this as a prioritization rule in our decentralized\npath planning algorithm, whenever any robots enter negotiation to deconflict\npath plans.

Four different\nmobility metrics - two versions of radius of gyration and two versions of\nentropy - are used to study the behaviour of populations during three disasters\n- the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal, and\nHurricane Matthew in Haiti in 2016. We characterise the rate at which a\ndisrupted population resettles by the fraction of individuals who remain\ndisrupted each week after the disaster. We find that this rate can be modelled\nvery well as the sum of two exponential decays and observe that the resettling\nrate for all three disasters is similar, with half the original number of\ndisplaced persons having resettled within four to five weeks of the disaster.\nIf the study of further disasters leads to the observation of similar\nexponential decay rates, then it would imply that the number of IDPs at any\ntime can be inferred from an estimate of the initial number of IDPs immediately\nfollowing the disaster. Alternatively, the method provides a way to monitor\ndisaster resilience and compare recovery rates across disasters. The method has\nthe advantage that no assumptions need to be made regarding the location or\ntime of resettlement. Our results indicate that CDRs can significantly\ncontribute to measuring and predicting displacement durations, distances, and\nlocations of IDPs in post-disaster scenarios. We believe that information and\nestimates provided by specifically developed CDR analytics, coupled with field\ndata collection and traditional survey methods, can assist the humanitarian\nresponse to natural disasters and the subsequent resettlement efforts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 22:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-08"}

To address the problem, they\nproposed a space-efficient coercion calculus, which was subsequently improved\nby Siek et al. The semantics of these calculi involves eager composition of\nrun-time checks expressed by coercions to prevent the size of a term from\ngrowing. However, it relies also on a nonstandard reduction rule, which does\nnot seem easy to implement. In fact, no compiler implementation of gradually\ntyped languages fully supports the space-efficient semantics faithfully.\n  In this paper, we study coercion-passing style, which Herman et al. have\nalready mentioned, as a technique for straightforward space-efficient\nimplementation of gradually typed languages. A program in coercion-passing\nstyle passes \"the rest of the run-time checks\" around---just like\ncontinuation-passing style (CPS), in which \"the rest of the computation\" is\npassed around---and (unlike CPS) composes coercions eagerly. We give a formal\ncoercion-passing translation from $\\lambda$S by Siek et al. to $\\lambda$S$_1$,\nwhich is a new calculus of first-class coercions tailored for coercion-passing\nstyle, and prove correctness of the translation.

Since the frame-level or segment-level\nannotations of untrimmed videos require amounts of labor expenditure, studies\non the weakly-supervised action detection have been springing up. However, most\nof existing frameworks rely on Class Activation Sequence (CAS) to localize\nactions by minimizing the video-level classification loss, which exploits the\nmost discriminative parts of actions but ignores the minor regions. In this\npaper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised framework by adversarial learning\nof two modules for eliminating such demerits. Specifically, the first module is\ndesigned as a well-designed Seeded Sequence Growing (SSG) Network for\nprogressively extending seed regions (namely the highly reliable regions\ninitialized by a CAS-based framework) to their expected boundaries. The second\nmodule is a specific classifier for mining trivial or incomplete action\nregions, which is trained on the shared features after erasing the seeded\nregions activated by SSG. In this way, a whole network composed of these two\nmodules can be trained in an adversarial manner. The goal of the adversary is\nto mine features that are difficult for the action classifier. That is, erasion\nfrom SSG will force the classifier to discover minor or even new action regions\non the input feature sequence, and the classifier will drive the seeds to grow,\nalternately. At last, we could obtain the action locations and categories from\nthe well-trained SSG and the classifier. Extensive experiments on two public\nbenchmarks THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet1.3 demonstrate the impressive performance\nof our proposed method compared with the state-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 02:33:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-08"}

The\nstate-of-the-art defense is the computationally expensive and very time\nconsuming adversarial training via projected gradient descent (PGD). We\nhypothesize that adversarial attacks exploit the open space risk of classic\nmonotonic activation functions.

Unaided-eye sunspot (UES) observations\ncan be traced back well before the start of telescopic observations of the Sun,\nespecially in the East Asian historical records. It is therefore important to\ncompare more modern, UES observations with the results of telescopic sunspot\nobservations, to gain a better understanding of the nature of the UES records.\nA previous comparison of Chinese UES records and Greenwich photo-heliographic\nresults between 1874 and 1918 indicated that a few of the UES were apparently\nnot supported by direct photographic evidence of at least one sunspot with a\nlarge area. This article reveals that one of the Chinese unaided-eye\nobservations had possibly captured the transit of Venus on 9 December 1874. The\nChinese sunspot records on this date are compared with Western sunspot\nobservations on the same day. It is concluded that sunspots on the solar disk\nwere quite small and the transit of Venus was probably misinterpreted as a\nsunspot by the Chinese local scholars. This case indicates that sunspots or\ncomparable \"obscuring\" objects with an area as large as 1000 millionths of the\nsolar disk could easily have been seen with the unaided eye under suitable\nseeing conditions. It also confirms the visibility of sunspots near the solar\nlimb with the unaided eye. This study provides an explanation of the apparent\ndiscrepancy between the Chinese UES observation on 9 December 1874 and the\nWestern sunspot observations using telescopes, as well as a basis for further\ndiscussion on the negative pairs in 1900 and 1911, apparently without\nsufficiently large area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 06:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-08"}

The most\nrecent of these events, which began in June 2018, was monitored by several\nspacecraft in orbit and on the surface, but many questions remain regarding its\nonset, expansion and decay. We model the 2018 global dust storm with the NASA\nAmes Mars Global Climate Model to better understand the evolution of the storm\nand how the general circulation and finite surface dust reservoirs impact it.\nThe global dust storm is characterized by the rapid eastward transport of dust\nin the equatorial regions and subsequent lifting. We highlight the rapid\ntransfer of dust between western and eastern hemispheres reservoirs, which may\nplay an important role in the storm development through the replenishment of\nsurface dust. Both the Hadley cell circulation and the diurnal cycle of\natmospheric heating increase in intensity with increasing dustiness. Large dust\nplumes are predicted during the mature stage of the storm, injecting dust up to\n80 km. The water ice cloud condensation level migrates to higher altitudes,\nleading to the enrichment of water vapor in the upper atmosphere. In our\nsimulations, the intensity of the Hadley cell is significantly stronger than\nthat of non-dusty conditions. This feedback is strongly sensitive to the\nradiative properties of dust, which depends on the effective size of the lifted\ndust distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 06:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

Animals can be\neither adaptive exploiters or adaptive mutualists (e.g., herbivores or\npollinators) that maximize their fitness.

One such alternative is ULDM; extremely\nlight scalar particles exhibiting wavelike properties on kiloparsec scales.\nAstrophysically realistic ULDM halos are expected to consist of inner solitonic\ncores embedded in NFW-like outer halos. The presence of the solitonic core\nsuggests that ULDM may resolve the core-cusp discrepancy associated with pure\nNFW halos without recourse to baryonic physics. However, it has been\ndemonstrated that the density of ULDM halos can exceed those of comparable NFW\nconfigurations at some radii and halo masses, apparently exacerbating the\nproblem rather than solving it. This situation arises because, although\nsolitonic cores are flat at their centres, they obey an inverse mass-radius\nscaling relationship. Meanwhile, the mass of the inner soliton increases with\nthe total halo mass, and therefore the inner core becomes more peaked at large\nhalo masses. We describe a parameterisation of the radial density profiles of\nULDM halos that allows for environmental variability of the core-halo mass\nrelation in order to investigate this issue in more detail. For halos up to\n10^12 solar masses we find feasible ULDM profiles for which the central density\nis lower than their NFW counterparts at astrophysically accessible radii.\nHowever, comparisons to observed profiles do not strongly favour either option;\nboth give reasonable fits to subsets of the data for some parameter choices.\nConsequently, we find that robust tests of the core-cusp problem in ULDM will\nrequire more comprehensive observational data and simulations that include\nbaryonic feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 10:04:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 01:36:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 23:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

The composition of a protoplanetary disk at a given location does\nnot only depend on temperature and pressure but also on the time dependent\ntransport of matter, such as radial drift of solid bodies, which could release\nwater and other volatile species before disintegration or accretion onto a\nlarger body with potentially considerable implications for the composition of\nplanets. Aims. We perform a parameter study focused on the water depletion of\ndifferent sized bodies able to cross the water snowline by gas induced radial\ndrift. Methods. Either the analytical Hertz-Knudsen-Langmuir sublimation\nformula assuming equilibrium temperature within the body or a more involved,\nnumerical model for the internal thermal evolution is coupled with an\nalpha-disk model. Different properties of the disk and the embedded body are\nexplored. Results. Bodies with radii up to 100 meter drift faster towards the\ncentral star than the water snowline, hence, cross it. The region that can be\nreached before complete disintegration - and is therefore polluted with H2O ice\n- extends to 10 percent closer to the star than the snowline location. The\nextent of this polluted region could be multiple times larger in the presence\nof a dust mantle, which is, however, unlikely to form due to frequent\ncollisions with smaller-than centimeter sized objects. Conclusions. Given a\nsignificant abundance of meter sized boulders in protoplanetary disks, the\ntransport of water by radial drift of these bodies towards regions closer to\nthe star than the snowline is not negligible and this flux of volatiles can be\nestimated for a given distribution of solid body sizes and compositions. A\nsimple expression for surface sublimation is applicable for a homogeneous body\nconsisting of only dust and water ice without a dust mantle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 10:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

Standard derivations neglect a term of\nform $\\nabla\\cdot[n\\nabla L n]$, where $n$ is the scaled density profile and\n$L$ is a linear operator. We show that this term makes a significant\ncontribution to the stability of the crystal, and dropping this term from the\ntheory forces another approximation, that of replacing the logarithmic term\nfrom the ideal gas contribution to the free energy with its truncated Taylor\nexpansion, to yield a polynomial in $n$. However, the consequences of doing\nthis are the presence of an additional spinodal in the phase diagram, so the\nliquid is predicted first to freeze and then to melt again as the density is\nincreased; and other periodic structures are erroneously predicted to be\nthermodynamic equilibria. A second approximation is to replace $L$ by a\ngradient expansion. This leads to the possibility of solutions failing to exist\nabove a certain value of the average density. We illustrate these conclusions\nwith a simple model two-dimensional fluid. The consequences of the PFC\napproximations are that the phase diagram is both qualitatively incorrect, in\nthat it has a stripe phase, and quantitatively incorrect (by orders of\nmagnitude) regarding the properties of the crystal. Thus, although PFC models\nare successful as phenomenological models of crystallisation, we find it\nimpossible to derive the PFC model as an accurate approximation to DDFT,\nwithout introducing spurious artefacts. However, making a simple one-mode\napproximation for the logarithm of the density distribution is surprisingly\naccurate, which gives a tantalising hint that accurate PFC-type theories may\ninstead be derived for the field $\\log(\\rho(x))$, rather than for the density\nprofile itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 11:35:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

It is commonly approached by averaging procedures that deal with\nliteral expressions in expanded form. However, there are cases in which the\ncorrect description of the dynamics may require full, contrary to simplified,\npotential models, as is, for instance, the case of low-altitude,\nhigh-inclination lunar orbits. In these cases, dealing with literal expressions\nis yet possible with the help of modern symbolic algebra systems, for which\nmemory handling is no longer an issue. Still, the efficient evaluation of the\naveraged expressions related to a high fidelity potential is often jeopardized\nfor the expanded character of the output of the automatic algebraic process,\nwhich unavoidably provides huge expressions that commonly comprise tens of\nthousands of literal terms. Rearrangement of the output to generate an\nefficient numerical code may solve the problem, but automatization of this kind\nof post-processing is a non trivial task due to the ad-hoc heuristic\nsimplification procedures involved in the optimization process. However, in\nthose cases in which the coupling of different perturbations is not of\nrelevance for the analysis, the averaging procedure may preserve the main\nfeatures of the structure of the potential model, thus avoiding the need of the\ntypical blind computer-based brut force perturbation approach. Indeed, we show\nhow standard recursions in the literature may be used to efficiently replace\nthe brut force approach, in this way avoiding the need of further\nsimplification to improve performance evaluation. In particular, Kaula's\nseminal recursion formulas for the gravity potential reveal clearly superior to\nthe use of both expanded expressions and other recursions more recently\nproposed in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 12:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

Although the geologic evidence generally supports a warmer\nand wetter climate, climate models have had difficulty simulating such a\nscenario, leading some to suggest that the observed fluvial geology (e.g.\nvalley networks, modified landscapes) on the Martian surface, could have formed\nin a cold climate instead. However, as we have originally predicted using a\nsingle-column radiative-convective climate model [Ramirez et al. 2014a],\nwarming from CO2-H2 collision-induced absorption (CIA) on a volcanically active\nearly Mars could have raised mean surface temperatures above the freezing\npoint, with later calculations showing that this is achievable with hydrogen\nconcentrations as low as ~1%. Nevertheless, these predictions should be tested\nagainst more complex models. Here, we use an advanced energy balance model that\nincludes a northern lowlands ocean to show that mean surface temperatures near\nor slightly above the freezing point of water were necessary to carve the\nvalley networks. Our scenario is consistent with a relatively large ocean as\nhas been suggested. Valley network distributions would have been global prior\nto subsequent removal processes. At lower mean surface temperatures and smaller\nocean sizes, precipitation and surface erosion efficiency diminish. The warm\nperiod may have been ~< 10 million years, perhaps suggesting that episodic\nwarming mechanisms were not needed. Atmospheric collapse and permanently\nglaciated conditions occur once surface ice coverage exceeds a threshold\ndepending on CIA assumptions. Our results support an early warm and semi-arid\nclimate consistent with many geologic observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 14:09:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 2019 08:12:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 09:30:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-12"}

The\ntraffic model is Cellular Automaton rule 184, which has been shown to be a\nparameter-free representation of traffic flow, and is the most efficient\nimplementation of the Kinematic Wave model with triangular fundamental diagram.\nWe are interested in the steady-state performance of the system, both spatially\nand temporally: we consider a homogeneous grid network inscribed on a torus,\nwhich makes the network boundary-free, and drivers choose random routes. As a\nbenchmark we use the longest-queue-first (LQF) greedy algorithm. We find that:\n(i) a policy trained with supervised learning with only two examples\noutperforms LQF, (ii) random search is able to generate near-optimal policies,\n(iii) the prevailing average network occupancy during training is the major\ndeterminant of the effectiveness of DRL policies.

For occupancies > 75% during training, DRL policies perform very\npoorly for all traffic conditions, which means that DRL methods cannot learn\nunder highly congested conditions. We conjecture that DRL's inability to learn\nunder congestion might be explained by a property of urban networks found here,\nwhereby even a very bad policy produces an intersection throughput higher than\ndownstream capacity. This means that the actual throughput tends to be\nindependent of the policy.

Yet, there are known\noptimistic protocols that guarantee termination in a single communication round\nunder favorable conditions.\n  In this paper we present a generic optimizer than can turn any consensus\nprotocol into an optimized protocol that terminates in a single communication\nround whenever all nodes start with the same predetermined value and no\nByzantine failures occur (although node crashes are allowed). This is\nregardless of the network timing assumptions and additional oracle capabilities\nassumed by the base consensus protocol being optimized.\n  In the case of benign failures, our optimizer works whenever the number of\nfaulty nodes $f<n/2$. For Byzantine behavior, our optimizer's resiliency\ndepends on the validity variant sought. In the case of classical validity, it\ncan accommodate $f<n/4$ Byzantine failures.

The addition of such a shear load accelerates frictional aging\nwhile the aging rate of the real area of contact is unaffected. Moreover, a\nnegative static shear - pulling instead of pushing - slows frictional aging,\nbut similarly does not affect the aging of contacts. The origin of this shear\neffect on aging is geometrical. When shear load is increased, minute relative\ntilts between the two blocks prematurely erase interfacial memory prior to\nsliding, negating the effect of aging. Modifying the loading point of the\ninterface eliminates these tilts and as a result frictional aging rate becomes\ninsensitive to shear.

Therefore, efficient\nalgorithms for solving such SOECs need to limit the fraction of data points\nthat they use, which we refer to as algorithmic data complexity. Recent\nstochastic first order methods exhibit low data complexity when handling SOECs\nbut guarantee near-feasibility and near-optimality only at convergence. These\nmethods may thus return highly infeasible solutions when heuristically\nterminated, as is often the case, due to theoretical convergence criteria being\nhighly conservative. This issue limits the use of first order methods in\nseveral applications where the SOEC constraints encode implementation\nrequirements. We design a stochastic feasible level set method (SFLS) for SOECs\nthat has low data complexity and emphasizes feasibility before convergence.\nSpecifically, our level-set method solves a root-finding problem by calling a\nnovel first order oracle that computes a stochastic upper bound on the\nlevel-set function by extending mirror descent and online validation\ntechniques.

Numerical experiments on three diverse\napplications validate the low data complexity of SFLS relative to the former\napproach and highlight how SFLS finds feasible solutions with small optimality\ngaps significantly faster than the latter method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 12:59:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 01:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-03"}

Recently, there has been a growing interest in\nutilizing graph-structured data in computer science research communities.\nMethods that use relational data for stock market prediction have been recently\nproposed, but they are still in their infancy. First, the quality of collected\ninformation from different types of relations can vary considerably. No\nexisting work has focused on the effect of using different types of relations\non stock market prediction or finding an effective way to selectively aggregate\ninformation on different relation types. Furthermore, existing works have\nfocused on only individual stock prediction which is similar to the node\nclassification task. To address this, we propose a hierarchical attention\nnetwork for stock prediction (HATS) which uses relational data for stock market\nprediction. Our HATS method selectively aggregates information on different\nrelation types and adds the information to the representations of each company.\nSpecifically, node representations are initialized with features extracted from\na feature extraction module. HATS is used as a relational modeling module with\ninitialized node representations. Then, node representations with the added\ninformation are fed into a task-specific layer. Our method is used for\npredicting not only individual stock prices but also market index movements,\nwhich is similar to the graph classification task. The experimental results\nshow that performance can change depending on the relational data used. HATS\nwhich can automatically select information outperformed all the existing\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 07:29:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2019 06:50:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 08:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

Their\neffectiveness has led to their use in safety critical and autonomous systems,\nyet there is a dearth of cost-effective methods available for reasoning about\nthe behavior of a DNN. In this paper, we seek to expand the applicability and\nscalability of existing DNN verification techniques through DNN refactoring. A\nDNN refactoring defines (a) the transformation of the DNN's architecture, i.e.,\nthe number and size of its layers, and (b) the distillation of the learned\nrelationships between the input features and function outputs of the original\nto train the transformed network. Unlike with traditional code refactoring, DNN\nrefactoring does not guarantee functional equivalence of the two networks, but\nrather it aims to preserve the accuracy of the original network while producing\na simpler network that is amenable to more efficient property verification. We\npresent an automated framework for DNN refactoring, and demonstrate its\npotential effectiveness through three case studies on networks used in\nautonomous systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 21:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-22"}

This\nis done by moving away, from the fundamental level, the assumption that the\nspin space of bare photons should (effectively) possess the same properties as\nthose of free photons observed experimentally. Within this formulation, bare\nphotons with zero momentum can not be neglected when constructing the photon\nfield; and an explicit expression for the related part of the photon field is\nderived. When a local gauge transformation is performed on the electron field,\nthis expression predicts a change that turns out to be equal to what the gauge\nsymmetry requires for the gauge field. This gives an explicit mechanism, by\nwhich the photon field may change under gauge transformations in QED.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 13:34:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 03:47:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

The book is dedicated to the art of\nfitting a trajectory model to those geodetic time series in order to extract\naccurate geophysical information with realistic error bars in geodymanics and\nenvironmental geodesy related studies. In the vast amount of the literature\npublished on this topic in the past 25 years, we are specifically interested in\nparametric algorithms which are estimating both functional and stochastic\nmodels using various Bayesian statistical tools (maximum likelihood, Monte\nCarlo Markov chain, Kalman filter, least squares variance component estimation,\ninformation criteria). This chapter will focus on how the parameters of the\ntrajectory model can be estimated. It is meant to give researchers new to this\ntopic an easy introduction to the theory with references to key books and\narticles where more details can be found. In addition, we hope that it\nrefreshes some of the details for the more experienced readers. We pay special\nattention to the modelling of the noise which has received much attention in\nthe literature in the last years and highlight some of the numerical aspects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 2019 20:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-30"}
