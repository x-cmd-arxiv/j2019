Hence, blockchain-based IDMSs, which could\nbenefit both users and businesses, are beginning to proliferate. This work\ncategorizes these systems into a taxonomy based on differences in blockchain\narchitectures, governance models, and other salient features.

Consequently, most of the cellular network providers either\ngive up using AQMs or use conservative offline configurations for them.\nHowever, these choices will significantly impact the performance of the\nemerging interactive and highly delay sensitive applications such as virtual\nreality and vehicle-to-vehicle communications.\n  Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the problems of existing AQM schemes\nand show that they are not suitable options to support ultra-low latency\napplications in a highly dynamic network such as current and future cellular\nnetworks. Moreover, we believe that achieving good performance does not\nnecessarily come from complex drop rate calculation algorithms or complicated\nAQM techniques. Consequently, we propose BoDe an extremely simple and\ndeployment friendly AQM scheme to bound the queuing delay of served packets and\nsupport ultra-low latency applications.\n  We have evaluated BoDe in extensive trace-based evaluations using cellular\ntraces from 3 different service providers in the US and compared its\nperformance with state-of-the-art AQM designs including CoDel and PIE under a\nvariety of streaming applications, video conferencing applications, and various\nrecently proposed TCP protocols.

First, the optimization problem\ncorresponding to the secrecy capacity of the MIMOME channel is converted to an\nequivalent optimization based on Givens rotations and eigenvalue decomposition\nof the covariance matrix. In this new formulation, precoder is a rotation\nmatrix which results in a positive semi-definite (PSD) covariance matrix by\nconstruction. This removes the PSD matrix constraint and makes the problem\neasier to tackle. Next, a Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS)-based\nalgorithm is developed to find the rotation and power allocation parameters.\nFurther, the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD)-based precoding is\nused to initialize this algorithm. The proposed rotation-BFGS method provides\nan efficient approach to find a near-optimal transmit strategy for the MIMOME\nchannel and outperforms various state-of-the-art analytical and numerical\nmethods.

One of the main challenges of designing\na numerical method for this problem is that boundary layers occurring in the\nconvection-dominated case can lead to non-physical oscillations in the\nnumerical approximation, often referred to as Gibbs phenomena. The idea of this\narticle is to consider the approximation problem as a residual minimization in\ndual norms in Lq-type Sobolev spaces, with 1 < q < $\\infty$. We then apply a\nnon-standard, non-linear PetrovGalerkin discretization, that is applicable to\nreflexive Banach spaces such that the space itself and its dual are strictly\nconvex. Similar to discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin methods, this method is based\non minimizing the residual in a dual norm. Replacing the intractable dual norm\nby a suitable discrete dual norm gives rise to a non-linear inexact mixed\nmethod. This generalizes the Petrov-Galerkin framework developed in the context\nof discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin methods to more general Banach spaces. For the\nconvection-diffusion-reaction equation, this yields a generalization of a\nsimilar approach from the L2-setting to the Lq-setting. A key advantage of\nconsidering a more general Banach space setting is that, in certain cases, the\noscillations in the numerical approximation vanish as q tends to 1, as we will\ndemonstrate using a few simple numerical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 18:18:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

For the binary neutron star hypothesis, we find that we\ncannot rule out the majority of theoretical models considered.

We discuss the possible outcomes in the\ncase of a binary neutron star merger, finding that all scenarios from prompt\ncollapse to long-lived or even stable remnants are possible. For long-lived\nremnants, we place an upper limit of 1.9 kHz on the rotation rate. If a black\nhole was formed any time after merger and the coalescing stars were slowly\nrotating, then the maximum baryonic mass of non-rotating neutron stars is at\nmost 3.05 $M_\\odot$, and three equations of state considered here can be ruled\nout.

In transcription, annotators would transcribe audio files provided\nby the researchers; in recording, annotators would record their voice by\nreading provided texts. We highlight two properties of this toolkit. First,\nSANTLR has a very user-friendly User Interface (UI). Both researchers and\nannotators may use this simple web interface to interact. There is no\nrequirement for the annotators to have any expertise in audio or text\nprocessing. The toolkit would handle all preprocessing and postprocessing\nsteps. Second, we employ a multi-step ranking mechanism facilitate the\nannotation process. In particular, the toolkit would give higher priority to\nutterances which are easier to annotate and are more beneficial to achieving\nthe goal of the annotation, e.g. quickly training an acoustic model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 21:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}

Recent deep learning based methods have shown\nimproved results by regressing likelihood maps instead of regressing the\ncoordinates directly. However, setting the precision of these regression\ntargets during the training is a cumbersome process since it creates a\ntrade-off between trainability vs localization accuracy. Using precise targets\nintroduces a significant sampling bias and hence makes the training more\ndifficult, whereas using imprecise targets results in inaccurate landmark\ndetectors. In this paper, we introduce \"Adaloss\", an objective function that\nadapts itself during the training by updating the target precision based on the\ntraining statistics. This approach does not require setting problem-specific\nparameters and shows improved stability in training and better localization\naccuracy during inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethod in three different applications of landmark localization: 1) the\nchallenging task of precisely detecting catheter tips in medical X-ray images,\n2) localizing surgical instruments in endoscopic images, and 3) localizing\nfacial features on in-the-wild images where we show state-of-the-art results on\nthe 300-W benchmark dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 21:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}

The massive size and streaming nature of these networks allow\nonly partial observation, since it is infeasible to analyze the entire network.\nUnder such scenarios, it is challenging to study the higher-order structural\nand connectivity patterns of streaming networks. In this work, we consider the\nfundamental problem of estimating the higher-order dependencies using adaptive\nsampling.

On the other\nhand, the Davies equation preserves complete positivity but is valid only in\nthe ultra-weak coupling limit and for systems with a finite level spacing,\nwhich makes it incompatible with arbitrarily fast time-dependent driving.

In order to minimize the estimation error, the scheduler\nneeds to use both while prioritizing packet transmissions. It is shown that a\nsimple index rule that calculates the value of information (VoI) of each\npacket, and then schedules the packet with the largest current value of VoI, is\noptimal. The VoI of a packet decreases with its age, and increases with the\nprecision of the source.

A lesion is zoned into a core\nassociated with irreversible necrosis typically located at the center of the\nlesion, while reversible hypoxic changes in the outer regions of the lesion are\ntermed as the penumbra. Early estimation of core and penumbra in ischaemic\nstroke is crucial for timely intervention with thrombolytic therapy to reverse\nthe damage and restore normalcy. Multisequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nis commonly employed for clinical diagnosis. However, a sequence singly has not\nbeen found to be sufficiently able to differentiate between core and penumbra,\nwhile a combination of sequences is required to determine the extent of the\ndamage. The challenge, however, is that with an increase in the number of\nsequences, it cognitively taxes the clinician to discover symptomatic\nbiomarkers in these images. In this paper, we present a data-driven fully\nautomated method for estimation of core and penumbra in ischaemic lesions using\ndiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) sequence\nmaps of MRI. The method employs recent developments in convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNN) for semantic segmentation in medical images. In the absence of\navailability of a large amount of labeled data, the CNN is trained using an\nadversarial approach employing cross-entropy as a segmentation loss along with\nlosses aggregated from three discriminators of which two employ relativistic\nvisual Turing test.

In this paper, we design a fully convolutional network (FCN),\nnamed MD-Net, to perform motion attribute estimation and feature description\nsimultaneously. MD-Net has a shared backbone network to extract features from\nthe input image and two network branches to complete each sub-task.

As such, given a deep neural network model and clean input\nsamples, it is very challenging to inspect and determine the existence of a\ntrojan backdoor. Recently, researchers design and develop several pioneering\nsolutions to address this acute problem. They demonstrate the proposed\ntechniques have a great potential in trojan detection. However, we show that\nnone of these existing techniques completely address the problem. On the one\nhand, they mostly work under an unrealistic assumption (e.g. assuming\navailability of the contaminated training database). On the other hand, the\nproposed techniques cannot accurately detect the existence of trojan backdoors,\nnor restore high-fidelity trojan backdoor images, especially when the triggers\npertaining to the trojan vary in size, shape and position. In this work, we\npropose TABOR, a new trojan detection technique. Conceptually, it formalizes a\ntrojan detection task as a non-convex optimization problem, and the detection\nof a trojan backdoor as the task of resolving the optimization through an\nobjective function. Different from the existing technique also modeling trojan\ndetection as an optimization problem, TABOR designs a new objective\nfunction--under the guidance of explainable AI techniques as well as\nheuristics--that could guide optimization to identify a trojan backdoor in a\nmore effective fashion. In addition, TABOR defines a new metric to measure the\nquality of a trojan backdoor identified. Using an anomaly detection method, we\nshow the new metric could better facilitate TABOR to identify intentionally\ninjected triggers in an infected model and filter out false alarms......\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 22:46:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 22:59:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-12"}

In light of this, we argue any quantitative\ntheory of consciousness, including IIT, should be invariant under isomorphisms\nif it is to avoid the existence of isomorphic philosophical zombies and the\nepistemological problems they pose.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Aug 2019 00:49:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 21:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Finite axially symmetric anti-plane shear\ndisplacements in such solids are considered. A general nonlinear wave equation\ngoverning such motions is derived. It is shown that in the case of\nMooney-Rivlin materials with standard quadratic fiber energy term, the\ndisplacements are governed by a linear cylindrical wave equation.\n  Extensions of the model onto the case when fibers have a radial projection,\nas well as onto a viscoelastic case taking into account dissipative effects,\nare considered; wave equations governing shear displacements in those cases are\nderived and analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 21:26:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-13"}
