Many previous studies proved that utilizing the additional\ninformation with rating data is helpful to improve the performance. However,\nexisting methods are limited in that 1) they ignore the fact that data contexts\nof rating and auxiliary matrices are different, 2) they have restricted\ncapability of expressing independence information of users or items, and 3)\nthey assume the relation between a user and an item is linear. We propose\nDaConA, a neural network based method for recommendation with a rating matrix\nand an auxiliary matrix. DaConA is designed with the following three main\nideas. First, we propose a data context adaptation layer to extract pertinent\nfeatures for different data contexts. Second, DaConA represents each entity\nwith latent interaction vector and latent independence vector. Unlike previous\nmethods, both of the two vectors are not limited in size. Lastly, while\nprevious matrix factorization based methods predict missing values through the\ninner-product of latent vectors, DaConA learns a non-linear function of them\nvia a neural network. We show that DaConA is a generalized algorithm including\nthe standard matrix factorization and the collective matrix factorization as\nspecial cases. Through comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets, we\nshow that DaConA provides the state-of-the-art accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 16:02:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-23"}

When IAV advection and\ndiffusion are both considered, the former is found to dominate infection\nkinetics, and a 10-fold increase in the virus production rate is required to\ncounter its effects. The MM predicts that advection prevents infection from\ndisseminating below the depth at which virus first deposits. Because virus is\nentrained upwards, the upper HRT sees the most virus, whereas the lower HRT\nsees far less. As such, infection peaks and resolves faster in the upper than\nin the lower HRT, making it appear as though infection progresses from the\nupper towards the lower HRT. When the spatial MM is expanded to include\ncellular regeneration and an immune response, it can capture the time course of\ninfection with a seasonal and an avian IAV strain by shifting parameters in a\nmanner consistent with what is expected to differ between these two types of\ninfection. The impact of antiviral therapy with neuraminidase inhibitors was\nalso investigated.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to focusing on some\nof the unanswered questions resulting from the use of meta-learning in time\nseries forecasting. Therefore, three main gaps in previous works are addressed\nincluding, analyzing various subsets of top forecasters as inputs for\nmeta-learners; evaluating the effect of forecasting error measures; and\nassessing the role of the dimensionality of the feature space on the\nforecasting errors of meta-learners. All of these objectives are achieved with\nthe help of a diverse state-of-the-art pool of forecasters and meta-learners.\nFor this purpose, first, a pool of forecasting algorithms is implemented on the\nNN5 competition dataset and ranked based on the two error measures. Then, six\nmachine-learning classifiers known as meta-learners, are trained on the\nextracted features of the time series in order to assign the most suitable\nforecasting method for the various subsets of the pool of forecasters.\nFurthermore, two-dimensionality reduction methods are implemented in order to\ninvestigate the role of feature space dimension on the performance of\nmeta-learners.

However there are still kinematic regions where more data are\nneeded to help constrain global PDF extractions, such as the ratio of the sea\nquark distributions $\\bar{d}$/$\\bar{u}$ near the valence region. Furthermore,\ncurrent measurements appear to suggest different high-$x$ behaviors of this\nratio. The $W$ cross section ratio ($W^+$/$W^-$) is sensitive to the\nunpolarized quark distributions at large $Q^2$ set by the $W$ mass. Such a\nmeasurement can be used to help constrain the $\\bar{d}$/$\\bar{u}$ ratio.

At these kinematics\nSTAR is sensitive to quark distributions near $x$ of 0.16.

The vehicle collects items in the pickup area and\nloads them into its container, a horizontal stack. After performing all pickup\noperations, the vehicle begins delivering the items in the delivery area.\nLoading and unloading operations must obey a partial Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)\npolicy, i.e., a version of the LIFO policy that may be violated within a given\nreloading depth. The objective of the DTSPPL is to minimize the total cost,\nwhich involves the total distance traveled by the vehicle and the number of\nitems that are unloaded and then reloaded due to violations of the standard\nLIFO policy.

However, different\ndomains usually have various textual relation descriptions and different label\nspace (the source label space is usually a superset of the target label space).\nTo solve these problems, we propose a novel model of relation-gated adversarial\nlearning for relation extraction, which extends the adversarial based domain\nadaptation. Experimental results have shown that the proposed approach\noutperforms previous domain adaptation methods regarding partial domain\nadaptation and can improve the accuracy of distance supervised relation\nextraction through fine-tuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 17:27:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-23"}

On the other hand, it is known that there exists a\nprecise relation between geometric actions and Berry phases defined in group\nrepresentations. Motivated by these connections, we elaborate on a relation\nbetween circuit complexity and the group theoretic Berry phase. As the simplest\nsetup relevant for holography, we discuss the case of two dimensional conformal\nfield theories. In the large central charge limit, we identify the\ncomputational cost function with the Berry connection in the unitary\nrepresentation of the Virasoro group. We then use the latter identification to\nexpress the Berry phase in terms of the Virasoro circuit complexity. The former\ncan be seen as the holonomy of the Berry connection along the path in the group\nmanifold which defines the protocol. In addition, we derive a proportionality\nrelation between Virasoro circuit complexity and the logarithm of the inner\nproduct between a particularly chosen reference state and the prepared target\nstate. In this sense, the logarithmic formula turns out to be approximating the\ncomplexity up to some additive constant if the building blocks of the circuit\nare taken to be the underlying symmetry gates. Predictions based on this\nformula have recently been shown to coincide with the holographic complexity\nproposals and the path integral optimization procedure. The found connections\nmay therefore help to better understand such coincidences. We also discuss that\nour findings, put together with earlier observations, may suggest a connection\nbetween the Virasoro Berry phase and the complexity measure in the path\nintegral optimization proposal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 17:46:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-23"}

To\nunderstand and predict these signatures, one must account for the fact that the\ndynamics of any critical fluctuations must be out-of-equilibrium: because of\ncritical slowing down, the fluctuations cannot stay in equilibrium as the\ndroplet of QGP produced in a collision expands and cools. Furthermore, their\nout-of-equilibrium dynamics must also influence the hydrodynamic evolution of\nthe cooling droplet. The recently developed Hydro+ formalism allows for a\nconsistent description of both the hydrodynamics and the out-of-equilibrium\nfluctuations, including the feedback between them.

Within this setup, we show that we can\nquantitatively capture non-equilibrium phenomena, including critical\nfluctuations over a range of scales and memory effects. Furthermore, we\nillustrate the interplay between the dynamics of the fluctuations and the\nhydrodynamic flow of the fireball: as the fluid cools and flows, the dynamical\nfluctuations lag relative to how they would evolve if they stayed in\nequilibrium; there is then a backreaction on the flow itself due to the\nout-of-equilibrium fluctuations; and, in addition, the radial flow transports\nfluctuations outwards by advection. Within our model, we find that the\nbackreaction from the out-of-equilibrium fluctuations does not yield\ndramatically large effects in the hydrodynamic variables.

The supernova exploded in\nthe nearby spiral galaxy NGC 5337 in a relatively highly extinguished\nenvironment. The transient showed prominent narrow Balmer lines in emission at\nall times and a slow rise to maximum in all bands.

The observables are consistent with continuous interaction\nbetween the supernova ejecta and a dense and extended H-rich circumstellar\nmedium. The presence of such an extended and dense medium is difficult to\nreconcile with standard stellar evolution models, since the metallicity at the\nposition of SN 2015da seems to be slightly subsolar.

However, the impact of oxide interfaces on spin dynamics in\nsuch heterostructures remains an open question. Here, we investigate the spin\ndynamics and chemical and magnetic depth profiles of 15-nm-thick MAFO\ncoherently interfaced with an isostructural $\\approx$1-8-nm-thick overlayer of\nparamagnetic CoCr$_2$O$_4$ (CCO) as an all-oxide model system. Compared to MAFO\nwithout an overlayer, effective Gilbert damping in MAFO/CCO is enhanced by a\nfactor of $>$3, irrespective of the CCO overlayer thickness. We attribute this\ndamping enhancement to spin scattering at the $\\sim$1-nm-thick chemically\ndisordered layer at the MAFO/CCO interface, rather than spin pumping or\nproximity-induced magnetism. Our results indicate that damping in ferrite-based\nheterostructures is strongly influenced by interfacial chemical disorder, even\nif the thickness of the disordered layer is a small fraction of the ferrite\nthickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 01:44:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Oct 2019 03:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-21"}

However, active transfer of heat or thermal\nenergy under a large temperature difference promptly destroys the exergy, which\nis the free-energy component of thermal energy, and this issue has remained\nunaddressed. Herein, we describe a thermoelectrochemical conversion to\npartially recover presently lost exergy in forced convection cooling. We design\na test cell in which an electrolyte liquid is forced through a channel formed\nbetween two parallel electrodes and the hot-side electrode simulates an object\nto be cooled. Our investigations show that the narrower interelectrode channels\nafford higher cooling and power generation performances. The mass transfer\nresistance is the most dominant type of resistance for all the conditions\ntested and the charge transfer kinetics is likely to be controlled by\nviscosity. The dependence of the generated power on the flow rate is caused by\nthe change in the diffusion coefficient of redox species with temperature. As\nan evaluation measure for such forced-flow thermocells, the gain (\\Lambda)\n--defined as the ratio of the generated power to the hydrodynamic pumping work\nrequired to force the liquid through the cell-- is introduced. \\Lambda is above\nunity in a certain flow rate region. This demonstrates that such a system can\ngenerate more electric power than the pump work required to drive the liquid\nthrough the cell, suggesting its potential to partly recover presently lost\nexergy of thermal energy as electricity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 03:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In this sense, ground transportation in\ndense urban environments has been facing challenges for many years (e.g.,\ncongestion and resilience). One import outcome of the effort made toward the\ncreation of new concepts for enhancing urban transportation is the Urban Air\nMobility (UAM) concept. UAM aims at enhancing city transportation services\nusing manned and unmanned vehicles. However, these operations bring many\nchallenges to be faced, e.g., the interaction between the controller agent and\nautonomous vehicles. Furthermore, trajectory planning is not a simple task due\nto several factors. Firstly, the trajectories must consider a reduced minimum\nseparation as eVTOL vehicle are expected to operate in complex urban\nenvironments. This leads the trajectory planning process to observe safety\nprimitives more restrictively once the airspace is expected to comport many\nvehicles that follow small minimum separation standards. Thereupon, the main\ngoal of the Trajectory-Based UAM Operations Simulator (TUS) is to simulate the\nTrajectory-Based UAM operations in urban environments considering the presence\nof both manned and unmanned eVTOL vehicles. For this, a Discrete Event\nSimulation (DES) approach is adopted, which considers an input (i.e., the eVTOL\nvehicles, their origin and destination, and their respective trajectories) and\nproduces an output (which describes if the trajectories are safe and the\nelapsed operation time). The main contribution of this simulation tool is to\nprovide a simulated environment for testing and measuring the effectiveness\n(e.g., flight duration) of trajectories planned for eVTOL vehicles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 03:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-26"}

However, its thermal conductivity is\nsignificantly lower than that of other wide bandgap semiconductors, which will\nimpact its ability to be used in high power density applications. Thermal\nmanagement in Ga2O3 electronics will be the key for device reliability,\nespecially for high power and high frequency devices. Similar to the method of\ncooling GaN-based high electron mobility transistors by integrating it with\nhigh thermal conductivity diamond substrates, this work studies the possibility\nof heterogeneous integration of Ga2O3 with diamond for thermal management of\nGa2O3 devices. In this work, Ga2O3 was deposited onto single crystal diamond\nsubstrates by ALD and the thermal properties of ALD-Ga2O3 thin films and\nGa2O3-diamond interfaces with different interface pretreatments were measured\nby TDTR. We observed very low thermal conductivity of these Ga2O3 thin films\ndue to the extensive phonon grain boundary scattering resulting from the\nnanocrystalline nature of the Ga2O3 film. However, the measured thermal\nboundary conductance (TBC) of the Ga2O3-diamond interfaces are about 10 times\nlarger than that of the Van der Waals bonded Ga2O3 diamond interfaces, which\nindicates the significant impact of interface bonding on TBC. Furthermore, the\nTBC of the Ga-rich and O-rich Ga2O3-diamond interfaces are about 20% smaller\nthan that of the clean interface, indicating interface chemistry affects\ninterfacial thermal transport. Overall, this study shows that a high TBC can be\nobtained from strong interfacial bonds across Ga2O3-diamond interfaces,\nproviding a promising route to improving the heat dissipation from Ga2O3\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 05:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

Using random matrix theory, this paper considers the\nestimation of integrated covariance (ICV) matrices of high-dimensional\ndiffusion processes based on multiple high-frequency observations. We start by\nstudying the estimator, the time-variation adjusted realized covariance (TVA)\nmatrix, proposed in Zheng and Li (2011) without microstructure noise.

However, in practice, the observed prices are always contaminated by the\nmarket microstructure noise. Thus the limiting behavior of pre-averaging\naveraged TVA matrices is studied based on the noisy multiple observations. We\nshow that for processes in class C, the pre-averaging averaged TVA has\ndesirable properties that it eliminates the effects of microstructure noise and\nmultiple transactions, and its LSD depends solely on that of the ICV matrix.\nFurther, three types of nonlinear shrinkage estimators of ICV are proposed\nbased on high-frequency noisy multiple observations.

Physical rotation of a quantum system will\ntherefore affect fundamental quantum operations, such as spin rotations in\nprojective Hilbert space, but these effects are subtle and experimentally\nchallenging to observe due to the fragility of quantum coherence. Here we\nreport a measurement of a single-electron-spin phase shift arising directly\nfrom physical rotation, without transduction through magnetic fields or\nancillary spins. This phase shift is observed by measuring the phase difference\nbetween a microwave driving field and a rotating two-level electron spin\nsystem, and can accumulate nonlinearly in time. We detect the nonlinear phase\nusing spin-echo interferometry of a single nitrogen-vacancy qubit in a diamond\nrotating at 200,000rpm. Our measurements demonstrate the fundamental\nconnections between spin, physical rotation and quantum phase, and will be\napplicable in schemes where the rotational degree of freedom of a quantum\nsystem is not fixed, such as spin-based rotation sensors and trapped\nnanoparticles containing spins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 06:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

The main issues related to the cosmological application of luminosity\nestimates from xA quasar line widths are the identification of proper emission\nlines whose broadening is predominantly virial over a wide range of luminosity,\nand the assessment of the effect of the emitting region orientation with\nrespect to the line of sight.

One probable reason for low reproducibility is\ninsufficient sample size, resulting in low power and low positive predictive\nvalue. It has been suggested that insufficient sample-size choice is driven by\na combination of scientific competition and 'positive publication bias'. Here\nwe formalize this intuition in a simple model, in which scientists choose\neconomically rational sample sizes, balancing the cost of experimentation with\nincome from publication. Specifically, assuming that a scientist's income\nderives only from 'positive' findings (positive publication bias) and that\nindividual samples cost a fixed amount, allows to leverage basic statistical\nformulas into an economic optimality prediction. We find that if effects have\ni) low base probability, ii) small effect size or iii) low grant income per\npublication, then the rational (economically optimal) sample size is small.\nFurthermore, for plausible distributions of these parameters we find a robust\nemergence of a bimodal distribution of obtained statistical power and low\noverall reproducibility rates, both matching empirical findings. Finally, we\nexplore conditional equivalence testing as a means to align economic incentives\nwith adequate sample sizes. Overall, the model describes a simple mechanism\nexplaining both the prevalence and the persistence of small sample sizes, and\nis well suited for empirical validation. It proposes economic rationality, or\neconomic pressures, as a principal driver of irreproducibility and suggests\nstrategies to change this.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 07:45:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 08:59:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 14:27:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 09:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

In the pebble\naccretion scenario, planets grow to the pebble isolation mass, at which the\nplanet carves a small gap in the gas disc halting the pebble flux and thus its\ngrowth. The pebble isolation mass scales with the disc's aspect ratio, which\ndirectly depends on the disc structure. I compare the growth of super-Earths in\nviscously heated discs and discs purely heated by the central star with\nsuper-Earth observations. This allows two formation pathways of super-Earths to\nbe distinguished in the inner systems. Planets growing within 1 Myr in the\nviscously heated inner disc reach pebble isolation masses that correspond\ndirectly to the inferred masses of the Kepler observations for systems that\nfeature planets in resonance or not in resonance. However, to explain the\nperiod ratio distribution of Kepler planets -- where most Kepler planet pairs\nare not in mean motion resonance configurations -- a fraction of these resonant\nchains has to be broken. In case the planets are born early in a viscously\nheated disc, these resonant chains thus have to be broken without planetary\nmergers. If super-Earths form either late or in purely passive discs, the\npebble isolation mass is too small to explain the Kepler observations, implying\nthat planetary mergers are important for the final system architecture.\nResonant planetary systems thus have to experience mergers already during the\ngas disc phase, so the planets can get trapped in resonance after reaching 5-10\nEarth masses. In case instabilities are dominating the system architecture, the\nsystems should not be flat with mutually inclined orbits. This implies that\nfuture observations of planetary systems with RV and transits could distinguish\nbetween these two formation channels of super-Earth.

In particular, a time slot is assigned to\nserve each group, whereas the users in the corresponding group are served based\non power-domain NOMA technique. Furthermore, simultaneous wireless power and\ninformation transfer technique is utilized to simultaneously harvest energy and\ndecode information at each user. Therefore, each user splits the received\nsignal into two parts, namely, energy harvesting part and information decoding\npart. In particular, we jointly determine the power allocation and power\nsplitting ratios for all users to minimize the transmit power under minimum\nrate and minimum energy harvesting requirements at each user. Furthermore, this\njoint design is a non-convex problem in nature. Hence, we employ successive\ninterference cancellation to overcome these non-convexity issues and determine\nthe design parameters (i.e., the power allocations and the power splitting\nratios). In simulation results, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed\nhybrid TDMA-NOMA design and show that it outperforms the conventional TDMA\nscheme in terms of transmit power consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 08:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-26"}

We took advantage of this\nto remove the telluric and stellar lines using SYSREM, a principal component\nanalysis algorithm. The residual spectra contain the signal from thousands of\nplanetary molecular lines well below the noise level.

The signal is blueshifted by --5.2 $^{+2.6}_{-1.3}$ km\ns$^{-1}$, which, despite the error bars, is a firm indication of day-to-night\nwinds at the terminator of this hot Jupiter. Additionally, we performed a\nmulti-band study for the detection of H$_2$O individually from the three NIR\nbands covered by CARMENES.

Hence, traditional texture-based feature matching\nmethods cannot be directly applied to obtain stereo correspondences. To tackle\nthis problem, a multi-spectral visual odometry method without explicit stereo\nmatching is proposed in this paper.

Modeling conversation is an\nimportant task in natural language processing and artificial intelligence.\nWhile chatbots can be used for various tasks, in general they have to\nunderstand users' utterances and provide responses that are relevant to the\nproblem at hand.\n  In my work, I conduct an in-depth survey of recent literature, examining over\n70 publications related to chatbots published in the last 3 years. Then, I\nproceed to make the argument that the very nature of the general conversation\ndomain demands approaches that are different from current state-of-of-the-art\narchitectures. Based on several examples from the literature I show why current\nchatbot models fail to take into account enough priors when generating\nresponses and how this affects the quality of the conversation. In the case of\nchatbots, these priors can be outside sources of information that the\nconversation is conditioned on like the persona or mood of the conversers. In\naddition to presenting the reasons behind this problem, I propose several ideas\non how it could be remedied.\n  The next section focuses on adapting the very recent Transformer model to the\nchatbot domain, which is currently state-of-the-art in neural machine\ntranslation.

Also, this chapter demonstrates that feature learning in a\nsupervised manner is more effective than using conventional handcrafted\nfeatures for automatic detection of knee joints and fine-grained knee OA image\nclassification. In the general machine learning approach to automatically\nassess knee OA severity, the first step is to localize the region of interest\nthat is to detect and extract the knee joint regions from the radiographs, and\nthe next step is to classify the localized knee joints based on a radiographic\nclassification scheme such as Kellgren and Lawrence grades. First, the existing\napproaches for detecting (or localizing) the knee joint regions based on\nhandcrafted features are reviewed and outlined. Next, three new approaches are\nintroduced: 1) to automatically detect the knee joint region using a fully\nconvolutional network, 2) to automatically assess the radiographic knee OA\nusing CNNs trained from scratch for classification and regression of knee joint\nimages to predict KL grades in ordinal and continuous scales, and 3) to\nquantify the knee OA severity optimizing a weighted ratio of two loss\nfunctions: categorical cross entropy and mean-squared error using\nmulti-objective convolutional learning and ordinal regression.

The goal of this\nPhD work is to strengthen our knowledge on optical, optoelectronic and\ntransport properties of these nanocrystals, in order to design an infrared\ndetector. To do so, we studied the electronic structure of HgSe and HgTe for\ndifferent sizes and surface chemistries.

In Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices,\nhowever, the number of qubits is highly limited and quantum operation error and\nqubit coherence are not negligible. Besides, the connectivity of physical\nqubits in a quantum processing unit (QPU) is also strictly constrained.\nThereby, additional operations like SWAP gates have to be inserted to satisfy\nthis constraint while preserving the functionality of the original circuit.\nThis process is known as quantum circuit transformation. Adding additional\ngates will increase both the size and depth of a quantum circuit and therefore\ncause further decay of the performance of a quantum circuit. Thus it is crucial\nto minimize the number of added gates. In this paper, we propose an efficient\nmethod to solve this problem. We first choose by using simulated annealing an\ninitial mapping which fits well with the input circuit and then, with the help\nof a heuristic cost function, stepwise apply the best selected SWAP gates until\nall quantum gates in the circuit can be executed.

Its space complexity is\nquadratic to the number of edges in the QPU.

A Bayesian additive framework then combines\nmultiple layers of partitioned SGPs, capturing both global trends and local\nrefinements with efficient computations. The model addresses both the problem\nof efficiency in fitting a full Gaussian process regression model and the\nproblem of prediction performance associated with a single SGP.

The crucial trade-off becomes\nchoosing between many simpler local model components or fewer complex global\nmodel components, which the practitioner can sensibly tune.

The response of\ndifferent dust species to the gravitational perturbation induced by a planet\ndepends on the drag stopping time - a function of the generally unknown local\ngas density. Small dust grains, being stuck to the gas, show spirals.

In the last decades, the shift current in the visible wavelength region\nwas limited to be 10 uA/V2 . By scanning the insulators with chiral structure,\nwe found a class of compounds with photoconductivity ranging from 20 to 80\nuA/V2 , which is approximately one order of magnitude larger than that reported\nin other real materials. This work illustrates that the compounds with chiral\nstructure can host both quantum CPGE and a strong shift current in the second\norder optical response.

To achieve this goal, the high-order mesh\ngenerator from CAD geometry called NekMesh is adapted for surface mesh\ngeneration in comparison to traditional meshes with non-negligible geometric\napproximation error. Two types of numerical tests are considered. Firstly, the\naccuracy of differential operators is compared for various p on a curved\nelement of the sphere.

The existed\naccess control mechanism can only prevent unauthorized users from accessing the\nsystem, but they can not prevent those authorized users (insiders) from\nattacking the system. To address this problem, we propose a behavior-aware\nservice access control mechanism using security policy monitoring for SOA\nsystem. In our mechanism, a monitor program can supervise consumer's behaviors\nin run time. By means of trustful behavior model (TBM), if finding the\nconsumer's behavior is of misusing, the monitor will deny its request. If\nfinding the consumer's behavior is of malicious, the monitor will early\nterminate the consumer's access authorizations in this session or add the\nconsumer into the Blacklist, whereby the consumer will not access the system\nfrom then on. In order to evaluate the feasibility of proposed mechanism, we\nimplement a prototype system. The final results illustrate that our mechanism\ncan effectively monitor consumer's behaviors and make effective responses when\nmalicious behaviors really occur in run time.

We suggest that the fluorine rich\ngrowth condition can play a key role in enhancing the luminescence efficiency\nby facilitating the Yb-clustering and suppressing the defect quenchers in bulk.\nDetailed energetics of defect aggregation not only well explains the\nexperimentally favored Yb-clustering but also presents $n$- or $p$-type doping\nmethod for the cluster control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 07:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-06"}

It remains a research direction to devise novel\narchitectures to further benefit the segmentation. In this paper, we develop an\nACE-net that aims to enhance the feature representation and utilization by\naugmenting the contracting and expansive paths. In particular, we augment the\npaths by the recently proposed advanced techniques including ASPP, dense\nconnection and deep supervision mechanisms, and novel connections such as\ndirectly connecting the raw image to the expansive side. With these\naugmentations, ACE-net can utilize features from multiple sources, scales and\nreception fields to segment while still maintains a relative simple\narchitecture. Experiments on two typical biomedical segmentation tasks validate\nits effectiveness, where highly competitive results are obtained in both tasks\nwhile ACE-net still runs fast at inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 07:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}
