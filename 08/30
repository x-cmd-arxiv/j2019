The\nprediction of relations requires a deep understanding of the semantic meanings\nof sentence pairs. As implicit discourse relation recognizer has to carefully\ntackle the semantic similarity of the given sentence pairs and the severe data\nsparsity issue exists in the meantime, it is supposed to be beneficial from\nmastering the entire training data. Thus in this paper, we propose a novel\nmemory mechanism to tackle the challenges for further performance improvement.\nThe memory mechanism is adequately memorizing information by pairing\nrepresentations and discourse relations of all training instances, which right\nfills the slot of the data-hungry issue in the current implicit discourse\nrelation recognizer. Our experiments show that our full model with memorizing\nthe entire training set reaches new state-of-the-art against strong baselines,\nwhich especially for the first time exceeds the milestone of 60% accuracy in\nthe 4-way task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 16:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-30"}

Biological machines have evolved to\ntransport cargo, facilitate folding of proteins and RNA, remodel chromatin and\nreplicate DNA. A common aspect of these machines is that their functions are\ndriven out of equilibrium. It is a challenge to provide a general framework for\nunderstanding the functions of biological machines, such as molecular motors,\nmolecular chaperones, and helicases. Using these machines as prototypical\nexamples, we describe a few general theoretical methods providing insights into\ntheir functions. Although the theories rely on coarse-graining of these complex\nsystems they have proven useful in not only accounting for many in vitro\nexperiments but also addressing questions such as how the trade-off between\nprecision, energetic costs and optimal performances are balanced. However, many\ncomplexities associated with biological machines will require one to go beyond\ncurrent theoretical methods. Simple point mutations in the enzyme could\ndrastically alter functions, making the motors bi-directional or result in\nunexpected diseases or dramatically restrict the capacity of molecular\nchaperones to help proteins fold. These examples are reminders that while the\nsearch for principles of generality in biology is intellectually stimulating,\none also ought to keep in mind that molecular details must be accounted for to\ndevelop a deeper understanding of processes driven by biological machines.\nGoing beyond generic descriptions of in vitro behavior to making genuine\nunderstanding of in vivo functions will likely remain a major challenge for\nsome time to come. The combination of careful experiments and the use of\nphysical principles will be useful in elucidating the rules governing the\nworkings of biological machines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 16:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

In single field inflationary models, such\nperturbations can be seeded as the inflaton overshoots a small barrier on its\nway down the potential. PBHs are then produced through two distinct mechanisms,\nduring the radiation era. The first one is the familiar collapse of large\nadiabatic overdensities. The second one is the collapse induced by relic\nbubbles where the inflaton field is trapped in a false vacuum, due to large\nbackward fluctuations which prevented horizon sized regions from overshooting\nthe barrier. We consider (numerically and analytically) the effect of\nnon-Gaussianities on the threshold for overdensities to collapse into a PBH.\nSince typical high peaks have some dispersion in their shape or profile, we\nalso consider the effect of such dispersion on the corresponding threshold for\ncollapse. With these results we estimate the most likely channel for PBH\nproduction as a function of the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\\rm NL}$. We also\ncompare the threshold for collapse coming from the perturbative versus the non\nperturbative template for the non-Gaussianity arising in this model.

Some eukaryotic cells can swim, but\ncells more commonly adhere to and crawl along the extracellular matrix. We\nstudy the relationship between hydrodynamics and adhesion that describe whether\na cell is swimming, crawling, or combining these motions. Our simple model of a\ncell, based on the three-sphere swimmer, is capable of both swimming and\ncrawling. As cell-matrix adhesion strength increases, the influence of\nhydrodynamics on migration diminish. Cells with significant adhesion can crawl\nwith speeds much larger than their nonadherent, swimming counterparts.

These models are the smooth torus by Fritz et al. (2006),\nthe clumpy torus by Nenkova et al. (2008B), the clumpy torus by Hoenig &\nKishimoto (2010), the two phase torus by Siebenmorgen et al. (2015), the two\nphase torus by Stalevski et al. (2016), and the wind model by Hoenig &\nKishimoto (2017). The first paper explores discrimination among models and the\nparameter restriction using synthetic spectra (Gonzalez-Martin et al. 2019A).\nHere we perform spectral fitting of a sample of 110 AGN drawn from the\nSwift/BAT survey with Spitzer/IRS spectroscopic data. The aim is to explore\nwhich is the model that describes better the data and the resulting parameters.\nThe clumpy wind-disk model by Hoenig & Kishimoto (2017) provides good fits for\n~50% of the sample, and the clumpy torus model by Nenkova et al. (2008B) is\ngood at describing ~30% of the objects. The wind-disk model by Hoenig &\nKishimoto (2017) is better for reproducing the mid-infrared spectra of Type-1\nSeyferts while Type-2 Seyferts are equally fitted by both models. Large\nresiduals are found irrespective of the model used, indicating that the AGN\ndust continuum emission is more complex than predicted by the models or that\nthe parameter space is not well sampled. We found that all the resulting\nparameters for our AGN sample are roughly constrained to 10-20% of the\nparameter space. The derived outer radius of the torus is smaller for the\nsmooth torus by Fritz et al. (2006) and the two phase torus by Stalevski et al.\n(2016) than the one derived from the clumpy torus by (Nenkova et al. 2008B).\nCovering factors and line-of-sight viewing angles strongly depend on the model\nused. The total dust mass is the most robust derived quantity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

Agents have different labels and move in synchronous rounds\nalong links of the network. The above task is known as gathering and was\ntraditionally considered under the assumption that when some agents are at the\nsame node then they can talk. In this paper we ask the question of whether this\nability of talking is needed for gathering. The answer turns out to be no.\n  Our main contribution are two deterministic algorithms that always accomplish\ngathering in a much weaker model. We only assume that at any time an agent\nknows how many agents are at the node that it currently occupies but agents do\nnot see the labels of other co-located agents and cannot exchange any\ninformation with them. They also do not see other nodes than the current one.\nOur first algorithm works under the assumption that agents know a priori some\nupper bound N on the network size, and it works in time polynomial in N and in\nthe length l of the smallest label. Our second algorithm does not assume any a\npriori knowledge about the network but its complexity is exponential in the\nnetwork size and in the labels of agents. Its purpose is to show feasibility of\ngathering under this harsher scenario.\n  As a by-product of our techniques we obtain, in the same weak model, the\nsolution of the fundamental problem of leader election among agents. As an\napplication of our result we also solve, in the same model, the well-known\ngossiping problem: if each agent has a message at the beginning, we show how to\nmake all messages known to all agents, even without any a priori knowledge\nabout the network.

Despite their near-centuries-long\nrun of successes in signal analysis, here we show that flat power spectra can\nbe generated by highly complex processes, effectively hiding all inherent\nstructure in complex signals. Historically, this circumstance has been widely\nmisinterpreted, being taken as the renowned signature of \"structureless\" white\nnoise---the benchmark of randomness. We argue, in contrast, to the extent that\nmost real-world complex systems exhibit correlations beyond pairwise statistics\ntheir structures evade power spectra and other pairwise statistical measures.\nAs concrete physical examples, we demonstrate that fraudulent white noise hides\nthe predictable structure of both entangled quantum systems and chaotic\ncrystals.\n  To make these words of warning operational, we present constructive results\nthat explore how this situation comes about and the high toll it takes in\nunderstanding complex mechanisms. First, we give the closed-form solution for\nthe power spectrum of a very broad class of structurally-complex signal\ngenerators.

We first learn to detect object corners of various shapes\nin images and also to predict their 3D poses, by using training images of a\nsmall set of objects.

Methods: Using a dataset including 8,682 polysomnographs,\nwe develop deep neural networks to stage sleep from ECG and respiratory\nsignals. Five deep neural networks consisting of convolutional networks and\nlong short-term memory networks are trained to stage sleep using heart and\nbreathing, including the timing of R peaks from ECG, abdominal and chest\nrespiratory effort, and the combinations of these signals. Results: ECG in\ncombination with the abdominal respiratory effort achieve the best performance\nfor staging all five sleep stages with a Cohen's kappa of 0.600 (95% confidence\ninterval 0.599 -- 0.602); and 0.762 (0.760 -- 0.763) for discriminating awake\nvs. rapid eye movement vs. non-rapid eye movement sleep. The performance is\nbetter for young participants and for those with a low apnea-hypopnea index,\nwhile it is robust for commonly used outpatient medications.

In the high-dimensional\nsetting, model parameters are typically estimated by L1-regularized maximum\nlikelihood; yet, when applied to VAR models, this technique produces a sizable\ntrade-off between sparsity and bias with the choice of the regularization\nhyperparameter, and thus between causal discovery and prediction. That is,\nlow-bias estimation entails dense parameter selection, and sparse selection\nentails increased bias; the former is useful in forecasting but less likely to\nyield scientific insight leading to discovery of causal influences, and\nconversely for the latter. This paper presents a scalable algorithm for\nsimultaneous low-bias and low-variance estimation (hence good prediction) with\nsparse selection for high-dimensional VAR models. The method leverages the\nrecently developed Union of Intersections (UoI) algorithmic framework for\nflexible, modular, and scalable feature selection and estimation that allows\ncontrol of false discovery and false omission in feature selection while\nmaintaining low bias and low variance.

The method assembles the full-system network by\nconnecting components, which is achieved simply by associating endogenous-input\nrandom variables for each component with output random variables from other\ncomponents; no other inter-component compatibility conditions are required.

In these models, the velocity\nfield is randomly transported by white-noise vector fields, as well as by its\nown average over realizations of this noise. We call these systems the\nLagrangian averaged stochastic advection by Lie transport (LA SALT) equations.\nThese equations are nonlinear and non-local, in both physical and probability\nspace. Before taking this average, the equations recover the Stochastic\nAdvection by Lie Transport (SALT) fluid equations introduced by Holm (2015).\nRemarkably, the introduction of the non-locality in probability space in the\nform of momentum transported by its own mean velocity gives rise to a closed\nequation for the expectation field which comprises Navier--Stokes equations\nwith Lie--Laplacian \"dissipation\". As such, this form of non-locality provides\na regularization mechanism. The formalism we develop is closely connected to\nthe stochastic Weber velocity framework of Constantin and Iyer (2008) in the\ncase when the noise correlates are taken to be the constant basis vectors in\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$ and, thus, the Lie--Laplacian reduces to the usual Laplacian. We\nextend this class of equations to allow for advected quantities to be present\nand affect the flow through exchange of kinetic and potential energies. The\nstatistics of the solutions for the LA SALT fluid equations are found to be\nchanging dynamically due to an array of intricate correlations among the\nphysical variables. The statistical properties of the LA SALT physical\nvariables propagate as local evolutionary equations which when spatially\nintegrated become dynamical equations for the variances of the fluctuations.\nEssentially, the LA SALT theory is a non-equilibrium stochastic linear response\ntheory for fluctuations in SALT fluids with advected quantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 23:42:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Dec 2019 17:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Thus, scenario reduction\ngets more attentions in recent years. Many scenario reduction methods have been\nproposed to reduce the scenario set in a fast speed. However, the speed of\nscenario reduction is still very slow, in which it takes at least several\nseconds to several minutes to finish the reduction. This limitation of speed\nprevents stochastic programming to be implemented in real-time optimal control\nproblems. In this paper, a fast scenario reduction method based on deep\nlearning is proposed to solve this problem. Inspired by the deep learning based\nimage process, recognition and generation methods, the scenario data are\ntransformed into a 2D image-like data and then to be fed into a deep\nconvolutional neural network (DCNN). The output of the DCNN will be an \"image\"\nof the reduced scenario set. Since images can be processed in a very high speed\nby neural networks, the scenario reduction by neural network can also be very\nfast. The results of the simulation show that the scenario reduction with the\nproposed DCNN method can be completed in very high speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 00:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-02"}

Most existing methods capture\nseen-unseen relation implicitly via semantic embedding or feature generation,\nresulting in inadequate use of relation and some issues remain (e.g. domain\nshift). To tackle these challenges, we propose a Transferable Graph Generation\n(TGG) approach, in which the relation is modeled and utilized explicitly via\ngraph generation. Specifically, our proposed TGG contains two main components:\n(1) Graph generation for relation modeling. An attention-based aggregate\nnetwork and a relation kernel are proposed, which generate instance-level graph\nbased on a class-level prototype graph and visual features. Proximity\ninformation aggregating is guided by a multi-head graph attention mechanism,\nwhere seen and unseen features synthesized by GAN are revised as node\nembeddings. The relation kernel further generates edges with GCN and graph\nkernel method, to capture instance-level topological structure while tackling\ndata imbalance and noise. (2) Relation propagation for relation utilization. A\ndual relation propagation approach is proposed, where relations captured by the\ngenerated graph are separately propagated from the seen and unseen subgraphs.\nThe two propagations learn from each other in a dual learning fashion, which\nperforms as an adaptation way for mitigating domain shift. All components are\njointly optimized with a meta-learning strategy, and our TGG acts as an\nend-to-end framework unifying conventional zero-shot, generalized zero-shot and\nfew-shot learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it consistently\nsurpasses existing methods of the above three fields by a significant margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 01:47:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-02"}

Most\nrecently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) based regularization methods\nare exploited to regularize embedding learning process, which can encourage a\nglobal smoothness of embedding vectors. These methods have very complicated\narchitecture and suffer from the well-recognized non-convergence problem of\nGANs. In this paper, we aim to introduce a more succinct and effective local\nregularization method, namely adversarial training, to network embedding so as\nto achieve model robustness and better generalization performance. Firstly, the\nadversarial training method is applied by defining adversarial perturbations in\nthe embedding space with an adaptive $L_2$ norm constraint that depends on the\nconnectivity pattern of node pairs. Though effective as a regularizer, it\nsuffers from the interpretability issue which may hinder its application in\ncertain real-world scenarios. To improve this strategy, we further propose an\ninterpretable adversarial training method by enforcing the reconstruction of\nthe adversarial examples in the discrete graph domain.

A recent advance\nof end-to-end TTS is due to a key technique called attention mechanisms, and\nall successful methods proposed so far have been based on soft attention\nmechanisms. However, although network structures are becoming increasingly\ncomplex, end-to-end TTS systems with soft attention mechanisms may still fail\nto learn and to predict accurate alignment between the input and output. This\nmay be because the soft attention mechanisms are too flexible. Therefore, we\npropose an approach that has more explicit but natural constraints suitable for\nspeech signals to make alignment learning and prediction of end-to-end TTS\nsystems more robust. The proposed system, with the constrained alignment scheme\nborrowed from segment-to-segment neural transduction (SSNT), directly\ncalculates the joint probability of acoustic features and alignment given an\ninput text. The alignment is designed to be hard and monotonically increase by\nconsidering the speech nature, and it is treated as a latent variable and\nmarginalized during training. During prediction, both the alignment and\nacoustic features can be generated from the probabilistic distributions. The\nadvantages of our approach are that we can simplify many modules for the soft\nattention and that we can train the end-to-end TTS model using a single\nlikelihood function. As far as we know, our approach is the first end-to-end\nTTS without a soft attention mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 05:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-02"}

These types of chromospheric jets are originated by\nthe pressure pulse, which mimics after effects of the localized heating in the\nlower solar atmosphere. These jets may be responsible for the transport of mass\nand energy in the localized upper atmosphere (i.e., corona). The detection of\nthe height-time profiles for the jets, originated by imposing the different\npressure pulses, exhibit the asymmetric near parabolic behaviour. This infers\nthat the upward motion of the jet occurs under the influence of pressure\nperturbation. However, its downward motion is not only governed by the\ngravitational free fall, but also due to the complex plasma motions near its\nbase under the effect of counter propagating pulses. Maximum height and\nlife-time of the jets w.r.t. the strength of the pressure pulse show a linear\nincreasing trend. This suggests that if the extent of the heating and thus\npressure perturbations will be longer then more longer chromospheric jets can\nbe triggered from the same location in the chromosphere. For the certain\namplitude of pressure pulse, the strong magnetic field configuration (B=112\nGauss) leads more longer jet compared to the weaker field (B=56 Gauss). This\nsuggests that the strong magnetic field guides the pressure pulse driven jets\nmore efficiency towards the higher corona. In conclusion, our model mimics the\nproperties and evolution of variety of the cool impulsive jets in the\nchromosphere (e.g., macrospicules, network jets, isolated repeated cool jets,\nconfined \\& small surges etc).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 06:35:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

Graph Convolutional\nNetworks (GCNs) are neural networks that are capable of leveraging the\nstructure of a road network by utilizing information of, e.g., adjacent road\nsegments. While state-of-the-art GCNs target node classification tasks in\nsocial, citation, and biological networks, machine learning tasks in road\nnetworks differ substantially from such tasks. In road networks, prediction\ntasks concern edges representing road segments, and many tasks involve\nregression. In addition, road networks differ substantially from the networks\nassumed in the GCN literature in terms of the attribute information available\nand the network characteristics. Many implicit assumptions of GCNs do therefore\nnot apply.

Recent studies, indeed, showed\nthat users online tend to promote their favored narratives and thus to form\npolarized groups around a common system of beliefs. Confirmation bias helps to\naccount for users decisions about whether to spread content, thus creating\ninformational cascades within identifiable communities. At the same time,\naggregation of favored information within those communities reinforces\nselective exposure and group polarization. Along this path, through a thorough\nquantitative analysis we approach connectivity patterns over 1.2M of Facebook\nusers engaged with two very conflicting narratives: scientific and conspiracy\nnews. Analyzing such data, we quantitatively investigate the effect of two\nmechanisms (namely challenge avoidance and reinforcement seeking) behind\nconfirmation bias, one of the major drivers of human behavior in social media.\nWe find that challenge avoidance mechanism triggers the emergence of two\ndistinct and polarized groups of users (i.e., echo chambers) who also tend to\nbe surrounded by friends having similar systems of beliefs. Through a network\nbased approach, we show how the reinforcement seeking mechanism limits the\ninfluence of neighbors and primarily drives the selection and diffusion of\ncontents even among like-minded users, thus fostering the formation of highly\npolarized sub-clusters within the same echo chamber. Finally, we show that\npolarized users reinforce their preexisting beliefs by leveraging the activity\nof their like-minded neighbors, and this trend grows with the user engagement\nsuggesting how peer influence acts as a support for reinforcement seeking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 08:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

To address these problems, we propose an innovative solution,\nTraceable Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning (THGRL). Unlike prior\ntext-based aspect detection works, THGRL explores latent domain aspect category\nconnections via massive user behavior information on a heterogeneous graph.\nMoreover, an innovative latent variable \"Walker Tracer\" is introduced to\ncharacterize the global semantic/aspect dependencies and capture the\ninformative vertexes on the random walk paths. By using THGRL, we project\ndifferent domains' feature spaces into a common one, while allowing data\ndistributions and output spaces stay differently.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel lip-reading model which captures\nnot only the nuance between words but also styles of different speakers, by a\nmulti-grained spatio-temporal modeling of the speaking process. Specifically,\nwe first extract both frame-level fine-grained features and short-term\nmedium-grained features by the visual front-end, which are then combined to\nobtain discriminative representations for words with similar phonemes. Next, a\nbidirectional ConvLSTM augmented with temporal attention aggregates\nspatio-temporal information in the entire input sequence, which is expected to\nbe able to capture the coarse-gained patterns of each word and robust to\nvarious conditions in speaker identity, lighting conditions, and so on.

To increase the resolution, an initial coarse\nlattice is successively refined close to the target, by adding exactly sampled\nmidpoints, where the probability that they reach the target is non-negligible.\nCompared to a path of $N$ equally spaced points, the algorithm achieves the\nsame numerical accuracy $N_{\\rm eff}$, while sampling only a small fraction of\nall points. Though this induces a statistical error, the latter is bounded for\neach bridge, allowing us to bound the total error rate by a number of our\nchoice, say $P_{\\rm error}^{\\rm tot}=10^{-6}$.

Particularly, defect related energy levels\nintroduced in the plasmonic band gap have not been observed experimentally. In\norder to investigate such a localized mode, we performed electron energy-loss\nspectroscopy (EELS), on a point defect introduced in a plasmonic crystal made\nup of flat cylinders protruding out of a metal film and arranged on a\ntriangular lattice. The energy level of the defect mode was observed to lie\nwithin the full band-gap energy range. This was confirmed by a\nmomentum-resolved EELS measurement of the band gap performed on the same\nplasmonic crystal. Furthermore, we experimentally and theoretically\ninvestigated the emergence of the defect states by starting with a corral of\nflat cylinders protrusions and adding sequentially additional shells of those\nin order to eventually forming a plasmonic band-gap crystal encompassing a\nsingle point defect. It is demonstrated that a defect-like state already forms\nwith a crystal made up of only two shells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 10:45:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

With transdimensional inversion algorithms\nsuch as the reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (rjMCMC), it is possible\nto vary this number during the inversion and to interpret the observations in a\nmore flexible way. Geoscience imaging applications use this behaviour to\nautomatically adjust model resolution to the inhomogeneities of the\ninvestigated system, while keeping the model parameters on an optimal level.\nThe rjMCMC algorithm produces an ensemble as result, a set of model\nrealizations which together represent the posterior probability distribution of\nthe investigated problem. The realizations are evolved via sequential updates\nfrom a randomly chosen initial solution, and converge toward the target\nposterior distribution of the inverse problem.

With convergence assessment techniques, this\npoint in the chain can be identified. Transdimensional MCMC methods produce\nensembles which are not suitable for classic convergence assessment techniques\nbecause of the changes in parameter numbers. To overcome this hurdle, three\nsolutions are introduced to convert model realizations to a common\ndimensionality while maintaining the statistical characteristics of the\nensemble.

This includes the hypervisor\nenabling the sharing of a single hardware platform among multiple tenants. AMD\nSecure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) claims a new level of protection in cloud\nscenarios. AMD SEV encrypts the main memory of virtual machines with\nVM-specific keys, thereby denying the higher-privileged hypervisor access to a\nguest's memory. To enable the cloud customer to verify the correct deployment\nof his virtual machine, SEV additionally introduces a remote attestation\nprotocol.This paper analyzes the firmware components that implement the SEV\nremote attestation protocol on the current AMD Epyc Naples CPU series. We\ndemonstrate that it is possible to extract critical CPU-specific keys that are\nfundamental for the security of the remote attestation protocol.Building on the\nextracted keys, we propose attacks that allow a malicious cloud provider a\ncomplete circumvention of the SEV protection mechanisms. Although the\nunderlying firmware issues were already fixed by AMD, we show that the current\nseries of AMD Epyc CPUs, i.e., the Naples series, does not prevent the\ninstallation of previous firmware versions.

Substrate-induced\nstrain and sublattice symmetry breaking further reduce the symmetry such that\nan out-of-plane orbital magnetization can be generated. Due to the large\nnon-trivial Berry phase of the flat bands, the orbital magnetization of a Bloch\nstate can be as large as tens of Bohr magnetons and therefore a small current\nwould be sufficient to generate a large orbital magnetization.

The choice of a representation fitting an optimization\nproblem can considerably simplify solving the problem. We consider the\nNonlinear Rotation-Invariant Coordinates (NRIC) that represent the nodal\npositions of a discrete triangular surface with fixed combinatorics as a vector\nthat stacks all edge lengths and dihedral angles of the mesh. It is known that\nthis representation associates a unique vector to an equivalence class of nodal\npositions that differ by a rigid body motion. Moreover, integrability\nconditions that ensure the existence of nodal positions that match a given\nvector of edge lengths and dihedral angles have been established. The goal of\nthis paper is to develop the machinery needed to use the NRIC for solving\ngeometric optimization problems. First, we use the integrability conditions to\nderive an implicit description of the space of discrete surfaces as a\nsubmanifold of an Euclidean space and a corresponding description of its\ntangent spaces. Secondly, we reformulate the integrability conditions using\nquaternions and provide explicit formulas for their first and second\nderivatives facilitating the use of Hessians in NRIC-based optimization\nproblems. Lastly, we introduce a fast and robust algorithm that reconstructs\nnodal positions from almost integrable NRIC. We demonstrate the benefits of\nthis approach on a collection of geometric optimization problems. Comparisons\nto alternative approaches indicate that NRIC-based optimization is particularly\neffective for problems involving near-isometric deformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 13:27:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 10:25:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

However, incorporating syntax through latent\nvariables introduces additional complexity in inference, as the models need to\nmarginalize over the latent syntactic structures. To avoid this, models often\nresort to greedy search which only allows them to explore a limited portion of\nthe latent space. In this work, we introduce a new latent variable model,\nLaSyn, that captures the co-dependence between syntax and semantics, while\nallowing for effective and efficient inference over the latent space. LaSyn\ndecouples direct dependence between successive latent variables, which allows\nits decoder to exhaustively search through the latent syntactic choices, while\nkeeping decoding speed proportional to the size of the latent variable\nvocabulary. We implement LaSyn by modifying a transformer-based NMT system and\ndesign a neural expectation maximization algorithm that we regularize with\npart-of-speech information as the latent sequences. Evaluations on four\ndifferent MT tasks show that incorporating target side syntax with LaSyn\nimproves both translation quality, and also provides an opportunity to improve\ndiversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 15:21:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-02"}

We identified 78 clouds toward Orion A by applying Spectral\nClustering for Interstellar Molecular Emission Segmentation (SCIMES) to the\ndata cube of the column density of $^{13}$CO. Well-known subregions such as\nOMC-1, OMC-2/3, OMC-4, OMC-5, NGC 1977, L1641-N, and the dark lane south\nfilament (DLSF) are naturally identified as distinct structures in Orion A.\nThese clouds can also be classified into three groups: the integral-shaped\nfilament, the southern regions of Orion A, and the other filamentary structures\nin the outer parts of Orion A and the DLSF. These groups show differences in\nscaling relations between the physical properties of the clouds. We derived the\nabundance ratio between $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O,\n$X_{^{13}\\mathrm{CO}}/X_{\\mathrm{C}^{18}\\mathrm{O}}$, which ranges from 5.6 to\n17.4 on median over the individual clouds. The significant variation of\n$X_{^{13}\\mathrm{CO}}/X_{\\mathrm{C}^{18}\\mathrm{O}}$ is also seen within a\ncloud in both of the spatial and velocity directions and the ratio tends to be\nhigh at the edge of the cloud. The values of\n$X_{^{13}\\mathrm{CO}}/X_{\\mathrm{C}^{18}\\mathrm{O}}$ decrease from 17 to 10\nwith the median of the column densities of the clouds at the column density of\n$N_{\\mathrm{C^{18}O}} \\gtrsim 1 \\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ or visual extinction\nof $A_V \\gtrsim 3$ mag under the strong far-ultraviolet (FUV) environment of\n$G_0 > 10^{3}$, whereas it is almost independent of the column density in the\nweak FUV radiation field. These results are explained if the selective\nphotodissociation of C$^{18}$O is enhanced under a strong FUV environment and\nit is suppressed in the dense part of the clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 15:47:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Accordingly, we here\nstudy how periodic shifts between different manifestations of social dilemmas\naffect cooperation. We observe a non-trivial interplay between the inherent\nspatiotemporal dynamics that characterizes the spreading of cooperation in a\nparticular social dilemma type and the frequency of payoff changes. In\nparticular, we show that periodic changes between two available games with\nglobal ordering best be fast, while periodic changes between global and local\nordering games best be slow for cooperation to thrive. We also show that the\nfrequency of periodic changes between two local ordering social dilemmas is\nirrelevant, because then the process is fast and simply the average cooperation\nlevel of the two is returned. The structure of the interaction network plays an\nimportant role too in that lattices promote local ordering, whilst random\ngraphs hinder the formation of compact cooperative clusters. Conversely, for\nlocal ordering the regular structure of the interaction network is only\nmarginally relevant as role-separating checkerboard patterns do not rely on\nlong-range order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 15:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-02"}

This work focuses on\nhow the disk formation is affected by turbulence and ambipolar diffusion (AD),\nboth separately and in combination, with an emphasis on the protostellar mass\naccretion phase of star formation. We find that a relatively strong, sonic\nturbulence on the core scale strongly warps but does not completely disrupt the\nwell-known magnetically-induced flattened pseudodisk that dominates the inner\nprotostellar accretion flow in the laminar case, in agreement with previous\nwork. The turbulence enables the formation of a relatively large disk at early\ntimes with or without ambipolar diffusion, but such a disk remains strongly\nmagnetized and does not persist to the end of our simulation unless a\nrelatively strong ambipolar diffusion is also present. The AD-enabled disks in\nlaminar simulations tend to fragment gravitationally. The disk fragmentation is\nsuppressed by initial turbulence. The ambipolar diffusion facilitates the disk\nformation and survival by reducing the field strength in the circumstellar\nregion through magnetic flux redistribution and by making the field lines there\nless pinched azimuthally, especially at late times. We conclude that turbulence\nand ambipolar diffusion complement each other in promoting disk formation. The\ndisks formed in our simulations inherit a rather strong magnetic field from its\nparental core, with a typical plasma-$\\beta$ of order a few tens or smaller,\nwhich is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than the values commonly adopted in MHD\nsimulations of protoplanetary disks. To resolve this potential tension,\nlonger-term simulations of disk formation and evolution with increasingly more\nrealistic physics are needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 15:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-02"}

The fate behaviour of these\ncells is reflected in the time evolution their progeny, termed clones, which\nserve as a key experimental observable. In adult tissues, where cell dynamics\nis constrained by the condition of homeostasis, clonal tracing studies based on\ntransgenic animal models have advanced our understanding of cell fate behaviour\nand its dysregulation in disease. But what can be learned from clonal dynamics\nin development, where the spatial cohesiveness of clones is impaired by tissue\ndeformations during tissue growth? Drawing on the results of clonal tracing\nstudies, we show that, despite the complexity of organ development, clonal\ndynamics may converge to a critical state characterized by universal scaling\nbehaviour of clone sizes. By mapping clonal dynamics onto a generalization of\nthe classical theory of aerosols, we elucidate the origin and range of scaling\nbehaviours and show how the identification of universal scaling dependences may\nallow lineage-specific information to be distilled from experiments.

In modern mathematics, however, probability theory\nmeans nothing other than measure theory, and the operational characterization\nof the notion of probability is not established yet. In this paper, based on\nthe toolkit of algorithmic randomness we present an operational\ncharacterization of the notion of probability, called an ensemble, for general\ndiscrete probability spaces whose sample space is countably infinite.\nAlgorithmic randomness, also known as algorithmic information theory, is a\nfield of mathematics which enables us to consider the randomness of an\nindividual infinite sequence. We use an extension of Martin-Loef randomness\nwith respect to a generalized Bernoulli measure over the Baire space, in order\nto present the operational characterization. In our former work [K. Tadaki,\narXiv:1611.06201], we developed an operational characterization of the notion\nof probability for an arbitrary finite probability space, i.e., a probability\nspace whose sample space is a finite set. We then gave a natural operational\ncharacterization of the notion of conditional probability in terms of ensemble\nfor a finite probability space, and gave equivalent characterizations of the\nnotion of independence between two events based on it. Furthermore, we gave\nequivalent characterizations of the notion of independence of an arbitrary\nnumber of events/random variables in terms of ensembles for finite probability\nspaces. In particular, we showed that the independence between events/random\nvariables is equivalent to the independence in the sense of van Lambalgen's\nTheorem, in the case where the underlying finite probability space is\ncomputable.
