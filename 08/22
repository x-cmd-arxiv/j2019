The two terminals, called the observer and the decision\nmaker, each has access to $n$ independent and identically distributed samples,\ndenoted by $\\mathbf{U}$ and $\\mathbf{V}$, respectively. The observer\ncommunicates to the decision maker over a discrete memoryless channel, and the\ndecision maker performs a binary hypothesis test on the joint probability\ndistribution of $(\\mathbf{U},\\mathbf{V})$ based on $\\mathbf{V}$ and the noisy\ninformation received from the observer. The trade-off between the exponents of\nthe type I and type II error probabilities is investigated. Two inner bounds\nare obtained, one using a separation-based scheme that involves type-based\ncompression and unequal error-protection channel coding, and the other using a\njoint scheme that incorporates type-based hybrid coding. The separation-based\nscheme is shown to recover the inner bound obtained by Han and Kobayashi for\nthe special case of a rate-limited noiseless channel, and also the one obtained\nby the authors previously for a corner point of the trade-off. Finally, we show\nvia an example that the joint scheme achieves a strictly tighter bound than the\nseparation-based scheme for some points of the error-exponents trade-off.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 16:21:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 May 2020 02:27:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 02:02:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2023 01:57:52 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2023 09:25:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-07"}

Selection is\nclassified as stabilizing when species with intermediate trait values gain the\nhighest reproductive success, whereas selection is considered directional when\nfitness is highest for species with extreme trait values. Previous studies have\ninvestigated the effects of different selection types on trait distribution,\nbut the effects of selection on species diversity have remained unclear. Here,\nwe propose a framework for inferring the type and strength of selection by\nstudying species diversity and trait distribution together against null\nexpectations. We use a simulation model to confirm our prediction that\ndirectional selection should lead to lower species diversity than stabilizing\nselection despite a similar effect on trait community-weighted variance. We\napply the framework to a mesocosm system of annual plants to test whether\ndifferences in species diversity between two habitats that vary in productivity\nare related to differences in selection on seed mass. We show that, in both\nhabitats, species diversity was lower than the null expectation, but that\nspecies diversity was lower in the more productive habitat. We attribute this\ndifference to strong directional selection for large-seeded species in the\nproductive habitat as indicated by trait community-weighted-mean being higher\nand community-weighted variance being lower than the null expectations. In the\nless productive habitat, we found that community-weighted variance was higher\nthan expected by chance, suggesting that seed mass could be a driver of niche\npartitioning under such conditions.

We\nobserve that a modern PCM bank is implemented as a collection of partitions\nthat operate mostly independently while sharing a few global peripheral\nstructures, which include the sense amplifiers (to read) and the write drivers\n(to write). Based on this observation, we propose PALP, a new mechanism that\nenables partition-level parallelism within each PCM bank, and exploits such\nparallelism by using the memory controller's access scheduling decisions. PALP\nconsists of three new contributions. First, we introduce new PCM commands to\nenable parallelism in a bank's partitions in order to resolve the read-write\nbank conflicts, with minimal changes needed to PCM logic and its interface.\nSecond, we propose simple circuit modifications that introduce a new operating\nmode for the write drivers, in addition to their default mode of serving write\nrequests. When configured in this new mode, the write drivers can resolve the\nread-read bank conflicts, working jointly with the sense amplifiers. Finally,\nwe propose a new access scheduling mechanism in PCM that improves performance\nby prioritizing those requests that exploit partition-level parallelism over\nother requests, including the long outstanding ones. While doing so, the memory\ncontroller also guarantees starvation-freedom and the PCM's\nrunning-average-power-limit (RAPL).

Thereby we\nreduce the number of unknowns on each step from $n$ to $O(1)$, where $n$ is the\ndimension of the ODE system. We call this type of methods Minimal Residual\nMultistep (MRMS) methods. In the case of linear non-autonomous problem, besides\nthe evaluations of the right-hand side of ODE, the resulting numerical scheme\nadditionally requires one solution of a linear least-squares problem with a\nthin matrix per step.

We performed photometric\nand slit-less observations at several epochs in order to reveal the variable\nobjects. Significant variability of EW(Ha) was found in 90 out of 127 examined\nstars. From all epochs of observations, 32 objects were classified as CTT and\n69 as WTT objects. The fraction of the variables in these samples is about 60%.\nWe also identified 20 stellar objects, which showed not only a significant\nvariability of the equivalent width, but which also change their apparent\nevolutionary stage.\n  The analysis of data obtained over a wide wavelength range (from X-ray to\nmid-infrared) has shown that Ha activity and the measure of its variability are\nin good agreement with the activity of stellar objects measured with its other\nparameters, such as X-ray radiation and the mass accretion rate. The EW(Ha)\ndiffers not only between objects at different evolutionary stages, but also\nbetween variable and non-variable objects. The variables in the CTT and WTT\nsamples are more active than non-variables although they have almost the same\nevolutionary age. Another distinct difference between these variables and\nnon-variables is their average masses. The variables from both CTT and WTT\nsamples are noticeably more massive than non-variables. Our data confirm the\nassumption made for other star formation regions, that the decay of accretion\nactivity occurs more slowly for more massive CTT objects. Apparently, a similar\ntrend is also present in WTT objects, which are at a later stage of evolution.\nThe variability of the stellar objects, which change their evolutionary\nclasses, at least in a fraction of them, is due to the fact that they are close\nbinaries, which affects and modulates their Ha emission activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 17:03:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Nov 2019 17:39:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-19"}

When humans convert the sentiment attribute of a\nsentence, a simple but effective approach is to only replace the original\nsentimental tokens in the sentence with target sentimental expressions, instead\nof building a new sentence from scratch.

We analyze in detail the limit of\ninfinite on-site Hilbert space dimension in which the statistical mechanics\nmodel maps onto percolation. In particular, we compute the exact value of the\nuniversal coefficient of the logarithm of subsystem size in the $n$th R\\'enyi\nentropies for $n \\geq 1$ in this limit using relatively recent results for\nconformal field theory describing the critical theory of 2D percolation, and we\ndiscuss how to access the generic transition at finite on-site Hilbert space\ndimension from this limit, which is in a universality class different from 2D\npercolation. We also comment on the relation to the entanglement transition in\nRandom Tensor Networks, studied previously in Ref. 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

While rare in the field, these binary systems can be formed dynamically\nat much higher rates in globular clusters. Subsequent binary hardening both\nincreases their interaction rate and ejects them from their parent globular\nclusters prior to mass transfer contact.

This paper considers\nthe problem of primary frequency regulation with ancillary service from on-off\nloads in power networks and establishes conditions that lead to convergence\nguarantees and an appropriate power allocation within the network.

These behaviors are composed of\nsimple collective motions of particles which move with the same frequency and\nphase, thus encapsulating many-body effects into simple dynamic motions. In\nregimes such as the unitary regime for ultracold Fermi gases, a single\ncollective mode can dominate, leading to simple behavior as seen in\nsuperfluidity. I investigate the evolution of collective motion as a function\nof N for five types of normal modes obtained from an L=0 group theoretic\nsolution of a general Hamiltonian for confined, identical particles. I show\nusing simple analytic forms that the collective behavior of few-body systems,\nwith the well known motions of molecular equivalents such as ammonia and\nmethane, evolves smoothly to the collective motions expected for large N\nensembles. The transition occurs at quite low values of N. I study a\nHamiltonian known to support collective behavior, the Hamiltonian for Fermi\ngases in the unitary regime. I analyze the evolution of both frequencies and\nthe coefficients that mix the radial and angular coordinates which both depend\non interparticle interactions. This analysis reveals two phenomena that could\ncontribute to the viability of collective behavior.

Understanding their behavior is of broad interest; from the control of\nepidemics to understanding brain dynamics. While in some cases there exists a\nclear separation of time scales between the propagation of a single spreading\ncascade and the initiation of the next -- such that spreading can be modelled\nas directed percolation or a branching process -- there are also processes for\nwhich this is not the case, such as zoonotic diseases or spiking cascades in\nneural networks. For a large class of relevant network topologies, we show here\nthat in such a scenario the nature of the overall spreading fundamentally\nchanges. This change manifests itself in a transition between different\nuniversality classes of critical spreading, which determines the onset and the\nproperties of an avalanche turning epidemic or neural activity turning\nepileptic, for example. We present analytical results in the mean-field limit\ngiving the critical line along which scale-free spreading behaviour can be\nobserved. The two limits of this critical line correspond to the universality\nclasses of directed and undirected percolation, respectively. Outside these two\nlimits, this duality manifests itself in the appearance of critical exponents\nfrom the universality classes of both directed and undirected percolation. We\nfind that the transition between these exponents is governed by a competition\nbetween merging and propagation of activity, and identify an appropriate\nscaling relationship for the transition point. Finally, we show that commonly\nused measures, such as the branching ratio and dynamic susceptibility, fail to\nestablish criticality in the absence of time-scale separation calling for a\nreanalysis of criticality in the brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 01:27:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 19:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

Although AL has been widely\nstudied for alleviating label sparsity issues with the conventional non-related\ndata, how to make it effective over attributed graphs remains an open research\nquestion. Existing AL algorithms on graphs attempt to reuse the classic AL\nquery strategies designed for non-related data. However, they suffer from two\nmajor limitations. First, different AL query strategies calculated in distinct\nscoring spaces are often naively combined to determine which nodes to be\nlabelled. Second, the AL query engine and the learning of the classifier are\ntreated as two separating processes, resulting in unsatisfactory performance.\nIn this paper, we propose a SEmi-supervised Adversarial active Learning (SEAL)\nframework on attributed graphs, which fully leverages the representation power\nof deep neural networks and devises a novel AL query strategy in an adversarial\nway.

The divergence score,\ngenerated by the discriminator in a unified latent space, serves as the\ninformativeness measure to actively select the most informative node to be\nlabelled by an oracle. The two adversarial components form a closed loop to\nmutually and simultaneously reinforce each other towards enhancing the active\nlearning performance.

In this paper,\nwe examine the influence of surface energy on the hardness of materials under\nspherical indentation. To evaluate the ability of materials to resist\nindentation, a yield hardness is defined here as the contact pressure at the\ninception of material yield. It is found that this defined hardness is an\nintrinsic material property depending only on the yield strength and Poisson\nratio in conventional continuum mechanics. Then, the impact of surface energy\non the yield hardness is analyzed through finite element simulations. By using\nthe dimensional analysis, the dependences of the yield hardness and critical\nindent depth at yield initiation on surface energy have been achieved. When the\nyield strength is comparable to the ratio of surface energy density to indenter\nradius, surface energy will alter the yield hardness and the critical indent\ndepth. As the size of indenter decreases to nanoscale, both the yield hardness\nand the indent depth will increase significantly. This study provides a\npossible clarification to the size dependence of hardness and a potential\napproach to measure the yield strength and surface energy of solids through\nnanosized indentations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 02:24:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

To improve its energy performance, it is important to fairly\nbenchmark its energy performance and provide the evaluation feedback to users.\nHowever, this task has not been well tackled in the residential sector. In this\npaper, we propose a data-driven approach to fairly benchmark the AC energy\nperformance of residential rooms. First, regression model is built for each\nbenchmarked room so that its power consumption can be predicted given different\nweather conditions and AC settings. Then, all the rooms are clustered based on\ntheir areas and usual AC temperature set points. Lastly, within each cluster,\nrooms are benchmarked based on their predicted power consumption under uniform\nweather conditions and AC settings. A real-world case study was conducted with\ndata collected from 44 residential rooms. Results show that the constructed\nregression models have an average prediction accuracy of 85.1% in\ncross-validation tests, and support vector regression with Gaussian kernel is\nthe overall most suitable model structure for building the regression model. In\nthe clustering step, 44 rooms are successfully clustered into seven clusters.\nBy comparing the benchmarking scores generated by the proposed approach with\ntwo sets of scores computed from historical power consumption data, we\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach is able to eliminate the influences of\nroom areas, weather conditions, and AC settings on the benchmarking results.\nTherefore, the proposed benchmarking approach is valid and fair. As a\nby-product, the approach is also shown to be useful to investigate how room\nareas, weather conditions, and AC settings affect the AC power consumption of\nrooms in real life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 02:39:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 08:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

Research efforts dedicated to\nrepresentation learning, especially representation learning using deep\nlearning, has shown us ways to automatically learn relevant features from vast\namounts of potentially noisy, raw data.

We propose a novel efficient\nalgorithm, motif2vec that learns node representations or embeddings for\nheterogeneous networks. Specifically, we leverage higher-order, recurring, and\nstatistically significant network connectivity patterns in the form of motifs\nto transform the original graph to motif graph(s), conduct biased random walk\nto efficiently explore higher order neighborhoods, and then employ\nheterogeneous skip-gram model to generate the embeddings. Unlike previous\nefforts that uses different graph meta-structures to guide the random walk, we\nuse graph motifs to transform the original network and preserve the\nheterogeneity. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on multiple real-world\nnetworks from diverse domains and against existing state-of-the-art methods on\nmulti-class node classification and link prediction tasks, and demonstrate its\nconsistent superiority over prior work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 07:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-23"}

ITSs produce better-informed decisions using\nreal-time data gathered from connected vehicles. In ITSs, Vehicular Ad hoc\nNetwork (VANET) is a communication infrastructure responsible for exchanging\ndata between vehicles and Traffic Management Centers (TMC). VANET performance\n(packet delay and drop rate) can affect the performance of ITS applications.\nFurthermore, the distribution of communicating vehicles affects the VANET\nperformance. So, capturing this mutual impact between communication and\ntransportation is crucial to understanding the behavior of ITS applications.\nThus, this paper focuses on studying the mutual impact of VANET communication\nand mobility in city-level ITSs. We first introduce a new scalable and\ncomputationally fast framework for modeling large-scale ITSs including\ncommunication and mobility. In the proposed framework, we develop and validate\na new mathematical model for the IEEE 802.11p MAC protocol which can capture\nthe behavior of medium access and queuing process. This MAC model is then\nintegrated within a microscopic traffic simulator to accurately simulate\nvehicle mobility. This integrated framework can accurately capture the\nmobility, communication, and the spatiotemporal impacts in large-scale ITSs.\nSecondly, the proposed framework is used to study the impact of communication\non eco-routing navigation performance in a real large-scale network with real\ncalibrated vehicular traffic. The paper demonstrates that communication\nperformance can significantly degrade the performance of the dynamic\neco-routing navigation when the traffic density is high. It also shows that the\nfuel consumption can be increased due to lack of communication reliability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 07:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-23"}

Here we demonstrate a conceptually new qubit implementation in a\ncarbon nanotube that achieves these requirements. In contrast to the prevailing\nsemiconducting qubits that use electronic states in double quantum dots, our\nqubit utilizes the natural electronic wavefunctions in a single quantum dot.\nUsing an ultraclean nanotube we construct a qubit from two wavefunctions with\nsignificantly different magnetic moments and spatial charge distributions,\nmaking it sensitive to both magnetic and electric fields. We use an array of\ngates to directly image these wavefunctions and demonstrate their localized\nmoments. Owing to their different spatial structure, these wavefunctions also\nshow radically different transport properties, giving us a simple\ntransport-based qubit readout mechanism. Due to its narrow coherence-limited\ntransition, the qubit demonstrates significantly better electric field\ndetection sensitivity than a single electron transistor. Moreover, with the\nsame qubit we demonstrate simultaneous probing of magnetic fields with DC\nsensitivity comparable to that of NV centers.

Kontsevich\nintroduced a universal version of the deformation theory for the Schouten\nalgebra of polyvector fields on affine manifolds. This universal deformation\ncomplex takes the form of a differential graded Lie algebra of graphs, denoted\n$\\mathsf{fGC}_2$, together with an injective morphism towards the\nChevalley-Eilenberg complex associated with the Schouten algebra. The latter\nmorphism is given by explicit local formulas making implicit use of the\nsupergeometric interpretation of the Schouten algebra as the algebra of\nfunctions on a graded symplectic manifold of degree $1$. The ambition of the\npresent work is to generalise Kontsevich's construction to graded symplectic\nmanifolds of arbitrary degree $n\\geq1$.

We focus\non depinning fronts involving stripes that are orientated either parallel,\noblique and perpendicular to the front interface, and almost planar depinning\nfronts. We show that invading parallel depinning fronts select both a far-field\nwavenumber and a propagation wavespeed whereas retreating parallel depinning\nfronts come in families where the wavespeed is a function of the far-field\nwavenumber. Employing a far-field core decomposition, we propose a boundary\nvalue problem for the invading depinning fronts which we numerically solve and\nuse path-following routines to trace out bifurcation diagrams.

In particular, multiple excitons strongly confined in just one\ndimension are free to re-arrange in the lateral plane, reducing the probability\nfor multi-body collisions. Thus, while simultaneous multiple photon emission is\ntypically quenched in quantum dots, in nanoplatelets its probability can be\ntuned according to size and shape. Here, we focus on analyzing multi-exciton\ndynamics in individual CdSe/CdS nanoplatelets of various sizes through the\nmeasurement of second-, third-, and fourth-order photon correlations.

Although existing CNN-based temporal frameworks attempt to\naddress the sensitivity and drift problems by concurrently processing all input\nframes in the sequence, the existing state-of-the-art CNN-based framework is\nlimited to 3d pose estimation of a single frame from a sequential input. In\nthis paper, we propose a deep learning-based framework that utilizes matrix\nfactorization for sequential 3d human poses estimation.

Using a multi-messenger approach, it is\ntherefore possible to constrain the proton acceleration taking place in the\nsolar flares, including the spectral index of the accelerated flux and its\nshape. We present the results of the first search for GeV neutrinos emitted\nduring solar flares carried out with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. We\npresent a new approach which allows us to strongly lower the energy threshold\nof IceCube, originally designed to detect 10 GeV - PeV neutrinos. We compare\nthe results with theoretical estimates of the corresponding flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 10:45:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-23"}

There are two types of customers that differ in\ntheir beliefs regarding the service time distribution.

Some methods solve this problem by using segmentation into superpixels\nwhile others downscale the image through the network and rescale it back to its\noriginal size. The objective of this paper is to show that saliency\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN) can be improved by using a Green's function\nconvolution (GFC) to extrapolate edges features into salient regions. The GFC\nacts as a gradient integrator, allowing to produce saliency features by filling\nthin edges directly inside the CNN. Hence, we propose the gradient integration\nand sum (GIS) layer that combines the edges features with the saliency\nfeatures. Using the HED and DSS architecture, we demonstrated that adding a GIS\nlayer near the network's output allows to reduce the sensitivity to the\nparameter initialization, to reduce the overfitting and to improve the\nrepeatability of the training. By simply adding a GIS layer to the\nstate-of-the-art DSS model, there is an absolute increase of 1.6% for the\nF-measure on the DUT-OMRON dataset, with only 10ms of additional computation\ntime. The GIS layer further allows the network to perform significantly better\nin the case of highly noisy images or low-brightness images. In fact, we\nobserved an F-measure improvement of 5.2% when noise was added to the dataset\nand 2.8% when the brightness was reduced. Since the GIS layer is model\nagnostic, it can be implemented into different fully convolutional networks. A\nmajor contribution of the current work is the first implementation of Green's\nfunction convolution inside a neural network, which allows the network to\noperate in the feature domain and in the gradient domain at the same time, thus\nimproving the regional representation via edge filling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 12:14:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 04:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

However, these methods are faced\nwith several obvious limitations. Most of these models are extremely time\nconsuming when learning the large-scale FCMs with hundreds of nodes.\nFurthermore, the FCMs learned by those algorithms lack robustness when the\nexperimental data contain noise. In addition, reasonable distribution of the\nweights is rarely considered in these algorithms, which could result in the\nreduction of the performance of the resulting FCM. In this article, a\nstraightforward, rapid, and robust learning method is proposed to learn FCMs\nfrom noisy data, especially, to learn large-scale FCMs. The crux of the\nproposed algorithm is to equivalently transform the learning problem of FCMs to\na classic-constrained convex optimization problem in which the least-squares\nterm ensures the robustness of the well-learned FCM and the maximum entropy\nterm regularizes the distribution of the weights of the well-learned FCM. A\nseries of experiments covering two frequently used activation functions (the\nsigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions) are performed on both synthetic\ndatasets with noise and real-world datasets.

Since tomography is significantly nonlinear, Monte Carlo\nsampling methods are often used for this purpose, but they are generally\ncomputationally intractable for large datasets and high-dimensional parameter\nspaces. To extend uncertainty analysis to larger systems we use variational\ninference methods to conduct seismic tomography. In contrast to Monte Carlo\nsampling, variational methods solve the Bayesian inference problem as an\noptimization problem, yet still provide probabilistic results. In this study,\nwe applied two variational methods, automatic differential variational\ninference (ADVI) and Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD), to 2D seismic\ntomography problems using both synthetic and real data and we compare the\nresults to those from two different Monte Carlo sampling methods.

In\naddition, admissibility of an impulse control policy requires that the random\ntimes of the interventions be stopping times with respect to different\nfiltrations arising from the different component coordinate processes. When the\nunderlying Markov process has {\\em continuous}\\/ paths, however, a simpler\nmodel can be developed which takes the single path space as its probability\nspace and uses the natural filtration with respect to which the intervention\ntimes must be stopping times. Moreover, this model construction allows for\nimpulse control with random effects whereby the decision maker selects a\ndistribution of the new state. This paper gives the construction of the\nprobability measure on the path space for an admissible intervention policy\nsubject to a randomized impulse mechanism. It also identifies a class of\nimpulse policies under which the resulting controlled process is Markov and a\nfurther subclass which results in a Markov family. In addition, a class of\npolices is defined for which the paths between interventions are independent\nand again a further subclass for which the cycles following the initial cycle\nare identically distributed. A benefit of this smaller subclass of policies is\nthat one is allowed to use classical renewal arguments to analyze long-term\naverage control problems. The decision to use an $(s,S)$ ordering policy in\ninventory management provides an example of an impulse policy for which the\nprocess is Markov and has i.i.d.~cycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 13:24:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 16:54:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 16:39:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 14:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-29"}

A\nkey example is bacterial degradation of marine snow responsible for carbon\nexport from the upper ocean in the biological pump. The ecological interaction\nbetween bacteria and sinking particles is regulated by their encounter rate,\nwhich is therefore important to predict accurately in models of\nbacteria-particle interactions. Models available to date cover the diffusive\nencounter regime, valid for sinking particles larger than the typical run\nlength of a bacterium. The majority of sinking particles, however, are small,\nand the encounter process is then ballistic rather than diffusive. In the\nballistic regime, the shear generated by the particle's motion can be important\nin reorienting bacteria and thus determining the encounter rate, yet the effect\nof shear is not captured in current encounter rate models. Here, we combine\nanalytical and numerical calculations to quantify the encounter rate between\nsinking particles and non-motile or motile microorganisms in the ballistic\nregime, explicitly accounting for the hydrodynamic shear created by the\nparticle and its coupling with microorganism shape. We complement results with\nselected experiments on non-motile diatoms. We find that the shape-shear\ncoupling has a considerable effect on the encounter rate and encounter location\nthrough the mechanisms of hydrodynamic focusing and screening, whereby\nelongated microorganisms preferentially orient normally to the particle surface\ndownstream of the particle (focusing) and tangentially to the particle surface\nupstream of the particle (screening). We study these mechanisms as a function\nof the key dimensionless parameters: the ratio of particle sinking speed to\nmicroorganism swimming speed, the ratio of particle radius to microorganism\nlength, and the microorganism's aspect ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 13:44:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-23"}

The analysis is performed for different\ncapillary numbers, volume fraction and viscosity ratio under the assumption of\nnegligible inertia and zero buoyancy force. The effective viscosity of the\nsystem increases for low values of the volume fraction and decreases for higher\nvalues, with a maximum for about 20 % concentration of the disperse phase. When\nthe dispersed fluid has lower viscosity, the normalised effective viscosity\nbecomes smaller than 1 for high enough volume fractions. To single out the\neffect of droplet coalescence on the rheology of the emulsion we introduce an\nEulerian force which prevents merging, effectively modelling the presence of\nsurfactants in the system. When the coalescence is inhibited the effective\nviscosity is always greater than 1 and the curvature of the function\nrepresenting the emulsion effective viscosity vs. the volume fraction becomes\npositive, resembling the behaviour of suspensions of deformable particles. The\nreduction of the effective viscosity in the presence of coalescence is\nassociated to the reduction of the total surface of the disperse phase when the\ndroplets merge, which leads to a reduction of the interface tension\ncontribution to the total shear stress. The probability density function of the\nflow topology parameter shows that the flow is mostly a shear flow in the\nmatrix phase, with regions of extensional flow when the coalescence is\nprohibited. The flow in the disperse phase, instead, always shows rotational\ncomponents. The first normal stress difference is positive whereas the second\nnormal difference is negative, with their ratio being constant with the volume\nfraction.

This has been focus of\ninterest recently, and several efforts have been made to explain relativistic\neffects theoretically, thereby testing the full theory. However, the results at\nnonlinear level from previous works are in disagreement. We present a new and\nindependent approach to computing the relativistic galaxy number counts to\nsecond order in cosmological perturbation theory. We derive analytical\nexpressions for the full second order relativistic observed redshift, for the\nangular diameter distance and for the volume spanned by a survey. Finally, we\ncompare our results with previous works which compute the general\ndistance-redshift relation, finding that our result is in agreement at linear\norder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 14:19:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2019 07:56:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 11:12:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 11:43:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-11"}

These\nalgorithms include metric learning, clustering, and dimension reduction. As\nreal data sets are noisy, distances often fail to satisfy a metric. For this\nreason, Gilbert and Jain and Fan et al. introduced the closely related sparse\nmetric repair and metric violation distance problems. The goal of these\nproblems is to repair as few distances as possible to ensure they satisfy a\nmetric. Three variants were considered, one admitting a polynomial time\nalgorithm. The other variants were shown to be APX-hard, and an\n$O(OPT^{1/3})$-approximation was given, where $OPT$ is the optimal solution\nsize.\n  In this paper, we generalize these problems to no longer consider all\ndistances between the data points. That is, we consider a weighted graph $G$\nwith corrupted weights $w$, and our goal is to find the smallest number of\nweight modifications so that the resulting weighted graph distances satisfy a\nmetric. This is a natural generalization and is more flexible as it takes into\naccount different relationships among the data points.

The known correlation between\nbar semi-major-axis $a$ and galaxy stellar mass (or luminosity) is actually\n*bimodal*: for $\\log M_{\\star} < 10.1$, bar size is almost independent of\nstellar mass ($a \\propto M_{\\star}^{0.1}$), while it is a strong function for\nhigher masses ($a \\propto M_{\\star}^{0.6}$).

The\ntraditional dependence of bar size on Hubble type (longer bars in early-type\ndiscs) can be explained as a side-effect of stellar-mass--Hubble-type\ncorrelations. Finally, I show that galaxy size ($r_{e}$ or $h$) can be modeled\nas a function of stellar mass and both bar presence and bar size: barred\ngalaxies tend to be more extended than unbarred galaxies of the same mass, with\nlarger bars correlated with larger sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 2019 10:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

The area of\nrisk-expected return space where the density forecasts are accurate, where\nex-post performance matches ex-ante estimates, is termed the consistency\nregion. Under the 'laboratory' conditions of a simulated multivariate normal\ndata set, we compute the consistency region and the estimated ex-post frontier.\nOver different sample sizes used for estimation, the behaviour of the\nconsistency region is shown to be both intuitively reasonable and to enclose\nthe estimated ex-post frontier. Using actual data from the constituents of the\nUS Dow Jones 30 index, we show that the size of the consistency region is time\ndependent and, in volatile conditions, may disappear. Using our development of\nthe Berkowitz statistic, we demonstrate the superior performance of an\ninvestment strategy based on consistent rather than efficient portfolios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:15:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2020 11:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

An interpolation scheme is needed to evaluate the\nPDFs at the traced-back locations.

On the Mott insulating side where\nall doublons and holons bond in real space into excitonic pairs leading to the\ncharge gap, the theory simplifies considerably to leading order in\n$1/\\sqrt{z}$, and becomes exact on the infinite-$z$ Bethe lattice. An\nasymptotic solution is obtained for a continuous Mott transition associated\nwith the closing of the charge gap at a critical value of the Hubbard $U_c$ and\nthe corresponding doublon density $n_d^c$, hopping $\\chi_d^c$ and doublon-holon\npairing $\\Delta_d^c$ amplitudes.

In the absence of magnetic order, the Mott\ninsulator is a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid with nonzero intersite spinon hopping\nthat survives the large-$z$ limit and lifts the $2^N$-fold degeneracy of the\nlocal moments. We show that the spinons are coupled to the doublons/holons by a\ndissipative compact $U(1)$ gauge field in the deconfined phase, realizing the\nspin-charge separated gapless spin liquid Mott insulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 06:44:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

Traditional encoding models, which focus on feature\nextraction and mapping, consider the brain as an input-output mapper without\ninner states. In this work, inspired by the fact that human brain acts like a\nstate machine, we proposed a novel encoding framework that combines information\nfrom both the external world and the inner state to predict brain activity. The\nframework comprises two parts: forward encoding model that deals with visual\nstimuli and inner state model that captures influence from intrinsic\nconnections in the brain. The forward model can be any traditional encoding\nmodel, making the framework flexible. The inner state model is a linear model\nto utilize information in the prediction residuals of the forward model. The\nproposed encoding framework can achieve much better performance on natural\nimage identification from fMRI response than forwardonly models.

Research has shown that an infants\nprevious pain experiences lead to an increased, and likely abnormal, response\nto subsequent painful stimuli. We are working to improve neonatal pain\ndetection through automated devices that continuously monitor an infant. The\ncurrent study outlines some of the initial steps we have taken to evaluate Near\nInfrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) as a technology to detect neonatal pain. Our\nfindings may provide neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) practitioners with the\ndata necessary to monitor and perhaps better manage an abnormal pain response.\nMethods: A prospective pilot study was conducted to evaluate nociceptive evoked\ncortical activity in preterm infants. NIRS data were recorded for approximately\n10 minutes prior to an acute painful procedure and for approximately 10 minutes\nafter the procedure. Individual data collection events were performed at a\nweekly maximum frequency. Eligible infants included those admitted to the Tampa\nGeneral Hospital (TGH) NICU with a birth gestational age of less than 37 weeks.\nResults: A total of 15 infants were enrolled and 25 individual studies were\ncompleted.

An acute painful procedure is\ntypically followed by a negative deflection in NIRS readings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 03:26:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

In this context, Distribution Network\nOperators (DNOs) face a significant knowledge gap about how to implement\ncurtailment rules that achieve desired operational objectives, but at the same\ntime minimise disruption and economic losses for renewable generators. In this\nwork, we study the properties of several curtailment rules widely used in UK\nrenewable energy projects, and their effect on the viability of renewable\ngeneration investment. Moreover, we propose a new curtailment rule which\nguarantees fair allocation of curtailment amongst all generators with minimal\ndisruption. Another key knowledge gap faced by DNOs is how to incentivise\nprivate network upgrades, especially in settings where several generators can\nuse the same line against the payment of a transmission fee. In this work, we\nprovide a solution to this problem by using tools from algorithmic game theory.\nSpecifically, this setting can be modelled as a Stackelberg game between the\nprivate transmission line investor and local renewable generators, who are\nrequired to pay a transmission fee to access the line. We provide a method for\ncomputing the empirical equilibrium of this game, using a model that captures\nthe stochastic nature of renewable energy generation and demand.

Whereas currently such levels of small biomolecules are usually\nnot detected online due to practical constraints (sampling-analysis-processing\nof data), reliable online detection could significantly decrease analysis\ncosts. Further, it would allow to perform online quality control of the\nbioreactors and allow to e.g. detect deviating values at an early stage. Hence,\none can react much faster tackling certain problems which will further improve\nthe quality of each experiment. Using machine learning algorithms to process\nthe sensor signals, the results from testing in a so-called artificial gut\nsetup are described in this technical report.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 03:18:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-26"}
