The signal from each\nPMT is digitized individually, providing directional information for the\nincident photons. Together, the 24 PMTs provide an effective photosensitive\narea more than twice than that of the current IceCube optical module. The main\nmDOM design challenges arise from the constraints on the module size and power\nneeded for the 24-channel high-voltage and readout systems.

This non-monotonic behavior is in sharp contrast with the\nwell-studied monotonic $H$-dependency of the shear stress in conventional\nferrofluids, where the shear stress increases with $H$ until it reaches a\nsaturation value. We relate the origin of this non-monotonicity to the\ncompeting effects of particle alignment along the shear-induced direction, on\nthe one hand, and the magnetic field direction, on the other hand. To isolate\nthe role of these competing effects, we consider a two-component mixture\ncomposed of particles with effectively identical steric interactions, where the\norientations of a small fraction, i.e.\\ the magnetic ones, are coupled to the\nexternal magnetic field. By increasing $H$ from zero, the orientations of the\nmagnetic particles show a Fr\\'{e}ederickz-like transition and eventually start\ndeviating from the shear-induced orientation, leading to an increase in shear\nstress. Upon further increase of $H$, a demixing of the magnetic particles from\nthe non-magnetic ones occurs which leads to a drop in shear stress, hence\ncreating a non-monotonic response to $H$. Unlike the equilibrium demixing\nphenomena reported in previous studies, the demixing observed here is neither\ndue to size-polydispersity nor due to a wall-induced nematic transition. Based\non a simplified Onsager analysis, we rather argue that it occurs solely due to\npacking entropy of particles with different shear- or magnetic-field-induced\norientations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 16:36:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-29"}

For the shared-link caching model, Maddah-Ali and\nNiesen (MAN) proposed a two-phase (placement and delivery) coded caching\nstrategy, which is order optimal within a constant factor. However, in the MAN\ncoded caching scheme, each user can obtain the information about the demands of\nother users, i.e., the MAN coded caching scheme is inherently prone to\ntampering and spying the activity/demands of other users. In this paper, we\nformulate an information-theoretic shared-link caching model with private\ndemands, where there are K cache-aided users (which can cache up to M files)\nconnected to a central server with access to N files. Each user requests L\nfiles. Our objective is to design a two-phase private caching scheme with\nminimum load while preserving the information-theoretic privacy of the demands\nof each user with respect to other users.\n  We propose two novel private coded caching schemes with the general\nunderlying idea, which is to satisfy the users' requests by generating a set of\ncoded multicast messages that is symmetric with respect to the library files.\nIn the first scheme, we introduce a number of virtual users such that each\nL-subset of files is demanded by K real or virtual (effective) users and use\nthe MAN delivery to generate multicast messages. This scheme incurs in an\nextremely large sub-packetization. Then, we propose a second scheme based on a\nnovel MDS-coded cache placement. In this case, we generate multicast messages\nwhere each multicast message contains one MDS-coded symbol from each file in\nthe library and thus is again symmetric over all the files from the viewpoint\nof each user.

However, it has been shown [1] that replacing atomic\nobjects with linearizable implementations can affect the probability\ndistribution of execution outcomes in randomized algorithms. Thus, linearizable\nobjects are not always suitable replacements for atomic objects. A stricter\ncorrectness condition called strong linearizability has been developed and\nshown to be appropriate for randomized algorithms in a strong adaptive\nadversary model [1].

Evidence for the latter is provided by a\nstatistical procedure---referred to as Non-Poissonian Template Fitting\n(NPTF)---that distinguishes the smooth distribution of photons expected for\ndark matter annihilation from a \"clumpy\" photon distribution expected for point\nsources. In this paper, we perform an extensive study of the NPTF on simulated\ndata, exploring its ability to recover the flux and luminosity function of\nunresolved sources at the Galactic Center. When astrophysical background\nemission is perfectly modeled, we find that the NPTF successfully distinguishes\nbetween the dark matter and point source hypotheses when either component makes\nup the entirety of the GCE. When the GCE is a mixture of dark matter and point\nsources, the NPTF may fail to reconstruct the correct contribution of each\ncomponent. We further study the impact of mismodeling the Galactic diffuse\nbackgrounds, finding that while a dark matter signal could be attributed to\npoint sources in some outlying cases for the scenarios we consider, the\nsignificance of a true point source signal remains robust. Our work enables us\nto comment on a recent study by Leane and Slatyer (2019) that questions prior\nNPTF conclusions because the method does not recover an artificial dark matter\nsignal injected on actual Fermi data. We demonstrate that the failure of the\nNPTF to extract an artificial dark matter signal can be natural when point\nsources are present in the data---with the effect further exacerbated by the\npresence of diffuse mismodeling---and does not on its own invalidate the\nconclusions of the NPTF analysis in the Inner Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 18:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 14:53:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

The neutrinos are produced by the decay of\ncharged pions originating in ultrarelativistic protons that are accelerated\nthere. In the standard theory of tidal disruption events (TDEs), there are four\ndistinct phases from debris circularization of stellar debris to super- and\nsub-Eddington to radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). In addition,\nwe consider the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state in both the\nsuper-Eddington accretion and RIAF phases. We find that there are three\npromising cases to produce neutrino emissions: the super-Eddington accretion\nphase of the MAD state and the RIAF phases of both the non-MAD and MAD states.\nIn the super-Eddington MAD state, the enhanced magnetic field makes it possible\nto accelerate the protons to $E_{p,max}~0.35 PeV\n(M_bh/10^{7.7}M_\\odot)^{41/48}$ with the other given appropriate parameters.\nThe neutrino energy is then $E_{\\nu,pk}~67 TeV (M_bh/10^{7.7}M_\\odot)^{41/48}$\nat the peak of the energy spectrum.

This approach results in many of the rules being lost, so that the\nparse trees that result are often devoid of the detail that the BNF was\nsupposed to capture in the first place. Furthermore, the standard algorithm\nresults in exponential blow-up as the BNF is rewritten, making it wholly\nunworkable in practice. To avoid these pitfalls, we revise the standard\nalgorithm to eliminate direct left recursion and then take a graph-theoretic\napproach to eliminating indirect left recursion. We also extend the algorithm\nto rewrite the resultant parse trees in order to recover the parse trees that\nwould have resulted if left recursion had not had to be eliminated in the first\nplace. Therefore, aside from a couple of caveats, our algorithm works not just\nin theory but also in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 18:04:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2019 11:25:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Feb 2020 09:01:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 17:57:29 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 18 May 2023 15:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-19"}

For the former, we construct and study a\nmoduli space of \"logarithmic\" 1-dimensional sheaves and compare the resulting\nmultiplicity with tropical multiplicity. For the latter, we explicitly describe\nthe components of the moduli space and work out the logarithmic deformation\ntheory in full, which we then compare with the deformation theory of the\nanalogous relative stable maps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 19:05:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 18:33:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 May 2020 22:36:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 13:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 09:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

QoIs include\nspecies decay, product yield, and degree of mixing. The ROMs for QoIs are\napplied to quantify and understand how the chemical species evolve over time.\nFirst, high-resolution datasets for constructing ROMs are generated by solving\nanisotropic reaction-diffusion equations using a non-negative finite element\nformulation for different input parameters. Non-negative finite element\nformulation ensures that the species concentration is non-negative (which is\nneeded for computing QoIs) on coarse computational grids even under high\nanisotropy. The reactive-mixing model input parameters are a time-scale\nassociated with flipping of velocity, a spatial-scale controlling small/large\nvortex structures of velocity, a perturbation parameter of the vortex-based\nvelocity, anisotropic dispersion strength/contrast, and molecular diffusion.\nSecond, random forests, F-test, and mutual information criterion are used to\nevaluate the importance of model inputs/features with respect to QoIs. Third,\nSupport Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are used to\nconstruct ROMs based on the model inputs. Then, SVR-ROMs are used to predict\nscaling of QoIs. Qualitatively, SVR-ROMs are able to describe the trends\nobserved in the scaling law associated with QoIs. Fourth, the scaling law's\nexponent dependence on model inputs/features are evaluated using $k$-means\nclustering. Finally, in terms of the computational cost, the proposed SVM-ROMs\nand SVR-ROMs are $\\mathcal{O}(10^7)$ times faster than running a high-fidelity\nnumerical simulation for evaluating QoIs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 20:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-15"}

The Gaia mission, combined with large-scale\nspectroscopic surveys, is helping to build an unprecedented census in terms of\nthe astrometric, kinematic and chemical properties of Galactic stellar\npopulations. Within a decade, precise measurements of such properties will be\navailable for hundreds of millions of stars. Meanwhile, time-domain surveys\ninitiated with CoRoT and Kepler/K2 and carried on by space missions such as\nTESS and PLATO or ground-based projects like the LSST, will have brought\nasteroseismology to a high level of maturity. The combination of precise ages\nfrom asteroseismology with astrometric and spectroscopic data, on large stellar\nsamples, is allowing Galactic archaeologists to gain new insight into the\nassembly history of the Milky Way. Recent breakthroughs --- based on the\ndetection of solar-like oscillations in tens of thousands of red-giant stars\n--- demonstrate the potential of such approach. Therefore, we are convinced\nthat an all-sky, high-cadence, long-duration stellar variability survey will\nbecome a scientific priority in the 2035-50 period. The Chronos concept\npresented here consists in a time-domain extension to Gaia. It will allow for\nmass and age estimates for half a million red giants within 1.7 kpc from the\nSun and hence shed a new light on our understanding of the Galactic dynamics\nand archaeology. In terms of the targeted pulsators, Chronos will bridge the\ngap between PLATO and the LSST by surveying stars all the way from the subgiant\nbranch to the early AGB. Finally, it will surpass all previous surveys capable\nof conducting asteroseismology in terms of the combined sky coverage and\nduration of the observations (2 x 3.75 months over the whole sky and >5 years\nin the CVZ).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 22:42:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 13:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

After the base station (BS)\ndesigns a set of beamformers for a specific objective, the BS must select the\noperating or transmission data rate for each user. However, under channel\nuncertainty, higher transmission rates cause higher outage probability, and the\ndelivered rate drops. Since lower rates are not desirable, one must balance\nbetween the transmission rate and outage. In this paper, we first explain how\napproximating the PDF of a quadratic form with a positive definite matrix can\nbe used to obtain the outage probability for any set of beamfomers and\ntransmission rate. Then we focus on the specific case of maximizing the minimum\ndelivered rate, where we modify a robust beamforming approach to maximize the\nresulting goodput.

In this paper, we seek to challenge this approach\nand advocate for a principled design based on a systematic analysis of the\nperformance trade-offs of inverter-based frequency control. With this aim, we\nperform a qualitative and quantitative study comparing the effect of\nconventional control strategies --droop control (DC) and virtual inertia (VI)--\non several performance metrics induced by $\\mathcal L_2$ and $\\mathcal\nL_\\infty$ signal norms. By extending a recently proposed modal decomposition\nmethod, we capture the effect of step and stochastic power disturbances, and\nfrequency measurement noise, on the overall transient and steady-state behavior\nof the system. Our analysis unveils several limitations of these solutions,\nsuch as the inability of DC to improve dynamic frequency response without\nincreasing steady-state control effort, or the large frequency variance that VI\nintroduces in the presence of measurement noise. We further propose a novel\ndynam-i-c Droop controller (iDroop) that overcomes the limitations of DC and\nVI. More precisely, we show that iDroop can be tuned to achieve high noise\nrejection, fast system-wide synchronization, or frequency overshoot (Nadir)\nelimination without affecting the steady-state control effort share, and\npropose a tuning recommendation that strikes a balance among these objectives.\nExtensive numerical experimentation shows that the proposed tuning is effective\neven when our proportionality assumptions are not valid, and that the\nparticular tuning used for Nadir elimination strikes a good trade-off among\nvarious performance metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 23:05:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-30"}

To overcome these major challenges, this paper proposes a cascaded\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) framework and multi-echo gradient echo\n(meGRE) with a single reference variable flip angle (srVFA).\n  Methods: To optimize the echo times for each method, MR images are acquired\nusing a meGRE sequence; meGRE images with two flip angles (FAs) and meGRE\nimages with a single FA are acquired during the pretreatment and treatment\nstages, respectively. These images are then processed and reconstructed by a\ncascaded CNN, which consists of two CNNs. The first CNN (called DeepACCnet)\nperforms HR complex MR image reconstruction from the LR MR image acquired\nduring the treatment stage, which is improved by the HR magnitude MR image\nacquired during the pretreatment stage.

Recent studies\nusually involve three steps: first splitting a point cloud into some local\nregions, then extracting corresponding feature of each local region, and\nfinally aggregating all individual local region features into a global feature\nas shape representation using simple max pooling. However, such pooling-based\nfeature aggregation methods do not adequately take the spatial relationships\nbetween local regions into account, which greatly limits the ability to learn\ndiscriminative shape representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel\ndeep learning network, named Point2SpatialCapsule, for aggregating features and\nspatial relationships of local regions on point clouds, which aims to learn\nmore discriminative shape representation. Compared with traditional max-pooling\nbased feature aggregation networks, Point2SpatialCapsule can explicitly learn\nnot only geometric features of local regions but also spatial relationships\namong them. It consists of two modules. To resolve the disorder problem of\nlocal regions, the first module, named geometric feature aggregation, is\ndesigned to aggregate the local region features into the learnable cluster\ncenters, which explicitly encodes the spatial locations from the original 3D\nspace. The second module, named spatial relationship aggregation, is proposed\nfor further aggregating clustered features and the spatial relationships among\nthem in the feature space using the spatial-aware capsules developed in this\npaper. Compared to the previous capsule network based methods, the feature\nrouting on the spatial-aware capsules can learn more discriminative spatial\nrelationships among local regions for point clouds, which establishes a direct\nmapping between log priors and the spatial locations through feature clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 02:54:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

In the considered\nmodel, drone base stations (DBSs) provide downlink connectivity,\nsupplementally, to ground users whose demand cannot be satisfied by terrestrial\nsmall cell base stations (SBSs). Meanwhile, a satellite system and a set of\nterrestrial macrocell base stations (MBSs) are used to provide resources for\nbackhaul connectivity for both DBSs and SBSs. For this scenario, one must\njointly consider resource management over satellite-DBS/SBS backhaul links,\nMBS-DBS/SBS terrestrial backhaul links, and DBS/SBS-user radio access links as\nwell as user association with DBSs and SBSs. This joint user association and\nresource allocation problem is modeled using a competitive market setting in\nwhich the transmission data is considered as a good that is being exchanged\nbetween users, DBSs, and SBSs that act as \"buyers\", and DBSs, SBSs, MBSs, and\nthe satellite that act as \"sellers\". In this market, the quality-of-service\n(QoS) is used to capture the quality of the data transmission (defined as\ngood), while the energy consumption the buyers use for data transmission is the\ncost of exchanging a good. According to the quality of goods, sellers in the\nmarket propose quotations to the buyers to sell their goods, while the buyers\npurchase the goods based on the quotation. The buyers profit from the\ndifference between the earned QoS and the charged price, while the sellers\nprofit from the difference between earned price and the energy spent for data\ntransmission. The buyers and sellers in the market seek to reach a Walrasian\nequilibrium, at which all the goods are sold, and each of the devices' profit\nis maximized. A heavy ball based iterative algorithm is proposed to compute the\nWalrasian equilibrium of the formulated market.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 03:58:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-30"}

Finally, it takes meteorological data from three locations\nnear the southeast coast of China as examples to examine the algorithm\nperformance. Based on classification results, the extreme wind speeds\ncalculated based on mixed wind hazard types is compared with those obtained\nfrom conventional methods, and the effects on structural design for different\nreturn periods are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 04:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-30"}

The dominating paradigm for tracking this flow of knowledge is to\ncount the number of direct citations, but this neglects the fact that beneath\nthe first layer of citations there is a full body of literature. In this study,\nwe go underneath the \"shoulders\" by investigating the cumulative knowledge\ncreation process in a citation network of around 35 million publications. In\nparticular, we study stylized models of persistent influence and diffusion that\ntake into account all the possible chains of citations. When we study the\npersistent influence values of publications and their citation counts, we find\nthat the publications related to Nobel Prizes i.e. Nobel papers have higher\nranks in terms of persistent influence than that due to citations, and that the\nmost outperforming publications are typically early works leading to hot\nresearch topics of their time. The diffusion model reveals a significant\nvariation in the rates at which different fields of research share knowledge.\nWe find that these rates have been increasing systematically for several\ndecades, which can be explained by the increase in the publication volumes.\nOverall, our results suggest that analyzing cumulative knowledge creation on a\nglobal scale can be useful in estimating the type and scale of scientific\ninfluence of individual publications and entire research areas as well as\nyielding insights which could not be discovered by using only the direct\ncitation counts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 08:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-30"}

This is achieved with a framework that predicts depth and camera\nmotion, with a loss based on reconstructing a target video frame from\ntemporally adjacent frames. In this context, occlusion relates to parts of a\nscene that can be observed in the target frame but not in a frame used for\nimage reconstruction. Since the image reconstruction is based on sampling from\nthe adjacent frame, and occluded areas by definition cannot be sampled,\nreconstructed occluded areas corrupt to the supervisory signal. In previous\nwork arXiv:1806.01260 occlusion is handled based on reconstruction error; at\neach pixel location, only the reconstruction with the lowest error is included\nin the loss. The current study aims to determine whether performance\nimprovements of depth estimation models can be gained by during training only\nignoring those regions that are affected by occlusion.\n  In this work we introduce occlusion mask, a mask that during training can be\nused to specifically ignore regions that cannot be reconstructed due to\nocclusions. Occlusion mask is based entirely on predicted depth information. We\nintroduce two novel loss formulations which incorporate the occlusion mask. The\nmethod and implementation of arXiv:1806.01260 serves as the foundation for our\nmodifications as well as the baseline in our experiments. We demonstrate that\n(i) incorporating occlusion mask in the loss function improves the performance\nof single image depth prediction models on the KITTI benchmark. (ii) loss\nfunctions that select from reconstructions based on error are able to ignore\nsome of the reprojection error caused by object motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 09:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-30"}

This is particularly pronounced in the star\nformation desert (SFD) which is defined as two symmetrical regions either side\nof the bar that show a deficit in young stars. Previous studies proposed that,\nif star formation is truncated because of the influence of the bar, then the\nage distribution of stars within the SFD could be used to determine the epoch\nof bar formation. To test this, we study the properties of SFDs in 6 galaxies\nfrom zoom-in cosmological re-simulations. Age maps reveal old regions on both\nsides of the bars, with a lack of stars younger than 10 Myr, confirming the SFD\nphenomenon. Local star formation is truncated in the SFDs because after the bar\nforms, gas in these regions is removed on 1 Gyr timescales. However, the\noverall age distribution of stars in the SFD does not show a sharp truncation\nafter bar formation but rather a gradual downturn in comparison to that of the\nbar. This more subtle signature may still give information on bar formation\nepochs in observed galaxies, but the interpretation will be more difficult than\noriginally hoped. The gradual drop in the SFD age distribution, instead of a\ntruncation, is due to radial migration of stars born in the disk. The SFD is\nthus one of the only regions where an uncontaminated sample of stars only\naffected by radial migration can be studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 09:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

When these Bell tests are implemented with devices having too low\nefficiency, one has to post-select the events that lead to successful\ndetections and thus rely on a fair sampling assumption. The question that we\naddress in this paper is what remains of a device-independent certification\nunder fair sampling. We provide an intuitive description of post-selections in\nterms of filters and define the fair sampling assumption as a property of these\nfilters, equivalent to the definition introduced in [Berry et. al., PRA 81(1),\n012109 (2010)]. When this assumption is fulfilled, the post-selected data is\nreproduced by an ideal experiment where lossless devices measure a filtered\nstate which can be obtained from the actual state via local probabilistic maps.\nTrusted conclusions can thus be obtained on the quantum properties of this\nfiltered state and the corresponding measurement statistics can reliably be\nused, e.g., for randomness generation or quantum key distribution. We also\nexplore a stronger notion of fair sampling leading to the conclusion that the\npost-selected data is a fair representation of the data that would be obtained\nwith lossless detections. Furthermore, we show that our conclusions hold in\ncases of small deviations from exact fair sampling.

Dedicated inter-datacenter networks\nhave been built that provide high visibility into the network status and\nflexible control over traffic forwarding to offer quality communication across\nthe instances of applications hosted on many datacenters. These networks are\nrelatively small, with tens to hundreds of nodes and are managed by the same\norganization that operates the datacenters which make centralized traffic\nengineering feasible. Using coordinated data transmission from the services and\nrouting over the inter-datacenter network, one can optimize the network\nperformance according to a variety of utility functions that take into account\ndata transfer deadlines, network capacity consumption, and transfer completion\ntimes.\n  In this dissertation, we study techniques and algorithms for fast and\nefficient data transfers across geographically dispersed datacenters over the\ninter-datacenter networks.

Attackers may exploit this interface to leak data\nor corrupt the computation.\n  We describe SGX-LKL, a system for running Linux binaries inside of Intel SGX\nenclaves that only exposes a minimal, protected and oblivious host interface:\nthe interface is (i) minimal because SGX-LKL uses a complete library OS inside\nthe enclave, including file system and network stacks, which requires a host\ninterface with only 7 calls; (ii) protected because SGX-LKL transparently\nencrypts and integrity-protects all data passed via low-level I/O operations;\nand (iii) oblivious because SGX-LKL performs host operations independently of\nthe application workload. For oblivious disk I/O, SGX-LKL uses an encrypted\next4 file system with shuffled disk blocks. We show that SGX-LKL protects\nTensorFlow training with a 21% overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 10:25:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 21:03:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2020 12:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

This process is driven by the exponential amplification\nof a population of longitudinal microtubules, created by severing events\nlocalized at crossovers with the microtubules of the pre-existing transverse\narray. We present a dynamic one-dimensional model for microtubule amplification\nthrough this type of templated severing. We focus on the role of the\nprobability of immediate rescue-after-severing of the newly-created lagging\nmicrotubule, observed to be a characteristic feature of the reorientation\nprocess. Employing stochastic simulations, we show that in the dynamic regime\nof unbounded microtubule growth, a finite value of this probability is not\nrequired for amplification to occur, but does strongly influence the degree of\namplification, and hence the speed of the reorientation process. In contrast,\nin the regime of bounded microtubule growth, we show that amplification only\noccurs above a critical threshold. We construct an approximate analytical\ntheory, based on a priori limiting the number of crossover events considered,\nwhich allows us to predict the observed critical value of the\nrescue-after-severing probability with reasonable accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 10:40:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

We trial three generic profiles for HI surface\ndensity as a function of radius. Firstly, we assert that HI surface densities\nsaturate at a variable threshold, and otherwise fall off exponentially with\nradius or, secondly, radius squared. Our third model assumes the total gas\nsurface density is exponential, with the HI fraction at each radius depending\non local pressure. These are tested against a compilation of 110 galaxies from\nthe THINGS, LITTLE THINGS, LVHIS, and Bluedisk surveys, whose HI surface\ndensity profiles are well resolved. All models fit the observations well and\npredict consistent size-mass relations. Using an analytical argument, we\nexplain why processes that cause gas disc truncation - such as ram-pressure\nstripping - scarcely affect the HI size-mass relation. This is tested with the\nIllustrisTNG(100) cosmological, hydrodynamic simulation and the Dark Sage\nsemi-analytic model of galaxy formation, both of which capture radially\nresolved disc structure. For galaxies with m_*>10^9 M_solar and m_HI>10^8\nM_solar, both simulations predict HI size-mass relations that align with\nobservations, show no difference between central and satellite galaxies, and\nshow only a minor, second-order dependence on host halo mass for satellites.\nUltimately, the universally tight HI size-mass relation is mathematically\ninevitable and robust. Only by completely disrupting the structure of HI discs,\ne.g. through overly powerful feedback, could a simulation predict the relation\npoorly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 11:00:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 2019 09:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-04"}

CAVs can improve their perception\ncapabilities if vehicles exchange information about what they sense using V2X\ncommunications. This is known as cooperative or collective perception (or\nsensing). A frequent transmission of collective perception messages could\nimprove the perception capabilities of CAVs. However, this improvement can be\ncompromised if vehicles generate too many messages and saturate the\ncommunications channel. An important aspect is then when vehicles should\ngenerate the perception messages. ETSI has proposed the first set of message\ngeneration rules for collective perception.

Here we\nconsider a challenge to such tests, namely that quantum gravity corrections of\ncanonical commutation relations are expected to be suppressed with increasing\nnumber of constituent particles. Since the precise scaling of this suppression\nis unknown, it needs to be bounded experimentally and explicitly incorporated\ninto rigorous analyses of quantum gravity tests. We analyse this scaling based\non concrete experiments involving macroscopic pendula and provide tight bounds\nthat exceed those of current experiments based on quantum mechanical\noscillators.

Increasing the\nMn doping level (x) leads to a delicate control of the carrier density as well\nas a raise in the electron mobility and spin polarization. Herein, we\ndemonstrate a tunable Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and spin polarization of\nLAMO/STO (0.2 <= x <= 0.3) by applying a back gate. The presence of SOC causes\nthe splitting of energy band into two branches by a spin splitting energy. The\nmaximum spin splitting energy depends on the Mn doping and decreases with the\nincreasing Mn content and then vanishes at x = 0.3. The carrier density\ndependence of the spin splitting energy for different compositions shows a\ndome-shaped behavior with a maximum at different normalized carrier density.\nThese findings have not yet been observed in LAO/STO interfaces. A fully\nback-gate-tunable spin-polarized 2DEL is observed at the interface with x = 0.3\nwhere only dxy orbits are populated (5.3E12 cm-2 <= ns <= 1.0E13 cm-2).

To ensure that\nthe system complies with the adaptation goals, recent research suggests the use\nof formal techniques at runtime. Yet, existing approaches have three\nlimitations that affect their practical applicability: (i) they ignore\ncorrectness of the behavior of the feedback loop, (ii) they rely on exhaustive\nverification at runtime to select adaptation options to realize the adaptation\ngoals, which is time and resource demanding, and (iii) they provide limited or\nno support for changing adaptation goals at runtime. To tackle these\nshortcomings, we present ActivFORMS (Active FORmal Models for Self-adaptation).\nActivFORMS contributes an end-to-end approach for engineering self-adaptive\nsystems, spanning four main stages of the life cycle of a feedback loop:\ndesign, deployment, runtime adaptation, and evolution. We also present\nActivFORMS-ta, a tool-supported instance of ActivFORMS that leverages timed\nautomata models and statistical model checking at runtime. We validate the\nresearch results using an IoT application for building security monitoring that\nis deployed in Leuven.

At the leading level of approximation, reconstruction of bulk\nphysics implies that local probes of the black hole should exhibit free\npropagation and unitary local evolution.

This model\nconsiders cell detection as a task of finding most probable locations that\nsuggest cell centers in an image. It represents this main task with a\nregression task of learning an inner distance metric. However, different than\nthe previously reported regression based methods, the DeepDistance model\nproposes to approach its learning as a multi-task regression problem where\nmultiple tasks are learned by using shared feature representations. To this\nend, it defines a secondary metric, normalized outer distance, to represent a\ndifferent aspect of the problem and proposes to define its learning as\ncomplementary to the main cell detection task. In order to learn these two\ncomplementary tasks more effectively, the DeepDistance model designs a fully\nconvolutional network (FCN) with a shared encoder path and end-to-end trains\nthis FCN to concurrently learn the tasks in parallel. DeepDistance uses the\ninner distances estimated by this FCN in a detection algorithm to locate\nindividual cells in a given image. For further performance improvement on the\nmain task, this paper also presents an extended version of the DeepDistance\nmodel. This extended model includes an auxiliary classification task and learns\nit in parallel to the two regression tasks by sharing feature representations\nwith them. Our experiments on three different human cell lines reveal that the\nproposed multi-task learning models, the DeepDistance model and its extended\nversion, successfully identify cell locations, even for the cell line that was\nnot used in training, and improve the results of the previous deep learning\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 13:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-30"}

Thus, the\nlearned models are guaranteed to inherit the well-studied properties of reduced\nmodels from traditional model reduction.

Methods: This study combines the large dataset of\nXMM-Newton observations of the SMC, archival and recent radio continuum\nobservations, an optical line emission survey, and new optical spectroscopic\nobservations. We can thus build a complete and clean sample of 19 confirmed and\n4 candidate SNRs. The homogeneous X-ray spectral analysis allows to search for\nSN ejecta and Fe K line emission, and to measure interstellar medium (ISM)\nabundances. We estimate the ratio of core-collapse to type Ia supernova rates\nof the SMC based on the X-ray properties and the local stellar environment of\neach SNR. Results : After the removal of unconfirmed or misclassified objects,\nand the addition of two newly confirmed SNRs based on multi-wavelength\nfeatures, we present a final list of 21 confirmed SNRs and 2 candidates. While\nno Fe K line is detected even for the brightest and youngest SNR, we find X-ray\nevidence of SN ejecta in 11 SNRs.

The\nhot-gas abundances of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe are 0.1-0.2 times solar. Their ratios\nwith respect to SMC stellar abundances reflect the effects of dust depletion\nand partial dust destruction in SNR shocks. We find evidence that the ambient\nmedium probed by SMC SNRs is less disturbed and less dense on average than in\nthe LMC, consistent with the different morphologies of the two galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 13:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-13"}

Inclusion of effective charges\ndetermined via the optical phonon mode splitting provides a stable model for\nall but two of the materials considered (zincblende GaN and AlN). A stable\nmodel is obtained for all materials considered by also utilising the inner\nelastic constant $E_{11}$ to determine the magnitude of the effective charges\nused in the Coulomb interaction. Test calculations show that the models\ndescribe well structural relaxation in superlattices and alloys, and reproduce\nkey phonon band structure features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 14:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

To have a significant\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC), we analyze a situation where the characteristic\nenergy of the periodic driving is not necessarily small compared to the driving\nenergy $\\hbar\\omega$. Applying a unitary transformation to eliminate the\noriginal periodic perturbation, we arrive at a non-Abelian (non-commuting)\nvector potential term describing the 3D SOC.

Multi-line studies of the molecule have\nshown that the excitation temperature of PN is usually lower than the gas\nkinetic temperature, suggesting that PN is likely in conditions of sub-thermal\nexcitation. We present an analysis of PN which takes the possible sub-thermal\nexcitation conditions into account in a sample of 24 massive star-forming\nregions. We observed PN (2-1), (3-2), (4-3), and (6-5) with the IRAM-30m and\nAPEX telescopes and detected PN lines in 15 of them. Together with 9 similar\nsources detected in PN in previous works, we have analysed the largest sample\nof star-forming regions to date, made of 33 sources with 24 detections in total\n(among which 13 are new detections). Hence, we have increased the number of\nstar-forming regions detected in PN by more than a factor 2. Our analysis\nindicates that the PN lines are indeed sub-thermally excited, but well\ndescribed by a single excitation temperature. We have compared line profiles\nand fractional abundances of PN and SiO, a typical shock tracer, and found that\nalmost all objects detected in PN have high-velocity SiO wings. Moreover, the\nSiO and PN abundances with respect to H2 are correlated over several orders of\nmagnitude, and uncorrelated with gas temperature. This clearly shows that the\nproduction of PN is strongly linked to the presence of shocked gas, and rules\nout alternative scenarios based on thermal evaporation from iced grain mantles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 15:06:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

As a result, its sensitivity does not\nreally degrade over time; in fact, the relevance of a genomic sequence is\nlikely to be longer than the security provided by encryption. This prompts the\nneed for specialized techniques providing long-term security for genomic data,\nyet the only available tool for this purpose is GenoGuard (Huang et al., 2015).\nBy relying on Honey Encryption, GenoGuard is secure against an adversary that\ncan brute force all possible keys; i.e., whenever an attacker tries to decrypt\nusing an incorrect password, she will obtain an incorrect but plausible looking\ndecoy sequence.\n  In this paper, we set to analyze the real-world security guarantees provided\nby GenoGuard; specifically, assess how much more information does access to a\nciphertext encrypted using GenoGuard yield, compared to one that was not.\nOverall, we find that, if the adversary has access to side information in the\nform of partial information from the target sequence, the use of GenoGuard does\nappreciably increase her power in determining the rest of the sequence. We show\nthat, in the case of a sequence encrypted using an easily guessable\n(low-entropy) password, the adversary is able to rule out most decoy sequences,\nand obtain the target sequence with just 2.5\\% of it available as side\ninformation. In the case of a harder-to-guess (high-entropy) password, we show\nthat the adversary still obtains, on average, better accuracy in guessing the\nrest of the target sequences than using state-of-the-art genomic sequence\ninference methods, obtaining up to 15% improvement in accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 15:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-30"}

However, a\nrecent analysis (based on a proposed single-field effective theory with an\nimaginary speed of sound) found that the trispectrum and other higher-order,\nnon-Gaussian correlators also undergo similar exponential enhancements. This\narguably leads to `hyper-large' non-Gaussianities in stark conflict with\nobservations, and even to the loss of perturbative control of the calculations.\nIn this paper, we provide the first analytic solution of the growth of the\nperturbations in two-field rapid-turn models, and find it in good agreement\nwith previous numerical and single-field EFT estimates. We also show that the\nnested structure of commutators of the in-in formalism has subtle and crucial\nconsequences: accounting for these commutators, we show analytically that the\nnaively leading-order piece (which indeed is exponentially large) cancels\nexactly in all relevant correlators. The remaining non-Gaussianities of these\nmodels are modest, and there is no problem with perturbative control from the\nexponential enhancement of $\\zeta$. Thus, rapid-turn inflation with negatively\ncurved field spaces remains a viable and interesting class of candidate\ntheories of the early universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 15:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

Indeed, the majority of points are won by the server, making\nthe serve one of the most important elements in this sport. In this paper, we\nfocus on the role of the serve advantage in winning a point as a function of\nthe rally length. We propose a Bayesian isotonic logistic regression model for\nthe probability of winning a point on serve. In particular, we decompose the\nlogit of the probability of winning via a linear combination of B-splines basis\nfunctions, with athlete-specific basis function coefficients. Further, we\nensure the serve advantage decreases with rally length by imposing constraints\non the spline coefficients. We also consider the rally ability of each player,\nand study how the different types of court may impact on the player's rally\nability. We apply our methodology to a Grand Slam singles matches dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 09:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

We describe in\nfull detail a unified, compact and dimension-independent procedure to design\nrelativistic LB schemes capable of bridging the gap between the\nultra-relativistic regime, $k_{\\rm B} T \\gg mc^2$, and the non-relativistic\none, $k_{\\rm B} T \\ll mc^2$. We further develop a systematic derivation of the\ntransport coefficients as a function of the kinetic relaxation time in\n$d=1,2,3$ spatial dimensions. The latter step allows to establish a\nquantitative bridge between the parameters of the kinetic model and the\nmacroscopic transport coefficients. This leads to accurate calibrations of\nsimulation parameters and is also relevant at the theoretical level, as it\nprovides neat numerical evidence of the correctness of the Chapman-Enskog\nprocedure. We present an extended set of validation tests, in which simulation\nresults based on the RLBMs are compared with existing analytic or semi-analytic\nresults in the mildly-relativistic ($k_{\\rm B} T \\sim mc^2$) regime for the\ncase of shock propagations in quark-gluon plasmas and laminar electronic flows\nin ultra-clean graphene samples. It is hoped and expected that the material\ncollected in this paper may allow the interested readers to reproduce the\npresent results and generate new applications of the RLBM scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 13:26:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 16:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

Such domains rely on relational representations to capture\ncomplex relationships between entities and their attributes. Thus, we consider\nthe problem of learning neural networks for relational data. We distinguish\nourselves from current approaches that rely on expert hand-coded rules by\nlearning relational random-walk-based features to capture local structural\ninteractions and the resulting network architecture. We further exploit\nparameter tying of the network weights of the resulting relational neural\nnetwork, where instances of the same type share parameters.

However, these road\nintersections are mainly represented as point elements without detailed\ninformation, or are even not available in current versions of crowdsourced\nmapping databases including OpenStreetMap(OSM). This study develops an approach\nto automatically detect road objects and place them to right location from\nstreet-level images. Our processing pipeline relies on two convolutional neural\nnetworks: the first segments the images, while the second detects and\nclassifies the specific objects. Moreover, to locate the detected objects, we\nestablish an attributed topological binary tree(ATBT) based on urban grammar\nfor each image to depict the coherent relations of topologies, attributes and\nsemantics of the road objects. Then the ATBT is further matched with map\nfeatures on OSM to determine the right placed location. The proposed method has\nbeen applied to a case study in Berlin, Germany. We validate the effectiveness\nof our method on two object classes: traffic signs and traffic lights.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides\nnear-precise localization results in terms of completeness and positional\naccuracy. Among many potential applications, the output may be combined with\nother sources of data to guide autonomous vehicles\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 14:45:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 02:20:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 11:06:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

An\nanalysis with modern methods shows that the data used by Halley do not contain\nsignificant evidence for proper motion. What Halley found are the measurement\nerrors of Ptolemaios and Brahe. Halley further argued that the occultation of\nAldebaran by the Moon on 11 March 509 in Athens confirmed the change in\nlatitude of Aldebaran. In fact, however, the relevant observation was almost\ncertainly made in Alexandria where Aldebaran was not occulted. By carefully\nconsidering measurement errors Jacques Cassini showed that Halley's results\nfrom comparison with earlier astronomers were spurious, a conclusion partially\nconfirmed by various later authors.
