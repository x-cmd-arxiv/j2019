However, when a small (or rare)\nsubpopulation is the group of interest, this approach is unlikely to yield a\nsample size large enough to produce precise inferences. Non-probability (or\nconvenience) sampling often provides the necessary sample size to yield\nefficient estimates, but selection bias may compromise the generalizability of\nresults to the broader population. Motivating the exposition is a survey of\nmilitary caregivers; our interest is focused on unpaid caregivers of wounded,\nill, or injured servicemembers and veterans who served in the US armed forces\nfollowing September 11, 2001. An extensive probability sampling effort yielded\nonly 72 caregivers from this subpopulation. Therefore, we consider\nsupplementing the probability sample with a convenience sample from the same\nsubpopulation, and we develop novel methods of statistical weighting that may\nbe used to combine (or blend) the samples. Our analyses show that the\nsubpopulation of interest endures greater hardships than caregivers of veterans\nwith earlier dates of service, and these conclusions are discernably stronger\nwhen blended samples with the proposed weighting schemes are used. We conclude\nwith simulation studies that illustrate the efficacy of the proposed\ntechniques, examine the bias-variance trade-off encountered when using\ninadequately blended data, and show that the gain in precision provided by the\nconvenience sample is lower in circumstances where the outcome is strongly\nrelated to the auxiliary variables used for blending.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 16:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

As a general method to address this problem of invariant inference,\nwe propose a randomization-based procedure. We prove general conditions for\nasymptotic validity of this procedure, and illustrate in many data structures,\nincluding clustered errors in one-way and two-way layouts. We find that\ninvariant inference via residual randomization has three appealing properties:\n(1) It is valid under weak and interpretable conditions, allowing for problems\nwith heavy-tailed data, finite clustering, and even some high-dimensional\nsettings. (2) It is robust in finite samples as it does not rely on the\nregularity conditions needed for classical asymptotics. (3) It addresses the\nproblem of inference in a unified way that adapts to the data structure.\nClassical procedures like OLS or bootstrap, on the other hand, presuppose the\ni.i.d. structure, and need to be modified whenever the actual problem structure\nis different. This mismatch in the classical framework has led to a multitude\nof robust error techniques and bootstrap variants, which frequently confounds\napplied research.

This gives rise to\nthe new concept of geometrical smeariness. In consequence, the sphere can be\ndeformed, say, by removing a neighborhood of the antipodal point of the mean\nand gluing a flat space there, with a smooth transition piece.

Despite significant progress in the\nunderstanding of QP dynamics, pinpointing their origin and decreasing their\ndensity remain outstanding tasks. The cyclic process of recombination and\ngeneration of QPs implies the exchange of phonons between the superconducting\nthin film and the underlying substrate. Reducing the number of substrate\nphonons with frequencies exceeding the spectral gap of the superconductor\nshould result in a reduction of QPs. Indeed, we demonstrate that surrounding\nhigh impedance resonators made of granular aluminum (grAl) with lower gapped\nthin film aluminum islands increases the internal quality factors of the\nresonators in the single photon regime, suppresses the noise, and reduces the\nrate of observed QP bursts. The aluminum islands are positioned far enough from\nthe resonators to be electromagnetically decoupled, thus not changing the\nresonator frequency, nor the loading.

The transition can be understood\nas a nonanalytic change in the amount of information extracted by the\nmeasurements about the initial state of the system, quantified by the Fisher\ninformation. To compute the von~Neumann entanglement entropy $S$ and the Fisher\ninformation $\\mathcal{F}$, we apply a replica method based on a sequence of\nquantities $\\tilde{S}^{(n)}$ and $\\mathcal{F}^{(n)}$ that depend on the $n$-th\nmoments of density matrices and reduce to $S$ and $\\mathcal{F}$ in the limit\n$n\\to 1$. These quantities with $n\\ge 2$ are mapped to free energies of a\nclassical spin model with $n!$ internal states in two dimensions with specific\nboundary conditions. In particular, $\\tilde{S}^{(n)}$ is the excess free energy\nof a domain wall terminating on the top boundary, and $\\mathcal{F}^{(n)}$ is\nrelated to the magnetization on the bottom boundary. Phase transitions occur as\nthe spin models undergo ordering transitions in the bulk. Taking the limit of\nlarge local Hilbert space dimension $q$ followed by the replica limit $n\\to 1$,\nwe obtain the critical measurement probability $p_c=1/2$ and identify the\ntransition as a bond percolation in the 2D square lattice in this limit.\nFinally, we show there is no phase transition if the measurements are allowed\nin an arbitrary nonlocal basis, thereby highlighting the relation between the\nphase transition and information scrambling. We establish an explicit\nconnection between the entanglement phase transition and the purification\ndynamics of a mixed state evolution and discuss implications of our results to\nexperimental observations of the transition and simulability of quantum\ndynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 02:19:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 07:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-05"}

While\nsome post-hoc fixes have been proposed, in particular top-$k$ and nucleus\nsampling, they do not address the fact that the token-level probabilities\npredicted by the model are poor. In this paper we show that the likelihood\nobjective itself is at fault, resulting in a model that assigns too much\nprobability to sequences containing repeats and frequent words, unlike those\nfrom the human training distribution. We propose a new objective, unlikelihood\ntraining, which forces unlikely generations to be assigned lower probability by\nthe model. We show that both token and sequence level unlikelihood training\ngive less repetitive, less dull text while maintaining perplexity, giving\nsuperior generations using standard greedy or beam search. According to human\nevaluations, our approach with standard beam search also outperforms the\ncurrently popular decoding methods of nucleus sampling or beam blocking, thus\nproviding a strong alternative to existing techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 18:09:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 23:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-30"}

Typically,\nthe methods based on this approach operate at a fixed timescale - either a\nsingle time-instant (eg. frame-based) or a constant time duration (eg.\nvideo-clip based). But human abnormal activities can take place at different\ntimescales. For example, jumping is a short term anomaly and loitering is a\nlong term anomaly in a surveillance scenario. A single and pre-defined\ntimescale is not enough to capture the wide range of anomalies occurring with\ndifferent time duration. In this paper, we propose a multi-timescale model to\ncapture the temporal dynamics at different timescales. In particular, the\nproposed model makes future and past predictions at different timescales for a\ngiven input pose trajectory. The model is multi-layered where intermediate\nlayers are responsible to generate predictions corresponding to different\ntimescales. These predictions are combined to detect abnormal activities. In\naddition, we also introduce an abnormal activity data-set for research use that\ncontains 4,83,566 annotated frames.

These improvements serve to significantly reduce the\ndifficulty in producing image-based animations of humanoid characters, allowing\neven broader audiences to express their creativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 19:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

When studying Hund\nmetals using dynamical mean-field theory, one arrives at a self-consistent\n\"Hund impurity problem\" involving a multiorbital quantum impurity with nonzero\nHund coupling interacting with a metallic bath. If its spin and orbital degrees\nof freedom are screened at different energy scales, $T_\\mathrm{sp} <\nT_\\mathrm{orb}$, the intermediate energy window is governed by a novel NFL\nfixed point, whose nature had not yet been clarified. We resolve this problem\nby providing an analytical solution of a paradigmatic example of a Hund\nimpurity problem, involving two spin and three orbital degrees of freedom. To\nthis end, we combine a state-of-the-art implementation of the numerical\nrenormalization group, capable of exploiting non-Abelian symmetries, with a\ngeneralization of Affleck and Ludwig's conformal field theory (CFT) approach\nfor multichannel Kondo models. We characterize the NFL fixed point of Hund\nmetals in detail for a Kondo model with an impurity forming an\nSU(2)$\\times$SU(3) spin-orbital multiplet, tuned such that the NFL energy\nwindow is very wide. The impurity's spin and orbital susceptibilities then\nexhibit striking power-law behavior, which we explain using CFT arguments. We\nfind excellent agreement between CFT predictions and numerical renormalization\ngroup results. Our main physical conclusion is that the regime of spin-orbital\nseparation, where orbital degrees of freedom have been screened but spin\ndegrees of freedom have not, features anomalously strong local spin\nfluctuations: the impurity susceptibility increases as\n$\\chi_\\mathrm{sp}^\\mathrm{imp} \\sim \\omega^{-\\gamma}$, with $\\gamma > 1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 20:10:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 20:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-07"}

To this\nend, we introduce a new dataset and propose a method that combines information\nretrieval techniques for selecting relevant reviews (given a question) and\n\"reading comprehension\" models for synthesizing an answer (given a question and\nreview). Our dataset consists of 923k questions, 3.6M answers and 14M reviews\nacross 156k products. Building on the well-known Amazon dataset, we collect\nadditional annotations, marking each question as either answerable or\nunanswerable based on the available reviews. A deployed system could first\nclassify a question as answerable and then attempt to generate an answer.\nNotably, unlike many popular QA datasets, here, the questions, passages, and\nanswers are all extracted from real human interactions. We evaluate numerous\nmodels for answer generation and propose strong baselines, demonstrating the\nchallenging nature of this new task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 20:18:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 23:34:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-22"}

Starting from the 1960s, practitioners and researchers have\nlooked for ways to empirically investigate new technologies such as inspecting\nthe effectiveness of new methods, tools, or practices. With this purpose, the\nempirical software engineering domain started to identify different empirical\nmethods, borrowing them from various domains such as medicine, biology, and\npsychology. Nowadays, a variety of empirical methods are commonly applied in\nsoftware engineering, ranging from controlled and quasi-controlled experiments\nto case studies, from systematic literature reviews to the newly introduced\nmultivocal literature reviews. However, to date, the only available method for\nproving any cause-effect relationship are controlled experiments. Objectives.\nThe goal of the thesis is introducing new methodologies for studying causality\nin empirical software engineering. Methods. Other fields use observational\nstudies for proving causality. They allow observing the effect of a risk factor\nand testing this without trying to change who is or is not exposed to it. As an\nexample, with an observational study it is possible to observe the effect of\npollution on the growth of a forest or the effect of different factors on\ndevelopment productivity without the need of waiting years for the forest to\ngrow or exposing developers to a specific treatment. Conclusion. In this\nthesis, we aim at defining a methodology for applying observational studies in\nempirical software engineering, providing guidelines on how to conduct such\nstudies, how to analyze the data, and how to report the studies themselves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 20:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

One of the\nprimary components of such a robotic platform is the state estimation engine,\nwhich enables the platform to reason about itself and the environment based\nupon sensor readings. When such sensor readings are degraded traditional state\nestimation approaches are known to breakdown. To overcome this issue, several\nrobust state estimation frameworks have been proposed. One such method is the\nbatch covariance estimation (BCE) framework. The BCE approach enables robust\nstate estimation by iteratively updating the measurement error uncertainty\nmodel through the fitting of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to the measurement\nresiduals. This paper extends upon the BCE approach by arguing that the\nuncertainty estimation process should be augmented to include metadata (e.g.,\nthe signal strength of the associated GNSS observation). The modification of\nthe uncertainty estimation process to an augmented data space is significant\nbecause it increases the likelihood of a unique partitioning in the measurement\nresidual domain and thus provides the ability to more accurately characterize\nthe measurement uncertainty model. The proposed batch covariance estimation\nover an augmented data-space (BCE-AD) is experimentally validated on collected\ndata where it is shown that a significant increase in state estimation accuracy\ncan be granted compared to previously proposed robust estimation techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 20:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

With one more dimension, the forwarding table will\ngrow explosively given a straightforward implementation. As a result, it is\nimpossible to fit the forwarding table to the current TCAM, which is the de\nfacto standard despite its limited capacity. To solve the explosion problem, we\npropose a forwarding table structure with a novel separation of TCAM and SRAM.\nAs such, we move the redundancies in expensive TCAM to cheaper SRAM, while the\nlookup speed is comparable with conventional routers.

To reduce the time complexity of constructing the\nfeasible search set and also to induce robustness to changes in the operational\nfactors, we perform our suboptimal policy design in a receding horizon fashion.\nThen, to compensate for the shortsightedness of the receding horizon approach\nfor reward distribution beyond the feasible policies of the agents over the\nreceding horizon, we add a new term to our utility, which provides a measure of\nnodal importance beyond the receding horizon's sight. This term gives the\npolicy design an intuition to steer the agents towards the nodes with higher\nrewards on the patrolling graph. Finally, we discuss how our proposed algorithm\ncan be implemented in a decentralized manner. A simulation study demonstrates\nour results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 22:24:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 06:04:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 05:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

It is common that the asset owners and enterprise network operators\nneed to work with cybersecurity professionals to manage the risk by\nremunerating them for their efforts that are not directly observable. In this\npaper, we use a principal-agent framework to capture the service relationships\nbetween the two parties, i.e., the asset owner (principal) and the cyber risk\nmanager (agent). Specifically, we consider a dynamic systemic risk management\nproblem with asymmetric information where the principal can only observe cyber\nrisk outcomes of the enterprise network rather than directly the efforts that\nthe manager expends on protecting the resources. Under this information\npattern, the principal aims to minimize the systemic cyber risks by designing a\ndynamic contract that specifies the compensation flows and the anticipated\nefforts of the manager by taking into account his incentives and rational\nbehaviors. We formulate a bi-level mechanism design problem for dynamic\ncontract design within the framework of a class of stochastic differential\ngames. We show that the principal has rational controllability of the systemic\nrisk by designing an incentive compatible estimator of the agent's hidden\nefforts. We characterize the optimal solution by reformulating the problem as a\nstochastic optimal control program which can be solved using dynamic\nprogramming. We further investigate a benchmark scenario with complete\ninformation and identify conditions that yield zero information rent and lead\nto a new certainty equivalence principle for principal-agent problems.

To explain this, it has\nbeen observed that as a network grows certain subsets of the network begin to\nspecialize the function(s) they perform. A recent model of network growth based\non this notion of specialization has been able to reproduce some of the most\nwell-known topological features found in real-world networks including\nright-skewed degree distributions, the small world property, modular as well as\nhierarchical topology, etc. Here we describe how specialization under this\nmodel also effects the spectral properties of a network.

Specifically, we show that if a network is intrinsically\nstable, which is a stronger version of the standard notion of global stability,\nthen the network maintains this type of dynamics as the network evolves. This\nis one of the first steps toward unifying the rigorous study of the two types\nof dynamics exhibited by networks.

In this work, we aim at investigating\nthe implementation of contact angles in the pseudopotential LB simulations with\ncurved boundaries. In the pseudopotential LB model, the contact angle is\nusually realized by employing a solid-fluid interaction or specifying a\nconstant virtual wall density. However, it is shown that the solid-fluid\ninteraction scheme yields very large spurious currents in the simulations\ninvolving curved boundaries, while the virtual-density scheme produces an\nunphysical thick mass-transfer layer near the solid boundary although it gives\nmuch smaller spurious currents. We also extend the geometric-formulation scheme\nin the phase-field method to the pseudopotential LB model. Nevertheless, in\ncomparison with the solid-fluid interaction scheme and the virtual-density\nscheme, the geometric-formulation scheme is relatively difficult to implement\nfor curved boundaries and cannot be directly applied to three-dimensional\nspace. By analyzing the features of these three schemes, we propose an improved\nvirtual-density scheme to implement contact angles in the pseudopotential LB\nsimulations with curved boundaries, which does not suffer from a thick\nmass-transfer layer near the solid boundary and retains the advantages of the\noriginal virtual-density scheme, i.e., simplicity, easiness for implementation,\nand low spurious currents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 00:20:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 2019 01:26:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 19:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

With the development of multimedia technology, fake news attempts to\nutilize multimedia contents with images or videos to attract and mislead\nreaders for rapid dissemination, which makes visual contents an important part\nof fake news. Fake-news images, images attached in fake news posts,include not\nonly fake images which are maliciously tampered but also real images which are\nwrongly used to represent irrelevant events. Hence, how to fully exploit the\ninherent characteristics of fake-news images is an important but challenging\nproblem for fake news detection.

Remarkably, unlike the\nFeshbach resonances in alkali atoms, the open and closed channels of the OFR\nare only very weakly detuned in energy. This leads to a unique effect whereby a\nmedium in the closed channel can Pauli block, or frustrate, the two-body\nscattering processes. Here, we theoretically investigate the impact of\nfrustration in the few- and many-body limits of the experimentally accessible\nthree-dimensional $^{173}$Yb system. We find that by adding a closed-channel\natom to the two-body problem, the binding energy of the ground state is\nsignificantly suppressed, and by introducing a closed-channel Fermi sea to the\nmany-body problem, we can drive the system towards weaker fermion pairing.\nThese results are potentially relevant to superconductivity in solid-state\nmultiband materials, as well as to the current and continuing exploration of\nunconventional Fermi-gas superfluids near the OFR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 05:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}

This is due to the ambiguity of GAN-based inpainting models:\nthese models can generate many possible restorations given a missing region. To\naddress this limitation, our key insight is that semantically interpretable\ninformation (such as attribute and segmentation information) of input images\n(with missing regions) can provide essential guidance for the inpainting\nprocess.

We characterize a photo-lithographic pinhole\nmask and explore the systematic errors that result from different experimental\nsetups. We characterized the nonlinear geometric distortion of a simple imaging\nsystem using the mask; and we measured 857 nm RMS of optical distortion with a\nfinal residual of 39 nm (equivalent to 20 {\\mu}as for TMT). We use a sixth\norder bivariate Legendre polynomial to model the optical distortion and allow\nthe reference positions of the individual pinholes to vary.

The CIR, a function\nof intensity of light within the central 1.5 and 3 arcsec region, is found to\nbe a vital parameter in galaxy evolution, as it shares strong correlations with\nmany structural and dynamical properties of early-type galaxies, including mass\nof the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). We use archival HST images for\naperture photometry at the centre of the galaxy image to compute the CIR. We\nobserve that the relative sizes of nuclear rings and ring cluster surface\ndensities strongly correlate with the CIR. These correlations suggest reduced\nstar formation in the centres of galaxies hosting small and dense nuclear\nrings. This scenario appears to be a consequence of strong bars as advocated by\nthe significant connection observed between the CIR and bar strengths. In\naddition, we observe that the CIR is closely related with the integrated\nproperties of the stellar population in the nuclear rings associating the rings\nhosting older and less massive star clusters with low values of CIR. Thus, the\nCIR can serve as a crucial parameter in unfolding the coupled evolution of bars\nand rings as it is intimately connected with both their properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 06:49:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

Previous studies on evaluations of parameterization schemes\nof soil thermal conductivity are mostly based on specific experimental\nconditions or local soil samples, and their recommendations may not be the\noptimal schemes for land surface model (LSMs). In this work, seven highly\nrecommended soil thermal conductivity schemes are evaluated for their\napplicability in LSMs. With the consideration of both scheme estimations and\nland process simulations by incorporation into the Common Land Model, the\nBalland and Arp [2005] scheme is found to consistently perform best among all\nthe schemes, and thus can be recommended as a superior scheme for land modeling\nuse. Uncertainty analyses by in-situ simulations demonstrate that, over\nrelatively dry regions, the inter-scheme variations of soil thermal\nconductivity can lead to significant differences of simulated soil temperature,\nespecially at deep layers, due to changes of downward soil heat conduction and\nthe associated freeze-thaw cycles. However, few effects appear over wet\nregions, likely due to the high soil heat capacity induced by high soil\nmoisture levels, which increases the heat inertia in soil thermodynamics.\nGlobal comparisons show the similar relationships that soil thermal\nconductivity significantly affects the simulated soil temperature and other\nrelated thermal and hydraulic variables over arid and semi-arid regions in mid-\nand high-latitudes. These results display the role of soil thermal conductivity\nin LSM, and suggest the importance of the evaluation and further development of\nthermal conductivity schemes with respect to land modelling applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 11:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

Most companions will be cooler and less massive than\ntheir host star. Their lower mass leads to faster orbital velocities, and thus\na potentially larger beaming effect. The lower temperature will mean that most\nof their light is emitted at longer wavelengths, where the relative photometric\ndominance of the primary is reduced. Thus for some systems, the secondary\ncompanion can be the main contributor to observed relativistic beaming signals\nat long wavelengths. Furthermore, if the system is observed over a range of\nwavelengths we can independently constrain the temperature of the companion,\nand the mass and radius ratio of the binary.

Here, we present a novel\napproach for estimating the influence of fast chaotic rotation on the orbital\nevolution of high-eccentricity triaxial asteroids, and formally characterize\nthe propagation of their angular rotation velocities and orbital elements as\nrandom time processes. By employing the impulse approximation, we demonstrate\nthat the violent gravitational interactions during periastron passages transfer\nenergy between the orbit and asteroid's rotation. If the distribution of spin\nimpulses were symmetric around zero, then the net result would be a secular\ndecrease of the semimajor axis and a further increase of the eccentricity.

However, current measurements of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, show a\nsignificant tension ($\\sim 4-6\\sigma$) between early- and late-Universe\nobservations. There are ongoing efforts to check the diverse observational\nresults and also to investigate possible theoretical ways to resolve the\ntension~-- which could point to radical extensions of the standard model. Here\nwe demonstrate the potential of next-generation spectroscopic galaxy surveys to\nshed light on the Hubble constant tension. Surveys such as those with Euclid\nand the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are expected to reach sub-percent\nprecision on Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements of the Hubble\nparameter, with a combined redshift coverage of $0.1<z<3$. This wide redshift\nrange, together with the high precision and low level of systematics in BAO\nmeasurements, mean that these surveys will provide independent and tight\nconstraints on $H(z)$. These $H(z)$ measurements can be extrapolated to $z = 0$\nto provide constraints on $H_0$ using a non-parametric regression. To this end\nwe deploy Gaussian processes and we find that Euclid-like surveys can reach\n$\\sim$3\\% precision on $H_0$, with SKA-like intensity mapping surveys reaching\n$\\sim$2\\%. When we combine the low-redshift SKA-like Band 2 survey with either\nits high-redshift Band 1 counterpart, or with the non-overlapping Euclid-like\nsurvey, the precision is predicted to be close to 1\\% with 40 $H(z)$ data\npoints. This would be sufficient to rule out the current early- or\nlate-Universe measurements at a $\\sim$5$\\sigma$ level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 13:02:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 16:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

Recently, there has been increasing\ninterest in whether or not the intermediate representations offered by these\nmodules may be used to explain the reasoning for a model's prediction, and\nconsequently reach insights regarding the model's decision-making process. A\nrecent paper claims that `Attention is not Explanation' (Jain and Wallace,\n2019). We challenge many of the assumptions underlying this work, arguing that\nsuch a claim depends on one's definition of explanation, and that testing it\nneeds to take into account all elements of the model, using a rigorous\nexperimental design. We propose four alternative tests to determine\nwhen/whether attention can be used as explanation: a simple uniform-weights\nbaseline; a variance calibration based on multiple random seed runs; a\ndiagnostic framework using frozen weights from pretrained models; and an\nend-to-end adversarial attention training protocol. Each allows for meaningful\ninterpretation of attention mechanisms in RNN models. We show that even when\nreliable adversarial distributions can be found, they don't perform well on the\nsimple diagnostic, indicating that prior work does not disprove the usefulness\nof attention mechanisms for explainability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 13:15:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 14:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-06"}

It targets identification of\ndistinct functionalities implemented within a method. Segmentation builds upon\ndata and control dependencies among statements to extract functionalities from\ncode by successive contraction of edges in the Structure Dependence Graph\n(SDG). Three edge contractions are explored, namely structural control edge\ncontraction, exclusive data dependence edge contraction, and sequential data\ndependence edge contraction. The SDG is first constructed from the program,\nwhich is then collapsed into a segment graph that captures dependence between\nsubtasks. An intermediate representation for data and control dependencies\namong statements keeps the technique language independent. The approach is\nevaluated on four case studies, including three from the open source domain,\nand the findings are reported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 13:41:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

Matter from this disc accretes onto the neutron star, giving rise to\nthe X-ray outburst as seen in the synchronous evolution of the optical and\nX-ray lightcurves. Using data taken with OGLE we show that the circumstellar\ndisc has exhibited stable behaviour over two decades.

Occasionally,\nhowever, priors may be unrepresentative of the parameter values for a given\ndataset, which can result in inefficient parameter space exploration, or even\nincorrect inferences, particularly for nested sampling (NS) algorithms. Simply\nbroadening the prior in such cases may be inappropriate or impossible in some\napplications. Hence our previous solution to this problem, known as posterior\nrepartitioning (PR), redefines the prior and likelihood while keeping their\nproduct fixed, so that the posterior inferences and evidence estimates remain\nunchanged, but the efficiency of the NS process is significantly increased. In\nits most practical form, PR raises the prior to some power beta, which is\nintroduced as an auxiliary variable that must be determined on a case-by-case\nbasis, usually by lowering beta from unity according to some pre-defined\n`annealing schedule' until the resulting inferences converge to a consistent\nsolution. Here we present a very simple yet powerful alternative Bayesian\napproach, in which beta is instead treated as a hyperparameter that is inferred\nfrom the data alongside the original parameters of the problem, and then\nmarginalised over to obtain the final inference. We show through numerical\nexamples that this Bayesian PR (BPR) method provides a very robust,\nself-adapting and computationally efficient `hands-off' solution to the problem\nof unrepresentative priors in Bayesian inference using NS. Moreover, unlike the\noriginal PR method, we show that even for representative priors BPR has a\nnegligible computational overhead relative to standard nesting sampling, which\nsuggests that it should be used as the default in all NS analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 14:19:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 17:39:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2022 11:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-05"}

To\nbetter understand the convergence of these methods, the study of Blaschke\ndecompositions on weighted Hardy spaces was studied by Coifman and\nSteinerberger, under the assumption that the complex valued function $F$ has an\nanalytic extension to $\\mathbb{D}_{1+\\epsilon}$ for some $\\epsilon>0$. This\nprovided bounds on weighted Hardy norms involving a function and its Blaschke\ndecomposition.

Additionally, single splats were\nanalysed, showing that as the precursor travels through the flame, pyrolysis\nand sintering takes place to form the solid material. These results were used\nto derive a model of the physico-chemical transformation of the solution\nprecursor. This work proves that solution precursor thermal spray is a\npromising technique for the deposition of doped ceramic coatings, being the\nmicrostructure and phase content controllable through the spraying parameters\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 14:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

BM lesions can\npresent as punctate (1 mm) foci, requiring high-precision Magnetic Resonance\nImaging (MRI) in order to prevent inadequate or delayed BM treatment. However,\nBM lesion detection remains challenging partly due to their structural\nsimilarities to normal structures (e.g., vasculature). We propose a\nBM-detection framework using a single-sequence gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted\n3D MRI dataset. The framework focuses on detection of smaller (< 15 mm) BM\nlesions and consists of: (1) candidate-selection stage, using Laplacian of\nGaussian approach for highlighting parts of a MRI volume holding higher BM\noccurrence probabilities, and (2) detection stage that iteratively processes\ncropped region-of-interest volumes centered by candidates using a custom-built\n3D convolutional neural network (\"CropNet\"). Data is augmented extensively\nduring training via a pipeline consisting of random gamma correction and\nelastic deformation stages; the framework thereby maintains its invariance for\na plausible range of BM shape and intensity representations. This approach is\ntested using five-fold cross-validation on 217 datasets from 158 patients, with\ntraining and testing groups randomized per patient to eliminate learning bias.\nThe BM database included lesions with a mean diameter of ~5.4 mm and a mean\nvolume of ~160 mm3. For 90% BM-detection sensitivity, the framework produced on\naverage 9.12 false-positive BM detections per patient (standard deviation of\n3.49); for 85% sensitivity, the average number of false-positives declined to\n5.85. Comparative analysis showed that the framework produces comparable\nBM-detection accuracy with the state-of-art approaches validated for\nsignificantly larger lesions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 15:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

Although\nthey appear as distinct phenomena, new theories state that transitions between\nextreme waves are allowed. However, these have never been experimentally\nobserved because of the lack of control strategies. We introduce a new concept\nof nonlinear wave topological control, based on the one-to-one correspondence\nbetween the number of wave packet oscillating phases and the genus of toroidal\nsurfaces associated with the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation solutions by the\nRiemann theta function. We prove it experimentally by reporting the first\nobservation of supervised transitions between extreme waves with different\ngenera, like the continuous transition from dispersive shock to rogue waves.\nSpecifically, we use a parametric time-dependent nonlinearity to shape the\nasymptotic wave genus. We consider the box problem in a focusing Kerr-like\nphotorefractive medium and tailor time-dependent propagation coefficients, as\nnonlinearity and dispersion, to explore each region in the state-diagram and\ninclude all the dynamic phases in the nonlinear wave propagation. Our result is\nthe first example of the topological control of integrable nonlinear waves.\nThis new technique casts light on dispersive shock waves and rogue wave\ngeneration, and can be extended to other nonlinear phenomena, from classical to\nquantum ones. The outcome is not only important for fundamental studies and\ncontrol of extreme nonlinear waves, but can be also applied to spatial beam\nshaping for microscopy, medicine and spectroscopy, and to the broadband\ncoherent light generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 21:45:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 12:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-12"}

In all these models our goal is to understand under which\nconditions users situated far away from each other can communicate. This is the\nfundamental question of continuum percolation, which was introduced by Gilbert\n(1961), who established the Boolean model for Poisson point processes. In the\nfirst part of this thesis we introduce this model and prove the existence of a\nphase transition between a subcritical phase, where no infinite connected\ncomponent of users exists, and a supercritical phase, where such a component\nexists. We also consider the case of random connection radii, following Meester\nand Roy (1996). In the second part we study the SINR model for Cox point\nprocesses in two or higher dimensions, following T\\'obi\\'as (2019). He proved\nthat there exists a phase transition under certain stabilization and\nconnectedness conditions on the intensity measure. The SINR model for\nhomogeneous Poisson point processes in $\\mathbb R^2$ was introduced by Dousse\net al. (2005). In the third part we study percolation in the SINR model with\nrandom powers for Poisson point processes in $\\mathbb R^d$, $d \\geq 2$.

In this thesis we weaken these conditions and\nonly assume that the random power is nonnegative, integrable and not a.s. zero.\nWe show that there exists a subcritical phase if the path-loss function decays\nfast enough.

This enables the buyer to easily locate the item they are\nlooking for and also to explore various items available under a category.\nProduct taxonomy is a tree structure with 3 or more levels of depth and several\nleaf nodes. Product categorization is a large scale classification task that\nassigns a category path to a particular product. Research in this area is\nrestricted by the unavailability of good real-world datasets and the variations\nin taxonomy due to the absence of a standard across the different e-commerce\nstores. In this paper, we introduce a high-quality product taxonomy dataset\nfocusing on clothing products which contain 186,150 images under clothing\ncategory with 3 levels and 52 leaf nodes in the taxonomy. We explain the\nmethodology used to collect and label this dataset. Further, we establish the\nbenchmark by comparing image classification and Attention based Sequence models\nfor predicting the category path. Our benchmark model reaches a micro f-score\nof 0.92 on the test set. The dataset, code and pre-trained models are publicly\navailable at \\url{https://github.com/vumaasha/atlas}. We invite the community\nto improve upon these baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 16:46:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

The diversity of these modules and complexity of\nexecution paths, the massive scale and complex hierarchy of datacenter\ninfrastructure, the confidential issues of data sets and workloads pose great\nchallenges to benchmarking. In this paper, we present the first\nindustry-standard Internet service AI benchmark suite---AIBench with seventeen\nindustry partners, including several top Internet service providers. AIBench\nprovides a highly extensible, configurable, and flexible benchmark framework\nthat contains loosely coupled modules. We identify sixteen prominent AI problem\ndomains like learning to rank, each of which forms an AI component benchmark,\nfrom three most important Internet service domains: search engine, social\nnetwork, and e-commerce, which is by far the most comprehensive AI benchmarking\neffort. On the basis of the AIBench framework, abstracting the real-world data\nsets and workloads from one of the top e-commerce providers, we design and\nimplement the first end-to-end Internet service AI benchmark, which contains\nthe primary modules in the critical paths of an industry scale application and\nis scalable to deploy on different cluster scales.

This method\nrelies on the theory of isospectral matrix reductions to compute the\nprobability of eventually transitioning from one vertex to another in a\n(biased) random walk on the network. Unlike the large majority of link\nprediction techniques, this method can be used to predict links in networks\nthat are directed or undirected which are either weighted or unweighted. We\napply this method to a number of social, technological, and natural networks\nand show that it is competitive with other link predictors often outperforming\nthem. We also provide a method of approximating our effective transition method\nand show that aside from having much lower temporal complexity, this\napproximation often provides more accurate predictions than the original\neffective transition method. We also, prove a number of mathematical results\nregarding our effective transition algorithm and its approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 23:32:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}
