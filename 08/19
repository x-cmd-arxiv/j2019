We explore one possible\nstrategy based on the modification of nanojunction symmetry which can be\nrealized, for example, by a mechanical strain. Such modification can activate\nnew molecular orbitals which were inactive before due to their orbital mismatch\nwith the electrode's conduction states. This can result in several important\nconsequences such as (i) quantum interference effects appearing as Fano-like\nfeatures in electron transmission and (ii) the change in molecular level\nhybridization with the electrode's states. We argue that the symmetry change\ncan affect very differently two majority- and minority-spin conductances and\nthus alter significantly the resulting spin-filtering ratio as the junction\nsymmetry is modified. We illustrate the idea for two basic molecular junctions:\nNi/benzene/Ni (perpendicular vs tilted orientations) and Ni/Si chain/Ni (zigzag\nvs linear chains). In both cases, one highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)\nand one lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (out of HOMO and LUMO\ndoublets) are important. In particular, their destructive interference with\nother orbitals leads to dramatic suppression of majority-spin conductance in\nlow-symmetry configurations. For a minority-spin channel, on the contrary, the\nconductance is strongly enhanced when the symmetry is lowered due to an\nincrease in hybridization strength. We believe that our results may offer a\npotential route for creating molecular devices with a large on-off ratio of\nspin polarization via quantum interference effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Aug 2019 16:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

In recent years,\nmulti-FPGA platforms have gained traction in data centers as low-cost yet\nhigh-performance solutions particularly as acceleration engines, thanks to the\nhigh degree of parallelism they provide. Nonetheless, the size of data centers\nworkloads varies during service time, leading to significant underutilization\nof computing resources while consuming a large amount of power, which turns out\nas a key factor of data center inefficiency, regardless of the underlying\nhardware structure.

This leads to neglect the horizontal projection of the rotation\nvector in the equations for the dynamics of gravito-inertial waves (GIWs) that\nbecome separable as in the non-rotating case while they are not in the case\nwith the full Coriolis acceleration. This approximation has been broadly\napplied in stellar (and planetary) astrophysics to study low-frequency GIWs.\nTAR is built on the assumptions that the star is spherical (i.e. its\ncentrifugal deformation is neglected) and uniformly rotating while an adiabatic\ntreatment of the dynamics of the waves is adopted. However, it has been\nrecently generalised with including the effects of a differential rotation. We\naim to do a new generalisation that takes into account the centrifugal\nacceleration in the case of moderately uniformly rotating deformed stars. As in\nthe case of a differentially rotating spherical star, the problem becomes 2D\nbut can be treated analytically if assuming the Cowling, anelastic and JWKB\napproximations, which are relevant for low-frequency GIWs. It allows us to\nderive a generalised Laplace tidal equation for the horizontal eigenfunctions\nand asymptotic wave periods that can be used to probe the structure and\ndynamics of rotating deformed stars thanks to asteroseismology. A first\nnumerical exploration of its eigenvalues and horizontal eigenfunctions shows\ntheir variation as a function of the pseudo-radius for different rotation rates\nand frequencies and the development of avoided crossings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Aug 2019 22:12:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

We organize the 100 networks in terms of\ntheir properties to get a better understanding of the embedding performance of\nthese popular methods. We use the comparisons on our 100 benchmark graphs to\ndefine GFS-score, that can be applied to any embedding method to quantify its\nperformance. We rank the state-of-the-art embedding approaches using the\nGFS-score and show that it can be used to understand and evaluate novel\nembedding approaches. We envision that the proposed framework\n(https://www.github.com/palash1992/GEM-Benchmark) will serve the community as a\nbenchmarking platform to test and compare the performance of future graph\nembedding techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 00:19:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 21:20:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 22:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

The spectrum in the central\nregion can be also fitted with a two-component model: a two-temperature plasma\nmodel in a collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) with temperatures of 7.9\nkeV and >34 keV or a CIE+power law model with a temperature of 9.4 keV and a\nphoton index of 1.1. The two component models can represent the intensity ratio\nof Fe XXVI Ly alpha/Fe XXV He alpha lines. On the other hand, the spectrum in\nthe outer region (r>300'') can be explained by a single CIE plasma model with a\ntemperature of 5-8 keV. Based on the spectral feature and its circular\nstructure, we propose that the NEI plasma was produced by merging along the\nline-of-sight direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 02:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

However, such issues could be alleviated if knowledge from a\nmuch denser and a related secondary domain could be used to enhance the\nrecommendation accuracy in the sparse target domain.

We seek a minimizer of this cost subject to a set of affine\nequality constraints, and a set of affine inequality constraints specifying the\nbounds on the decision variables if such bounds exist. We design our\ndistributed algorithm in a cluster-based framework which results in a\nsignificant reduction in communication and computation costs. Our proposed\ndistributed solution is a novel continuous-time algorithm that is linked to the\naugmented Lagrangian approach. It converges asymptotically when the local cost\nfunctions are convex and exponentially when they are strongly convex and have\nLipschitz gradients. Moreover, we use an $\\epsilon$-exact penalty function to\naddress the inequality constraints and derive an explicit lower bound on the\npenalty function weight to guarantee convergence to $\\epsilon$-neighborhood of\nthe global minimum value of the cost. A numerical example demonstrates our\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 08:14:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2020 22:47:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:24:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 22:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

Consequently, many teenagers exclude computing as a career path.\nIn this research study, we present two promising concepts to overcome these\nchallenges. First, we consider alternative paths to enter the field of CS. In\n2018, a voluntary lecture \"Design your own app\" at the University of Graz for\nstudents of all degree programs was introduced.

The course received positive evaluations and led to our second\nconcept; In January 2019, we started to design a MOOC (Massive Open Online\nCourse) with the title \"Get FIT in Computer Science\". First, this course can be\nused to encourage young women who have little to no previous knowledge in CS.\nSecond, it should help all teenagers to get a more realistic picture of CS to\nits basic concepts. Third, teachers can use the course materials to lead high\nschool classes (Open Educational Resources).

Here we establish cross-property\nrelations for two-phase composite media that link effective elastic and\nelectromagnetic wave characteristics to one another, including the respective\neffective wave speeds and attenuation coefficients, which facilitate\nmultifunctional material design. This is achieved by deriving accurate formulas\nfor the effective electromagnetic and elastodynamic properties that depend on\nthe wavelengths of the incident waves and the microstructure via the spectral\ndensity. Our formulas enable us to explore the wave characteristics of a broad\nclass of disordered microstructures because they apply, unlike conventional\nformulas, for a wide range of incident wavelengths, i.e., well beyond the\nlong-wavelength regime. This capability enables us to study the dynamic\nproperties of exotic disordered ``hyperuniform'' composites that can have\nadvantages over crystalline ones, such as nearly optimal, direction-independent\nproperties and robustness against defects. We specifically show that disordered\n``stealthy'' hyperuniform microstructures exhibit novel wave characteristics,\ne.g., low-pass filters that transmit waves ``isotropically'' up to a finite\nwavenumber. Our cross-property relations for the effective wave characteristics\ncan be applied to design multifunctional composites via inverse techniques.\nDesign examples include structural components that require high stiffness and\nelectromagnetic absorption, heat-sinks for CPUs, and sound-absorbing housings\nfor motors that have to efficiently emit thermal radiation and suppress\nmechanical vibrations, and nondestructive evaluation of the elastic moduli of\nmaterials from the effective dielectric response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 09:32:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 21:24:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 00:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

However, object detection in real world is still\nchallenging due to the serious data imbalance. Images in real world are\ndominated by easy samples like the wide range of background and some easily\nrecognizable objects, for example. Although two-stage detectors like Faster\nR-CNN achieved big successes in object detection due to the strategy of\nextracting region proposals by region proposal network, they show their poor\nadaption in real-world object detection as a result of without considering\nmining hard samples during extracting region proposals. To address this issue,\nwe propose a Cascade framework of Region Proposal Networks, referred to as\nC-RPNs. The essence of C-RPNs is adopting multiple stages to mine hard samples\nwhile extracting region proposals and learn stronger classifiers. Meanwhile, a\nfeature chain and a score chain are proposed to help learning more\ndiscriminative representations for proposals. Moreover, a loss function of\ncascade stages is designed to train cascade classifiers through\nbackpropagation. Our proposed method has been evaluated on Pascal VOC and\nseveral challenging datasets like BSBDV 2017, CityPersons, etc. Our method\nachieves competitive results compared with the current state-of-the-arts and\nall-sided improvements in error analysis, validating its efficacy for detection\nin real world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 09:37:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

Recently, simultaneous field and\nparticle observations have indeed revealed enhanced whistler-like fluctuations\nin the presence of counter-beaming populations of electrons, connecting these\nfluctuations to the whistler heat-flux instability (WHFI). This instability is\npredicted only for limited conditions of electron beam-plasmas, and was not\ncaptured in numerical simulations yet. In this letter we report the first\nsimulations of WHFI in particle-in-cell (PIC) setups, realistic for the solar\nwind conditions, and without temperature gradients or anisotropies to trigger\nthe instability in the initiation phase. The velocity distributions have a\ncomplex reaction to the enhanced whistler fluctuations conditioning the\ninstability saturation by a decrease of the relative drifts combined with\ninduced (effective) temperature anisotropies (heating the core electrons and\npitch-angle and energy scattering the strahl). These results are in good\nagreement with a recent quasilinear approach, and support therefore a largely\naccepted belief that WHFI saturates at moderate amplitudes. In anti-sunward\ndirection the strahl becomes skewed with a pitch-angle distribution decreasing\nin width as electron energy increases, that seems to be characteristic to\nself-generated whistlers and not to small-scale turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 09:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-05"}

However,\ndue to the sensor noise, high redundancy, incompleteness, and complexity of\nairborne LiDAR systems, point cloud classification is challenging. In this\npaper, we proposed a directionally constrained fully convolutional neural\nnetwork (D-FCN) that can take the original 3D coordinates and LiDAR intensity\nas input; thus, it can directly apply to unstructured 3D point clouds for\nsemantic labeling. Specifically, we first introduce a novel directionally\nconstrained point convolution (D-Conv) module to extract locally representative\nfeatures of 3D point sets from the projected 2D receptive fields. To make full\nuse of the orientation information of neighborhood points, the proposed D-Conv\nmodule performs convolution in an orientation-aware manner by using a\ndirectionally constrained nearest neighborhood search. Then, we designed a\nmultiscale fully convolutional neural network with downsampling and upsampling\nblocks to enable multiscale point feature learning. The proposed D-FCN model\ncan therefore process input point cloud with arbitrary sizes and directly\npredict the semantic labels for all the input points in an end-to-end manner.\nWithout involving additional geometry features as input, the proposed method\nhas demonstrated superior performance on the International Society for\nPhotogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) 3D labeling benchmark dataset.

The exact nature of this dark matter\n(e.g., stellar dark remnants or diffuse dark matter) is unknown. This article\nassumes it to be an scalar field of toroidal distribution, associated with\nultra-light dark matter particles, surrounding the Kerr black hole. Such a\nfield is a form of \"hair\" expected in the context of superradiance, a mechanism\nthat extracts rotational energy from the black hole. Orbital signatures for the\nS2 star are computed and shown to be detectable by GRAVITY. The scalar field\ncan be constrained because the variation of orbital elements depends both on\nthe relative mass of the scalar field to the black hole and on the field mass\ncoupling parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 10:13:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 16:47:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

Its\nexcellent performance mainly benefit from the three-step training mechanism,\nthat are: (1) acquiring object features on the base dataset (i.e. ImageNet),\n(2) training the parent network on the training set of the target dataset (i.e.\nDAVIS-2016) to be capable of differentiating the object of interest from the\nbackground.

These improvements not only make REFCMFS efficiently obtain\nmore promising performance but also provide a new tractable and skillful\noptimization method to solve the problem embedded the $L_0$-norm constraint.\nTheoretical analyses and extensive experiments on several public datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our proposed REFCMFS method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 11:17:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 02:24:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2019 03:02:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 02:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-06"}

Similarly, spectral\ndecompositions (pure point, absolutely continuous and singular continuous)\noften characterise relevant physical properties such as long-time dynamics of\nquantum systems. Despite new results on computing spectra, there remains no\ngeneral method able to compute spectral measures or spectral decompositions of\ninfinite-dimensional normal operators. Previous efforts focus on specific\nexamples where analytical formulae are available (or perturbations thereof) or\non classes of operators with a lot of structure. Hence the general\ncomputational problem is predominantly open. We solve this problem by providing\nthe first set of general algorithms that compute spectral measures and\ndecompositions of a wide class of operators. Given a matrix representation of a\nself-adjoint or unitary operator, such that each column decays at infinity at a\nknown asymptotic rate, we show how to compute spectral measures and\ndecompositions. We discuss how these methods allow the computation of objects\nsuch as the functional calculus, and how they generalise to a large class of\npartial differential operators, allowing, for example, solutions to evolution\nPDEs such as Schr\\\"odinger equations on $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^d)$.

The goal is to\ncompare a globally optimal solution to an optimal clustered solution, under\ncertain constraints on the coloring provided with the input. We show close\nbounds on the worst-case ratio between these two costs, called \"the price of\nclustering\", improving and simplifying previous results. Specifically, we show\nthat the price of clustering does not exceed 1.93667, improving over the\nprevious upper bound of 1.951, and that it is at least 1.93558, improving over\nthe previous lower bound of 1.93344.\n  In online bin packing with delays, items are presented over time.

Many examples studied\nin the literature fit into these definitions, in particular the works on\ncristal growth started by S. Ulam in the 60s. The central question addressed\nhere is how the computational power and computational hardness of basic\nproperties is affected by the constraints of convergence, bounded number of\nchange, or local decreasing of states in each cell. By studying various\nbenchmark problems (short-term prediction, long term reachability, limits) and\nconsidering various complexity measures and scales (LOGSPACE vs. PTIME,\ncommunication complexity, Turing computability and arithmetical hierarchy) we\ngive a rich and nuanced answer: the overall computational complexity of such\ncellular automata depends on the class considered (among the three above), the\ndimension, and the precise problem studied. In particular, we show that all\nsettings can achieve universality in the sense of Blondel-Delvenne-K\\r{u}rka,\nalthough short term predictability varies from NLOGSPACE to P-complete.\nBesides, the computability of limit configurations starting from computable\ninitial configurations separates bounded-change from convergent cellular\nautomata in dimension~1, but also dimension~1 versus higher dimensions for\nfreezing cellular automata. Another surprising dimension-sensitive result\nobtained is that nilpotency becomes decidable in dimension~ 1 for all the three\nclasses, while it stays undecidable even for freezing cellular automata in\nhigher dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 12:39:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 09:05:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 07:55:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 10:02:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-27"}

In particular, it is\npossible to measure at the percent level masses and radii of both components of\na double-lined spectroscopic EB. Since the advent of high-precision photometric\nspace missions (MOST, CoRoT, Kepler, BRITE, TESS), the use of stellar pulsation\nproperties to infer stellar interiors and dynamics constitutes a revolution for\nlow-mass star studies. The Kepler mission has led to the discovery of thousands\nof classical pulsators such as $\\delta$ Scuti and solar-like oscillators (main\nsequence and evolved), but also almost 3000 EBs with orbital periods shorter\nthan 1100 days. We report the first systematic search for stellar pulsators in\nthe entire Kepler eclipsing binary catalog. The focus is mainly aimed at\ndiscovering $\\delta$ Scuti, $\\gamma$ Doradus, red giant, and tidally excited\npulsators. We developed a data inspection tool (DIT) that automatically\nproduces a series of plots from the Kepler light-curves that allows us to\nvisually identify whether stellar oscillations are present in a given time\nseries. We applied the DIT to the whole Kepler eclipsing binary database and\nidentified 303 systems whose light curves display oscillations, including 163\nnew discoveries.

This is related to unweighted graphs. This paper also presents a new\nfast all-pairs shortest path algorithm for weighted graph based on the same\nidea. In Dijkstra algorithm which is said to be fast in weighted graphs, the\naverage number of accesses to adjacent vertices (expressed by {\\alpha}) is\nabout equal to the average degree of the graph. On the other hand, our\nalgorithm utilizes the shortest path trees of adjacent vertices of each source\nvertex in the same manner as the algorithm for unweighted graphs, and reduce\n{\\alpha} drastically in comparison with Dijkstra algorithm. Roughly speaking\n{\\alpha} is reduced to the value close to 1, because the average degree of a\ntree is about 2, and one is used to come in and the other is used to go out,\nalthough that does not hold true when the depth of the short path trees is\nsmall. In case of weighted graphs, a problem which does not occur in unweighted\ngraphs occurs. It is waiting for the generation of the shortest path tree of an\nadjacent vertex. Therefore, it is possible that a deadlock occurs. We prove our\nalgorithm is deadlock-free. We compared our algorithm with Dijkstra and Peng\nalgorithms.

Theoretical models predict that these planets are more\nvulnerable to atmospheric loss than their counterparts orbiting Sun-like stars.\nTo determine whether a thick atmosphere has survived on a small planet, one\napproach is to search for signatures of atmospheric heat redistribution in its\nthermal phase curve. Previous phase curve observations of the super-Earth 55\nCancri e (1.9 Earth radii) showed that its peak brightness is offset from the\nsubstellar point $-$ possibly indicative of atmospheric circulation.

The extremal properties of these processes are of considerable\ninterest for market risk management. For the simplest GARCH(p,q) process, with\nmax(p,q) = 1, all extremal features have been fully characterised. Although the\nmarginal features of extreme values of the process have been theoretically\ncharacterised when max(p, q) >= 2, much remains to be found about both marginal\nand dependence structure during extreme excursions. Specifically, a reliable\nmethod is required for evaluating the tail index, which regulates the marginal\ntail behaviour and there is a need for methods and algorithms for determining\nclustering. In particular, for the latter, the mean number of extreme values in\na short-term cluster, i.e., the reciprocal of the extremal index, has only been\ncharacterised in special cases which exclude all GARCH(p,q) processes that are\nused in practice. Although recent research has identified the multivariate\nregular variation property of stationary GARCH(p,q) processes, currently there\nare no reliable methods for numerically evaluating key components of these\ncharacterisations.

In this paper, we aim to develop an automated and effective technique\nfor fence removal and image reconstruction using conditional Generative\nAdversarial Networks (cGANs). These networks have been successfully applied in\nseveral domains of Computer Vision focusing on image generation and rendering.\nOur initial approach is based on a two-stage architecture involving two cGANs\nthat generate the fence mask and the inpainted image, respectively. Training of\nthese networks is carried out independently and, during evaluation, the input\nimage is passed through the two generators in succession to obtain the\nde-fenced image. The results obtained from this approach are satisfactory, but\nthe response time is long since the image has to pass through two sets of\nconvolution layers. To reduce the response time, we propose a second approach\ninvolving only a single cGAN architecture that is trained using the\nground-truth of fenced de-fenced image pairs along with the edge map of the\nfenced image produced by the Canny Filter. Incorporation of the edge map helps\nthe network to precisely detect the edges present in the input image, and also\nimparts it an ability to carry out high quality de-fencing in an efficient\nmanner, even in the presence of a fewer number of layers as compared to the\ntwo-stage network.

Due to its simplicity, finite\ndifference methods are used extensively for this analysis in the study of\nstochastically modeled reaction networks. Different coupling methods have been\nproposed to build finite difference estimators, with the \"split coupling,\" also\ntermed the \"stacked coupling,\" yielding the lowest variance in the vast\nmajority of cases. Analytical results related to this coupling are sparse, and\ninclude an analysis of the variance of the coupled processes under the\nassumption of globally Lipschitz intensity functions [Anderson, SIAM Numerical\nAnalysis, Vol. 50, 2012]. Because of the global Lipschitz assumption utilized\nin [Anderson, SIAM Numerical Analysis, Vol. 50, 2012], the main result there is\nonly applicable to a small percentage of the models found in the literature,\nand it was conjectured that similar results should hold for a much wider class\nof models. In this paper we demonstrate this conjecture to be true by proving\nthe variance of the coupled processes scales in the desired manner for a large\nclass of non-Lipschitz models. We further extend the analysis to allow for time\ndependence in the parameters. In particular, binary systems with or without\ntime-dependent rate parameters, a class of models that accounts for the vast\nmajority of systems considered in the literature, satisfy the assumptions of\nour theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 15:32:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 16:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-03"}

Automated neural\narchitecture design is able to overcome these problems, but the most successful\nalgorithms operate on significantly constrained design spaces, assuming the\ntarget network to consist of identical repeating blocks. While such approach\nallows for faster search, it does so at the cost of expressivity.

The classical method of training CNNs is by labeling\nimages in a supervised manner as in \"input image belongs to this label\"\n(Positive Learning; PL), which is a fast and accurate method if the labels are\nassigned correctly to all images. However, if inaccurate labels, or noisy\nlabels, exist, training with PL will provide wrong information, thus severely\ndegrading performance. To address this issue, we start with an indirect\nlearning method called Negative Learning (NL), in which the CNNs are trained\nusing a complementary label as in \"input image does not belong to this\ncomplementary label.\" Because the chances of selecting a true label as a\ncomplementary label are low, NL decreases the risk of providing incorrect\ninformation. Furthermore, to improve convergence, we extend our method by\nadopting PL selectively, termed as Selective Negative Learning and Positive\nLearning (SelNLPL). PL is used selectively to train upon expected-to-be-clean\ndata, whose choices become possible as NL progresses, thus resulting in\nsuperior performance of filtering out noisy data.

Zero-shot hashing (ZSH) aims to learn a hashing\nmodel that is trained using only samples from seen categories, but can\ngeneralize well to samples of unseen categories. ZSH generally uses category\nattributes to seek a semantic embedding space to transfer knowledge from seen\ncategories to unseen ones. As a result, it may perform poorly when labeled data\nare insufficient. ZSH methods are mainly designed for single-modality data,\nwhich prevents their application to the widely spread multi-modal data. On the\nother hand, existing cross-modal hashing solutions assume that all the\nmodalities share the same category labels, while in practice the labels of\ndifferent data modalities may be different. To address these issues, we propose\na general Cross-modal Zero-shot Hashing (CZHash) solution to effectively\nleverage unlabeled and labeled multi-modality data with different label spaces.\nCZHash first quantifies the composite similarity between instances using label\nand feature information. It then defines an objective function to achieve deep\nfeature learning compatible with the composite similarity preserving, category\nattribute space learning, and hashing coding function learning.

The key construction at the heart\nof our framework is an Euler transformation which converts a 2-dimensional cell\ncomplex K into a new 2-complex K^ such that every vertex in the 1-skeleton G^\nof K^ has even degree. Hence G^ is Eulerian, and a Eulerian tour can be\nfollowed to print all edges in a continuous fashion. We start with a mesh K of\nthe union of polygons obtained by projecting all layers to the plane. We\ncompute its Euler transformation K^. In the slicing step, we clip K^ at each\nlayer using its polygon to obtain a complex that may not necessarily be Euler.\nWe then patch this complex by adding edges such that any odd-degree nodes\ncreated by slicing are transformed to have even degrees again. We print extra\nsupport edges in place of any segments left out to ensure there are no edges\nwithout support in the next layer. These support edges maintain the Euler\nnature of the complex. Finally we describe a tree-based search algorithm that\nbuilds the continuous tool path by traversing \"concentric\" cycles in the Euler\ncomplex. Our algorithm produces a tool path that avoids material collisions and\ncrossovers, and can be printed in a continuous fashion irrespective of complex\ngeometry or topology of the domain (e.g., holes). We implement our test our\nframework on several 3D objects. Apart from standard geometric shapes, we\ndemonstrate the framework on the Stanford bunny.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 01:40:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 00:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

The most prominent aspect of the first-order DPL model is\nthe prediction of wave-like temperature propagation, the detection of which\nstill remains elusive. Among the challenges to make further progress is the\ncapability to disentangle the intertwining of the parameters affecting\nwave-like behaviour. This work contributes to the quest, providing a\nstraightforward, easy-to-adopt, analytical mean to inspect the optimal\nconditions to observe temperature wave oscillations. The complex-valued\ndispersion relation for the temperature scalar field is investigated for the\ncase of a localised temperature pulse in space, and for the case of a forced\ntemperature oscillation in time. A modal quality factor is introduced showing\nthat, for the case of the temperature gradient preceding the heat flux, the\nmaterial acts as a bandpass filter for the temperature wave. The bandpass\nfilter characteristics are accessed in terms of the relevant delay times\nentering the DPL model. The optimal region in parameters space is discussed in\na variety of systems, covering nine and twelve decades in space and time-scale\nrespectively.

One of the\nfirst steps in chaotic system research is the detection of chaos. The largest\nLyapunov exponent (LLE) is one of the most widely used techniques for this\npurpose. Recently, techniques for calculating LLE have been developed taking\ninto account the error due to the finite precision of computers. Recursive\nmethods were employed to improve such algorithms. However, this method\nuniformly weighed the data used to calculate the LLE. This paper investigates\nthe different weighing of the data based on the hypothesis that the initial\ndata have a higher precision than the last data processed by the algorithm,\nsince the process is subject to error accumulation. In five tested systems, the\nproposed method obtained more accurate results in three. However, there was an\nincrease in the variance of the result obtained for two of the evaluated\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 13:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-29"}

Besides specifying and verifying\nparametric systems, we consider the aspect of dynamic reconfiguration, in which\ncomponents can migrate at runtime on a physical map, whose shape and size may\nchange. We describe such parametric and reconfigurable architectures using\nresource logics, close in spirit to Separation Logic, used to reason about\ndynamic pointer structures. These logics support the principle of local\nreasoning, which is the key for writing modular specifications and building\nscalable verification algorithms, that deal with large industrial-size systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 13:06:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-30"}
