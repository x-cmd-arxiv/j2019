We use first-principles calculations to investigate the limitations to\nits transparency due to free-carrier absorption mediated by phonons or charged\ndefects. We find that the main contribution to the phonon-assisted indirect\nabsorption is due to emission (as opposed to absorption) of phonons, which\nexplains why the process is relatively insensitive to temperature. The\nwavelength dependence of this indirect absorption process can be described by a\npower law. Indirect absorption mediated by charged defects or impurities is\nalso unavoidable since doping is required to obtain conductivity. At high\ncarrier concentrations, screening by the free carriers becomes important. We\nfind that charged-impurity-assisted absorption becomes larger than\nphonon-assisted absorption for impurity concentrations above 10$^{20}$\ncm$^{-3}$. The differences in the photon-energy dependence of the two processes\ncan be explained by band-structure effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 16:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-27"}

First, images from each domain are embedded into two\nspaces, a shared domain-invariant content space and a domain-specific style\nspace. Next, the representation in the content space is extracted to perform a\ntask.

The proof is based on a\nsimple isodiametric variance bound which characterizes regular simplices: it\nshows that among probability measures on ${\\mathbf R}^n$ whose supports have at\nmost unit diameter, the variance around the mean is maximized precisely by\nthose measures which assign mass $1/(n+1)$ to each vertex of a (unit-diameter)\nregular simplex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 16:51:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 20:51:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Feb 2020 23:24:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 21:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

There are two main challenges for close proximity flights: (i)\nthe trust characteristics varies drastically for the different distance from\nthe ceiling which results in a complex nonlinear dynamics; (ii) the system\nneeds to consider physical and environmental constraints to safely fly in close\nproximity. To address these challenges, a novel framework consisting of a\nconstrained optimization-based force estimation and an optimization-based\nnonlinear controller is proposed. Experimental results illustrate that the\nperformance of the proposed control approach can stabilize UAV down to 1 cm\ndistance to the ceiling. Furthermore, we report that the UAV consumes up to\n12.5% less power when it is operated 1 cm distance to ceiling, which is\npromising potential for more battery-efficient inspection flights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 16:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-01"}

Therefore,\nunderstanding the processes that can trigger this dissipation is key to the\ncharacterization of the energy budgets and particle acceleration mechanisms at\naction in active galaxies. Instabilities and entrainment are two obvious\ncandidates to trigger dissipation. On the one hand, supersonic, relativistic\nflows threaded by helical fields, as expected from the standard formation\nmodels of jets in supermassive black-holes, are unstable to a series of\nmagnetohydrodynamical instabilities, such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz,\ncurrent-driven, or possibly the pressure-driven instabilities. Furthermore, in\nthe case of expanding jets, the Rayleigh-Taylor and centrifugal instabilities\nmay also develop. With all these destabilizing processes at action, a natural\nquestion is how can some jets keep their collimated structure along hundreds of\nkiloparsecs. On the other hand, the interaction of the jet with stars and\nclouds of gas that cross the flow in their orbits around the galactic centers\nprovides another scenario in which kinetic energy can be efficiently converted\ninto internal energy and particles can be accelerated to non-thermal energies.\nIn this contribution, I review the conditions under which these processes occur\nand their role both in jet evolution and propagation and energy dissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:03:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-01"}

Additionally, current models lack the expressive\npower needed to represent the complex non-linear geometry of pose-dependent\nclothing shapes. To address this, we learn a generative 3D mesh model of\nclothed people from 3D scans with varying pose and clothing. Specifically, we\ntrain a conditional Mesh-VAE-GAN to learn the clothing deformation from the\nSMPL body model, making clothing an additional term in SMPL. Our model is\nconditioned on both pose and clothing type, giving the ability to draw samples\nof clothing to dress different body shapes in a variety of styles and poses. To\npreserve wrinkle detail, our Mesh-VAE-GAN extends patchwise discriminators to\n3D meshes.

First, for general nonconvex functions,\nwe consider nonstationary versions of first-order and second-order stationary\nsolutions as a regret measure, motivated by similar performance measures for\noffline nonconvex optimization. In the case of second-order stationary solution\nbased regret, we propose and analyze online and bandit versions of the cubic\nregularized Newton's method. The bandit version is based on estimating the\nHessian matrices in the bandit setting, based on second-order Gaussian Stein's\nidentity. Our nonstationary regret bounds in terms of second-order stationary\nsolutions have interesting consequences for avoiding saddle points in the\nbandit setting. Next, for weakly quasi convex functions and monotone weakly\nsubmodular functions we consider nonstationary regret measures in terms of\nfunction-values; such structured classes of nonconvex functions enable one to\nconsider regret measure defined in terms of function values, similar to convex\nfunctions. For this case of function-value, and first-order stationary solution\nbased regret measures, we provide regret bounds in both the low- and\nhigh-dimensional settings, for some scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:32:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 07:06:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-12"}

To address the large\nuncertainties associated with the modelling of extra QCD radiation in ttbb\nevents, in this paper we present a calculation of pp->ttbbj at NLO QCD. The\nbehaviour of NLO corrections is analysed in a variety of observables, and to\nassess theoretical uncertainties we use factor-two rescalings as well as\ndifferent dynamic scales. In this context, we propose a systematic alignment of\ndynamic scales that makes it possible to disentangle normalisation and shape\nuncertainties in a transparent way. Scale uncertainties at NLO are typically at\nthe level of 20-30% in fiducial cross sections, and below 10% for the shapes of\ndistributions. The kinematics of QCD radiation is investigated in detail,\nincluding the effects of its recoil on the objects of the ttbb system. In\nparticular, we discuss various azimuthal correlations that allow one to\ncharaterise the QCD recoil pattern in a precise and transparent way. In\ngeneral, the calculation at hand provides a variety of precise benchmarks that\ncan be used to validate the modelling of QCD radiation in ttbb generators.\nMoreover, as we will argue, pp->ttbbj at NLO entails information that can be\nused to gain insights into the perturbative convergence of the inclusive ttbb\ncross section beyond NLO. Based on this idea, we address the issue of the large\nNLO K-factor observed in the ttbb cross section, and we provide evidence that\nsupports the reduction of this K-factor through a mild adjustment of the QCD\nscales that are conventionally used for this process.

Speaker Identification\n(SID) under noisy conditions is one of the challenging topics in the field of\nspeech processing, specifically when it comes to individuals with cochlear\nimplants (CI). This study analyzes and quantifies the ability of CI-users to\nperform speaker identification based on direct electric auditory stimuli. CI\nusers employ a limited number of frequency bands (8 to 22) and use electrodes\nto directly stimulate the Basilar Membrane/Cochlear in order to recognize the\nspeech signal. The sparsity of electric stimulation within the CI frequency\nrange is a prime reason for loss in human speech recognition, as well as SID\nperformance. Therefore, it is assumed that CI-users might be unable to\nrecognize and distinguish a speaker given dependent information such as formant\nfrequencies, pitch etc. which are lost to un-simulated electrodes. To quantify\nthis assumption, the input speech signal is processed using a CI Advanced\nCombined Encoder (ACE) signal processing strategy to construct the CI auditory\nelectrodogram. The proposed study uses 50 speakers from each of three different\ndatabases for training the system using two different classifiers under quiet,\nand tested under both quiet and noisy conditions. The objective result shows\nthat, the CI users can effectively identify a limited number of speakers.\nHowever, their performance decreases when more speakers are added in the\nsystem, as well as when noisy conditions are introduced. This information could\ntherefore be used for improving CI-user signal processing techniques to improve\nhuman SID.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 18:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-02"}

This setting has been investigated in several recent works, but the\noptimal error rates remain unclear. In this paper, we provide lower bounds on\nthe expected optimization error with these heuristics (using SGD with any\nconstant step size), which elucidate their advantages and disadvantages. In\nparticular, we prove that after $k$ passes over $n$ individual functions, if\nthe functions are re-shuffled after every pass, the best possible optimization\nerror for SGD is at least $\\Omega\\left(1/(nk)^2+1/nk^3\\right)$, which partially\ncorresponds to recently derived upper bounds. Moreover, if the functions are\nonly shuffled once, then the lower bound increases to $\\Omega(1/nk^2)$. Since\nthere are strictly smaller upper bounds for repeated reshuffling, this proves\nan inherent performance gap between SGD with single shuffling and repeated\nshuffling. As a more minor contribution, we also provide a non-asymptotic\n$\\Omega(1/k^2)$ lower bound (independent of $n$) for the incremental gradient\nmethod, when no random shuffling takes place.

The renormalization scale $Q^2$ of the running coupling depends\ndynamically on the virtuality of the underlying quark and gluon subprocess and\nthus the specific kinematics of each event. The determination of the\nrenormalization scale for event shape distributions is obtained by using the\nPrinciple of Maximum Conformality (PMC), a rigorous scale-setting method for\ngauge theories which satisfies all the requirements of Renormalization Group\nInvariance, including renormalization-scheme independence and consistency with\nAbelian theory in the $N_C \\to 0$ limit. In this paper we apply the PMC to two\nclassic event shapes measured in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation: the thrust ($T$) and\nC-parameter ($C$). The PMC renormalization scale depends differentially on the\nvalues of $T$ and $C$. The application of PMC scale-setting determines the\nrunning coupling $\\alpha_s(Q^2)$ to high precision over a wide range of $Q^2$\nfrom $10$ to $250~\\rm{GeV}^2$ from measurements of the event shape\ndistributions at the $Z^0$ peak.

Many molecular lines dominating\nM-dwarf spectra (e.g., FeH, CaH, MgH, and TiO) are temperature -- and Zeeman --\nsensitive and form at different atmospheric heights, which makes them excellent\nprobes of magnetic fields on M dwarfs. Our goal is to analyze the complexity of\nmagnetic fields in M dwarfs.

However, many individuals cannot learn to successfully modulate their\nbrain activity, greatly limiting the efficacy of BCI for therapy and for basic\nscientific inquiry. Previous research suggests that coherent activity across\ndiverse cognitive systems is a hallmark of individuals who can successfully\nlearn to control the BCI.

These systems are `active' or\nfar-from-equilibrium, due to local forcing of the solvent by the constituent\nparticles. In many cases the source of activity is chiral; since forcing is\ninternally generated, some sort of `torque dipole' is then present locally. But\nit is not obvious how `torque dipoles' should be encoded in the hydrodynamic\nequations that describe the system at continuum level: different authors have\narrived at contradictory conclusions on this issue. In this work, we resolve\nthe paradox by presenting a careful derivation, from linear irreversible\nthermodynamics, of the general equations of motion of a single-component chiral\nactive fluid with spin degrees of freedom. We find that there is no unique\nhydrodynamic description for such a fluid in the presence of torque dipoles of\na given strength. Instead, at least three different hydrodynamic descriptions\nemerge, depending on whether we decompose each torque dipole as two point\ntorques, two force pairs, or one point torque and one force pair -- where point\ntorques create internal angular momenta of the chiral bodies (spin), whereas\nforce pairs impart centre of mass motion that contributes to fluid velocity. By\nconsidering a general expansion of the Onsager coefficients, we also derive a\nnew shear-elongation parameter and cross-coupling viscosity, which can lead to\nunpredicted phenomena even in passive polar liquid crystals. Finally,\nelimination of the angular variables gives an effective polar hydrodynamics\nwith renormalized active stresses, viscosities and kinetic coefficients.\nRemarkably, this can include a direct contribution of chiral activity to the\nequation of motion for the polar order parameter, which survives even in `dry'\nactive systems where the fluid velocity is set to zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 20:22:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-02"}

One\nof the biggest challenges and opportunities to advance topology-based\nvisualization is to understand and incorporate uncertainty into such\ntopological descriptors to effectively reason about their underlying data. In\nthis paper, we study a structural average of a set of labeled merge trees and\nuse it to encode uncertainty in data.

In practice, the data might not be dense on these domains, and\ntherefore, the approximation theory results are observed to be too\nconservative. In manifold learning, one assumes instead that the data is\nsampled from an unknown manifold; i.e., the manifold is defined by the data\nitself. Function approximation on this unknown manifold is then a two stage\nprocedure: first, one approximates the Laplace-Beltrami operator (and its\neigen-decomposition) on this manifold using a graph Laplacian, and next,\napproximates the target function using the eigen-functions. Alternatively, one\nestimates first some atlas on the manifold and then uses local approximation\ntechniques based on the local coordinate charts.\n  In this paper, we propose a more direct approach to function approximation on\n\\emph{unknown}, data defined manifolds without computing the\neigen-decomposition of some operator or an atlas for the manifold, and without\nany kind of training in the classical sense. Our constructions are universal;\ni.e., do not require the knowledge of any prior on the target function other\nthan continuity on the manifold. We estimate the degree of approximation. For\nsmooth functions, the estimates do not suffer from the so-called saturation\nphenomenon. We demonstrate via a property called good propagation of errors how\nthe results can be lifted for function approximation using deep networks where\neach channel evaluates a Gaussian network on a possibly unknown manifold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 00:42:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 00:18:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 23:35:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 04:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-21"}

The current injection controller is no\nlonger synchronized with the point of common coupling at which the measured\nvoltage signal can be severely affected by faults in the weak grid, but with\nthe strong grid point at which the voltage is rigid. It is shown that the phase\ndifference between the voltage source converter and the strong grid voltages\ncaused by the long power lines does not affect the power control.

In this paper,\nwe address three critical challenges for this task in a reinforcement learning\nsetting: the mode collapse, the delayed feedback, and the time-consuming\nwarm-up for policy networks. Generally, we propose a novel Curiosity-driven\nReinforcement Learning (CRL) framework to jointly enhance the diversity and\naccuracy of the generated paragraphs. First, by modeling the paragraph\ncaptioning as a long-term decision-making process and measuring the prediction\nuncertainty of state transitions as intrinsic rewards, the model is\nincentivized to memorize precise but rarely spotted descriptions to context,\nrather than being biased towards frequent fragments and generic patterns.\nSecond, since the extrinsic reward from evaluation is only available until the\ncomplete paragraph is generated, we estimate its expected value at each time\nstep with temporal-difference learning, by considering the correlations between\nsuccessive actions. Then the estimated extrinsic rewards are complemented by\ndense intrinsic rewards produced from the derived curiosity module, in order to\nencourage the policy to fully explore action space and find a global optimum.\nThird, discounted imitation learning is integrated for learning from human\ndemonstrations, without separately performing the time-consuming warm-up in\nadvance. Extensive experiments conducted on the Standford image-paragraph\ndataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method,\nimproving the performance by 38.4% compared with state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 01:33:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 09:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-30"}

Although\ntraditionally, the Seebeck effect plays a key role for the TE figure of merit\nzST, it encounters fundamental constraints hindering its conversion efficiency.\nMost notably, there are the charge compensation of electrons and holes that\ndiminishes this effect, and the intertwinement of the corresponding electrical\nand thermal conductivities through the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law which makes\ntheir independent optimization in zST impossible. Here, we demonstrate that in\nthe Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 the Nernst effect, i.e., the transverse counterpart\nof the Seebeck effect, can generate a large TE figure of merit zNT. At room\ntemperature, zNT = 0.5 in a small field of 2 T; it significantly surmounts its\nlongitudinal counterpart zST for any field and further increases upon warming.\nA large Nernst effect is generically expected in topological semimetals,\nbenefiting from both the bipolar transport of compensated electrons and holes\nand their high mobilities. In this case, heat and charge transport are\northogonal, i.e., not intertwined by the WF law anymore. More importantly,\nfurther optimization of zNT by tuning the Fermi level to the Dirac node can be\nanticipated due to not only the enhanced bipolar transport, but also the\nanomalous Nernst effect arising from a pronounced Berry curvature.

Several different types of graph neural network models have\nbeen introduced for learning the representations from such different types of\ngraphs already. In this paper, for these two different types of graph data, we\nwill introduce the graph neural networks introduced in recent years. To be more\nspecific, the graph neural networks introduced in this paper include IsoNN,\nSDBN, LF&ER, GCN, GAT, DifNN, GNL, GraphSage and seGEN. Among these graph\nneural network models, IsoNN, SDBN and LF&ER are initially proposed for small\ngraphs and the remaining ones are initially proposed for giant networks\ninstead. The readers are also suggested to refer to these papers for detailed\ninformation when reading this tutorial paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 02:35:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-30"}

The classical part\nof this can be viewed as requiring just Lie's Mathematics, albeit entrenched in\nsubsequent Topology and Differential Geometry developments and extended to the\nsetting of contemporary Physics' state spaces. We now generalize this approach\nby mild recategorization to one based on Nijenhuis' generalization of Lie's\nMathematics, as follows. 1) Relationalism is encoded using the Nijenhuis-Lie\nderivative. 2) Closure is assessed using the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket, and a\n`Schouten-Nijenhuis Algorithm' analogue of the Dirac and Lie Algorithms. This\nproduces a class of Gerstenhaber algebraic structures of generators or of\nconstraints. 3) Observables are defined by a Schouten--Nijenhuis brackets\nrelation, reformulating the constrained canonical case as explicit PDEs to be\nsolved using the Flow Method, and forming their own Gerstenhaber algebras of\nobservables. Lattices of Schouten-Nijenhuis-Gerstenhaber constraint or\ngenerator algebraic substructures furthermore induce dual lattices of\nGerstenhaber observables subalgebras. 4) Deformation of Gerstenhaber algebraic\nstructures of generators or constraints encountering Rigidity gives a means of\nConstructing more structure from less. 5) Reallocation of Intermediary-Object\nInvariance gives the general Schouten-Nijenhuis-Gerstenhaber algebraic\nstructure's analogue of posing Refoliation Invariance for GR.

These attacks which aim at\ninjecting bogus/spurious data into the receiver, involve inferring transmission\nparameters and finding PHY characteristics of the transmitted signals so as to\nspoof the received signal. Non-contiguous (NC) OFDM systems have been argued to\nhave low probability of exploitation (LPE) characteristics against classic\nattacks based on cyclostationary analysis, and the corresponding PHY has been\ndeemed to be secure. However, with the advent of machine learning (ML)\nalgorithms, adversaries can devise data-driven attacks to compromise such\nsystems. It is in this vein that PHY spoofing performance of adversaries\nequipped with supervised and unsupervised ML tools are investigated in this\npaper. The supervised ML approach is based on deep neural networks (DNN) while\nthe unsupervised one employs variational autoencoders (VAEs). In particular,\nVAEs are shown to be capable of learning representations from NC-OFDM signals\nrelated to their PHY characteristics such as frequency pattern and modulation\nscheme, which are useful for PHY spoofing. In addition, a new metric based on\nthe disentanglement principle is proposed to measure the quality of such\nlearned representations. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of\nthe spoofing adversaries highly depends on the subcarriers' allocation\npatterns. Particularly, it is shown that utilizing a random subcarrier\noccupancy pattern secures NC-OFDM systems against ML-based attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 03:34:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 19:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-18"}

Recently GPU-based hybrid right-looking sparse LU solver,\ncalled GLU (1.0 and 2.0), has been proposed to exploit the fine grain level\nparallelism of GPU. However, a new type of data dependency (called double-U\ndependency) introduced by GLU slows down the preprocessing step. Furthermore,\nGLU uses fixed GPU thread allocation strategy, which limits the parallelism. In\nthis article, we propose a new GPU-based sparse LU factorization method, called\n{\\it GLU3.0}, which solves the aforementioned problems. First, it introduces a\nmuch more efficient data dependency detection algorithm. Second, we observe\nthat the potential parallelism is different as the matrix factorization goes\non. We then develop three different modes of GPU kernel which adapt to\ndifferent stages to accommodate the computing task changes in the\nfactorization.

Ising computing essentially tries to solve the quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization problem, which is also described by the Ising\nspin glass model and is also the basis for so-called Quantum Annealing\ncomputers. In this work, we propose a novel General Purpose Graphics Processing\nUnit (GPGPU) solver for the balanced min-cut graph partitioning problem, which\nhas many applications in the area of design automation and others. Ising model\nsolvers for the balanced min-cut partitioning problem have been proposed in the\npast. However, they have rarely been demonstrated in existing quantum computers\nfor many meaningful problem sizes. One difficulty is the fact that the\nbalancing constraint in the balanced min-cut problem can result in a complete\ngraph in the Ising model, which makes each local update a global update. Such\nglobal update from each GPU thread will diminish the efficiency of GPU\ncomputing, which favors many localized memory accesses for each thread. To\nmitigate this problem, we propose an novel Global Decoupled Ising (GDI) model\nand the corresponding annealing algorithm, in which the local update is still\npreserved to maintain the efficiency. As a result, the new Ising solver\nessentially eliminates the need for the fully connected graph and will use a\nmore efficient method to track and update global balance without sacrificing\ncut quality. Experimental results show that the proposed Ising-based min-cut\npartitioning method outperforms the state of art partitioning tool, METIS, on\nG-set graph benchmarks in terms of partitioning quality with similar CPU/GPU\ntimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 04:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-02"}

While this\nerror is pervasive, its prevalence might be amplified or mitigated by the way\nthat the data is presented to a viewer. Across three crowdsourced experiments,\nwe examined whether how simple data relations are presented would mitigate this\nreasoning error. The first experiment tested examples similar to the\nbreakfast-GPA relation, varying in the plausibility of the causal link.

Overall, different visualization\ndesigns afford different cognitive reasoning affordances across the same data.\nHigh levels of data aggregation by graphs tend to be associated with higher\nperceived causality in data.

This motivates us to consider the equal transmit power\nin the channel estimation and then optimize channel use allocation between\npilot and information signals in covert wireless communication.

The case of phase variables significantly differs from the\ncase of linear ones; the relevant order parameters are the Kuramoto-Daido ones\nbut not the conventional moments. One can formally introduce `circular'\ncumulants for Kuramoto-Daido order parameters, similar to the conventional\ncumulants for moments. The circular cumulant expansions allow to advance beyond\nthe Ott-Antonsen theory and consider populations of real oscillators. First, we\nshow that truncation of circular cumulant expansions, except for the\nOtt-Antonsen case, is forbidden. Second, we compare this situation to the case\nof the Gaussian distribution of a linear variable, where the second cumulant is\nnonzero and all the higher cumulants are zero, and elucidate why keeping up to\nthe second cumulant is admissible for a linear variable, but forbidden for\ncircular cumulants.

The\neffect of the mean-field feedback strength in the symmetry preserving coupling\nis also explored. The parameter space of aging transition was increased\nabruptly even for a feeble decrease in the feedback strength and subsequently,\nthe aging transition was observed at a critical value of the feedback strength\nsurprisingly without any counter-rotating oscillators. Further, the study was\nextended to symmetry breaking coupling using conjugate variables and it was\nobserved that the symmetry breaking coupling can facilitating the onset of\naging transition even in the absence of counter-rotating oscillators and for\nthe unit value of the feedback strength. In general, the parameter space of\naging transition was found to increase by increasing the frequency of\noscillators and by increasing the proportion of the counter-rotating\noscillators in both the symmetry preserving and symmetry breaking couplings.\nFurther, the transition from oscillatory to aging transition occurs via a Hopf\nbifurcation, while the transition from aging transition to oscillation death\nstate emerges via Pitchfork bifurcation.

If pattern recognition problems such as clustering and\nclassification are to be solved on these domains, a (dis-)similarity measure\nfor labeled graphs has to be defined. A widely used measure is the graph edit\ndistance (GED), which, intuitively, is defined as the minimum amount of\ndistortion that has to be applied to a source graph in order to transform it\ninto a target graph. The main advantage of GED is its flexibility and\nsensitivity to small differences between the input graphs. Its main drawback is\nthat it is hard to compute.\n  In this thesis, new results and techniques for several aspects of computing\nGED are presented. Firstly, theoretical aspects are discussed: competing\ndefinitions of GED are harmonized, the problem of computing GED is\ncharacterized in terms of complexity, and several reductions from GED to the\nquadratic assignment problem (QAP) are presented. Secondly, solvers for the\nlinear sum assignment problem with error-correction (LSAPE) are discussed.\nLSAPE is a generalization of the well-known linear sum assignment problem\n(LSAP), and has to be solved as a subproblem by many GED algorithms. In\nparticular, a new solver is presented that efficiently reduces LSAPE to LSAP.\nThirdly, exact algorithms for computing GED are presented in a systematic way,\nand improvements of existing algorithms as well as a new mixed integer\nprogramming (MIP) based approach are introduced. Fourthly, a detailed overview\nof heuristic algorithms that approximate GED via upper and lower bounds is\nprovided, and eight new heuristics are described. Finally, a new easily\nextensible C++ library for exactly or approximately computing GED is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 08:33:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-02"}

Both approximations lend\nthemselves easily to implementation within a whole spectrum of semiempirical\nquantum-chemical semiempirical methods. Here we present the implementation\nwithin the tight-binding DFT and benchmark its performance against analytical\nTD-DFT NAC vectors for a range of planar fluorescent chromophores at the\nFranck-Condon point.

Although quantitative predictions are not possible, these simple\nand intuitive approximations allow to explain, in a qualitative way, trends in\nthe electronic coupling in extended molecular systems and complex materials. In\nthis context, we investigate how the non-adiabatic coupling depends on the\ndelocalization length of an excitation in chromophoric oligomers based on a\nsimple model.

Deep\nlearning, as a powerful machine learning technology, has shown great advantages\nand promising application in load forecasting tasks. However, deep learning is\na computationally-hungry method, and requires high costs (e.g., time, energy\nand CO2 emission) to train a deep learning model, which aggravates the energy\ncrisis and incurs a substantial burden to the environment. As a consequence,\nthe deep learning methods are difficult to be popularized and applied in the\nreal smart grid environment. In this paper, we propose a low training cost\nmodel based on convolutional neural network, namely LoadCNN, for next-day load\nforecasting of individual resident with reduced training cost. The experiments\nshow that the training time of LoadCNN is only approximately 1/54 of the one of\nother state-of-the-art models, and energy consumption and CO2 emissions are\nonly approximate 1/45 of those of other state-of-the-art models based on the\nsame indicators.

Water molecules are found to get exchanged between the ice-like\nand water-like domains of the interface with a time scale of the order of ~10\nps. To investigate the effect of interfaces in general, we study three other\nsystems, namely (i) water between two hydrophobic nano-slabs, (ii) water at\nprotein and (iii) DNA surfaces. In all these systems, we find that the\ndifference from bulk properties become negligible beyond ~1 nm, with structural\nfeatures converging to bulk values faster than the dynamical properties.

However, the core idea of an IDS is a reactive\nmechanism in nature even though it detects intrusions which have already been\nin the system. Hence, the reactive mechanisms would be way behind and not\neffective for the actions taken by agile and smart attackers. Due to the\ninherent limitation of an IDS with the reactive nature, intrusion prevention\nsystems (IPSs) have been developed to thwart potential attackers and/or\nmitigate the impact of the intrusions before they penetrate into the system. In\nthis chapter, we introduce an integrated defense mechanism to achieve intrusion\nprevention in a software-defined Internet-of-Things (IoT) network by leveraging\nthe technologies of cyberdeception (i.e., a decoy system) and moving target\ndefense, namely MTD (i.e., network topology shuffling). In addition, we\nvalidate their effectiveness and efficiency based on the devised graphical\nsecurity model (GSM)-based evaluation framework. To develop an adaptive,\nproactive intrusion prevention mechanism, we employed fitness functions based\non the genetic algorithm in order to identify an optimal network topology where\na network topology can be shuffled based on the detected level of the system\nvulnerability. Our simulation results show that GA-based shuffling schemes\noutperform random shuffling schemes in terms of the number of attack paths\ntoward decoy targets. In addition, we observe that there exists a tradeoff\nbetween the system lifetime (i.e., mean time to security failure) and the\ndefense cost introduced by the proposed MTD technique for fixed and adaptive\nshuffling schemes. That is, a fixed GA-based shuffling can achieve higher MTTSF\nwith more cost while an adaptive GA-based shuffling obtains less MTTSF with\nless cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 11:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-02"}

In order to detect the objects in various sizes, the object\ndetectors often exploit the hierarchy of the multi-scale feature maps called\nfeature pyramid, which is readily obtained by the CNN architecture. However,\nthe performance of these object detectors is limited since the bottom-level\nfeature maps, which experience fewer convolutional layers, lack the semantic\ninformation needed to capture the characteristics of the small objects. In\norder to address such problem, various methods have been proposed to increase\nthe depth for the bottom-level features used for object detection. While most\napproaches are based on the generation of additional features through the\ntop-down pathway with lateral connections, our approach directly fuses\nmulti-scale feature maps using bidirectional long short term memory (biLSTM) in\neffort to generate deeply fused semantics. Then, the resulting semantic\ninformation is redistributed to the individual pyramidal feature at each scale\nthrough the channel-wise attention model.

The resulting evolution of the surface rotation period, which\ncan be directly measured photometrically, has the potential to provide an\naccurate indicator of stellar age, and is constrained by observations of\nrotation periods of coeval stars, such as members of Galactic open clusters. A\nprominent observational feature of the mass-rotation period diagrams of open\nclusters is a sequence of relatively slower rotators. The formation and\npersistence of this slow rotators sequence across several billion years imply\nan approximately coherent spin-down of the stars that belong to it. In\nparticular, the sequence is observed to evolve coherently towards longer\nperiods in progressively older clusters. Recent observations of the 700-Myr old\nPraesepe and the 1-Gyr old NGC 6811 clusters, however, seem to contradict this\ngeneral pattern. While the 1 Msun stars on the slow rotators sequence of the\nolder NGC 6811 have longer periods than their counterparts in the younger\nPraesepe, as expected, the two sequences essentially merge at lower masses (<\n0.8 Msun). In other words, low-mass stars seem to have not been spinning down\nat all in the intervening 300 Myr. Here we show that this behavior is a\nmanifestation of the variable rotational coupling in solar-like stars. The\nresurfacing of angular momentum from the interior can temporarily compensate\nfor the loss due to wind braking at the surface. The internal redistribution of\nangular momentum has a steep mass dependence; as a result, the re-coupling\noccurs at different ages for stars of different masses. Our model explains the\nstalled surface spin-down of low-mass stars between Praesepe and NGC 6811, and\npredicts that the same behavior should be observable at other ages in other\nmass ranges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 12:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

With a\nGPU-based Monte Carlo dose engine (ARCHER) to derive CT dose of a phantom made\nfrom a subject's CT scan, we are then able to compute the patient-specific CT\ndose for each of the segmented organs.

The dose computation results are\nalso compared against organ doses from population-average phantoms to\ndemonstrate the improvement achieved by using the developed tool.

Among the main parts of a BO\nalgorithm, the acquisition function is of fundamental importance, since it\nguides the optimization algorithm by translating the uncertainty of the\nregression model in a utility measure for each point to be evaluated.\nConsidering such aspect, selection and design of acquisition functions are one\nof the most popular research topics in BO. Since no single acquisition function\nwas proved to have better performance in all tasks, a well-established approach\nconsists of selecting different acquisition functions along the iterations of a\nBO execution. In such an approach, the GP-Hedge algorithm is a widely used\noption given its simplicity and good performance. Despite its success in\nvarious applications, GP-Hedge shows an undesirable characteristic of\naccounting on all past performance measures of each acquisition function to\nselect the next function to be used. In this case, good or bad values obtained\nin an initial iteration may impact the choice of the acquisition function for\nthe rest of the algorithm. This fact may induce a dominant behavior of an\nacquisition function and impact the final performance of the method. Aiming to\novercome such limitation, in this work we propose a variant of GP-Hedge, named\nNo-PASt-BO, that reduce the influence of far past evaluations. Moreover, our\nmethod presents a built-in normalization that avoids the functions in the\nportfolio to have similar probabilities, thus improving the exploration. The\nobtained results on both synthetic and real-world optimization tasks indicate\nthat No-PASt-BO presents competitive performance and always outperforms\nGP-Hedge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 12:37:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-02"}

Our VLA and EVN HI\nabsorption observations, modelling, and comparison with molecular gas data\nsuggest that the cold gas in the centre of NGC 1167 is very turbulent (with a\nvelocity dispersion of ~ 90 km/s) and that this turbulence is induced by the\ninteraction of the jets with the interstellar medium (ISM). Furthermore, the\nionised gas in the galaxy shows evidence of shock heating at a few kpc from the\nradio source.

In this work, we show two eminent effects of the human\nvisual system, namely, content-dependency and temporal-memory effects, could be\nused for this purpose. We propose an objective no-reference video quality\nassessment method by integrating both effects into a deep neural network. For\ncontent-dependency, we extract features from a pre-trained image classification\nneural network for its inherent content-aware property. For temporal-memory\neffects, long-term dependencies, especially the temporal hysteresis, are\nintegrated into the network with a gated recurrent unit and a\nsubjectively-inspired temporal pooling layer.

A comet nucleus emits gas as it is heated by the sunlight. The\ngas forms the coma, where it is ionised, becomes a plasma and eventually\ninteracts with the solar wind. Besides these neutral and ionised gases, the\ncoma also contains dust grains, released from the comet nucleus. As a cometary\natmosphere develops when the comet travels through the solar system,\nlarge-scale structures, such as the plasma boundaries, develop and disappear,\nwhile at planets such large-scale structures are only accessible in their fully\ngrown, quasi-steady state. In situ measurements at comets enable us to learn\nboth how such large-scale structures are formed or reformed and how small-scale\nprocesses in the plasma affect the formation and properties of these large\nscale structures. Furthermore, a comet goes through a wide range of parameter\nregimes during its life cycle, where either collisional processes, involving\nneutrals and charged particles, or collisionless processes are at play, and\nmight even compete in complicated transitional regimes. Thus a comet presents a\nunique opportunity to study this parameter space, from an asteroid-like to a\nMars- and Venus-like interaction. Fast flybys of comets have made many new\ndiscoveries, setting the stage for a multi-spacecraft mission to accompany a\ncomet on its journey through the solar system. This white paper reviews the\npresent-day knowledge of cometary plasmas, discusses the many questions that\nremain unanswered, and outlines a multi-spacecraft ESA mission to accompany a\ncomet that will answer these questions by combining both multi-spacecraft\nobservations and a rendezvous mission, and at the same time advance our\nunderstanding of fundamental plasma physics and its role in planetary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 13:16:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-02"}

Furthermore, they also\nignore the multi-scale spatial contexts, which play a vital role for the 3D\ninference. To address these issues, in this work we propose a novel deep\nlearning framework, named Cascaded Context Pyramid Network (CCPNet), to jointly\ninfer the occupancy and semantic labels of a volumetric 3D scene from a single\ndepth image.

For example, if a scatterplot is projected\nfrom a laptop to a large projector screen, then observers may feel that the\nscatterplot shown on the projector has fewer points than that viewed on the\nlaptop.

This originated from the seminal work of Frank, who conjectured\nthat glasses may be the result of the local tendency of liquids to form\nicosahedral structures, which are not capable of globally filling space\nregularly. Here, we show that, for a fundamental glass model, dynamics can be\nfully understood by simply counting the number of tetrahedra. Both globally and\nlocally, these local structures directly predict dynamical slowdown. After more\nthan 60 years of Frank's Conjecture, it might not be the icosahedra that matter\nfor glasses, but rather the tetrahedra inside them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 14:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

To open a payment channel one has to publish\na transaction on-chain and pay the appropriate transaction fee. A transaction\ncan be routed in the network, as long as there is a path of channels with the\nnecessary capital. The intermediate nodes on this path can ask for a fee to\nforward the transaction. Hence, opening channels, although costly, can benefit\na party, both by reducing the cost of the party for sending a transaction and\nby collecting the fees from forwarding transactions of other parties.\n  This trade-off spawns a network creation game between the channel parties. In\nthis work, we introduce the first game theoretic model for analyzing the\nnetwork creation game on blockchain payment channels.

The only water\nsupply in Antarctica, precipitation, is poorly estimated from surface\nmeasurements. The onboard cloud-profiling radar of the CloudSat satellite\nprovided the first real opportunity to estimate precipitation at continental\nscale. Based on CloudSat observations, we propose to explore the vertical\nstructure of precipitation in Antarctica over the 2007-2010 period. A first\ndivision of this dataset following a topographical approach (continent versus\nperipheral regions, with a 2250m topographical criterion) shows a high\nprecipitation rate (275mm/yr at 1200meters above ground level) with low\nrelative seasonal variation (+/-11%) over the peripheral areas. Over the\nplateau, the precipitation rate is low (34mm/yr at 1200m.a.g.l.) with a much\nlarger relative seasonal variation (+/-143%). A second study that follows a\ngeographical division highlights the average vertical structure of\nprecipitation and temperature depending on the regions and their interactions\nwith topography. In particular, over ice-shelves, we see a strong dependence of\nthe distribution of precipitation on the sea-ice coverage. Finally, the\nrelationship between precipitation and temperature is analyzed and compared\nwith a simple analytical relationship. This study highlights that precipitation\nis largely dependent on the advection of air masses along the topographic\nslopes with an average vertical wind of 0.02m/s.

We proposed a deep learning method to detect and classify cells in\nmIHC whole-tumour slide images of breast cancer.

Here we analytically derive the necessary conditions for\nthis transition by means of the coherent stability function approach, which is\nakin to the master stability function approach that is traditionally used to\nstudy the stability of synchronization in coupled oscillators. In chimera\nstates, there is typically at least one group of oscillators that evolves in a\ndrifting, random manner, while other groups of oscillators follow a smoother,\nmore coherent profile. In the coherent state, there thus exists a smooth\nfunctional relationship between the oscillators. This lays the foundation for\nthe coherent stability function approach, where we determine the stability of\nthe coherent state. We subsequently test the analytical prediction numerically\nby calculating the strength of incoherence during the transition point. We use\nleech neurons, which exhibit a coexistence of chaotic and periodic tonic\nspiking depending on initial conditions, coupled via non-local electrical\nsynapses, to demonstrate our approach. We systematically explore various\ndynamical states with the focus on the transitions between chimeras and\ncoherence, fully confirming the validity of the coherent stability function. We\nalso observe complete synchronization for higher values of the coupling\nstrength, which we verify by the master stability function approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 12:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

We investigate the evolution of X-ray selected tidal disruption events.\nMethods. New events are found in near-real time data from XMM-Newton slews and\nare monitored by multi-wavelength facilities. Results. In August 2016, X-ray\nemission was detected from the galaxy XMMSL2 J144605.0+685735 (a.k.a. 2MASX\n14460522+6857311), a factor 20 times higher than an upper limit from 25 years\nearlier. The X-ray flux was flat for ~100 days and then fell by a factor 100\nover the following 500 days. The UV flux was stable for the first 400 days\nbefore fading by a magnitude, while the optical (U,B,V bands) have been roughly\nconstant for 850 days. Optically, the galaxy appears to be quiescent, at a\ndistance of $127\\pm{4}$ Mpc (z=$0.029\\pm{0.001}$) with a spectrum consisting of\na young stellar population of age 1-5 Gyr, an older population and a total\nstellar mass of ~6 x $10^{9}$ solar masses.

The independent behaviour of the optical, UV and X-ray\nlight curves challenges models where the UV emission is produced by\nreprocessing of thermal nuclear emission or by stream-stream collisions.

Motivated by the processes that are known to be\ninvolved in sleep generation in biological networks, we developed an algorithm\nthat implements a sleep-like phase in artificial neural networks (ANNs). After\ninitial training phase, we convert the ANN to a spiking neural network (SNN)\nand simulate an offline sleep-like phase using spike-timing dependent\nplasticity rules to modify synaptic weights. The SNN is then converted back to\nthe ANN and evaluated or trained on new inputs. We demonstrate several\nperformance improvements after applying this processing to ANNs trained on\nMNIST, CUB200 and a motivating toy dataset. First, in an incremental learning\nframework, sleep is able to recover older tasks that were otherwise forgotten\nin the ANN without sleep phase due to catastrophic forgetting. Second, sleep\nresults in forward transfer learning of unseen tasks. Finally, sleep improves\ngeneralization ability of the ANNs to classify images with various types of\nnoise. We provide a theoretical basis for the beneficial role of the\nbrain-inspired sleep-like phase for the ANNs and present an algorithmic way for\nfuture implementations of the various features of sleep in deep learning ANNs.\nOverall, these results suggest that biological sleep can help mitigate a number\nof problems ANNs suffer from, such as poor generalization and catastrophic\nforgetting for incremental learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 04:23:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

The majority of existing methods for short\ntext relevance classification fail to incorporate users' knowledge into the\nclassification process.

Recent\nworks have shown that the performance of quantization systems acquiring\nmultiple analog signals using scalar analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) can be\nsignificantly improved by properly processing the analog signals prior to\nquantization. However, the design of such hybrid quantizers is quite complex,\nand their implementation requires complete knowledge of the statistical model\nof the analog signal, which may not be available in practice. In this work we\ndesign data-driven task-oriented quantization systems with scalar ADCs, which\ndetermine how to map an analog signal into its digital representation using\ndeep learning tools. These representations are designed to facilitate the task\nof recovering underlying information from the quantized signals, which can be a\nset of parameters to estimate, or alternatively, a classification task. By\nutilizing deep learning, we circumvent the need to explicitly recover the\nsystem model and to find the proper quantization rule for it.

Our results indicate that, in a MIMO\nchannel estimation setup, the proposed deep task-bask quantizer is capable of\napproaching the optimal performance limits dictated by indirect rate-distortion\ntheory, achievable using vector quantizers and requiring complete knowledge of\nthe underlying statistical model. Furthermore, for a symbol detection scenario,\nit is demonstrated that the proposed approach can realize reliable\nbit-efficient hybrid MIMO receivers capable of setting their quantization rule\nin light of the task, e.g., to minimize the bit error rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 10:03:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

This emerging TI technology is\nexpected to create numerous opportunities for technology markets in a wide\nvariety of applications ranging from teleoperation systems and AR/VR to\nautomotive safety and eHealthcare towards addressing the complex problems of\nhuman society. However, the realization of TI over wireless media in the\nupcoming 5G and beyond networks creates various non-conventional communication\nchallenges and stringent requirements. To this end, this paper aims to provide\na holistic view on wireless TI along with a thorough review of the existing\nliterature, to identify and analyze the involved technical issues, to highlight\npotential solutions and to propose future research directions. First, starting\nwith the vision of TI and recent advances and a review of related\nsurvey/overview articles, we present a generalized framework for wireless TI in\nthe Beyond 5G Era including a TI architecture, main technical requirements, key\napplication areas and potential enabling technologies. Subsequently, we provide\na comprehensive review of the existing TI works by broadly categorizing them\ninto three main paradigms; namely, haptic communications, wireless AR/VR, and\nautonomous, intelligent and cooperative mobility systems. Next, potential\nenabling technologies across physical/MAC and network layers are identified and\ndiscussed in detail. Also, security and privacy issues of TI applications are\ndiscussed along with some promising enablers. Finally, we present some open\nresearch challenges and recommend promising future research directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:34:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-31"}
