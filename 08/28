This is called \"gravothermal catastrophe\" in the microcanonical\nensemble and \"isothermal collapse\" in the canonical ensemble. When quantum\nmechanics is taken into account and when the particle number is below the\nOppenheimer-Volkoff limit ($N<N_{\\rm OV}$), complete gravitational collapse is\nprevented by the Pauli exclusion principle. In that case, the Fermi gas\nundergoes a gravitational phase transition from a gaseous phase to a condensed\nphase. The condensed phase represents a compact object like a white dwarf, a\nneutron star, or a dark matter fermion ball.

We study the completeness of the LoTSS\nfirst data release (DR1) and find a point-source completeness of 99 % above\nflux densities of 0.8 mJy and define a suite of quality cuts. We determine the\ncount-in-cell statistics and differential source counts statistic and measure\nthe angular two-point correlation function of the LoTSS radio sources. The\ncounts-in-cell statistic reveals that the distribution of radio sources cannot\nbe described by a spatial Poisson process. Instead, a good fit is provided by a\ncompound Poisson distribution. The differential source counts are in good\nagreement with previous findings in deep fields at low radio frequencies and\nwith simulated catalogues from the SKA design study sky and the Tiered Radio\nExtragalactic Continuum Simulation. The angular two-point correlation is\n$<10^{-2}$ at angular scales $> 1$ deg. Restricting the value added source\ncatalogue to low-noise regions and a flux density threshold of 2 mJy provides\nour most reliable estimate of the angular two-point correlation. For smaller\nflux density thresholds systematic issues are identified, most likely related\nto the flux density calibration of the individual pointings. Based on the\ndistribution of photometric redshifts of LoTSS sources and the Planck 2018\nbest-fit cosmological model, the theoretically predicted angular two-point\ncorrelation between 0.1 deg and 6 deg agrees with the measured clustering for a\nsubsample of radio sources with redshift information.

Model searches, which explore to find\nan optimal ML algorithm and hyperparameter values for the target problem, play\na critical role in such improvements. During a model search, data scientists\ntypically use multiple ML implementations to construct several predictive\nmodels; however, it takes significant time and effort to employ multiple ML\nimplementations due to the need to learn how to use them, prepare input data in\nseveral different formats, and compare their outputs. Our proposed framework\naddresses these issues by providing simple and unified coding method. It has\nbeen designed with the following two attractive features: i) new machine\nlearning implementations can be added easily via common interfaces between the\nframework and ML implementations and ii) it can be scaled to handle large model\nconfiguration search spaces via profile-based scheduling. The results of our\nevaluation indicate that, with our framework, implementers need only write\n55-144 lines of code to add a new ML implementation. They also show that ours\nwas the fastest framework for the HIGGS dataset, and the second-fastest for the\nSECOM dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 16:35:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}

To overcome this fundamental limitation, we\nconsider person re-identification without inter-camera identity association but\nonly with identity labels independently annotated within each individual\ncamera-view. This eliminates the most time-consuming and tedious inter-camera\nidentity labelling process in order to significantly reduce the amount of human\nefforts required during annotation.

In addition,\nMTML can also efficiently learn the discriminative re-id feature\nrepresentations by fully using the available identity labels within each\ncamera-view.

To\ncheck our conjecture, and to extend all results to large values of $\\alpha$, we\nsolve for the spectra numerically. We explain how to accurately and efficiently\ncompute these spectra, without relying on separability. This allows us to\nobtain reliable results for any $\\alpha \\gtrsim 0.001$ and black holes of\narbitrary spin. Our results provide an essential input to the phenomenology of\nboson clouds around black holes, especially when these are part of binary\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-11"}

In\nparticular, delocalised excitations corresponding to coherent superposition of\nexcited states appear and change drastically the dynamics and steady state of\nthe systems. Such phenomena, which are central mechanisms of superradiance,\npresent interesting properties for thermodynamics and potentially other quantum\ntechnologies. Indeed, a recent paper [Phys. Rev. A 99, 052105 (2019)] studies\nthese properties in a pair of indistinguishable two-level systems and points\nout surprising effects of mitigation and amplification of the bath's action on\nthe energy and entropy of the pair. Here, we generalise the study to ensembles\nof arbitrary number of spins of arbitrary size (i.e. dimension). We confirm\nthat the previously uncovered mitigation and amplification effects remain, but\nalso that they become more and more pronounced with growing number of spins and\ngrowing spin size. Moreover, we find that the free energy variation and the\nentropy production associated with the bath-driven dissipation are\nsystematically reduced, formalising the idea of mitigation of the bath's\naction. Most remarkably, the combination of mitigation effects from two baths\nat different temperatures can result in amplifying their action. This is\nillustrated with cyclic thermal machines, and leads to large power\nenhancements. The reduction of irreversibility is also an interesting aspect\nsince irreversibility is known to limit the performance of thermodynamic tasks.\nThe above findings might also lead to interesting applications in collective\nwork extraction, quantum battery charging, state protection, light harvesting\ndevices, quantum biology, but also for the study of entropy production.\nMoreover, some experimental realisations and observations suggest that such\neffects are within reach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 18:05:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 08:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

On the equatorial\nbeta-plane the convection first aggregates near the equator, generating\npatterns related to those in the Matsuno--Gill problem. However, the pattern is\nunsteady and more convection is triggered on its eastern edge, leading to a\nprecipitating disturbance that progresses eastward. The effect is enhanced by\nwestward prevailing winds that increase the evaporation east of the\ndisturbance. The pattern is confined to a region within a few deformation radii\nof equator because here the convection can best create the convergence needed\nto organize into a self-sustaining pattern. Formation of the disturbance\npreferentially occurs where the surface is warmer and sufficient time (a few\ntens of days) must pass before conditions arise that enable the disturbance to\nreform, as is characteristic both of excitable systems and the MJO itself. The\nspeed of the disturbance depends on the efficiency of evaporation and the heat\nreleased by condensation, and is typically a few meters per second, much less\nthan the Kelvin wave speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 18:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Solving them is a crucial\nstep towards a precise knowledge of the behaviour of natural and engineered\nsystems. In general, in order to solve PDEs that represent real systems to an\nacceptable degree, analytical methods are usually not enough. One has to resort\nto discretization methods. For engineering problems, probably the best known\noption is the finite element method (FEM). However, powerful alternatives such\nas mesh-free methods and Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) are also available. The\nfundamental idea is to approximate the solution of the PDE by means of\nfunctions specifically built to have some desirable properties. In this\ncontribution, we explore Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as an option for\napproximation. They have shown impressive results in areas such as visual\nrecognition. DNNs are regarded here as function approximation machines. There\nis great flexibility to define their structure and important advances in the\narchitecture and the efficiency of the algorithms to implement them make DNNs a\nvery interesting alternative to approximate the solution of a PDE.

Four different spectra sampling four linear\npolarization angles are recorded in the focal plane, allowing the instrument to\nmeasure all linear polarization states in one exposure.

Electric\npower is used to produce, treat, distribute, and recycle water while water is\nused to generate and consume electricity. In the meantime, significant\nattention has been given to renewable energy integration within the context of\nglobal climate change. While these two issues may seem unrelated, their\nresolution is potentially synergistic in that renewable energy technologies not\nonly present low CO2 emissions but also low water-intensities. Furthermore,\nbecause water is readily stored, it has the potential to act as a flexible\nenergy resource on both the supply and the demand-side of the electricity grid.\nDespite these synergies, the renewable energy integration and energy-water\nnexus literature have yet to methodologically converge to systematically\naddress potential synergies. This paper advances an enterprise control\nmethodology as a means of assessing the techno-economic performance of the\nenergy water nexus. The enterprise control methodology has been developed in\nrecent years to advance the methodological state of the art of renewable energy\nintegration studies and used recently to carry out a full-scale study for the\nIndependent System Operator (ISO) New England system. The methodology\nquantifies day-ahead and real-time energy market production costs, dispatched\nenergy mixes, required operating reserves, levels of curtailment, and grid\nimbalances. This energy-water nexus methodological extension now includes\nflexible water-energy resources within the grid's energy resource portfolio and\nquantifies the amounts of water withdrawn and consumed.

POLITEX has sublinear regret guarantees in uniformly-mixing\nMDPs when the value estimation error can be controlled, which can be satisfied\nif all policies sufficiently explore the environment. Unfortunately, this\nassumption is often unrealistic.

In this paper, we\naddress the problem of unsupervised video-based re-identification by proposing\na consistent cross-view matching (CCM) framework, in which global camera\nnetwork constraints are exploited to guarantee the matched pairs are with\nconsistency. Specifically, we first propose to utilize the first neighbor of\neach sample to discover relations among samples and find the groups in each\ncamera. Additionally, a cross-view matching strategy followed by global camera\nnetwork constraints is proposed to explore the matching relationships across\nthe entire camera network.

These attacks do\nnot seek to degrade classification accuracy, but rather to have the classifier\nlearn to classify to a target class whenever the backdoor pattern is present in\na test example. Launching backdoor attacks does not require knowledge of the\nclassifier or its training process - it only needs the ability to poison the\ntraining set with (a sufficient number of) exemplars containing a sufficiently\nstrong backdoor pattern (labeled with the target class). Here we address\npost-training detection of backdoor attacks in DNN image classifiers, seldom\nconsidered in existing works, wherein the defender does not have access to the\npoisoned training set, but only to the trained classifier itself, as well as to\nclean examples from the classification domain.

We then approximate the\nsolution through two approaches: norm maximization (SHD-NM), and majorization\n(SHD-QRQU).

With the emergence of immunotherapy and novel\ntargeted therapies, departure from the proportional hazard assumption is not\nrare in nowadays clinical research. Under non-proportional hazards, the hazard\nratio does not have a straightforward clinical interpretation, and the log-rank\ntest is no longer the most powerful statistical test even though it is still\nvalid. Nevertheless, the log-rank test and the hazard ratio are still the\nprimary analysis tools, and traditional approaches such as sample size increase\nare still proposed to account for the impact of non-proportional hazards. The\nweighed log-rank test and the test based on the restricted mean survival time\n(RMST) are receiving a lot of attention as a potential alternative to the\nlog-rank test. We conduct a simulation study comparing the performance and\noperating characteristics of the log-rank test, the weighted log-rank test and\nthe test based on the RMST, including a treatment effect estimation, under\ndifferent non-proportional hazards patterns. Results show that, under\nnon-proportional hazards, the hazard ratio and weighted hazard ratio have no\nstraightforward clinical interpretation whereas the RMST ratio can be\ninterpreted regardless of the proportional hazards assumption. In terms of\npower, the RMST achieves a similar performance when compared to the log-rank\ntest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 00:33:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 17:38:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 16:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-27"}

Subsurface irrigation can be an\nalternative to surface irrigation as a means of losing less irrigation water,\nbut the application timing and amount are often difficult to determine.\nWell-defined soil and crop models are useful for assisting decision support,\nbut most of the models developed to date have been for surface irrigation. The\npresent study examines whether the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology\nTransfer (DSSAT, version 4.5) cropping system model is applicable for the\nproduction of processing tomatoes with subsurface irrigation, and it revises\nthe soil module to simulate irrigation schemes with subsurface irrigation. Five\nfarmed fields in California, USA, are used to test the performance of the\nmodel. The original DSSAT model fails to produce fruit yield by overestimating\nthe water deficiency. The soil water module is then revised by introducing the\nmovement of soil moisture due to a vertical soil moisture gradient. Moreover,\nan external parameter optimization system is constructed to minimize the error\nbetween the simulation and observations. The revised module reduces the errors\nin the soil moisture profile at each field compared to those by the original\nDSSAT model. The average soil moisture error decreases from 0.065m^3/m^3 to\n0.029m^3/m^3. The yields estimated by the modified model are in a reasonable\nrange from 80 to 150 ton/ha, which is commonly observed under well-managed\nconditions.

The\ncomputational cost of implicit time discretizations is dominated by the\nsolution of nonlinear systems of equations at each time step. In order to\ndecrease this cost, the recently developed Rosenbrock-Krylov (ROK) time\nintegration methods extend the classical linearly-implicit Rosenbrock(-W)\nmethods, and make use of a Krylov subspace approximation to the Jacobian\ncomputed via an Arnoldi process. Since the ROK order conditions rely on the\nconstruction of a single Krylov space, no restarting of the Arnoldi process is\nallowed, and the iterations quickly become expensive with increasing subspace\ndimensions. This work extends the ROK framework to make use of the Lanczos\nbiorthogonalization procedure for constructing Jacobian approximations. The\nresulting new family of methods is named biorthogonal ROK (BOROK). The Lanczos\nprocedure's short two-term recurrence allows BOROK methods to utilize larger\nsubspaces for the Jacobian approximation, resulting in increased numerical\nstability of the time integration at a reduced computational cost. Adaptive\nsubspace size selection and basis extension procedures are also developed for\nthe new schemes.

An\ninteresting two-step glass transition, with rotational glass transition\npreceding translational one, is identified experimentally in 2D colloidal rod\nsystems. During the transition, parallel and perpendicularly packed rods are\nfound to form local free energy minima in configurational space, separated by\nan activation barrier. This barrier increases significantly when rotational\nglass transition is approached; thereby the rotational motion is frozen while\nthe translational one remains diffusive. We argue that the activation barrier\nfor rotation is the origin of the two-step glass transition.

After label enrichment, the instance-level labels are\nfurther assigned to the corresponding pixels, producing the approximate\npixel-level labels and making fully supervised training of segmentation models\npossible. CAMEL achieves comparable performance with the fully supervised\napproaches in both instance-level classification and pixel-level segmentation\non CAMELYON16 and a colorectal adenoma dataset. Moreover, the generality of the\nautomatic labeling methodology may benefit future weakly supervised learning\nstudies for histopathology image analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 05:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-29"}

Clustering is a technique to reduce the number of\ncomparison needed to find similar pairs in a set of $n$ elements such as\nprotein sequences. Precise clustering ensures that each pair of similar\nelements appears together in at least one cluster, so that similarities can be\nidentified by all-to-all comparison in each cluster rather than on the full\nset. This paper introduces ClusterMerge, a new algorithm for precise clustering\nthat uses transitive relationships among the elements to enable parallel and\nscalable implementations of this approach. We apply ClusterMerge to the\nimportant problem of finding similar amino acid sequences in a collection of\nproteins. ClusterMerge identifies 99.8% of similar pairs found by a full\n$O(n^2)$ comparison, with only half as many operations. More importantly,\nClusterMerge is highly amenable to parallel and distributed computation. Our\nimplementation achieves a speedup of 604$\\times$ on 768 cores (1400$\\times$\nfaster than a comparable single-threaded clustering implementation), a strong\nscaling efficiency of 90%, and a weak scaling efficiency of nearly 100%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 07:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-29"}

The training set is based on 465 realizations\nof a cubic box with a side length of $256\\ h^{-1}\\ \\rm Mpc$, sampled with\n$128^3$ particles interpolated over a cubic grid of $128^3$ voxels. These\nvolumes have cosmological parameters varying within the flat $\\Lambda$CDM\nparameter space of $0.16 \\leq \\Omega_m \\leq 0.46$ and $2.0 \\leq 10^9 A_s \\leq\n2.3$. The neural network takes as an input cubes with $32^3$ voxels and has\nthree convolution layers, three dense layers, together with some batch\nnormalization and pooling layers. In the final predictions from the network we\nfind a $2.5\\%$ bias on the primordial amplitude $\\sigma_8$ that can not easily\nbe resolved by continued training. We correct this bias to obtain unprecedented\naccuracy in the cosmological parameter estimation with statistical\nuncertainties of $\\delta \\Omega_m$=0.0015 and $\\delta \\sigma_8$=0.0029, which\nare several times better than the results of previous CNN works. Compared with\na 2-point analysis method using clustering region of 0-130 and 10-130 $h^{-1}$\nMpc, the CNN constraints are several times and an order of magnitude more\nprecise, respectively. Finally, we conduct preliminary checks of the\nerror-tolerance abilities of the neural network, and find that it exhibits\nrobustness against smoothing, masking, random noise, global variation,\nrotation, reflection, and simulation resolution. Those effects are well\nunderstood in typical clustering analysis, but had not been tested before for\nthe CNN approach. Our work shows that CNN can be more promising than people\nexpected in deriving tight cosmological constraints from the cosmic large scale\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 07:57:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Jan 2020 15:31:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 02:35:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2020 01:13:46 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 13:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

The family also includes the widely-used double-metal\ncyanide (DMC) catalysts and the topical hexacyanoferrate/hexacyanomanganate\n(HCF/HCM) battery materials. Central to the various physical properties of PBAs\nis the ability to transport mass reversibly, a process made possible by\nstructural vacancies. Normally presumed random, vacancy arrangements are\nactually crucially important because they control the connectivity of the\nmicropore network, and hence diffusivity and adsorption profiles. The\nlong-standing obstacle to characterising PBA vacancy networks has always been\nthe relative inaccessibility of single-crystal samples. Here we report the\ngrowth of single crystals of a range of PBAs. By measuring and interpreting\ntheir X-ray diffuse scattering patterns, we identify for the first time a\nstriking diversity of non-random vacancy arrangements that is hidden from\nconventional crystallographic analysis of powder samples. Moreover, we show\nthat this unexpected phase complexity can be understood in terms of a\nremarkably simple microscopic model based on local rules of electroneutrality\nand centrosymmetry.

This paper focuses on emotion recognition from speech data, in\nsettings where it is desirable to minimize memory and computational\nrequirements. Reducing the number of features for inductive inference is a\nroute towards this goal. In this study, we evaluate three different\nstate-of-the-art feature selection methods: Infinite Latent Feature Selection\n(ILFS), ReliefF and Fisher (generalized Fisher score), and compare them to our\nrecently proposed feature selection method named `Active Feature Selection'\n(AFS). The evaluation is performed on three emotion recognition data sets\n(EmoDB, SAVEE and EMOVO) using two standard acoustic paralinguistic feature\nsets (i.e. eGeMAPs and emobase). The results show that similar or better\naccuracy can be achieved using subsets of features substantially smaller than\nthe entire feature set. A machine learning model trained on a smaller feature\nset will reduce the memory and computational resources of an emotion\nrecognition system which can result in lowering the barriers for use of health\nmonitoring technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 10:14:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 14:39:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

Novel functional applications of such research are expected in\nthe optimal parametric design of smart tunable mechanical filters and\ndirectional waveguides.

In our HST-COS and\n-STIS spectra, we find many emission lines, as well as substantial FUV\ncontinuum excess emission, which can be ascribed to active accretion. The total\nluminosity of the CIV 1549A doublet is 4.1$\\times10^{-4}$ Lsun.

We discuss possible reasons for the X-Shooter-HST discrepancy,\nthe most plausible being that the low contrast between the continuum excess\nemission and the photospheric+chromospheric emission at optical wavelengths in\nMYLup hampered detection of excess emission. The luminosity of the FUV\ncontinuum and CIV lines, strong H$_{2}$ fluorescence, and a \"1600 A Bump\" place\nMYLup in the class of accreting objects with gas-rich discs. So far, MYLup is\nthe only peculiar case in which a significant difference between the HST and\nX-Shooter Macc estimates exists that is not ascribable to variability.

Simple adiabatic models are inconsistent with the measured luminosity,\nwhich indicates that Uranus is non-adiabatic because it has thermal boundary\nlayers and/or conductive regions. A gradual composition distribution acts as a\nthermal boundary to suppress convection and slow down the internal cooling.\nHere we investigate whether composition gradients in the deep interior of\nUranus can explain its low luminosity, the required composition gradient, and\nwhether it is stable for convective mixing on a timescale of some billion\nyears. We varied the primordial composition distribution and the initial energy\nbudget of the planet, and chose the models that fit the currently measured\nproperties (radius, luminosity, and moment of inertia) of Uranus. We present\nseveral alternative non-adiabatic internal structures that fit the Uranus\nmeasurements. We found that convective mixing is limited to the interior of\nUranus, and a composition gradient is stable and sufficient to explain its\ncurrent luminosity. As a result, the interior of Uranus might still be very\nhot, in spite of its low luminosity. The stable composition gradient also\nindicates that the current internal structure of Uranus is similar to its\nprimordial structure. Moreover, we suggest that the initial energy content of\nUranus cannot be greater than 20% of its formation (accretion) energy. We also\nfind that an interior with a mixture of ice and rock, rather than separated ice\nand rock shells, is consistent with measurements, suggesting that Uranus might\nnot be \"differentiated\".

In it, players age with time and the\npayoff that they receive after each round \\text{depends on} their age. \\text{We\nfind that t}he outcome of the game is strongly influenced by the type of\ndistribution used to modify the payoffs according to the age of each player.\nThe results show that, under certain circumstances, cooperators may not only\nsurvive but dominate the population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 15:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-29"}

Here we present a\nsystematic study of vortex-induced phase shift in planar Josephson junctions.\nWe make two key observations: (i) The cutoff effect: although vortex-induce\nphase shift is a long-range phenomenon, it is terminated by the junction and\ndoes not persists beyond it. (ii) A crossover from linear to superlinear\ndependence of the phase shift on the vortex polar angle occurs upon approaching\nof the vortex to the junction. The crossover occurs at a distance comparable\nwith the penetration depth.

The short range mechanism is due to circulating vortex\ncurrents {\\it inside} superconducting electrodes without involvement of\nmagnetic field. The long range mechanism is due to stray magnetic fields {\\it\noutside} electrodes without circulating vortex currents.

Although substantial progress has been made in past years,\nthe explainability of existing methods is still limited. In this work, we\npropose a novel action reasoning framework that uses prior knowledge to explain\nsemantic-level observations of video state changes. Our method takes advantage\nof both classical reasoning and modern deep learning approaches. Specifically,\nprior knowledge is defined as the information of a target video domain,\nincluding a set of objects, attributes and relationships in the target video\ndomain, as well as relevant actions defined by the temporal attribute and\nrelationship changes (i.e. state transitions). Given a video sequence, we first\ngenerate a scene graph on each frame to represent concerned objects, attributes\nand relationships. Then those scene graphs are linked by tracking objects\nacross frames to form a spatio-temporal graph (also called video graph), which\nrepresents semantic-level video states. Finally, by sequentially examining each\nstate transition in the video graph, our method can detect and explain how\nthose actions are executed with prior knowledge, just like the logical manner\nof thinking by humans. Compared to previous works, the action reasoning results\nof our method can be explained by both logical rules and semantic-level\nobservations of video content changes. Besides, the proposed method can be used\nto detect multiple concurrent actions with detailed information, such as who\n(particular objects), when (time), where (object locations) and how (what kind\nof changes).

With the advanced\ntechniques of deep neural networks, the accuracy has been significantly\nimproved, however, the speed is still far below the real-time needs because of\nthe complicated network design, such as the requirement of the first frame\nfine-tuning step. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mask transfer\nnetwork (MTN), which can greatly boost the processing speed of VOS and also\nachieve a reasonable accuracy. The basic idea of MTN is to transfer the\nreference mask to the target frame via an efficient global pixel matching\nstrategy. The global pixel matching between the reference frame and the target\nframe is to ensure good matching results. To enhance the matching speed, we\nperform the matching on a downsampled feature map with 1/32 of the original\nframe size. At the same time, to preserve the detailed mask information in such\na small feature map, a mask network is designed to encode the annotated mask\ninformation with 512 channels. Finally, an efficient feature warping method is\nused to transfer the encoded reference mask to the target frame. Based on this\ndesign, our method avoids the fine-tuning step on the first frame and does not\nrely on the temporal cues and particular object categories. Therefore, it runs\nvery fast and can be conveniently trained only with images, as well as being\nrobust to unseen objects. Experiments on the DAVIS datasets demonstrate that\nMTN can achieve a speed of 37 fps, and also shows a competitive accuracy in\ncomparison to the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 13:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-29"}

Furthermore, there is no evidence for\nthe $r$-process to have a significant time delay relative to core-collapse\nsupernovae. Neutron star mergers are therefore unlikely the dominant (or only)\nnucleosynthetic site of the $r$-process. However, the products of the\n$s$-process only become apparent at $\\text{[Fe/H]}\\approx-2$ in Sculptor, and\nthe $s$-process becomes the dominant source of Ba at $\\text{[Fe/H]}\\gtrsim-2$.\nWe test the use of [Y/Mg] and [Ba/Mg] as chemical clocks in Sculptor. Similarly\nto what is observed in the Milky Way, [Y/Mg] and [Ba/Mg] increase towards\nyounger ages. However, there is an offset, where the abundance ratios of [Y/Mg]\nin Sculptor are significantly lower than those of the Milky Way at any given\nage. This is most likely caused by metallicity dependence of yields from the\n$s$-process, as well as different relative contribution of the $s$-process to\ncore-collapse supernovae in these galaxies. Comparisons of our data with that\nof the Milky Way and the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy furthermore show that\nthese chemical clocks are both metallicity and environment dependent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 13:59:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Aug 2019 12:36:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 16:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-20"}

In this framework, we study joint active\nand passive precoding design for IRS-assisted mmWave systems, where multiple\nIRSs are deployed to assist the data transmission from a base station (BS) to a\nsingle-antenna receiver. Our objective is to maximize the received signal power\nby jointly optimizing the transmit precoding vector at the BS and the phase\nshift parameters used by IRSs for passive beamforming. Although such an\noptimization problem is generally non-convex, we show that, by exploiting some\nimportant characteristics of mmWave channels, an optimal closed-form solution\ncan be derived for the single IRS case and a near-optimal analytical solution\ncan be obtained for the multi-IRS case. Our analysis reveals that the received\nsignal power increases quadratically with the number of reflecting elements for\nboth the single IRS and multi-IRS cases. Simulation results are included to\nverify the optimality and near-optimality of our proposed solutions. Results\nalso show that IRSs can help create effective virtual LOS paths and thus\nsubstantially improve robustness against blockages in mmWave communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 14:07:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 13:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

To avoid the virtual file system (VFS) and\nsyscall overhead as in these kernel-based file systems, recent works deploy\nfile systems directly in user level. Unfortunately, a userlevel file system can\neasily be corrupted by a buggy program with misused pointers, and is hard to\nscale on multi-core platforms which incorporates a centralized coordination\nservice. In this paper, we propose KucoFS, a Kernel and user-level\ncollaborative file system. It consists of two parts: a user-level library with\ndirect-access interfaces, and a kernel thread, which performs metadata updates\nand enforces write protection by toggling the permission bits in the page\ntable. Hence, KucoFS achieves both direct-access of user-level designs and\nfine-grained write protection of kernel-level ones. We further explore its\nscalability to multicores: For metadata scalability, KucoFS rebalances the\npathname resolution overhead between the kernel and userspace, by adopting the\nindex offloading technique. For data access efficiency, it coordinates the data\nallocation between kernel and userspace, and uses range-lock write and\nlock-free read to improve concurrency. Experiments on Optane DC persistent\nmemory show that KucoFS significantly outperforms existing file systems and\nshows better scalability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 14:15:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-29"}

Determining the\nproperties of lower hybrid waves is crucial because they are thought to\ncontribute to electron and ion heating, cross-field particle diffusion,\nanomalous resistivity, and energy transfer between electrons and ions. All\nthese processes could play an important role in magnetic reconnection at the\nmagnetopause and the evolution of the boundary layer. In this paper, the\nproperties of lower hybrid waves at Earth's magnetopause are investigated using\nthe Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. For the first time, the properties\nof the waves are investigated using fields and direct particle measurements.\nThe highest-resolution electron moments resolve the velocity and density\nfluctuations of lower hybrid waves, confirming that electrons remain\napproximately frozen in at lower hybrid wave frequencies. Using fields and\nparticle moments the dispersion relation is constructed and the wave-normal\nangle is estimated to be close to $90^{\\circ}$ to the background magnetic\nfield. The waves are shown to have a finite parallel wave vector, suggesting\nthat they can interact with parallel propagating electrons. The observed wave\nproperties are shown to agree with theoretical predictions, the previously used\nsingle-spacecraft method, and four-spacecraft timing analyses. These results\nshow that single-spacecraft methods can accurately determine lower hybrid wave\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 14:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

The corresponding corrections\nmust be taken into account for reliable results at non-linear orders. This can\nbe accomplished by introducing an orthonormal basis, or \"tetrad\", at the\nobserver point, representing the frame with respect to which observations are\nperformed. In this work we consider the tetrad formulation of General\nRelativity, thus associating tetrads to sources as well, and develop a new\nformalism for describing cosmological observables associated with localized\nsources. It is based on a manifold which we call the \"observer space-time\",\nwhose coordinates are the proper time, redshift and angles an observer uses to\nparametrize measurements, and on which the rest of the observables are defined.\nThis manifold does not have to be diffeomorphic to the true space-time and\nallows us to resolve caustics in the latter, in contrast to similar\ncoordinate-based formalisms.

As for the observables associated to the CMB, they lie inside the\nphase space distribution of the photon fluid, so we also revisit the\nconstruction of general-relativistic matrix kinetic theory from the tetrad\nformalism viewpoint.

The\nproposed particle-gas hybrid scheme has been designed to work in Cartesian as\nwell as in cylindrical and spherical geometries. The numerical method relies on\na Godunov-type second-order scheme for the fluid and an exponential midpoint\nrule for dust particles which overcomes the stiffness introduced by the linear\ncoupling term. Besides being time-reversible and globally second-order accurate\nin time, the exponential integrator provides energy errors which are always\nbounded and it remains stable in the limit of arbitrarily small particle\nstopping times yielding the correct asymptotic solution. Such properties make\nthis method preferable to the more widely used semi-implicit or fully implicit\nschemes at a very modest increase in computational cost. Coupling between\nparticles and grid quantities is achieved through particle deposition and\nfield-weighting techniques borrowed from Particle-In-Cell simulation methods.\nIn this respect, we derive new weight factors in curvilinear coordinates that\nare more accurate than traditional volume- or area-weighting.\n  A comprehensive suite of numerical benchmarks is presented to assess the\naccuracy and robustness of the algorithm in Cartesian, cylindrical and\nspherical coordinates. Particular attention is devoted to the streaming\ninstability which is analyzed in both local and global disk models.

The potential due to charges embedded in layered\nmedia is decomposed into a free space component and four types of reaction\nfield components, and the latter can be associated with the potential of a\npolarization source defined for each type. New multipole expansions (MEs) and\nlocal expansions (LEs), as well as the multipole to local (M2L) translation\noperators are derived for the reaction components, based on which the FMMs for\nreaction components are then proposed. The resulting FMM for charge\ninteractions in layered media is a combination of using the classic FMM for the\nfree space components and the new FMMs for the reaction field components. With\nthe help of a recurrence formula for the run-time computation of the\nSommerfeld-type integrals used in M2L translation operators, pre-computations\nof a large number of tables are avoided. The new FMMs for the reaction\ncomponents are found to be much faster than the classic FMM for the free space\ncomponents due to the separation of equivalent polarization charges and the\nassociated target charges by a material interface. As a result, the FMM for\npotential in layered media costs almost the same as the classic FMM in the free\nspace case.

As\ndeep network approaches learn the inverse mapping directly from the CS\nmeasurements, the reconstruction speed is significantly faster than the\nconventional CS algorithms. However, for existing network based approaches, a\nCS sampling procedure has to map a separate network model. This may potentially\ndegrade the performance of image CS with block-wise sampling because of\nblocking artifacts, especially when multiple sampling rates are assigned to\ndifferent blocks within an image. In this paper, we develop a multichannel deep\nnetwork for block-based image CS by exploiting inter-block correlation with\nperformance significantly exceeding the current state-of-the-art methods. The\nsignificant performance improvement is attributed to block-wise approximation\nbut full image removal of blocking artifacts. Specifically, with our\nmultichannel structure, the image blocks with a variety of sampling rates can\nbe reconstructed in a single model. The initially reconstructed blocks are then\ncapable of being reassembled into a full image to improve the recovered images\nby unrolling a hand-designed block based CS recovery algorithm.

This is a numeric method capable of determining the\nimpact for every loop in a model and identifying which dominate behavior at\neach point in time. The method was inspired by observations on variable value\nchanges during simulations and has been refined using empirical evaluation on a\nvariety of different models. In addition to explaining behavior, the method\nshows promise for improving visualization and aggregation of simulation\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 17:28:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 22:14:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

The\nsearch strategy focused on articles applying ML to high-grade glioma biomarkers\nfor treatment response monitoring, prognosis, and prediction.\n  Results: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically used throughout the\npatient pathway because routine structural imaging provides detailed anatomical\nand pathological information and advanced techniques provide additional\nphysiological detail. Using carefully chosen image features, ML is frequently\nused to allow accurate classification in a variety of scenarios. Rather than\nbeing chosen by human selection, ML also enables image features to be\nidentified by an algorithm.
