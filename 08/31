Their proper\ntheoretical description requires the functional renormalization group. We show\nthat their critical behavior close to the depinning transition is related to a\nmuch simpler model, $O(n)$-symmetric $\\phi^4$ theory in the unusual limit of\n$n\\to -2$. We demonstrate that both theories yield identical results to 4-loop\norder and give both a perturbative and a non-perturbative proof of their\nequivalence. As we show, both theories can be used to describe loop-erased\nrandom walks (LERWs), the trace of a random walk where loops are erased as soon\nas they are formed. Remarkably, two famous models of non-self-intersecting\nrandom walks, self-avoiding walks (SAWs) and LERWs, can both be mapped onto\n$\\phi^4$ theory taken, with formally $n=0$ and $n\\to -2$ components. This\nmapping allows us to compute the dynamic critical exponent of CDWs at the\ndepinning transition and the fractal dimension of LERWs in $d=3$ with\nunprecedented accuracy, $z(d=3)= 1.6243 \\pm 0.001$, in excellent agreement with\nthe estimate $z = 1.624 00 \\pm 0.00005$ of numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 16:06:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 13:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

Here we focus on robustness with\nrespect to tuning parameters, showing that more sophisticated algorithms tend\nto be more sensitive to the choice of step-size parameter and less robust to\nheterogeneity of the distribution of interest. We characterise this phenomenon\nby studying the behaviour of spectral gaps as an increasingly poor step-size is\nchosen for the algorithm. Motivated by these considerations, we propose a novel\nand simple gradient-based MCMC algorithm, inspired by the classical Barker\naccept-reject rule, with improved robustness properties. Extensive theoretical\nresults, dealing with robustness to tuning, geometric ergodicity and scaling\nwith dimension, suggest that the novel scheme combines the robustness of simple\nschemes with the efficiency of gradient-based ones.

Our key idea is to map small image elements to\nfeature representations extracted from a sequence of nested regions of\nincreasing spatial extent. These regions are obtained by \"zooming out\" from the\npixel/superpixel all the way to scene-level resolution, and hence we call these\nzoom-out features. Applied to semantic segmentation and other structured\nprediction tasks, our approach exploits statistical structure in the image and\nin the label space without setting up explicit structured prediction\nmechanisms, and thus avoids complex and expensive inference. Instead image\nelements are classified by a feedforward multilayer network with skip-layer\nconnections spanning the zoom-out levels. When used in conjunction with modern\nneural architectures such as ResNet, DenseNet and NASNet (to which it is\ncomplementary) our approach achieves competitive accuracy on segmentation\nbenchmarks.\n  In addition, we propose an approach for learning category-level semantic\nsegmentation purely from image-level classification tag.

We here study how four different commonly\nconsidered initial-stage scenarios which have the same temperature profile\nafter, but differ in the 'temperature' profile before thermalization affect\npredictions of high-pT RAA and v2 observables. Contrary to common expectations,\nwe obtain that high-pT v2 is insensitive to the initial stages of medium\nevolution, being unable to discriminate between different conditions.

On the other hand, if a global property, in particular the same\naverage temperature, is imposed to tested temperature profiles, high\nsensitivity of high-pT v2 is again obtained. We however show that this\nsensitivity would not be a consequence of differences in initial, but rather\nfinal, stages. Consequently, the simultaneous study of high-pT RAA and v2, with\nconsistent energy loss parametrization and stringently controlled temperature\nprofiles, is necessary to assess sensitivity of different variables to\ndifferences in initial and final stages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 17:57:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Despite an abundance of detections, their nature remains elusive. At\nleast a subset of FRBs is expected to repeat, as the daily FRB rate surpasses\nthat of any known cataclysmic event, which has been confirmed by observations.\nOne of the proposed mechanisms to generate repeating FRBs is supergiant pulses\nfrom young and highly spinning NSs, in which case FRBs could inherit the\nperiodicity of their parent NS. Here we examine the consequences of such a\npopulation of periodic fast radio bursts (PFRBs).

We propose several tests of this\nhypothesis. First, the period of PFRBs would increase over time, and their\nluminosity would decrease, due to the NS spin-down. Second, PFRBs may show\nmodest amounts of rotation measure, given the lack of expelled matter from the\npulsar, as opposed to the magnetar-sourced FRBs proposed to explain the first\nrepeater FRB 121102. As an example, we study whether the second confirmed\nrepeater (FRB 180814) is a PFRB, given the preference for an inter-pulse\nseparation of 13 ms within its sub-bursts.

To overcome this, we develop new finite sample\nhypothesis tests for dynamic watermarking in the case of bounded disturbances,\nusing the modern theory of concentration of measure for random matrices. Our\nresulting switching strategy is validated with a simulation analysis in an\nautonomous driving setting, which demonstrates the strong performance of our\nproposed policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 18:03:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

However, generating supercontinua that\nare both coherent and broadband requires pulses that are simultaneously\nultrashort with high peak power. This results in a reducing efficiency with\nincreasing pulse repetition rate, that has hindered supercontinua at microwave\nline spacing, i.e. 10s of GHz. Soliton microcombs by contrast, can generate\noctave-spanning spectra, but with good conversion efficiency only at vastly\nhigher repetition rates in the 100s of GHz. Here, we bridge this efficiency gap\nwith resonant supercontinuum, allowing supercontinuum generation using input\npulses with an ultra-low 6 picojoule energy, and duration of 1 picosecond,\n10-fold longer than what is typical. By applying synchronous pulse-driving to a\ndispersion-engineered, low-loss Si$_3$N$_4$ photonic chip microresonator, we\ngenerate dissipative Kerr solitons with a strong dispersive wave, both bound to\nthe input pulse. This creates a smooth, flattened 2,200 line frequency comb,\nwith an electronically detectable repetition rate of 28 GHz, constituting the\nlargest bandwidth-line-count product for any microcomb generated to date.\nStrikingly, we observe that solitons exist in a weakly bound state with the\ninput pulse, stabilizing their repetition rate, but simultaneously allowing\nnoise transfer from one to the other to be suppressed even for offset\nfrequencies 100 times lower than the linear cavity decay rate. We demonstrate\nthat this nonlinear filtering can be enhanced by pulse-driving asynchronously,\nin order to preserve the coherence of the comb.

Enstrophy serves as a convenient indicator\nof the regularity of solutions to the Navier Stokes system --- as long as this\nquantity remains finite, the solutions are guaranteed to be smooth and satisfy\nthe equations in the classical (pointwise) sense. However, there are no\nestimates available with finite a priori bounds on the growth of enstrophy and\nhence the regularity problem for the 3D Navier-Stokes system remains open. In\norder to quantify the maximum possible growth of enstrophy, we consider a\nfamily of PDE optimization problems in which initial conditions with prescribed\nenstrophy $\\mathcal{E}_0$ are sought such that the enstrophy in the resulting\nNavier-Stokes flow is maximized at some time $T$. Such problems are solved\ncomputationally using a large-scale adjoint-based gradient approach derived in\nthe continuous setting.

Thus, in such worst-case scenario the enstrophy\nstill remains bounded for all times and there is no evidence for formation of\nsingularity in finite time.

Strikingly the experimental data show anomalous desorption kinetics,\nevident as a surface dwell time that exhibits a power-law distribution, i.e. a\nheavy-tailed rather than the expected exponential distribution. As a direct\nconsequence of this heavy-tailed distribution, the average desorption rate\ndepends upon the time scale of the experiment and the protein surface\nconcentration does not reach equilibrium.

In each of these cases, the purpose of the risk assessment tool is\nto inform actions, such as medical treatments or release conditions, often with\nthe aim of reducing the likelihood of an adverse event such as hospital\nreadmission or recidivism. Problematically, most tools are trained and\nevaluated on historical data in which the outcomes observed depend on the\nhistorical decision-making policy. These tools thus reflect risk under the\nhistorical policy, rather than under the different decision options that the\ntool is intended to inform. Even when tools are constructed to predict risk\nunder a specific decision, they are often improperly evaluated as predictors of\nthe target outcome.\n  Focusing on the evaluation task, in this paper we define counterfactual\nanalogues of common predictive performance and algorithmic fairness metrics\nthat we argue are better suited for the decision-making context.

Second, it discards the hand-designed heuristics and\nincorporates a hierarchical masking scheme that automatically learns and\ndetermines the optimal architecture. Compared to state-of-the-art weight\nsharing based approaches, HM-NAS is able to achieve better architecture search\nperformance and competitive model evaluation accuracy. Without the constraint\nimposed by the hand-designed heuristics, our searched networks contain more\nflexible and meaningful architectures that existing weight sharing based NAS\napproaches are not able to discover.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Aug 2019 04:02:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Sep 2019 08:33:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

We\ninvestigate how the pion mean fields are created by the presence of $N_c$,\n$N_c-1$, and $N_c-2$ light valence quarks, which correspond to the systems of\nlight baryons, singly heavy baryons, and doubly heavy baryons. As the number of\ncolor decreases from $N_c$ to $N_c-1$, the pion mean fields undergo changes. As\na result, the valence-quark contributions to the moments of inertia of the\nsoliton become larger than the case of the $N_c$ valence quarks, whereas the\nsea-quark contributions decrease systematically. On the other hand, the\npresence of the $N_c-2$ valence quarks is not enough to produce the strong pion\nmean fields, which leads to the fact that the classical soliton can not be\nformed. It indicates that the pion mean-field approach is not suitable to\ndescribe doubly heavy baryons. We show that the mass spectra of the singly\nheavy baryons are better described by the improved pion mean fields, compared\nwith the previous work in which the pion mean fields are assumed to be intact\nwith $N_c$ varied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Aug 2019 04:16:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 01:00:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

This re-representation process essentially maps those variables\ninto a latent space called the \\emph{embedding space}. The benefit of this is\nthat such spaces allow for richer nuances than the typical transformations used\nin categorical variables (e.g. dummy encoding, contrasted encoding, principal\ncomponents analysis). While the usage of latent variable representations is not\nnew per se in travel demand modeling, the idea presented here brings several\ninnovations: it is an entirely data driven algorithm; it is informative and\nconsistent, since the latent space can be visualized and interpreted based on\ndistances between different categories; it preserves interpretability of\ncoefficients, despite being based on Neural Network principles; and it is\ntransferrable, in that embeddings learned from one dataset can be reused for\nother ones, as long as travel behavior keeps consistent between the datasets.\n  The idea is strongly inspired on natural language processing techniques,\nnamely the word2vec algorithm. Such algorithm is behind recent developments\nsuch as in automatic translation or next word prediction. Our method is\ndemonstrated using a model choice model, and shows improvements of up to 60\\%\nwith respect to initial likelihood, and up to 20% with respect to likelihood of\nthe corresponding traditional model (i.e. using dummy variables) in\nout-of-sample evaluation.

In this review we focus on electronic and\nspin excitations in Fe-based pnictides and chalcogenides in particular, but not\nexclusively superconductors. After a general introduction to the basic theory\nincluding the selection rules for the various scattering processes we provide\nan overview over the major results. In the superconducting state below the\ntransition temperature Tc the pair-breaking effect can be observed, and the\nenergy gap can be derived. The energies can be associated with the gaps and\ntheir anisotropy on the electron and hole bands. In spite of the similarities\nof the overall band structures the results are strongly dependent on the family\nand may even change qualitatively within one family. In some of the compounds\nstrong collective modes appear below Tc. In Ba1-xKxFe2As2, which has the most\nisotropic gap of all Fe-based superconductors, there are indications that these\nmodes are exciton-like states appearing in the presence of a hierarchy of\npairing tendencies. The strong in-gap modes observed in Co-doped NaFeAs are\ninterpreted in terms of quadrupolar orbital excitations which become undamped\nin the superconducting state. The doping dependence of the scattering intensity\nin Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 is associated with a nematic resonance above a quantum\ncritical point and interpreted in terms of a critical enhancement at the\nmaximal Tc. In the normal state the response from particle-hole excitations\nreflects the resistivity. In addition, there are contributions from presumably\ncritical fluctuations in the energy range of kBT which can be compared to the\nelastic properties.

Specifically, we first\ncalculate cross-lingual n-gram embeddings and infer an n-gram translation table\nfrom them. With those n-gram translation pairs, we propose a new pre-training\nmodel called Cross-lingual Masked Language Model (CMLM), which randomly chooses\nsource n-grams in the input text stream and predicts their translation\ncandidates at each time step. Experiments show that our method can incorporate\nbeneficial cross-lingual information into pre-trained models. Taking\npre-trained CMLM models as the encoder and decoder, we significantly improve\nthe performance of unsupervised machine translation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Aug 2019 09:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

In particular, we discuss the case of logical\nconstraints expressed by Lukasiewicz logic, where both inferential and\nalgebraic arguments can be considered. Some theoretical results that\ncharacterize the concept of unnecessary constraint are proved and explained by\nmeans of examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Aug 2019 14:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 13:38:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

In this\npaper, we advocate a distinction between two different types of uncertainty,\nreferred to as epistemic and aleatoric, in the context of active learning.\nRoughly speaking, these notions capture the reducible and the irreducible part\nof the total uncertainty in a prediction, respectively. We conjecture that, in\nuncertainty sampling, the usefulness of an instance is better reflected by its\nepistemic than by its aleatoric uncertainty.

Although many\ncomputational methods have been proposed to reconstruct a densely-sampled LF\nfrom a sparsely-sampled one, they still suffer from either low reconstruction\nquality, low computational efficiency, or the restriction on the regularity of\nthe sampling pattern. To this end, we propose a novel learning-based method,\nwhich accepts sparsely-sampled LFs with irregular structures, and produces\ndensely-sampled LFs with arbitrary angular resolution accurately and\nefficiently. We also propose a simple yet effective method for optimizing the\nsampling pattern. Our proposed method, an end-to-end trainable network,\nreconstructs a densely-sampled LF in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, the\ncoarse sub-aperture image (SAI) synthesis module first explores the scene\ngeometry from an unstructured sparsely-sampled LF and leverages it to\nindependently synthesize novel SAIs, in which a confidence-based blending\nstrategy is proposed to fuse the information from different input SAIs, giving\nan intermediate densely-sampled LF. Then, the efficient LF refinement module\nlearns the angular relationship within the intermediate result to recover the\nLF parallax structure. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method on both real-world and synthetic LF images when\ncompared with state-of-the-art methods.

In the present study, within the\nframework of the squirmer model, we impose a tangential velocity at the swimmer\nsurface as a representation of the ciliatory propulsion and subsequently obtain\nexact solution of the Stokes equation based on a combined analytical-numerical\napproach. We illustrate how the near-wall swimming velocities are non-trivially\naltered by the interaction of wall slip and hydrodynamic forces. We report a\ncharacteristic transition of swimming trajectories for both puller and pusher\ntype microswimmers by hydrodynamic slippage if the wall-slip length crosses a\ncritical value. In case of puller microswimmers that are propelled by a\nbreast-stroke like action of their swimming apparatus ahead of their cell body,\nthe wall slip can cause wall-bound trapping swimming states, either as periodic\nor damped periodic oscillations which would otherwise escape from a no slip\nwall. The associated critical slip length has a non-monotonic dependence on the\ninitial orientation of the swimmer which is represented by novel phase\ndiagrams. Pushers, which get their propulsive thrust from posterior flagellar\naction, also show similar swimming state transitions but in this case the wall\nslip mediated reorientation dynamics and the swimming modes compete in a\ndifferent fashion to that of the pullers.

In the special theory of relativity,\nout of these three only the description of force (F=dp/dt) does not raise\ndoubts. The greatest problems are posed by mass, which may be invariant rest\nmass or relativistic mass or even directional mass like longitudinal mass. This\nresults from breaking the assumption of parallelism of force and standard\nacceleration. It turns out that these issues disappear if the relativistic\nacceleration A is defined as a relativistic velocity subtraction formula. This\nbasic fact is obscured by some subtlety related to the calculation of the\nrelativistic differential of velocity. It is based on the direction of force\nrather than on transformation to a resting system. The reference to a\nnon-resting system generates a (seemingly) different velocity subtraction\nformula. Thus, the relativistic three-dimensional acceleration is neither rest\nacceleration, nor four-acceleration, nor standard acceleration.

It bears two distinguished properties just like a tree:\n\"far more small things than large ones\" across all scales, and \"more or less\nsimilar things\" on each scale. As a physical phenomenon, and mathematical\nconcept, living structure is essentially empirical, discovered and developed\nfrom miniscule observation in nature- and human-made things, and it affects our\ndaily lives in some substantial ways, such as where to put a table or a flower\nvase in a room, helping us to make beautiful things and environments. Living\nstructure is not only empirical, but also philosophical and visionary, enabling\nus to see the world and space in more meaningful ways. This paper is intended\nto defend living structure as a physical phenomenon, clarifying some common\nquestions and misgivings surrounding Alexander's design thoughts, such as the\nobjective or structural nature of beauty, building styles advocated by\nAlexander, and mysterious nature of his concepts. We first illustrate living\nstructure - essentially organized complexity, as advocated by the late Jane\nJacobs (1916-2006) - that is governed by two fundamental laws (scaling law and\nTobler's law), and generated in some step by step fashion by two design\nprinciples (differentiation and adaptation) through the 15 structural\nproperties. We then verify why living structure is primarily empirical, drawing\nevidence from Alexander's own work, as well as our case studies applied to the\nEarth's surface including cities, streets, and buildings, and two logos. Before\nreaching conclusions, we concentrate on the most mysterious part of Alexander's\nwork - the hypothesized \"I\" - as a substance that pervasively exists\neverywhere, in order to make better sense of living structure in our minds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 19:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-27"}

This article is a critique\nof now mainstream belief of such dichotomy through re-reading of Leibniz's idea\non the unity of knowledge. The distinctive feature of Leibniz's approach, which\nwas specifically laid down in his correspondence with Clarke, is that his way\nof reasoning is philosophical as well as physical.

We shall also demonstrate that Chaos Theory is consistent with the\naffinities of Leibniz's approach. The main focus of this article is on\nre-evaluating views on causal determinism and randomness as well as free will.\nThe final claim of this article is that the natural world and human world\nfollow the same causal deterministic laws, and that causal laws are however\nnonlinear. Knowledge of our reality should be rigorously sought in both the\ndomains of humanities and natural sciences, but this causal determinism should\ndistance itself from a simple linear causal model. What is thought of as random\nevents or probabilistic events in the physical world, as well as in the human\nworld, are not ontologically run by chance. The complexity and vastness of\nreality are such that our knowledge of reality always suffers a lack, and it is\nthis lack of knowledge that is usually being called randomness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 17:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-01"}
