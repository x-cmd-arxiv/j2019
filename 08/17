Recent papers have proved this statement theoretically\nfor highly overparametrized networks under reasonable assumptions. These\nresults either assume that the activation function is ReLU or they crucially\ndepend on the minimum eigenvalue of a certain Gram matrix depending on the\ndata, random initialization and the activation function. In the later case,\nexisting works only prove that this minimum eigenvalue is non-zero and do not\nprovide quantitative bounds. On the empirical side, a contemporary line of\ninvestigations has proposed a number of alternative activation functions which\ntend to perform better than ReLU at least in some settings but no clear\nunderstanding has emerged. This state of affairs underscores the importance of\ntheoretically understanding the impact of activation functions on training. In\nthe present paper, we provide theoretical results about the effect of\nactivation function on the training of highly overparametrized 2-layer neural\nnetworks. A crucial property that governs the performance of an activation is\nwhether or not it is smooth. For non-smooth activations such as ReLU, SELU and\nELU, all eigenvalues of the associated Gram matrix are large under minimal\nassumptions on the data. For smooth activations such as tanh, swish and\npolynomials, the situation is more complex. If the subspace spanned by the data\nhas small dimension then the minimum eigenvalue of the Gram matrix can be small\nleading to slow training. But if the dimension is large and the data satisfies\nanother mild condition, then the eigenvalues are large. If we allow deep\nnetworks, then the small data dimension is not a limitation provided that the\ndepth is sufficient. We discuss a number of extensions and applications of\nthese results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 16:22:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 2019 14:37:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 09:39:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 13:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-13"}

Finally, we turn to multivariate\ndifferences, constructing a set of order $N^{1/2}$ lacking a difference equal\nto a sum of two squares. This is in contrast to the analogous problem of sets\nlacking a difference equal to a prime minus one, where the current record is of\norder $N^{o(1)}.$\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 16:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

One way to obtain such an approximation is to apply\ncolumn subset selection to $A$ and $A^T$. In this work, we describe a\nnumerically robust and much faster variant of the column subset selection\nalgorithm proposed by Deshpande and Rademacher, which guarantees an error close\nto the best approximation error in the Frobenius norm. For cross approximation,\nin which $U$ is required to be the inverse of a submatrix of $A$ described by\nthe intersection of $C$ and $R$, we obtain a new algorithm with an error bound\nthat stays within a factor $k + 1$ of the best rank-$k$ approximation error in\nthe Frobenius norm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\ndeterministic polynomial-time algorithm for which this factor is bounded by a\npolynomial in $k$. Our derivation and analysis of the algorithm is based on\nderandomizing a recent existence result by Zamarashkin and Osinsky. To\nillustrate the versatility of our new column subset selection algorithm, an\nextension to low multilinear rank approximations of tensors is provided as\nwell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 17:08:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-19"}

One popular\ncommunication-compression method for data-parallel SGD is QSGD (Alistarh et\nal., 2017), which quantizes and encodes gradients to reduce communication\ncosts. The baseline variant of QSGD provides strong theoretical guarantees,\nhowever, for practical purposes, the authors proposed a heuristic variant which\nwe call QSGDinf, which demonstrated impressive empirical gains for distributed\ntraining of large neural networks. In this paper, we build on this work to\npropose a new gradient quantization scheme, and show that it has both stronger\ntheoretical guarantees than QSGD, and matches and exceeds the empirical\nperformance of the QSGDinf heuristic and of other compression methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 17:59:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 21:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

However, models learned on synthetic images often do not\ngeneralize well to real images due to the domain shift. Our key idea to improve\ndomain adaptation is to introduce a separate anchor task (such as facial\nlandmarks) whose annotations can be obtained at no cost or are already\navailable on both synthetic and real datasets. To further leverage the implicit\nrelationship between the anchor and main tasks, we apply our \\freeze technique\nthat learns the cross-task guidance on the source domain with the final network\nlayers, and use it on the target domain. We evaluate our methods on surface\nnormal estimation on two pairs of datasets (indoor scenes and faces) with two\nkinds of anchor tasks (semantic segmentation and facial landmarks). We show\nthat blindly applying domain adaptation or training the auxiliary task on only\none domain may hurt performance, while using anchor tasks on both domains is\nbetter behaved. Our \\freeze technique outperforms competing approaches,\nreaching performance in facial images on par with a recently popular surface\nnormal estimation method using shape from shading domain knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 17:59:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2020 18:58:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 01:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

Our models also suggest that stripped stars have harder ionizing\nspectra than massive stars.\n  The additional ionizing radiation affects observable properties that are\nrelated to the ionizing emission from stellar populations. In co-eval stellar\npopulations, the ionizing radiation from stripped stars increases the\nionization parameter and the production efficiency of HI-ionizing photons. They\nalso cause high values for these parameters for about ten times longer than\nwhat is predicted for massive stars. The hard ionizing radiation from stripped\nstars likely introduces a characteristic ionization structure of the nebula,\nwhich leads to the emission of highly ionized elements such as O$^{2+}$ and\nC$^{3+}$. We, therefore, expect that the presence of stripped stars affects the\nlocation in the BPT diagram and the diagnostic ratio of OIII to OII nebular\nemission lines.

Instead,\nthe relative difference arises because the photometric BBS sample is far more\ndispersed than known O-type stars.

We employ the\ndescription by a master equation for the electronic occupation numbers to\nanalyze the relative importance of both scattering mechanisms. The electronic\nand phononic band structures, as well as the matrix elements for\nelectron-phonon coupling within deformation potential theory were obtained from\ndensity functional calculations, thus taking into account quantum confinement\neffects. For the relaxation dynamics, the contribution of impact ionization\nprocesses to the lifetime is estimated from the imaginary part of the\nelectronic self-energy calculated in the GW approximation. By numerically\nsolving rate equations for the occupations of the Pb-derived electronic states\ncoupled to a phononic heat bath, we are able to follow the distribution of the\nelectronic excitation energy to the various modes of Pb lattice vibrations.\nWhile e-e scattering is the dominant relaxation mechanism, we demonstrate that\nthe e-ph scattering is highly phonon-mode-specific, with a large contribution\nfrom surface phonons.

The CCHP targets the halo of M101 where there is\nlittle to no host-galaxy dust, the red giant branch is isolated from nearly all\nother stellar populations, and there is virtually no source confusion or\ncrowding at the magnitude of the tip.

While\ndynamics following an abrupt quench of the pairing interaction strength in the\nsingle-band BCS model has been exactly solved due to the integrability of the\nmodel, the dynamics of post-quench multi-band superconductors remain under\nscrutiny.

The camera pose can be computed from 2D-3D matches between a\nquery image and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) models. Despite recent advances in\nIBL, it remains difficult to simultaneously resolve the memory consumption and\nmatch ambiguity problems of large SfM models. In this work, we propose a\ncascaded parallel filtering method that leverages the feature, visibility and\ngeometry information to filter wrong matches under binary feature\nrepresentation. The core idea is that we divide the challenging filtering task\ninto two parallel tasks before deriving an auxiliary camera pose for final\nfiltering. One task focuses on preserving potentially correct matches, while\nanother focuses on obtaining high quality matches to facilitate subsequent more\npowerful filtering. Moreover, our proposed method improves the localization\naccuracy by introducing a quality-aware spatial reconfiguration method and a\nprincipal focal length enhanced pose estimation method. Experimental results on\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves very competitive\nlocalization performances in a memory-efficient manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 19:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

In this work, we investigate the non-linear properties of this\nLorenz model both analytically and numerically. The significant feature of the\nmodel is the passage to chaos through a complete set of period-doubling\nbifurcations above the Hopf point for inverse Schmidt numbers above a critical\nvalue. Interestingly enough, at these Schmidt numbers a strange attractor and\nstable fixed points coexist beyond the homoclinic point. At the Hopf point, the\nstrange attractor disappears leaving a high-period periodic orbit. This\nperiodic state becomes the expected limit cycle through a set of bifurcations\nand then undergoes a sequence of period-doubling bifurcations leading to the\nformation of a strange attractor. This is the first situation where a\nLorenz-like model has shown a set of consecutive period-doubling bifurcations\nin a physically relevant transition to turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Aug 2019 06:00:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Sep 2019 08:39:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 05:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

A new class of improved Laplacian potential functions is\nproposed by presenting two notions of any signed digraph: induced unsigned\ndigraph and mirror (undirected) signed graph, based on which two distributed\naveraging protocols are designed using the nearest neighbor rules. It is shown\nthat with any of the designed protocols, signed-average consensus\n(respectively, state stability) can be achieved if and only if the associated\nsigned digraph of signed network is structurally balanced (respectively,\nunbalanced), regardless of whether weight balance is satisfied or not. Further,\nimproved Laplacian potential functions can be exploited to solve fixed-time\nconsensus problems of signed networks with directed topologies, in which a\nnonlinear distributed protocol is proposed to ensure the bipartite consensus or\nstate stability within a fixed time. Additionally, the convergence analyses of\ndirected signed networks can be implemented with the Lyapunov stability\nanalysis method, which is realized by revealing the tight relationship between\nconvergence behaviors of directed signed networks and properties of improved\nLaplacian potential functions.

However, the robust face recognition under a drastic change of the\nfacial pose, expression, and illumination is a big challenging problem for its\npractical application. Such variations make face recognition more difficult. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel face recognition method, called Attentional\nFeature-pair Relation Network (AFRN), which represents the face by the relevant\npairs of local appearance block features with their attention scores. The AFRN\nrepresents the face by all possible pairs of the 9x9 local appearance block\nfeatures, the importance of each pair is considered by the attention map that\nis obtained from the low-rank bilinear pooling, and each pair is weighted by\nits corresponding attention score. To increase the accuracy, we select top-K\npairs of local appearance block features as relevant facial information and\ndrop the remaining irrelevant. The weighted top-K pairs are propagated to\nextract the joint feature-pair relation by using bilinear attention network.

The\nsimilarity between the proposed Global Cracking Elements (GCE) and the standard\n9-node quadrilateral element (Q9) suggests a special procedure: the degrees of\nfreedom of the center node of the Q9, originally defining the displacements,\nare \"borrowed\" to describe the crack openings of the GCE. The proposed approach\ndoes not need remeshing, enrichment, or a crack-tracking strategy, and it\navoids a precise description of the crack tip.

The model is nonlinear, and the number of equations can be very\nlarge when the size of discrete mesh element is very small to achieve a\nprescribed accuracy, which may lead to an intensive equation solving process.\nIn this paper, an efficient radiation symmetry analysis approach based on\nsparse representation is presented, in which, 1) the Spherical harmonics,\nannular Zernike polynomials and Legendre-Fourier polynomials are employed to\nsparsely represent the radiation flux on the capsule and cylindrical cavity,\nand the nonlinear energy equilibrium equations are transformed into the\nequations with sparse coefficients, which means there are many redundant\nequations, 2) only a few equations are selected to recover such sparse\ncoefficients with Latin hypercube sampling, 3) a Conjugate Gradient Subspace\nThresholding Pursuit (CGSTP) algorithm is then given to rapidly obtain such\nsparse coefficients equation with as few iterations as possible.

Unlike centralized learning\ntaking place in a data center, FL usually operates in a wireless edge network\nwhere the communication medium is resource-constrained and unreliable. Due to\nlimited bandwidth, only a portion of UEs can be scheduled for updates at each\niteration. Due to the shared nature of the wireless medium, transmissions are\nsubjected to interference and are not guaranteed. The performance of FL system\nin such a setting is not well understood. In this paper, an analytical model is\ndeveloped to characterize the performance of FL in wireless networks.\nParticularly, tractable expressions are derived for the convergence rate of FL\nin a wireless setting, accounting for effects from both scheduling schemes and\ninter-cell interference. Using the developed analysis, the effectiveness of\nthree different scheduling policies, i.e., random scheduling (RS), round robin\n(RR), and proportional fair (PF), are compared in terms of FL convergence rate.\nIt is shown that running FL with PF outperforms RS and RR if the network is\noperating under a high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)\nthreshold, while RR is more preferable when the SINR threshold is low.\nMoreover, the FL convergence rate decreases rapidly as the SINR threshold\nincreases, thus confirming the importance of compression and quantization of\nthe update parameters. The analysis also reveals a trade-off between the number\nof scheduled UEs and subchannel bandwidth under a fixed amount of available\nspectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Aug 2019 10:32:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 08:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-10"}

However, existing general CNN\nface models generalize poorly to the scenario of occlusions on variable facial\nareas.

A mask dictionary is firstly established by exploiting the\ndifferences between the top convoluted features of occluded and occlusion-free\nface pairs using an innovatively designed Pairwise Differential Siamese Network\n(PDSN). Each item of this dictionary captures the correspondence between\noccluded facial areas and corrupted feature elements, which is named Feature\nDiscarding Mask (FDM). When dealing with a face image with random partial\nocclusions, we generate its FDM by combining relevant dictionary items and then\nmultiply it with the original features to eliminate those corrupted feature\nelements. Comprehensive experiments on both synthesized and realistic occluded\nface datasets show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Aug 2019 10:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

The online algorithm obtains the multicopter design results that\nsatisfy the given requirements by searching through the component combinations\nin the database and calculating the optimal parameters for the battery and\nairframe. Subsequently, these requirement-satisfied multicopter design results\nare obtained and sorted according to an objective function that contains\nevaluation indexes including size, weight, performance, and practicability. The\nproposed method has the advantages of high precision and quick calculating\nspeed because parameter calibrations and time-consuming calculations are\ncompleted offline. Experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness and\npracticality of the proposed method. Comparisons with the brutal search method\nand other design methods demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Aug 2019 13:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

We examine here the impact of mass uncertainties on\nspectral retrieval analyses for a host of atmospheric scenarios. Our approach\nis both analytical and numerical: we first use simple approximations to extract\nanalytically the influence of each parameter to the wavelength-dependent\ntransit depth. We then adopt a fully Bayesian retrieval model to quantify the\npropagation of the mass uncertainty onto other atmospheric parameters. We found\nthat for clear-sky, gaseous atmospheres the posterior distributions are the\nsame when the mass is known or retrieved. The retrieved mass is very accurate,\nwith a precision of more than 10%, provided the wavelength coverage and S/N are\nadequate. When opaque clouds are included in the simulations, the uncertainties\nin the retrieved mass increase, especially for high altitude clouds. However\natmospheric parameters such as the temperature and trace-gas abundances are\nunaffected by the knowledge of the mass. Secondary atmospheres are more\nchallenging due to the higher degree of freedom for the atmospheric main\ncomponent, which is unknown.

The development and proliferation of GANs raises an\ninteresting question: can we train a GAN to remove an object, if present, from\nan image while otherwise preserving the image? Specifically, can a GAN\n\"virtually heal\" anyone by turning his medical image, with an unknown health\nstatus (diseased or healthy), into a healthy one, so that diseased regions\ncould be revealed by subtracting those two images? Such a task requires a GAN\nto identify a minimal subset of target pixels for domain translation, an\nability that we call fixed-point translation, which no GAN is equipped with\nyet. Therefore, we propose a new GAN, called Fixed-Point GAN, trained by (1)\nsupervising same-domain translation through a conditional identity loss, and\n(2) regularizing cross-domain translation through revised adversarial, domain\nclassification, and cycle consistency loss. Based on fixed-point translation,\nwe further derive a novel framework for disease detection and localization\nusing only image-level annotation. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations\ndemonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art in\nmulti-domain image-to-image translation and that it surpasses predominant\nweakly-supervised localization methods in both disease detection and\nlocalization.

Such\nmodels are useful in the study of the structure and growth dynamics of gene\nregulatory networks and scientific citation networks. Starting from an initial\nseed network, at each time step a random node, referred to as a mother node, is\nselected for duplication. Its daughter node is added to the network and\nduplicates each outgoing link of the mother node with probability $p$. In\naddition, the daughter node forms a directed link to the mother node itself.\nThus, the model is referred to as the corded directed-node-duplication (DND)\nmodel. In this network not all pairs of nodes are connected by directed paths,\nin spite of the fact that the corresponding undirected network consists of a\nsingle connected component. More specifically, in the large network limit only\na diminishing fraction of pairs of nodes are connected by directed paths. To\ncalculate the DSPL between those pairs of nodes that are connected by directed\npaths we derive a master equation for the time evolution of the probability\n$P_t(L=\\ell)$, $\\ell=1,2,\\dots$, where $\\ell$ is the length of the shortest\ndirected path.

However, training a deep neural network is very\ntime-consuming, especially on big data. It has become difficult for a single\nmachine to train a large model over large datasets. A popular solution is to\ndistribute and parallelize the training process across multiple machines using\nthe parameter server framework. In this paper, we present a distributed\nparadigm on the parameter server framework called Dynamic Stale Synchronous\nParallel (DSSP) which improves the state-of-the-art Stale Synchronous Parallel\n(SSP) paradigm by dynamically determining the staleness threshold at the run\ntime. Conventionally to run distributed training in SSP, the user needs to\nspecify a particular staleness threshold as a hyper-parameter. However, a user\ndoes not usually know how to set the threshold and thus often finds a threshold\nvalue through trial and error, which is time-consuming. Based on workers'\nrecent processing time, our approach DSSP adaptively adjusts the threshold per\niteration at running time to reduce the waiting time of faster workers for\nsynchronization of the globally shared parameters, and consequently increases\nthe frequency of parameters updates (increases iteration throughput), which\nspeedups the convergence rate. We compare DSSP with other paradigms such as\nBulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP), Asynchronous Parallel (ASP), and SSP by\nrunning deep neural networks (DNN) models over GPU clusters in both homogeneous\nand heterogeneous environments. The results show that in a heterogeneous\nenvironment where the cluster consists of mixed models of GPUs, DSSP converges\nto a higher accuracy much earlier than SSP and BSP and performs similarly to\nASP. In a homogeneous distributed cluster, DSSP has more stable and slightly\nbetter performance than SSP and ASP, and converges much faster than BSP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 23:03:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

A machine learning interatomic\npotential (MLIP) recently emerged but often requires an extensive size of the\ntraining dataset, making it a less feasible approach. Here we demonstrate that\nan MLIP trained with a rationally designed small training dataset can predict\nthermal transport across GBs in graphene with ab initio accuracy at an\naffordable computational cost.
