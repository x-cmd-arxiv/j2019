Since the Equation of State governing the interior of neutron stars\nis only loosely constrained, there is even the possibility that strange quark\nmatter exists inside the core of neutron stars. We investigate how strange\nquark matter cores affect the binary neutron star coalescence by performing\nnumerical relativity simulations. Interestingly, the strong phase transition\ncan cause a reduction of the convergence order of the numerical schemes to\nfirst order if the numerical resolution is not high enough. Therefore, an\nadditional challenge is added in producing high-quality gravitational wave\ntemplates for Equation of States with a strong phase transition. Focusing on\none particular configuration of an equal mass configuration consistent with\nGW170817, we compute and discuss the associated gravitational wave signal and\nsome of the electromagnetic counterparts connected to the merger of the two\nstars. We find that existing waveform approximants employed for the analysis of\nGW170817 allow describing this kind of systems within the numerical\nuncertainties, which, however, are several times larger than for pure hadronic\nEquation of States, which means that even higher resolutions have been employed\nfor an accurate gravitational wave model comparison. We also show that for the\nchosen Equation of State, quasi-universal relations describing the\ngravitational wave emission after the moment of merger seem to hold and that\nthe electromagnetic signatures connected to our chosen setup would not be\nbright enough to explain the kilonova associated to GW170817.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 16:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-09"}

Most of\nthe studies on stance detection have focused on analysing user's posts on a\ngiven topic to predict the stance. However, the stance in social media can be\ninferred from a mixture of signals that might reflect user's beliefs including\nposts and online interactions. This paper examines various online features of\nusers to detect their stance towards different topics. We compare multiple set\nof features, including on-topic content, network interactions, user's\npreferences, and online network connections. Our objective is to understand the\nonline signals that can reveal the users' stance. Experimentation is applied on\ntweets dataset from the SemEval stance detection task, which covers five\ntopics. Results show that stance of a user can be detected with multiple\nsignals of user's online activity, including their posts on the topic, the\nnetwork they interact with or follow, the websites they visit, and the content\nthey like. The performance of the stance modelling using different network\nfeatures are comparable with the state-of-the-art reported model that used\ntextual content only. In addition, combining network and content features leads\nto the highest reported performance to date on the SemEval dataset with\nF-measure of 72.49%. We further present an extensive analysis to show how these\ndifferent set of features can reveal stance. Our findings have distinct privacy\nimplications, where they highlight that stance is strongly embedded in user's\nonline social network that, in principle, individuals can be profiled from\ntheir interactions and connections even when they do not post about the topic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 16:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-09"}

The high voltage supply was designed to be\nelectrically isolated from all other electronics (except for the PMT) to reduce\nnoise pickup.

However, these algorithms are faced with the\ntradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. The fast algorithms are generally\nless accurate, while the accurate dose engines are often time consuming. In\nthis work, we try to resolve this dilemma by exploring deep learning (DL) for\ndose calculation. Methods: We developed a new radiotherapy dose calculation\nengine based on a modified Hierarchically Densely Connected U-net (HD U-net)\nmodel and tested its feasibility with prostate intensity-modulated radiation\ntherapy (IMRT) cases. Mapping from an IMRT fluence map domain to a 3D dose\ndomain requires a deep neural network of complicated architecture and a huge\ntraining dataset. To solve this problem, we first project the fluence maps to\nthe dose domain using a modified ray-tracing algorithm, and then we use the HD\nU-net to map the ray-tracing dose distribution into an accurate dose\ndistribution calculated using a collapsed cone convolution/superposition (CS)\nalgorithm. Results: It takes about one second to compute a 3D dose distribution\nfor a typical 7-field prostate IMRT plan, which can be further reduced to\nachieve real-time dose calculation by optimizing the network. For all eight\ntesting patients, evaluation with Gamma Index and various clinical goals for\nIMRT optimization shows that the DL dose distributions are clinically identical\nto the CS dose distributions. Conclusions: We have shown the feasibility of\nusing DL for calculating radiotherapy dose distribution with high accuracy and\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 16:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

The second method, which is\nthe main contribution of this work, is a novel penalty formulation, which finds\ntargeted and untargeted universal adversarial perturbations. Differently from\nthe greedy approach, the penalty method minimizes an appropriate objective\nfunction on a batch of samples. Therefore, it produces more successful attacks\nwhen the number of training samples is limited.

The\nspin pumping stems from time-dependent fields introduced into the quantum\nHamiltonian of electrons by the classical dynamics of localized magnetic\nmoments (LMMs) comprising the domains. The pumped currents carry spin-polarized\nelectrons which, in turn, exert backaction on LMMs in the form of nonlocal\ndamping which is more than twice as large as conventional local Gilbert\ndamping.

Problems such as modularity, centrality, alignment, and clustering\nhave been formalized and solved in various application contexts. In this paper,\nwe focus on databases for applications in which graphs have a spatial basis,\nwhich we refer to as rigid graphs. Nodes in such graphs have preferred\npositions relative to their graph neighbors. Examples of such graphs include\nabstractions of large biomolecules, functional connectomes of the human brain,\nand mobile device/ sensor communication logs. When analyzing such networks it\nis important to consider edge lengths; e.g., when identifying conserved\npatterns through graph alignment, it is important for conserved edges to have\ncorrelated lengths, in addition to topological similarity. In contrast to a\nlarge body of work on topological graph alignment, rigid graph alignment\nsimultaneously aligns the network, as well as the underlying structure as\ncharacterized by edge lengths. We formulate the problem and present a\nmeta-algorithm based on expectation-maximization that alternately aligns the\nnetwork and the structure.

In particular, we study the linear scalar\nperturbations of theories with two interacting scalar fields as a proxy for a\ndark energy and matter fields, and explicitly show how canonical\ntransformations relate these three types of instabilities with each other. We\ngenerically show that low-energy ghosts are equivalent to tachyonic\ninstabilities, and that high-energy ghosts are equivalent to gradient\ninstabilities. Via examples we make evident the fact that whenever one of these\nfields exhibits an instability then the entire physical system becomes\nunstable, with an unbounded Hamiltonian. Finally, we discuss the role of\ninteractions between the two fields, and show that whereas most of the time\ninteractions will not determine whether an instability is present or not, they\nmay affect the timescale of the instability. We also find exceptional cases in\nwhich the two fields are ghosts and hence the physical system is seemingly\nunstable, but the presence of interactions actually lead to stable solutions.\nThese results are very important for assessing the viability of dark energy\nmodels that may exhibit ghost, gradient or tachyonic modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 17:49:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 15:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-30"}

Here, we show how to extend generic\nquantum-mechanical Hamiltonians to higher dimensions in such a way that\neigenstates of the original Hamiltonian are obtained as projections of the\nHamiltonian in superspace, which we call the super Hamiltonian. We apply the\nsuper Hamiltonian formalism to a simple, yet realistic one-dimensional quantum\nparticle in a quasiperiodic potential without the tight-binding approximation,\nand obtain continuously labelled eigenstates of the system corresponding to a\ncontinuous spectrum. All states corresponding to the continuum are\nquasiperiodic.

The closed form of this\none-dimensional Green's function is equally valid for any continuum state in\nany one-dimensional single-particle quantum system admitting continuous\nspectrum. With the basis set we use, which is periodic in superspace, and\ntherefore quasiperiodic in physical space, we find that Anderson-localised\nstates are also quasiperiodic if distributional solutions are admitted, but\ncircumvent this difficulty by generalising the superspace method to open\nboundary conditions (cont'd).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-12"}

The classical three-point\nfunctions can be computed directly from these functional equations, and the\nresult matches with the classical limit of the celebrated DOZZ formula.

The elongation of the molecular domains is believed to\nfacilitate the domain percolation, which causes higher charge mobility, hence\nthe higher short-circuit current density (Jsc). On the other hand, it was also\nobserved that the electronic properties of the P3HT-rich and PCBM-rich domains\nin the electric-field-assisted annealed samples showed smaller energy band gaps\nand smaller molecular orbital offset between the two domains, which is argued\nto decrease the open circuit voltage (Voc) and negatively impact the OPVC\nperformance.

Studies of the cosmic\ninfluence of supermassive black holes are limited by the current large\nuncertainties in the determination of black hole masses. One dominant\nlimitation is the unknown geometry, dynamics and line-of-sight inclination of\nthe broad line region, used to probe the central black hole mass. Recent\nprogress has been made to constrain the spatial and kinematic structure of the\nbroad line region using dynamical modelling of AGN monitoring data and an\nunderlying physical model for the broad line region. In this work we test the\nability of a modified version of this dynamical modelling code to constrain the\nbroad line region structure using single-epoch spectra. We test our modelling\ncode on single-epoch spectra of nearby Arp 151 by comparing our results with\nthose obtained with monitoring data of this same object. We find that a\nsignificant fraction of the broad line region parameters can indeed be\nadequately constrained, with uncertainties that are comparable to, or at most a\nfactor of ~ a few higher than those obtained from modelling of monitoring data.\nConsidering the wealth of available single-epoch spectroscopic observations,\nthis method is promising for establishing the overall AGN population trends in\nthe geometry and dynamics of the broad line region. This method can be applied\nto spectra of AGN at low and high redshift making it valuable for studies of\ncosmological black hole and AGN evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 18:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

Traditionally, priors about the image properties\nare taken into account to restrict the solution space. However, few techniques\nexploit the prior about the noise properties.

The\npermanent is #P-Complete; hence it is unlikely that a polynomial-time algorithm\nexists for the problem. Researchers have therefore focused on finding tractable\nsubclasses of matrices for permanent computation. One such subclass that has\nreceived much attention is that of sparse matrices i.e. matrices with few\nentries set to 1, the rest being 0. For this subclass, improved theoretical\nupper bounds and practically efficient algorithms have been developed. In this\npaper, we ask whether it is possible to go beyond sparse matrices in our quest\nfor developing scalable techniques for the permanent, and answer this question\naffirmatively. Our key insight is to represent permanent computation\nsymbolically using Algebraic Decision Diagrams (ADDs). ADD-based techniques\nnaturally use dynamic programming, and hence avoid redundant computation\nthrough memoization. This permits exploiting the hidden structure in a large\nclass of matrices that have so far remained beyond the reach of permanent\ncomputation techniques. The availability of sophisticated libraries\nimplementing ADDs also makes the task of engineering practical solutions\nrelatively straightforward. While a complete characterization of matrices\nadmitting a compact ADD representation remains open, we provide strong\nexperimental evidence of the effectiveness of our approach for computing the\npermanent, not just for sparse matrices, but also for dense matrices and for\nmatrices with \"similar\" rows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 20:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-12"}

This can be\nattributed, at least in part, to the high variance in estimating the gradient\nof the task objective with Monte Carlo methods. Previous research has\nendeavored to contend with this problem by studying control variates (CVs) that\ncan reduce the variance of estimates without introducing bias, including the\nearly use of baselines, state dependent CVs, and the more recent state-action\ndependent CVs. In this work, we analyze the properties and drawbacks of\nprevious CV techniques and, surprisingly, we find that these works have\noverlooked an important fact that Monte Carlo gradient estimates are generated\nby trajectories of states and actions.

Its abundance\nis usually assumed to be an interstellar ratio throughout the warm molecular\nlayer of the disk. But recent observations of low CO gas abundance in many\nprotoplanetary disks challenge our understanding of physical and chemical\nevolutions in disks. Here we investigate the CO abundance structures in four\nwell-studied disks and compare their structures with predictions of chemical\nprocessing of CO and transport of CO ice-coated dust grains in disks. We use\nspatially resolved CO isotopologue line observations and detailed\nthermo-chemical models to derive CO abundance structures. We find that the CO\nabundance varies with radius by an order of magnitude in these disks. We show\nthat although chemical processes can efficiently reduce the total column of CO\ngas within 1 Myr under an ISM level of cosmic-ray ionization rate, the\ndepletion mostly occurs at the deep region of a disk. Without sufficient\nvertical mixing, the surface layer is not depleted enough to reproduce weak CO\nemissions observed. The radial profiles of CO depletion in three disks are\nqualitatively consistent with predictions of pebble formation, settling, and\ndrifting in disks. But the dust evolution alone cannot fully explain the high\ndepletion observed in some disks. These results suggest that dust evolution may\nplay a significant role in transporting volatile materials and a coupled\nchemical-dynamical study is necessary to understand what raw materials are\navailable for planet formation at different distances from the central star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 21:08:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

However, some collaborative robots sacrifice\nprecision for safety, particular for high motion speed. The performance\ndegradation is caused by the inability of the joint servo controller to address\nthe uncertain nonlinear dynamics of the robot arm, e.g., due to joint\nflexibility. We consider two approaches to improve the trajectory tracking\nperformance through feedforward compensation. The first approach uses iterative\nlearning control, with the gradient-based iterative update generated from the\nrobot forward dynamics model. The second approach uses dynamic inversion to\ndirectly compensate for the robot forward dynamics. If the forward dynamics is\nstrictly proper or is non-minimum-phase (e.g., due to time delays), its stable\ninverse would be non-causal. Both approaches require robot dynamical models.\nThis paper presents results of using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to\napproximate these dynamical models-forward dynamics in the first case, inverse\ndynamics (possibly non-causal) in the second case. We use the bi-directional\nRNN to capture the noncausality. The RNNs are trained based on a collection of\ncommanded trajectories and the actual robot responses. We use a Baxter robot to\nevaluate the two approaches. The Baxter robot exhibits significant joint\nflexibility due to the series-elastic joint actuators. Both approaches achieve\nsizable improvement over the uncompensated robot motion, for both random joint\ntrajectories and Cartesian motion. The inverse dynamics method is particularly\nattractive as it may be used to more accurately track a user input as in\nteleoperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 21:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-12"}

In particular, we consider cases\nwhere back-reaction slows, but fails to halt, the collapse of the wormhole\ninterior, so that the wormhole is traversable only at sufficiently early times.\nFor non-extremal backgrounds, we find the integrated null energy along the\nhorizon of the classical background to be exponentially small, and thus\ntraversability to be exponentially fragile.

For this purpose, several multimodal fusion strategies have been\nproposed, ranging from relatively simple operations (e.g., linear sum) to more\ncomplex ones (e.g., Block). The resulting multimodal representations define an\nintermediate feature space for capturing the interplay between visual and\nsemantic features, that is helpful in selectively focusing on image content. In\nthis paper, we propose a question-agnostic attention mechanism that is\ncomplementary to the existing question-dependent attention mechanisms. Our\nproposed model parses object instances to obtain an `object map' and applies\nthis map on the visual features to generate Question-Agnostic Attention (QAA)\nfeatures. In contrast to question-dependent attention approaches that are\nlearned end-to-end, the proposed QAA does not involve question-specific\ntraining, and can be easily included in almost any existing VQA model as a\ngeneric light-weight pre-processing step, thereby adding minimal computation\noverhead for training. Further, when used in complement with the\nquestion-dependent attention, the QAA allows the model to focus on the regions\ncontaining objects that might have been overlooked by the learned attention\nrepresentation. Through extensive evaluation on VQAv1, VQAv2 and TDIUC\ndatasets, we show that incorporating complementary QAA allows state-of-the-art\nVQA models to perform better, and provides significant boost to simplistic VQA\nmodels, enabling them to performance on par with highly sophisticated fusion\nstrategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 03:03:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2020 03:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

Typical devices include\nhigh-frequency transducers, which makes tomography techniques based on\nnumerical wave propagation simulations computationally challenging, especially\nin 3D. Therefore, despite the finite-frequency nature of ultrasonic waves,\nray-theoretical approaches to transmission tomography are still widely used.\n  This work introduces finite-frequency traveltime tomography to medical\nultrasound. In addition to being computationally tractable for 3D imaging at\nhigh frequencies, the method has two main advantages: (1) It correctly accounts\nfor the frequency dependence and volumetric sensitivity of traveltime\nmeasurements, which are related to off-ray-path scattering and diffraction. (2)\nIt naturally enables out-of-plane imaging and the construction of 3D images\nfrom 2D slice-by-slice acquisition systems.\n  Our method rests on the availability of calibration data in water, used to\nlinearize the forward problem and to provide analytical expressions of\ncross-correlation traveltime sensitivity. As a consequence of the finite\nfrequency content, sensitivity is distributed in multiple Fresnel volumes,\nthereby providing out-of-plane sensitivity. To improve computational\nefficiency, we develop a memory-efficient implementation by encoding the\nJacobian operator with a 1D parameterization, which allows us to extend the\nmethod to large-scale domains.

Major systemic-and procedural-based issues have subsequently been\nidentified in both clinical trials and preclinical animal model\nexperimentation. As well, issues related to the neuroprotective moiety itself\nhave contributed to clinical trial failures, including late delivery,\nmono-targeting, low potency and poor tolerability. Conditioning (pre-or post-)\nstrategies can potentially address these issues and are therefore gaining\nincreasing attention as approaches to protect the brain from cerebral ischemia.\nIn principle, conditioning can address concerns of timing (preconditioning\ncould be pre-emptively applied in high-risk patients, and post-conditioning\nafter patients experience an unannounced brain infarction) and signaling\n(multi-modal). However, acute neuroprotection and conditioning strategies face\na common translational issue: a myriad of possibilities exist, but with no\nstrategy to select optimal candidates. In this review, we argue that what is\nrequired is a neuroprotective framework to identify the \"best\" agent(s), at the\nearliest investigational stage possible.

An\nappropriately designed in vitro (neuron culture, brain slices) approach, based\non increasing the harshness of the ischemic-like insult, can be useful in\nidentifying the \"best\" conditioner or acute neuroprotective therapy, as well as\nhow the two modalities can be combined to overcome individual limitations. This\nwould serve as a base from which to launch further investigation into therapies\nrequired to protect the neurovascular unit in in vivo animal models of cerebral\nischemia.

This limits the applicability of preconditioning in clinical\nsituations, which arise unpredictably, such as myocardial infarction and\nstroke. There are, however, clinical situations that arise as a result of\nischemia-reperfusion injury, which can be anticipated, and are therefore\nadequate candidates for preconditioning. Organ and more particularly kidney\ntransplantation, the optimal treatment for suitable patients with end stage\nrenal disease (ESRD), is a predictable surgery that permits the use of\npreconditioning protocols to prepare the organ for subsequent\nischemic/reperfusion stress. It therefore seems crucial to develop appropriate\npreconditioning protocols against ischemia that will occur under\ntransplantation conditions, which up to now mainly referred to mechanical\nischemic preconditioning that triggers innate responses. It is not known if\npreconditioning has to be applied to the donor, the recipient, or both. No\ndrug/target pair has been envisioned and validated in the clinic. Options for\nidentifying new target/drug pairs involve the use of model animals, such as\ndrosophila, in which some physiological pathways, such as the management of\noxygen, are highly conserved across evolution. Oxygen is the universal element\nof life existence on earth. In this review we focus on a very specific pathway\nof pharmacological preconditioning identified in drosophila that was\nsuccessfully transferred to mammalian models that has potential application in\nhuman health. Very few mechanisms identified in these model animals have been\ntranslated to an upper evolutionary level. This review highlights the\ncommonality between oxygen regulation between diverse animals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 07:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-12"}

Identifying the\nnature of the coupling can be an important step in designing the setup for a\nspecific application. In order to unambiguously distinguish between different\noptomechanical couplings, we develop a general framework based on the\nHamiltonian of the system. Using this framework we give examples of different\ncouplings, and discuss in details one particular case of a purely coherent\ncoupling in a ring cavity with a movable mirror inside. We demonstrate that in\ncertain cases coherent coupling can be beneficial for cooling the motion of the\nmechanical oscillator. Our general framework allows to approach the design of\noptomechanical experiments in a methodological way, for precise exploitation of\nthe strengths of particular optomechanical couplings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 09:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

The most critical issue of any eTSC method is to decide when enough\ndata of a time series has been seen to take a decision: Waiting for more data\npoints usually makes the classification problem easier but delays the time in\nwhich a classification is made; in contrast, earlier classification has to cope\nwith less input data, often leading to inferior accuracy. The state-of-the-art\neTSC methods compute a fixed optimal decision time assuming that every times\nseries has the same defined start time (like turning on a machine). However, in\nmany real-life applications measurements start at arbitrary times (like\nmeasuring heartbeats of a patient), implying that the best time for taking a\ndecision varies heavily between time series. We present TEASER, a novel\nalgorithm that models eTSC as a two two-tier classification problem: In the\nfirst tier, a classifier periodically assesses the incoming time series to\ncompute class probabilities. However, these class probabilities are only used\nas output label if a second-tier classifier decides that the predicted label is\nreliable enough, which can happen after a different number of measurements.

The\nsecurity definitions used so far in the literature are asymptotic, game-based,\nand not known to be composable. We show how to define finite, composable,\ncomputational security for secure quantum message transmission. The new\ndefinitions do not involve any games or oracles, they are directly operational:\na scheme is secure if it transforms an insecure channel and a shared key into\nan ideal secure channel from Alice to Bob, i.e., one which only allows Eve to\nblock messages and learn their size, but not change them or read them. By\nmodifying the ideal channel to provide Eve with more or less capabilities, one\ngets an array of different security notions. By design these transformations\nare composable, resulting in composable security.\n  Crucially, the new definitions are finite. Security does not rely on the\nasymptotic hardness of a computational problem. Instead, one proves a finite\nreduction: if an adversary can distinguish the constructed (real) channel from\nthe ideal one (for some fixed security parameters), then she can solve a finite\ninstance of some computational problem. Such a finite statement is needed to\nmake security claims about concrete implementations.\n  We then prove that (slightly modified versions of) protocols proposed in the\nliterature satisfy these composable definitions. And finally, we study the\nrelations between some game-based definitions and our composable ones. In\nparticular, we look at notions of quantum authenticated encryption and QCCA2,\nand show that they suffer from the same issues as their classical counterparts:\nthey exclude certain protocols which are arguably secure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 12:37:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 2019 14:27:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-24"}

Historically, probabilistic modeling has\nbeen constrained to (i) very restricted model classes where exact or\napproximate probabilistic inference were feasible, and (ii) small or\nmedium-sized data sets which fit within the main memory of the computer.\nHowever, developments in variational inference, a general form of approximate\nprobabilistic inference originated in statistical physics, are allowing\nprobabilistic modeling to overcome these restrictions: (i) Approximate\nprobabilistic inference is now possible over a broad class of probabilistic\nmodels containing a large number of parameters, and (ii) scalable inference\nmethods based on stochastic gradient descent and distributed computation\nengines allow to apply probabilistic modeling over massive data sets.

The\nresolution of PPMAP images is sufficient (31 pc on M31) that we can analyse\nfar-IR dust emission on the scale of Giant Molecular Clouds. By comparing PPMAP\nestimates of the far-IR emission optical depth at 300 microns (tau_300), and\nthe near-IR extinction optical depth at 1.1 microns (tau_1.1) obtained from the\nreddening of RGB stars, we show that the ratio R_OBS.tau = tau_1.1/tau_300\nfalls in the range 500 to 1500.

Having found no evidence for an\nelectron recoil signal induced by mirror dark matter interactions we place an\nupper limit on the kinetic mixing parameter over a range of local mirror\nelectron temperatures between 0.1 and 0.6 keV. This limit shows significant\nimprovement over the previous experimental constraint from orthopositronium\ndecays and significantly reduces the allowed parameter space for the model. We\nexclude mirror electron temperatures above 0.3 keV at a 90% confidence level,\nfor this model, and constrain the kinetic mixing below this temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 14:43:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 2019 10:05:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Here, we\nsimulate the evolution of atmospheric escape of close-in giant planets and\ncalculate their associated Ly-alpha and H-alpha transits. We use a\none-dimensional hydrodynamic escape model to compute physical properties of the\natmosphere and a ray-tracing technique to simulate spectroscopic transits. We\nconsider giant (0.3 and 1M_jup) planets orbiting a solar-like star at 0.045au,\nevolving from 10 to 5000 Myr. We find that younger giants show higher rates of\nescape, owing to a favourable combination of higher irradiation fluxes and\nweaker gravities. Less massive planets show higher escape rates (1e10 -- 1e13\ng/s) than those more massive (1e9 -- 1e12 g/s) over their evolution. We\nestimate that the 1-M_jup planet would lose at most 1% of its initial mass due\nto escape, while the 0.3-M_jup planet, could lose up to 20%. This supports the\nidea that the Neptunian desert has been formed due to significant mass loss in\nlow-gravity planets. At younger ages, we find that the mid-transit Ly-alpha\nline is saturated at line centre, while H-alpha exhibits transit depths of at\nmost 3 -- 4% in excess of their geometric transit. While at older ages,\nLy-alpha absorption is still significant (and possibly saturated for the lower\nmass planet), the H-alpha absorption nearly disappears.

The solvability of the\nSchrodinger equation of these problems by the variables separation method is\ngiven in a double, spherical and parabolic coordinates. The quadratic Hahn\nalgebra QH(3) as a hidden symmetry remains unchanged with different\ndecomposition of the original real space ${\\rm I \\!R}^{N}$ into components in\nthe framework of addition rule for SU(1,1) algebra. Also the hidden symmetry\nalgebra as Higgs/Hahn algebras is clearly shown by the commutant approach in\nthe sense of Howe duality. A dimensional reduction is carried out to a singular\noscillator of two dimensions where every variable is the n-dimensional\nhyper-radius r. The dual connection with (N=2n)-dimensional singular oscillator\nand the (n+1) general MICZ-Kepler system in the class of quasi-exact (QE)\nproblems also are considered. The certain generalization both of harmonic\noscillator model by anisotropic and nonlinear inharmonic terms and its dual\nanalog is shown and analyzed in the framework of generalized KS\ntransformations. The exact analytical solutions of the Schrodinger equation for\nabovementioned problems for QE class are discused and given for four series of\ndual quasi-exact solvable models. In particular, a comparison with similar\nresults in lower dimensions and its generalization are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 13:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

To estimate the model, we propose\nto maximise a criterion specific to the Supervised Component-based Generalised\nLinear Regression (SCGLR) within an adaptation of Schall's algorithm. This\nextension of SCGLR is tested on both simulated and real data, and compared to\nRidge- and Lasso-based regularisations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 06:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-22"}

In this paper, we propose a novel\nend-to-end Neural Image Compression and Explanation (NICE) framework that\nlearns to (1) explain the predictions of convolutional neural networks (CNNs),\nand (2) subsequently compress the input images for efficient storage or\ntransmission. Specifically, NICE generates a sparse mask over an input image by\nattaching a stochastic binary gate to each pixel of the image, whose parameters\nare learned through the interaction with the CNN classifier to be explained.\nThe generated mask is able to capture the saliency of each pixel measured by\nits influence to the final prediction of CNN; it can also be used to produce a\nmixed-resolution image, where important pixels maintain their original high\nresolution and insignificant background pixels are subsampled to a low\nresolution. The produced images achieve a high compression rate (e.g., about\n0.6x of original image file size), while retaining a similar classification\naccuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks\ndemonstrate the superior performance of NICE compared to the state-of-the-art\nmethods in terms of explanation quality and semantic image compression rate.\nOur code is available at: https://github.com/lxuniverse/NICE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 15:39:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 03:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

Witnessing advances in deep learning, significant work has been\nobserved in face recognition, which touched upon various parts of the\nrecognition framework like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Layers, Loss\nfunctions, etc. Various loss functions such as Cross-Entropy, Angular-Softmax\nand ArcFace have been introduced to learn the weights of network for face\nrecognition. However, these loss functions do not give high priority to the\nhard samples as compared to the easy samples. Moreover, their learning process\nis biased due to a number of easy examples compared to hard examples. In this\npaper, we address this issue by considering hard examples with more priority.\nIn order to do so, We propose a Hard-Mining loss by increasing the loss for\nharder examples and decreasing the loss for easy examples. The proposed concept\nis generic and can be used with any existing loss function. We test the\nHard-Mining loss with different losses such as Cross-Entropy, Angular-Softmax\nand ArcFace. The proposed Hard-Mining loss is tested over widely used Labeled\nFaces in the Wild (LFW) and YouTube Faces (YTF) datasets. The training is\nperformed over CASIA-WebFace and MS-Celeb-1M datasets. We use the residual\nnetwork (i.e., ResNet18) for the experimental analysis. The experimental\nresults suggest that the performance of existing loss functions is boosted when\nused in the framework of the proposed Hard-Mining loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2019 06:55:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 00:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-24"}

A\nstraightforward way to eliminate anisotropic resolution is to fuse images\nrecorded from multiple viewing directions achieved mostly by the mechanical\nrotation of the entire sample. In the presented approach, multiview imaging of\nsingle cells is implemented by rotating them around an axis perpendicular to\nthe optical axis by means of holographic optical tweezers. For this, the cells\nare indirectly trapped and manipulated with special microtools made with\ntwo-photon polymerization. The cell is firmly attached to the microtool and is\nprecisely manipulated with 6 degrees of freedom. The total control over the\ncells position allows for its multiview fluorescence imaging from arbitrarily\nselected directions. The image stacks obtained this way are combined into one\n3D image array with a special image processing algorithm resulting in isotropic\noptical resolution.
