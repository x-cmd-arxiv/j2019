LiDARs (Light Detection And Ranging) with mechanical,\nfixed, sampling templates are commonly used in today's autonomous vehicles. An\nemerging technology, based on solid-state depth sensors, with no mechanical\nparts, allows fast, adaptive, programmable scans.\n  In this paper, we investigate the topic of adaptive, image-driven, sampling\nand reconstruction strategies. First, we formulate a piece-wise linear depth\nmodel with several tolerance parameters and estimate its validity for indoor\nand outdoor scenes. Our model and experiments predict that, in the optimal\ncase, about 20-60 piece-wise linear structures can approximate well a depth\nmap. This translates to a depth-to-image sampling ratio of about 1/1200. We\npropose a simple, generic, sampling and reconstruction algorithm, based on\nsuper-pixels.

Spins generated in these\nmaterials have successfully switched magnets with in-plane magnetic anisotropy\n(IMA) and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) through spin orbit torque\n(SOT) mechanism. It is generally accepted that PMA magnets are preferred over\nIMA magnets in data storage applications owing to their large thermal stability\neven at ultra scaled dimensions. However, SOT switching of PMA magnets by\nconventional GSHE materials requires either a small external magnetic field, a\nlocal dipolar field, or introducing tilted anisotropy to break the symmetry\nwith respect to the magnetization. To deterministically switch a PMA without\nany additional assistance, nonconventional GSHE materials that can generate\nspins with polarization perpendicular to the surfaces are needed.

In this paper, we examine\nthe performance challenges of a linear-algebra-based approach to building graph\nframeworks and describe new design principles for overcoming these bottlenecks.\nAmong the new design principles is exploiting input sparsity, which allows\nusers to write graph algorithms without specifying push and pull direction.\nExploiting output sparsity allows users to tell the backend which values of the\noutput in a single vectorized computation they do not want computed.\nLoad-balancing is an important feature for balancing work amongst parallel\nworkers.

Numerically, these cases\ncan be studied efficiently by means of Large Eddy Simulations, in which the\ncomputational resources are used to evolve the system only up to a finite grid\nsize. The resolution is not fine enough to capture all the relevant small-scale\nphysics at play, which is instead effectively modeled by a set of additional\nterms in the evolution equations, dubbed as sub-grid-scale model. Here we\nextend such approach, commonly used in\nnon-relativistic/non-magnetic/incompressible fluid dynamics, applying the\nso-called gradient model to a general set of balance-law equations, that\nincludes the relevant case in which a non-trivial inversion of conserved to\nprimitive fields is needed. In particular, we focus on the relativistic\ncompressible ideal MHD scenario, providing for the first time (and for any\nequation of state) all the additional sub-grid-scale terms. As an application,\nwe consider box simulations of the relativistic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability,\nwhich is also the first mechanism responsible for the magnetic field\namplification in binary neutron star mergers and cannot yet be fully captured\nby the finest-grid and longest simulations available. The performance of our\nmodel is numerically assessed by comparing it to the residuals arising from the\nfiltering of high-resolution simulations. We find that the model can fit very\nwell those residuals from resolutions a few times higher. Although the\napplication shown here explicitly considers the Minkowski metric, it can be\ndirectly extended to general relativity, thus settling the basis to implement\nthe gradient sub-grid model in a GRMHD binary merger.

However, due to the high nonlinearity and nonconvexity of the\ninvolved curvature term, conventional algorithms suffer from slow convergence\nand high computational cost. Various fast algorithms have been proposed, among\nwhich, the augmented Lagrangian based ones are very popular in the community.\nHowever, parameter tuning might be very challenging for these methods. In this\npaper, a simple cutting-off strategy is introduced into the augmented\nLagrangian based algorithms for minimizing the Euler's elastica energy, which\nleads to easy parameter tuning and fast convergence. The cutting-off strategy\nis based on an observation of inconsistency inside the augmented Lagrangian\nbased algorithms. When the weighting parameter of the curvature term goes to\nzero, the energy functional boils down to the ROF model. So, a natural\nrequirement is that its augmented Lagrangian based algorithms should also\napproach the augmented Lagrangian based algorithms formulated directly for\nsolving the ROF model from the very beginning. Unfortunately, this is not the\ncase for certain existing augmented Lagrangian based algorithms. The proposed\ncutting-off strategy helps to decouple the tricky dependence between the\nauxiliary splitting variables, so as to remove the observed inconsistency.\nNumerical experiments suggest that the proposed algorithm enjoys easier\nparameter-tuning, faster convergence and even higher quality of image\nrestorations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 00:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}

Combining cosmological\nhydrodynamic simulations and radiative transfer calculations, we present\ntheoretical predictions of multi-wavelength radiative properties of the first\ngalaxies at z=6-15. We find that most of the gas and dust are ejected from\nstar-forming regions due to supernova (SN) feedback, which allows UV photons to\nescape. We show that the peak of SED rapidly shifts between UV and infrared\nwavelengths on a timescale of 100 Myr due to intermittent star formation and\nfeedback. When dusty gas covers the star-forming regions, the galaxies become\nbright in the observed-frame sub-millimeter wavelengths.

TopoTag uses topological and\ngeometrical information in marker detection to achieve higher robustness.\nTopological information is extensively used for 2D marker detection, and\nfurther corresponding geometrical information for ID decoding. Robust 3D pose\nestimation is achieved by taking advantage of all TopoTag vertices.

These three modalities can be accessed using a crystal\nanalyser, a grating interferometer or by looking at a directly-resolved grid,\ngrating or speckle pattern. Grating and grid-based methods extract a\ndifferential phase signal by measuring how far a feature in the illumination\nhas been shifted transversely due to the presence of a sample. The dark-field\nsignal is extracted by measuring how the visibility of the structured\nillumination is decreased, typically due to the presence of sub-pixel\nstructures in a sample.

They are often trained with episodic\ntraining where they iteratively train a common metric space that reduces\ndistance between the class representatives and instances belonging to each\nclass, over large number of episodes with random classes. However, this\ntraining is limited in that while the main target is the generalization to the\nclassification of unseen classes during training, there is no explicit\nconsideration of generalization during meta-training phase. To tackle this\nissue, we propose a simple yet effective meta-learning framework for\nmetricbased approaches, which we refer to as learning to generalize (L2G), that\nexplicitly constrains the learning on a sampled classification task to reduce\nthe classification error on a randomly sampled unseen classification task with\na bilevel optimization scheme.

Two technologies of interest are Posit and RISC-V. Posit was\nintroduced in mid-2017 as a viable alternative to IEEE 754-2008. Posit promises\nmore accuracy, higher dynamic range, and fewer unused states along with simpler\nhardware designs as compared to IEEE 754-2008. RISC-V, on the other hand,\nprovides a commercial-grade open-source ISA. It is not only elegant and simple\nbut also highly extensible and customizable, thereby facilitating novel\nmicro-architectural research and exploration. In this paper, we bring these two\ntechnologies together and propose the first Posit Enabled RISC-V core. The\npaper provides insights on how the current 'F' extension and the custom op-code\nspace of RISC-V can be leveraged/modified to support Posit arithmetic. We also\npresent implementation details of a parameterized and feature-complete Posit\nFPU which is integrated with the RISC-V compliant SHAKTI C-class core either as\nan execution unit or as an accelerator. To fully leverage the potential of\nPosit, we further enhance our Posit FPU, with minimal overheads, to support two\ndifferent exponent sizes (with posit-size being 32-bits). This allows\napplications to switch from high-accuracy computation mode to a mode with\nhigher dynamic-range at run-time. In the absence of viable software tool-chain\nto enable porting of applications in the Posit domain, we present a workaround\non how certain applications can be modified minimally to exploit the existing\nRISC-V tool-chain. We also provide examples of applications which can perform\nbetter with Posit as compared to IEEE 754-2008. The proposed Posit FPU consumes\n3507 slice LUTs and 1294 slice registers on an Artix-7-100T Xilinx FPGA while\ncapable of operating at 100 MHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 04:49:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}

Due to the hand-crafted\nnature of the ISP components, traditional ISP pipeline has limited\nreconstruction quality under challenging scenes. Recently, the convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated their competitiveness in solving many\nindividual image processing problems, such as image denoising, demosaicking,\nwhite balance and contrast enhancement. However, it remains a question whether\na CNN model can address the multiple tasks inside an ISP pipeline\nsimultaneously. We make a good attempt along this line and propose a novel\nframework, which we call CameraNet, for effective and general ISP pipeline\nlearning. The CameraNet is composed of two CNN modules to account for two sets\nof relatively uncorrelated subtasks in an ISP pipeline: restoration and\nenhancement. To train the two-stage CameraNet model, we specify two\ngroundtruths that can be easily created in the common workflow of photography.\nCameraNet is trained to progressively address the restoration and the\nenhancement subtasks with its two modules.

Existing approaches fail to explicitly model the mental\nimagery function of the agent, while the mental imagery is crucial to embodied\ncognition, and has a close relation to many high-level meta-skills such as\ngeneralization and interpretation. In this paper, we propose a novel Mental\nImagery eNhanceD (MIND) module for the embodied agent, as well as a relevant\ndeep reinforcement framework for training. The MIND module can not only model\nthe dynamics of the environment (e.g. 'what might happen if the agent passes\nthrough a door') but also help the agent to create a better understanding of\nthe environment (e.g. 'The refrigerator is usually in the kitchen'). Such\nknowledge makes the agent a faster and better learner in locating a feasible\npolicy with only a few trails. Furthermore, the MIND module can generate mental\nimages that are treated as short-term subgoals by our proposed deep\nreinforcement framework. These mental images facilitate policy learning since\nshort-term subgoals are easy to achieve and reusable. This yields better\nplanning efficiency than other algorithms that learn a policy directly from\nprimitive actions. Finally, the mental images visualize the agent's intentions\nin a way that human can understand, and this endows our agent's actions with\nmore interpretability. The experimental results and further analysis prove that\nthe agent with the MIND module is superior to its counterparts not only in EQA\nperformance but in many other aspects such as route planning, behavioral\ninterpretation, and the ability to generalize from a few examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 06:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}

Moreover, no phase transition toward delocalization is\nexpected in 1D. This behavior is strongly modified in the presence of a bias\nforce. We experimentally study this case, launching a non-interacting 39 K\nBose-Einstein condensate in a 1D disordered potential induced by a\nfar-off-resonance laser speckle, while controlling a bias force. In agreement\nwith theoretical predictions, we observe a transition between algebraic\nlocalization and delocalization as a function of our control parameter that is\nthe relative strength of the disorder against the bias force. We also\ndemonstrate that the initial velocity of the wave-packet only plays a role\nthrough an effective disorder strength due to the correlation of the disorder.\nAdding a bias force is a quite natural way to probe the transport properties of\nquantum systems, a subject of broad interest that can be in particular\naddressed with atomic quantum gases thanks to their high degree of control and\nversatility [1]. For example, Bloch oscillations has been measured through the\naddition of a constant force to atoms in periodic potential induced by an\noptical lattice [2]. A force applied to a harmonic trap is equivalent to a trap\ndisplacement. The response to such a displacement permits to reveal the fluid\nor insulating behavior of atomic systems. In 1D interacting Bose gases, the\npinning transition by an optical lattice [3] or the insulating transition in\nquasi-disordered optical lattice [4, 5] have been studied in this manner. More\nrecently, transport in quantum gases is also studied in junction-type setup\nmore analogous to condensed-matter systems: two reservoirs with different\nchemical potentials are connected through a constriction. For example, in a gas\nof fermions, the quantization of conductance through a quantum point contact\n[6] and the superfluid to normal transition in a disordered thin film have been\nobserved [7]. In our work, we focus on the transport of non-interacting\nparticles in disordered media. Without a bias force, quantum interferences\nbetween multiple paths lead to Anderson localization [8] whose signature is an\nexponential decay in space of single particle wave-function [9]. This\nphenomenon is ubiquitous in wave/quantum physics and it has been observed in\nmany physical contexts [10] including condensed-matter [11] and ultra-cold\natoms [12-14]. One-dimensional truly disordered systems are always localized\n[15], contrary to the 3D case where a phase transition between localized and\nextended single particle wave-functions takes place as a function of the\ndisorder strength [16-18]. The localization properties of 1D disordered systems\nare modified in the presence of a bias force. Theoretical studies predict a\ntransition from algebraic localization to delocalization as a function of a\nsingle control non-dimensional parameter $\\alpha$ which is the ratio of the\nforce to the disorder strength [19, 20]. Physically, $\\alpha$ is the relative\nenergy gain $\\Delta$E/E of a particle of energy E when moving over a\nlocalization length. Interestingly, in a 1D white noise disorder, this quantity\nis independent of E as the localization length is proportional to E. If\n$\\alpha$ is small, the force does not considerably change the localization\nbehavior of the particle while for large $\\alpha$ its dynamics is severely\naffected leading to delocalization. This localization-delocalization transition\nis predicted in the infinite time limit for white noise disorder [20]. In a\ncorrelated disorder, as the one produced from a far-off-resonance laser speckle\n[21], the situation is more complicated. Speckles have no Fourier component\nbeyond a spatial frequency 2k c. As a consequence, back-scattering and\nlocalization are not expected in the framework of Born approximation for atoms\nwith wavevectors k > k c [12, 22]. Since localized wave-functions always have a\nsmall fraction at long distance corresponding to large energies and momenta in\nthe presence of a bias force, we thus expect correlation-induced delocalization\nat infinite time. However, signatures of the algebraic\nlocalization-delocalization transition are predicted to be observable at\ntransient times [20]. In this paper, we report on the observation of the\nalgebraic localization-delocalization transition with cold-atoms propagating in\na one dimensional disordered potential in the presence of a controlled bias\nforce. We experimentally show that the non-dimensional parameter $\\alpha$ is\nthe only relevant parameter to describe the transition. We notice that the\ninitial velocity of the quantum wave packet only plays a role through the\ncorrelation of the disordered potential, showing that the transition is\nin-trinsically energy independent. In the localized regime, we demonstrate an\nalgebraic decay of the density and measure the corresponding decay exponent as\na function of $\\alpha$.

By extending the localization paradigm to completely general\ninterpolation inequalities, we reduce the study of various analytic and\ngeometric inequalities on $\\mathsf{QCD}$ spaces to the one-dimensional case.\nConsequently, we deduce that while (strictly) sub-Riemannian manifolds do not\nsatisfy any type of $\\mathsf{CD}$ condition, many of them satisfy numerous\nfunctional inequalities with \\emph{exactly the same} quantitative dependence\n(up to a factor of $Q$) as their $\\mathsf{CD}$ counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 08:24:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2019 21:33:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 18 Aug 2019 15:43:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 2019 12:43:51 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 11:32:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-17"}

The ESA Science's Voyage 2050 missions promise\ninsights into the big existential questions of our era: the prevalence of life\nin the Universe; the nature of space and time; and the intertwined nature of\nmatter, energy and gravity. It is likely that innovations in the acquisition,\nhandling and processing of vast data sets will drive these themes to scientific\nmaturity in the next decades. They offer us a timely opportunity to underline\nthe relevance of space sciences to everyday life and thinking. More generally,\nspace science is maturing to the point where it contributes to every major\naspect of our cultural discourse. Citizens need information, resources and\nopportunities to actively participate in that discourse, and ESA Science can\nprovide these. This white paper is a modest attempt to support ESA Science\nimprove its engagement with society. It focuses on issues and topics to improve\nESA Science's Education and Public Engagement activities. It does not dwell on\nthe topics that ESA already excels at; hence this White Paper provides a\ncritical review of what should and could be improved. We believe ESA's Voyage\n2050 programme teams have a responsibility to represent Europe's social and\ncultural diversity, and our suggestions are conceived in that spirit: to\nsupport ESA Science's complex task of engaging a hugely diverse audience in the\ncomplex issues of planning, building and operating fascinating space missions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 10:21:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}

However, state-of-the-art adversarial\nexamples typically have to be fed into the ASR system directly, and are not\nsuccessful when played in a room. The few published over-the-air adversarial\nexamples fall into one of three categories: they are either handcrafted\nexamples, they are so conspicuous that human listeners can easily recognize the\ntarget transcription once they are alerted to its content, or they require\nprecise information about the room where the attack takes place, and are hence\nnot transferable to other rooms. In this paper, we demonstrate the first\nalgorithm that produces generic adversarial examples, which remain robust in an\nover-the-air attack that is not adapted to the specific environment. Hence, no\nprior knowledge of the room characteristics is required. Instead, we use room\nimpulse responses (RIRs) to compute robust adversarial examples for arbitrary\nroom characteristics and employ the ASR system Kaldi to demonstrate the attack.\nFurther, our algorithm can utilize psychoacoustic methods to hide changes of\nthe original audio signal below the human thresholds of hearing. In practical\nexperiments, we show that the adversarial examples work for varying room\nsetups, and that no direct line-of-sight between speaker and microphone is\nnecessary. As a result, an attacker can create inconspicuous adversarial\nexamples for any target transcription and apply these to arbitrary room setups\nwithout any prior knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 10:29:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 2019 09:17:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 07:35:37 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 09:24:15 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 16:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

We find that with a larger\nsample, 1) the distributions of the characteristic properties of the shallow\ndecay phase (e.g. $t_{b}$ , $S_{X}$, $\\Gamma_{X,1}$, and $\\alpha_{X,1}$) still\naccords with normal or lognormal distribution; 2) $\\Gamma_{X,1}$ and\n$\\Gamma_{\\gamma}$ still show no correlation, but the tentative correlations of\ndurations, energy fluences, and isotropic energies between the gamma-ray and\nX-ray phases still exist; 3) for most GRBs, there is no significant spectral\nevolution between the shallow decay segment and its follow-up segment, and the\nlatter is usually consistent with the external-shock models; 4) assuming that\nthe central engine has a power-law luminosity release history as\n$L(t)=L_{0}(\\frac{t}{t_{0}})^{-q}$, we find that the value $q$ is mainly\ndistributed between -0.5 and 0.5, with an average value of 0.16$\\pm$ 0.12; 5)\nthe tentative correlation between $E_{\\rm{iso},X}$ and $t'_{b}$ disappears, so\nthat the global 3-parameter correlation ($E_{\\rm{iso},X}-E'_{p}-t'_{b}$)\nbecomes less significant; 6) the anti-correlation between $L_{X}$ and $t'_{b}$\nand the three-parameter correlation ($E_{\\rm{iso},\\gamma}-L_{X}-t_{b}$) indeed\nexist with a high confidence level. Overall, our results are generally\nconsistent with \\cite{liang07}, confirming their suggestion that the shallow\ndecay segment in most bursts is consistent with an external forward shock\norigin, probably due to a continuous energy injection from a long-lived central\nengine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 11:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-02"}

The color centers feature excellent optical properties,\ncomparable to silicon-vacancy centers in bulk diamond, resulting in a\nresolvable fine structure splitting, a linewidth close to the Fourier-Transform\nlimit under resonant excitation and a good polarization contrast. We determine\nthe orbital relaxation time $T_{1}$ of the orbitally split ground states and\nshow that all optical properties are conserved during translational\nnanomanipulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the rotation of the nanodiamonds.\nIn contrast to the translational operation, the rotation leads to a change in\npolarization contrast. We utilize the change in polarization contrast before\nand after nanomanipulation to determine the rotation angle. Finally, we\nevaluate the likelihood for indistinguishable, single photon emission of\nsilicon-vacancy centers located in different nanodiamonds. Our work enables\nideal evanescent, optical coupling of distant nanodiamonds containing\nsilicon-vacancy centers with applications in the realization of quantum\nnetworks, quantum repeaters or complex quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 12:48:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Oct 2019 12:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-03"}

Aims. To better establish the role that the magnetic field\nplays in the collapse of G31.41+0.31, we carried out Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the polarized dust\ncontinuum emission at 1.3 mm with an angular resolution four times higher than\nthat of the previous (sub)millimeter observations to achieve an unprecedented\nimage of the magnetic field morphology.

The resulting synthesized beam\nis 0.28\"x0\"20 which, at the distance of the source, corresponds to a spatial\nresolution of ~875 au. Results. The observations resolve the structure of the\nmagnetic field in G31.41+0.31 and allow us to study the field in detail. The\npolarized emission in the Main core of G31.41+0.41is successfully fit with a\nsemi-analytical magnetostatic model of a toroid supported by magnetic fields.\nThe best fit model suggests that the magnetic field is well represented by a\npoloidal field with a possible contribution of a toroidal component of ~10% of\nthe poloidal component, oriented southeast to northwest at ~ -44 deg and with\nan inclination of ~-45 degr. The magnetic field is oriented perpendicular to\nthe northeast to southwest velocity gradient detected in this core on scales\nfrom 1E3-1E4 au. This supports the hypothesis that the velocity gradient is due\nto rotation and suggests that such a rotation has little effect on the magnetic\nfield.

Spectroscopy\nenables measurement of dust properties, such as flux, temperature and covering\nfactor, with higher precision than photometry. In particular, it enables\nmeasurement of both luminosity-based dust radii and dust response times. Here\nwe report results from a one-year campaign on NGC 5548. The hot dust responds\nto changes in the irradiating flux with a lag time of ~70 light-days, similar\nto what was previously found in photometric reverberation campaigns. The mean\nand rms spectra are similar, implying that the same dust component dominates\nboth the emission and the variations. The dust lag time is consistent with the\nluminosity-based dust radius only if we assume a wavelength-independent dust\nemissivity-law, i.e. a blackbody, which is appropriate for grains of large\nsizes (of a few microns). For such grains the dust temperature is ~1450 K.\nTherefore, silicate grains have most likely evaporated and carbon is the main\nchemical component. But the hot dust is not close to its sublimation\ntemperature, contrary to popular belief. This is further supported by our\nobservation of temperature variations largely consistent with a heating/cooling\nprocess. Therefore, the inner dust-free region is enlarged and the dusty torus\nrather a \"dusty wall\", whose inner radius is expected to be\nluminosity-invariant. The dust-destruction mechanism that enlarges the\ndust-free region seems to partly affect also the dusty region. We observe a\ncyclical decrease in dust mass with implied dust reformation times of ~5-6\nmonths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 14:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}

Our simulations confirm that energy diffusion in the 2D\nmomentum-conserving lattices is anomalous and can be well described by the\nL\\'{e}vy-stable distribution. We also find that the disappear of side peaks of\nheat mode may suggest a weak coupling between heat mode and sound mode in the\n2D nonlinear system. It is also observed that the harmonic interactions in the\n2D nonlinear lattices can accelerate the energy diffusion. Contrary to the\nhypothesis of 1D system, we clarify that anomalous heat transport in the 2D\nmomentum-conserving system cannot be corroborated by the momentum\nsuperdiffusion any more. Moreover, as is expected, lattices with a nonlinear\non-site potential exhibit normal energy diffusion, independent of the\ndimension. Our findings offer some valuable insights into the mechanism of\nthermal transport in 2D system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2019 15:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

This resonates well with MOND, which hinges on accelerations. Relaxing\nGC affords more freedom in constructing MOND theories. I exemplify this with a\nsimplified theory whose gravitational Lagrangian is $\\mathcal{L}_M\\propto\n\\ell_M^{-2}\\mathcal{F}(\\ell_M^{2}\\mathcal{R})$, where $\\mathcal{R}= g^{\\mu\\nu}\n(\\Gamma^\\gamma_{\\mu\\nu}\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\lambda\\gamma}-\\Gamma^\\gamma_{\\mu\\lambda}\n\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\nu\\gamma})/2$. $\\Gamma^\\gamma_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the Levi-Civita\nconnection of a metric, $g_{\\mu\\nu}$, and $\\ell_M=c^2/a_0$ is the MOND length.\nRequiring $\\mathcal{F}(z)\\rightarrow z+\\zeta$, for $z\\gg 1$ gives GR with a\ncosmological constant $\\zeta c^{-4}a_0^2$ for high accelerations.

The latter theory is\nthus a covariantized version of the former a-la St\\\"{u}ckelberg.

Recently proposed Permutation Invariant Training (PIT) addresses\nthis problem by determining the output-label assignment which minimizes the\nseparation error. In this study, we show that a major drawback of this\ntechnique is the overconfident choice of the output-label assignment,\nespecially in the initial steps of training when the network generates\nunreliable outputs. To solve this problem, we propose Probabilistic PIT\n(Prob-PIT) which considers the output-label permutation as a discrete latent\nrandom variable with a uniform prior distribution. Prob-PIT defines a\nlog-likelihood function based on the prior distributions and the separation\nerrors of all permutations; it trains the speech separation networks by\nmaximizing the log-likelihood function. Prob-PIT can be easily implemented by\nreplacing the minimum function of PIT with a soft-minimum function. We evaluate\nour approach for speech separation on both TIMIT and CHiME datasets. The\nresults show that the proposed method significantly outperforms PIT in terms of\nSignal to Distortion Ratio and Signal to Interference Ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Aug 2019 17:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-07"}

While the\nabundance of data could improve the efficiency of the system, it poses major\nreliability challenges. In particular, state estimation aims to learn the\nbehavior of the network from data but an undetected attack on this problem\ncould lead to a large-scale blackout. Nevertheless, understanding vulnerability\nof state estimation against cyber attacks has been hindered by the lack of\ntools studying the topological and data-analytic aspects of the network.\nAlgorithmic robustness is of critical need to extract reliable information from\nabundant but untrusted grid data. We propose a robust state estimation\nframework that leverages network sparsity and data abundance. For a large-scale\npower grid, we quantify, analyze, and visualize the regions of the network\nprone to cyber attacks. We also propose an optimization-based graphical\nboundary defense mechanism to identify the border of the geographical area\nwhose data has been manipulated. The proposed method does not allow a local\nattack to have a global effect on the data analysis of the entire network,\nwhich enhances the situational awareness of the grid especially in the face of\nadversity. The developed mathematical framework reveals key geometric and\nalgebraic factors that can affect algorithmic robustness and is used to study\nthe vulnerability of the U.S. power grid in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Aug 2019 17:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-28"}
