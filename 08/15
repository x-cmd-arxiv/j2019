The Raman spectroscopy was conducted using three\ndifferent excitation lasers with the wavelengths of 325 nm (UV), 488 nm (blue),\nand 633 nm (red). The resonant UV-Raman spectroscopy reveals new spectral\nfeatures, which are not detectable via visible Raman light scattering. The\nthermal conductivity of FePS3 and MnPS3 thin films was measured by two\ndifferent techniques: the steady-state Raman optothermal and transient\ntime-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. The Raman optothermal measurements\nprovided the orientation-average thermal conductivity of FePS3 to be 1.35 W/mK\nat room temperature. The transient measurements revealed that the through-plane\nand in-plane thermal conductivity of FePS3 is 0.85 W/mK and 2.7 W/mK,\nrespectively. The films of MnPS3 have higher thermal conductivity of 1.1 W/mK\nthrough-plane and 6.3 W/mK in-plane. The data obtained by both techniques\nreveal strong thermal anisotropy of the films and the dominant contribution of\nphonons to heat conduction. Our results are important for the proposed\napplications of the antiferromagnetic semiconductor thin films in spintronic\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 16:02:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-24"}

Two of the most popular\nalgorithms for this problem, Count-Min and Count-Sketch, are widely used in\npractice.\n  In a recent work [Hsu et al., ICLR'19], it was shown empirically that\naugmenting Count-Min and Count-Sketch with a machine learning algorithm leads\nto a significant reduction of the estimation error. The experiments were\ncomplemented with an analysis of the expected error incurred by Count-Min (both\nthe standard and the augmented version) when the input frequencies follow a\nZipfian distribution. Although the authors established that the learned version\nof Count-Min has lower estimation error than its standard counterpart, their\nanalysis of the standard Count-Min algorithm was not tight. Moreover, they\nprovided no similar analysis for Count-Sketch.\n  In this paper we resolve these problems. First, we provide a simple tight\nanalysis of the expected error incurred by Count-Min. Second, we provide the\nfirst error bounds for both the standard and the augmented version of\nCount-Sketch. These bounds are nearly tight and again demonstrate an improved\nperformance of the learned version of Count-Sketch.\n  In addition to demonstrating tight gaps between the aforementioned\nalgorithms, we believe that our bounds for the standard versions of Count-Min\nand Count-Sketch are of independent interest. In particular, it is a typical\npractice to set the number of hash functions in those algorithms to $\\Theta\n(\\log n)$.

Lateral diffusion of protein aggregates or\nclusters on the surface of the PM plays an important role in governing their\nheterogeneous surface distribution. However, the stability behavior of the\nsurface distribution of protein aggregates remains poorly understood.\nTherefore, understanding the spatial patterns that can emerge on the PM solely\nthrough protein-protein interaction, lateral diffusion, and feedback is an\nimportant step towards a complete description of the mechanisms behind protein\nclustering on the cell surface. In this work, we investigate the pattern\nformation of a reaction-diffusion model that describes the dynamics of a system\nof ligand-receptor complexes.

In particular, we consider the following\nfour mobility models: (i) straight line (SL), (ii) random stop (RS), (iii)\nrandom walk (RW), and (iv) random waypoint (RWP), among which the SL mobility\nmodel is inspired by the simulation models used by the third generation\npartnership project (3GPP) for the placement and trajectory of drones, while\nthe other three are well-known canonical models (or their variants) that offer\na useful balance between realism and tractability. Assuming the\nnearest-neighbor association policy, we consider two service models for the\nUEs: (i) UE independent model (UIM), and (ii) UE dependent model (UDM). While\nthe serving DBS follows the same mobility model as the other DBSs in the UIM,\nit is assumed to fly towards the UE of interest in the UDM and hover above its\nlocation after reaching there. The main contribution of this paper is a unified\napproach to characterize the point process of DBSs for all the mobility and\nservice models. Using this, we provide exact mathematical expressions for the\naverage received rate and the session rate as seen by the typical UE. Further,\nusing tools from calculus of variations, we concretely demonstrate that the\nsimple SL mobility model provides a lower bound on the performance of other\ngeneral mobility models (including the ones in which drones follow curved\ntrajectories) as long as the movement of each drone in these models is\nindependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).

However, they do not always\nwork as expected. The imposition of a cordon sanitaire to control the 2014 West\nAfrican Ebola outbreak, for example, is argued to have led to a\nhigher-than-expected number of cases in the quarantined area. To determine when\nmobility restrictions reduce the size of an epidemic, we use a model of disease\ntransmission within and between economically heterogeneous locally connected\ncommunities. One community comprises a low-risk, resource-rich, low-density\npopulation with access to effective medical resources. The other comprises a\nhigh-risk, resource-poor, high-density population without access to effective\nmedical resources. We find that the overall size of an epidemic centered in the\nhigh-risk community is sensitive to the stringency of mobility restrictions\nbetween the two communities. Unrestricted mobility between the two risk\ncommunities increases the number of secondary cases in the low-risk community\nbut reduces the overall epidemic size. By contrast, the imposition of a cordon\nsanitaire around the high-risk community reduces the number of secondary\ninfections in the low-risk community but increases the overall epidemic size.\nThe degree to which mobility restrictions increase or decrease the overall\nepidemic size depends on the level of risk in each community and the\ncharacteristics of the disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 17:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

The vast\nmajority of existing approaches assume that the agents have the same design,\ne.g. same shape and action spaces. In this paper we address the problem of\ntransferring previously acquired skills amongst morphologically different\nagents (MDAs). For instance, assuming that a bipedal agent has been trained to\nmove forward, could this skill be transferred on to a one-leg hopper so as to\nmake its training process for the same task more sample efficient? We frame\nthis problem as one of subspace learning whereby we aim to infer latent factors\nrepresenting the control mechanism that is common between MDAs. We propose a\nnovel paired variational encoder-decoder model, PVED, that disentangles the\ncontrol of MDAs into shared and agent-specific factors.

Mayboroda [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109, 14761 (2012)] for the\nsingle-particle Schrodinger operator, to a wide class of interacting many-body\nHamiltonians. The many-body localization landscape (MBLL) is defined on a graph\nin the Fock space, whose nodes represent the basis vectors in the Fock space\nand edges correspond to transitions between the nodes connected by the hopping\nterm in the Hamiltonian. It is shown that in analogy to the single-particle\ncase, the inverse MBLL plays the role of an effective potential in the Fock\nspace. We construct a generalized discrete Agmon metric and prove Agmon\ninequalities and locality theorems on the Fock-state graph to obtain bounds on\nthe exponential decay of the many-body wave-functions in the Fock space. Using\nthe MBLL and the locator expansion, we provide considerable analytical evidence\nfor the existence of many-body localization for a wide-class of lattice models\nin any physical dimension for at least a part of their Hilbert space. The key\nto this argument is the observation that in sharp contrast to the conventional\nlocator expansion for the Green's function, the locator expansion for the\nlandscape function contains no resonances. For short-range hopping, which\nlimits the connectivity of the Fock-state graph, the locator series is proven\nto be convergent and bounded by a simple geometric series. This, in combination\nwith the Agmon inequalities and locality theorems, indicates that localization\nshould survive weak interactions and weak hopping for a subset of states in the\nHilbert space, but cannot prove or rule out localization of the other states.\nWe also qualitatively discuss potential breakdown of the locator expansion in\nthe MBLL for long-range hopping and the appearance of a mobility edge in\nhigher-dimensional theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 18:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 2019 21:22:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

Potential cold matter effects on the $b\n\\bar b$ pair observables are discussed to determine which are most likely to\nprovide insights about the system and why. Methods: The calculations, employing\nthe exclusive HVQMNR code, assume the same intrinsic $k_T$-broadening and\nfragmentation as in [R. Vogt, Phys. Rev. C {\\bf 98} (2018) 034907]. The pair\ndistributions presented by LHCb are calculated in this approach, both for the\nparent $b \\bar b$ and the $J/\\psi J/\\psi$ pairs produced in their decay. The\nsensitivity of the results to the intrinsic $k_T$ broadening is shown.

We present the first resolved images of the debris\ndisc around the young F-type star HD 160305, detected in scattered light using\nthe VLT/SPHERE instrument in the near infrared. Methods. We used a\npost-processing method based on angular differential imaging and synthetic\nimages of debris discs produced with a disc modelling code (GRaTer) to\nconstrain the main characteristics of the disc around HD 160305. All of the\npoint sources in the field of the IRDIS camera were analysed with an\nastrometric tool to determine whether they are bound objects or background\nstars. Results. We detect a very inclined (~ 82{\\deg}) ring-like debris disc\nlocated at a stellocentric distance of about 86au (deprojected width ~27 au).\nThe disc displays a brightness asymmetry between the two sides of the major\naxis, as can be expected from scattering properties of dust grains.

The results indicate that GCNs allow efficient extraction of coronary\nartery surface meshes and that the use of GCNs leads to regular and more\naccurate meshes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:48:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-16"}

Neural network architectures often contain more parameters\nthan training samples, and are so rich that they can interpolate the observed\nlabels, even if the latter are replaced by pure noise. Despite their huge\ncomplexity, the same architectures achieve small generalization error on real\ndata.\n  This phenomenon has been rationalized in terms of a so-called `double\ndescent' curve. As the model complexity increases, the test error follows the\nusual U-shaped curve at the beginning, first decreasing and then peaking around\nthe interpolation threshold (when the model achieves vanishing training error).\nHowever, it descends again as model complexity exceeds this threshold. The\nglobal minimum of the test error is found above the interpolation threshold,\noften in the extreme overparametrization regime in which the number of\nparameters is much larger than the number of samples. Far from being a peculiar\nproperty of deep neural networks, elements of this behavior have been\ndemonstrated in much simpler settings, including linear regression with random\ncovariates.\n  In this paper we consider the problem of learning an unknown function over\nthe $d$-dimensional sphere $\\mathbb S^{d-1}$, from $n$ i.i.d. samples\n$(\\boldsymbol x_i, y_i)\\in \\mathbb S^{d-1} \\times \\mathbb R$, $i\\le n$.

We compute the\nprecise asymptotics of the test error, in the limit $N,n,d\\to \\infty$ with\n$N/d$ and $n/d$ fixed. This provides the first analytically tractable model\nthat captures all the features of the double descent phenomenon without\nassuming ad hoc misspecification structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 21:23:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 04:38:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 04:18:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 08:25:04 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 04:06:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14"}

Such models associate the lowest energy state to the optimal\nconfiguration of variables under consideration, and are thus inherently\ndissipative. In this paper we propose an energy-efficient learning framework\nthat exploits structural and functional similarities between a machine learning\nnetwork and a general electrical network satisfying the Tellegen's theorem. In\ncontrast to the standard energy-based models, the proposed formulation\nassociates two energy components, namely, active and reactive energy to the\nnetwork. This ensures that the network's active-power is dissipated only during\nthe process of learning, whereas the reactive-power is maintained to be zero at\nall times. As a result, in steady-state, the learned parameters are stored and\nself-sustained by electrical resonance determined by the network's nodal\ninductances and capacitances. Based on this approach, this paper introduces\nthree novel concepts: (a) A learning framework where the network's active-power\ndissipation is used as a regularization for a learning objective function that\nis subjected to zero total reactive-power constraint; (b) A dynamical system\nbased on complex-domain, continuous-time growth transforms which optimizes the\nlearning objective function and drives the network towards electrical resonance\nunder steady-state operation; and (c) An annealing procedure that controls the\ntrade-off between active-power dissipation and the speed of convergence.

However, these studies have been\nfocused on materials where thermal conductivity $\\kappa$ is dominated by\nacoustic phonons, and the impact of four phonon scattering, although\nsignificant, is still generally smaller than three-phonon scattering. In this\nwork, taking AlSb as example, we demonstrated that four-phonon scattering is\neven more critical to three-phonon scattering as it diminishes optical phonon\nthermal transport, and therefore significantly reduces the thermal\nconductivities of materials in which optical branches have long three-phonon\nlifetimes. Also, our calculations show that four-phonon scattering can play an\nextremely important role in weakening the isotope effect on $\\kappa$.\nSpecifically, four-phonon scattering reduces the room-temperature $\\kappa$ of\nthe isotopically pure and natural-occurring AlSb by 70$\\%$ and 50$\\%$,\nrespectively. The reduction for isotopically pure and natural-occurring c-GaN\nis about 34$\\%$ and 27$\\%$, respectively. For isotopically-pure w-GaN, the\nreduction is about 13$\\%$ at room temperature and 25$\\%$ at 400 K. These\nresults provided important guidance for experimentalists for achieving high\nthermal conductivities in III-V compounds for applications in semiconductor\nindustry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 03:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

While techniques for synthesizing Boolean\nshields are well understood, they do not handle real-valued signals ubiquitous\nin cyber-physical systems, meaning corrections may be either unrealizable or\ninefficient to compute in the real domain. We solve the realizability and\nefficiency problems by statically analyzing the compatibility of predicates\ndefined over real-valued signals, and using the analysis result to constrain a\ntwo-player safety game used to synthesize the shield.

Previous works tackle the unpaired\ncross-lingual image captioning problem through a pivot language, which is with\nthe help of paired image-caption data in the pivot language and pivot-to-target\nmachine translation models. However, such language-pivoted approach suffers\nfrom inaccuracy brought by the pivot-to-target translation, including\ndisfluency and visual irrelevancy errors.

Consequently, cryptocurrencies\nare more appropriately described as crypto assets. A common investment\nattribute shared by the more than 2,500 crypto assets is that they are highly\nvolatile. An investor interested in reducing price volatility of a portfolio of\ncrypto assets can do so by constructing an optimal portfolio through standard\noptimization techniques that minimize tail risk. Because crypto assets are not\nbacked by any real assets, forming a hedge to reduce the risk contribution of a\nsingle crypto asset can only be done with another set of similar assets (i.e.,\na set of other crypto assets). A major finding of this paper is that crypto\nportfolios constructed via optimizations that minimize variance and Conditional\nValue at Risk outperform a major stock market index (the S$\\&$P 500). As of\nthis writing, options in which the underlying is a crypto asset index are not\ntraded, one of the reasons being that the academic literature has not\nformulated an acceptable fair pricing model. We offer a fair valuation model\nfor crypto asset options based on a dynamic pricing model for the underlying\ncrypto assets. The model was carefully backtested and therefore offers a\nreliable model for the underlying crypto assets in the natural world. We then\nobtain the valuation of crypto options by passing the natural world to the\nequivalent martingale measure via the Esscher transform. Because of the absence\nof traded crypto options we could not compare the prices obtained from our\nvaluation model to market prices. Yet, we can claim that if such options on\ncrypto assets are introduced, they should follow closely our theoretical prices\nafter adjusting for market frictions and design feature nuances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 04:55:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-15"}

While much of collaborative ranking methodology assumes static\nranking data, the importance of temporal information to improving ranking\nperformance is increasingly apparent. Recent advances in deep learning,\nespecially the discovery of various attention mechanisms and newer\narchitectures in addition to widely used RNN and CNN in natural language\nprocessing, have allowed us to make better use of the temporal ordering of\nitems that each user has engaged with. In particular, the SASRec model,\ninspired by the popular Transformer model in natural languages processing, has\nachieved state-of-art results in the temporal collaborative ranking problem and\nenjoyed more than 10x speed-up when compared to earlier CNN/RNN-based methods.\nHowever, SASRec is inherently an un-personalized model and does not include\npersonalized user embeddings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a\nPersonalized Transformer (SSE-PT) model, outperforming SASRec by almost 5% in\nterms of NDCG@10 on 5 real-world datasets. Furthermore, after examining some\nrandom users' engagement history and corresponding attention heat maps used\nduring the inference stage, we find our model is not only more interpretable\nbut also able to focus on recent engagement patterns for each user.

However, as evidenced by prior work, the resulted RNN models suffer\nfrom prediction errors accumulation, leading to undesired discontinuities in\nmotion prediction. In this paper, we propose a simple feed-forward deep network\nfor motion prediction, which takes into account both temporal smoothness and\nspatial dependencies among human body joints. In this context, we then propose\nto encode temporal information by working in trajectory space, instead of the\ntraditionally-used pose space. This alleviates us from manually defining the\nrange of temporal dependencies (or temporal convolutional filter size, as done\nin previous work). Moreover, spatial dependency of human pose is encoded by\ntreating a human pose as a generic graph (rather than a human skeletal\nkinematic tree) formed by links between every pair of body joints. Instead of\nusing a pre-defined graph structure, we design a new graph convolutional\nnetwork to learn graph connectivity automatically. This allows the network to\ncapture long range dependencies beyond that of human kinematic tree. We\nevaluate our approach on several standard benchmark datasets for motion\nprediction, including Human3.6M, the CMU motion capture dataset and 3DPW. Our\nexperiments clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state of\nthe art performance, and is applicable to both angle-based and position-based\npose representations.

The packets are transmitted to the destination\nby using finite blocklength coding to update the status (e.g., temperature,\nspeed, position) of the monitored process. In some applications, such as\nreal-time monitoring and tracking, the timeliness of the status updates is\ncritical since the users are interested in the latest condition of the process.\nThe timeliness of the status updates can be reflected by a recently proposed\nmetric, termed the age of information (AoI). We focus on the packet management\npolicies for the considered system. Specifically, the preemption and discard of\nstatus updates are important to decrease the AoI. For example, it is\nmeaningless to transmit stale status updates when a new status update is\ngenerated. We propose three packet management schemes in the transmission\nbetween the source and the destination, namely non-preemption (NP), preemption\n(PR) and retransmission (RT) schemes. We derive closed-form expressions of the\naverage AoI for the proposed three schemes. Based on the derived analytical\nexpressions of the average AoI, we further minimize the average AoI by\noptimizing the packet blocklength for each status update. Simulation results\nare provided to validate our theoretical analysis, which further show that the\nproposed schemes can outperform each other for different system setups, and the\nproposed schemes considerably outperform the existing ones without packet\nmanagement at medium to high generation rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 07:37:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 07:33:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-20"}

This has presented challenges to the\nlearning process and the capability of neural networks. We propose a method to\naddress this issue in large MDPs with sparse rewards, in which exploration and\nrouting across remote states are both extremely challenging. Our method\nexplicitly models the environment in a hierarchical manner, with a high-level\ndynamic landmark-based map abstracting the visited state space, and a low-level\nvalue network to derive precise local decisions. We use farthest point sampling\nto select landmark states from past experience, which has improved exploration\ncompared with simple uniform sampling.

However, these campaigns only monitored X-rays below $10$\nkeV, whereas the bolometric luminosity for most of these AGN peaks above $50$\nkeV. We use data from the recent multiwavelength campaign by \\cite{E17} on NGC\n4151 - the only AGN bright enough to be monitored at higher energies with\n\\textit{Swift} BAT. We develop a spectral-timing model with a hot corona, warm\nComptonisation, and outer standard disc. This fits the time-averaged spectrum\nwell, but completely fails to match the UV variability predicted from the X-ray\nlightcurve. However, it reveals that NGC 4151 had a bolometric luminosity\naround $1.4\\%$ of the Eddington luminosity during this campaign, close to the\nluminosity at which AGN show a `changing-state' transition, where the broad\noptical lines disappear. Stellar mass black holes show a state transition at a\nsimilarly low Eddington fraction, which is broadly interpreted as the inner\ndisc being replaced by an optically thin flow. We find that the UV lightcurve\ncan instead be matched by reprocessing of the X-ray flux on size scales of the\nbroad line region (BLR; $1.5-20$ light-days) and rule out there being optically\nthick material inwards of this, as expected if the thin disc is replaced by the\nflow below the inner radius of the BLR. These results emphasise the need for\neven longer-timescale, multiwavelength monitoring campaigns on variable AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 09:12:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 15:16:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

However, recent studies show that critical transitions\ncan also be triggered by dangerous rates of environmental change. In contrast\nto classical regime shifts, such rate-induced critical transitions do not\ninvolve any obvious loss of stability, or a bifurcation, and thus cannot be\nexplained by the linear stability analysis. In this work, we demonstrate that\nthe well-known Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model can undergo a\nrate-induced critical transition in response to a continuous decline in the\nhabitat quality, resulting in a collapse of the predator and prey populations.\nRather surprisingly, the collapse occurs even if the environmental change is\nslower than the slowest process in the model. To explain this counterintuitive\nphenomenon, we combine methods from geometric singular perturbation theory with\nthe concept of a moving equilibrium, and study critical rates of environmental\nchange with dependence on the initial state and the system parameters.\nMoreover, for a fixed rate of environmental change, we determine the set of\ninitial states that undergo a rate-induced population collapse. Our results\nsuggest that ecosystems may be more sensitive to how fast environmental\nconditions change than previously assumed. In particular, unexpected critical\ntransitions with dramatic ecological consequences can be triggered by\nenvironmental changes that (i) do not exceed any dangerous levels, and (ii) are\nslower than the natural timescales of the ecosystem. This poses an interesting\nresearch question whether regime shifts observed in the natural world are\npredominantly rate-induced or bifurcation-induced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 12:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-16"}

However, the existing hardware severely limits the size of the\nimages that can be generated. The rapid growth of high dimensional data in many\nfields of science therefore poses a significant challenge for generative\nmodels. In cosmology, the large-scale, three-dimensional matter distribution,\nmodeled with N-body simulations, plays a crucial role in understanding the\nevolution of the universe. As these simulations are computationally very\nexpensive, GANs have recently generated interest as a possible method to\nemulate these datasets, but they have been, so far, mostly limited to two\ndimensional data. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for the generation\nof three dimensional N-body simulations, in order to stimulate new ideas in the\nmachine learning community and move closer to the practical use of generative\nmodels in cosmology. As a first benchmark result, we propose a scalable GAN\napproach for training a generator of N-body three-dimensional cubes.

A\ntwo-level domain decomposition method requires two main components: a one-level\npreconditioner (or its corresponding smoothing iterative method), which is\nbased on domain decomposition techniques, and a coarse correction step, which\nrelies on a coarse space. The coarse space must properly represent the error\ncomponents that the chosen one-level method is not capable to deal with. In the\nliterature most of the works introduced efficient coarse spaces obtained as the\nspan of functions defined on the entire space domain of the considered PDE.\nTherefore, the corresponding two-level preconditioners and iterative methods\nare defined in volume.\n  In this paper, a new class of substructured two-level methods is\nintroduced,for which both domain decomposition smoothers and coarse correction\nsteps are defined on the interfaces (or skeletons). This approach has several\nadvantages. On the one hand, the required computational effort is cheaper than\nthe one required by classical volumetric two-level methods. On the other hand,\nit allows one to use some of the well-known efficient coarse spaces proposed in\nthe literature.

Identifying\npathways towards a sustainable future in these models for informing policy\nmakers and the wider public, e.g. pathways leading to a robust mitigation of\ndangerous anthropogenic climate change, is a challenging and widely\ninvestigated task in the field of climate research and broader Earth system\nscience. This problem is particularly difficult when constraints on avoiding\ntransgressions of planetary boundaries and social foundations need to be taken\ninto account. In this work, we propose to combine recently developed machine\nlearning techniques, namely deep reinforcement learning (DRL), with classical\nanalysis of trajectories in the World-Earth system.

On the other hand, near-equilibrium free-energies\nare easily accessible but their full geometry is only explored in\nnon-equilibrium, e.g. after a quench. In the particular case of a\nnon-stationary system, however, the concepts of an order parameter and free\nenergy become ill-defined, and a comprehensive understanding of non-stationary\n(transient) phase transitions is still lacking. Here, we probe transient\nnon-equilibrium dynamics of an optically pumped, dye-filled microcavity which\nexhibits near-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation under steady-state\nconditions. By rapidly exciting a large number of dye molecules, we quench the\nsystem to a far-from-equilibrium state and, close to a critical excitation\nenergy, find delayed condensation, interpreted as a transient equivalent of\ncritical slowing down. We introduce the two-time, non-stationary, second-order\ncorrelation function as a powerful experimental tool for probing the\nstatistical properties of the transient relaxation dynamics. In addition to\nnumber fluctuations near the critical excitation energy, we show that transient\nphase transitions exhibit a different form of diverging fluctuations, namely\ntiming jitter in the growth of the order parameter. This jitter is seeded by\nthe randomness associated with spontaneous emission, with its effect being\namplified near the critical point.

Our main focus is on nonlinear differential equations with\nmultiscale coefficients. The framework is built on nonlinear nonlocal\nmulti-continuum upscaling concept and significantly extends the results in the\nproceeding paper.\n  Our approach starts with a coarse space-time partition and identifies test\nfunctions for each partition, which plays a role of multi-continua. The test\nfunctions are defined via optimization and play a crucial role in nonlinear\nupscaling. In the second stage, we solve nonlinear local problems in\noversampled regions with some constraints defined via test functions. These\nlocal solutions define a nonlinear map from macroscopic variables determined\nwith the help of test functions to the fine-grid fields. This map can be\nthought as a downscaled map from macroscopic variables to the fine-grid\nsolution. In the final stage, we seek macroscopic variables in the entire\ndomain such that the downscaled field solves the global problem in a weak sense\ndefined using the test functions. We present an analysis of our approach for an\nexample nonlinear problem.\n  Our unified framework plays an important role in designing various upscaled\nmethods.

In this work, we\npresent the Pixel Space COnvolver (PISCO), a new software tool capable of\nproducing mock data streams for a general CMB experiment. PISCO uses a fully\npolarized representation of the electromagnetic properties of the telescope.\nPISCO also exploits the massively parallel architecture of Graphic Processing\nUnits to accelerate the main calculation. This work shows the results of\napplying PISCO in several scenarios, included a realistic simulation of an\nongoing experiment, the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 18:37:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 16:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

They operate by partitioning each job into smaller\ntasks executed on different servers. The servers also need to exchange\nintermediate values to complete the computation. Experimental evidence suggests\nthat this so-called Shuffle phase can be a significant part of the overall\nexecution time for several classes of jobs. Prior work has demonstrated a\nnatural tradeoff between computation and communication whereby running\nredundant copies of jobs can reduce the Shuffle traffic load, thereby leading\nto reduced overall execution times. For a single job, the main drawback of this\napproach is that it requires the original job to be split into a number of\nfiles that grows exponentially in the system parameters. When extended to\nmultiple jobs (with specific function types), these techniques suffer from a\nlimitation of a similar flavor, i.e., they require an exponentially large\nnumber of jobs to be executed.

For the simulation of flows accompanied\nby the advection-diffusion transport of a scalar field, double distribution\nfunctions (DDF) based lattice Boltzmann methods (LBMs) are commonly used. We\npresent a new local vorticity computation approach by introducing an\nintensional anisotropy of the scalar flux in the third order, off-diagonal\nmoment equilibria of the LB scheme for the scalar field, and then combining the\nsecond order non-equilibrium components of both the LBMs. As such, any pair of\nlattice sets in the DDF formulation that can independently support the third\norder off-diagonal moments would enable local determination of the complete\nflow kinematics, with the LBMs for the fluid motion and the transport of the\npassive scalar respectively providing the necessary moment relationships to\ndetermine the symmetric and skew-symmetric components of the velocity gradient\ntensor. Since the resulting formulation is completely local and do not rely on\nfinite difference approximations for velocity derivatives, it is by design\nnaturally suitable for parallel computation. As an illustration of our\napproach, we formulate a DDF-LB scheme for local vorticity computation using a\npair of multiple relaxation times (MRT) based collision approaches on\ntwo-dimensional, nine velocity (D2Q9) lattices, where the necessary moment\nrelationships to determine the velocity gradient tensor and the vorticity are\nestablished via a Chapman-Enskog analysis.

We consider viewing metabolism in living things\nas microscopic variables directly driven by the second law of thermodynamics,\nwhile viewing the macroscopic variables of structure, complexity and\nhomeostasis as mechanisms that are entropically favored because they open\nchannels for entropy to grow via metabolism. This perspective reverses the\nconventional relation between structure and metabolism, by emphasizing the role\nof structure for metabolism rather than the other way around. Structure extends\nin time, preserving information along generations, particularly in the genetic\ncode, but also in human culture. We also consider why the increase in\norder/complexity over time is often stepwise and sometimes collapses\ncatastrophically. We point out the relevance of the notions of metastable\nstates and channels between these, which are discovered by random motion of the\nsystem and lead it into ever-larger regions of the phase space, driven by\nthermodynamics. We note that such changes in state can lead to either increase\nor decrease in order; and sometimes to complete collapse, as in biological\nextinction.

As\nan alternative to standard, uniformly sampled images, we propose the use of\nfoveated image sampling here to reduce the size of images, which are faster to\nprocess in a CNN due to the reduced number of convolution operations. We\nevaluate object detection and recognition on the Microsoft COCO database, using\nfoveated image sampling at different image sizes, ranging from 416x416 to 96x96\npixels, on an embedded GPU -- an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 with 256 CUDA cores.

Examples of dielectrics are crystalline materials such as\nquartz and sapphire, and amorphous glasses. The interaction between femtosecond\nlaser pulses, at a wavelength with negligible linear absorption, and a\ndielectric has been found to be weak, and multiple pulse irradiation is\ntherefore typically used in order to see significant and quantifiable effects.\nIn this study the dielectric is the crystalline, layered, natural mineral\nmuscovite, a mica with formula KAl_2 (Si_3 Al) O_10 (OH)_2. Muscovite, newly\ncleaved, is used in a wide range of technological and scientific applications\nincluding as an insulating material in electronics and as an ultra-flat and\nultra-clean substrate. A single, ~800 nm wavelength, ~6 micron spotsize, ~150\nfs laser pulse is found to lead to a systematic range of laser modification\ntopologies, as a function of the fluence of the single laser pulse, including\nbulk removal of material. The fs laser pulse/material interaction is greater\nthan expected for a standard dielectric at a given fluence. Optical surface\nprofiling and FESEM are used to characterise the topologies. Contrasting the\nresults of the two techniques supports the use of optical surface profiling to\ncharacterise the material modification despite its limitations in lateral\nresolution as compared to FESEM. The interlayer mineral water content of\nnatural muscovite is proposed as the primary reason that mica behaves\ndifferently to a standard dielectric when irradiated with a single 800 nm fs\nlaser pulse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 08:09:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}
