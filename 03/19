We focus on the effect of the canopy on the background\nturbulence, the part of the flow that remains once the element-induced flow is\nfiltered out. In channel flows, the distribution of the total stress is linear\nwith height. Over smooth walls, the total stress is only the `fluid stress'\n$\\tau_f$, the sum of the viscous and the Reynolds shear stresses. In canopies,\nin turn, there is an additional contribution from the canopy drag, which can\ndominate within. We find that, for sparse canopies, the ratio of the viscous\nand the Reynolds shear stresses in $\\tau_f$ at each height is similar to that\nover smooth-walls, even within the canopy. From this, a height-dependent\nscaling based on $\\tau_f$ is proposed. Using this scaling, the background\nturbulence within the canopy shows similarities with turbulence over smooth\nwalls. This suggests that the background turbulence scales with $\\tau_f$,\nrather than with the conventional scaling based on the total stress. This\neffect is essentially captured when the canopy is substituted by a drag force\nthat acts on the mean velocity profile alone, aiming to produce the correct\n$\\tau_f$, without the discrete presence of the canopy elements acting directly\non the fluctuations. The proposed mean-only forcing is shown to produce better\nestimates for the turbulent fluctuations compared to a conventional,\nhomogeneous-drag model. The present results thus suggest that a sparse canopy\nacts on the background turbulence primarily through the change it induces on\nthe mean velocity profile, which in turn sets the scale for turbulence, rather\nthan through a direct interaction of the canopy elements with the fluctuations.\nThe effect of the element-induced flow, however, requires the representation of\nthe individual canopy elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 16:26:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 2019 12:16:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2020 14:55:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

The collective properties of interacting systems exhibiting such\nanomalous diffusive dynamics, which we call active L\\'evy matter, cannot be\ncaptured by current active fluid theories. Here, we formulate a hydrodynamic\ntheory of active L\\'evy matter by coarse-graining a microscopic model of\naligning polar active particles that perform superdiffusion akin to L\\'evy\nflights. Applying a linear stability analysis on the hydrodynamic equations at\nthe onset of collective motion, we find that, in contrast to its conventional\ncounterpart, the order-disorder transition can become critical. We then\nestimate the corresponding critical exponents by finite size scaling analysis\nof numerical simulations.

The rate of a computation broadcast scheme is\ndefined as the ratio $H(W_1,W_2)/H(S)$, where $S$ is the information broadcast\nto both users to simultaneously satisfy their demands.

Combining the LMC DEBs, masers in NGC\n4258 and Milky Way parallaxes yields our best estimate: H0 = 74.03 +/- 1.42\nkm/s/Mpc, including systematics, an uncertainty of 1.91%---15% lower than our\nbest previous result. Removing any one of these anchors changes H0 by < 0.7%.\nThe difference between H0 measured locally and the value inferred from Planck\nCMB+LCDM is 6.6+/-1.5 km/s/Mpc or 4.4 sigma (P=99.999% for Gaussian errors) in\nsignificance, raising the discrepancy beyond a plausible level of chance. We\nsummarize independent tests which show this discrepancy is not readily\nattributable to an error in any one source or measurement, increasing the odds\nthat it results from a cosmological feature beyond LambdaCDM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 17:50:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 15:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

Thanks to a set of state-of-the-art direct N-body simulations with up to\n200k particles inclusive of stellar evolution, primordial binaries, and varying\nBH/neutron stars, we highlight for the first time the existence of a clear and\ntight linear relation between the degree of mass segregation and the cluster\nstructural concentration index.

Our constructions also\nprovide a natural realization of the $R$-filtration of the associated VOA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2019 12:57:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 2019 20:17:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-22"}

A simple set of assumptions are empirically\njustified and then used to predict how many such precursors formed between\nredshift 3 and 10 could actually be detected by the NIRCam instrument on board\nof JWST. It is shown that the near power-law shape of the rest-frame UV\ncontinuum of young globular cluster precursors (GCP) implies that both colours\nand luminosities in NIRCam long-wavelength passbands depend remarkably weakly\non formation redshift. Thus, the predicted number counts depend only little on\nthe actual formation redshifts in the mentioned range, with the exception of\nthe bluest passbands for which counts can be strongly suppressed by\nintergalactic absorption along the line of sight. Instead, counts depend\nstrongly on the actual mass of GCPs, in such a way that one NIRCam pointing\nshould detect of the order of 10 GCPs to mag$\\sim 30$ if their mass\ndistribution was the same of today GCs, or over 1,000 if their mass was 10\ntimes higher. Therefore, GCP number counts will set fairly tight constraints on\nthe initial mass of GCs. An encouraging agreement with the number density of\ncandidate GCPs at $z=6-8$, revealed by the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF)\nprogram, suggests that their initial mass could be at least 4 times higher than\nthat of their local descendants if all were to end up as GCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 18:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

The liquidlike regime of a LJ fluid (P =\n5000 bars, T = 300 K), mimicking argon, partially confined between walls\nseparated by 10 {\\AA} along the z-axis, and otherwise unconstrained, reveals\namorphous and liquidlike structural signatures in the radial distribution\nfunction parallel to the walls and enhanced self-diffusion as the wall\nstiffness is decreased.

We describe a method for detecting \"ecological communities\" within\nthese networks based on shared activity locations among individuals.\nSpecifically, we identify latent activity pattern profiles, which, for each\ncommunity, summarize its members' probability distribution of going to each\nlocation, and community assignment vectors, which, for each individual,\nsummarize his/her probability distribution of belonging to each community.\nUsing data from the Adolescent Health and Development in Context (AHDC) Study,\nwe employ latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to identify activity pattern\nprofiles and communities.

The\nfracture behaviour of the monolayer graphene was followed by deforming the PMMA\nbeams. Through in-situ Raman mapping at different strain levels, the\ndistributions of strain over the graphene flakes were determined from the shift\nof the graphene Raman 2D band. The failure mechanisms of the exfoliated\ngraphene were either by flake fracture or failure of the graphene/polymer\ninterface. The fracture of the flakes was observed from the formation of cracks\nidentified from the appearance of lines of zero strain in the strain contour\nmaps. It was found that the strength of the monolayer graphene flakes decreased\nwith increasing flake width. The strength dropped to less than 10 GPa for large\nflakes, much lower than the reported value of 130 GPa for monolayer graphene,\nthought to be due to the presence of defects.

In these circumstances it is imperative to expedite\nprediction without a significant compromise in the model's fidelity, which in\nturn relies on the rapid assembly and solution of the associated system of\nequations typically at the many-query context. Our approach involves converting\nthe solution of the linear, symmetric positive definite FEM system into an\nover-determined least squares problem, whose solution is then projected onto a\nlow-dimensional subspace. The resulting low-dimensional system can be\neffectively sketched as a product of two high-dimensional matrices using a\nparameter-dependent non-uniform sampling distribution, utilising only a small\nsubset of the model's parameters. Although different to the optimal sampling\ndistributions based on the statistical leverage-scores of the rows of the\nmatrices, we show that the distance between them shrinks for an appropriate\nchoice of the projection subspace.

This analysis is computationally\nintensive and typically performed offline. Online, however, the autonomous\nsystem may experience changes in system dynamics, external disturbances, and/or\nthe surrounding environment, requiring updated safety guarantees. Rather than\nrestarting the safety analysis, we propose a method of \"warm-start\"\nreachability, which uses a user-defined initialization (typically the\npreviously computed solution). By starting with an HJI function that is closer\nto the solution than the standard initialization, convergence may take fewer\niterations.\n  In this paper we prove that warm-starting will result in guaranteed\nconservative solutions by over-approximating the states that must be avoided to\nmaintain safety. We additionally prove that for many common problem\nformulations, warm-starting will result in exact solutions.We demonstrate our\nmethod on several illustrative examples with a double integrator, and also on a\nmore practical example with a 10D quadcopter model that experiences changes in\nmass and disturbances and must update its safety guarantees accordingly.

Transformation multipliers (cf. plastic multipliers) are\nintroduced, from which the martensite volume fraction evolution ensues.

At the current stage, there are various competing responses to\nthis challenge under construction. Attacking the problem of quantum gravity\nfrom the quantum geometry perspective, where space and spacetime are discrete,\nthe focus of this thesis lies on the application of loop quantum gravity (LQG)\nand group field theory (GFT). We employ these two closely related\nnonperturbative approaches to two areas where quantum gravity effects are\nbroadly expected to be relevant: black holes and quantum cosmology.\n  Concerning black holes, apart from understanding their inner structure, a\npressing issue is to give a microscopic explanation for the phenomenon of black\nhole entropy in terms of a discrete quantum geometry and relate it to the\nsymmetries of the horizon. Black hole models in LQG are typically constructed\nvia the isolated horizon boundary condition which gives rise to an effective\ndescription of the horizon geometry in terms SU(2) Chern-Simons theory. In this\nthesis we find a reinterpretation of the statistics of the horizon degrees of\nfreedom as those of a system of non-Abelian anyons.\n  As regards quantum cosmology, the challenge is to understand how the initial\nsingularity problem of GR can be resolved by means of the discreteness of\ngeometry and how a continuum spacetime can emerge from a large assembly of\ngeometric building blocks. Most recent research in GFT aims at deriving the\neffective dynamics for condensate states directly from the microscopic GFT\nquantum dynamics and subsequently to extract a cosmological interpretation from\nthem. In this thesis we elaborate on aspects of this approach and study\nphenomenological consequences in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 21:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

PyBioNetFit is designed for parameterization, and also supports\nuncertainty quantification, checking models against known system properties,\nand solving design problems. PyBioNetFit introduces the Biological Property\nSpecification Language (BPSL) for the formal declaration of system properties.\nBPSL allows qualitative data to be used alone or in combination with\nquantitative data for parameterization model checking, and design. PyBioNetFit\nperforms parameterization with parallelized metaheuristic optimization\nalgorithms (differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, scatter\nsearch) that work directly with existing model definition standards: BioNetGen\nLanguage (BNGL) and Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). We demonstrate\nPyBioNetFit's capabilities by solving 31 example problems, including the\nchallenging problem of parameterizing a model of cell cycle control in yeast.\nWe benchmark PyBioNetFit's parallelization efficiency on computer clusters,\nusing up to 288 cores. Finally, we demonstrate the model checking and design\napplications of PyBioNetFit and BPSL by analyzing a model of therapeutic\ninterventions in autophagy signaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 22:52:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

On one hand, pull-based engines can achieve higher throughput\nbecause their workloads are read-dominant, rather than write-dominant, and can\nproceed without synchronization between threads. On the other hand, push-based\nengines are much better able to take advantage of the frontier optimization,\nwhich leverages the fact that often only a small subset of the graph needs to\nbe accessed to complete an iteration of a graph processing application. Hybrid\nengines attempt to overcome this trade-off by dynamically switching between\npush and pull, but there are two key disadvantages with this approach. First,\napplications must be implemented twice (once for push and once for pull), and\nsecond, processing throughput is reduced for iterations that run with push.\n  We propose a radically different solution: rebuild the frontier optimization\nentirely such that it is well-suited for a pull-based engine. In doing so, we\nremove the only advantage that a push-based engine had over a pull-based\nengine, making it possible to eliminate the push-based engine entirely. We\nintroduce Wedge, a pull-only graph processing framework that transforms the\ntraditional source-oriented vertex-based frontier into a pull-friendly format\ncalled the Wedge Frontier. The transformation itself is expensive even when\nparallelized, so we introduce two key optimizations to make it practical.\nFirst, we perform the transformation only when the resulting Wedge Frontier is\nsufficiently sparse. Second, we coarsen the granularity of the representation\nof elements in the Wedge Frontier. These optimizations respectively improve\nWedge's performance by up to 5x and 2x, enabling it to outperform Grazelle,\nLigra, and GraphMat respectively by up to 2.8x, 4.9x, and 185.5x.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 22:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

The major issue of processing such variational B-rep models (in\nthe STEP format) is that free motions of a well-constrained model involve more\nthan just rigid-body motions. The fundamental difficulty lies in having a\nsystematic description of what pattern these free motions follow. This paper\nproposes a geometric perturbation method to study these free motions. This\nmethod is a generalization of the witness method, allowing it to directly deal\nwith variational B-rep models represented with the standard STEP scheme. This\ngeneralization is essentially achieved by using a direct, geometric\nrepresentation of the free motions, and then expressing the free motions in\nterms of composites of several basis motions. To demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed method, a series of comparisons and case studies are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 23:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

We achieve this by eliminating the use of the ephemeral\npublic key (i.e, commitment) in Schnorr-type signatures from the signing via a\ndistributed construction at the verifier without interaction with the signer\nwhile permitting a constant-size public key.

At its core, Umbrella develops a multi-layered\ndefense architecture to defend against a wide spectrum of DDoS attacks.

In particular, state-of-the-art methods tend to\nunder-segment faint vessels, as well as pixels that lie on the edges of thicker\nvessels. Thus, they underestimate the width of individual vessels, as well as\nthe ratio of large to small vessels. More generally, many crucial\nbio-markers---including the artery-vein (AV) ratio, branching angles, number of\nbifurcation, fractal dimension, tortuosity, vascular length-to-diameter ratio\nand wall-to-lumen length---require precise measurements of individual vessels.\nTo address this limitation, we propose a novel, stochastic training scheme for\ndeep neural networks that better classifies the faint, ambiguous regions of the\nimage. Our approach relies on two key innovations. First, we train our deep\nnetworks with dynamic weights that fluctuate during each training iteration.\nThis stochastic approach forces the network to learn a mapping that robustly\nbalances precision and recall.

To this end, we formulate sufficient and\nnecessary conditions for the safety of a given set based on discrete-time\nbarrier functions (DTBFs) and we demonstrate that our formulation also allows\nfor Boolean compositions of DTBFs for representing more complicated safe sets.\nWe show that the proposed method can be implemented online by a sequence of\none-step greedy algorithms as a standalone safe controller or as a\nsafety-filter given a nominal planning policy. We illustrate the efficiency of\nthe proposed methodology based on DTBFs using a high-fidelity simulation of\nheterogeneous robots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 04:23:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 2019 05:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-13"}

The space limit in urban warehouses\nposes a problem for the online retailers: the number of products (SKUs) they\ncarry is no longer \"the more, the better\", yet it can still be significantly\nlarge, reaching hundreds or thousands in a product category. In this paper, we\nstudy algorithms for dynamically identifying a large number of products (i.e.,\nSKUs) with top customer purchase probabilities on the fly, from an ocean of\npotential products to offer on retailers' ultra-fast delivery platforms.\n  We distill the product selection problem into a semi-bandit model with linear\ngeneralization. There are in total $N$ different arms, each with a feature\nvector of dimension $d$. The player pulls $K$ arms in each period and observes\nthe bandit feedback from each of the pulled arms. We focus on the setting where\n$K$ is much greater than the number of total time periods $T$ or the dimension\nof product features $d$. We first analyze a standard UCB algorithm and show its\nregret bound can be expressed as the sum of a $T$-independent part $\\tilde O(K\nd^{3/2})$ and a $T$-dependent part $\\tilde O(d\\sqrt{KT})$, which we refer to as\n\"fixed cost\" and \"variable cost\" respectively. To reduce the fixed cost for\nlarge $K$ values, we propose a novel online learning algorithm, which\niteratively shrinks the upper confidence bounds within each period, and show\nits fixed cost is reduced by a factor of $d$ to $\\tilde O(K \\sqrt{d})$.\nMoreover, we test the algorithms on an industrial dataset from Alibaba Group.\nExperimental results show that our new algorithm reduces the total regret of\nthe standard UCB algorithm by at least 10%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 05:34:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 19:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-06"}

However, a great challenge in UBQC is how to transmit\nquantum state over long distance securely and reliably. Here, we solve this\nchallenge by proposing and demonstrating a resource-efficient remote blind\nqubit preparation (RBQP) protocol with weak coherent pulses for the client to\nproduce, using a compact and low-cost laser. We demonstrate the protocol in\nfield, experimentally verifying the protocol over 100-km fiber. Our experiment\nuses a quantum teleportation setup in telecom wavelength and generates $1000$\nsecure qubits with an average fidelity of $(86.9\\pm1.5)\\%$, which exceeds the\nquantum no-cloning fidelity of equatorial qubit states. The results prove the\nfeasibility of UBQC over long distances, and thus serving as a key milestone\ntowards secure cloud quantum computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 07:14:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 08:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-06"}

To address this issue, we propose a\nclass-incremental learning paradigm called Deep Model Consolidation (DMC),\nwhich works well even when the original training data is not available.

The two existing models are consolidated by exploiting publicly\navailable unlabeled auxiliary data. This overcomes the potential difficulties\ndue to the unavailability of original training data.

We describe two methods taking a step in this\ndirection and present their results obtained during the n2c2 challenge on\ncohort selection for clinical trials.

This silver\nstandard is then used to train a traditional supervised model. The second\nmethod is a terminology-based approach where a medical expert selects the\nappropriate concepts, and a procedure is defined to search the terms and check\nthe structural or temporal constraints. Results: On the n2c2 dataset containing\nannotated data about 13 selection criteria on 288 patients, we obtained an\noverall F1-measure of 0.8969, which is the third best result out of 45\nparticipant teams, with no statistically significant difference with the\nbest-ranked team. Discussion: Both approaches obtained very encouraging results\nand apply to different types of criteria. The weakly supervised method requires\nexplicit descriptions of positive and negative examples in some reports. The\nterminology-based method is very efficient when medical concepts carry most of\nthe relevant information. Conclusion: It is unlikely that much more annotated\ndata will be soon available for the task of identifying a wide range of patient\nphenotypes. One must focus on weakly or non-supervised learning methods using\nboth structured and unstructured data and relying on a comprehensive\nrepresentation of the patients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 08:37:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 07:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

While experiments are fundamentally limited to the\nmaximum of three spatial dimensions, there is a growing interest in harnessing\nadditional synthetic dimensions. In our work, we introduce a new paradigm for\nthe experimental realization of excitation dynamics associated with\nmany-dimensional systems. Crucially, it relies solely on static one-dimensional\nequivalent structures with judiciously tailored parameters to faithfully\nreproduce the same optical spectrum and density of states of the\nhigh-dimensional system to be represented. In order to showcase the\ncapabilities of our approach, we fabricate 1D photonic lattices that exhibit\nthe characteristic non-monotonic excitation decays associated with quantum\nwalks in up to 7D square lattices. Furthermore, we find that a new type of\nbound state at the edge of the continuum emerges in higher-than-three\ndimensions and gives rise to a sharp localisation transition at defect sites.\nIn a series of experiments, we implement the mapped equivalent lattices of up\nto 5D systems and observe an extreme increase of sensitivity with respect to\nthe detuning of the respective anchor sites. Our findings demonstrate the\nfeasibility and applicative potential of harnessing high-dimensional effects in\nplanar photonics for ultra-sensitive switching or sensing.

Lightw.\nTechnol. 36, 3765 (2018)]. However, for the high-frequency and strong contrast\nproblems arising in photonics, the convergence of iterative solvers for the\nsolution of the linear system can be extremely slow. The uniform discretization\nof the volume integral operator leads to a three-level Toeplitz matrix, which\nis well suited to preconditioning via its circulant approximation. In this\npaper, we describe an effective circulant preconditioning strategy based on the\nmulti-level circulant preconditioner of Chan and Olkin [Numer. Algorithms 6, 89\n(1994)]. We show that this approach proves ideal in the canonical photonics\nproblem of propagation within a uniform waveguide, in which the flow is\nunidirectional. For more complex photonics structures, such as Bragg gratings,\ndirectional couplers, and disk resonators, we generalize our preconditioning\nstrategy via geometrical partitioning (leading to a block-diagonal circulant\npreconditioner) and homogenization (for inhomogeneous structures). Finally, we\nintroduce a novel memory reduction technique enabling the preconditioner's\nmemory footprint to remain manageable, even for extremely long structures. The\nrange of numerical results we present demonstrates that the preconditioned VIE\nis fast and has great utility for the numerical exploration of prototype\nphotonics devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 08:56:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

The approach is motivated by first showing that a lattice-based path\nplanner can be cast and analyzed as a bilevel optimization problem. This\ninformation is then used to tightly integrate a lattice-based path planner and\nnumerical optimal control in a novel way. The lattice-based path planner is\napplied to the problem in a first step using a discretized search space, where\nsystem dynamics and objective function are chosen to coincide with those used\nin a second numerical optimal control step. As a consequence, the lattice\nplanner provides the numerical optimal control step with a resolution optimal\nsolution to the problem, which is highly suitable as a warm-start to the second\nstep. This novel tight combination of a sampling-based path planner and\nnumerical optimal control makes, in a structured way, benefit of the former\nmethod's ability to solve combinatorial parts of the problem and the latter\nmethod's ability to obtain locally optimal solutions not constrained to a\ndiscretized search space.

Cellular networks are constantly evolving to meet the\ngrowing traffic demands. Over the past few years, wireless multicast has been\ngarnering a lot of attention as a means of efficient resource utilization.\nMulticast transmission lets spectral resources to be shared between users\nstreaming the same content. Even though multicast transmission allows to serve\nmultiple users on the same resources, in order to serve all these users\nsuccessfully, the base station cannot transmit the content at a rate greater\nthan that decodable by the user with the worst channel conditions. In this\npaper, we propose a way to overcome this bottleneck. Video streaming services\ncan sustain a certain amount of packet loss without any significant degradation\nin the quality experienced by the users. We leverage this loss tolerant nature\nof video streaming applications to improve the performance of multicast video\nservices in LTE and 5G.

In our approach, we\nvertically integrate the radial component of the momentum equation to obtain\nthe radial pressure gradient equation for a thin quasi-Keplerian accretion\ndisk. Our results show that, at large radial distance, the accretion disk\nbehaves in a Keplerian fashion. However, close to the neutron star, pressure\ngradient force (PGF) largely modifies the disk structure, resulting into sudden\ndynamical changes in the accretion disk. The corotation radius is shifted\ninward (outward) for $\\xi>1$ (for $\\xi<1$), and the position of the inner edge\nwith respect to the new corotation radius is also relocated accordingly, as\ncompared to the Keplerian model. The resulting PGF torque couples with viscous\ntorque (when $\\xi<1$) to provide a spin-down torque and a spin-up torque (when\n$\\xi>1$) while in the advective state. Therefore, neglecting the PGF, as has\nbeen the case in previous models, is a glaring omission.

In order to abstract from the details of measuring\ndistances, we define reciprocal best matches here as pairwise most closely\nrelated leaves in a gene tree, arguing that conceptually this is the notion\nthat is pragmatically approximated by distance- or similarity-based heuristics.\nWe start by showing that a graph $G$ is an RBMG if and only if its quotient\ngraph w.r.t.\\ a certain thinness relation is an RBMG. Furthermore, it is\nnecessary and sufficient that all connected components of $G$ are RBMGs. The\nmain result of this contribution is a complete characterization of RBMGs with 3\ncolors/species that can be checked in polynomial time. For 3 colors, there are\nthree distinct classes of trees that are related to the structure of the\nphylogenetic trees explaining them. We derive an approach to recognize RBMGs\nwith an arbitrary number of colors; it remains open however, whether a\npolynomial-time for RBMG recognition exists.

In this paper,\nwe study the Hall effect in a system of interacting two-dimensional charged\nparticles in a ballistic regime. We demonstrated that the Hall electric field\nis caused by a change in the densities of particles due to the effect of\nexternal fields on their free motions between the sample edges. In\none-component (electron or hole) systems the Hall coefficient turns out to one\nhalf compared with the one in conventional disordered Ohmic samples. This\nresult is consistent with the recent experiment on measuring of the Hall\nresistance in ultra-high-mobility GaAs quantum wells. In two-component\nelectron-hole systems the Hall electric field depends linearly on the\ndifference between the concentrations of electrons and holes near the charge\nneutrality point (the equilibrium electron and hole densities coincide) and\nsaturates to the Hall field of a one-component system far from the charge\nneutrality point. We also studied the corrections to magnetoresistance and the\nHall electric field due to inter-particle scattering being a precursor of\nforming a viscous flow. For the samples shorter than the inter-particle\nscattering length, the obtained corrections govern the dependencies of\nmagnetoresistance and the Hall field on temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 10:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

Moreover,\nby varying the inter-cavity distance we observe windows of reversion of the\nemission directionality and super-directionality that can be interesting for\napplications. We introduce a generalized array factor model that takes the\ncoupling into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 11:02:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 10:41:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

Coherent noise\ncancellation using Wiener filters provides a way to mitigate Newtonian noise.\nSo far, only the cancellation of Newtonian noise produced by seismic surface\nwaves has been studied in detail due to its relevance for Advanced LIGO and\nVirgo.

The situation has led to controversial results as to\nthe nature of the pairing symmetry of cuprates: while in-plane junction\nexperiments generally support $d$-wave pairing symmetry, those based on\nout-of-plane ($c$-axis) Josephson junctions between two rotated cuprate blocks\nfavor $s$-wave pairing. In this work, we revisit the $c$-axis experiment by\nfabricating Josephson junctions with atomic-level control in their interface\nstructure.

This is one of the very fundamental problems in\nrange searching with a long history. Previously, Andrew Yao's influential\nresult had shown that the problem is already non-trivial in one\ndimension~\\cite{Yao-1Dlb}: using $m$ units of space, the query time $Q(n)$ must\nbe $\\Omega( \\alpha(m,n) + \\frac{n}{m-n+1})$ where $\\alpha(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is the\ninverse Ackermann's function, a very slowly growing function.\n  In $d$ dimensions, Bernard Chazelle~\\cite{Chazelle.LB.II} proved that the\nquery time must be $Q(n) = \\Omega( (\\log_\\beta n)^{d-1})$ where $\\beta = 2m/n$.\nChazelle's lower bound is known to be tight for when space consumption is\n`high' i.e., $m = \\Omega(n \\log^{d+\\varepsilon}n)$. We have two main results.\nThe first is a lower bound that shows Chazelle's lower bound was not tight for\n`low space': we prove that we must have $m (n) = \\Omega(n (\\log n \\log\\log\nn)^{d-1})$. Our lower bound does not close the gap to the existing data\nstructures, however, our second result is that our analysis is tight. Thus, we\nbelieve the gap is in fact natural since lower bounds are proven for idempotent\nsemigroups while the data structures are built for general semigroups and thus\nthey cannot assume (and use) the properties of an idempotent semigroup. As a\nresult, we believe to close the gap one must study lower bounds for\nnon-idempotent semigroups or building data structures for idempotent\nsemigroups. We develope significantly new ideas for both of our results that\ncould be useful in pursuing either of these directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 12:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

In particular, we propose\nand analyze inexact randomized iterative methods for solving three closely\nrelated problems: a convex stochastic quadratic optimization problem, a best\napproximation problem and its dual, a concave quadratic maximization problem.\nWe provide iteration complexity results under several assumptions on the\ninexactness error. Inexact variants of many popular and some more exotic\nmethods, including randomized block Kaczmarz, randomized Gaussian Kaczmarz and\nrandomized block coordinate descent, can be cast as special cases.

The goal is to store them\nin a structure such that given a query range and an integer $k$, we can extract\n$k$ independent random samples from the points inside the query range, where\nthe probability of sampling a point is proportional to its weight.\n  This line of work was initiated in 2014 by Hu, Qiao, and Tao and it was later\nfollowed up by Afshani and Wei. The first line of work mostly studied\nunweighted but dynamic version of the problem in one dimension whereas the\nsecond result considered the static weighted problem in one dimension as well\nas the unweighted problem in 3D for halfspace queries.\n  We offer three main results and some interesting insights that were missed by\nthe previous work: We show that it is possible to build efficient data\nstructures for range sampling queries if we allow the query time to hold in\nexpectation (the first result), or obtain efficient worst-case query bounds by\nallowing the sampling probability to be approximately proportional to the\nweight (the second result). The third result is a conditional lower bound that\nshows essentially one of the previous two concessions is needed. For instance,\nfor the 3D range sampling queries, the first two results give efficient data\nstructures with near-linear space and polylogarithmic query time whereas the\nlower bound shows with near-linear space the worst-case query time must be\nclose to $n^{2/3}$, ignoring polylogarithmic factors.

However, analogous to mechanistic epidemic models, the growth rate\ncan be defined as a function of two parameters: the basic reproduction number\n(the average number of cells each infected cell infects) and the mean\ngeneration time (the average length of a replication cycle). Using a\nmechanistic model, previously published data from experiments in human lung\ncells, and newly generated data, we compared estimates of all three parameters\nfor six influenza A strains. Using previously published data, we found that the\ntwo human-adapted strains (pre-2009 seasonal H1N1, and pandemic H1N1) had a\nlower basic reproduction number, shorter mean generation time and slower growth\nrate than the two avian-adapted strains (H5N1 and H7N9). These same differences\nwere then observed in data from new experiments where two strains were\nengineered to have different internal proteins (pandemic H1N1 and H5N1), but\nthe same surface proteins (PR8), confirming our initial findings and implying\nthat differences between strains were driven by internal genes. Also, the model\npredicted that the human-adapted strains underwent more replication cycles than\nthe avian-adapted strains by the time of peak viral load, potentially\naccumulating mutations more quickly. These results suggest that the in vitro\nreproduction number, generation time and growth rate differ between\nhuman-adapted and avian-adapted influenza strains, and thus could be used to\nassess host adaptation of internal proteins to inform pandemic risk assessment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 15:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-26"}

These operators arise in many\nfields of physics, and our particular application is for kinetic plasma\nsimulations. In particular, we focus on an operator often known as the\n`Lenard-Bernstein,' or `Dougherty,' operator. Several novel algorithmic\ninnovations are reported. The concept of weak-equality is introduced and used\nto define weak-operators to compute primitive moments needed in the updates.\nWeak-equality is also used to determine a reconstruction procedure that allows\nan efficient and accurate discretization of the diffusion term. We show that\nwhen two integration by parts are used to construct the discrete weak-form, and\nfinite velocity-space extents are accounted for, a scheme that conserves\ndensity, momentum and energy exactly is obtained. One novel feature is that the\nrequirements of momentum and energy conservation lead to unique formulas to\ncompute primitive moments. Careful definition of discretized moments also\nensure that energy is conserved in the piecewise linear case, even though the\n$v^2$ term is not included in the basis-set used in the discretization. A\nseries of benchmark problems are presented and show that the scheme conserves\nmomentum and energy to machine precision. Empirical evidence also indicates\nthat entropy is a non-decreasing function. The collision terms are combined\nwith the Vlasov equation to study collisional Landau damping and plasma heating\nvia magnetic pumping. We conclude with an outline of future work, in particular\nwith some indications of how the algorithms presented here can be extended to\nuse the Rosenbluth potentials to compute the drag and diffusion coefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 15:44:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

In the\nconsidered model, each base station (BS) divides the messages that must be\ntransmitted to its users into a `private' part and a `common' part. Here, the\ncommon message is a message that all users want to receive and the private\nmessage is a message that is dedicated to only a specific user. The RSMA\nmechanism enables a BS to adjust the split of common and private messages so as\nto control the interference by decoding and treating interference as noise and,\nthus optimizing the data rate of users. To maximize the users' sum-rate, the\nnetwork can determine the rate allocation for the common message to meet the\nrate demand, and adjust the transmit power for the private message to reduce\nthe interference. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose\ngoal is to maximize the sum-rate of all users. To solve this nonconvex\nmaximization problem, the optimal power used for transmitting the private\nmessage to the users is first obtained in closed form for a given rate\nallocation and common message power. Based on the optimal private message\ntransmission power, the optimal rate allocation is then derived under a fixed\ncommon message transmission power. Subsequently, a one-dimensional search\nalgorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution of common message\ntransmission power. Simulation results show that the RSMA can achieve up to\n15.6\\% and 21.5\\% gains in terms of data rate compared to non-orthogonal\nmultiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access\n(OFDMA), respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 15:50:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

Our approach is based\non the well accepted minimum mean squared error with parallel interference\ncancellation (MMSE-PIC), where we derive an approximated equalizer whose\ncomplexity is reduced to two fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) per iteration. The\nFER results reveal that i) the proposed low-complexity receiver perform as good\nas the original MMSE-PIC, ii) OCDM performs very closely to PFE, and iii) OCDM\nhas approximately 2.5 dB improvement over OFDM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 15:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

To address these\nlimitations, we build SAQL, a novel stream-based query system that takes as\ninput, a real-time event feed aggregated from multiple hosts in an enterprise,\nand provides an anomaly query engine that queries the event feed to identify\nabnormal behaviors based on the specified anomaly models. SAQL provides a\ndomain-specific query language, Stream-based Anomaly Query Language (SAQL),\nthat uniquely integrates critical primitives for expressing major types of\nanomaly models. In the demo, we aim to show the complete usage scenario of SAQL\nby (1) performing an APT attack in a controlled environment, and (2) using SAQL\nto detect the abnormal behaviors in real time by querying the collected stream\nof system monitoring data that contains the attack traces. The audience will\nhave the option to interact with the system and detect the attack footprints in\nreal time via issuing queries and checking the query results through a\ncommand-line UI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 15:34:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 05:54:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-02"}

Then, based on this new\nprototype model, a dynamo action model explaining the generation of the\nmagnetic fields for A, Ap and Am type stars will be derived. We argue that\ntheir magnetic behavior is essentially due to locally exotic plasma properties\nleading to large scale charge separation in their interior. Their powerful\nmagnetic fields are generated by the revolution speed of these excess positive\nor negative charges tightly associated with the formation of one or two so\ncalled Torus structures. The lifespan of the Torus charge defines the stellar\nactivity cycle. In the solar case, two Torus structures are formed preserving\ntheir charge for 11 years. The Torus charging results from two processes:\nFirst, the stellar differential rotation with its shear layers and second, the\nlocal plasma property that the plasma rotational speed (U) is equal or greater\nthan the local light speed (v) in the medium. If U is greater than v, then two\nnearby pocket charges (initially formed by the stellar differential rotation)\nwill be mutually attracted. That is, the attractive magnetic force will be\ngreater than the repulsive electric one. In addition, the same poloidal field,\nin the subphotosphere shear layer, produces an excess charge generating the\nstarspot activity. The solar birthplace of Torus, within the tachocline, is\npositioned at 45 deg. latitudes. Each Torus drifts equatorward increasing\nsteadily its own rotational speed and, consequently, its own strength of\npoloidal magnetic field. A single Torus, over the equatorial plane, is probably\nformed in the interior of an Ap type star producing its strong and global\ndipole like magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 20:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-21"}

Application components can be\nimplemented as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and their execution sequences\ncan be modeled by a combination of sub-structures like sequence, parallel,\nselection, and loops. Efficient placement algorithms are required to map the\napplication components onto the infrastructure nodes. Current solutions do not\nconsider the mobility of fog nodes, a phenomenon which may happen in real\nsystems. In this paper, we use the random waypoint mobility model for fog nodes\nto calculate the expected makespan and application execution cost. We then\nmodel the problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation which\nminimizes an aggregated weighted function of the makespan and cost. We propose\na Tabu Search-based Component Placement (TSCP) algorithm to find sub-optimal\nplacements. The results show that the proposed algorithm improves the makespan\nand the application execution cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 13:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

In this paper, a new waveguide\nintegrated nanocavity plasmon laser is proposed for 1550 nm free-space\nwavelength. Due to its significant field confinement resulted by the metal\nstrip structure and strong interaction of plasmonic modes with the germanium\nquantum wells and as a result a considerable Purcell factor about 291, this\nstructure has a remarkable output performance. Using semi-classical rate\nequations in combination with finite difference time domain (FDTD) cavity mode\nanalysis, the output performance measures are estimated and confirmed with\nrespect to various physical models and simulation tools. Simulation results for\nthis tiny structure (0.073 um2 area) show a 2.8uW output power with 10uA\ninjection current and about 4.16mW output power with the threshold pump current\nof 27mA while maintaining its performance in a wide modulation bandwidth of\n178GHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 08:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

Torsion springs are usually exploited with an inner rod as a\nguide. The required space between the spring and the rod make the spring\ntilted. Unfortunately, as far as we are aware, no industrial software is able\nto determine the initial system angle made by the spring in its tilted\nposition. All the torque/angle curves are presented with relative angles. It\nmeans that whatever the number of coils considered, the angle is null when the\ntorque is null. For that reason, we have developed a methodology using both\nCATIA and ABAQUS to determine the system angle at the beginning of the\nbehavior. The model exploits wires designed with CATIA and imported in ABAQUS\nfor the center rod, the torsion spring and the rods of the system to apply the\ntorque. Several options to model contact between the several parts have been\ninvestigated. They mostly use connector with an axial property and a stop\ncriterion. The obtained results are very interesting and enable to plan further\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 15:48:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-11"}

However, adversarial machine learning has similarly advanced\nand has been used to demonstrate that VPSes are vulnerable to the injection of\nhidden commands - audio obscured by noise that is correctly recognized by a VPS\nbut not by human beings. Such attacks, though, are often highly dependent on\nwhite-box knowledge of a specific machine learning model and limited to\nspecific microphones and speakers, making their use across different acoustic\nhardware platforms (and thus their practicality) limited. In this paper, we\nbreak these dependencies and make hidden command attacks more practical through\nmodel-agnostic (blackbox) attacks, which exploit knowledge of the signal\nprocessing algorithms commonly used by VPSes to generate the data fed into\nmachine learning systems. Specifically, we exploit the fact that multiple\nsource audio samples have similar feature vectors when transformed by acoustic\nfeature extraction algorithms (e.g., FFTs). We develop four classes of\nperturbations that create unintelligible audio and test them against 12 machine\nlearning models, including 7 proprietary models (e.g., Google Speech API, Bing\nSpeech API, IBM Speech API, Azure Speaker API, etc), and demonstrate successful\nattacks against all targets. Moreover, we successfully use our maliciously\ngenerated audio samples in multiple hardware configurations, demonstrating\neffectiveness across both models and real systems. In so doing, we demonstrate\nthat domain-specific knowledge of audio signal processing represents a\npractical means of generating successful hidden voice command attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 2019 20:10:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-12"}
