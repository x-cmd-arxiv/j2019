For systems with\nindividual repairable components, each failed component can be replaced at any\ninspection time and other components continue functioning, so the age of each\ncomponent at any inspection time is different from other components. Different\ninitial ages have an effect on the optimal time that the whole system should be\ninspected, therefore the optimal inspection time should be calculated\ndynamically considering the age of each component at the beginning of the\ninterval.

Experimental evidence suggests that such rotor proteins, like the ATP\nsynthases of the inner mitochondrial membrane, can arrange themselves into\nlattices. We show that crystallization is possible through a combination of\nhydrodynamic and repulsive interactions between the rotor proteins. In\nparticular, hydrodynamic interactions induce rotational motion of the rotor\nprotein assembly that, in the presence of repulsion, drives the system into a\nhexagonal lattice. The entire crystal rotates with an angular velocity which\nincreases with motor density and decreases with lattice diameter - larger and\nsparser arrays rotate at a slower pace. The rotational interactions allow\nensembles of proteins to sample configurations and reach an ordered steady\nstate, which are inaccessible to the quenched nonrotational system. Rotational\ninteractions thus act as a sort of temperature that removes disorder, except\nthat actual thermal diffusion leads to expansion and loss of order. In\ncontrast, the rotational interactions are bounded in space. Hence, once an\nordered state is reached, it is maintained at all times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Mar 2019 16:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-09"}

Using nonmodal\nstability theory, we demonstrate that both the onset of linear instabilities\nand the shape of optimal perturbations are highly sensitive to perturbation\namplification measures and also the time at which the boundary layer is\nperturbed. This behavior is in contrast to traditional studies of steady or\nnon-transient diffusive boundary layers where perturbation dynamics are\nindependent of perturbation measure or time. We demonstrate that any analysis\nof transient layers produced through classical methods can result in physically\nunrealizable perturbation structures. To resolve the issue, we propose a\nnonmodal stability procedure which additionally constrains the perturbation\ndynamics to physically admissible fields. The proposed procedure predicts that\ninstabilities grow primarily due to unstable perturbations featuring much\nlarger spanwise wavenumbers (modes) and smaller amplifications compared to\nperturbations predicted using classical methods. We validate our predictions\nusing direct numerical simulations that emulate the onset of convection in\nphysical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Mar 2019 17:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

For such games, simple no-regret learning\nalgorithms exist in several cases and ensure convergence to coarse correlated\nequilibria (CCE). The efficiency of such equilibria with respect to a social\nfunction, however, is not well understood. In this paper, we define the class\nof valid utility games with continuous strategies and provide efficiency bounds\nfor their CCEs. Our bounds rely on the social function being a monotone\nDR-submodular function. We further refine our bounds based on the curvature of\nthe social function. Furthermore, we extend our efficiency bounds to a class of\nnon-submodular functions that satisfy approximate submodularity properties.\nFinally, we show that valid utility games with continuous strategies can be\ndesigned to maximize monotone DR-submodular functions subject to disjoint\nconstraints with approximation guarantees. The approximation guarantees we\nderive are based on the efficiency of the equilibria of such games and can\nimprove the existing ones in the literature.

It arises from the physics of supernova bubbles,\ninsensitive to the microscopic SFR recipe and not explicitly dependent on\ngravity. The key is that the filling factor of SFR-suppressed supernova bubbles\nself-regulates to a constant, $f\\sim 0.5$. Expressing the bubble fading radius\nand time in terms of $n$, the filling factor is $f \\propto S\\,n^{-s}$ with\n$s\\sim 1.5$, where $S$ is the supernova rate density.

The\nhomogeneous cooling state of a freely cooling granular gas is investigated with\nthe system of the Grad (d+3)(d^2+6d+2)/6-moment equations and its various\nsubsystems. By performing a linear stability analysis in the vicinity of the\nhomogeneous cooling state, the critical system size for the onset of\ninstability is estimated through the considered Grad moment systems. The\nresults on critical system size from the presented moment theories are found to\nbe in reasonably good agreement with those from simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Mar 2019 19:07:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2020 19:41:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 19 Jan 2020 05:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-07"}

The current work\nproposes a complete pipeline for solving packing tasks for cuboid objects,\ngiven access only to RGB-D data and a single robot arm with a vacuum-based\nend-effector, which is also used as a pushing or dragging finger. The pipeline\nintegrates perception for detecting the objects and planning so as to properly\npick and place objects. The key challenges correspond to sensing noise and\nfailures in execution, which appear at multiple steps of the process. To\nachieve robustness, three uncertainty-reducing manipulation primitives are\nproposed, which take advantage of the end-effector's and the workspace's\ncompliance, to successfully and tightly pack multiple cuboid objects. The\noverall solution is demonstrated to be robust to execution and perception\nerrors. The impact of each manipulation primitive is evaluated in extensive\nreal-world experiments by considering different versions of the pipeline.\nFurthermore, an open-source simulation framework is provided for modeling such\npacking operations.

Quantitative cell tracking using compressed sensing\nTurboSPI-based R2* mapping is a promising development to improve accuracy in\nlongitudinal studies on immune recruitment. The phase-encoded TurboSPI sequence\nprovides high fidelity relaxation data in the form of signal time-courses with\nhigh temporal resolution. However, early in vivo applications of this method\nrevealed that simple mono-exponential R2* fitting performs poorly due to the\ncontaminant fat signal in voxels surrounding regions of interest, such as flank\ntumors and lymph nodes adjacent to adipose tissue. This is especially\nproblematic if there is poor infiltration to the tumor such that immune cells\nremain near the periphery. The presence of an off-resonance fat isochromat\nresults in modulations in the signal time-course can be erroneously fit as R2*\nsignal decay, thereby overestimating the density of SPIO labeled cells. Simply\nexcluding any voxel with fat-typical modulations results in underestimates in\nvoxels that have mixed content. We propose using a more comprehensive\ndual-decay (R2f* and R2w*) Dixon-based signal model that accounts for the\npotential presence of fat in a voxel to better estimate SPIO induced\nde-phasing. In silico single voxel simulations illustrate how the proposed\nsignal model provides stable R2w* estimates that are invariant to fat content.\nThe proposed dual-decay model outperforms previous methods when applied to in\nvitro samples of SPIO labeled cells and oil prepared with oil content >15%.\nPreliminary in vivo results show that, compared to previous methods, the\ndual-decay Dixon model improves the balance of R2* specificity versus\nsensitivity, which in turn will result in more reliable analysis in future cell\ntracking studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 01:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

It is\nsurprising that this problem remains open, even as massive artificial neural\nnetworks are being trained on increasingly low-cost and unreliable processing\nunits. Our coding-theory-inspired strategy, \"CodeNet,\" solves this problem by\naddressing three challenges in the science of reliable computing: (i) Providing\nthe first strategy for error-resilient neural network training by encoding each\nlayer separately; (ii) Keeping the overheads of coding\n(encoding/error-detection/decoding) low by obviating the need to re-encode the\nupdated parameter matrices after each iteration from scratch. (iii) Providing a\ncompletely decentralized implementation with no central node (which is a single\npoint of failure), allowing all primary computational steps to be error-prone.\nWe theoretically demonstrate that CodeNet has higher error tolerance than\nreplication, which we leverage to speed up computation time. Simultaneously,\nCodeNet requires lower redundancy than replication, and equal computational and\ncommunication costs in scaling sense. We first demonstrate the benefits of\nCodeNet in reducing expected computation time over replication when accounting\nfor checkpointing. Our experiments show that CodeNet achieves the best\naccuracy-runtime tradeoff compared to both replication and uncoded strategies.\nCodeNet is a significant step towards biologically plausible neural network\ntraining, that could hold the key to orders of magnitude efficiency\nimprovements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 01:45:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

This catalog comprises 3420 flare stars and 162,262\nflare events. A comparison shows that the flare catalogs of previous studies\nare seriously polluted by various false positive signals and artifacts. The\nincidence of flare stars rises with decreasing temperature, which accords with\nthe theoretical analysis. The flare frequency distributions (FFDs) from F-type\nstars to M-type stars obey a power-law relation with $\\alpha \\sim 2$,\nindicating that they have the same mechanism on generating flares. The\nremarkable incidence and the deviation of FFDs on A-type flare stars imply that\nthey generate flares in a different way. The activity--rotation relation is\nconsistent with previous studies at low temperature band, whereas it becomes\ndispersive with increasing temperature. Combined with the Gyrochronology, we\nfind that the mixing of stars of two different dynamos gives rise to the\ndispersion. We thereby propose a scenario on understanding the\nactivity--rotation relation across the H-R diagram. Based on the scenario and\nthe correspondence of dynamo with regard to activity and rotation, we suggest a\nnew expression on the activity--rotation relation, in which the segmentation is\non the basis of the dynamo rather than the rotation period. The rotation\ndistribution of flare stars shows that about 70\\% of flare stars rotate faster\nthan 10 days and the rate approaches 95\\% at 30 days.

We analyze\nthe following three problems separately; first, we maximize the smallest\nnonzero eigenvalue, also known as the algebraic connectivity; secondly, we\nminimize the largest eigenvalue, also known as the spectral radius; and\nfinally, we minimize the spectral width. Maximizing the algebraic connectivity\nrequires identical weights on the interlayer edges for budgets less than a\nthreshold value. However, for larger budgets, the optimal weights are generally\nnon-uniform. The dual formulation transforms the problem into a graph\nrealization (embedding) problem that allows us to give a fuller picture.\nNamely, before the threshold budget, the optimal realization is one-dimensional\nwith nodes in the same layer embedded to a single point; while, beyond the\nthreshold, the optimal embeddings generally unfold into spaces with dimension\nbounded by the multiplicity of the algebraic connectivity. Finally, for\nextremely large budgets the embeddings revert again to lower dimensions.\nMinimizing the largest eigenvalue is driven by the spectral radius of the\nindividual networks and its corresponding eigenvector. Before a threshold, the\ntotal budget is distributed among interlayer edges corresponding to the nodal\nlines of this eigenvector, and the optimal largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian\nremains constant. For larger budgets, the weight distribution tends to be\nalmost uniform. In the dual picture, the optimal graph embedding is\none-dimensional and non-homogeneous at first and beyond this threshold, the\noptimal embedding expands to be multi-dimensional, and for larger values of the\nbudget, the two layers fill the embedding space.

The estimated depth provides additional information\ncomplementary to individual semantic features, which can be helpful for other\nvision tasks such as tracking, recognition and detection. However, there are\nlarge appearance variations between images from different spectral bands, which\nis a challenge for cross-spectral stereo matching. Existing deep unsupervised\nstereo matching methods are sensitive to the appearance variations and do not\nperform well on cross-spectral data. We propose a novel unsupervised\ncross-spectral stereo matching framework based on image-to-image translation.\nFirst, a style adaptation network transforms images across different spectral\nbands by cycle consistency and adversarial learning, during which appearance\nvariations are minimized. Then, a stereo matching network is trained with image\npairs from the same spectra using view reconstruction loss. At last, the\nestimated disparity is utilized to supervise the spectral-translation network\nin an end-to-end way. Moreover, a novel style adaptation network F-cycleGAN is\nproposed to improve the robustness of spectral translation.

A robust and\nversatile method to model the dominating instrumental background (BG) radiation\nis difficult to establish for such a telescope in the rapidly changing space\nenvironment. From long-term monitoring of SPI's Germanium detectors, we built\nup a spectral parameter data base, which characterises the instrument response\nas well as the BG behaviour. We aim to build a self-consistent and broadly\napplicable BG model for typical science cases of INTEGRAL/SPI, based on this\ndata base. The general analysis method for SPI relies on distinguishing between\nillumination patterns on the 19-element Germanium detector array from BG and\nsky in a maximum likelihood framework. We illustrate how the complete set of\nmeasurements, even including the exposures of the sources of interest, can be\nused to define a BG model. We apply our method to different science cases,\nincluding point-like, diffuse, continuum, and line emission, and evaluate the\nadequacy in each case. From likelihood values and the number of fitted\nparameters, we determine how strong the impact of the unknown BG variability\nis. We find that the number of fitted parameters, i.e. how often the BG has to\nbe re-normalised, depends on the emission type (diffuse with many observations\nover a large sky region, or point-like with concentrated exposure around one\nsource), and the spectral energy range and bandwidth. A unique time scale,\nvalid for all analysis issues, is not applicable for INTEGRAL/SPI, but must and\ncan be inferred from the chosen data set. We conclude that our BG modelling\nmethod is usable in a large variety of INTEGRAL/SPI science cases, and provides\nnearly systematics-free and robust results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 07:09:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

After\na release of energy, these loops undergo a heating and upflow phase, followed\nby a cooling and downflow cycle. Throughout, there are significant variations\nin the properties of the coronal plasma. In particular, the increased coronal\ntemperature leads to an excess downward heat flux that the transition region is\nunable to radiate. This generates an enthalpy flux from the transition region\nto the corona, increasing the coronal density. The enthalpy exchange is highly\nsensitive to the transition region resolution in numerical simulations. With a\nnumerically under-resolved transition region, major errors occur in simulating\nthe coronal density evolution and, thus, the predicted loop emission. This\nLetter presents a new method that addresses the difficulty of obtaining the\ncorrect interaction between the corona and corona/chromosphere interface. In\nthe transition region, an adaptive thermal conduction approach is used that\nbroadens any unresolved parts of the atmosphere.

Hence, a lot\nof research is currently being done for reducing such bilinear dynamical\nsystems (termed as bilinear model order reduction or bilinear MOR). Bilinear\niterative rational Krylov algorithm (BIRKA) is a very popular, standard and\nmathematically sound algorithm for bilinear MOR, which is based upon\ninterpolatory projection technique. An efficient variant of BIRKA, Truncated\nBIRKA (or TBIRKA) has also been recently proposed.\n  Like for any MOR algorithm, these two algorithms also require solving\nmultiple linear systems as part of the model reduction process. For reducing\nvery large dynamical systems, which is now-a-days becoming a norm, scaling of\nsuch linear systems with respect to input dynamical system size is a\nbottleneck. For efficiency, these linear systems are often solved by an\niterative solver, which introduces approximation errors.

Such\nhybrid structure features fundamentally distinct electron-hole excitations and\nresulting effective superconducting subgap. Studying the particle-hole and\ntime-reversal symmetry properties of the mixed state Dirac-Bogoliubov-de Gennes\neffective Hamiltonian gives rise to manifesting possible topological phase\nexchange of surface states, since the mixed-spin channels leads to appearance\nof a band gap on the surface states. This is verified by determining\ntopological invariant winding number for chiral eigenstates, which is achieved\nby introducing a chiral symmetry operator. We interestingly find the role of\nmixed superconducting state as creating a mass-like gap in topological\ninsulator by means of introducing new mixed-spin channels $\\Delta_1$ and\n$\\Delta_2$. The interplay between superconducting spin-singlet and triplet\ncorrelations actually results in gaped surface states, where the size of gap\ncan be controlled by tuning the relative $s$ and $p$-waves pairing potentials.\nWe show that the system is in different topology classes by means of chiral and\nno-chiral spin-triplet symmetry. In addition, the resulting effective\nsuperconductor subgap manipulated at the Fermi surface presents a complicated\ndependency on mixed-spin channels. Furthermore, we investigate the resulting\nsubgap tunneling conductance in N/S and Josephson current in S/I/S junctions to\nunveil the influence of effective symmetry of mixed superconducting gap. The\nresults can pave the way to realize the effective superconducting gap in\nnoncentrosymmetric superconductors with mixed-spin state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 09:09:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Mar 2019 09:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

Network theory\noffers the opportunity to use a mathematical formalism to model both the esteem\nassociated with an academic and the relationships between academic colleagues.\nEarly attempts using this line of reasoning have focused on intellectual\ngenealogy as constituted by supervisor student networks. The process of\nexamination is critical in many areas of study but has not played a part in\nexisting models. A network theoretical \"social\" model is proposed as a tool to\nexplore and understand the dynamics of esteem in the academic hierarchy. It is\nobserved that such a model naturally gives rise to the idea that the esteem\nassociated with a node in the graph (the esteem of an individual academic) can\nbe viewed as a dynamic quantity that evolves with time based on both local and\nnon-local changes in the properties in the network. The toy model studied here\nincludes both supervisor-student and examiner-student relationships. This gives\nan insight into some of the key features of academic genealogies and naturally\nleads to a proposed model for \"esteem propagation\" on academic networks. This\npropagation is not solely directed forward in time (from teacher to progeny)\nbut sometimes also flows in the other direction. As collaborators do well, this\nreflects well on those with whom they choose to collaborate and those that\ntaught them. Furthermore, esteem as a quantity continues to be dynamic even\nafter the end of a relationship or career. In other words, esteem can be\nthought of as flowing both forward and backward in time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 09:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-19"}

We then consider the\ntraditional approach of scheduling jobs in a prioritized order based on the\nupward-rank of each job. For those jobs with no precedence constraints among\nthemselves, the plain upward-rank priority scheme assigns priorities in an\narbitrary way. We propose a job prioritization scheme that uses Markovian chain\nstationary probabilities as a measure of importance of jobs. The scheme keeps\nthe precedence order for the jobs that have precedence constraints between each\nother, and assigns priorities according to the jobs' importance for the jobs\nwithout precedence constraints. We finally design a uniform spare budget\nsplitting strategy, which splits the spare budget uniformly across all the\njobs.

If the flow turns super-Alfv\\'enic, we show that\nparallel R/L-modes and perpendicular X/O-modes become unstable and grow in\namplitude. Within the linear theory, we find that the growth rate curve of an\nunstable mode has a maximum at some wavenumber specific to each mode. If we\nconsider a shock-like plasma configuration, we find that the fastest growing\nmode is the resonant one (with $k \\sim r_{gi}^{-1}$) which strongly interacts\nwith ions. In Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations, we observe that a resonant\nwave with the same properties is excited during the early phases of shock\nformation. Once the wave becomes non-linear, it efficiently scatters ions and\ntriggers the initial shock formation. This implies that the typical compression\nratio of $\\sim 4$ could naturally arise as a consequence of a highly resonant\nmicro-physical process. We model the interaction of ions reflected from the\nreforming shock barrier in a weak-beam case, and we show that the upstream wave\nnow matches the instability we expect from the equations. By using PIC\nsimulations, we explain how the strong-beam resonant instability triggers shock\nformation in the non-linear stage, and how the weak-beam instability reforms\nand transmits the shock afterwards. The micro-instabilities that we study here\ncould largely contribute to shock triggering as well as to the reformation and\ntransmission of the shock itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 10:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

Taking\ninto account all observations from the three dust instruments on-board Rosetta,\nwe favor an interpretation of our simulations based on two different families\nof dust particles with significantly distinct fractal dimensions ejected from\nthe cometary nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 12:28:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-25"}

Quantum speed limit is one of the interesting issue in the theory of\nopen quantum systems. One may investigate the influence of the relativistic\neffect on the quantum speed limit time. When several observers are placed in\ndifferent inertial or non-inertial frames, or in Schwarzschild space-time, the\nrelativistic effect should be taken into account. In this work, the quantum\nspeed limit time in Schwarzschild space-time will be studied for two various\nmodel consist of damped Jaynes-Cummings and Ohmic-like dephasing. First, it\nwill be observed that how quantum coherence is affected by Hawking radiation.\nAccording to the dependence of quantum speed limit time on quantum coherence\nand the dependence of quantum coherence on relative distance of quantum system\nto event horizon $R_{0}$, it will be represented that the quantum speed limit\ntime in Schwarzschild space-time is decreased by increasing $R_{0}$ for damped\nJaynes-Cummings model and conversely, It is increased by increasing $R_{0}$ for\nOhmic-like dephasing model .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 13:38:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 11:57:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

Observations show that sulfur\nremains relatively non-depleted with respect to its cosmic value throughout the\ndiffuse and translucent stages of an interstellar molecular cloud, but its\ngas-phase constituents cannot account for this cosmic value towards\nhigher-density environments. We have attempted to address this issue by\nmodeling the evolution of an interstellar cloud from its pristine state as a\ndiffuse atomic cloud to a molecular environment of much higher density, using a\ngas/grain astrochem. code and an enhanced sulfur reaction network. A common\ngas/grain reaction network has been systematically updated and greatly extended\nbased on previous lit. and models, with a focus on the grain chemistry and\nprocesses. A simple model was used to benchmark the resulting network updates,\nand the results of the model were compared to typical astronomical observations\nsourced from the literature. Our new gas/grain model is able to reproduce the\nelemental depletion of sulfur, whereby sulfur can be depleted from the\ngas-phase by two orders of magnitude, and this process may occur under dark\ncloud conditions if the cloud has a chemical age of at least 1 Myrs. The\nresulting mix of sulfur-bearing species on the grain ranges across all the most\ncommon chemical elements (H/C/N/O), not dissimilar to the molecules observed in\ncometary environments. Notably, this mixture is not dominated simply by H2S,\nunlike all other current astrochem. models. Despite our relatively simple\nphysical model, most of the known gas-phase S-bearing molecular abundances are\naccurately reproduced under dense conditions, however they are not expected to\nbe the primary molecular sinks of sulfur. Our model predicts that most of the\nmissing sulfur is in the form of organo-sulfur species trapped on grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 13:39:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 08:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

Driven by the emerging magnetic\nflux, the emerged positive fluxes moved toward and cancelled with its nearby\nnegative fluxes, where the negative ends of a filament channel beneath the\nfilament and a bundle of left-skewed coronal loops overlying the filament were\nanchored. Complemented by the nonlinear force-free field extrapolation, we find\nthat the coronal magnetic field lines associated with the filament channel and\nthe emerging magnetic fields consist of sheared field lines. Prior to the\nfilament eruption, unambiguous observational evidence indicates that multiple\ninteractions occurred between the emerging magnetic fields and the left-skewed\ncoronal loops, implying a tether-weakening reconnection. Specifically, during\nthe final episode of the tether-weakening reconnection, a remarkable sigmoid\nstructure was formed and lifted up together with the filament. Accordingly, we\nspeculate that the tether-weakening reconnection probably destabilized the\nfilament system and triggered its rise. Subsequently, the filament and the\nsigmoid structure erupted together and produced a CME. After the eruption, the\nemerging magnetic fields continued to reconnect with the remaining filament\nchannel, leading to the reformation of the filament. This observation strongly\nsupports the idea that emerging magnetic flux plays an important role in\ntriggering the filament to erupt, and the filament is reformed by magnetic\nreconnection between the emerging magnetic fields and its nearby filament\nchannel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 13:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

In particular, methods based on\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art\nsegmentation performance. However, CNNs usually require a decent amount of\nannotated data, which may be costly and time-consuming to obtain. Since\nunannotated data is generally abundant, it is desirable to use unannotated data\nto improve the segmentation performance for CNNs when limited annotated data is\navailable. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach\nto brain lesion segmentation, where unannotated data is incorporated into the\ntraining of CNNs. We adapt the mean teacher model, which is originally\ndeveloped for SSL-based image classification, for brain lesion segmentation.\nAssuming that the network should produce consistent outputs for similar inputs,\na loss of segmentation consistency is designed and integrated into a\nself-ensembling framework. Specifically, we build a student model and a teacher\nmodel, which share the same CNN architecture for segmentation. The student and\nteacher models are updated alternately. At each step, the student model learns\nfrom the teacher model by minimizing the weighted sum of the segmentation loss\ncomputed from annotated data and the segmentation consistency loss between the\nteacher and student models computed from unannotated data. Then, the teacher\nmodel is updated by combining the updated student model with the historical\ninformation of teacher models using an exponential moving average strategy. For\ndemonstration, the proposed approach was evaluated on ischemic stroke lesion\nsegmentation, where it improves stroke lesion segmentation with the\nincorporation of unannotated data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 14:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

On the other hand,\nLyman series photons, especially Ly~$\\beta$, are mostly absorbed by upstream\nhydrogen atoms. As a result, atoms are excited to the 3p state, and then emit\nH~$\\alpha$ by the spontaneous transition from 3p to 2s. Thus, the nature of\nH~$\\alpha$ depends on how many Ly~$\\beta$ photons are converted to H~$\\alpha$\nphotons. Moreover, the Balmer lines can be scattered by the 2s-state hydrogen\natoms, which are excited not only by collisional excitation but also by the\nLyman-Balmer conversion.

The core engine behind it is a combinatorial lemma of Robertson,\nSeymour and Thomas that states that every planar graph either has a\n$\\sqrt{k}\\times \\sqrt{k}$-grid as a minor, or its treewidth is $O(\\sqrt{k})$.\nHowever, bidimensionality theory cannot be extended directly to several\nwell-known classes of geometric graphs. Nevertheless, a relaxation of this\nlemma has been proven useful for unit disk graphs. Inspired by this, we prove a\nnew decomposition lemma for map graphs. Informally, our lemma states the\nfollowing. For any map graph $G$, there exists a collection $(U_1,\\ldots,U_t)$\nof cliques of $G$ with the following property: $G$ either contains a\n$\\sqrt{k}\\times \\sqrt{k}$-grid as a minor, or it admits a tree decomposition\nwhere every bag is the union of $O(\\sqrt{k})$ of the cliques in the above\ncollection.

Here we describe\ngeometric, dynamical, and total phases calculated along a closed spatial\ncontour in a multi-component complex field, with particular emphasis on 2D\n(paraxial) and 3D (nonparaxial) optical fields. We present several equivalent\napproaches: (i) an algebraic formalism, universal for any multi-component\nfield; (ii) a dynamical approach using the Coriolis coupling between the spin\nangular momentum and reference-frame rotations; and (iii) a geometric\nrepresentation, which unifies the Pancharatnam-Berry phase for the 2D\npolarization on the Poincar\\'e sphere and the Majorana-sphere representation\nfor the 3D polarized fields. Most importantly, we reveal close connections\nbetween geometric phases, angular-momentum properties of the field, and\ntopological properties of polarization singularities in 2D and 3D fields, such\nas C-points and polarization M\\\"obius strips.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 15:30:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2019 13:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

Interestingly, they found\nsome new emergent phenomena in the paradigm of Kuramoto model: clustering into\nsubgroups and emergence of global phase synchronization taking place at finite\ntime.\n  This paper aims at introducing the associated kinetic singular Kuramoto model\nalong $\\mathbb{T}\\times\\mathbb{R}$, that is reminiscent of the classical\nKuramoto-Sakaguchi equation. Our main goal is to propose a well-posedness\ntheory of measure-valued solutions that remains valid after eventual phase\ncollisions. The results will depend upon the specific regime of singularity:\nsubcritical, critical and supercritical. The cornerstone is the existence of\nFilippov characteristic flows for interaction kernels with jump\ndiscontinuities. Our second goal is to study stability with respect to initial\ndata, that in particular will provide quantitative estimates for the mean-field\nlimit of the agent-based model towards the kinetic equation in quadratic\nWasserstein-type distances. Finally, we will recover global phase\nsynchronization at the macroscopic scale under appropriate generic assumptions\non the initial data.

Compression quality for each frame is determined by optimizing\nthe trade-off between value and storage cost. With finite storage, prioritized\ndata recording discards low-value buffers to make room for new data. This paper\nformulates SBB compression decision making as a constrained multi-objective\noptimization problem with novel value metrics and filtering. The SBB has been\nevaluated on a traffic simulator which generates trajectories containing events\nof interest (EOIs) and corresponding first-person view videos. SBB compression\nefficiency is assessed by comparing storage requirements with different\ncompression quality levels and event capture ratios. Performance is evaluated\nby comparing results with a traditional first-in-first-out (FIFO) recording\nscheme.

The deep metric learning model is supervised by the\ncenter loss to produce spectrum-based features that gather more tightly in\nEuclidean space within classes. The conditional random field with Gaussian edge\npotentials, which is firstly proposed for image segmentation tasks, is\nintroduced to give the pixel-wise classification over the hyperspectral image\nby utilizing both the geographical distances between pixels and the Euclidean\ndistances between the features produced by the deep metric learning model. The\nproposed framework is trained by spectral pixels at the deep metric learning\nstage and utilizes the half handcrafted spatial features at the conditional\nrandom field stage. This settlement alleviates the shortage of training data to\nsome extent.

This model predicts that for STI values between 0.7 and 1, which\nmeans a speech signal close to 100% of intelligibility, the DP remains constant\nat about 7%. The experiment that we carried out aimed to gather more\ninformation about the relation between DP and STI, varying the STI value up to\n0.9. Fifty-five subjects between 25-59 years old participated in the\nexperiment. First, some psychological parameters were observed in order to\nbetter characterize the inter-subjects variability. Then, subjects performed a\nWorking-Memory (WM) task in silence and in four different sound conditions (STI\nfrom 0.25 to 0.9). This task was customized by an initial measure of mnemonic\nspan so that two different cognitive loads (low/high) were equally defined for\neach subject around their span value. Subjects also subjectively evaluated\ntheir mental load and discomfort at the end of each WM task, for each noise\ncondition. Results show a significant effect of the STI on the DP, the mental\nload and the discomfort. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found\nbetween the age of subjects and their performance during the WM task.
