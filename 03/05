The incommensurate magnetic ordering of a cycloid\nstructure was found to be stable below the reported critical pressure of 4.5\nGPa. In contrast, a commensurate E-type spin ordering of Mn spins and a\nnoncollinear configuration of Tb spins with k=(0,1/2,0) appeared above 4.5 GPa.\nThe application of a magnetic field along the a axis (H_{||a}) under pressure\ninduces a k=(0,0,0)antiferromagnetic structure in the case of Tb spins above\nH_{||a}, enhancing the ferroelectric polarization, while the E-type ordering of\nMn spins is stable even above the critical field. From the present experimental\nfindings, we conclude that the E-type ordering of Mn spins induces giant\nferroelectric polarization through an exchange striction mechanism.

Incomplete fat suppression\nalso generates artifacts, and may affect advanced motion correction methods.\nThe aim was to evaluate a recently reported lipid insensitive MRI method for\nself-navigated coronary MRA at 3T. Lipid insensitive binomial off resonant\nexcitation (LIBRE) radiofrequency (RF) excitation pulses were included into a\nself-navigated 3D radial GRE coronary MRA sequence at 3T.

One of the clinical\nmeasures that quantifies vessel changes is the arterio-venous ratio (AVR) which\nrepresents the ratio between artery and vein diameters. This measure\nsignificantly depends on the accuracy of vessel segmentation and classification\ninto arteries and veins. This paper proposes a fast, novel method for semantic\nA/V segmentation combining deep learning and graph propagation.\n  Methods A convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to jointly segment\nand classify vessels into arteries and veins. The initial CNN labeling is\npropagated through a graph representation of the retinal vasculature, whose\nnodes are defined as the vessel branches and edges are weighted by the cost of\nlinking pairs of branches. To efficiently propagate the labels, the graph is\nsimplified into its minimum spanning tree.\n  Results The method achieves an accuracy of 94.8% for vessels segmentation.\nThe A/V classification achieves a specificity of 92.9% with a sensitivity of\n93.7% on the CT-DRIVE database compared to the state-of-the-art-specificity and\nsensitivity, both of 91.7%.\n  Conclusion The results show that our method outperforms the leading previous\nworks on a public dataset for A/V classification and is by far the fastest.\n  Significance The proposed global AVR calculated on the whole fundus image\nusing our automatic A/V segmentation method can better track vessel changes\nassociated to diabetic retinopathy than the standard local AVR calculated only\naround the optic disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 16:17:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

To date, the\nmost widely-used entangled photon pairs are generated from spontaneous\nparametric downconversion, a process that is intrinsically probabilistic and\nthus relegated to a regime of low pair-generation rates. In contrast,\nsemiconductor quantum dots can generate triggered entangled photon pairs via a\ncascaded radiative decay process, and do not suffer from any fundamental\ntrade-off between source brightness and multi-pair generation. However, a\nsource featuring simultaneously high photon-extraction efficiency, high-degree\nof entanglement fidelity and photon indistinguishability has not yet been\nreported. Here, we present an entangled photon pair source with high brightness\nand indistinguishability by deterministically embedding GaAs quantum dots in\nbroadband photonic nanostructures that enable Purcell-enhanced emission. Our\nsource produces entangled photon pairs with a record pair collection\nprobability of up to 0.65(4) (single-photon extraction efficiency of 0.85(3)),\nentanglement fidelity of 0.88(2), and indistinguishabilities of 0.901(3) and\n0.903(3), which immediately creates opportunities for advancing quantum\nphotonic technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 16:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-26"}

In\nthis case, different subcarriers in an orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM) system will \"see\" distinct angles of arrival (AoAs) for the\nsame path. This effect is known as beam squint, resulting from the\nspatial-wideband effect, and makes the approaches based on the conventional\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) model, such as channel estimation and\nprecoding, inapplicable. After discussing the relationship between beam squint\nand the spatial-wideband effect, we propose a channel estimation scheme for\nfrequency-division duplex (FDD) mmWave massive MIMO-OFDM systems with hybrid\nanalog/digital precoding, which takes the beam squint effect into\nconsideration. A super-resolution compressed sensing approach is developed to\nextract the frequency-insensitive parameters of each uplink channel path, i.e.,\nthe AoA and the time delay, and the frequency-sensitive parameter, i.e., the\ncomplex channel gain. With the help of the reciprocity of these\nfrequency-insensitive parameters in FDD systems, the downlink channel\nestimation can be greatly simplified, where only limited pilots are needed to\nobtain downlink complex gains and reconstruct downlink channels. Furthermore,\nthe uplink and downlink channel covariance matrices can be constructed from\nthese frequency-insensitive channel parameters rather than through a long-term\naverage, which enables the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) channel estimation\nto further enhance performance. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority\nof the proposed scheme over the conventional methods in mmWave communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 16:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

While traffic laws are easily embedded into an artificial\nbrain, modeling human complex behaviors which come from past experience is a\nmore challenging task. One of these behaviors is the capability of\ncommunicating intentions and negotiating the right of way through driving\nactions, as when a driver is entering a crowded roundabout and observes other\ncars movements to guess the best time to merge in. In addition, each driver has\nits own unique driving style, which is conditioned by both its personal\ncharacteristics, such as age and quality of sight, and external factors, such\nas being late or in a bad mood. For these reasons, the interaction between\ndifferent drivers is not trivial to simulate in a realistic manner. In this\npaper, this problem is addressed by developing a microscopic simulator using a\nDeep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm based on a combination of visual frames,\nrepresenting the perception around the vehicle, and a vector of numerical\nparameters. In particular, the algorithm called Asynchronous Advantage\nActor-Critic has been extended to a multi-agent scenario in which every agent\nneeds to learn to interact with other similar agents. Moreover, the model\nincludes a novel architecture such that the driving style of each vehicle is\nadjustable by tuning some of its input parameters, permitting to simulate\ndrivers with different levels of aggressiveness and desired cruising speeds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 17:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

The approach leverages continuous- and\ndiscrete-time evolutionary dynamical systems applied to empirical games, and\nscales tractably in the number of agents, the type of interactions, and the\ntype of empirical games (symmetric and asymmetric). Current models are\nfundamentally limited in one or more of these dimensions and are not guaranteed\nto converge to the desired game-theoretic solution concept (typically the Nash\nequilibrium). $\\alpha$-Rank provides a ranking over the set of agents under\nevaluation and provides insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and\nlong-term dynamics. This is a consequence of the links we establish to the MCC\nsolution concept when the underlying evolutionary model's ranking-intensity\nparameter, $\\alpha$, is chosen to be large, which exactly forms the basis of\n$\\alpha$-Rank. In contrast to the Nash equilibrium, which is a static concept\nbased on fixed points, MCCs are a dynamical solution concept based on the\nMarkov chain formalism, Conley's Fundamental Theorem of Dynamical Systems, and\nthe core ingredients of dynamical systems: fixed points, recurrent sets,\nperiodic orbits, and limit cycles. $\\alpha$-Rank runs in polynomial time with\nrespect to the total number of pure strategy profiles, whereas computing a Nash\nequilibrium for a general-sum game is known to be intractable.

Therefore, recruiting trustworthy contributors plays\na crucial role in collecting high-quality data and providing better quality of\nservices while minimizing the vulnerabilities and risks to MCS systems. In this\narticle, a novel trust model called Experience-Reputation (E-R) is proposed for\nevaluating trust relationships between any two mobile device users in a MCS\nplatform.

Previous\nstudies of AMS-02 antiprotons revealed a possible hint for a DM signal which,\nhowever, could be affected by systematic uncertainties. To test the robustness\nof such a DM signal, in this work we systematically study two important sources\nof uncertainties: the antiproton production cross sections needed to calculate\nthe source spectra of secondary antiprotons and the potential correlations in\nthe experimental data, so far not provided by the AMS-02 Collaboration. To\ninvestigate the impact of cross-section uncertainties we perform global fits of\nCR spectra including a covariance matrix determined from nuclear cross-section\nmeasurements. As an alternative approach, we perform a joint fit to both the CR\nand cross-section data. The two methods agree and show that cross-section\nuncertainties have a small effect on the CR fits and on the significance of a\npotential DM signal, which we find to be at the level of $3\\sigma$.\nCorrelations in the data can have a much larger impact. To illustrate this\neffect, we determine possible benchmark models for the correlations in a\ndata-driven method. The inclusion of correlations strongly improves the\nconstraints on the propagation model and, furthermore, enhances the\nsignificance of the DM signal up to above $5\\sigma$. Our analysis demonstrates\nthe importance of providing the covariance of the experimental data, which is\nneeded to fully exploit their potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 19:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 08:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

The result is that for an\ninference task with a given number of interesting parameters, the number of\nsimulations required to perform likelihood-free inference can be kept (roughly)\nthe same irrespective of the number of additional nuisances to be marginalized\nover. To achieve this we introduce two extensions to the standard\nlikelihood-free inference set-up.

Recent observations of the Bulge, e.g., its X-shape, cylindrical\nstellar motions, and a potential fraction of young stars propose that it formed\nthrough secular evolution of the disk and not through gas dissipation and/or\nmergers, as thought previously. Aims. We measure abundances of six iron-peak\nelements (Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Co and Ni) in the local thin and thick disks as well\nas the Bulge to provide additional observational constraints for Galaxy\nformation and chemical evolution models. Methods. We use high-resolution\noptical spectra of 291 K giants in the local disk mostly obtained by the FIES\nat NOT (signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 80-100) and 45 K giants in the Bulge\nobtained by the UVES/FLAMES at VLT (S/N ratio of 10-80). We measure abundances\nin SME and apply NLTE corrections to the [Mn/Fe] and [Co/Fe] ratios. To\ndiscriminate between the thin and thick, we use stellar metallicity,\n[Ti/Fe]-ratios, and kinematics from Gaia DR2 (proper motions and the radial\nvelocities). Results. The observed disk trend of V is more enhanced in the\nthick disk, while the Co disk trend shows a minor enhancement in the thick\ndisk. The Bulge trends of V and Co appear even more enhanced w.r.t. the thick\ndisk, but within the uncertainties. The [Ni/Fe] ratio seems slightly\noverabundant in the thick disk and the Bulge w.r.t. the thin disk, although the\ndifference is minor. The disk and Bulge trends of Sc, Cr and Mn overlap\nstrongly. Conclusions. The somewhat enhanced [(V,Co)/Fe] ratios observed in the\nBulge suggest that the local thick disk and the Bulge might have experienced\ndifferent chemical enrichment and evolutionary paths. However, we are unable to\npredict the exact evolutionary path of the Bulge solely based on these\nobservations. Galactic chemical evolution models could, on the other hand,\nprovide that using these results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 19:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-29"}

The Spitzer observation rules out the\nexistence of transit timing variations (TTVs) of order hours to days that are\nknown to exist for other long-period exoplanets. Such TTVs render transit\nfollow-up efforts intractable due to the substantial observing time required\nand the high risk of non-detection. For Kepler-167e, however, we are now able\nto predict future transit times through the anticipated era of the James Webb\nSpace Telescope with uncertainties of less than six minutes.

We\nshow that their low-energy physics can be understood as dynamics within the\nspace of classical ground states. We demonstrate this mapping in a family of\nquantum spin clusters where every pair of spins is connected by an $XY$\nantiferromagnetic bond. The dimer with two spin-$S$ spins provides the simplest\nexample, it maps to a quantum particle on a ring ($S^1$). The trimer is more\ncomplex, equivalent to a particle that lives on two disjoint rings ($S^1\\otimes\n\\mathbb{Z}_2$). It has an additional subtlety for half-integer $S$ values,\nwherein both rings must be threaded by $\\pi$-fluxes to obtain a satisfactory\nmapping. This is a consequence of the geometric phase incurred by spins. For\nboth the dimer and the trimer, the effective theory can be seen from a\npath-integral-based derivation. This approach cannot be extended to the\nquadrumer which has a non-manifold ground state space, consisting of three tori\nthat touch pairwise along lines. In order to understand the dynamics of a\nparticle in this space, we develop a tight-binding model with this\nconnectivity. Remarkably, this successfully reproduces the low-energy spectrum\nof the quadrumer. For half-integer spins, a geometric phase emerges which can\nbe mapped to two $\\pi$-flux tubes that reside in the space between the tori.\nThe non-manifold character of the space leads to a remarkable effect - the\ndynamics at low energies is not ergodic as the particle is localized around\nsingular lines of the ground state space. The low-energy spectrum consists of\nan extensive number of bound states formed around singularities. Physically,\nthis manifests as an order-by-disorder-like preference for collinear ground\nstates.

The framework reduces the\nnegative effects of electric vehicle charging demand on the electrical grids.\nTo solve the scheduling problem, a novel hierarchical distributed EV charging\nscheduling (HDEVCS) is developed as the \\textit{exchange problem}, where the\nagents are clustered based on their coupling constraints. According to the\nseparability of the agents' objectives and the clusters' coupled constraints,\nHDEVCS is solved efficiently in a distributed manner by the alternating\ndirection method of multipliers. Comparing to the exiting trilayer methods,\nHDEVCS reduces the convergence time and the iteration numbers since its\nstructure allows the agents to update their primal optimization variable\nsimultaneously. The performance of HDEVCS is evaluated by numerical simulation\nof two small- and large- scale case studies consisting of $306$ and $9051$\nagents, respectively.

Compounding VANETs and modern vehicles will allow adversaries to\ngain access to the in-vehicle networks and take control of vehicles remotely to\nuse them as a target or a foothold. Extensive attention has been given to the\nsecurity breaches in VANETs and in-vehicle networks in literature but there is\na gap in literature to assess the security vulnerabilities associated with\nVANETs access technologies. That is, in this paper we contribute to the CAV\nsecurity literature in threefold. First, we synthesize the current literature\nin order to investigate security attacks and countermeasures on VANETs as an ad\nhoc network. Second, we survey security challenges that emerge from application\nof different VANETs access technologies. To augment this discussion, we\ninvestigate security solutions to thwart adversaries to compromise the access\ntechnologies. Third, we provide a detailed comparison of different access\ntechnologies performance, security challenges and propound heterogeneous\ntechnologies to achieve the highest security and best performance in VANETs.\nThese access technologies extend from DSRC, Satellite Radio, and Bluetooth to\nVLC and 5G. The outcome of this study is of critical importance, because of two\nmain reasons: (1) independent studies on security of VANETs on different strata\nneed to come together and to be covered from a whole end-to-end system\nperspective, (2) adversaries taking control of the VANETs entities will\ncompromise the safety, privacy, and security of the road users and will be\nfollowed by legal exposures, as well as data, time and monetary losses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 21:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

Quantum mechanically a nonlocal star is a\nself-gravitational bound system of many gravitons interacting nonlocally.\nOutside the nonlocal star the spacetime is well described by the Schwarzschild\nmetric, while inside we have a non-vacuum spacetime metric which tends to be\nconformally flat at the origin.

Methods. We conducted a test\nwith ESA's Venus Express (VEX), to evaluate the performance of the PRIDE\ntechnique for this particular application.

However, a major challenge has been the\nconfirmation of Kepler planet candidates, many of which still await\nconfirmation. One of the most enigmatic examples is KOI 4.01, Kepler's first\ndiscovered planet candidate detection (as KOI 1.01, 2.01, and 3.01 were known\nprior to launch). Here we present the confirmation and characterization of KOI\n4.01 (now Kepler-1658), using a combination of asteroseismology and radial\nvelocities. Kepler-1658 is a massive, evolved subgiant (Mstar = 1.45 +/- 0.06\nMsun, Rstar = 2.89 +/- 0.12 Rsun) hosting a massive (Mp = 5.88 +/- 0.47 MJ, Rp\n= 1.07 +/- 0.05 RJ) hot Jupiter that orbits every 3.85 days. Kepler-1658 joins\na small population of evolved hosts with short-period (<=100 days) planets and\nis now the closest known planet in terms of orbital period to an evolved star.\nBecause of its uniqueness and short orbital period, Kepler-1658 is a new\nbenchmark system for testing tidal dissipation and hot Jupiter formation\ntheories. Using all 4 years of Kepler data, we constrain the orbital decay rate\nto be Pdot <= -0.42 s/yr, corresponding to a strong observational limit of\nQstar >= 4.826 x 10^3 for the tidal quality factor in evolved stars. With an\neffective temperature Teff ~6200 K, Kepler-1658 sits close to the spin-orbit\nmisalignment boundary at ~6250 K, making it a prime target for follow-up\nobservations to better constrain its obliquity and to provide insight into\ntheories for hot Jupiter formation and migration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 23:50:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

In previous work we\nidentified five well resolved galaxies with atypical kinematics from a\ncosmological simulation; two had kinematically distinct cores (KDCs), and three\nhad counter-rotating gas and stars (CRGD). In this paper, we show that i) the\nKDC galaxies have flattening of stellar [O/Fe] at large galacto-centric radii\ndue to the minor mergers that gave rise to the KDCs, and ii) the CRGD galaxies\nhave an abrupt transition in the gas metallicity maps, from high metallicity in\nthe centre to very low metallicity further out. These galaxies are embedded in\ndark matter filaments where there is a ready supply of near-pristine gas to\ncause this effect. The non-linear increase in gas metallicity is also seen in\nthe radial profiles, but when the metallicity gradients are measured, the\ndifference is buried in the scatter of the relation. We also find that all five\ngalaxies are fairly compact, with small effective radii given their stellar\nmasses. This is because they have not experienced major mergers that\nkinematically heat the stars, and would have destroyed their unusual\nkinematics.

In particular,\nthe \"lottery ticket hypothesis\" conjectures that typical neural networks\ncontain small subnetworks that can train to similar accuracy in a commensurate\nnumber of steps. The evidence for this claim is that a procedure based on\niterative magnitude pruning (IMP) reliably finds such subnetworks retroactively\non small vision tasks. However, IMP fails on deeper networks, and proposed\nmethods to prune before training or train pruned networks encounter similar\nscaling limitations. In this paper, we argue that these efforts have struggled\non deeper networks because they have focused on pruning precisely at\ninitialization. We modify IMP to search for subnetworks that could have been\nobtained by pruning early in training (0.1% to 7% through) rather than at\niteration 0. With this change, it finds small subnetworks of deeper networks\n(e.g., 80% sparsity on Resnet-50) that can complete the training process to\nmatch the accuracy of the original network on more challenging tasks (e.g.,\nImageNet). In situations where IMP fails at iteration 0, the accuracy benefits\nof delaying pruning accrue rapidly over the earliest iterations of training. To\nexplain these behaviors, we study subnetwork \"stability,\" finding that - as\naccuracy improves in this fashion - IMP subnetworks train to parameters closer\nto those of the full network and do so with improved consistency in the face of\ngradient noise.

As the advances in fabrication technology have\ndriven the devices smaller and smaller, the demand has grown steadily for\nimproving its resolving power, which is determined mainly by the size of the\nprobe attached to the scanner. The use of a smaller probe has been a\nstraightforward approach to increase the resolving power, but it cannot be made\narbitrarily small in practice due to the steep reduction of the collection\nefficiency. Here, we develop a method to enhance the resolving power of\nnear-field imaging beyond the limit set by the physical size of the probe\naperture. The main working principle is to unveil high-order near-field\neigenmodes invisible with conventional near-field microscopy. The destructive\ninterference of near-field waves is induced in these high-order eigenmodes by\nthe locally varying phases, which can reveal subaperture-scale fine structural\ndetails. To extract these eigenmodes, we construct a self-interference\nnear-field microscopy system and measure a fully phase-referenced far- to\nnear-field transmission matrix (FNTM) composed of near-field amplitude and\nphase maps recorded for various angles of far-field illumination. By the\nsingular value decomposition of the measured FNTM, we could extract the\nantisymmetric mode, quadrupole mode, and other higher-order modes hidden under\nthe lowest-order symmetric mode. This enables us to resolve double and triple\nnano-slots whose gap size (50 nm) is three times smaller than the diameter of\nthe probe aperture (150 nm).

It is well-known that single high-gain observers (HGO) are not able to\nprovide satisfactory performance when the system output is contaminated by\nnoise. More specifically, there is a trade-off between the convergence speed of\nstate estimation and the bound of steady estimation error in HGO when the\noutput measurement is contaminated by noise. In the presented scheme, the\noutput feedback controller utilizes the state estimation obtained from an\nappropriate combination of information provided by a bank of HGOs. The proposed\nstrategy is capable of mitigating the destructive effects of measurement noise\nand speeding up the convergence process, and it does that because it introduces\nan extra design parameter. The performance recovery capabilities of MHGO-based\ncontrollers and the stability of the closed-loop system are discussed.\nSimulations are performed on an underwater vehicle system and a mechanical\nsystem to evaluate the performance of the MHGO-based controller.

Training deep neural networks is computationally expensive and\nrequires both human and intellectual resources. Therefore, it is necessary to\nprotect the intellectual property of the model and externally verify the\nownership of the model. However, previous studies either fail to defend against\nthe evasion attack or have not explicitly dealt with fraudulent claims of\nownership by adversaries. Furthermore, they can not establish a clear\nassociation between the model and the creator's identity.\n  To fill these gaps, in this paper, we propose a novel intellectual property\nprotection (IPP) framework based on blind-watermark for watermarking deep\nneural networks that meet the requirements of security and feasibility. Our\nframework accepts ordinary samples and the exclusive logo as inputs, outputting\nnewly generated samples as watermarks, which are almost indistinguishable from\nthe origin, and infuses these watermarks into DNN models by assigning specific\nlabels, leaving the backdoor as the basis for our copyright claim. We evaluated\nour IPP framework on two benchmark datasets and 15 popular deep learning\nmodels. The results show that our framework successfully verifies the ownership\nof all the models without a noticeable impact on their primary task. Most\nimportantly, we are the first to successfully design and implement a\nblind-watermark based framework, which can achieve state-of-art performances on\nundetectability against evasion attack and unforgeability against fraudulent\nclaims of ownership. Further, our framework shows remarkable robustness and\nestablishes a clear association between the model and the author's identity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 09:32:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 08:43:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 06:54:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 2019 13:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-11"}

The central idea is to reduce the\nvariance of the solution at the expense of introducing a little distortion. In\nthe context of parameter estimation, this yields an estimator whose sum of\ndistortion plus variance is smaller than the variance of its undistorted\ncounterpart. The method intrinsically results in an ordering mechanism for the\nsingular vectors of the system matrix in the measurement model used for\nestimating the parameter of interest. According to this ordering rule, only a\nfew \\emph{dominant} singular vectors need to be selected to construct the\nreduced-rank solution while the rest can be discarded. The reduced-rank\nestimator is less sensitive to measurement errors. In this paper, we attempt to\nderive the reduced-rank estimator for the total least squares (TLS) problem,\nincluding the order selection rule. It will be shown that, due to the inherent\nstructure of the problem, it is not possible to exploit the distortion-variance\ntradeoff in TLS formulations using existing techniques, except in some special\ncases. This result has not been reported previously and warrants a new\nviewpoint to achieve rank reduction for the TLS estimation problem.

A classical SSSP\nalgorithm detects a negative cycle of $G$ or constructs a shortest-path tree\n(SPT) rooted at $s$ in $O(mn)$ time, where $m,n$ are the numbers of edges and\nvertices in $G$ respectively. In many practical applications, new constraints\ncome from time to time and we need to update the SPT frequently. Given an SPT\n$T$ of $G$, suppose the weight on a certain edge is modified. We show by\nrigorous proof that the well-known {\\sf Ball-String} algorithm for positively\nweighted graphs can be adapted to solve the dynamic SPT problem for directed\ngraphs with arbitrary weights.

The comparison with single-star evolutionary tracks suggests\na dichotomy in the fate of massive stars in the SMC.

We measure\nthe key parameters of stellar feedback and establish the links between the\nrates of star formation and supernovae.

A recent\nline of work tries to mitigate these issues by enforcing constraints, such as\ndifferential privacy, that compose adaptively while degrading gracefully and\nthus provide statistical guarantees even in adaptive contexts. Our contribution\nconsists in the introduction of a new approach, based on the concept of Maximal\nLeakage, an information-theoretic measure of leakage of information. The main\nresult allows us to compare the probability of an event happening when\nadaptivity is considered with respect to the non-adaptive scenario.

However, the two-block variable structure of the ADMM still\nlimits the practical computational efficiency of the method, because one big\nmatrix factorization is needed at least once even for linear and convex\nquadratic programming. This drawback may be overcome by enforcing a multi-block\nstructure of the decision variables in the original optimization problem.\nUnfortunately, the multi-block ADMM, with more than two blocks, is not\nguaranteed to be convergent.

Secondly,\nsuch a randomly permuted ADMM also works for equality-constrained convex\nquadratic programming even when the objective function is not separable. The\ngoal of this paper is twofold. First, we add more randomness into the ADMM by\ndeveloping a randomly assembled cyclic ADMM (RAC-ADMM) where the decision\nvariables in each block are randomly assembled. We discuss the theoretical\nproperties of RAC-ADMM and show when random assembling helps and when it hurts,\nand develop a criterion to guarantee that it converges almost surely.

The\nmultiplicity dependence of $v_n$ is studied in a very wide range from 20 to\n3000 particles produced in the mid-rapidity region $|\\eta|<0.8$ for the\ntransverse momentum range $0.2 < p_{\\rm T} < 3.0$ GeV/$c$. An ordering of the\ncoefficients $v_2 > v_3 > v_4$ is found in pp and p-Pb collisions, similar to\nthat seen in large collision systems, while a weak $v_2$ multiplicity\ndependence is observed relative to nucleus-nucleus collisions in the same\nmultiplicity range. Using a novel subevent method, $v_{2}$ measured with\nfour-particle cumulants is found to be compatible with that from six-particle\ncumulants in pp and p-Pb collisions. The magnitude of the correlation between\n$v_n^2$ and $v_m^2$, evaluated with the symmetric cumulants SC$(m,n)$ is\nobserved to be positive at all multiplicities for $v_2$ and $v_4$, while for\n$v_2$ and $v_3$ it is negative and changes sign for multiplicities below 100,\nwhich may indicate a different $v_n$ fluctuation pattern in this multiplicity\nrange.

Common measurement techniques to determine the condition of\nthe aorta are limited to the acquisition of the arterial pulse wave at the\nextremities. The goal of this work is to enable non-invasive measurements of\nthe aortic pulse wave velocity, instead. An additional aim is to extract\nfurther information, related to the conditions of the aorta, from the pulse\nwave signal instead of only its velocity. Methods: After discussing the\nproblems of common pulse wave analysis procedures, an approach to determine the\nfrequency response of the aorta is presented. Therefore, the aorta is modelled\nas an electrical equivalent circuit. To determine the specific numeric values\nof this system, a measurement approach is presented, which is based on\nnon-invasive bioimpedance plethysmography measurements above the aortic arch\nand at the inguinal region. The conversion of the measurement results to the\nsystem parameters is realized by a digital algorithm, which is proposed in this\nwork as well. To evaluate the approach, a study on three subjects is performed.\nResults: The measurement results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields\nrealistic frequency responses. For better approximation of the aortic system\nfunction, more complex models are recommended to investigate in the future.\nSince this study is limited to three subjects without a ground truth, further\nmeasurements will be necessary.

For a\nlarge variety of materials, increasing disorder reduces electronic screening\nwhich enhances electron-electron repulsion. These fermionic effects lead to a\nmechanism described by Finkelstein: when disorder combined to electron-electron\ninteractions increases, there is a global decrease of the superconducting\nenergy gap $\\Delta$ and of the critical temperature $T_c$, the ratio\n$\\Delta$/$k_BT_c$ remaining roughly constant. In addition, in most films an\nemergent granularity develops with increasing disorder and results in the\nformation of inhomogeneous superconducting puddles. These gap inhomogeneities\nare usually accompanied by the development of bosonic features: a pseudogap\ndevelops above the critical temperature $T_c$ and the energy gap $\\Delta$\nstarts decoupling from $T_c$. Thus the mechanism(s) driving the appearance of\nthese gap inhomogeneities could result from a complicated interplay between\nfermionic and bosonic effects. By studying the local electronic properties of a\nNbN film with scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) we show that the\ninhomogeneous spatial distribution of $\\Delta$ is locally strongly correlated\nto a large depletion in the local density of states (LDOS) around the Fermi\nlevel, associated to the Altshuler-Aronov effect induced by strong electronic\ninteractions.

Our\nstellar wind models incorporate surface stellar magnetic field maps at the\nepochs Jun/Jul 2013, Sep 2014, and Jul 2015 as boundary conditions. We find\nthat the mass-loss rate, angular momentum-loss rate, and open magnetic flux of\nHD189733 vary by 9%, 40%, and 19% over these three epochs. Solving the\nequations of radiative transfer, we find that from 10 MHz-100 GHz the stellar\nwind emits fluxes in the range of $10^{-3}$-$5$ $\\mu$Jy, and becomes optically\nthin above 10 GHz. Our planetary radio emission model uses the radiometric\nBode's law, and neglects the presence of a planetary atmosphere. For assumed\nplanetary magnetic fields of 1-10 G, we estimate that the planet emits at\nfrequencies of 2-25 MHz, with peak flux densities of $\\sim10^2$ mJy. We find\nthat the planet orbits through regions of the stellar wind that are optically\nthick to the emitted frequency from the planet. As a result, unattenuated\nplanetary radio emission can only propagate out of the system and reach the\nobserver for 67% of the orbit for a 10 G planetary field, corresponding to when\nthe planet is approaching and leaving primary transit. We also find that the\nplasma frequency of the stellar wind is too high to allow propagation of the\nplanetary radio emission below 21 MHz. This means a planetary field of at least\n8 G is required to produce detectable radio emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 13:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

The virtual scene's ground truth demonstrates that 3D\npre-selection eliminates a large portion of false positives that are normally\nconsidered repeated in 2D configurations. The results indicate that 3D virtual\nenvironments can provide assistance in comparing the performance of\nconventional detectors when extending their applications to 3D environments,\nand can result in better classification of features when testing prospective\nclassifiers' performance. A ROC based informedness measure also highlights\ntradeoffs in 2D/3D performance compared to conventional repeatability measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 14:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

The only assumption in our approach is that the\npolarizability matrix (chi) of the interface can be given by the sum of the\npolarizability matrices of individual components of the interface. We show\nanalytically, using a two-state hybridized model, that this assumption is valid\neven in the presence of interface hybridization to form bonding and\nanti-bonding states, up to first order in the overlap matrix elements involved\nin the hybridization. We validate our approach by showing that the band\nstructure obtained in our method is almost identical to that obtained using a\nregular GW calculation for bilayer black phosphorus, where interlayer\nhybridization is significant. Significant savings in computational time and\nmemory are obtained by computing chi only for the smallest sub-unit cell of\neach component, and expanding (unfolding) the chi matrix to that in the unit\ncell of the interface. To treat interface hybridization, the full wavefunctions\nof the interface are used in computing the self-energy. We thus call the method\nXAF-GW (X: eXpand-chi, A: Add-chi, F: Full wavefunctions).

We demonstrate results of our CPU based AO RTC operating firstly in SCAO\nmode, using either Shack-Hartmann or Pyramid style WFS processing, and then in\nMCAO mode and in LTAO mode using the specifications of the proposed ELT\ninstruments, MAORY and HARMONI. All results are gathered using a CPU based\ncamera simulator utilising UDP packets to better demonstrate the pixel\nstreaming and pipe-lining of the RTC software. We demonstrate the effects of\nswitching parameters, streaming telemetry and implicit pseudo open-loop control\n(POLC) computation on the MCAO and LTAO modes. We achieve results of <\n600$\\mu$s latency with an ELT scale SCAO setup using Shack-Hartman processing\nand < 800$\\mu$s latency with SCAO Pyramid WFS processing. We show that our MCAO\nand LTAO many core CPU architecture can achieve full system latencies of <\n1000$\\mu$s with jitters < 40$\\mu$s RMS.

The second one is to investigate the significance of two\nnew terms in the energy conservation equation. They originate from the gravity\nof the outer shells of cloud and the masses outer to the cloud, respectively.\nThe third goal is to investigate the main equation in the case when the kinetic\nturbulent term scales according to Larson's law and it is independent,\nformally, of the accretion, in contrast to the previous work. The combination\nof supersonic turbulence and spherical symmetry raises a caveat which is\ncommented in our conclusions. We obtained two solutions for the density\nprofile. They scale with slopes -2 and -3/2, respectively. The energy balance\nfor the second solution is the same as in the previous paper: this is a\nfree-fall. For the first solution there are two cases. The first one: if the\nturbulent term does not scale, then it could be important for the energy\nbalance of the cloud. The second one: if the turbulent term does scale, then it\nis not important for the energy balance of the cloud. The two new gravitational\nterms don't affect the existence of the two solutions, but the gravitation of\nthe outer masses calibrate the energy balance for the first solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 15:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

We present\ntime-averaged velocities, RMS velocity fluctuations, mean entrainment and\nunsteady flow features and compare them with previous studies on free jets. We\nfind that plunging jets have a smaller potential core length, and earlier decay\nof the mean centerline velocity. The peak RMS velocity fluctuations occur at a\nlocation significantly upstream compared to the free jets reported in the\nliterature. Near-field ambient fluid entrainment of plunging jets is measured\nfor the first time and is found to be considerably higher than free jets in the\nlow Reynolds number range. For the plunging jet case at Re = 3000, faster jet\ndecay, higher levels of turbulent intensity in the near-field, and augmented\nmass entrainment result from strong primary vortices that give the\nturbulent/non-turbulent interface (TNTI) its convoluted shape which facilitates\nboth bulk entrapment of ambient fluid and small scale nibbling because of\nlarger surface area. These primary vortices occur right below the free surface\nand disintegrate into secondary structures at axial locations that are upstream\ncompared to those of free jets. At higher Reynolds numbers, primary vortices\nare smaller in size, weak in swirling strength, and disintegrate prematurely,\nresulting in suppressed mixing and reduced entrainment efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 15:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

However, the existing efficient\nmethods computing the exact LZ parsing have to use linear or close to linear\nspace to index the input text during the construction of the parsing, which is\nprohibitive for long inputs. An alternative is Relative Lempel-Ziv (RLZ), which\nindexes only a fixed reference sequence, whose size can be controlled. Deriving\nthe reference sequence by sampling the text yields reasonable compression\nratios for RLZ, but performance is not always competitive with that of LZ and\ndepends heavily on the similarity of the reference to the text. In this paper\nwe introduce ReLZ, a technique that uses RLZ as a preprocessor to approximate\nthe LZ parsing using little memory. RLZ is first used to produce a sequence of\nphrases, and these are regarded as metasymbols that are input to LZ for a\nsecond-level parsing on a (most often) drastically shorter sequence. This\nparsing is finally translated into one on the original sequence.\n  We analyze the new scheme and prove that, like LZ, it achieves the $k$th\norder empirical entropy compression $n H_k + o(n\\log\\sigma)$ with $k =\no(\\log_\\sigma n)$, where $n$ is the input length and $\\sigma$ is the alphabet\nsize. In fact, we prove this entropy bound not only for ReLZ but for a wide\nclass of LZ-like encodings. Then, we establish a lower bound on ReLZ\napproximation ratio showing that the number of phrases in it can be\n$\\Omega(\\log n)$ times larger than the number of phrases in LZ. Our experiments\nshow that ReLZ is faster than existing alternatives to compute the (exact or\napproximate) LZ parsing, at the reasonable price of an approximation factor\nbelow $2.0$ in all tested scenarios, and sometimes below $1.05$, to the size of\nLZ.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 15:50:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 May 2020 17:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

Combining linear stability analysis and full nonlinear\nsimulation, we study the instability of an initially one-dimensional base state\nto the growth of two-dimensional perturbations with wavevector in the flow\ndirection. We do so within three widely used constitutive models: the\nmicroscopically motivated Rolie-Poly model, and the phenomenological\nJohnson-Segalman and White-Metzner models. In each model, we find instability\nwhen the degree of shear thinning exceeds some level characterised by the\nlogarithmic slope of the flow curve at its shallowest point.

Within each\nmodel, we show that the critical pressure drop for the onset of instability\nobeys a criterion expressed in terms of this degree of shear thinning, $n$,\ntogether with the derivative of the first normal stress with respect to shear\nstress. Both shear thinning and rapid variations in first normal stress across\nthe channel are therefore key ingredients driving the instability. In the\nRolie-Poly and Johnson-Segalman models, the underlying mechanism appears to\ninvolve the destabilisation of a quasi-interface that exists in each half of\nthe channel, across which the normal stress varies rapidly. In the\nWhite-Metzner model, no such quasi-interface exists, but the criterion for\ninstability nonetheless appears to follow the same form as in the Rolie-Poly\nand Johnson-Segalman models.

The ascent variables\nmove in the direction of the gradient, while the descent variables move in the\nopposite direction. Dynamical systems of this form or very similar forms have\nbeen studied in diverse fields such as game theory, optimization, neural\nnetworks, and population biology. Gradient descent-ascent is approximated as a\nNewtonian dynamical system that conserves total energy, defined as the sum of\nthe kinetic energy and a potential energy that is proportional to the payoff\nfunction. The error of the approximation is a residual force that violates\nenergy conservation. If the residual force is purely dissipative, then the\nenergy serves as a Lyapunov function, and convergence of bounded trajectories\nto steady states is guaranteed. A previous convergence theorem due to Kose and\nUzawa required the payoff function to be convex in the descent variables, and\nconcave in the ascent variables. Here the assumption is relaxed, so that the\npayoff function need only be globally `less convex' or `more concave' in the\nascent variables than in the descent variables.

After some delay\ntime after beginning of the illumination, a giant bubble explosively grows, up\nto a maximal radius of 80 um, and collapses again within 200 us (bubble life\nphase 1). The maximal bubble volume remarkably increases with decreasing laser\npower P. To explain this behavior, we measure the delay time from the beginning\nof the illumination up to nucleation,which drastically increases with\ndecreasing laser power, leading to less total dumped energy . This dumped\nenergy E shows a universal linear scaling relation. This finding supports that\nthe initial giant bubble is a pure vapor bubble. In contrast, the delay time\ndoes depend on the gas concentration of the water, as gas pockets in the water\nfacilitate an earlier vapor bubble nucleation, which leads to smaller delay\ntimes and lower bubble nucleation temperatures. After the collapse of the\ninitial giant bubbles, first much smaller oscillating bubbles form out of the\nremaining gas nuclei (bubble life phase 2, up to typically 10 ms). Subsequently\nthe known vaporization dominated growth phase takes over and the bubble\nstabilizes (life phase 3). In the final life phase 4 the bubble slowly grows by\ngas expelling due to heating of the surrounding. Our findings on the explosive\ngrowth and collapse during the early life phase of a vapor bubble have strong\nbearings on possible applications of such bubbles, affecting their risk\nassessment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 2019 01:25:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 07:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-15"}

However, achieving the highest Quality-of-Results (QoR) with\nHLS is still unattainable for most programmers. This requires detailed\nknowledge of FPGA architecture and hardware design in order to produce\nFPGA-friendly codes. Moreover, these codes are normally in conflict with best\ncoding practices, which favor code reuse, modularity, and conciseness.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Module-per-Object (MpO), a\nhuman-driven HLS design methodology intended for both hardware designers and\nsoftware developers with limited FPGA expertise. MpO exploits modern C++ to\nraise the abstraction level while improving QoR, code readability and\nmodularity. To guide HLS designers, we present the five characteristics of MpO\nclasses. Each characteristic exploits the power of HLS-supported modern C++\nfeatures to build C++-based hardware modules. These characteristics lead to\nhigh-quality software descriptions and efficient hardware generation. We also\npresent a use case of MpO, where we use C++ as the intermediate language for\nFPGA-targeted code generation from P4, a packet processing domain specific\nlanguage. The MpO methodology is evaluated using three design experiments: a\npacket parser, a flow-based traffic manager, and a digital up-converter. Based\non experiments, we show that MpO can be comparable to hand-written VHDL code\nwhile keeping a high abstraction level, human-readable coding style and\nmodularity. Compared to traditional C-based HLS design, MpO leads to more\nefficient circuit generation, both in terms of performance and resource\nutilization.
