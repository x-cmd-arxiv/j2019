However, new models predict that planetesimals\nshould first form at the water ice line such that close-in planets are expected\nto have a significant water ice component. Here we investigate the water\ncontents of super-Earths by studying the interplay between pebble accretion,\nplanet migration and disc evolution. Planets' compositions are determined by\ntheir position relative to different condensation fronts (ice lines) throughout\ntheir growth. Migration plays a key role. Assuming that planetesimals start at\nor exterior to the water ice line ($r>r_{\\rm H_2O}$), inward migration causes\nplanets to leave the source region of icy pebbles and therefore to have lower\nfinal water contents than in discs with either outward migration or no\nmigration. The water ice line itself moves inward as the disc evolves, and\ndelivers water as it sweeps across planets that formed dry. The relative speed\nand direction of planet migration and inward drift of the water ice line is\nthus central in determining planets' water contents. If planet formation starts\nat the water ice line, this implies that hot close-in super-Earths (r<0.3 AU)\nwith water contents of a few percent are a signpost of inward planet migration\nduring the early gas phase. Hot super-Earths with larger water ice contents on\nthe other hand, experienced outward migration at the water ice line and only\nmigrated inwards after their formation was complete either because they become\ntoo massive to be contained in the region of outward migration or in chains of\nresonant planets. Measuring the water ice content of hot super-Earths may thus\nconstrain their migration history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 16:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

This paper proposes a\nhigh-confidence manipulation localization architecture which utilizes\nresampling features, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells, and encoder-decoder\nnetwork to segment out manipulated regions from non-manipulated ones.\nResampling features are used to capture artifacts like JPEG quality loss,\nupsampling, downsampling, rotation, and shearing.

Many popular phase\nretrieval algorithms are based on the following two-step procedure: (i)\ninitialize the algorithm based on a spectral method, (ii) refine the initial\nestimate by a local search algorithm (e.g., gradient descent). The quality of\nthe spectral initialization step can have a major impact on the performance of\nthe overall algorithm. In this paper, we focus on the model where the\nmeasurement matrix $\\mathbf{A}=[\\mathbf{a}_1,\\ldots,\\mathbf{a}_m]^{\\mathrm{H}}$\nhas orthonormal columns, and study the spectral initialization under the\nasymptotic setting $m,n\\to\\infty$ with $m/n\\to\\delta\\in(1,\\infty)$.

No model of internal tidal dissipation,\nhowever, can explain at the same time the total heat budget and the focusing of\nthe energy at the south pole. I study here whether the non-uniform icy shell\nthickness can cause the north-south heating asymmetry by redistributing tidal\nheating either in the shell or in the core. Starting from the non-uniform tidal\nthin shell equations, I compute the volumetric rate, surface flux, and total\npower generated by tidal dissipation in shell and core. If the shell is\nlaterally uniform, the thin shell approach predicts shell dissipation with a\nfew percent error while the error on core dissipation is negligible. Variations\nin shell thickness strongly increase the shell dissipation flux where the shell\nis thinner. For a hard shell with long-wavelength variations, the shell\ndissipation flux can be predicted by scaling with the inverse local thickness\nthe flux for a laterally uniform shell. If Enceladus's shell is in conductive\nthermal equilibrium with isostatic thickness variations, the nominal shell\ndissipation flux at the south pole is about three times its value for a shell\nof uniform thickness, which remains negligible compared to the observed flux.\nThe shell dissipation rate should be ten times higher than nominal in order to\naccount for the spatial variations of the observed flux. Dissipation in an\nunconsolidated core can provide the missing power, but does not generate any\nsignificant heating asymmetry as long as the core is homogeneous.

Topological photonic crystals in\nparticular show promise for coherent transport of light and quantum information\nat macroscopic scales. In this work, we apply for the first time the recently\ndeveloped theory of \"Topological quantum chemistry\" to the study of band\nstructures in photonic crystals. This method allows us to design and diagnose\ntopological photonic band structures using only group theory and linear\nalgebra. As an example, we focus on a family of crystals formed by elliptical\nrods in a triangular lattice. We show that the symmetry of Bloch states in the\nBrillouin zone can determine the position of the localized photonic wave\npackets describing groups of bands. By modifying the crystal structure and\ninverting bands, we show how the centers of these wave packets can be moved\nbetween different positions in the unit cell. Finally, we show that for shapes\nof dielectric rods, there exist isolated topological bands which do not admit a\nwell-localized description, representing the first physical instance of\n\"fragile\" topology in a truly noninteracting system. Our work demonstrates how\nphotonic crystals are the natural platform for the future experimental\ninvestigation of fragile topological bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 17:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

In\nevery parameter-estimation experiment, the final measurement or the\npostprocessing incurs some cost. Postselection can improve the rate of Fisher\ninformation (the average information learned about an unknown parameter from an\nexperimental trial) to cost. This improvement, we show, stems from the\nnegativity of a quasiprobability distribution, a quantum extension of a\nprobability distribution. In a classical theory, in which all observables\ncommute, our quasiprobability distribution can be expressed as real and\nnonnegative. In a quantum-mechanically noncommuting theory, nonclassicality\nmanifests in negative or nonreal quasiprobabilities. The distribution's\nnonclassically negative values enable postselected experiments to outperform\neven postselection-free experiments whose input states and final measurements\nare optimized: Postselected quantum experiments can yield anomalously large\ninformation-cost rates. We prove that this advantage is genuinely nonclassical:\nno classically commuting theory can describe any quantum experiment that\ndelivers an anomalously large Fisher information.

However, phase\ntransitions in these systems generically exhibit an effectively classical\nequilibrium behavior in spite of their non-equilibrium origin. In this paper,\nwe show that multicritical points in such systems lead to a rich and genuinely\nnon-equilibrium behavior. Specifically, we investigate a driven-dissipative\nmodel of interacting bosons that possesses two distinct phase transitions: one\nfrom a high- to a low-density phase---reminiscent of a liquid-gas\ntransition---and another to an antiferromagnetic phase. Each phase transition\nis described by the Ising universality class characterized by an (emergent or\nmicroscopic) $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. They, however, coalesce at a\nmulticritical point, giving rise to a non-equilibrium model of coupled\nIsing-like order parameters described by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$\nsymmetry. Using a dynamical renormalization-group approach, we show that a pair\nof non-equilibrium fixed points (NEFPs) emerge that govern the long-distance\ncritical behavior of the system. We elucidate various exotic features of these\nNEFPs. In particular, we show that a generic continuous scale invariance at\ncriticality is reduced to a discrete scale invariance. This further results in\ncomplex-valued critical exponents and spiraling phase boundaries, and it is\nalso accompanied by a complex Liouvillian gap even close to the phase\ntransition. As direct evidence of the non-equilibrium nature of the NEFPs, we\nshow that the fluctuation-dissipation relation is violated at all scales,\nleading to an effective temperature that becomes \"hotter\" and \"hotter\" at\nlonger and longer wavelengths. Finally, we argue that this non-equilibrium\nbehavior can be observed in cavity arrays with cross-Kerr nonlinearities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 19:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 19:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-28"}

One promising approach to this\nproblem is via the study of tidal disruption flares (TDFs). These are transient\nevents resulting from the disruption of stars by quiescent supermassive black\nholes at centers of galaxies. A meter-class X-ray observatory with a time\nresolution $\\sim$ a millisecond and a spectral resolution of a few eV at KeV\nenergies would be revolutionary as it will facilitate high signal to noise\nspectral-timing studies of several cosmological TDFs. It would open a new era\nof astrophysics where SMBHs in TDFs at cosmic distances can be studied in\nsimilar detail as current studies of much nearer, stellar-mass black hole\nbinaries. Using Athena X-ray observatory as an example, we highlight two\nspecific aspects of spectral-timing analysis of TDFs. (1) Detection of X-ray\nquasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) over a redshift range and using these signal\nfrequencies to constrain the spin evolution of SMBHs, and (2) Time-resolved\nspectroscopy of outflows/winds to probe super-Eddington accretion. SMBH spin\ndistributions at various redshifts will directly allow us to constrain their\nprimary mode of growth as higher spins are predicted due to spin-up for\nprolonged accretion-mode growth, while lower spins are expected for growth via\nmergers due to angular momentum being deposited from random directions. A\nmeter-class X-ray telescope will also be able to characterize relativistic\nTDFs, viz., SwJ1644+57-like events, out to a redshift greater than 8, i.e., it\nwould facilitate detailed spectral-timing studies of TDFs by the youngest SMBHs\nin the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 19:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-08"}

This paper describes\nBuddy Compression, a scheme to increase both the effective GPU memory capacity\nand bandwidth while avoiding the downsides of conventional memory-expanding\nstrategies. Buddy Compression compresses GPU memory, splitting each compressed\nmemory entry between high-speed device memory and a slower-but-larger\ndisaggregated memory pool (or system memory). Highly-compressible memory\nentries can thus be accessed completely from device memory, while\nincompressible entries source their data using both on and off-device accesses.\nIncreasing the effective GPU memory capacity enables us to run\nlarger-memory-footprint HPC workloads and larger batch-sizes or models for DL\nworkloads than current memory capacities would allow.

We present a 16\nsq. deg. survey of the disk and inner halo of M31 with MegaCam@CFHT to identify\nPNe, characterize their luminosity-specific PN number and luminosity function\n(PNLF). PNe were identified based on their bright OIII 5007 $\\unicode{x212B}$\nemission and absence of a continuum.

Specifically, we consider a model for dual-site phosphorylation and\ndephosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). We prove that\noscillations persist even as the model is greatly simplified (reactions are\nmade irreversible and intermediates are removed). Bistability, however, is much\nless robust -- this property is lost when intermediates are removed or even\nwhen all reactions are made irreversible. Moreover, bistability is\ncharacterized by the presence of two reversible, catalytic reactions: as other\nreactions are made irreversible, bistability persists as long as one or both of\nthe specified reactions is preserved. Finally, we investigate the maximum\nnumber of steady states, aided by a network's \"mixed volume\" (a concept from\nconvex geometry). Taken together, our results shed light on the question of how\noscillations and bistability emerge from a limiting network of the ERK network\n-- namely, the fully processive dual-site network -- which is known to be\nglobally stable and therefore lack both oscillations and bistability.

The discharges were selected for a comparison of\nJET-ILW and JET-C discharges with good confinement at high current (3 MA,\ncorresponding also to low $\\rho_*$) and retain the distinguishing features of\nJET-C and JET-ILW, notably, decreased pedestal top temperature for JET-ILW. A\ncomparison of the profiles and heating power reveals a stark qualitative\ndifference between the discharges: the JET-ILW pulse (92432) requires twice the\nheating power, at a gas rate of $1.9 \\times 10^{22}e/s$, to sustain roughly\nhalf the temperature gradient of the JET-C pulse (78697), operated at zero gas\nrate. This points to heat transport as a central component of the dynamics\nlimiting the JET-ILW pedestal and reinforces the following emerging JET-ILW\npedestal transport paradigm, which is proposed for further examination by both\ntheory and experiment. ILW conditions modify the density pedestal in ways that\ndecrease the normalized pedestal density gradient $a/L_n$, often via an outward\nshift of the density pedestal. This is attributable to some combination of\ndirect metal wall effects and the need for increased fueling to mitigate\ntungsten contamination. The modification to the density profile increases $\\eta\n= L_n/L_T$ , thereby producing more robust ion temperature gradient (ITG) and\nelectron temperature gradient driven instability. The decreased pedestal\ngradients for JET-ILW (92432) also result in a strongly reduced $E \\times B$\nshear rate, further enhancing the ion scale turbulence.

Though the noisy setting is well\nmotivated by many epidemic processes (e.g., most human epidemics), to the best\nof our knowledge, very little is known about when it is solvable. Previous work\non the no-noise setting critically uses the ordering information. If noise can\nreverse this -- a node's reported (noisy) infection time comes after the\nreported infection time of some node it infected -- then we are unable to see\nhow previous results can be extended.\n  We therefore tackle two versions of the noisy setting: the limited-noise\nsetting, where we know noisy times of infections, and the extreme-noise\nsetting, in which we only know whether or not a node was infected.

A negative side-effect of this sequential execution paradigm is that,\nas the environment becomes more and more challenging, and thus requiring more\ninteraction episodes for the meta-learner, it needs the agent to reason over\nlonger and longer time-scales. To combat the difficulty of long time-scale\ncredit assignment, we propose an alternative parallel framework, which we name\n\"Concurrent Meta-Reinforcement Learning\" (CMRL), that transforms the temporal\ncredit assignment problem into a multi-agent reinforcement learning one. In\nthis multi-agent setting, a set of parallel agents are executed in the same\nenvironment and each of these \"rollout\" agents are given the means to\ncommunicate with each other. The goal of the communication is to coordinate, in\na collaborative manner, the most efficient exploration of the shared task the\nagents are currently assigned. This coordination therefore represents the\nmeta-learning aspect of the framework, as each agent can be assigned or assign\nitself a particular section of the current task's state space. This framework\nis in contrast to standard RL methods that assume that each parallel rollout\noccurs independently, which can potentially waste computation if many of the\nrollouts end up sampling the same part of the state space. Furthermore, the\nparallel setting enables us to define several reward sharing functions and\nauxiliary losses that are non-trivial to apply in the sequential setting. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CMRL at improving over sequential\nmethods in a variety of challenging tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 03:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-08"}

The\ncontractile-force-per-unit-pressure is approximately constant over the stroke.\nThe theoretical maximum of this force is the product of the vacuum gauge\npressure and half the interior cross-sectional area of the tube. The\nexperimental evaluation revealed hysteretic losses that depend on the actuation\ndirection and rate. With -81 kPa, the prototype produced 12.7 N of tension\nduring extension and 7.5 N during retraction. The reinforced tubing of the\nInVAC was integrated with an inner collapsible \"clutching\" tube to create an\nInVACC. The clutch is engaged by applying a positive pressure between the\nreinforced tube and the clutching tube, which collapses the clutching tube onto\nthe flexible tendon. With a pressure of 50 kPa, the InVACC clutch tested in\nthis work was able to support a peak tensile load of 120 N before slipping.\nThough the fatigue life of the current prototypes is limited, improved\nfabrication methods for this novel actuator/clutch concept will enable new\napplications in robotics and wearable haptic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 04:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-08"}

To quantify the instrumental systematic errors, we\nperformed a series of simulations at pixel level that include various relevant\nsources of perturbations expected for PLATO. From the simulated pixels, we\nextract the photometry as planned on-board. The simulated light-curves are then\ncorrected for instrumental effects using the instrument Point Spread Functions\nreconstructed on the basis of a microscanning technique that will be operated\nduring the in-flight calibration phases.

Our model PoliNet takes in as input a visual trajectory and\nthe image of the robot's current view and outputs velocity commands for a\nplanning horizon of $N$ steps that optimally balance between trajectory\nfollowing and obstacle avoidance. PoliNet is trained using a strong image\npredictive model and traversability estimation model in a MPC setup, with\nminimal human supervision.

Consequently\nconsortiums are exploring private blockchains to keep their membership and\ntransactions private. However, private blockchains do not provide adequate\nprotection against potential collusion by consortium members to revert the\nstate of the blockchain. To countenance this, the private blockchain state may\nbe \"pinned\" to a tamper resistant public blockchain. Existing solutions\noffering pinning to the public blockchain would reveal the transaction rate of\nthe private blockchain, and do not provide a mechanism to contest the validity\nof a pin. Moreover, they require that all transactions and members of the\nprivate blockchain be revealed. These challenges are hampering the wider\nadoption of private blockchain technology.

It is well known that\nsuch inverse integral problems are ill-posed and one requires regularization\nmethods to approximate the solution appropriately. The commonly practiced\nregularization methods are (external) parameter-based like Tikhonov\nregularization, which have certain inherent difficulties like choosing an\noptimal value of the regularization parameter, especially in the absence of\nnoise information, which is a non-trivial task. An attractive alternative is\niterative regularization, where one minimizes an associated functional in a\nregularized fashion (i.e., stopping at an appropriate iteration). However, in\nmost of the regularization methods the associated minimizing functional\ncontains the noisy data directly, and hence, the recovery gets affected. In\nthis paper, we propose an iterative regularization method where the minimizing\nfunctional does not contain the noisy data directly. The advantage, in addition\nto circumventing the use of noisy data directly, is that the sequence of\nfunctions (or curves) constructed during the descent process does not converge\nstrongly to the noise data, rather weakly and hence, avoids overfitting.\nFurthermore, this method is very robust to extreme noise level in the data as\nwell as to errors with non-zero mean. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nnew method we provide some examples comparing the numerical results obtained\nfrom our method with results obtained from some of the popular regularization\nmethods such as Tikhonov regularization, total variation, smoothing spline and\nthe polynomial regression method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 07:57:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 19:44:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:28:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 2019 01:20:33 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 01:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

To\ndate, almost all the previous studies assume that views are complete. However,\nin reality, it is often the case that each view may contain some missing\ninstances. Such incompleteness makes it impossible to directly use traditional\nmulti-view clustering methods. In this paper, we propose a Doubly Aligned\nIncomplete Multi-view Clustering algorithm (DAIMC) based on weighted\nsemi-nonnegative matrix factorization (semi-NMF). Specifically, on the one\nhand, DAIMC utilizes the given instance alignment information to learn a common\nlatent feature matrix for all the views. On the other hand, DAIMC establishes a\nconsensus basis matrix with the help of $L_{2,1}$-Norm regularized regression\nfor reducing the influence of missing instances. Consequently, compared with\nexisting methods, besides inheriting the strength of semi-NMF with ability to\nhandle negative entries, DAIMC has two unique advantages: 1) solving the\nincomplete view problem by introducing a respective weight matrix for each\nview, making it able to easily adapt to the case with more than two views; 2)\nreducing the influence of view incompleteness on clustering by enforcing the\nbasis matrices of individual views being aligned with the help of regression.\nExperiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate its advantages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 09:25:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-08"}

Seasonal\nvariability is by far more relevant than between year variability, which\nconfirms that at least some fishers are adopting a rotation cycle of metiers\nalong the year. Effort, landings and gross revenues decreased in the last 12\nyears. The approach proposed is also applicable to any other fishery for which\nthe metier for a fishing trip sample is known, but relying on fishers expertise\npoints more directly to fishers intention. Thus, metier predictions produced\nwith the proposed approach are closer to the actual uses of fishers, providing\nbetter grounds for an improved management.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 09:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-08"}

A strong correlation between the orientation of LSC\nstructure and the heat transfer and boundary layer dynamics is observed.

A key obstacle to building accurate sketch recognizers has been the\ndifficulty of creating large amounts of annotated training data. Several\nauthors have attempted to address this issue by creating synthetic data, and by\nbuilding tools that support efficient annotation. Two prominent sets of\napproaches stand out from the rest of the crowd. They use interim classifiers\ntrained with a small set of labeled data to aid the labeling of the remainder\nof the data. The first set of approaches uses a classifier trained with a\npartially labeled dataset to automatically label unlabeled instances. The\nothers, based on active learning, save annotation effort by giving priority to\nlabeling informative data instances. The former is sub-optimal since it doesn't\nprioritize the order of labeling to favor informative instances, while the\nlatter makes the strong assumption that unlabeled data comes in an already\nsegmented form (i.e. the ink in the training data is already assembled into\ngroups forming isolated object instances). In this paper, we propose an active\nlearning framework that combines the strengths of these methods, while\naddressing their weaknesses. In particular, we propose two methods for deciding\nhow batches of unsegmented sketch scenes should be labeled. The first method,\nscene-wise selection, assesses the informativeness of each drawing (sketch\nscene) as a whole, and asks the user to annotate all objects in the drawing.\nThe latter, segment-wise selection, attempts more precise targeting to locate\ninformative fragments of drawings for user labeling. We show that both\nselection schemes outperform random selection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nprecise targeting yields superior performance. Overall, our approach allows\nreaching top accuracy figures with up to 30% savings in annotation cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 11:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-08"}

The shuffle model is the core idea in\nthe Encode, Shuffle, Analyze (ESA) model introduced by Bittau et al. (SOPS\n2017). Recent work by Cheu et al.

These unnecessary data samples lead to\nhigh computational effort in subsequent processing steps. Thus, point cloud\nsparsification or compression is often applied as a preprocessing step. The two\nstandard methods to compress dense 3D point clouds are random subsampling and\napproximation schemes based on hierarchical tree structures, e.g., octree\nrepresentations. However, both approaches give little flexibility for adjusting\npoint cloud compression based on a-priori knowledge on the geometry of the\nscanned object. Furthermore, these methods lead to suboptimal approximations if\nthe 3D point cloud data is prone to noise. In this paper we propose a\nvariational method defined on finite weighted graphs, which allows to sparsify\na given 3D point cloud while giving the flexibility to control the appearance\nof the resulting approximation based on the chosen regularization functional.\nThe main contribution in this paper is a novel coarse-to-fine optimization\nscheme for point cloud sparsification, inspired by the efficiency of the\nrecently proposed Cut Pursuit algorithm for total variation denoising. This\nstrategy gives a substantial speed up in computing sparse point clouds compared\nto a direct application on all points as done in previous works and renders\nvariational methods now applicable for this task.

We show that how a summarizer can discover\nmeaningful concepts within a biomedical text document using the Helmholtz\nprinciple. The summarizer considers the meaningful concepts as the main topics\nand constructs a graph based on the topics that the sentences share.

In this work, we detected cosmic filaments around\ngalaxy clusters using photometric redshifts in the range 0.15<z<0.7. We\ncharacterised galaxy populations in these structures to study the influence of\n\"pre-processing\" by cosmic filaments and galaxy groups on star-formation\nquenching. The cosmic filament detection was performed using the AMASCFI\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) T0007 cluster sample\n(Sarron et al. 2018). The filament reconstruction was done with the DISPERSE\nalgorithm in photometric redshift slices. We showed that this reconstruction is\nreliable for a CFHTLS-like survey at 0.15<z<0.7 using a mock galaxy catalogue.\nWe split our galaxy catalogue in two populations (passive and star-forming)\nusing the LePhare SED fitting algorithm and worked with two redshift bins\n(0.15<z<=0.4 and 0.4<z<0.7). We showed that the AMASCFI cluster connectivity\n(i.e. the number of filaments connecting to a cluster) increases with cluster\nmass M200. Filament galaxies outside R200 are found to be closer to clusters at\nlow redshift, whatever the galaxy type. Passive galaxies in filaments are\ncloser to clusters than star-forming galaxies in the low redshift bin only. The\npassive fraction of galaxies decreases with increasing clustercentric distance\nup to d~5 cMpc. Galaxy groups/clusters that are not located at nodes of our\nreconstruction are mainly found inside cosmic filaments. These results give\nclues for \"pre-processing\" in cosmic filaments, that could be due to smaller\ngalaxy groups. This trend could be further explored by applying this method to\nlarger photometric surveys such as HSC-SPP or Euclid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 12:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

In this study\nwe present the results from a cross-correlation analysis on data from Advanced\nLIGO's second observing run (O2), which we combine with the results of the\nfirst observing run (O1). We do not find evidence for a stochastic background,\nso we place upper limits on the normalized energy density in gravitational\nwaves at the 95% credible level of $\\Omega_{\\rm GW}<6.0\\times 10^{-8}$ for a\nfrequency-independent (flat) background and $\\Omega_{\\rm GW}<4.8\\times 10^{-8}$\nat 25 Hz for a background of compact binary coalescences. The upper limit\nimproves over the O1 result by a factor of 2.8. Additionally, we place upper\nlimits on the energy density in an isotropic background of scalar- and\nvector-polarized gravitational waves, and we discuss the implication of these\nresults for models of compact binaries and cosmic string backgrounds. Finally,\nwe present a conservative estimate of the correlated broadband noise due to the\nmagnetic Schumann resonances in O2, based on magnetometer measurements at both\nthe LIGO Hanford and LIGO Livingston observatories. We find that correlated\nnoise is well below the O2 sensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 12:53:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 09:08:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 13:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-11"}

Essentially, the\nweight value, which reflects physical, chemical and biological properties, can\nbe assigned to vertices (atom centers), edges (bonds), or higher order\nsimplexes (cluster of atoms), depending on the biomolecular structure,\nfunction, and dynamics properties. Further, we propose the first localized\nweighted persistent homology (LWPH). Inspired by the great success of element\nspecific persistent homology (ESPH), we do not treat biomolecules as an\ninseparable system like all previous weighted models, instead we decompose them\ninto a series of local domains, which may be overlapped with each other. The\ngeneral persistent homology or weighted persistent homology analysis is then\napplied on each of these local domains. In this way, functional properties,\nthat are embedded in local structures, can be revealed. Our model has been\napplied to systematically studying DNA structures. It has been found that our\nLWPH based features can be used to successfully discriminate the A-, B-, and\nZ-types of DNA. More importantly, our LWPH based PCA model can identify two\nconfigurational states of DNA structure in ion liquid environment, which can be\nrevealed only by the complicated helical coordinate system. The great\nconsistence with the helical-coordinate model demonstrates that our model\ncaptures local structure variations so well that it is comparable with\ngeometric models. Moreover, geometric measurements are usually defined in very\nlocal regions. For instance, the helical-coordinate system is limited to one or\ntwo basepairs. However, our LWPH can quantitatively characterize structure\ninformation in local regions or domains with arbitrary sizes and shapes, where\ntraditional geometrical measurements fail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 13:09:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-08"}

To address this problem, several compression methods\nhave been proposed in the distributed training literature that can reduce the\namount of required communication by up to three orders of magnitude. These\nexisting methods however are only of limited utility in the Federated Learning\nsetting, as they either only compress the upstream communication from the\nclients to the server (leaving the downstream communication uncompressed) or\nonly perform well under idealized conditions such as iid distribution of the\nclient data, which typically can not be found in Federated Learning.

When some of the\ncoded bits are punctured or shortened, it is equivalent to a situation in which\nthe underlying channels of the polar codes are different. Therefore, the\nquality of bit channels with puncturing or shortening differ from the original\nqualities, which can greatly affect the construction of polar codes. In this\npaper, a general construction of polar codes is studied in two aspects: 1) the\ntheoretical foundation of the construction; and 2) the hardware implementation\nof polar codes encoders. In contrast to the original identical and independent\nbinary-input, memoryless, symmetric (BMS) channels, these underlying BMS\nchannels can be different.

In the context of Stackelberg games, various approaches have been\nproposed to deal with the leader's incomplete knowledge about the follower's\npayoffs, typically by gathering information from the leader's interaction with\nthe follower. Unfortunately, these approaches rely crucially on the assumption\nthat the follower will not strategically exploit this information asymmetry,\ni.e., the follower behaves truthfully during the interaction according to their\nactual payoffs. As we show in this paper, the follower may have strong\nincentives to deceitfully imitate the behavior of a different follower type\nand, in doing this, benefit significantly from inducing the leader into\nchoosing a highly suboptimal strategy. This raises a fundamental question: how\nto design a leader strategy in the presence of a deceitful follower? To answer\nthis question, we put forward a basic model of Stackelberg games with\n(imitative) follower deception and show that the leader is indeed able to\nreduce the loss due to follower deception with carefully designed policies. We\nthen provide a systematic study of the problem of computing the optimal leader\npolicy and draw a relatively complete picture of the complexity landscape;\nessentially matching positive and negative complexity results are provided for\nnatural variants of the model. Our intractability results are in sharp contrast\nto the situation with no deception, where the leader's optimal strategy can be\ncomputed in polynomial time, and thus illustrate the intrinsic difficulty of\nhandling follower deception. Through simulations we also examine the benefit of\nconsidering follower deception in randomly generated games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 14:00:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 May 2019 14:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-21"}

Since then, further important information about A0538-66\nhave been obtained, and sophisticated photoionization codes have been developed\nto calculate the radiation emerging from a gas nebula illuminated by a central\nX-ray source. In the light of the new information and tools available, we\nstudied again the enhanced optical emission displayed by A0538-66 to understand\nthe mechanisms responsible for these unique events among the class of Be/XRBs.\nWe performed about 10^5 simulations of a gas envelope photoionized by an X-ray\nsource. We assumed for the shape of the gas cloud either a sphere or a\ncircumstellar disc observed edge-on. We studied the effects of varying the main\nproperties of the envelope and the influence of different input X-ray spectra\non the optical/UV emission emerging from the photoionized cloud.

The quality of\nthe reconstruction of the maps is critical to study the spatial distribution of\nphases and crystallographic orientation relationships between phases, a key\ninterest in materials science. However, EBSD data is known to suffer from\ndistortions that arise from several instrument and detector artifacts. In this\npaper, we present an unsupervised method that corrects those distortions, and\nenables or enhances phase differentiation in EBSD data. The method uses a\nsegmented electron image of the phases of interest (laths, precipitates, voids,\ninclusions) gathered using detectors that generate less distorted data, of the\nsame area than the EBSD map, and then searches for the best transformation to\ncorrect the distortions of the initial EBSD data. To do so, the Covariance\nMatrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is implemented to distort the\nEBSD until it matches the reference electron image. Fast and versatile, this\nmethod does not require any human annotation and can be applied to large\ndatasets and wide areas, where the distortions are important. Besides, this\nmethod requires very little assumption concerning the shape of the distortion\nfunction.

However, in situations where vehicle volumes\nincrease to the point that the physical capacity of a road network reaches or\nexceeds saturation, it has been observed that the effectiveness of a\nschedule-driven approach begins to degrade, leading to progressively higher\nnetwork congestion. In essence, the traffic control problem becomes less of a\nscheduling problem and more of a queue management problem in this circumstance.\nIn this paper we propose a composite approach to real-time traffic control that\nuses sensed information on queue lengths to influence scheduling decisions and\ngracefully shift the signal control strategy to queue management in high\nvolume/high congestion settings. Specifically, queue-length information is used\nto establish weights for the sensed vehicle clusters that must be scheduled\nthrough a given intersection at any point, and hence bias the wait time\nminimization calculation. To compute these weights, we develop a model in which\nsuccessive movement phases are viewed as different states of an Ising model,\nand parameters quantify strength of interactions. To ensure scalability, queue\ninformation is only exchanged between direct neighbors and the asynchronous\nnature of local intersection scheduling is preserved. We demonstrate the\npotential of the approach through microscopic traffic simulation of a\nreal-world road network, showing a 60% reduction in average wait times over the\nbaseline schedule-driven approach in heavy traffic scenarios. We also report\ninitial field test results, which show the ability to reduce queues during\nheavy traffic periods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 19:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

The model considers the transient effects of air\ntransport and its impact on the heat and moisture transfer. The achievement of\nthe mathematical model is detailed in the continuity of Luikov's work. A system\ncomposed of two advection-diffusion differential equations plus one exclusively\ndiffusion equation is derived. The main issue to take into account the\ntransient air transfer arises in the very small characteristic time of the\ntransfer, implying very fine discretisation. To circumvent these difficulties,\nthe numerical model is based on the Du Fort-Frankel explicit and\nunconditionally stable scheme for the exclusively diffusion equation. It is\ncombined with a two-step Runge-Kutta scheme in time with the Scharfetter-Gummel\nnumerical scheme in space for the coupled advection-diffusion equations. At the\nend, the numerical model enables to relax the stability condition, and,\ntherefore, to save important computational efforts. A validation case is\nconsidered to evaluate the efficiency of the model for a nonlinear problem.\nResults highlight a very accurate solution computed about 16 times faster than\nstandard approaches. After this numerical validation, the reliability of the\nmathematical model is evaluated by comparing the numerical predictions to\nexperimental observations. The latter is measured within a multi-layered wall\nsubmitted to a sudden increase of vapor pressure on the inner side and driven\nclimate boundary conditions on the outer side. A very satisfactory agreement is\nnoted between the numerical predictions and experimental observations\nindicating an overall good reliability of the proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 08:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-20"}

Compared with VO2-only devices,\nadding the nanotube heater dramatically decreases the transient duration and\npulse energy, and increases the spiking frequency, by up to three orders of\nmagnitude. This is caused by heating and cooling of the VO2 across its\ninsulator-metal transition being localized to a nanoscale conduction channel in\nan otherwise bulk medium.

Nonetheless, a single multivariate Gaussian is not an\nadequate model in cases with significant nonlinear shape variation or where the\nprior distribution is multimodal. Nonparametric density estimation is more\ngeneral, but has a ravenous appetite for training samples and poses serious\nchallenges in optimization, especially in high dimensional spaces. Here, we\npropose a maximum-a-posteriori formulation that relies on a generative image\nmodel by incorporating both local intensity and global shape priors. We use\ndeep autoencoders to capture the complex intensity distribution while avoiding\nthe careful selection of hand-crafted features. We formulate the shape prior as\na mixture of Gaussians and learn the corresponding parameters in a\nhigh-dimensional shape space rather than pre-projecting onto a low-dimensional\nsubspace. In segmentation, we treat the identity of the mixture component as a\nlatent variable and marginalize it within a generalized\nexpectation-maximization framework. We present a conditional maximization-based\nscheme that alternates between a closed-form solution for component-specific\nshape parameters that provides a global update-based optimization strategy, and\nan intensity-based energy minimization that translates the global notion of a\nnonlinear shape prior into a set of local penalties. We demonstrate our\napproach on the left atrial segmentation from gadolinium-enhanced MRI, which is\nuseful in quantifying the atrial geometry in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 2019 23:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-18"}
