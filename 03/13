We show that Sketched SGD has favorable convergence rates on several\nclasses of functions. When considering all communication -- both of gradients\nand of updated model weights -- Sketched SGD reduces the amount of\ncommunication required compared to other gradient compression methods from\n$\\mathcal{O}(d)$ or $\\mathcal{O}(W)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(\\log d)$, where $d$ is the\nnumber of model parameters and $W$ is the number of workers participating in\ntraining.

Due to complexity of quantum\nmany-body systems it is plausible that new developments in this field will be\nachieved by experimental explorations. Since noise effects are inevitably\npresent in experimental implementations, a better theoretical understanding of\nquantum information scrambling in systems affected by noise is needed. To\naddress this problem we study indicators of quantum scrambling --\nout-of-time-ordered correlation functions (OTOCs) in open quantum systems. As\nmost experimental protocols for measuring OTOCs are based on backward time\nevolution we consider two possible scenarios of joint system-environment\ndynamics reversal: In the first one the evolution of the environment is\nreversed, whereas in the second it is not. We derive general formulas for OTOCs\nin those cases as well as study in detail the model of a spin chain coupled to\nthe environment of harmonic oscillators.

Subsequently, assuming that dephasing dominates over dissipation,\nwe provide bounds on open system OTOCs and illustrate them for a spectral\ndensity known from the spin-boson problem.

The fundamental constants that\ndefine Cosmology, however, are largely determined via a handful of independent\ntechniques that are applied to even fewer datasets. The history of the\nmeasurement of the Hubble Constant (H0), which serves to anchor the expansion\nhistory of the Universe to its current value, is an exemplar of the\ndifficulties of cosmological measurement; indeed, as we approach the centennial\nof its first measurement, the quest for H0 still consumes a great number of\nresources. In this white paper, we demonstrate how the approaching era of\nExtremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) will transform the astrophysical measure of\nH0 from the limited and few into a fundamentally new regime where (i) multiple,\nindependent techniques are employed with modest use of large aperture\nfacilities and (ii) 1% or better precision is readily attainable. This quantum\nleap in how we approach H0 is due to the unparalleled sensitivity and spatial\nresolution of ELT's and the ability to use integral field observations for\nsimultaneous spectroscopy and photometry, which together permit both familiar\nand new techniques to effectively by-pass the conventional 'ladder' framework\nto minimize total uncertainty. Three independent techniques are discussed --\n(i) standard candles via a two-step distance ladder applied to metal, poor\nstellar populations, (ii) standard clocks via gravitational lens cosmography,\nand (iii) standard sirens via gravitational wave sources -- each of which can\nreach 1% with relatively modest investment from 30-m class facilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 16:37:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

A frequent question in the\nanalysis of multivariate compositional count data is what values of a\ncovariate(s) give rise to the observed composition. Learning the relationship\nbetween covariates and the compositional count allows for inverse prediction of\nunobserved covariates given compositional count observations. Gaussian\nprocesses provide a flexible framework for modeling functional responses with\nrespect to a covariate without assuming a functional form. Many scientific\ndisciplines use Gaussian process approximations to improve prediction and make\ninference on latent processes and parameters. When prediction is desired on\nunobserved covariates given realizations of the response variable, this is\ncalled inverse prediction. Because inverse prediction is mathematically and\ncomputationally challenging, predicting unobserved covariates often requires\nfitting models that are different from the hypothesized generative model. We\npresent a novel computational framework that allows for efficient inverse\nprediction using a Gaussian process approximation to generative models. Our\nframework enables scientific learning about how the latent processes co-vary\nwith respect to covariates while simultaneously providing predictions of\nmissing covariates. The proposed framework is capable of efficiently exploring\nthe high dimensional, multi-modal latent spaces that arise in the inverse\nproblem. To demonstrate flexibility, we apply our method in a generalized\nlinear model framework to predict latent climate states given multivariate\ncount data.

These simulations are often computationally demanding,\nwhich poses challenges for the optimizations. In this paper we present a new\ntwo-step surrogate treatment (ST) that reduces the computational expense\nassociated with well control optimization. The method is applicable for oil\nproduction via waterflood, with well rates optimized at a single control\nperiod. The two-step ST entails two separate optimizations, which can both be\nperformed very efficiently. In the first optimization, optimal well-rate ratios\n(i.e., the fraction of total injection or production associated with each well)\nare determined such that a measure of velocity variability over the field is\nminimized, leading to more uniform sweep. In the second step, overall injection\nand production rates are determined. The flow physics in the first step is\nhighly simplified, while the actual physical system is simulated in the second\nstep. Near-globally-optimal results can be determined in both cases, as the\nfirst optimization is posed as a QP problem, and the second step entails just a\nsingle optimization variable. Under full parallelization, the overall elapsed\ntime for the ST corresponds to the runtime for 1-2 full-order simulations.\nResults are presented for multiple well configurations, for 2D and 3D\nchannelized models, and comparisons with formal optimization procedures (MADS\nand adjoint-gradient) are conducted. Three different fluid mobility ratios (M =\n1, 3 and 5) are considered. Optimization results demonstrate that the two-step\nST provides results in reasonable agreement with those from MADS and\nadjoint-gradient, with speedups of 5x or more.

Furthermore,\nseveral ORFs coding for small polypeptides sPEP (less than 10 amino acids) and\nfor other unidentified proteins have been localised with unknown functionality.\nThe detailed analysis of the HIV virus replication and the virus proteomics are\nimportant for identifying which antigens are presented by macrophages to CD4\ncells, for localizing reactive epitopes or for creating transfer vectors to\ndevelop new HIV vaccines and effective therapies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 17:20:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 12:35:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-03"}

Following on from similar results for the `one\nhot' method of encoding discrete variables [Hadfield et. al.

I additionally\ndiscuss how, since the couplings in the domain wall encoding only need to be\nferromagnetic and therefore could in principle be much stronger than\nanti-ferromagnetic couplers, application specific quantum annealers for\ndiscrete problems based on this construction may be beneficial. Finally, I\ncompare embedding for synthetic scheduling and colouring problems with the\ndomain wall and one hot encodings on two graphs which are relevant for quantum\nannealing, the chimera graph and the Pegasus graph. For every case I examine I\nfind a similar or better performance from the domain wall encoding as compared\nto one hot, but this advantage is highly dependent on the structure of the\nproblem.

Nevertheless, a\ncommon issue in ESNs is determining its hyperparameters, which are crucial in\ninstantiating a well performing reservoir, but are often set manually or using\nheuristics. In this work we optimize the ESN hyperparameters using Bayesian\noptimization which, given a limited budget of function evaluations, outperforms\na grid search strategy. In the context of large volumes of time series data,\nsuch as light curves in the field of astronomy, we can further reduce the\noptimization cost of ESNs. In particular, we wish to avoid tuning\nhyperparameters per individual time series as this is costly; instead, we want\nto find ESNs with hyperparameters that perform well not just on individual time\nseries but rather on groups of similar time series without sacrificing\npredictive performance significantly. This naturally leads to a notion of\nclusters, where each cluster is represented by an ESN tuned to model a group of\ntime series of similar temporal behavior. We demonstrate this approach both on\nsynthetic datasets and real world light curves from the MACHO survey. We show\nthat our approach results in a significant reduction in the number of ESN\nmodels required to model a whole dataset, while retaining predictive\nperformance for the series in each cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 17:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-13"}

It is not directly\nobservable, but can be estimated from stellar population synthesis. Currently,\na galaxy's M/L is typically estimated from global fluxes. For example, a single\nglobal g - i colour correlates well with the stellar M/L. Spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) fitting can make use of all available fluxes and their\nerrors to make a Bayesian estimate of the M/L. We want to investigate the\npossibility of using morphology information to assist predictions of M/L. Our\nfirst goal is to develop and train a method that only requires a g-band image\nand redshift as input. This will allows us to study the correlation between M/L\nand morphology. Next, we can also include the i-band flux, and determine if\nmorphology provides additional constraints compared to a method that only uses\ng- and i-band fluxes. We used a machine learning pipeline that can be split in\ntwo steps. First, we detected morphology features with a convolutional neural\nnetwork. These are then combined with redshift, pixel size and g-band\nluminosity features in a gradient boosting machine. Our training target was the\nM/L acquired from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog, which uses global SED\nfitting and contains galaxies with z ~ 0.1. Morphology is a useful attribute\nwhen no colour information is available, but can not outperform colour methods\non its own. When we combine the morphology features with global g- and i-band\nluminosities, we find an improved estimate compared to a model which does not\nmake use of morphology. While our method was trained to reproduce global SED\nfitted M/L, galaxy morphology gives us an important additional constraint when\nusing one or two bands. Our framework can be extended to other problems to make\nuse of morphological information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-24"}

In this paper, we\nconsider the effects of magnon interactions in Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, showing that\ntheir inclusion greatly extends the reach of spin-wave theory.

We find no correlation between shells or\noutflows and any of the gas statistics. However, we find a significant\nanti-correlation between young star surface density and the slope of the\n$^{12}$CO spectral correlation function, suggesting that feedback may influence\nthis statistic. While calculating the principal components, we find peaks in\nthe covariance matrix of our molecular line maps offset by 1-3 km s$^{-1}$\ntoward several regions of the cloud which may be produced by feedback. We\ncompare these results to predictions from molecular cloud simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 18:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

In this\npaper, we provide the first characterisation of this effect in young (<20Myr)\nclusters.

To study this variability, it is appropriate to consider the joint\nprobability distribution function (pdf) of density and flow. We perform an\nempirical study of the variability in the relationship between flow and density\nusing 74 days of data from 64 sections of London's M25. The objectives are to\ndetermine how much of the variability in the flow-density relationship results\nfrom variable speed limits and to assess whether particular functional forms of\nthe fundamental diagram are systematically preferred. Empirically, the joint\npdf of flow and density is strongly bimodal, illustrating that traffic flows\nare often found in high-density or low-density regimes but rarely in between.\nWe find that the high-density regime is strongly affected by variable speed\nlimits whereas the low-density regime is not.

Under the planetary hypothesis, a natural\nquestion is how to reconcile the apparently high frequency of gap-carving\nplanets at 10-100 au with the paucity of Jupiter mass planets observed around\nmain sequence stars at those separations. Here, we provide an analysis of the\nnew-born planet population emerging from observations of gaps in discs, under\nthe assumption that the observed gaps are due to planets.

We show that\nthe mass of the inferred planets conforms to the theoretically expected trend\nfor the minimum planet mass needed to carve a dust gap.

While we confirm\nthe final results reported in the literature, we clarify several issues\nregarding intermediate infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) divergences, as well\nas the renormalization procedure. First, we properly identify the IR and UV\nsingularities using (only) dimensional regularization and the method of\nregions, which are the pillars of the EFT formalism. This requires a careful\nstudy of scaleless integrals in the potential region, as well as conservative\ncontributions from radiation modes due to tail effects. As expected by\nconsistency, the UV divergences in the near region (due to the point-particle\nlimit) can be absorbed into two counter-terms in the worldline effective\ntheory. The counter-terms can then be removed by field redefinitions, such that\nthe renormalization scheme-dependence has no physical effect to 4PN order. The\nremaining IR poles, which are spurious in nature, are unambiguously removed by\nimplementing the zero-bin subtraction in the EFT approach.

The\nmodels include a soft version of the simple exclusion principle, that is, as\nthe density in a site increases the effective entry rate into this site\ndecreases. This allows to model and study the evolution of \"traffic jams\" of\nparticles along the chain. A unique feature of these two new models is that\neach site along the chain can have a different size.\n  Although the models are nonlinear, they are amenable to rigorous asymptotic\nanalysis. In particular, we show that the dynamics always converges to a\nsteady-state, and that the steady-state densities along the chain and the\nsteady-state output flow rate from the chain can be derived from the spectral\nproperties of a suitable matrix, thus eliminating the need to numerically\nsimulate the dynamics until convergence. This spectral representation also\nallows for powerful sensitivity analysis, i.e. understanding how a change in\none of the parameters in the models affects the steady-state.\n  We show that the site sizes and the transition rates from site to site play\ndifferent roles in the dynamics, and that for the purpose of maximizing the\nsteady-state output (or production) rate the site sizes are more important than\nthe transition rates. We also show that the problem of finding parameter values\nthat maximize the production rate is tractable.\n  We believe that the models introduced here can be applied to study various\nnatural and artificial processes including ribosome flow during mRNA\ntranslation, the movement of molecular motors along filaments of the\ncytoskeleton, pedestrian and vehicular traffic, evacuation dynamics, and more.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 18:44:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-14"}

Due to the unknown factors in the human tests data, it\nis not suitable to use standard regression techniques that minimize the mean\nsquared error (MSE). We propose to use a Hidden Markov model (HMM) approach\nwhere human's attention is considered as a hidden state to infer whether the\ndata samples are relevant to learn the safety perception model.

For\npath planning, we use Bernstein polynomials for discretization, as the\nresulting path remains within the convex hull of the control points, providing\nguarantees for deconfliction with obstacles at low computational cost. An\nexample of optimal trajectory generation using the learned human model is\npresented. The optimal trajectory generated using the proposed model results in\nreasonable safety distance from the human.

Eccentricity significantly complicates the gravitational wave\nsignal, and we currently lack fast and accurate models that are valid in the\nmoderate to large eccentricity range. In a previous paper, we built a Fourier\ndomain, eccentric waveform model at leading order in the post-Newtonian\napproximation, i.e. as an expansion in small velocities and weak fields. Here\nwe extend this model to 3rd post-Newtonian order, incorporating the effects of\nperiastron precession and higher post-Newtonian order effects that\nqualitatively change the waveform behavior. Our 3PN model combines the\nstationary phase approximation, a truncated sum of harmonics of combinations of\ntwo orbital frequencies (an azimuthal one and a radial one), and a bivariate\nexpansion in the orbital separation and the eccentricity. We validate the model\nthrough comparisons with a fully-numerical, time domain post-Newtonian model,\nand find good agreement (matches between $97\\% - 99\\%$) in much of the\nparameter space. We estimate in what regions of parameter space eccentric\neffects are important by exploring the signal to noise ratio of eccentric\ncorrections. We also examine the effects of higher post-Newtonian order terms\nin the waveform amplitude, and the agreement between different PN-consistent,\nnumerical, time-domain models. In an effort to guide future improvements to the\nmodel, we gauge the error in our 3PN model incurred by the different analytic\napproximations used to construct it. This model is useful for preliminary data\nanalysis investigations and it could allow for a phenomenological hybrid that\nincorporates eccentricity into an inspiral-merger-ringdown model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 20:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-04"}

The key objective of this approach will be\nto make quick and cheap measurements of critical planetary characteristics on a\nlarge sample of exoplanets, exploiting statistical marginalization to answer\nbroad habitability questions. This relaxes the requirement of obtaining\nmultiple types of data for a given planet, as it allows us to test a given\nhypothesis from only one type of measurement using the power of an ensemble.\nThis approach contrasts with a \"systems science\" approach, where a few planets\nwould be extensively studied with many types of measurements. A systems science\napproach is associated with a number of difficulties which may limit overall\nscientific return, including: the limited spectral coverage and noise of\ninstruments, the diversity of exoplanets, and the extensive list of potential\nfalse negatives and false positives. A statistical approach could also be\ncomplementary to a systems science framework by providing context to interpret\nextensive measurements on planets of particular interest.

This problem is rooted in computational\nconvexity, and arises in applications such as verification and control of\ndynamical systems. The complexity heavily depends on how the polytopes are\nrepresented. Describing polytopes by their hyperplanes (H-polytopes) is a\npopular representation. In many applications we use affine transformations of\nH-polytopes, which we refer to as AH-polytopes. Zonotopes, orthogonal\nprojections of H-polytopes, and convex hulls/Minkowski sums of multiple\nH-polytopes can be efficiently represented as AH-polytopes. While there exists\nefficient necessary and sufficient conditions for AH-polytope in H-polytope\ncontainment, the case of AH-polytope in AH-polytope is known to be NP-complete.\nIn this paper, we provide a sufficient condition for this problem that is cast\nas a linear program with size that grows linearly with the number of\nhyperplanes of each polytope. Special cases on zonotopes, Minkowski sums,\nconvex hulls, and disjunctions of H-polytopes are studied.

Combining a\nGriffith inspired formulation for crack propagation, and a Gent inspired\nformulation for cavity expansion, we show that despite the apparent complexity\nof the fracture patterns, the pressure-volume response follows a predictable\npath.

The agreement between the simple theory and all of the experimental\nresults conducted in PDMS samples with shear moduli in the range of 25-246\n[kPa], confirms that cavitation and fracture work together in driving the\nexpansion process.

The two approaches are\ncross-lingual and monolingual POS tags projection. We used cross-lingual to\nautomatically create an initial 'errorful' tagged corpus for a target language\nvia word-alignment. The resources for creating this are derived from a source\nlanguage rich in NLP resources.

Therefore,\ndangerous attacks, such as disabling brakes, are possible and the safety of\npassengers is at risk. In this paper, we present TACAN (Transmitter\nAuthentication in CAN), which provides secure authentication of ECUs by\nexploiting the covert channels without introducing CAN protocol modifications\nor traffic overheads (i.e., no extra bits or messages are used). TACAN turns\nupside-down the originally malicious concept of covert channels and exploits it\nto build an effective defensive technique that facilitates transmitter\nauthentication via a trusted Monitor Node. TACAN consists of three different\ncovert channels for ECU authentication: 1) Inter-Arrival Time (IAT)-based,\nleveraging the IATs of CAN messages; 2) offset-based, exploiting the clock\noffsets of CAN messages; 3) Least Significant Bit (LSB)-based, concealing\nauthentication messages into the LSBs of normal CAN data. We implement the\ncovert channels on the University of Washington (UW) EcoCAR testbed and\nevaluate their performance through extensive experiments. We demonstrate the\nfeasibility of TACAN, highlighting no traffic overheads and attesting the\nregular functionality of ECUs. In particular, the bit error ratios are within\n0.1% and 0.42% for the IAT-based and offset-based covert channels,\nrespectively. Furthermore, the bit error ratio of the LSB-based covert channel\nis equal to that of a normal CAN bus, which is 3.1x10^-7%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 21:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-14"}

This is partly due to training and convention but\nalso roots in scientists' strong interests in simple visualization and\ninterpretability. As such, marginal feature ranking for some predictive tasks,\ne.g., prediction of cancer driver genes, is widely practiced in the process of\nscientific discoveries. In this work, we focus on marginal ranking for binary\nprediction, the arguably most common predictive tasks. We argue that the most\nwidely used marginal ranking criteria, including the Pearson correlation, the\ntwo-sample t test, and two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test, do not fully take\nfeature distributions and prediction objectives into account. To address this\ngap in practice, we propose two ranking criteria corresponding to two\nprediction objectives: the classical criterion (CC) and the Neyman-Pearson\ncriterion (NPC), both of which use model-free nonparametric implementations to\naccommodate diverse feature distributions. Theoretically, we show that under\nregularity conditions both criteria achieve sample-level ranking consistent\nwith their population-level counterpart with high probability. Moreover, NPC is\nrobust to sampling bias when the two class proportions in a sample deviate from\nthose in the population. This property endows NPC good potential in biomedical\nresearch where sampling bias is common. We demonstrate the use and relative\nadvantages of CC and NPC in simulation and real data studies. Our model-free\nobjective-based ranking idea is extendable to ranking feature subsets and\ngeneralizable to other prediction tasks and learning objectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Mar 2019 23:41:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 23:11:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 23:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

The pulse shape is parametrized, and multiple simulations are performed\nin which the parameters are adjusted until the desired response is induced.\nThese simulations are often computationally intensive, and the optimization by\niteration of parameters in forward simulations is then expensive and slow. In\nmany cases, the desired response can be expressed such that an instantaneous\ndifference between the actual and desired response can be calculated. In\nprinciple, a computer program used to perform the forward simulation could be\nmodified to adjust the instantaneous radiation drive automaticaly until the\ndesired instantaneous response is achieved.

By producing a group of possible future realizations for certain\nset of renewable generation plants, scenario approach has become one popular\nway for renewables uncertainty modeling. However, due to the complex spatial\nand temporal correlations underlying in renewable generations, traditional\nmodel-based approaches for forecasting future scenarios often require extensive\nknowledge, while fitted models are often hard to scale. To address such\nmodeling burdens, we propose a learning-based, data-driven scenario forecasts\nmethod based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), which is a class of\ndeep-learning generative algorithms used for modeling unknown distributions.

By varying $D$, we investigate the effect of interpopulation STDPs\non diverse population and individual properties of fast sparsely synchronized\nrhythms that emerge in both the I- and the E-populations. Depending on values\nof $D$, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) for\npopulation-averaged values of saturated interpopulation synaptic strengths are\nfound to occur, and they make effects on the degree of fast sparse\nsynchronization.

In this\npaper, we give a tutorial overview of the recent advances in UAV communications\nto address the above issues, with an emphasis on how to integrate UAVs into the\nforthcoming fifth-generation (5G) and future cellular networks. In particular,\nwe partition our discussions into two promising research and application\nframeworks of UAV communications, namely UAV-assisted wireless communications\nand cellular-connected UAVs,where UAVs serve as aerial communication platforms\nand users, respectively. Furthermore, we point out promising directions for\nfuture research and investigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 01:58:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 05:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-15"}

The SUtx is equipped with a reconfigurable antenna (RA)\nwhich divides the angular space into M sectors. The RA chooses one sector among\nM sectors for its data transmission to SUrx. The SUtx first senses the channel\nand monitors the activity of PU for a duration of T_{sen} seconds. We refer to\nthis period as channel sensing phase. Depending on the outcome of this phase,\nSUtx stays in this phase or enters the next phase, which we refer to as\ntransmission phase. The transmission phase itself consists of two phases:\nchannel training phase followed by data transmission phase. During the former\nphase, SUtx sends pilot symbols to enable channel training and estimation at\nSUrx. The SUrx selects the best beam (sector) for data transmission and feeds\nback the index of the selected beam as well as its corresponding channel gain.\nWe also derive the probability of determining the true beam and take into\naccount this probability in our system design. During the latter phase, SUtx\nsends data symbols to SUrx over the selected beam with constant power {\\Phi} if\nthe gain corresponding to the selected beam is bigger than the threshold\n{\\zeta}. We find the optimal channel sensing duration T_{sen}, the optimal\npower level {\\Phi} and a optimal threshold {\\zeta}, such that the ergodic\ncapacity of CR system is maximized, subject to average interference and power\nconstraints. In addition, we derive closed form expressions for outage and\nsymbol error probabilities of our CR system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 02:17:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-14"}

Co functionalization brings ferromagnetic ordering in\nthe bilayer which turns near half-metallic upon increasing the concentration.\nOn the other hand, Cr functionalization shows a transition from antiferro- to\nferromagnetic ordering upon increasing the concentration.

While significant autocorrelation observed in\nthe returns points towards market inefficiency, the increased predictive power\nis better for investors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 05:34:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

Current mainstream static slicing methods\noperate on the PDG (program dependence graph) or SDG (system dependence graph),\nbut these friendly graph representations may be expensive and error-prone for\nsome users. We attempt in this paper to study a light-weight approach of static\nprogram slicing, called Symbolic Program Slicing (SymPas), which works as a\ndataflow analysis on LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine). In our SymPas approach,\nslices are stored symbolically rather than procedure being re-analysed (cf.\nprocedure summaries). Instead of re-analysing a procedure multiple times to\nfind its slices for each callling context, SymPas calculates a single symbolic\n(or parameterized) slice which can be instantiated at call sites avoiding\nre-analysis; it is implemented in LLVM to perform slicing on its intermediate\nrepresentation (IR). For comparison, we systematically adapt IFDS\n(Interprocedural Finite Distributive Subset) analysis and the SDG-based slicing\nmethod (SDG-IFDS) to statically IR slice programs. Evaluated on open-source and\nbenchmark programs, our backward SymPas shows a factor-of-6 reduction in time\ncost and a factor-of-4 reduction in space cost, compared to backward SDG-IFDS,\nthus being more efficient. In addition, the result shows that after studying\nslices from 66 programs, ranging up to 336,800 IR instructions in size, SymPas\nis highly size-scalable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 06:31:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-14"}

The long time window path can be made very lightweight by\nreducing its channel capacity, yet still being able to learn useful temporal\nrepresentations for activity recognition. In this paper, we mainly focus on\nproposing a new model to improve the accuracy of HAR. In order to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of ARN model, we carried out extensive experiments on\nbenchmark datasets (i.e., OPPORTUNITY, UniMiB-SHAR) and compared with some\nconventional and state-of-the-art learning-based methods. Then, we discuss the\ninfluence of networks parameters on performance to provide insights about its\noptimization. Results from our experiments show that ARN is effective in\nrecognizing human activities via wearable datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 08:44:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 May 2019 08:41:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 13:05:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

Previous face liveness detection methods usually train a binary\nclassifier to differentiate between a fake face and a real face before face\nrecognition. The client identity information is not utilized in previous face\nliveness detection methods. However, in practical face recognition\napplications, face spoofing attacks are always aimed at a specific client, and\nthe client identity information can provide useful clues for face liveness\ndetection. In this paper, we propose a face liveness detection method based on\nthe client identity using Siamese network. We detect face liveness after face\nrecognition instead of before face recognition, that is, we detect face\nliveness with the client identity information. We train a Siamese network with\nimage pairs. Each image pair consists of two real face images or one real and\none fake face images. The face images in each pair come from a same client.\nGiven a test face image, the face image is firstly recognized by face\nrecognition system, then the real face image of the identified client is\nretrieved to help the face liveness detection.

In the modern world telecommunication systems could play a key role in\nensuring a successful emergency response by detecting such incidents through\nsignificant changes in calls and access to the networks. In this paper a\nmethodology is illustrated to detect such incidents immediately (with the delay\nin the order of milliseconds), by processing semantically annotated streams of\ndata in cellular telecommunication systems. In our methodology, live\ninformation about the position and status of phones are encoded as RDF streams.\nWe propose an algorithm that processes streams of RDF annotated\ntelecommunication data to detect abnormality. Our approach is exemplified in\nthe context of a passenger cruise ship capsizing. However, the approach is\nreadily translatable to other incidents. Our evaluation results show that with\na properly chosen window size, such incidents can be detected efficiently and\neffectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 09:24:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-14"}

Today, smartphones contain multiple\nembedded sensors and are able to collect useful sensing data about the user and\ninfer the user's context.

We propose a novel approach for cost-aware\nsensing when performing continuous latent context detection. The suggested\nmethod dynamically determines user's sensors sampling policy based on three\nfactors: (1) User's last known context; (2) Predicted information loss using\nKL-Divergence; and (3) Sensors' sampling costs. The objective function aims at\nminimizing both sampling cost and information loss. The method is based on\nvarious machine learning techniques including autoencoder neural networks for\nlatent context detection, linear regression for information loss prediction,\nand convex optimization for determining the optimal sampling policy. To\nevaluate the suggested method, we performed a series of tests on real-world\ndata recorded at a high-frequency rate; the data was collected from six mobile\nphone sensors of twenty users over the course of a week. Results show that by\napplying a dynamic sampling policy, our method naturally balances information\nloss and energy consumption and outperforms the static approach.% We compared\nthe performance of our method with another state of the art dynamic sampling\nmethod and demonstrate its consistent superiority in various measures. %Our\nmethods outperformed, and were able to improve we achieved better results in\neither sampling cost or information loss, and in some cases we improved both.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 09:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-14"}

However, for many\nanimal communities, significant arrangement in space can occur on shorter\ntimescales, where births and deaths are negligible. This phenomenon is\nparticularly prevalent in populations of larger, vertebrate animals who often\nreproduce only once per year or less. To understand spatial arrangements of\nanimal communities on such timescales, we use a class of diffusion-taxis\nequations for modelling inter-population movement responses between $N \\geq 2$\npopulations. These systems of equations incorporate the effect on animal\nmovement of both the current presence of other populations and the memory of\npast presence encoded either in the environment or in the minds of animals. We\ngive general criteria for the spontaneous formation of both stationary and\noscillatory patterns, via linear pattern formation analysis. For $N=2$, we\nclassify completely the pattern formation properties using a combination of\nlinear analysis and non-linear energy functionals. In this case, the only\npatterns that can occur asymptotically in time are stationary. However, for $N\n\\geq 3$, oscillatory patterns can occur asymptotically, giving rise to a\nsequence of period-doubling bifurcations leading to patterns with no obvious\nregularity, a hallmark of chaos. Our study highlights the importance of\nunderstanding between-population animal movement for understanding spatial\nspecies distributions, something that is typically ignored in species\ndistribution modelling, and so develops a new paradigm for spatial population\ndynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 09:51:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 May 2019 18:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-06"}

We propose that a non-commutative\ngeneralisation of this theory (in the sense of Connes' non-commutative geometry\nand Adler's Trace Dynamics) is a `quantum theory of gravity'. The theory is in\nfact a classical matrix dynamics with only two fundamental constants -- the\nsquare of the Planck length and the speed of light, along with the two string\ntensions as parameters. The guiding symmetry principle is that the theory\nshould be covariant under general coordinate transformations of non-commuting\ncoordinates.The action for this non-commutative torsion gravity can be\nelegantly expressed as an invariant area integral, and represents an atom of\nspace-time-matter. The statistical thermodynamics of a large number of such\natoms yields the laws of quantum gravity and quantum field theory, at\nthermodynamic equilibrium. Spontaneous localisation caused by large\nfluctuations away from equilibrium is responsible for the emergence of\nclassical space-time and the field equations of classical general relativity.\nThe resolution of the quantum measurement problem by spontaneous collapse is an\ninevitable consequence of this process. Quantum theory and general relativity,\nare both seen as emergent phenomena, resulting from coarse-graining of the\nunderlying non-commutative geometry. We explain the profound role played by\nentanglement in this theory: entanglement describes interaction between the\natoms of space-time-matter, and indeed entanglement appears to be more\nfundamental than quantum theory or space-time.

However, there are three\nlimiting factors that affect the deployability of MARL approaches to congestion\nproblems. These are learning time, scalability and decentralised coordination\ni.e. no communication between the learning agents. In this paper we introduce\nResource Abstraction, an approach that addresses these challenges by allocating\nthe available resources into abstract groups. This abstraction creates new\nreward functions that provide a more informative signal to the learning agents\nand aid the coordination amongst them. Experimental work is conducted on two\nbenchmark domains from the literature, an abstract congestion problem and a\nrealistic traffic congestion problem. The current state-of-the-art for solving\nmultiagent congestion problems is a form of reward shaping called difference\nrewards.

To construct the secret\nmatrix and renew it at each encryption, a bipolar keystream and a random\npermutation pattern are employed as cryptographic primitives, which can be\nobtained by a keystream generator of stream ciphers. With a small number of\nnonzero elements in the measurement matrix, the S-OTS cryptosystem achieves\nefficient CS encryption in terms of memory and computational cost. In security\nanalysis, we show that the S-OTS cryptosystem can be indistinguishable as long\nas each plaintext has constant energy, which formalizes computational security\nagainst ciphertext only attacks (COA). In addition, we consider a chosen\nplaintext attack (CPA) against the S-OTS cryptosystem, which consists of two\nsequential stages, keystream and key recovery attacks. Against keystream\nrecovery under CPA, we demonstrate that the S-OTS cryptosystem can be secure\nwith overwhelmingly high probability, as an adversary needs to distinguish a\nprohibitively large number of candidate keystreams. Finally, we conduct an\ninformation-theoretic analysis to show that the S-OTS cryptosystem can be\nresistant against key recovery under CPA by guaranteeing that the probability\nof success is extremely low. In conclusion, the S-OTS cryptosystem can be\ncomputationally secure against COA and the two-stage CPA, while providing\nefficiency in CS encryption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 12:03:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 2019 04:13:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 14:33:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 08:19:41 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 05:33:12 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 06:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

To\nour knowledge, there is no automatic method that can process animations and\nautomatically label actions and compatibility between them. In practice, a\nstate machine, where clips are the actions, is created manually by setting\nconnections between the states with the timing parameters for these\nconnections. Authoring this state machine for a large amount of motions leads\nto a visual overflow, and increases the amount of possible mistakes.

We demonstrate how increasing strength of these couplings affects on\nsuch stable periodic regimes as spiking in-phase, anti-phase and sequential\nactivity. We show that the presence of electrical and memristor-based coupling\ndoes not essentially affect regimes of in-phase activity. Such regimes do not\nchanges remaining stable ones. However, it is not the case for regimes of\nanti-phase and sequential activity. All such regimes can transform into\nperiodic or chaotic ones which are very similar to the regimes of in-phase\nactivity. Concerning the regimes of sequential activity, this transformation\ndepends continuously on the coupling parameters, whereas some anti-phase\nregimes can disappear via a saddle-node bifurcation and nearby orbits tend to\nregimes of in-phase activity. Also, we show that new interesting neuron-like\nphenomena can appear from the regimes of sequential activity when increasing\nthe strength of electrical and/or memristor-based coupling. The corresponding\nregimes can be associated with the appearance of spiral attractors containing a\nsaddle-focus equilibrium with homoclinic orbit and, thus, they correspond to\nchaotic motions near the invariant manifold of synchronization, which contains\nall in-phase limit cycles. Such new regimes can lead to the emergence of\nextreme events in the system of coupled neurons. In particular, the interspike\nintervals can become arbitrarily large when orbit pass very close to the\nsaddle-focus. Finally, we show that the further increase in the strength of\nelectrical coupling and/or memristor-based coupling leads to decreasing\ninterspike intervals and, thus, it helps to avoid such extreme behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 13:17:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-23"}

It is now possible to\nmeasure damping rates for hundreds of main-sequence and thousands of red-giant.\nHowever, among the seismic parameters, mode damping rates remain poorly\nunderstood and thus barely used for inferring the physical properties of stars.\nPrevious approaches to model mode damping rates were based on mixing-length\ntheory or a Reynolds-stress approach to model turbulent convection. While able\nto grasp the main physics of the problem, those approaches are of little help\nto provide quantitative estimates as well as a definitive answer on the\nrelative contribution of each physical mechanism. Our aim is thus to assess the\nability of 3D hydrodynamical simulations to infer the physical mechanisms\nresponsible for damping of solar-like oscillations. To this end, a solar\nhigh-spatial resolution and long-duration hydrodynamical 3D simulation computed\nwith the ANTARES code allows probing the coupling between turbulent convection\nand the normal modes of the simulated box. Indeed, normal modes of the\nsimulation experience realistic driving and damping in the super-adiabatic\nlayers of the simulation. Therefore, investigating the properties of the normal\nmodes in the simulation provides a unique insight into the mode physics. We\ndemonstrate that such an approach provides constraints on the solar damping\nrates and is able to disentangle the relative contribution related to the\nperturbation of the turbulent pressure, the gas pressure, the radiative flux,\nand the convective flux contributions. Finally, we conclude that using the\nnormal modes of a 3D numerical simulation is possible and is potentially able\nto unveil the respective role of the different physical mechanisms responsible\nfor mode damping provided the time-duration of the simulation is long enough.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 13:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

The models cover a range of possible ISM\nnumber densities of $n=50-200 {\\rm cm}^{-3}$ and stellar velocities of\n$v_{\\star}=20-40$ km s$^{-1}$. Synthetic H$\\alpha$ and 24 $\\mu$m emission maps\npredict the same apparent spherical bubble shape with quantitative properties\nsimilar to observations. The synthetic maps also predict a maximum brightness\nsimilar to that from the observations and agree that the maximum brightness is\nat the apex of the bow shock. The best-matching simulation had\n$v_{\\star}\\approx20$ km s$^{-1}$ into an ISM with $n\\sim100 {\\rm cm}^{-3}$, at\nan angle of 60$^\\circ$ with respect to the line of sight. Synthetic maps of\nsoft ($0.3-2$ keV) and hard ($2-10$ keV) X-ray emission show that the brightest\nregion is in the wake behind the star and not at the bow shock itself. The\nunabsorbed soft X-rays have luminosity $\\sim10^{32}-10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The\nhard X-rays are fainter, luminosity $\\sim 10^{30} - 10^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and\nmay be too faint for current X-ray instruments to successfully observe. Our\nresults imply that the O star creates a bow shock as it moves through the ISM\nand in turn creates an asymmetric bubble visible at optical and infrared\nwavelengths, and predicted to be visible in X-rays. The Bubble Nebula does not\nappear to be unique, it could be just a favourably oriented very dense bow\nshock. The dense ISM surrounding BD+60$^\\circ$2522 and its strong wind suggest\nthat it could be a good candidate for detecting non-thermal emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 14:17:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-01"}

SIM uses sophisticated optical systems to generate\npre-determined excitation light patterns, and reconstruction algorithms to\nenhance the resolution by up to a factor of two. The optical set-up of SIM\nrelies on delicate free-space optics to generate the light patterns, and a high\nnumerical aperture objective lens to project the pattern on the sample. These\narrangements are prone to miss-alignment, often with high costs, and with the\nfinal resolution-enhancement being limited by the numerical aperture of the\ncollection optics. Here, we present a photonic-chip based total internal\nreflection fluorescence (TIRF)-SIM that greatly reduces the complexity of the\noptical setup needed to acquire TIRF-SIM images. This is achieved by taking out\nthe light delivery from the microscope and transferring it to a photonic-chip.\nThe conventional glass slide is replaced by the planar photonic chip, that both\nholds and illuminates the specimen. The chip is used to create a standing wave\ninterference pattern, which illuminates the sample via evanescent fields. The\nphase of the interference pattern is controlled by the use of thermo-optical\nmodulation, leaving the footprint of the light illumination path for the SIM\nsystem to around 4 by 4 cm$^2$. Furthermore, we show that by the use of the\nphotonic-chip technology, the resolution enhancement of SIM can be increased\nabove that of the conventional approach. In addition, by the separation of\nexcitation and collection light paths the technology opens the possibility to\nuse low numerical objective lenses, without sacrificing on the SIM resolution.\nChip-based SIM represents a simple, stable and affordable approach, which could\nenable widespread penetration of the technique and might also open avenues for\nhigh throughput optical super-resolution microscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 14:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

In particular, for any given number of nodes $N$\nand diameter $D$, we identify networks that are maximally robust using the\nnotion of Kirchhoff index and then analyze their strong structural\ncontrollability. For this, we compute the minimum number of leaders, which are\nthe nodes directly receiving external control inputs, needed to make such\nnetworks controllable under all feasible coupling weights between agents. Then,\nfor any $N$ and $D$, we obtain a sharp upper bound on the minimum number of\nleaders needed to design strong structurally controllable networks with $N$\nnodes and diameter $D$. We also discuss that the bound is best possible for\narbitrary $N$ and $D$. Moreover, we construct a family of graphs for any $N$\nand $D$ such that the graphs have maximal edge sets (maximal robustness) while\nbeing strong structurally controllable with the number of leaders in the\nproposed sharp bound. We then analyze the robustness of this graph family. The\nresults suggest that optimizing robustness increases the number of leaders\nneeded for strong structural controllability. Our analysis is based on\ngraph-theoretic methods and can be applied to exploit network structure to\nco-optimize robustness and controllability in networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 14:54:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 05:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

The methodology\nis summarized in seven stages: pre-processing of the acquired CTA images,\nextraction of the vessel tree centerline, estimation of a weight function for\nlumen, outer wall and calcified plaque, lumen segmentation, outer wall\nsegmentation, plaque detection, and finally 3D surfaces construction. The\nmethodology was evaluated using both expert manual annotations and estimations\nof a recently presented Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) reconstruction method.\nAs far as the manual annotation validation process is concerned, the mean value\nof the comparison metrics for the 3D segmentation were 0.749 and 1.746 for the\nDice coefficient and Hausdorff distance, respectively. On the other hand, the\ncorrelation coefficients for the degree of stenosis 1, the degree of stenosis\n2, the plaque burden, the minimal lumen area and the minimal lumen diameter,\nwhen comparing the derived from the proposed methodology 3D models with the\nIVUS reconstructed models, were 0.79, 0.77, 0.75, 0.85, 0.81, respectively. The\nproposed methodology is an innovative approach for reconstruction of coronary\narteries, since it provides 3D models of the lumen, the outer wall and the CP\nplaques, using the minimal user interaction. Its first implementation\ndemonstrated that it provides an accurate reconstruction of coronary arteries\nand thus, it may have a wide clinical applicability\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 14:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-14"}

The\nintrinsic mechanisms of domain wall phenomena, especially AFD-FE\ncoupling-induced phenomena at the domain walls, have continued to intrigue the\nscientific and technological communities because of the need to develop the\nfuture nano-scale electronic devices. Over the past years, theoretical studies\noften show controversial results, owing to the fact that they are neither\nsufficiently nor directly corroborated with experimental evidences. In this\nwork, the AFD-FE coupling at uncharged 180{\\deg} and 71{\\deg} domain walls in\nBiFeO3 films are investigated by means of aberration-corrected scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy with high resolution (HR-STEM) and\nrationalized by phenomenological Landau-Ginsburg-Devonshire (LGD) theory. We\nreveal a peculiar morphology at the AFD-FE walls, including kinks, meandering,\ntriangle-like regions with opposite oxygen displacements and curvature near the\ninterface. The LGD theory confirms that the tilt gradient energy induces these\nunusual morphology and the features would change delicately with different\nkinds of domain walls. Moreover, the 180{\\deg} AFD-FE walls are proved to be\nconductive with an unexpected reduction of Fe-O-Fe bond angle, which is\ndistinct from theoretical predictions. By exploring AFD-FE coupling at domain\nwalls and its induced functionalities, we provide exciting evidences into the\nlinks between structural distortions and its electronic properties, which\nbenefit a lot for fundamental understanding for domain wall functionalities as\nwell as functional manipulations for novel nano-devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 15:03:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-18"}

We find\nthat a number of systems are greatly affected with absolute losses in\nclassification accuracy of up to $29\\%$ on the newly perturbed instances. Using\nthese newly generated instances, we construct a sample submission for the\nFEVER2.0 shared task. Addressing these types of attacks will aid in building\nmore robust fact-checking models, as well as suggest directions to expand the\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 15:29:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-14"}

For self-organized urban street networks, our paradigm has\nalready allowed us to recover the effectively observed scale-free distribution\nof roads and to foresee the distribution of junctions. The entropy conservation\nis interpreted as the conservation of the surprisal of the city-dwellers for\ntheir urban street network. In view to extend our investigations to other urban\nstreet networks, we consider to perturb our model for self-organized urban\nstreet networks by adding an external surprisal drift. We obtain the statistics\nfor slightly drifted self-organized urban street networks. Besides being\npractical and manageable, this statistics separates the macroscopic evolution\nscale parameter from the mesoscopic social parameters.

This paper presents an analytical\nstudy of the outage probability enhancement with multi-connectivity, and\nanalyses its cost in terms of resource usage. The performance analysis is\nfurther compared against conventional single-connectivity transmission. Our\nanalysis shows that, for transmission with a given block error rate target,\nmulti-connectivity results in more than an order of magnitude outage\nprobability improvement over the baseline single-connectivity scheme. However,\nsuch gains are achieved at the cost of almost doubling the amount of radio\nresources used. Multi-connectivity should thus be selectively used such that\nits benefits can be harnessed for critical users, while the price to pay in\nterms of resource utilization is simultaneously minimized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 11:07:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-18"}

Poeschl and E. Teller in 1933 is presented. This model\nincludes as particular cases two most popular and valuable models: the quasi\nfree particle in the box with impenetrable hard walls (i.e., the model with\nconfinement) and Bloch quantum harmonic oscillator, which is unconfined in\nspace; both models are frequently and effectively exploited in modern\nnanotechnology e.g., in quantum dots and magnetic traps. We give the extensive\nand elementary exposition of the potentials, wave functions and energetic\nspectra of all these interconnected models. Moreover, the pressure operator is\ndefined following the lines of G. Helmann and R. Feynman which were the first\nwho introduced this idea in the late 30ies in quantum chemistry. By these means\nthe baroenergetic equation of state is obtained and analyzed for all three\nmodels; in particular, it is shown the absence of the pressure for the Bloch\noscillator due to the infinite width of the box. The generalization of these\nresults on the case of nonzero temperature will be given later.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 11:25:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-07"}
